# 一贯天机直讲

Alas! Is not the human heart inherently good? Yet what causes it to stray from goodness is but the coercion of circumstances and the pressures of the times. When the pursuit of fame and profit runs rampant, snares are already set and pitfalls laid—even the worthy can only soar high and far, concealing themselves beyond the dust of the world. Why is this? They refuse to drift with the current or ride the waves to violate the Dao, nor will they engage in scheming and contention to lose their true nature. By withdrawing from the world and transcending appearances, avoiding entanglement in words to escape the constraints of verbal explanation—is this not what is meant by the Great Dao of preserving authenticity?

What humans receive from Heaven is fundamentally an empty, luminous awareness, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs. Yet when enticed by the clamor of external things and obscured by the tumult of human desires, their bright virtue is thus dimmed. Hence, those deeply mired in cravings have shallow celestial potential, while those less swayed by worldly allure preserve their nature and life. This is why the worthy sages of orderly ages must cultivate indifference to fame and wealth to clarify their aspirations, and why the transcendent immortals and buddhas of otherworldly realms must embrace purity to return to the origin—is it not for this very reason?

Upon examining the three teachings of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, I find they share a common source, their essence lying in restraining anger, curbing desires, and mastering the self to return to propriety as the gateway to virtue. Thus, scriptures such as the *Yinfu Jing*, *Daode Jing*, and *Xinyin Jing*, along with works like the *Great Learning* and *Doctrine of the Mean*, all take self-cultivation, bright virtue, purity, and non-action as their foundation. They do not rely on figurative language, unlike other Daoist texts replete with metaphors—tortoises and snakes, dragons and tigers, lead and mercury, alchemical furnaces—obscure imagery that leaves readers bewildered, as if lost in a thick fog, even leading some to mistakenly believe in elixir consumption, talismans, bedroom arts, or alchemical refinement.

Surveying the literati and officials, many retreat into Chan monasteries in their later years to seek enlightenment of the mind and nature. Initially, they may have been drawn to the teachings of longevity and ascension, but finding the terminology and principles too abstruse, they turn instead to Chan’s simplicity and direct pointing. Thus, Buddhism flourishes while Daoism wanes, and the Great Dao grows ever more obscured.

Since my *jiazi* year in Jiaozhou, when I served as director, I have studied the teachings of the Complete Perfection school. However, burdened by official duties, I could not devote myself wholeheartedly, and my gains were meager. Recently, seeking refuge from the clamor of the old capital, I chanced upon the book *Direct Explications of the Celestial Mechanism of Unity* in a bookshop. Upon perusal, I learned it was compiled by the Perfected One Wei Zezhi of Western Shu, a recent lecture series delivered in Beijing during the *jiazi* year of the Republic. It meticulously annotates the essence of the three teachings and the profound meanings of various scriptures, exhaustively elucidating them—truly a rarity among Daoist texts through the ages. All the secret oral instructions for cultivating authenticity, along with the esoteric doctrines of the Mysterious School, Buddhist classics, and the mysteries of pre- and post-celestial realms, are clearly annotated, making everything plain at a glance. It serves as a golden needle and precious raft for those cultivating without a teacher. If one practices diligently according to its guidance, not only can one prolong life and enhance vitality, but even ascension to the immortal registers is attainable.

I had intended to publish it promptly to disseminate it widely and remedy the world’s decline. However, in the third volume, the commentary on the seventeenth chapter of the *Yinfu Jing* was missing a page, leaving the work incomplete. After searching for years, I could not locate it. Reluctantly, I left a blank space for this chapter and proceeded with publication. Most remarkably, the day before typesetting, Li Qunwenhao, an employee of the bookshop, happened upon a tattered third volume at a stall near Desheng Gate. Within it lay the missing commentary on the seventeenth chapter of the *Yinfu Jing*. I obtained it as if gaining a priceless treasure, immediately transcribed it into the original book, and sent it to the typesetter. Without the unseen protection of divine spirits, how could this have come to pass?

On the day preceding the Beginning of Winter in the year *xinsi* of the thirty-first year of the Republic (1941), respectfully inscribed by Gao Enhong of Ding’an, Penglai

**Preface II**

For over twenty years, I have revered the Great Dao of the Mysterious and True. Yet the alchemical classics and Daoist scriptures I have perused are replete with cryptic phrases and enigmatic expressions, rendering them exceedingly difficult to comprehend. Could it be that their authors, fearing transmission to the unworthy, deliberately employed manifold metaphors to veil their teachings from plain sight?

Master Gao Ding’an of Penglai has long devoted himself to the study of the Dao. In his daily cultivation of body and mind, he has profoundly grasped the *samādhi* of nurturing the True. Though nearing seventy in years, he appears no older than a man in his forties. The depth of his practice is truly exemplary.

His collection of ancient and modern Daoist texts includes many rare works. I have been fortunate to receive his repeated generosity in sharing them, from which I have greatly benefited. Among these, the *Direct Explication of the Celestial Mechanism of the One Unifying Principle* stands as the lodestar of modern Daoist literature. Alas, its original printing is blurred, and the book itself has become exceedingly scarce, making it difficult to acquire and study—an undeniable regret.

This work expounds the stages of practice with meticulous clarity, tracing each step to its source. Should Confucians encounter it, they may fathom principle and fulfill their nature to attain sageliness; Buddhists, they may illuminate the mind and perceive their nature to achieve buddhahood; Daoists, they may cultivate the True and nurture their nature to become immortals. If we but follow its guidance in practice, those in the world may receive the authentic transmission of sages and worthies, fulfilling the human Dao of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world pacification; those beyond the world may grasp the wondrous truths of immortals and buddhas, fulfilling the celestial Dao of emptiness and purity.

For the learning that unifies the Three Teachings—though their paths differ, their destination is the same—this volume encompasses the vast, profound, and subtle ultimate Dao in its entirety, serving as a compass for all who seek the Way.

In former years, Master Gao diligently served the nation, overseeing transportation and education, and his meritorious contributions to public welfare earned renown at home and abroad. Though he has since retired to a life of seclusion, his heart remains set on benefiting the world even in his leisure. Recently, he took up this work, meticulously proofread it, and generously funded its carving and printing to ensure its wide dissemination.

I know that once this book is broadly circulated, the Great Dao of the Mysterious and True will surely flourish day by day. The misguided may be corrected, the deluded may awaken, and none shall stray into heterodox paths or suffer harm. Its benefit to the world’s moral order and the human heart will be profound indeed.

Respectfully inscribed by Ye Yian, a later student, on the day of the Beginning of Winter in the year *xinsi*

**Opening of the *Direct Explication of the Celestial Mechanism of the One Unifying Principle***

The Dao has long been obscured: the worthy overshoot it, while the unworthy fall short. The Dao has long gone unenacted: the wise overshoot it, while the foolish fall short. Both overshooting and falling short deviate from the Mean.

The Great Dao resides precisely in the Mean—it is no lofty, unattainable endeavor. Thus Confucius was called the Sage of Timely Centrality, and the two books *The Great Learning* and *The Doctrine of the Mean* became the transmitted teachings of the Sage’s school, unchanging through the ages. Yet precisely because it is so ordinary, few truly understand it. Even sages as wise as Yan [Yuan] and Min [Sun] could not grasp its principles without a teacher. This is why the sages of the Three Teachings all used the character *zhong* (centrality) to represent it.

Centrality is the unchanging principle of the world. "Not deviating" is called *zhong*; "not altering" is called *yong*. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"Qian operates through simplicity in knowing; Kun operates through simplicity in functioning."* The words "simplicity" and "ease" are none other than the Mean. The Way of the Mean lies within the ordinary affairs of daily life. Thus it is said: *"The hundred clans use it daily yet do not know it."*

This Dao can be spoken of, yet it is not the constant Dao. It is the human Dao, and it is also the Heavenly Dao. Heaven attains it and becomes clear; Earth attains it and becomes tranquil; valleys attain it and become full; humans attain it and live long; kings and lords attain it to become the steadfast pillars of the world.

Laozi said: *"Attain the One, and all things are complete."* The One is singularity, supremacy, the Great One, the Supreme Ultimate. It is one and numinous, and as the unchanging source of all things, its generation of beings is unfathomable. Zengzi said: *"My Way is unified by the One."* For the One is the undivided image of the Two Modes, the primordial *qi* that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things. In the Supreme Ultimate, it is the primordial *qi*; in Heaven, it is emptiness and numinosity; on Earth, it is the steadfast origin and the *qi* of life. When humans receive it, it becomes their nature and life—this is the Dao.

Follow it, and you fully receive and fully return to it; the Dao is within you. This is the highest virtue, the achievement of sudden perfection. As for lesser virtue, it must be cultivated. What is cultivation? It is the cultivation of the Way of nature and life. Since it is called cultivation, there must be methods and transmission—this is why it is called teaching, the gradual method.

In truth, Heaven and Earth cannot exist a single day without the Dao; without the Dao, Heaven and Earth would collapse. Humans cannot be separated from the Dao for even a moment; separated from the Dao, they cannot live. Yet worldly people, confined within the six senses and seven emotions, are so habituated to the Dao that they do not recognize it—just as fish swim daily in water yet do not know it as water.

Our nation established its teachings on the Dao. Confucianism and Daoism were originally one family, both without ritual forms. Only since the Qin and Han dynasties have distinctions arisen.

Thus, Confucians established their own robes and caps, while Zhang Zhengyi, the Celestial Master, further defined the vestments of the Daoist tradition. The *Han Shu: Yi Wen Zhi* further distinguished the teachings of Confucianism and Daoism, thereby forming the formal structures of religion. With the arrival of Buddhism in China, the term "Three Teachings" emerged. Thereafter, Confucians sank into philology and literary composition, Daoists fell into talismans and incantations, and Buddhists flowed into ritual fasts and sutra-chanting—obscuring the Great Dao entirely.

Later, Islam and Western Christianity entered, making Five Teachings in all. Examined impartially, their principles are fundamentally the same. Yet those within each tradition seek only in forms and appearances, utterly unaware of the "Doctrine of the Mean"—this is why the world is in chaos.

Now, at the extremity of decline, change arises, and through change comes understanding. In our nation, many turn to the gates of the Three Teachings to study the learning of nature and life. Yet some stray into heterodox schools, while others fall into external paths. Otherwise, they remain in the lower vehicle of sensory forms, chanting sutras, prostrating in repentance, or praying to the Dipper for blessings—far removed from the Dao, let alone the supreme vehicle, the highest and most transcendent Primordial Great Dao!

By the grace of Heaven, I have been fortunate to hear the wondrous truth from a true master and have studied the classics of the Three Teachings, gaining some insight. Not daring to keep this secret, I gather like-minded companions to discuss and elucidate the true principles of alchemical texts and Buddhist sutras, lest future generations be led astray.

Compared to past ritual codes, this may risk revealing celestial secrets. Yet in this age, great principles are perverted and subtle teachings lost—one cannot remain silent. Therefore, I have carefully arranged the stages of the "fire times" and disordered their sequence, slightly concealing their meaning to allow seekers to realize it for themselves.

May my fellow practitioners keep this secret in their cultivation and not transmit it carelessly. Moreover, this Dao must be verified through practice: those with keen wisdom may suddenly ascend to the highest realm, attaining sagehood at once, while those of duller faculties may gradually awaken to perfect enlightenment. How can this compare to those who merely form societies and gatherings to propagate the Dao?

*Inscribed by Houjue Daoren Wei Yao on the Winter Solstice of the Jiazi year*
*Direct Teachings of the Celestial Mechanism, Scroll One, First Lecture*

The Qian and Kun, Kan and Li serve as the bellows and hinge of Heaven and Earth, while the inner and outer voids turn the hub and true axle. The Eight Trigrams are divided into Prior Heaven and Posterior Heaven, and thus Qian and Kun must also be distinguished as Prior and Posterior. Prior Heaven is the essence, Posterior Heaven the function.

The so-called "Qian" and "Kun" are the one yin and one yang, born of the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate arises from the Ultimateless, and the Ultimateless is truly Non-Being. From the Ultimateless emerges the Supreme Ultimate, whose essence remains formless—its image is ○. When the Supreme Ultimate moves, it generates one qi, its image ⊙, still without form or appearance, invisible to sight and inaudible to hearing—this is the qi of the one yang.

When the formless qi is full, it gives rise to the formed qi, which is stillness generating yin. Thus, the formless qi, being pure and light, ascends to become Heaven, or Qian; the formed qi, being heavy and turbid, descends to congeal as Earth, or Kun. Their image is ☰, and the Two Modes are established. Above is Heaven, below is Earth, and between them lies the true void. Within this true void, there is still a Supreme Ultimate. Without qi or formed qi, combining the formless qi of Heaven and the formed qi of Earth, they become three. Three is one—its image is ☰—Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand li. At the midpoint of twenty-four thousand li lies the true void, forming a Supreme Ultimate known as the "Great Central Ultimate," also called the "Heart of Heaven and Earth," abbreviated as the "Heavenly Heart" or "Dao Heart."

Once the Two Modes are divided, yin and yang interact, qi and formed qi intermingle, further dividing into the Four Images. Their image is ☲☵: yang envelops yin, with formless qi on the outside and formed qi within, becoming the sun; yin envelops yang, with formed qi on the outside and formless qi within, becoming the moon. Between Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon, there is still a center—the true void of the Supreme Ultimate. Combining Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon makes five; five is three, and three is one.

Guangchengzi taught the Yellow Emperor the Dao of Three-in-One, and *The Awakening to Reality* states, "Three, five, and one—these three words; rare are those who truly understand them through the ages," referring precisely to this. One is the Supreme Ultimate before Heaven and Earth divided; three is the Supreme Ultimate after Heaven and Earth divided; five is the Supreme Ultimate after the Four Images were established. The Supreme Ultimate envelops Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth in turn envelop the Supreme Ultimate.

To illustrate with an object: consider a chicken egg, within which there is a small void of pale yellow, enveloped by yellow, which is further enveloped by white, while both ends of the egg have air pockets. Its image is as follows: the central void is the internally contained Supreme Ultimate, the white and yellow are Heaven and Earth, and the air pockets at the ends are the externally enveloping Supreme Ultimate. This is but one example; in truth, the generation and transformation of all things in Heaven and Earth share the same pattern as the great creation—all originate from the central void and are subsequently augmented from without. The embryos of animals and the seeds of plants are no exception. Thus can the divine marvel of creation be perceived.

Those who cultivate the Dao observe the great creation and take it as their model, returning from four to two, from two to one, from the substantial to the void, from Posterior Heaven to Prior Heaven—all beginning within this void, returning to the original Supreme Ultimate. The sages of the Three Teachings all use the character "middle" (中) to represent the Supreme Ultimate and describe this void essence. The essence of the Supreme Ultimate is ○; adding the line of principle and qi (丨) forms the character "middle" (中). "Middle" signifies emptiness, penetration; combining two "middles" forms the character "pervade" (貫). The ancient form of "pervade" appears as 毌. Within the cultivator’s body is one "middle," and outside the body is another "middle"; combining the two "middles" forms "pervade," as in "My Dao pervades all with one thread," and the Dao of the *Doctrine of the Mean* is attained.

Moreover, "middle" means correctness, the absence of bias. No material object can be unbiased and correct, for all are partial. Only the void is perfectly centered, unbiased, boundless without and infinitesimal within—thus can the essence of the Supreme Ultimate be perceived.

*The Seal of the Unity of the Three* states: "Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes, the parents of all trigrams." Qian is yang, and the yang qi is formless—depicted by a single unbroken line (一) to represent it. Kun is yin, and the yin qi is formed—depicted by a broken line (一 一) to represent it. Accumulating three lines forms Qian ☰, which is Heaven; accumulating six lines forms Kun ☷, which is Earth. "Three generates the myriad things," and the character "three" (三) also implies completion, beginning and ending—thus trigrams are formed by accumulating three lines.

Qian and Kun interact to form Li and Kan; Heaven and Earth interact to form the sun and moon. Qian and Kun employ Li and Kan as their function; Heaven and Earth employ the sun and moon as their function. What is the "Change" (*Yi*)? It is precisely the sun and moon. Daoists call it the "elixir" (丹), combining "sun above" and "moon below" to form the character *dan*; Buddhists call it "brightness" (明), combining "sun on the left" and "moon on the right" to form the character *ming*; Confucians call it the "Change" (易), also combining "sun above" and "moon below" to form the character *yi*. Change, brightness, elixir—all are one.

The function of Heaven and Earth is manifested through daily use: the accumulation of their ascent and descent gives rise to cold and heat, dividing the four seasons. The transformation and generation of the myriad things all pass through the four seasons to achieve completion. The East is the qi of wood, corresponding to spring—wood possesses the virtue of generation, and the myriad things are born. The South is the qi of fire, corresponding to summer—fire possesses the ascending virtue, and the myriad things grow.

The West is the qi of metal, corresponding to autumn—metal possesses the power to kill, and the myriad things wither upon encountering it. The North is the qi of water, corresponding to winter—water is the qi of storage, and the myriad things lie concealed. These are the qi of the Five Phases in their primordial state.

This is attested in the ancient *Hetu* (*River Diagram*): two and seven are in front, one and six behind, three and eight to the left, four and nine to the right, and five and ten reside in the center. One and six represent the northern direction, *ren* and *gui* water; two and seven represent the southern direction, *bing* and *ding* fire; three and eight represent the eastern direction, *jia* and *yi* wood; four and nine represent the western direction, *geng* and *xin* metal; five and ten represent the central *wu* and *ji* earth. The central five symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate, containing the Four Images within its emptiness—formless yet inwardly enfolding wondrous being, and further symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate’s embrace of primordial qi.

Speaking of their initial transformations: the yang qi of Heaven One is by nature moist and quiescent, named water, and stored in the North. The North is the *kun* direction of completion and ending, thus symbolizing winter. Winter governs return and storage, serving as the root of the myriad things’ generation. The yin qi of Earth Two is by nature ascending and dynamic, named fire, and attached to the South. The South is the supremely honored *qian* direction, thus symbolizing summer. Summer governs growth and nourishment, the time when the myriad images intermingle in brightness.

The East Three combines the qi of Heaven One and Earth Two to form its nature, governing generation, its qi warm—thus symbolizing spring, mild and possessing the virtue of benevolence. The West Four combines the qi of two waters and one fire, its nature governing killing, its qi cool—thus symbolizing autumn, stern and possessing the virtue of righteousness and resolve. Qi that is stirred and surging becomes wind; thus, the winds of East, South, West, and North each follow their nature, and generation, growth, killing, and storage perfectly accord with their virtues.

Metal, wood, water, and fire occupy the four directions, while the space between them is named five, the qi of earth. Earth flourishes in all four seasons, concealed within metal, wood, water, and fire. The myriad things are born from emptiness, established through emptiness—there is nothing that does not contain emptiness within. Thus, the qi of earth circulates through the Four Images, present everywhere. These are the Five Phases of primordial qi transformation. On earth, they manifest as the five forms of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth; in humans, they correspond to the five constants of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness.

Benevolence arises from nature, sincerity within manifesting without—like the East Three’s generative qi. Righteousness arises from emotion, external stimuli resonating within—like the West Four’s stern and resolute qi. Propriety is born of the heart, outwardly expressed as refinement—like the South Two’s fire. Wisdom emerges from the body, inwardly containing ingenuity—like the North One’s water. Trustworthiness responds from the central palace, the wondrous being of the central palace—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom all depend on trustworthiness to be realized. Trustworthiness is the foundation of human integrity, like the central earth flourishing in all four seasons. Thus, true intention is called true earth, the true sovereign of both nature and life in dual cultivation.

Why is it named the "gate and door"? The cosmos may be likened to a chamber: *qian* and *kun* extend its doorframe, while the sun and moon pass through it in their movements—such is its image. The generation and transformation of the myriad things arise from the Five Phases; the waxing and waning of the Five Phases arise from the sun and moon. One ascent and one descent divide day and night; one departure and one return complete cold and heat.

Today, as the time coincides with the Winter Solstice, it is precisely the day when the sun and moon exchange their light. The sun and moon intersect north and south: the sun above, the moon below, the moon absorbing the sun’s light, and the first yang is born. From one yang to two yang, then three yang—when abundance peaks, decline follows. When the time coincides with the Summer Solstice, the sun and moon intersect east and west: the sun absorbs the moon’s qi, and yin is born. From one yin to two yin, then three yin—when yin wanes, yang returns. Again, the Winter Solstice arrives, and the sun completes one circuit of the heavens, requiring one year. As for the moon’s movement, it completes one circuit each month.

All these movements of the sun and moon are the waxing and waning of the yin and yang qi, opening and closing without fail—this is why it is called the gate and door. *Qian* and *kun* are also the "parents of all hexagrams": *qian* is the ancestor of all yang, the father; *kun* is the ancestor of all yin, the mother. Father and mother unite, yin and yang intersect, giving birth to sons and daughters. *Qian* seeks once from *kun*, obtaining its first line, and *xun* is born, the eldest daughter. *Kun* seeks once from *qian*, obtaining its first line, and *zhen* is born, the eldest son. A second seeking produces *li* and *kan*, the middle daughter and middle son; a third seeking produces *dui* and *gen*, the youngest daughter and youngest son—thus, three daughters and three sons, as explained by the line counts.

At the initial intersection of *qian* and *kun* qi, *kan* and *li* are born first, followed by *gen* and *dui*, and finally *zhen* and *xun*. After the six children are born, *qian* and *kun* grow old, retiring to the northwest and southwest, allowing the middle son and middle daughter to assume their proper roles and heed their commands. Thus it is said: "*Qian* and *kun* are the body; *kan* and *li* are the function." *Li* is yang without and yin within—the sun; *kan* is yin without and yang within—the moon. After Heaven and Earth are established in their positions, they open their gate and door, allowing the sun and moon to move and complete creation—this is the meaning of "function."

From the doubling of the eight trigrams arise the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines. Tracing the flow to explore the source, examining the end to fathom the root—all emerge from the two hexagrams *qian* and *kun*, the two lines of one yin and one yang.

Thus it is said: "*Qian* and *kun* are the parents of all hexagrams."

Now, considering *qian*, *kun*, *li*, and *kan* as they manifest in the human body: *qian*-Heaven is *xing* (nature), *kun*-Earth is *ming* (destiny). *Xing* is the root of nature, *ming* the stem of destiny. *Li* is the acquired *xing*, *kan* the acquired *ming*. The first chapter of the *Huangting Jing* states:

> Above dwells the hun-spirit, below the Gate of Origin;
> Left is Lesser Yang, right Greater Yin.
> Behind lies the Secret Door, before the Gate of Life—
> Exhaling moon, inhaling sun, breath abides therein.

These six—above, below, front, back, left, and right—implicitly contain a central point, which is emptiness. The Great Emptiness takes Heaven and Earth as its true womb, the sun and moon as its true breath. The rising and setting of the sun and moon are the exhalation and inhalation of the Great Emptiness. Likewise, the breath within the human body mirrors the Great Emptiness, its egress and ingress refined by a sun and moon—also named *kan* and *li*. These *kan* and *li* are the acquired *xing* and *ming*.

The gates of *qian* and *kun* in the human body correspond to above and below. In the Dao of the Elixir, *qian* is also called the crucible, and *kun* the furnace, with the Great Emptiness as the *qian*-crucible and the Great Ultimate as the *kun*-furnace. The emptiness within the human body is the Great Emptiness; the empty apertures within the human body are the Great Ultimate. Thus, the eight gates and nine apertures are all portals of the human body—all are the Great Ultimate.

The *Daode Jing* states: "Abide in non-desire to observe its mysteries; abide in desire to observe its apertures." The mysteries are the Great Emptiness; the apertures are the Great Ultimate. The method of observation lies in stilling all thoughts to observe the mysteries and focusing the mind unwaveringly to observe the apertures. The "non-desire" and "desire" refer to "stilling all thoughts" and "focusing the mind unwaveringly," not the presence or absence of worldly desires.

When the scholar enters seclusion, spirit and *qi* intermingle, merging into oneness. Over time, they return to primordial chaos, entering the realm of nothingness. This is the state of no thought arising, wherein one may observe the mysteries. Yet the active mind is stilled, not the illuminating mind—wisdom remains yet is not employed, awareness persists within non-awareness, naturally and without contrivance, the luminous essence shining forth. This is the state of unwavering focus, wherein one may observe the apertures.

The wondrous aperture within the human body is the Mysterious Pass—the most profound and wondrous mechanism between Heaven and Earth. The vast emptiness of Heaven and Earth and the small emptiness of the human body communicate ceaselessly through these gates. Their configuration is as follows:

Here, the scholar establishes the furnace and crucible, each with its own sequence. First, turning the light inward and observing within, from movement to stillness, until stillness is perfected and the Great Ultimate furnace is founded. Next, entering the primordial chaos, returning to emptiness, until emptiness is absolute and the Great Emptiness crucible manifests—thus is the work of establishing furnace and crucible complete.

Wu Chongxu said: "The crucible is no crucible; the furnace is no jade furnace." Crucible and furnace are originally formless, yet from ancient times to the present, how many have erred in their understanding of these two! Here, I reveal their truth—those with discerning eyes will know where to begin.

In the Primordial Eight Trigrams, *qian* is south and *kun* north, *li* east and *kan* west. South above and north below, Heaven and Earth assume their positions; east left and west right, the sun and moon move in their courses. Yin and yang maintain their constancy, hardness and softness correspond, and creation is accomplished. The *qian*-origin initiates, *qian* faces south and acts not; the *kun*-origin engenders, quietly following and upholding Heaven’s virtue. The sun rises in the east, the moon sets in the west, revolving and turning to generate the images of creation.

Heaven and Earth act not, yet the sun and moon act; the sage observes the sun and moon’s movements and knows the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth. Confucius said: "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the hundred creatures are born." Thus, the generative transformation of Heaven and Earth is unseen, while the revolving wheel of the sun and moon is visible. This is why in the Acquired Eight Trigrams, *kan* and *li* occupy the proper positions of south and north, while *qian* and *kun* are relegated to disuse—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth as body, the sun and moon as function.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "*Kan* and *li* frame the void, turning the hub and axle. The four trigrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipes." This speaks of the function of the sun and moon. The gates of Heaven and Earth remain unmoving, while the sun and moon revolve within the emptiness. A single *qi* circulates: in the small, through day and night, waxing and waning; in the greater, through spring and autumn, cold and heat; in the greatest, through cosmic eras and kalpas, spanning ten thousand eons without losing its order. Waxing and waning, growth and decline arise purely of themselves, without a ruler—yet the emptiness truly governs, hence it is called "numinous emptiness," commonly likened to a bellows.

The pipe is the empty box; the bellows, the device that draws and pushes air within. One draw and *qi* issues forth; one push and *qi* enters. One exhalation, one inhalation, and the *qi* fans the fire. When exhalation and inhalation are harmonized, the fire in the furnace blazes upward, neither scorching nor extinguishing. The smith relies on this fire to refine metal.

The sun and moon in space are the breath of Heaven and Earth, their *qi*-mechanism rising and falling naturally in balance—are they not the bellows and pipes? They are the emptiness between Heaven and Earth. The circulation of *qi* occurs within this emptiness.

The flourishing and withering of the myriad things likewise occur within this emptiness. Is it not the power of this emptiness that harmonizes this measure? Above the heavens and below the earth, the sun rises in the east and the moon sets in the west—up and down are like gates, left and right are like the encompassing frame. Are they not the bellows and pipes of the smith? And the sun and moon in their courses, with each waning and each breath, are they not the bellows and pipes opening and closing freely? Thus it is said: *"Empty yet never full, in motion it ever produces."*

Heaven and Earth establish the positions of high and low; Kan and Li array the left and right frames. The four trigrams, one female and one male, provide the resources for generation and inception, establishing the foundation of the myriad transformations. Wei Boyang’s *"encompassing frame"* describes the workings of creation within the emptiness—its profundity is most wondrous.

The human body is a small heaven and earth. At the moment of receiving *qi*, it responds to the Great Emptiness and is endowed with nature—this is *"forming images in heaven."* Through the Supreme Ultimate, it establishes destiny—this is *"forming shapes on earth."* Once the bodily form is complete, it emerges with the sun and enters with the moon, using them for breath. The sun and moon in their courses complete one revolution of 365 degrees, while the rising and falling of yin and yang occur 135,000 times. The breaths of all living people in a day and night likewise number 13,500. The sun and moon’s progression makes one revolution in a year; a person’s breathing makes one revolution in a day and night. The twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two seasonal markers correspond to the meridians and joints of the human body, to the breaths of exhalation and inhalation, and at all times communicate with the Great Emptiness of heaven and earth. Qian and Kun, Kan and Li are already complete within the human body. To know why gates and frames are gates and frames is to find the Dao within them.

*The Canticle* further states: *"Covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang is like a craftsman driving a chariot—following the inked line, holding the reins and bit, aligning the compass and square, tracking the wheel-ruts, abiding in the center to govern the exterior. The reckoning lies in the pitch-pipes and calendar."* This elaborates on the waxing and waning of the one yin and one yang, the functions of the Kan and Li *qi*. The covering descent and veiling ascent correspond to the hexagrams *Fu* and *Gou*, and are verified in the twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two seasonal markers. Thus Confucius said: *"In* Fu *is seen the heart of heaven and earth!"* (See *The Book of Changes*, *Fu* hexagram.) And in the *Qian* hexagram’s nine in the third place, he said: *"All day long* Qian *is* Qian*, returning and repeating the Dao."* For this is verified in the movement and stillness of the *qi*-mechanism, extended even to a full year. The rise of calendrical reckoning takes its model from this.

The metaphor of *"driving"* comes from Laozi’s *"Thirty spokes share one hub"*—the hub is the empty cavity of the revolving axle. The cart moves by its wheels, the wheels are threaded by the axle, and what enables the axle to thread them as one is the emptiness at the hub’s center. Without this emptiness, the cart cannot move. Even with wheel-ruts, what use are they? *The Canticle* takes the axle as the norm, while the operation lies in the hub, hence it says *"abiding in the center to govern the exterior."* This is like the sun and moon revolving within the emptiness to complete the four seasons.

All things have a center; the center is the norm, meaning it is without bias. Among tangible things, none is so centered as to be without bias. Only the emptiness within things is unbiased, without exterior. Great as the empty valleys of heaven and earth, small as the hollow receptacles of the myriad things—all are centers. And within this emptiness, the ten thousand beings are truly conceived. The sages of the Three Teachings all speak of the center. The cauldron of the Great Emptiness is the center; the furnace of the Supreme Ultimate is also the center. The human center communicates with the center of heaven and earth, thus one can steal the spirit-*qi* of heaven and earth to make it one’s own spirit-*qi*. The center of heaven, earth, and the myriad things communicates with the human center, thus it can steal the human spirit-*qi* and subject it to birth, aging, sickness, and death.

Each person possesses one Supreme Ultimate; each of the myriad things likewise possesses one Supreme Ultimate. If one nurtures it well, a person can stand in the position of heaven and earth, nourish the myriad things, extend it to fill the six directions, or roll it up and withdraw it into secrecy. Thus Mencius said: *"The ten thousand things are all complete within me!"* (See *Mencius*, *"Exhausting the Mind," Part One*.) The Supreme Ultimate is one and numinous. Zisi said: *"As a thing, it is not two, thus its generation of things is unfathomable."* (See *The Doctrine of the Mean*.) What, then, is this thing whose generation is unfathomable? It is the Supreme Ultimate, solitary and without peer.

The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes are yin and yang, *qi* and breath. From the Two Modes, transformation proceeds—from the Two Modes to the Four Images and Eight Trigrams, and on to the myriad billions, all are called *"numbers."* Numbers fundamentally begin with the opposition of yin and yang. When heaven and earth divide, numbers arise. Thus *The Book of Changes* says: *"Three for heaven, two for earth, and the numbers are established."* The sun and moon in their courses, for a thousand autumns and ten thousand eons, do not deviate from their sequence. The two *qi* of yin and yang, in their waxing and waning, do not miss their seasonal markers. This is because numbers constrain them—hence the reckoning of calendars and pitch-pipes.

Only the prior-heaven Supreme Ultimate transcends numbers and is the beginning of heaven and earth. The posterior-heaven Supreme Ultimate (the center of heaven and earth) likewise transcends numbers and is the mother of the myriad things. The *"named"* Supreme Ultimate returns to the *"nameless"* Supreme Ultimate—this is called *"embracing simplicity and returning to the real,"* this is called *"returning to the root and recovering destiny."* This is why the Dao is the Dao, and why the wondrous apertures are cultivated in tandem.

The *Alchemical Classics* say: *"Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center."* *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *"This aperture is no ordinary aperture—it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun."*

The *"Spirit-Qi Cavern"* is named thus, for within it lies the essence of Kan and Li. Bai Yuchan said: *"The Mysterious Pass is the true center."* This so-called *"Mysterious Pass"* is yin-yang, the crucible and furnace—it is also the Great Void and the Supreme Ultimate of the prior diagram. Where the Mysterious Female unites, there lies the true center, there lies the Mysterious Pass.

*Laozi* says: *"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things. Thus, constantly free from desire, one observes its mystery; constantly possessing desire, one observes its manifestations. These two emerge together yet differ in name—they are called the Mysterious. Mysterious and again mysterious, the gateway to all wonders."* Such is the case.

As creation shifts and transforms, it never loses its center. Wondrous being and true emptiness originally stem from one gate. The gate and its encompassing frame establish its wholeness; the empty valley’s transformative generation unfolds its function. How vast is the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate!

**Second Lecture: Cultivating Nature to Prolong Life and Postpone the Appointed Term**
**Receiving Qi at Birth Establishes the Foundation of the Dao**

Those who cultivate the Dao set up the furnace and establish the crucible to refine the true sun and moon. The sun and moon are Kan and Li; when Kan and Li merge, the elixir is formed; when Qian and Kun unite, the Great Elixir is achieved. First, refine essence into qi; next, refine qi into spirit; finally, refine spirit to return to emptiness—this is the return from the Supreme Ultimate to the Ultimateless.

The external medicine completes destiny and returns to the Supreme Ultimate; the internal medicine completes nature and returns to the Ultimateless. *The Canticle* says: *"To cultivate nature, prolong life, and postpone the appointed term."* Prolonging life requires seeking the treasure of destiny; cultivating nature restores its numinous emptiness.

For the human form, the prior-heaven transforms into the posterior-heaven—Qian and Kun transform into Kan and Li. Qian’s single yang sinks into Kan, and Kan’s single yang becomes *"Qian Metal,"* which is also the *"treasure of destiny."* *"Drawing from Kan to fill Li"* means extracting this treasure of destiny from Kan and returning it to Li. Li’s single yin then reverts to Kan’s middle line, restoring the original body of Qian and Kun, and the work of destiny is complete.

To clarify this principle, one must first explain the sequence of creation’s generation and the order of human conception and birth. Here is a detailed account:

Creation proceeds from the Supreme Ultimate to the Great Initial, from the Great Initial to the Great Commencement, from the Great Commencement to the Great Simplicity, and from the Great Simplicity to the Great Prime. The Great Commencement is the beginning of qi; the Great Simplicity is the beginning of form; the Great Prime is the beginning of substance.

Image is light, light pertains to fire, and the beginning of image is yang fire. Qi contains moisture, moisture is the beginning of water-qi, which is yin water. With a tangible body that changes over time, it becomes the root of ceaseless generation—thus, the beginning of form is wood. With a solid body that does not change, it becomes firm and unyielding metal—thus, the beginning of substance is metal. With these four—fire, water, wood, and metal—the Five Phases are established, their origin a single undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate.

The Supreme Ultimate’s true emptiness gives rise to wondrous being, and thus the foundation of heaven and earth is laid. Master Tan said: *"Kneading emptiness into clods, one sees the clods but not the emptiness; crushing clods into emptiness, one sees the emptiness but not the clods."* True emptiness and wondrous being emerge together yet differ in name. Within the center is the One, and within the One is the center. This is why it is called the Supreme Ultimate.

The beginning of human life follows the same pattern. From nothing comes being, from the Supreme Ultimate arise the Five Phases, and the embryo takes shape, limbs form—all in accord with the workings of cosmic creation. Before birth, nothing exists; this is the utmost emptiness, the Ultimateless. Daoist scriptures and Buddhist texts speak of *"the original face before parents were born"*—this is precisely it. The *"original face at the time of parents’ birth"* is the Supreme Ultimate.

For when a person is first conceived, the union of the father’s and mother’s essences stirs the prior-heaven qi, which comes from the formless and forms the embryo. At the moment of union, as desire stirs, the physical bodies unite, gradually leading to the union of their spirits. Through the action of their limbs, pleasure arises, and when pleasure reaches its peak, the minds of both man and woman become empty and hollow—even pleasure itself is unperceived, achieving true emptiness. The tangible act of union transforms into the intangible image of pure Kun. Kun is true yin, and only true yin can summon true yang. Thus, it stirs the prior-heaven qi within the Supreme Ultimate, circulating through the six directions, generating being from nothing. A single point of true yang, riding the emptiness, enters the mother’s womb, beginning the gestation. This point of true yang is the heavenly nature of destiny. In heaven, it is nature; in humans, when received at the start of gestation, it is called destiny.

For when man and woman, through pleasure, empty their bodies and minds, they first achieve the Ultimateless. Then, as their spirits and qi merge into one, they become a chaotic Supreme Ultimate, and true emptiness gives rise to a point of wondrous being—principle and qi. From the perspective of the Supreme Ultimate, this is *"being born from nothing"*; from the perspective of the human body, it is *"resonance in response to summoning."* This qi is originally empty, becoming the first qi a person receives—thus, it is called the *"prior-heaven of prior-heaven Qian’s true nature."*

Yet when this qi emerges from the formless, the spirits of the man and woman have already merged into an intangible whole. This point of yang qi enters within, resembling the image of (甲)○. The inner empty circle is this qi’s outer emptiness, symbolizing the union of spirits.

Once the spirits have merged, the breaths of the man and woman also intermingle, producing a tangible sphere of qi, resembling the image of (乙)○, concealed between the yin heel vessels. The (甲) image, drawn by the (乙) image, then enters and unites within it, forming the image of (丙)　, which follows the breath into the womb. This qi is the true mandate of Kun’s primordial power, thus called the *"prior-heaven within posterior-heaven."*

When united as (丙), nature and mandate become one, and only then do the father’s essence and mother’s blood envelop it externally, forming the primal embryo. Together, these constitute five layers of creation, which, when distinguished, are the Supreme Ultimate, the Great Beginning, the Great Inception, the Great Simplicity, and the Great Pristine. As depicted in the (丁) image:

- **甲** is the *"prior-heaven’s singular qi"*—Qian’s true nature—*"prior-heaven of prior-heaven."*
- **乙** is the *"harmony of the parents’ spirits and emotions"*—the nature of qi and material—*"prior-heaven."*
- **丙** is the *"qi born from the parents’ Kan and Li congealment"*—Kun’s true mandate—*"prior-heaven within posterior-heaven."*
- **丁** is the *"father’s essence"*—posterior-heaven.
- **戊** is the *"mother’s blood"*—posterior-heaven.

*(Note: The dashed lines represent emptiness, forming three encompassing layers that numerically align with the Five Phases.)*

The *Book of Changes* states: *"In heaven, it forms images; on earth, it takes shape."* (See *Xici I.*) Following the Dao to generate human life likewise accords with the creative workings of heaven and earth. **甲** and **乙** are both prior-heaven, possessing only images and thus derived from heaven; **丙** and **丁** are posterior-heaven, possessing form and substance and thus derived from earth.

Once the primal embryo is established, that which is received from heaven governs movement and stillness, while that received from earth clings to the prior-heaven to transform the physical form. When the Dao of the formless and the formed is complete, it renews day by day and month by month, gradually accumulating into the five viscera, six bowels, hundred bones, and nine palaces, forming the entire body.

After the placenta is fully formed, the umbilical cord connects to the mother’s breath, serving as the fetus’s respiration and absorbing external qi—this is posterior-heaven qi. This posterior-heaven qi enters the abdomen, lingering with the prior-heaven qi and the prior-heaven within posterior-heaven qi, *"forming images in heaven"*; it nourishes the prior-heaven within posterior-heaven qi and the posterior-heaven qi, *"taking shape on earth,"* silently fostering growth and developing the fetus. Such is the sequential process of human formation and embryonic structuring within the womb.

When the posterior-heaven qi is sufficient and the ten-month gestation is complete, movement reaches its extreme. At this extremity, it becomes exhausted; exhaustion gives rise to spiritual transformation, transformation leads to change, and suddenly, awareness emerges. Breaking through the placenta, the child is born—this occurs because the intermediate existence enters to take dominion, and the spirit and qi are now complete.

What is this intermediate existence? Commonly called the *"soul,"* in Daoism it is termed *"original essence,"* said to carry emotions and consciousness, also called *"conscious nature."* In Buddhism, it is called *"intermediate existence"* (Skt. *antarābhava*), said to bear the karmic roots from beginningless kalpas. Confucianism names it the *"human heart,"* containing the nature of food and desire. When it attaches to the human body, it becomes the spirit-soul; when it mingles with worldly emotions, it becomes the consciousness-spirit; when it drifts in emptiness, it is the intermediate existence. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* translates it as *"intermediate existence,"* perhaps because it is a purely yin, formless, and empty entity. Commonly, it is simply called the *"soul,"* though this is not entirely accurate. For *"soul"* is spoken of in contrast to *"corporeal soul"*—only when this entity enters the human body does the clear and numinous become the soul, while the turbid and coarse become the corporeal soul. At this stage, without a corporeal soul, how can there be a soul?

Moreover, Confucian texts say that when a person dies, the soul returns to heaven and the corporeal soul returns to earth, seemingly equating the soul with nature. There is also the saying of the *"three souls,"* which appears to refer to: one as the indestructible nature, another as this destructible intermediate existence, and a third as the ghostly soul that receives karmic retribution in hell. Later writers, carelessly blending the terminology of the Three Teachings, have made distinctions difficult to clarify, and as it is irrelevant to the Dao, there is no need to explain further.

Human heavenly nature is fundamentally empty and originally without birth or death. Daoism says, *"Each person is complete, each is perfectly realized"*; the *Heart Sūtra* states, *"Neither born nor destroyed, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing"*; Confucianism calls it *"the Dao-heart, only subtle"*—all refer to this.

Yet the conscious nature is subject to birth and death. Thus, Buddhism takes *"transforming consciousness into wisdom"* as the Dao, while the Mysterious School takes *"refining the soul and corporeal soul, transmuting the consciousness-spirit"* as the Dao. The intermediate existence’s cycle of rebirth appears indestructible only because it carries the karmic roots and emotional consciousness from past kalpas. Without this, a person would perish at death—how could they be reborn?

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *"The intermediate existence, without a master, drifts in emptiness and, drawn by the fetus’s resonance, attaches to the human body."* The *Clarifying the Obscure in the Kinship of the Three* says: *"When the ten-month gestation is complete, from within pure chaos and emptiness, a point of original essence emerges, entering my central palace of the spirit to become my master."* Thus, the text says: *"The body one receives is fundamentally empty. The original essence spreads like clouds, relying on qi to take its first form."*

For when a man and woman unite in essence, they receive the prior-heaven’s singular, empty qi to begin the embryo. Upon birth, they again receive the posterior-heaven’s numinous, empty qi to become a person. When the ten months are fulfilled, the posterior-heaven qi transmitted through the umbilical cord fills the fetal body, stirring the true emptiness. Within the stillness of the central palace, it suddenly resonates—this is the pure yang summoning its kindred pure yin. This pure yin intermediate existence, drifting in emptiness, upon receiving this resonance, is drawn like a magnet to iron or two electric charges attracting each other. In an instant, it attaches to the fetal body, entering directly into the central yellow spirit-chamber to become the master of this body.

Once the intermediate existence of pure yin enters, awareness immediately arises. This awareness governs qi and blood, extending to the limbs, and the hands and feet begin to move—just as one stretches upon waking from a deep dream, or like a boulder tumbling from a mountain, startling into sudden motion. At once, the hands part, the feet kick free of the fetal sac, and with the feet now unsupported, the body loses its balance, flipping head over heels to breach the birth canal. Thus the head emerges first, called "inversion at birth."

Yet while the fetus’s awareness arises from the attachment of the intermediate existence, that existence itself does not fully awaken upon entering the body. When drifting in emptiness, it remains in a state of undifferentiated chaos; without the intermediate existence, the fetus too remains unknowing. Only when the intermediate existence relies upon the body, uniting with the prior-heaven qi within posterior-heaven qi, does awareness awaken. And only when stirred by the breath of posterior-heaven qi does this awareness become functional. The three—intermediate existence, prior-heaven qi, and posterior-heaven qi—must converge to achieve animation; separated, they revert to nothingness. Thus, when a person nears death, the primordial qi (the *bing* qi) within the body is exhausted, and posterior-heaven breath ceases. With breath severed, the intermediate existence departs the corporeal shell, drifting away without trace. Daoist texts state, "A person does not die until the last fraction of yang qi is spent"—this is the principle.

The above describes events in the fetal body, while within it, the inner nature and life-force separate at this moment. To elaborate: at conception, the prior-heaven *qi* of *Qian*’s origin constitutes one’s nature, while the prior-heaven *qi* of *Kun*’s origin within posterior-heaven forms one’s life-force. As shown in the earlier diagram, nature and life-force, originally merged, jointly govern the formless creation, bound together by the breath transmitted through the umbilical cord, thus coalescing without dispersion. They further employ the father’s essence and mother’s blood to transform into the corporeal limbs, completing their formation by the seventh month. At completion, the fetus sits within the womb, legs folded with heels touching, pressing tightly against the "Yin Heel" aperture. As Zhang Ziyang’s *Eight Vessel Classic* states: "The Yin Heel vessel lies below the scrotum, above the anus, precisely in the *Xun* trigram’s domain between the thighs." The feet correspond to the *Zhen* trigram, and *Zhen* and *Xun* together form the union of eldest son and eldest daughter. The fetus’s hands clasp each other, sealing the apertures of nose and mouth, preventing breath through them and necessitating respiration via the navel. This is why the hands serve as the "gate of total retention," the human barrier. The hands correspond to the *Gen* trigram, and the mouth to *Dui*, forming the union of youngest son and youngest daughter. The eyes do not gaze outward, the ears do not hear outward—this mirrors the union of middle son and middle daughter within *Kan* and *Li*. The navel’s opening and closing, with qi ascending to the crown, and the crown’s rising and falling, embody the union of *Qian* and *Kun*, yin and yang. Such is the harmonious alignment of the prior-heaven eight trigrams, described here in external terms.

As for the internal, the nature of *Qian* and the life-force of *Kun* reside together in the central palace, merging into the Supreme Polarity’s form. By the tenth month, posterior-heaven qi is full, stirring the central palace, and from the void of the Supreme Polarity, existence arises—stimulated, it connects. The Supreme Polarity is one, posterior-heaven qi is two. One *qi* and two *qi* blend into a misty union, generating the third and producing primordial essence, splitting the primordial chaos. Though the intermediate existence enters from without, its attachment is a response; from the Supreme Polarity’s perspective, it is birth—such is the principle. As the intermediate existence enters, drawn by the misty union of the two *qi*, it is absorbed directly into the central palace, relying upon the midst of the three *qi*, and thus gains awareness. With this awareness’s first stir, heaven and earth invert, and the central palace—where my nature and life-force unite—is jolted awake, as if clouds parting to reveal the sun, suddenly radiant. Clear qi ascends, and the nature of *Qian*’s primordial yang *qi* is driven to the crown, entering the empty valley of the *Niwan* palace; turbid qi descends, and the life-force of *Kun*’s true *qi* settles into the empty cavity of the Life Gate between the kidneys, splitting the Supreme Polarity into the Two Modes.

Thereafter, the intermediate existence, a strong guest seizing the host’s place, occupies the spirit-chamber as its master—just as after heaven and earth split, the void between them becomes the repository for the generation of the myriad things. In symbolic terms, the intermediate existence, born of the union of *Qian* and *Kun*, is naturally the child of nature and life-force, and as the child inherits the father’s body, it assumes governance. Yet the intermediate existence inherently carries emotion and perception, along with the karmic roots of past lives, opening my six senses and entangling my nature and life-force—thus becoming a thief. Hence both Buddhist and Daoist traditions employ the metaphor of "mistaking the thief for one’s child."

Once the intermediate existence becomes the master of the posterior-heaven form, awareness functions through qi, and qi moves through awareness, cycling in mutual activation, opening the six gates. Yet at the moment of its first stir, birth occurs. Within the womb, the fetus shares the mother’s breath. Upon emerging, the hands part, revealing the apertures for respiration. The true yang of *Qian*’s origin resides in the Celestial Valley, and with yang summoning yin, posterior-heaven air rushes in through the nose, first filling the mouth—hence the newborn’s first cry. The umbilical cord is severed, and the true *qi* of *Kun*’s origin retreats into the Life Gate, deeply concealed. The fetal breath below the navel ceases, unable to sustain itself, and thus the infant suddenly feels hunger and can eat.

From this point onward, with every inhalation and exhalation, the intermediate existence lingers, further awakening awareness. With every sip and bite, the physical form is nourished, yet innate wisdom is obscured. The milk and water of the human world are laden with worldly passions; the consciousness of discriminating mind takes control, and the Dao-heart gradually dims. Thus, there are those in the world who can speak at birth and recall past causes, yet after drinking milk, all becomes vague. The common saying of "the soup of forgetfulness" refers precisely to the milk and water of this world. At birth, there is none who does not retain some knowledge of past lives. This is why moments of "sincere foreknowledge" often occur after severing ties with worldly sustenance.

Moreover, the intermediate existence enters and resides in the Central Palace, where it is numinous and aware, serving as the master within. The precelestial Five Agents within the body are thereby established, their configuration as follows:

These five are all formless, hence precelestial. Their distinction lies in the interplay of movement and stillness: Original Nature is the primordial ancestral nature; when still, it is fundamentally an empty body, yet when moved, it becomes numinous and is called Original Spirit. Original Emotion is inherited from the parents at conception, transformed and united with the intermediate existence to form it; thus, when still, it is the fundamental substance, and when moved, it is termed Original Essence. As for Original Qi, it is the root of human life; Original Nature, Original Spirit, and Original Essence all depend on Original Qi to move, making it the true master of the precelestial, residing at the center to govern all.

Humans possess two aspects: *hun* and *po*. The *hun* is the shadow of spirit and qi; when still, it is formless, yet when moved, it takes shape. The *po* is the surplus of essence and qi; when still, it has form, and when moved, it acquires substance. The *hun* is pure and favors stillness; in stillness, it connects with the numinous. The *po* is turbid and favors movement; in movement, it indulges in desire. Thus, there is the division of yang-*hun* and yin-*po*, both manipulated by the discriminating mind. After death, the *hun* scatters to repay past karmic debts, while the *po* remains to guard the corpse. As the Buddhist scriptures say, "Those who enjoy offerings and harm people are all the work of the *po*."

When the intermediate existence enters the womb, the fetal sac becomes numinous and aware—without entering the womb, the intermediate existence lacks spirit, and without uniting with the intermediate existence, the fetal sac remains inert. The transformations of the posterior-heaven depend on the intermediate existence, which in turn relies on posterior-heaven qi as its support; only upon union can movement occur. This is the Original Emotion of the fetus, which, when moved, descends to earth, letting out a sudden wail. The Primordial Chaos is split open, and the infant’s sorrowful cries cease not. As *The Collection of Central Harmony* states, "A single sword cleaves the chaos; two hands rend the Primordial Void."

From this point onward, the discriminating mind takes control, and the precelestial Five Agents transform into the posterior-heaven essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent. Their configuration is as follows:

Here, they are divided into five—essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent—without mention of qi. This is because qi enters intent, and intent is qi; thus, qi is not spoken of, but intent is. In truth, none of the five can move without qi. If intent is set aside and qi is emphasized, calling them essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and qi would also be acceptable.

The discriminating mind brings harm, causing us to abandon principle and follow desire, to commit wrongs and evil—all for this reason. Cultivators must construct a fortress to restrain it, keeping it still at the center so it does no harm. This is indeed a necessary task for those who practice the Dao, as the *Canon* says, "Manage and nurture the protective barriers, congeal the spirit to form the body."

As for qi, it is the beginning and end of all things. To cultivate nature, one must first cultivate qi; only by cultivating qi can life be preserved. Qi is the source of the five. At the time of utter nothingness, only qi arises first, and at the moment of attaining the Dao, it truly relies on qi. Qi is metal; only the metal of *Qian* can complete both beginning and end, which is why all alchemical scriptures speak of metal.

The so-called essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent—essence is the essence of intercourse, spirit is the spirit of thought, and intent is the intent of deluded movement, all masters of posterior-heaven emotions and desires. From this, root and dust interact, causing the fall from the original precelestial nature, while our pure, luminous, and perfect nature is obscured and vanishes without a trace. Yet in infancy, one can still preserve innate purity; once the body is broken, deliverance becomes ever more difficult.

The scripture asks, "What is the 'Yellow Path of 5,400 births'?" From the day of birth to the 5,480th day, the qi of *Qian*-metal is full, and the body is suffused with yang—this is the state of pure yang. Those of superior virtue and childlike purity, if they cultivate from this day, need not employ the work of return; they may simply sit in noble inaction. For if the vessel is unbroken, what need is there for repair? At this time of full qi, what use is there for methods of accumulating yang? Directly employing the work of refining qi into spirit is sufficient. For women, this period is 5,048 days, about a year shorter than for men, constituting a state of pure yin. Women of superior virtue, if they cultivate at this time of fullness, find it as easy as men.

Lu Ziye said, "At sixteen, a boy’s essence flows; at fourteen, a girl’s menses arrive." This is what the *Awakening to Reality* calls "the White Tiger’s first menstruation, a supreme treasure." The day when flow is about to begin but has not yet, when arrival is imminent but not yet come—this is the pure state of *Qian* and *Kun*. One day past this, the body is broken. The male is of the *Qian* body, which, when broken, becomes *Li*; the female is of the *Kun* body, which, when broken, becomes *Kan*. In men, *Kun* interacts with *Qian*, the yang line of *Qian* entering the yin hexagram, transforming *Kun* into *Kan*. True qi descends from behind the brain, passing through the spine to enter the cavity between the two kidneys, where yin and yang unite and essence is born.

In women, *Qian* interacts with *Kun*, the yin line of *Kun* entering the yang hexagram, transforming *Qian* into *Li*. The true qi of the uterus ascends, stirring the cavity between the two breasts, where yin and yang unite and menses arrive. Both arise from the fullness of spirit and qi, giving birth to the third substance—white essence and red menses. If this flow continues without return, it follows the course of human birth, and worldly affairs multiply.

Those who cultivate the Dao, if they wish to return to the root and restore the source, reversing *Li* and *Kan* back into *Qian* and *Kun*, need only employ the method of inverting *Kan* and *Li*. For men, seeking the mysterious within the *Kan* palace means extracting lead from *Kan*—the work of refining the self and laying the foundation—with the Dao residing in the cavity between the two kidneys. For women, cultivating stillness within the *Li* palace means extracting mercury from *Li*—the task of severing the Red Dragon—with the Dao residing in the cavity between the two breasts. Relying on these two cavities, one seeks the yin and yang lines and returns them to their original hexagrams, thus attaining the Dao and completing the work of inversion, restoring the unbroken state of childhood.

The *Pulse Hopes* states: "The orifices of the human body are the apertures of the hexagrams’ lines, forming the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*." For example, the mouth, external genitals, and anus are single orifices, representing the three yang; the eyes, ears, and nose are double orifices, representing the three yin. The three yin and three yang of the human body—yin above and yang below—precisely form the *Earth-Heaven Peace* hexagram. Between heaven and earth lies the Great Ultimate of emptiness, which is called the "center," the place where the *Ren* and *Du* meridians intersect and where spirit and qi converge.

Based on this principle, the external correspondences of the remaining six hexagrams are as follows:

*Kan*: The ears are at the back, hence its position below. As the alchemical texts say, "Seek it in *Kan*," and "Transmit it through mouth and ear."

*Li*: When circulating the Microcosmic Orbit, the true yin of *Kan* ascends from behind and nears the eyes, while the yin fluids of *Li* descend, passing through the *Chonglou* to enter the *Dantian*. This makes it clear.

*Gen*: The *Book of Changes* says, "Stopping at the back, one does not obtain the body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see the person." *Gen* represents the *Du* meridian, rising from the *Weilü* and ending below the nose—an image of walking in the courtyard.

*Dui*: *Dui* is the mouth. As the alchemical texts say, "The union of *Dui* is not through speech." *Dui* means joy, the place where spirit and qi enter and exit.

The above pertains to the postnatal state and is used in the ascent and descent of the firing process—these are the outer eight trigrams. The inner eight trigrams correspond to the five viscera and six bowels within the human body, which cultivators of the Dao need not concern themselves with, and thus are noted but not discussed. The great function of the inner trigrams lies in the heart and kidneys, which are the *Kan* and *Li* hexagrams. Their function is taken, not their form, to be elaborated upon later.

Here, we briefly explain the positions of the pre- and postnatal eight trigrams relevant to the firing process. In the prenatal arrangement, *Qian* is south and *Kun* north, *Li* east and *Kan* west. If the four trigrams are interchanged, it becomes the postnatal arrangement, with *Li* south, *Kan* north, *Qian* east, and *Kun* west. The diagram is as follows:

East is on the left, west on the right; the left is the back, the right the abdomen. East ascends and west descends, meaning ascent from the back and descent from the front. Furthermore, the front is the yin side, the back the yang side; yang ascends from *Qian* in the east, while yin descends from *Kun* in the west.

In the postnatal arrangement, *Kun* is also in the southwest. The *Kun* hexagram has six yin lines, hence emptiness is the direction of *Kun*. The *Shuowen* says, "The southwest is called *Ao*." The *Analects* states, "Rather than flatter the *Ao*, better to flatter the stove" (see *Analects*, *Eight Rows of Dancers*). The *Ao* is the empty direction of the southwest—what use is flattery? It is also the *tang’ao* (hall’s inner chamber), where *tang* also means emptiness; it is the *mingtang* (bright hall), where *mingtang* likewise implies emptiness; it is the *xuan’ao* (mysterious chamber), the *shen’ao* (profound chamber), all signifying the abstruse and difficult to know. For *Ao* is the *Kun* direction of the southwest, the direction of emptiness. As the *Awakening to Reality* says, "To know the source of the elixir’s production, it lies only in the southwest, the native place." Alchemical texts often speak of the "*Kun* direction," alluding to the image of something arising from nothing.

In the postnatal arrangement, *Qian* is east and *Kun* west, so *Dui* is west, and the prenatal *Kan* is also west. The position of *Kun* is the same as *Dui*, and the position of *Dui* is the same as *Kan*—*Kun*, *Dui*, and *Kan* are one. In the postnatal arrangement, *Zhen* is east, and the prenatal *Li* is also east. *Qian* is the same as *Zhen*—*Qian*, *Zhen*, and *Li* are one. In the postnatal arrangement, *Kun* is also southwest, and the prenatal *Xun* is southwest. *Xun* is wind, and wind is qi; the qi of empty cavities stirs to become wind, the so-called gate of the great qi’s entry and exit—thus *Xun* is also *Kun*. In the postnatal arrangement, *Qian* retreats to the northwest, so *Gen* is also *Qian*.

The place where the human spirit and qi enter and exit is the *Niwan* Palace in the head. *Niwan* means "a pellet of mud that can be sealed," also called the ancestral aperture. The diagram is as follows:

Within the human head is an emptiness that connects to the various orifices of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and throat. This emptiness and its connected orifices are collectively called the *Niwan*. If distinguished, the upper part is the *Niwan*, and below the *Niwan* is called the *Mingtang*. Further below is the *Honggong* (Crimson Palace), also called the *Xuanying* (Suspended Breast), or *Xuanyong* (Suspended Obstruction). *Xuan* means suspended in emptiness; *ying* refers to the empty cavity above the chest, also called the *qiangzi* (cavity), or *xuwu qiangzi* (cavity of emptiness and nothingness), where *qiangzi* also implies emptiness.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "When one attains a single good, one clings to it tenaciously in the breast." *Clinging tenaciously* signifies the act of *total retention*; *in the breast* means taking the empty space as the gateway of total retention. The character *suspended* in "suspended embryo crucible" likewise denotes *suspended in emptiness*, while the "cinnabar crucible" is so named for its redness. All cavities within the human body are red, and thus what is within the body is metaphorically called not "mercury" but "cinnabar."

The *Canticle* says: "Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and lofty. Flanked by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai and Kunlun; encircled and sealed, its four paths are winding." This describes Penglai and the Jasper Isle, the abodes of immortals. *Majestic and lofty* speaks of its unfathomable depth, echoing the *Doctrine of the Mean*'s "the vastness of Heaven, the abyss of the deep." It is also called *Penglai*, for it depicts the primordial spirit and primordial *qi*'s native realm—supremely exalted, akin to the dwellings of immortals.

The eight vessels and nine apertures are all pervaded by *qi*, all serving as walls and gates, while the ancestral aperture of spirit and *qi* is none other than the *Niwan* Palace, which connects inner and outer. Externally, the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose; internally, the twin apertures of the *Lofty Tower*—all communicate within the emptiness of the *Niwan*. Thus, the diagram shows the interconnectedness of great and small voids. That which links them, forming the mutual exchange of spirit and *qi* between Heaven, Earth, and beings, lies precisely within these nine apertures that open to the outside. If the nine apertures are blocked, one suffocates and dies.

In the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the bodhisattvas' cultivation proceeds through one of the nine apertures, or through earth, water, fire, and wind—truly, the inner and outer voids each possess the body of the Great Ultimate. The various names in the alchemical classics—*Mysterious Gate*, *Female Portal*, *Celestial Valley*, *Responsive Valley*, *Spiritual Valley*—all refer to the empty apertures. Only through emptiness can creation arise, and the void that connects inner and outer is the true center of the Mysterious Female.

The Daoists depict its form thus, and scholars should awaken to this in an instant. Hence, the *Canticle* further states: "It may be free from thought, but not from toil and sorrow. When spirit and *qi* fill the chamber, none can detain them. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies humanity."

**Lecture Three: The Wondrous Luminosity of Inherent Nature is Possessed by All**

The Valley Spirit never dies—it returns to the Great Ultimate. At the inception of the Great Creation, white and black enfold one another like a hen’s egg. The moment of human conception is no different: within is white, without is black, white and black enfolding each other. The white is the *qi* of Prior Heaven, the true void pregnant with wondrous existence; the black is the *qi* of Posterior Heaven that arises after the union of male and female breath, wondrous existence containing the true void. The *Canticle* states: “Within the white dwells the true; square and round, a span in diameter. Intermingled, they restrain each other.” “The white is the essence of metal; the black, the foundation of water.” For the true void is a single *qi*—the essence of metal, white and issuing from *Qian*; it is also the primordial nature of *Qian*, what is called the “root of nature.” The wondrous existence is a single *qi*—the essence of water, black and issuing from *Kun*, what is called the “stem of life” of *Kun*. The white originates from Heaven and forms images in Heaven; the black emerges from Earth and takes shape on Earth. White and black enfold each other to form the shape of the Great Ultimate, no larger than a square inch, hence the *Canticle* says “square and round, a span in diameter” to describe the beginning. The inception of the embryo is no more than this.

The *Book of Changes* states: “Great indeed is the primal *qi* of *Qian*; all things owe their beginning to it” (*Qian* hexagram); “Supreme indeed is the primal *qi* of *Kun*; all things owe their birth to it” (*Kun* hexagram). The “beginning” is that first point of true yang that gives rise to the Four Images and Five Phases. The “beginning” is in Heaven, while the “birth” is on Earth—yet this is merely their image, for in truth, all lies within a single aperture. The white is the true void; the black, wondrous existence. The *Analects* says: “In painting, the plain ground precedes the colors” (*Eight Rows*). The white is the plain ground, and only the white can receive colors. The classic states: “From the One comes the Two; from the Two comes the Three; from the Three come the ten thousand things.” At the inception of human life, the *qi* of Prior Heaven is the One; the breath of father and mother is the Two. When One and Two unite to form Three, the *qi* of Prior Heaven and the *qi* of Prior Heaven within Posterior Heaven combine, and from nothing comes something—a third entity, which is the intermediate *yin*. For after conception, the umbilical cord connects to the mother’s body, and the fetus adopts the mother’s breath as its own, drawing in the external *qi* of Posterior Heaven. This *qi* of Posterior Heaven lingers with the *qi* of Prior Heaven and the *qi* of Prior Heaven within Posterior Heaven, causing the daily growth and flourishing of the form. When the form is complete, by the principle of resonance among like things, the intermediate *yin* is summoned from without—is this not the Three arising from One and Two?

Applying the theory of the Three Powers: the *qi* of Prior Heaven is Heaven; the mingled breath of father and mother is Earth; this intermediate *yin* is Man—thus the Three Powers. With the addition of the father’s essence and mother’s blood, the Five Forms are complete. Once the intermediate *yin* arrives and resides in the Yellow Spirit Chamber as the master within, the quiescent embryo stirs and moves in response. Before the intermediate *yin* enters the womb, it is without knowledge or perception, drifting through empty space; upon entering the womb, it becomes sentient and aware, for the womb contains *qi*, and the intermediate *yin* relies on it to gain consciousness. Thus, it breaks through the primordial chaos, and the infant is born.

The root of nature in Prior Heaven is *Qian*, which is Heaven; that which originates from Heaven ascends, hence it floats to the crown. The *qi* of Prior Heaven within Posterior Heaven is life, and the stem of life is *Kun*, which is Earth; that which originates from Earth descends, thus it sinks and settles into the Gate of Life. The Great Ultimate transforms into *Qian* and *Kun*. The nature that floats to the crown is “existence within non-existence”; the life that sinks into the Gate of Life is “non-existence within existence.” The Gate of Life is also called the “Secret Portal” or the “Northern Culmen Abyss.” Once nature and life are established and inner and outer communicate, the infant can eat, speak, move, see, and hear.

The above describes the principles governing the fetus’s birth and its stages as infant, baby, young child, and youth. Upon the breaking of the body, the situation shifts from Prior Heaven to Posterior Heaven: *Li* and *Kan* replace *Qian* and *Kun*, occupying south and north, while *Qian* and *Kun* are arrayed east and west. The four trigrams form a surrounding enclosure, and the central Spirit Chamber lies empty and at rest. Only the intermediate *yin* assumes its proper position and function, but with the opposition of root and dust, knowledge unfolds daily, and the intermediate *yin* transforms into the consciousness-spirit, increasingly harming nature and life.

When the body breaks, true *yin* ascends and true yang descends; nature turns into emotion, and emotion turns into nature. The *qi* of Prior Heaven—its material form, desires, and appetites—combines with the *qi* of material form, desires, and appetites carried by the intermediate *yin* through countless kalpas. Thus, the heart grows ever more restless, and worldly desires multiply. Once generative essence arises, the child’s body naturally breaks—this need not await the union of male and female, for the breaking of the body is the natural work of Heaven and Earth. On the day when “five thousand four hundred births complete the Yellow Path,” pure yang and pure *yin* reach their fullness. After this day, the body breaks of itself: in males, generative essence is produced; in females, the water of celestial menses appears. One white, one red—precisely one *Kan* and one *Li*, the image of external leakage.

At the inception of the Yellow Path, the spirit is radiant, the countenance luminous. In males, a warm *qi* often courses through the spine; in females, a cool fluid often flows beneath the breasts. Those who attend to bodily experience will know this. If one cultivates at this stage, what flows is original *qi* and original essence. Simply concentrate the spirit in the *qi* cavity, and it will generate endlessly. Within non-action, the fire of the microcosmic orbit circulates naturally. Empty the heart, and the abdomen will fill of itself; illuminate the heart, and nature will manifest of itself.

Without contrivance or effort, the elixir forms in the realm of unknowing and unawareness—most simple, most easy. Yet once the body is broken, true yang has already dispersed; without the work of accumulation, one cannot return to youth and lay the foundation for cultivation.

Here follows the principle of the broken body: On the five thousand four hundredth day of the Yellow Path’s generation, yin and yang conjoin and the body is broken. At that time, the original *qi* of the Gate of Life (the life within *Kun*) surges upward along the spine to meet the ancestral *qi* at the crown (the single yin within *Li*). The ancestral *qi* in the crown descends through the Crimson Palace straight into the Gate of Life, where it merges with the original *qi* of the Gate. This is *Kun* yin ascending into *Qian*, *Qian* yang sinking into *Kun*—yin and yang inverted, *Qian* hollowed into *Li*, *Kun* solidified into *Kan*. The original *qi* once present in the Gate of Life is pressed downward into the space between the Gate and the yin heel vessel, where it borders the void outside the body, as if external—hence the alchemical classics speak of it as “fathomlessly deep.”

Once heaven and earth have conjoined, the yin of *Li* becomes hollow and restless, ever drifting outward. A single spark of original emotion courses through the central palace’s spirit chamber, stirring the acquired emotions and perceptions. These rise to the crown, where they merge with the nature within *Li*, arousing desire. Descending again to the Gate of Life, they generate tangible essence. Nature and emotion blend, the original spirit transforms into the acquired spirit, and the postcelestial entirely takes charge under the rule of the acquired spirit.

The domain of the original spirit is occupied by the acquired spirit, squeezed out from the lesser void to dwell between inner and outer. Its condition mirrors that of the life within the original *qi*—pressed outward, as if external—thus the Daoist texts often speak of “seeking without.” This is why Sun Wukong in *Journey to the West* is called “External Grandfather.”

When lust and desire flourish and the six senses rage unchecked, the original spirit becomes as if nonexistent—like the sun obscured by clouds, where only clouds are seen and not the sun. In unbroken children, the original spirit still resides: though the acquired spirit governs their actions, in moments of stillness, the unknowing original spirit remains whole within, a pure innocence ever manifest. But once the original spirit is consumed by the acquired spirit, the world becomes one of the acquired spirit alone. For those with deep-rooted vitality, the original spirit may yet persist at times. If one carries karmic roots from the intermediate state, and if one cultivated the Dao in past lives, those root-nature remain, and the original spirit may endure to some degree. But if what one brings are only karmic obstructions, the original spirit is entirely absent, leaving only karmic consciousness.

Those with wisdom roots possess the original spirit; those without are wholly acquired spirit—such is the principle. There is also a special case: Confucius said, “Only the highest wisdom and the lowest stupidity cannot be changed.” The highest wisdom refers to those with wisdom roots, as described above. As for the lowest stupidity, not only do they lack wisdom roots, but they also lack intelligence and perception; their acquired spirit is dull, and the original spirit cannot persist even to a small degree—hence they “cannot be changed.”

Ordinary people of middling capacity rely entirely on the acquired spirit for governance. Confucius said, “By nature, people are close; by habit, they grow apart.” Habit and nature become one, deeply ingrained. All day, they are entangled in the seven—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, desire—and submerged in the six—form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas—adrift in the cycle of birth and death until the original spirit is wholly eroded. As Laozi said, “Of ten, three are companions of life; of ten, three are companions of death”—this is what he meant.

The eight trigrams of the child’s body are *Qian* south and *Kun* north, *Li* east and *Kan* west. At the time of the Yellow Path’s generation, the eight trigrams become *Li* south and *Kan* north, *Qian* east and *Kun* west. Now, the eastern and western *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Zhen* and *Dui*. *Zhen* is the eldest son, *Dui* the youngest daughter, replacing their father and mother. The father *Qian* and mother *Kun* retreat into the void of the southwest and northwest, no longer active. Thus, the alchemical classics speak of *Zhen* and *Dui* rather than *Qian* and *Kun*.

After the body is broken, *Li* and *Kan* occupy the upper and lower positions, while *Zhen* and *Dui* stand at the eastern and western gates. Thus, water and fire are unregulated, metal and wood are estranged; what flames upward grows ever more fierce, what flows downward sinks ever lower. Spirit leaks above, and essence and *qi* follow; essence leaks below, and spirit and *qi* follow; *qi* leaks in the center, and essence and spirit follow. What was received from the prenatal is ceaselessly lost, while the postcelestial desires of the world incessantly obscure. With each fraction of yang consumed, yin grows by a fraction. By the time a woman reaches forty-nine (seven sevens) and a man sixty-four (eight eights), true yang is exhausted. If one harms it excessively, it may be depleted before this time; if one preserves it well, it may endure beyond—all depends on the sway of worldly desires.

The rustic folk of the countryside often enjoy their full span of years, while those of wealth and nobility frequently suffer from illness—this is the reason. When the human body resides in the womb, it is called the prenatal; before receiving *qi*, it is the prenatal of the prenatal. Upon birth, it becomes the postnatal; after the body is broken open, it becomes the postnatal of the postnatal, also known as the body of postnatal turbid yin.

The prenatal exists before heaven and earth, and is the Supreme Ultimate. The prenatal of the prenatal is the Non-Ultimate. The Non-Ultimate is the extremity of nothingness, the utmost of emptiness. Before a person’s parents unite, there is not the slightest sign of existence—this is the Non-Ultimate. After death, when the form is extinguished and the nature returns to nothingness, it is again the Non-Ultimate. To know death is to know life; if one does not know life, how can one know death? Before birth and after death, all is one emptiness. In between, there is form and appearance, color and substance—merely a few decades. The Buddhist scriptures say, *"What has form must ultimately decay; what is formless is true"*—this means that the body perishes in mere decades, while what is neither born nor destroyed is only the nature of the primordial ancestral *qi*.

But why does this nature not perish? Because its original essence is empty nothingness. Though it moves and awakens, in stillness it is as if never born. Speaking solely of nature, true emptiness is its substance, wondrous existence its function; wondrous existence is numinous awareness. This awareness arises from sensation and moves with *qi*; separated from *qi*, it returns to emptiness, and without sensation, it remains forever void. Precisely because it is utterly nothing, it does not arise or perish—hence the saying, *"Heaven and earth may decay, but this does not."*

How could emptiness ever decay? Thus, it transcends eternal kalpas. Cultivating and nurturing it serves to preserve it; to preserve it is to preserve one’s heavenly mandate. The heavenly mandate is heaven’s numinous radiance, which, at the moment of awareness, enters the mother’s womb. Upon entering the womb, it reverts to the body of true emptiness. From this, form is completed and birth occurs. At every moment, when emptiness and numinosity respond, awareness of the ten thousand existences and thousand realities arises—all things in the three realms can be known, yet none can know it. Later, it is obscured by the intermediate existence and usurped by emotional consciousness.

Though its numinous radiance is dimmed, in moments of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, nothing remains hidden. After death, it returns to its original true emptiness, dwelling motionless within heaven and earth. The Confucian teaching of *"preserving what is received in full and returning it in full"* means precisely preserving the numinosity received at the beginning. To preserve this numinosity, one must undergo a process of refinement, allowing the *qi* of wondrous existence to merge within. Then, in life, one is empty and numinous; in death, one remains empty and numinous—furthermore, expanding its capacity to boundlessness. When released, it pervades the six directions; when concealed, it retreats into profound obscurity—this is preserving what was received and returning it in full.

The Song Confucians, not comprehending the principles of the *Yijing*, believed that fulfilling human affairs constituted *"preserving what is received in full and returning it in full."* They did not realize that emptiness without existence is mere dead emptiness, and voidness without numinosity is not true void. The mandate received at the beginning has already been lost imperceptibly—how can one speak of preserving it in full?

Moreover, the true yang of the prenatal is the principle-*qi* of the Supreme Ultimate, the source from which the ten thousand things are born. Utterly nonbeing yet containing utter being, utterly empty yet truly numinous—sages’ innate knowledge and numinous awareness arise solely from nurturing this *qi*. Though it resides within the human body, it cannot always respond because people cannot remain constantly still; it cannot always be numinous because people cannot remain constantly empty.

The poem of the True Man of Great Mystery says:
*From parents’ birth, a single numinous spark,*
*Yet numinous no more once form takes shape.*
*Form obscures the body of radiant light—*
*Let go, and clarity returns in full.*

The poem of Chan Master Zhi Jue says:
*Bodhisattvas never leave the true,*
*Yet from the start, delusion estranges them.*
*If one can sit in stillness, turning light within,*
*One sees the former master of one’s prior life.*

The poem of Chan Master Miao Xu says:
*Ever wakeful, the master within,*
*Abiding motionless in the numinous palace.*
*If nothing obstructs this inner realm,*
*The natural body is itself empty void.*

The poem of Scholar Zhang Zhuo says:
*Radiant light, still illumination, pervades the Ganges’ sands—*
*Ordinary and sacred, originally one family.*
*When not a single thought arises, the whole body appears;*
*The moment the six senses stir, clouds obscure it.*

For the primordial ancestral *qi* is nature in humans. Once the fetus is formed, it mingles with the *qi*-nature and material nature of the parents, as well as the karmic desires of the intermediate existence, obscuring its clarity and filling its emptiness—thus its numinous radiance is lost. As the *Cantong Qi* says, *"The One is obscured, and the world does not know it."* Yet when attached to form, its emptiness and numinosity are obscured—why then, when speaking of death returning to emptiness and awareness dissolving, is this so?

It is said: The former speaks from the perspective of the self, the latter from the perspective of the other. The self is formed by this *qi*, which is the prenatal master of the self. When the intermediate existence usurps the host as a guest, the original nature’s numinosity is obscured, yet it still resonates with the true emptiness beyond form. Only the prenatal primordial *qi* within the postnatal remains to cling to it, so it does not immediately depart from the body. When ordinary people die, their nature returns to emptiness, reverting to the Supreme Ultimate of heaven and earth. Though it is neither born nor destroyed, for one’s lifetime of awareness and the sufferings of beings in the three realms, it is as if unrelated—like awakening from a great dream, where the former illusions and bubbles are no different from the emptiness before birth.

From the perspective of the self as the subject, there is truly no numinosity or awareness; from the perspective of the other as the subject, it still gestates the ten thousand things.

In reality, the "I" has already perished, yet emptiness remains emptiness—was the primordial *qi* I first received not already dispersed, reduced to nothingness? How then can it be called "wholly returned"? Only by preserving the true self, dissolving the illusory form of the corporeal body while ensuring the formless true self endures, does one become a great person of luminous virtue, or the sage who transcends through transformation, or the spirit beyond comprehension—this is why the Three Teachings emphasize the cultivation of the body.

The Way of cultivating the body begins by drawing that which was the master back to its rightful place, while the "I" retreats to the position of guest. Only then can the "I" be transformed into emptiness and merge with it, so that the "I" that was not numinous becomes numinous, and the "I" that was not empty becomes empty. Abiding in constant stillness yet ceaselessly responsive, like the Most High traversing seven kalpas of primordial chaos to repeatedly expound the Dao, or like Śākyamuni pervading the ten directions and three realms to eternally ferry sentient beings.

The scriptures’ discourse on "that" and "I" arises in three contexts: first, from the standpoint of duality; second, because emptiness is difficult to describe, and so the term "that" is used as a substitute; third, because the "I" is the master of the body, while emptiness is the master of the "I"—both being masters, hence the terms "that" and "I" generally do not exceed these three meanings. Later generations, misunderstanding a single "that," have spawned countless transgressions—what could be more lamentable?

Moreover, Daoist texts sometimes refer to "that household," which carries the meaning of "the other shore," as in the *Journey to the West* verse: *"Prajñā-pāramitā arrives at that household."* Ancient sages, recognizing that people misconstrued the word "that," appended the character "household" to clarify. "Household" here aligns with the *Awakening to Reality* line, *"This supreme treasure is possessed by every household,"* and Zhang Sanfeng’s poem, *"Every household has, every household has."* It is said "every household has" rather than "every person has" because emptiness is humanity’s true home. The colored body is form, a substantial entity; the original nature is formless, emptiness itself. The colored body is nurtured within emptiness, and without emptiness, it cannot live—thus, humanity takes emptiness as its home and the numinous as its sovereign.

The union of emptiness and the numinous is called the "Valley Spirit." "Valley" denotes the hollow cavity, while "Spirit" signifies *"that which is wondrous beyond all things."* The scriptures state: *"Heaven and earth are one great valley; caves are a middle valley; orifices are a small valley."* My master, Perfected Wang, said: *"Extending this to the body, the Valley Spirit governs all: the ears cannot hear without emptiness, the eyes cannot see without emptiness, the nose cannot smell without emptiness, the tongue cannot speak without emptiness, the hands cannot grasp without emptiness, the feet cannot walk without emptiness, and the body and mind cannot be at ease without emptiness—otherwise, illness arises. Moreover, if the mouth and nose cannot breathe, death follows."*

I further extend this reasoning: clothing cannot be worn without hollowness; a dwelling cannot be inhabited without hollowness; the mouth and stomach cannot ingest food and drink without hollowness. All things in the myriad realms occupy space, and within their forms, orifices arise to connect with emptiness, embodying the principle of the *"Three Thieves"* in the *Yin Fu Jing*. Only by emptiness communicating with emptiness can there be numinosity and movement. Without the Valley Spirit’s governance, there can be no emptiness; without emptiness, there can be no numinous communion, and the mechanism of transformation ceases.

The scriptures say: *"The Dao is simply emptiness."* Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng declared: *"Observe me: breath naturally gathers and closes, naturally lifts and raises. Before father and mother were born, that single point of true yang moved and stilled, cultivating roots and nurturing the stem within emptiness, establishing life and securing its foundation within emptiness—this is the primordial tone we speak of, the luminous principle."* He Yangzi said: *"My body came from emptiness; my body should return to emptiness."*

Within emptiness, departure and arrival unfold;
Within emptiness, the tree of karma is sown.
Once the karma-tree’s roots strike deep,
Its branches and boughs choke the paths of coming and going.

Yingchanzi says:
To become immortal, Buddha, or sage—
The three teachings transmit but one emptiness.
From ancient times to now, those who transcend
All cultivate their work within emptiness.
To study immortality: emptiness and stillness are the elixir’s core.
To study Buddhism: abiding in emptiness completes the task.
If you ask how to study the sagely way,
Within emptiness, self dissolves to reveal Heaven’s principle.

The Dao-body’s emptiness is wondrous beyond measure;
Heaven and Earth operate in emptiness, qi harmoniously fused.
Yin and Yang’s transformations surge through emptiness;
Should one abide in emptiness, all becomes malleable.

Master Wei Kuan says:
I urge you to study the Dao, seek not greedily—
With no-mind, all things align with the Dao’s head.
Only no-mind can embody the no-mind Dao;
Embodying no-mind, even the Dao rests.

The *Xingming Guizhi* states:
At the moment parents’ thoughts unite in union,
Round and luminous, radiant and bright,
A single point of primordial luminous light strikes the mother’s womb—
Simply thus: ○.
The Confucians call it “benevolence,” also “Wuji”;
The Buddhists call it “the pearl,” also “luminous clarity”;
The Daoists call it “the elixir,” also “spirit-light.”
All refer to this primordial qi, the primordial essence of chaos—
The true source of embodied life,
The inception of received qi,
The foundation of nature and destiny,
The ancestor of all transformations.

When parents’ union concludes,
Essence and blood envelop it externally—
Thus: ●.
This is the Supreme Ultimate.
According to this diagram, emptiness and fullness still divide into five layers,
As in the diagram I previously explained.
Fearing the full revelation of Heaven’s mechanism,
I speak only of three, concealing two.
Pondering the diagram’s meaning, one should readily awaken.

"Benevolence" (*ren*) means "two persons"; "two persons" signifies the blending of yin and yang—its meaning identical to the previously discussed "luminosity," "elixir," and "ease." The union of yin and yang is the empty body of the primordial Supreme Ultimate. When one attains this emptiness, it is quiescent as if absent, yet active as if present; thus, the fruition of the heart is also called *ren*. Two segments conjoined are yin and yang, while at their center, a subtle hollow point appears—this is the Supreme Ultimate. Human conception follows the same pattern.

When the intermediate yin enters and takes control, stillness turns to motion, and the consciousness of the intermediate yin seizes the handle of the Valley Spirit. Buddhists also call the intermediate yin the "nature of arising and ceasing," which stands in contrast to the unarising, unceasing nature of emptiness. Thus, it becomes the master of the postnatal form-body, and only through it does the form-body begin to move—yet once the form-body moves, the Valley Spirit dies.

Those who cultivate the Dao must let the heart die and the spirit live, thereby communing with Heaven and Earth and becoming indestructible as vajra. The postnatal form-body differs entirely from the prenatal Dharma-body. To preserve the prenatal, one must serve the prenatal during the postnatal. Serving the prenatal means grasping the mechanism of movement and stillness.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Serve Heaven’s timing in the postnatal."* It also says: *"To know the subtle is to be divine!"* And further: *"The subtle is the incipient movement, the forerunner of good and ill fortune."* (See *Xici* II.)

The Valley Spirit is empty and quiescent, while the consciousness is floating and active. When consciousness dominates, the Valley Spirit vanishes. If one extinguishes consciousness, within that emptiness and stillness, the radiant, unobstructed illumination is none other than the Valley Spirit. Yet from birth onward, people are forever driven by worldly desires, causing the primordial spirit to lose its numinosity and never recover.

The Great Dao of the prenatal is simply the restoration of this primordial emptiness. Emptiness enables spiritual communion, and spiritual communion allows transformations to follow the heart—thus, Heaven and humanity unite in manifestation.

The postnatal form-body is but a skin-bag, destined for eventual destruction. Once the body is broken, Zhen and Dui occupy the positions of Qian and Kun. Qian’s true yang and Kun’s true yin retreat into disuse, deeply concealed and invisible. As the *Canticle* says: *"The primordial essence is too subtle to behold; the formed is easy to measure, while the unmanifest is difficult to contemplate."*

Zhen consists of two yin and one yang; Dui, two yang and one yin. The three yin and three yang are jumbled and impure, hence not true yin and yang—yet true yin and yang must emerge from within them.

Buddhists speak of "inner nurturance," while Daoists speak of "outer refinement." Inner nurturance means nurturing this quiescent extinction; outer refinement means refining this emptiness—both are one and the same. The Dao says: *"It is not in the colored body, yet not apart from the colored body."* Buddhism says: *"Neither inside nor outside, form is emptiness, emptiness is form"*—again, one and the same.

Since the postnatal form-body has lost its ancestral nature and lacks the prenatal, one must serve Heaven’s timing to seek the path of return. The method lies first in seeking primordial chaos to restore the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate, then advancing from chaos to emptiness to restore the true emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate. Only then does wondrous existence arise from true emptiness, returning one to the original face before parents’ birth.

Terms like *"gathering the Five Agents,"* *"harmonizing the Four Images,"* *"the three families meeting,"* and *"converging the three into one"* all refer to the restoration of the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate. Hence the discourse on the *"cauldron."*

The cauldron is the heart, which is Qian; the vessel is the body, which is Kun. Qian is *"having within non-being"*; Kun is *"non-being within having."* Between Qian and Kun lies the *"empty center."* The empty center is neither being nor non-being, yet both being and non-being—this is true intention.

Body, heart, and intention are humanity’s three families, yet they are not the physical body, heart, or intention. Only those whose postnatal bodies are broken, at the initial stage of practice, must temporarily rely on the colored body as a framework, employing only the postnatal body, heart, and intention.

One must forget the form to reveal its function; extreme emptiness and profound stillness are the practice. Thus, the *Canticle* says: *"What is natural is not a deviant or false Dao."* The *Daodejing* states: *"Heaven follows the Dao, the Dao follows spontaneity."*

In cultivation, body and heart are the substance, spirit and qi the function; intention is the substance, true intention the function. The body is the yang qi of the Gate of Life, located between the Gate of Life and the yin heel vessel—hence it is called *"body"* rather than *"Gate of Life."*

The *"heart"* is not the fleshy heart but the numinous, unwavering primordial spirit, dwelling neither inside nor outside, its essence originally empty. Kan is the qi-body, with Kan’s single yang (the true qi within the body); Li is the spirit-heart, with Li’s single yin (the primordial spirit within the heart). When they govern within the body, both become consciousness. Why not call it *"consciousness"* but *"heart"*? Because when emotional consciousness is extinguished, the Heavenly Heart appears, and the primordial spirit is restored—hence it is still called *"heart."*

Transforming being into non-being is the Dao-heart; failing to sever worldly passions is the human heart—both are metaphorical, not the physical body or heart.

Intention is the two earths, Wu and Ji. When the two earths merge, they form the true intention of the central palace, the third entity born of the union of spirit and qi. In a state of undifferentiated chaos, neither intending nor not intending, heart and breath interdepend, spirit and qi unite, no thought arises, no intention scatters. When harmony and congealment occur, the two earths form a jade tablet, and true intention appears.

The Buddhist school refers to it as *"lucid solitary radiance,"* symbolizing its state of non-being. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of *"sitting with warmth descending,"* while Ancestor Lü describes *"the gentle warmth of the lead cauldron, light piercing the curtains"*—these symbolize its state of being. Both instances of *"warmth"* arise from observed phenomena. When spirit and qi merge and lead has entered the cauldron, within the empty aperture there appears a wisp of misty qi, a subtle warmth faintly perceptible. When light pierces the curtains, whether the eyes are closed or open, illumination enters the eyelids. Yet this only occurs upon reaching the state of *"sitting with warmth descending"*—all these are tangible manifestations of undispersed true intention.

The *Daodejing* states:
*"Vague! Elusive! Yet within it there are images.
Elusive! Vague! Yet within it there are entities.
Dim! Obscure! Yet within it there is essence.
Its essence is utterly real—within it there is sincerity."*
The images, entities, and essence here all refer to the wondrous being within true emptiness—all are phenomena arising after the cessation of thought. These may be contemplated in moments of extreme emptiness and profound stillness. Yet these few lines encompass myriad phenomena, which will be elaborated later.

**Lecture Four: Internal Nurturance of Emptiness Externally Generates True Yang**
*"Though it governs as master, its pairing is perfect—*
*what the common folk use daily yet remain unaware of"*
refers precisely to this spirit and qi.
Spirit governs as master, qi enables movement.
Empty yet numinous, hence called *spirit*; existing as if non-existent, hence called *qi*.
When flowing outward, the six roots become the portals through which spirit and qi enter and exit. Through these portals, one discerns the myriad forms and colors, and the consciousness-spirit takes charge—thus spirit and qi are harmed.
The consciousness-spirit is the master of the six consciousnesses. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent are the six roots; form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas are the six dusts. When roots and dusts meet, the six consciousnesses arise. The six consciousnesses are in truth one consciousness, with spirit concealed in the root of intent. If this root of intent is extinguished, then as Mañjuśrī said, *"When one root returns to its source, the six roots attain liberation."*
The *"world"* in Avalokiteśvara’s name refers to this world of consciousness. When this world of consciousness is dissolved, the six roots naturally become pure, and the consciousness-spirit reverts to primordial spirit. Primordial spirit is the Valley Spirit, and the Valley Spirit is fundamentally empty—thus it does not die and endures eternally.
*"Returning to the source"* means withdrawing vision and reversing hearing. The *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—*
*seal them tightly, let nothing pass.*
*Silence seals the trigram Dui,*
*rare words align with primordial chaos."*
This is the intent of sealing the six roots. When heart and intent are emptied, one naturally returns to primordial spirit and does not die.
The Buddhist scriptures say: *"With a single thought turned back, one instantly regains the original attainment."* *"Turned back"* means mouth-to-mouth alignment—great emptiness with small emptiness. If one recognizes this mechanism and turns back a single thought, one becomes identical to one’s original attainment. It also says: *"Directly accept and uphold."* The top of the character *"uphold"* resembles a head; the *"mouth"* is emptiness, and the *"field"* is the elixir field. Within the human body, only the ancestral aperture is vertical—all else is horizontal. (This is the ancestral aperture.) If one can directly accept and uphold from below, one naturally returns to the source and reverts to the root.
The *Heart Sutra of the Jade Emperor* states: *"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence."* What humans use daily are precisely these three substances: essence, qi, and spirit.
Spirit is formless and belongs to yang; qi has form and belongs to yin; essence is corporeal. The essence exchanged between man and woman is lustful essence. Before intercourse, essence is stored in the Gate of Life. When desire arises in the heart, a qi descends from the brain to the Gate of Life, transforming into essence and being expelled. This occurs because the heart stirs, emotions follow, spirit moves, and qi accompanies it—spirit and qi unite to form essence, the union of one and two producing three. Thus, the essence of intercourse is *shun* (sequential), generated by the stirring of desire that rouses spirit and qi. For the Dao cultivator, the *huo zi* (living midnight) is *ni* (reversed), formed by the surge of yang qi in heaven and earth. Yang nature ascends, thus it can rise from below to above, returning essence to replenish the brain—this is the distinction.
Qi is the treasure of life for the corporeal body; the physical form relies on qi for movement. Originally external, it is drawn in through the mouth and nose to become the body’s master. When breathing ceases, death follows immediately. Its arrival is summoned by the body’s postnatal prenatal qi. This postnatal prenatal qi first resides in the Gate of Life, later in the Yin Heel Vessel. Though it differs in purity from external qi, its nature is the same—both are qi. Thus, by the principle of like attracting like, it is drawn inward. This is akin to a magnet attracting iron or two electrical charges drawing each other. This qi arrives at the moment of parental intercourse, enabling the summoning of external qi to initiate respiration.
Daoist texts say: *"If even a trace of yin qi remains in the body, one cannot become an immortal."* Yin qi refers to the external qi of postnatal breathing. *"If even a trace of yang qi remains, one does not die."* Yang qi refers to the postnatal prenatal qi of the Gate of Life and Yin Heel Vessel. Its presence enables breathing and sustains vitality, hence one does not die.
The breath’s qi enters from outside, first reaching the lungs. The *Huangting Jing* names the lungs *"White Origin"* and also *"Formed by Emptiness,"* for the lungs are empty, formed by the accumulation of qi. Thus, within the body, the lungs open and close with each inhalation and exhalation; the qi’s entry and exit cause the lungs to open and close. The lungs’ opening and closing follow the qi’s movement in and out.

The qi’s exit and entry are in truth summoned by the postnatal prenatal qi. This qi is also called *"original qi"* (元气), stored in the Yin Heel Vessel, communicating with the crown of the head. Though seemingly unmoving, it is in constant motion—rising and falling, mutually interacting—thereby drawing external qi into the lungs. The lungs open and close in response, all by the power of this qi.

Modern Western medicine likewise recognizes that qi enters the lungs from outside, causing the lungs to open and close. Yet if asked how the qi comes, they cannot answer, for they are unaware of the invisible principle by which original qi summons and governs it.

When an infant descends to earth and external qi enters its mouth, Daoist texts call this *"a single arrow piercing the Primordial Chaos."* Lü Dongbin said: *"When speaking of the moment of receiving qi at birth, marvel not that the celestial mechanism is fully revealed."* For the reception of qi in humans is divided into prenatal and postnatal.

At conception, the primordial ancestral qi one receives pertains to the state before parents’ birth—one’s inherent empty nature. At birth, the qi drawn in through breathing pertains to the moment of being born by parents—the precious life of the formed body. The four characters *"receiving qi at birth"* (生身受气) reveal the mechanism of both prenatal and postnatal.

From the intermediate yin, one comes into being, occupying the Central Palace. Nature ascends to the crown, while life enters the Gate of Life. The Supreme Ultimate divides into the Two Modes, giving rise to life below. Once the umbilical cord is cut, air rushes into the mouth and nose, and breathing begins. From then on, each breath remains connected, and this breathing qi becomes the means to nourish the formed body. The five senses and four limbs thereby gain movement; with every inhalation and exhalation, there is no moment of cessation.

Thus, postnatal breathing clings to the original qi, causing it to congeal and not disperse. Because it does not disperse, it can continue to summon and govern the qi of breathing. The two qi mutually sustain each other, enabling human existence—a ceaseless cycle.

The original qi resides between the navel, the Gate of Life, and the Yin Heel Vessel. The *Inner Classic* names it *"Pass of Origin"* (关元) and *"Sea of Qi"* (气海). *"Pass of Origin"* refers to the barrier that contains this original qi, or the pass formed by the original qi itself. When the fetus takes shape in the womb, the original qi already dwells here, allowing communication with the mother’s breathing.

This original qi arises from the harmonious fusion of the parents’ qi, sharing the same essence as the generative qi of the Supreme Ultimate. After the union of father and mother, the father’s essence and mother’s blood enclose the prenatal qi and the postnatal prenatal qi, forming this body. Once formed, this qi resides 1.3 inches below the navel, becoming the core of this form.

Yin and yang intermingle, moving to open and close, becoming fetal breathing. Fully attuned to the mother’s respiration, it can summon and govern the external postnatal qi. Daoist texts say: *"Yang expands, yin contracts."* With each opening, yang expands; with each closing, yin contracts. Yang corresponds to exhalation, yin to inhalation—this *"opening and closing"* is but a figurative expression. In reality, its movement is like a wheel, turning ceaselessly, which Daoist texts call the *"River Chariot"* (河车).

The formed placenta is called the *"Purple River Chariot"* (紫河车). *"Purple"* denotes its red hue. Why is it called *"River Chariot"*? The *Canon* states: *"The River Chariot of the North."* The Tathāgata says: *"The true qi of the North is called the River Chariot."* The North corresponds to water, driven by its flow, hence the name *"chariot."* The qi of Heaven’s One descends in the North to generate water. Ren-water is formless—qi; Gui-water is formless, first transforming from qi into water. This qi is born of Heaven’s One, hence the name *"River."*

Buddhist texts also call it the *"Dharma Wheel"* (法轮), speaking of the *"Dharma Wheel ever-turning"* and *"turning the great Dharma Wheel"*—all referring to true breathing. True breathing arises from fetal breathing, and respiration follows, hence the saying: *"to return to the root and restore life."* *"Returning to the root"* means returning to the source of breathing; *"restoring life"* means restoring the life of the Receptive (坤) Origin.

Those who cultivate the Dao must first nurture this fetal breathing to establish the foundation. After birth, fetal breathing ceases, the River Chariot stops turning, yet the original qi below the navel remains congealed as a single mass, called the *"Life Stem"* (命蒂). The qi of breathing returns to the stem with every breath, reaching the Gate of Life. The true fire of the Gate of Life rises daily, while the heart’s fluids descend daily. Heart and kidneys daily harmonize, and the body and consciousness grow. From infancy to childhood, through the 5,400 days of the Yellow Path’s cycle, postnatal qi reaches fullness and breaks through the body. Then the postnatal prenatal qi sinks into the Yin Heel Vessel and can no longer ascend.

Though the qi scatters and sinks, its power to summon remains unchanged. Moreover, when transforming essence, it must rely on this original qi. When desire stirs, spirit descends and unites with qi, transforming into essence and discharging externally. Thus, each stirring of desire depletes essence, qi, and spirit once; when exhausted, one dies. Human life truly depends on these Three Treasures—essence, qi, and spirit.

In daily life, all activities deplete spirit and qi. The *Classic* says: *"The eyes are dazzled by the five colors, the ears confused by the five sounds."* The saying goes: *"The mouth opens and spirit-qi scatters; the tongue moves and disputes arise."* Here, *"mouth"* refers not merely to the organ of eating but to the gateway of the six senses. Only *"the tongue moves and disputes arise"* specifically refers to the mouth of eating.

For speech is the voice of the heart, and the tongue its sprout—thus, the arising of right and wrong largely stems from the mouth and tongue. Moreover, dazzlement and confusion at the gates of the six senses leak and dissipate spirit and qi. Daily indulgence in desire causes these leaks to grow ever greater, and so one gradually weakens, ages, sickens, and dies—this is the natural course of creation. Thus, to follow this course without change is to be born and to die; to reverse it and return is to attain longevity and become an immortal.

The *shen* of consciousness grows more acute the more it is used. All post-natal wisdom arises from this *shen* of consciousness, yet the sharper it becomes, the deeper one falls. Deceit, crime, fraud, and falsehood—all are governed by this *shen* of consciousness. The original spirit (*yuan shen*), however, is otherwise: unknowing and unperceiving, it follows the decree of the Emperor and moves in accord with the spontaneity of creation, thereby achieving numinous communion. The *Yinfu Jing* speaks of a single word—“stealing”—referring to the theft of the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, which is the work of the original spirit. In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong descends to the world as a stone monkey: the stone is solidity, born of emptiness within. Yet he steals weapons, steals the golden-hooped staff, steals peaches, steals wine, steals elixir—nothing he does not steal. When he steals weapons in the Country of Aolai, these are still ordinary weapons, mere metal—post-natal. But when he steals the golden-hooped staff from the Crystal Palace, it is true lead, metal within water—primordial qi. Stealing peaches is wood; stealing wine is the water of the tenth Earthly Branch; originally belonging to the east, it is born in the west, where metal and wood converge. Stealing the elixir is the harmony of yin and yang. Thus, the more he steals, the greater his spiritual powers grow. Like one born below, by the day of “five thousand four hundred births in the Yellow Path,” there is no day he does not steal—all is done in unknowing and unperceiving, to complete the body of a pure yang youth. Qian is pure yang, is Heaven, hence “Equal to Heaven.”

The *Yinfu Jing* says: *“When the three thefts are fitting, the Three Powers are at peace.”* Even Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon are thieves—they steal the qi of the Great Ultimate to become the qi of creation, the principle of which is the same. Primordial qi comes from without to become the master within me; post-natal qi also comes from without to become the master of my body. Where there is an outer, there must be an inner: the inner is spirit, the outer is qi. The original spirit shares the same substance as the primordial nature of Qian; when it later transforms into the *shen* of consciousness, it too becomes a master within me. All movement and action are governed by spirit, yet without qi, it cannot communicate or command the physical body. Thus, spirit is the master—the formless master, the master of the heart; qi is the master—the embodied master, the master of the body. Spirit can be the master of the Dharma-body, and when harmonized with primordial qi, it forms the yang spirit. This primordial qi can also return the *shen* of consciousness to the original spirit, giving birth to the fetal immortal.

The *Huangting Jing* speaks of “threefold zither-heart,” which is the harmonizing of spirit and qi. For the qi of breathing is not the root of life, yet the root of life resides within it; the spirit of thought is not the root of nature, yet the root of nature lies within. Thus, through the post-natal one returns to the primordial—emptiness without substance, not following the dictates of the *shen* of consciousness. When nature abides and qi returns, the Way is attained.

In humans, spirit is internal and qi external; spirit is the host and qi the guest. When qi moves, spirit moves; when breath turns, thought arises. With each inhalation and exhalation, the six sense objects—form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharma—come into being. Spirit, drawn outward by qi, daily follows this course, scattering spirit and depleting essence until qi is cut off. Thus arise aging, sickness, and death—this is the common path. Though one may bear sons and daughters, the original body is never without decay.

The immortal path, however, reverses this: inner emptiness draws outer fullness; outer emptiness gives rise to inner fullness. That which is originally void, when I make it solid, becomes real; that which is originally guest, when I welcome it, becomes host. By inverting host and guest, they return together to the Great Ultimate of emptiness, to recreate nature and life. Hence, the alchemical classics repeatedly speak of “recreating Heaven and Earth,” and the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *“To employ them, one must divide the left and right armies—let them be host while I am guest.”* The “left and right” refer to my own emptiness communicating with the emptiness of the Great Void. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its utmost, one merges with the Great Void—no self, no other, no thing, no dharma—utterly as before the division of the primordial chaos. Within this profound and indistinct state, there arises a speck of true yang, of the same kind as the primordial nature of Qian.

Just as that guest comes from without to stand before me, the alchemical classics speak of *“when lead arrives, the medicine is born,”* *“true yang comes from the midst of emptiness,”* *“the nine-three man comes to lodge,”* *“within it there is an image, within it there is essence, its essence most true.”* At this moment, if I am neither startled nor afraid, neither awed nor alarmed, but rest in my emptiness and guard my stillness, unknowing and unperceiving, following its spontaneity—then in an instant, the Qian metal buried within Kan, hidden in the great abyss, deep and unfathomable, obscured and hard to perceive—the primordial nature of the life-receiving qi of Qian—suddenly surges forth by the principle of like attracting like, like a magnet drawing iron. It unites with the true yang that has come from without. The alchemical classics speak of *“mercury welcoming the medicine,”* *“gathering the medicine and returning to the furnace,”* *“marrying the Golden Lord as an old husband,”* *“the maiden of sixteen going to prepare the bed,”* *“leading the White Tiger home to raise,”* *“within it there is a sign.”* All refer to this.

This is the welcoming of the guest from without, making it the master of my Central Palace. My teacher, Master Dongting, said: "After I received the oral instructions, whenever I practiced, I would see Grandfather Sun come before me. I would quickly respond, saying: ‘I willingly step down as guest, for you are my old master. I beg you to come to my home as the new host, so together we may set up the furnace and cauldron to transform this mortal frame.’"

Yet when the primordial true yang arises, it flashes like lightning and is gone in an instant. If one is startled or attached to appearances, or if the mind stirs with thoughts, or if one cannot maintain emptiness and stillness, then it cannot be gathered. In a moment, it transforms into the postnatal and can no longer be used—this is called "missing it face to face." From ancient times to the present, how many have missed it in this way? Every person has a moment when yang arises, but those who do not recognize it invariably miss it and let it transform naturally.

For though the lead arrives, if the mercury does not welcome it, awareness is not keen, and the heart is not empty. Among those who cultivate the Dao, many miss it face to face—some fail to recognize Grandfather Sun, some become attached to the images in their minds or the visions before their eyes, and some, upon this awakening, are at a loss for what to do. All these are signs that the work of refining the self is not yet ripe; thus, the work of refining the self is endless.

If this true yang is made the master within, then the original spirit gradually returns while the conscious spirit gradually fades. As this shift occurs little by little, the abdomen becomes full. When the abdomen is full, the heart dies and the spirit lives—what worry is there then that the conscious spirit will cause harm? *"Drawing from Kan to fill Li,"* *"accumulating metal to fill the abdomen"*—all refer to this. *"Returning to my original nature,"* *"restoring my original spirit"*—these also refer to this.

Kan is without; Li is within. One is inner, one is outer; one is spirit, one is qi; one is emptiness, one is fullness. Li is empty within and full without, with spirit residing in qi—this spirit is what I inherently possess. Kan is full within and empty without, with yin dwelling outside yang—this qi comes from without, and what comes from without is fullness, the wondrous existence within true emptiness. What is within is emptiness, the true emptiness within wondrous existence.

Observe the diagram below to understand: In the primordial state, Kan and Li reside in the west and east; in the postnatal state, Li and Kan transform into Zhen and Dui. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"The dragon of Zhen mercury emerges from the land of Li; the tiger of Dui metal is born in the region of Kan."* Zhen and Dui are Li and Kan. The union of Kan and Li, water and fire, is the same as the pairing of Zhen and Dui, metal and wood.

The dragon emerges from fire, for east (three) and south (two) share the same body. The tiger is born from water, for north (one) and west (four) share the same body. East and west are thus south and north; metal and wood are water and fire; the Five Phases are the Four Symbols; the Four Symbols are the Three Families; the Three Families are inner and outer; inner and outer are one family. All unions of water and fire, all pairings of metal and wood, occur within the Yellow Court of the Central Palace, guided by true intention.

The Yellow Court is earth; intention is also earth. Transformations come and go, returning to earth. Earth is the One; the One is emptiness, the Supreme Ultimate. The practitioner’s work lies in the inner spirit and outer qi—spirit is the self. In relation to others, the self is one, while others are two. The common worldly reference to "I" often points to the nose, which holds deep meaning, for the physical form is governed by the nose. This "I" refers to the emotions and perceptions of the intermediate state.

When a person is born, they receive the primordial qi of the One, without knowledge or perception. By the tenth month, they are stirred by the external intermediate state, which becomes their master, and only then do they gain awareness. It is through this awareness that the sense of self arises—this is what is meant by "I," and this "I" is the conscious spirit. Yet the conscious spirit contains the roots of karmic obstructions, compounded by habitual tendencies, making it the false self.

The "true self" is the primordial Qian nature received at birth. In Confucian terms, this qi is the principle within the Supreme Ultimate; in heaven, it is fate; in humans, it is nature, the foundation of life, complete and without lack. At death, the conscious spirit, burdened with karmic roots, falls into hell and suffers retribution, while the primordial Qian nature returns to the great void, neither born nor destroyed. Only this unborn and undestroyed nature is the true self.

The cultivator must merge the conscious spirit into nature, transforming the false self into the true self, thereby cutting off the roots of karma and entering the state of *nirvana* without remainder. The true self, in its original state, possesses boundless potential, but the false self usurps its mastery and drives it into the nine abysses, where it becomes utterly obscured. The false self, having become the host in place of the guest, entangles itself with the roots of sensory experience and thus falls into degradation.

If one fails to distinguish clearly, mistaking the conscious spirit for the true self and taking it as the basis for cultivation, Buddhist texts call this "mistaking the thief for one’s child." One must dissolve this conscious spirit, transforming the false into the true. The scriptures say: *"Push emotion to unite with nature,"* meaning to push the conscious spirit of the false self to merge with the true self.

Now, speaking of nature and emotion, the *Canticle* says: *"Nature presides within, emotion governs without."* Nature is the quiescent, unmoving empty body, still and unmoving. Emotion, however, is fond of movement, engaging with the roots of sensory experience and daily racing outward. Emotion refers to the seven emotions, and their arising all stem from consciousness. For they are only stirred after being provoked by external influences—there is no joy, anger, sorrow, or delight that arises without external provocation. Thus, one is always moved by what is without, and emotion stirs within.

Emotion stirs within and manifests without. The six consciousnesses excite it, and only then do the seven emotions respond—emotion arises from consciousness, and consciousness is revealed through emotion. As emotion and consciousness mutually arise, the six roots never return to their source. The lord of heavenly nature is thus obscured, losing its truth. As Immortal Cao Xian Gu’s *Ode to Qian Gold* says: *"In former years, clouds and mist deeply veiled me; today, we meet with the Dao-eye opened."*

Moreover, the Valley Spirit is called the primal qi born of the Great Ultimate, of the same kind as Heaven and the same body as the Great Void, hence the saying: *"That which Heaven commands is called nature."* Nature is fundamentally unmoving, thus *"presiding within"*; emotion, however, is ever-moving without, thus *"governing without."* What does *"governing"* mean? It means governing the six consciousnesses—defending against the six external thieves to prevent their intrusion, so that the six consciousnesses do not arise. If the six consciousnesses do not arise, the seven emotions remain unstirred; even if occasionally provoked, all responses remain measured. When measured, harmony is achieved.

What is harmony? It is the harmony of nature, the unity of inner and outer—this unity is the *"central"* state before arousal, which is nature itself. The centrality of nature and the harmony of emotion are the Dao’s *"central"* and *"one"*—the all-pervading Way. By governing emotion externally, nature naturally rests within. When emotion governs the external consciousness and consciousness dissolves, emotion returns to the primordial emotion of pre-heaven, the false merges into the true, and Qian Gold is restored.

The alchemical texts speak of primordial essence and primordial emotion, dissolving the false self and pushing it outward to summon the true self, forming the Golden Duke—this is the meaning of *"reversal."* To push emotion to unite with nature, one must first build dikes to defend against external provocations. If external provocations do not enter, the false self naturally dissolves, and the true self gradually returns.

Yet to summon the true self, one must first expel the false self from the spirit-terrace and sweep it clean—this is the essential work. Thus, one must begin within, though its function lies without, as the scriptures say: *"dual cultivation of inner and outer."* This is the origin of the work of return.

The *Canticle* says: *"Within, nurture the self, tranquil and void. The original root, hidden yet luminous, inwardly illumines the body. Seal the senses, fortify the spiritual root. The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl. Though unseen, it is near and easily sought."* This speaks of the initial work of nurturing nature, which is the dike of defense against externals.

*"Nurturing the self within"* refers to refining the self—cultivating the self within one’s small void, first achieving *"tranquility and emptiness"* to connect with the great void beyond, thereby merging into chaos and summoning the true self. The true self is the Qian nature, originally wondrously luminous, utterly empty yet utterly real. *"Hidden"* refers to its quiescence; when veiled by the false self’s conscious spirit, it becomes concealed in secrecy, unseen and ungraspable.

Yet its numinosity still inwardly illumines the body—how can this be known? Consider a person in deep sleep, devoid of knowledge, the conscious spirit dissolved, utterly still—yet spiritual awareness emerges. If someone calls from the side, they awaken; this awakening is the awareness of spiritual luminosity, not the conscious spirit’s awareness. Or when one encounters calamity and perceives omens beforehand, this too is the numinosity within nature. For the cultivator, if one can achieve tranquility and emptiness, one can restore this luminosity.

For nature is the fundamental substance, and emptiness is what nature itself generates. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the heart naturally brightens and nature naturally appears. The key lies in *"sealing the senses."* The *"senses"* (dui) refer not to the mouth that eats and drinks, but to the gateways of the six roots. Blocking the six roots prevents inner thoughts from leaking out and outer thoughts from entering—withdrawing sight and reversing hearing, so they do not engage with externals. This is the Way of *"restraining the self and returning to propriety."* When seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting do not transgress propriety, one naturally restrains the self and returns to propriety, and *"all under heaven returns to benevolence."* Benevolence is nature.

The *"spiritual root"* is the primordial qi of pre-heaven—this is benevolence, *"that which ceaselessly generates is called benevolence."* Benevolence is the spiritual root of the myriad things. Fortifying it is *"holding fast to the center."* It is like building a wall—tending and strengthening it until it becomes firm. This is the work of laying the foundation.

The Three Lights in heaven are the sun, moon, and stars; in man, the Three Lights are the ears, eyes, and mouth. This "mouth" does not refer merely to speech but to all gates of ingress and egress. Only when they are sunk into the abyss can one "warmly nurture the child-pearl." The child-pearl is the pearl of nature—when tranquil and empty, nature is restored, hence it is called "child." The adept refines the Dharma-body through the physical form, returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, thus regarding the postnatal as the mother and the prenatal it generates as the child. "Pearl" signifies roundness and luminosity, denoting its original radiance.

First, one must submerge the Three Lights: the eyes do not see yet spirit congeals, the ears do not hear yet essence solidifies, the mouth and nose remain unmoving and qi gathers. The outward leaks of the Three Lights are gathered and sunk into the great abyss, so that the lost pearl may be returned to Hepu. Though this pearl is "invisible when sought," it is in truth "near and easily attained"—what is meant by "the Dao is before one’s eyes." As *The Awakening to Reality* states: "Once true gold returns to the golden house, a single luminous pearl will never depart." This is that pearl.

For those cultivating the Dao who seek the Scarlet Water’s Mystic Pearl, let "Wangxiang" retrieve it. Wangxiang means "unknowing and unrecognizing." Once, the Yellow Emperor lost his pearl and sent Liming to search for it, but to no avail; Wangxiang, however, chanced upon it. This signifies that only without the intent to seek the pearl can one obtain it.

Daoists call this pearl the "Spirit Pearl" or "Treasure Pearl"; Buddhists name it the "Muni Treasure Pearl" or "śarīra." Daoists also refer to it as the "Elixir Head," the prenatal Qian-metal of the human body. When practice reaches the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, this pearl appears and disappears, gradually becoming visible and bright. Its image manifests before the eyes—at times, it is exceedingly luminous. Daoists also call it the "star" or "Dipper’s bowl." The bowl, originally the Wen star of wood, is the eastern constellation, symbolizing the numinosity of nature and corresponding to "East Three" in the *River Chart*. It is also said, "Seizing the pearl beneath the black dragon’s chin"—this too refers to the pearl’s hidden, unmanifest nature.

When practice attains true stillness, a pearl-like image often appears before the eyes, for this is the initial revelation of nature’s light. Yet if stillness is not profound, it cannot be seen. Those who paint Buddhist images place a circle between the brows to depict this phenomenon, as the sutra says: "The Tathāgata emits white light from between his brows."

This pearl, though "invisible when sought," is "near and easily attained," concealed within the North Pole’s great abyss and born in the Dragon Palace of the Eastern Sea—hence the Buddhist tale of the "dragon maiden offering the pearl." "Warmly nurturing the child-pearl" means that before the pearl is obtained, one must remain tranquil and empty, submerging the Three Lights to seek it. Before nature’s light is restored, one must not search for it; once seen, its image appears before the eyes, its root fundamentally residing in body and mind—truly near.

All such descriptions are figurative. "Figure" means likeness—likening the matter or the state. Terms like "pearl of nature" or "moon of nature" are the forms of dharma-reality, virtual images that arise in the course of Daoist practice. Yet these images are also illusory; one must not cling to them, for if one does, the image will dissolve. As the virtual image before the eyes transforms, the mind too can no longer remain tranquil and empty.

When this image first appears, it resembles a tiny star, gradually accumulating and expanding until it brightens into a pearl. Its light dazzles the eyes, visible whether they are open or closed—hence the name "night-shining pearl." This describes the pearl of nature. In the dual cultivation of nature and life, the image sometimes manifests as the moon, and Daoist texts abound with such metaphors.

What is seen externally is called "image," while what the body experiences is called "scene." In Daoist practice, every step has its image, every step its scene; yet one must not fixate on images in the heart or cling to scenes in the body. Images arise from the union of yin and yang qi, so they appear in moments of vagueness and indistinctness—like earth’s vapor rising and, illuminated by heaven’s yang qi, forming colorful clouds that shift endlessly. When the yin qi of the human body harmonizes with yang qi, virtual images likewise arise. Yang possesses light, yin possesses color; when light and color intermingle, all manner of images naturally emerge.

As the *Diamond Sutra* states: "All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows." Daoist texts warn: "Do not cling to images." Both caution practitioners against falling into error here.

The terms "warming and nurturing" encompass the work of fire and timing. "Warming" means neither cold nor parched; "nurturing" means containing and fostering. If one falls into dull emptiness, the water grows cold; if thoughts do not cease, the fire turns parched. Cold water and parched fire prevent the formation of the pearl of the child. One must preserve the insubstantial while guarding the substantial, neither aiding nor forgetting, to warm it; and nurture it with unbroken continuity, using it without strain—only then can the hidden nature gradually become luminous, and the primordial spiritual root gradually firm. This is what is called "cultivating and nurturing the bud."

**Fifth Lesson: Utmost Emptiness and Profound Stillness—Merging Sentiment with Nature**
**The Two Apertures Method Naturally Connects with Spirit Illumination**

The *Canticle* states: "Gradually the Yellow Center becomes permeable with principle, moistening and nourishing the skin and flesh. Beginning with rectitude ensures completion; standing firm at the outset allows no holding back. The One veils and conceals—none in the world know it." This speaks of the efficacy of refining the self: the spiritual root is restored, and resonance brings immediate communion.

Once one attains tranquility and emptiness to nurture the root of one’s nature, the original countenance can gradually be recovered. By inwardly illuminating the body, closing the aperture of the mouth, and turning the light back to reflect, the spiritual root gradually grows, forming the luminous pearl that restores one’s primordial hun-tun spirit—this is the internal process. Yet the path of internal nurturing hinges on the word "tranquility," which arises from striving toward effortless ease. When first undertaking self-refinement, the six senses scatter outward, making stillness impossible. Through persistent practice of concentration—reducing and further reducing until reaching non-action—over time, body and mind attain great stability. Naturally, non-action prevails: effort is not applied, yet its function operates spontaneously; thoughts are not forcibly suppressed, yet they subside of their own accord. Only then is "tranquility, emptiness, and non-being" achieved. Within the empty chamber, whiteness arises, and from the void emerges a single point of true yang—this is the originally hidden luminous nature, forming the mysterious aperture of the central palace. As the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: "The medicine is born in the mysterious aperture."

This point of true yang is the great medicine. Initially born within the void, it has yet to be felt in the body, so one must concentrate the spirit into the qi cavity to warm and nurture this pearl of the child—the pearl being the generated true yang. "The three lights sinking" refers to concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, which is also the "mysterious aperture." The medicine is the "wondrous aperture," and also fire—different names for the same thing, known to few.

Though this medicine and this aperture are invisible to the eye, they are near and easily sought. When spirit and qi converge, the three palaces fill with qi; the mechanism stirs, and the flute sounds—then the Yellow Center becomes permeable with principle. The phrase "the Yellow Center becomes permeable with principle" comes from the *Book of Changes*, *Kun* hexagram: "The Yellow Center permeates with principle, rightly positioned within the body. Beauty resides within and flows to the four limbs." This describes the principle of external resonance and internal response.

Here, "principle" refers to the principle of the Supreme Ultimate’s qi; it also means "interior" and "ritual," as the ancient characters were interchangeable, signifying the movement from external to internal. Thus, beauty resides within and manifests in the four limbs. Only when the Yellow Center becomes permeable with principle can its effects extend to the body—this is what the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* calls "the fire timing activates the yang furnace."

When stripping reaches its extreme, it returns—*Fu* (Return) is the initial line of *Qian* (Creative). By the fifth line of *Kun* (Receptive), emptiness has reached its utmost, and stillness has become profound. The fourth line, "the sack is tied," marks the moment when the myriad things return to their root; the fifth line, bearing "the yellow skirt, supremely auspicious," signifies the rise of the primordial at the end of integrity—precisely the time when the myriad things recover their mandate. Transforming into *Fire over Earth* (*Jin*), "the noble person illuminates his virtue." "Illuminating one’s virtue" means that virtue is the principle and qi of the primordial Supreme Ultimate—"illuminating" also means "clarifying," thus clarifying one’s own luminous virtue.

"The Yellow Center becomes permeable with principle" is the resonance of principle and qi, through which true yang arrives. The four limbs are the first to respond, experiencing a sense of ease and expansion. The *Xian* (Influence) hexagram of the *Book of Changes* takes this as its image: the first line says, "Influence in the big toe," followed by "influence in the calf" and "thigh," culminating in "cheeks and tongue." The arrival of external yang is first felt in the hands and feet; through sustained resonance, it gradually extends to the entire body, progressing through *Fu* (Return), *Lin* (Approach), *Tai* (Peace), *Da Zhuang* (Great Strength), to *Guai* (Breakthrough) and *Qian* (Creative). When hardness and softness first unite, clouds drift and rain falls, and the myriad things all flourish. When a single yin meets (in *Gou*), the fluids beneath the tongue are generated. Thus, the imagery of the *Xian* hexagram culminates at the cheeks and tongue.

Shao Yong’s poem, "Thirty-six palaces all are spring," describes the arrival of true yang at the palace, filling the entire body with supreme harmony. The formless method is nurtured by yin and permeated by yang—yin is emptiness, yang is wondrous being. The physical body of form is moistened by yin and permeated by yang—yang is metal essence, yin is wood fluid. As Lü Dongbin’s poem says, "I know how to arrange the four yin and yang"—this is the meaning.

"Yellow skirt" refers to the Yellow Center; "primordial" refers to the initially permeating yang. Because it permeates principle, it is called "auspicious"—this is what the *Mirror of Ingesting the Medicine* calls "receiving qi is auspicious." In the *Kun* hexagram, from "eternal integrity" to the fifth line, integrity ends and the primordial arises, giving birth to yang. The top line marks the union of yin and yang, where "dragons contend."

The *Canticle* further states: "Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist and rain."

The steaming warmth reaches the four limbs, and the complexion becomes joyful and radiant. For this single spark of true yang is born within emptiness—precisely the image of "one yang returning" beneath the heavy yin. Thus Laozi says, "Stillness is called returning to destiny."

At the yang’s first return, it congeals within the Mysterious Aperture, which is none other than the Yellow Center. From the Yellow Center, it inwardly pervades the entire body. Though its numinous root remains within the Mysterious Aperture, its qi already fills the four limbs, penetrating above and below, warming the skin, and moistening it. As the *Clarifying the Obscure in the Kinship of the Three* states: "Nurture the child-pearl, neither forgetting nor aiding. Over time, spirit and clarity arise of themselves, gradually permeating all directions. The nine orifices, hundred vessels, three hundred sixty bones and joints, and eighty-four thousand pores of the body all become unobstructed, naturally luminous, moist, and harmonious—stimulated, they respond and penetrate." The phrase "beauty lies within" refers to the intercourse of yin and yang, which still occurs within the Mysterious Aperture. This is the meaning behind *Journey to the West*’s Sun Wukong entering the Water Curtain Cave and being named "Handsome Monkey King." The monkey represents *shen* (申), and within the character *shen* lies the center of the center—an exquisitely crafted symbol. This center is the natural endowment of heaven and earth, yet few in the world awaken to its emptiness.

The lines "First rectify, then cultivate; establish the stem before grasping the branch" clarify the necessity of nurturing and the gradual nature of practice. For the cultivator, thoughts must be upright—only the thought of no-thought is true thought, capable of engendering transformation. Otherwise, clinging to existence or nonexistence alike will fail to accord with the matter. Thus it is said: "First rectify, then cultivate; establish the stem before grasping the branch. The One veils and conceals—none in the world know it." The One, as the scriptures say, is "attaining the One, and all affairs are complete." The One is the single qi of the Supreme Ultimate. Independent and spirit-like, it exists before the division of yin and yang, thus able to generate the myriad things, to be spirit-like and transformative. In humans, it is the primordial nature of the *Qian* origin, the precelestial original spirit. Alas, people invariably obscure it with the acquired spirit, unaware of its existence and thus seeking it, drifting ever farther from the Dao.

From the perspective of destiny: when the single qi of the Supreme Ultimate has not yet divided into yin and yang, it is the precelestial true yang, the root of life for the myriad things. Humans receive it to form their bodies, hence it is called the "treasure of destiny." After the body is broken, it sinks into the Gate of Destiny, descending into the Yin Heel vessel, obscure and difficult to perceive. Though used daily, its calamities go unnoticed. Nature and destiny are in truth one thing. At the moment of receiving qi, nature and destiny are undivided; once divided, obscuration follows. People use what follows naturally and forget their origin. The *Song of Tapping the Trigrams* says, "Whispered close to the ear, the wondrous secret—ascend to Penglai’s first peak," referring to the primordial qi sunken in the *Kan* palace, which the cultivator must draw upward to the *Li* palace. "Whispered close to the ear" means one must abandon the cleverness of ears and eyes, withdraw vision and return hearing, seal the mouth and close the orifices. *Kan* is the ear, *Dui* is the mouth; speech issues from the mouth, sound enters the ear, and mouth and ear communicate through the single aperture of emptiness. By preserving nonbeing and guarding being, one draws forth true yang from the Great Abyss and returns it to Penglai Peak, concealing it within the ear.

In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong obtains the golden-hooped staff from beneath the Iron Plate Bridge, entering the Dragon Palace of the Eastern Sea to retrieve it from the sea’s treasury. The ones who inspired this were the Four Marshal Generals: the Red-Buttocked Horse Monkey and the Long-Armed Ape Monkey. The Crystal Palace symbolizes the Yin Heel cavity; the red buttocks represent the *Xun* trigram between the thighs, and the long arms signify the *Gen* trigram of the two hands holding the Gate. The golden-hooped staff symbolizes the primordial qi, able to grow vast or shrink small, to support heaven and stand upon earth, and to follow the heart’s desire. When transformed into something minute, like an embroidery needle, and concealed within the ear, it is because the Gate of Destiny and the ear both belong to the *Kan* trigram, and the primordial qi naturally flows between them. The analogy is exquisitely crafted and worth contemplating.

The *Kinship of the Three* further states: "The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—close and seal, do not let them open and communicate." This is the meaning of withdrawing vision and returning hearing. "The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center"—the compass’s center is the single aperture of emptiness. "Floating and roaming" refers to the firing times of neither forgetting nor aiding. The "three treasures" are the three luminants mentioned earlier. "Luminants" describes them from the perspective of concentrated spirit; "treasures" describes them as essence, qi, and spirit. "Turning and bending to see and hear" means focusing vision and hearing inward. "Bending" refers to partiality, through which one may advance to utmost sincerity. "Opening and closing all accord as one" means that with each inhalation and exhalation, yin contracts and yang expands, neither hurried nor delayed, matching their rhythms. From this line, one may understand that the "mouth" does not refer to the mouth of speech.

This is the foremost requirement, hence it is said: "It is the pivot and linchpin of the self, inexhaustible in movement and stillness"—that is, unbroken and continuous, deeply rooted and firmly established. The true breath comes and goes in endless circulation. Only then does the *Li* qi "absorb the constructive and defensive," referring to the aforementioned wood fluid, which from beneath the tongue descends the Tower of Nourishment to return to the constructive and defensive, nourishing the body. Daoists call this "refining the form with jade liquid." "The *Kan* no longer uses its hearing" means that when the *Li* qi returns to *Kun*, the *Kan* yang ascends back to *Qian*, the metal is sufficient, and *Kan* naturally ceases to leak. Mentioning *Kan* alone carries deeper meaning, to be detailed later in the practice.

The *Dui* union refrains from speech, uttering few words to accord with the primordial chaos, preventing the spirit and qi from scattering outward. The word "union" has a double meaning—it is not merely closing the mouth. "The three are thus interlinked": these three refer to the aforementioned ears, eyes, and mouth. "Relax the body in an empty chamber" also signifies the submersion of the three luminaries. "Entrust the will to emptiness and non-thought as the constant" means maintaining utmost sincerity, profound stillness, and emptiness. Since it is called "entrusting the will," it is evident this is not dull emptiness—dull emptiness is not the entrusting of the will. The use of the word "will" signifies emptiness that is not empty, for the true intention is inwardly guarded. "The mind is focused, neither scattered nor straying" requires not overstepping the square inch—ten characters form a vertical and a horizontal line, their intersection being the center; if one strays beyond, they have already passed this aperture. "In sleep, spirit and qi embrace" means the spirit embraces the qi in unbroken continuity. "Upon waking, await the presence or absence" refers to recognizing the "living midnight" and "living noon"—when the time arrives, the spirit knows. Thereupon, the complexion becomes radiant, the bones and joints grow firm, all yin in the body retreats, and yang qi returns. "Practice without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain." When yang qi arises in the body, it flows like clouds; when cool fluid descends, it showers like rain. Like spring’s moisture or melting ice, it flows downward from above and ascends from below, circulating endlessly between the brain and the bubbling spring. Within the boundless cavern of the Wuji, in the vast and small voids, it moves and flows ceaselessly. Due to the blockages in the postnatal physical form and its bones and joints, only this single void aperture remains interconnected. Though it moves externally, it is everywhere linked with the eight vessels and nine meridians of the entire body.

Master Zhang Ziyang’s *Treatise on the Eight Vessels* states: "The Yin Qiao vessel is a single aperture around which the eight vessels and nine meridians of the human body all revolve. When the Yin Qiao moves, all eight vessels and nine meridians move with it." The void aperture communicates with the eight vessels and nine meridians for this very reason. These two chapters share similar meanings, but the former focuses solely on refining the self, while this one encompasses both nature and life, the firing times, and all phenomena—here, the essential principles of cultivation are fully revealed.

The alchemical classics often say: "Borrow the false to cultivate the true." Borrowing the false to cultivate the true means using the false self to refine the true self. The physical body is the false self, while the Dharma body is the true self—this is spoken from the perspective of the body. The original spirit is the true self, while the acquired spirit is the false self—this is spoken from the perspective of the mind. The deluded intention is the false self, while the true intention is the true self—this is spoken from the perspective of intention. In sum, one truth encompasses all truth, and one falsity pervades all falsity. The postnatal essence, qi, and spirit are all false; only the prenatal original essence, original qi, and original spirit are called true. When these three return to their origin, it is called "perfect truth."

Yet for those whose bodies are broken by the postnatal, all three are false. Now, in seeking to cultivate them, from where can one summon "perfect truth" to replace the false? The true self is the Dharma body; before the Dharma body is formed and the true self appears, one should not concern themselves with true or false selves—both true and false are the self. It is by means of the false self that the true self is summoned, which the Daoist texts call "cultivating the true through the false." By removing the false, the true countenance naturally emerges. For instance, the acquired spirit is false; to summon the true self, one begins with the acquired spirit. At the outset, one still relies on the acquired spirit to practice, with utmost sincerity, focusing the mind and rectifying intention, merging the six senses of the false self into one. The Buddhist scriptures speak of "unifying the three minds and eliminating the four marks." The three minds are the past, future, and present; unifying the three minds means removing the minds of the past and future and returning to the single mind of the present. The *Book of Changes*’ *Gen* hexagram says, "The noble person’s thoughts do not go beyond their position"—this is the present mind that responds to things as they come. The "four marks" are the self, others, sentient beings, and lifespan, as explained in detail in the *Diamond Sutra*. Unify the six into one, and firmly guard this one. Then, return this guarded one to emptiness, and the original spirit will emerge.

However, at the beginning of practice, the great emptiness is not yet suitable. In cultivating the elixir, one must first employ existence—this is the teaching of the "land immortals who dwell in the void." At the start of entering the chamber, one cannot yet achieve pure stillness and non-action, for non-action is the work of "vigilance in solitude." If the body is inactive while the mind remains unsettled, what use is it? First, one must have sincere intention to attain true stillness; with true stillness, one naturally achieves non-action without striving for it. "True intention" is sincere intention—the six senses merge into this single, focused intention, which is neither present nor absent, neither held nor forgotten. Inner thoughts do not arise, and outer thoughts do not enter. With sufficient refinement, the mind naturally becomes still, and the intention becomes sincere. At this time, the mind is in a state of primordial chaos, unaware and unknowing. Sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, and phenomena cannot enter, and within the emptiness, there vaguely appears a solitary, luminous point of awareness—yet in truth, there is nothing perceived. Like an infant yielding to natural innocence, it is neither thought nor non-thought. The Confucians call this "sincere intention," the Daoists call it "true intention," and the Buddhists call it "right awakening." At this moment, when the true intention returns to the state of chaos, the original spirit emerges.

The practitioner of the Dao often becomes attached to either existence or non-existence—how, then, may one avoid such attachment? This is what must be deeply realized. Let us test this through practice, as in "sitting with gentle warmth." When not a single thought arises and not a single intention scatters, if the work is done correctly, within the mysterious aperture there naturally arises a formless mass of qi, warm and subtle. This qi is like breath yet not breath, truly the coalescence of spirit and qi, with true intention inwardly enfolded—this is the scene that appears. This warmth is not easily retained; the moment the mind stirs, it dissipates. With this subtle warmth as the crucible, the medicinal substance is precisely this. Without it, one is but "boiling emptiness in a cauldron," a state of "solitary yin in silent sitting."

The *Canticle* compares this to spring thaw melting ice, both containing the character for "warmth," drawing on the meaning of gentle warmth and harmonious fusion. Fire fears scorching, water fears freezing; overheating is scorching, lack of warmth is cold—neither is proper. Only with gentle warmth is the firing process correct. Once yang essence is born and the lead crucible established, the consciousness of perception dissolves, and the primordial spirit congeals. The *Canticle* speaks of "congealing spirit into form," which is the congealing of the primordial spirit to form the dharmakāya. For the primordial spirit is the master of the dharmakāya, just as the consciousness of perception is the master of the physical body—both are not apart from this self, yet the self is divided into true and false. The true self is fundamentally without birth or death; the false self perishes when its use is exhausted.

When a fetus is in the womb, the primordial spirit congeals into a spherical form—this is the fetus’s dharmakāya. Once the physical body is fully formed, the primordial spirit retreats, and the consciousness of perception attaches to it. At the beginning of fetal formation, there first exists the fetal origin—what is this? It is the nature and life stored within, enveloped by essence and blood in a spherical form. The inner emptiness is the origin of the dharmakāya; the outer solidity is the origin of the physical body. After a man and woman unite, after seven days, a pea-sized object appears below the navel, which, in stillness, can be felt to pulse, descending to the womb and ascending to the heart-mind—this is it. With this, conception occurs, and women accustomed to pregnancy know this well.

The fetal origin in the womb naturally moves at all times, but when a person is active, the consciousness of perception dominates, so it is not felt. In stillness, when the spirit’s light turns inward, it is perceived. The seventh day is the time of the first yang’s return; the Old Testament’s God creating the world in seven days also draws on the meaning of the seventh day’s return. The practitioner of the Dao must also cultivate until this appears—it is called the "elixir origin" or "elixir head," its form no different from the fetal origin. The elixir origin is the inner mysterious pass. The mysterious pass has inner and outer, upper and lower divisions, which will be detailed later.

The fetal origin in the mother’s womb constantly leaps and pulses, and when the elixir origin first forms, it also ascends to the heart-mind and descends to the Gate of Life—its form is identical, hence it is called "structuring the embryo." As the fetal origin gradually accumulates, it generates channels, viscera, bones, joints, skin, and flesh, forming the physical body. The reason the physical form grows is that spirit and qi operate within while essence and blood expand without.

After seven months, when the fetus is fully formed, spirit and qi, though formless, still coalesce into a mass below the fetus’s navel, pulsing like a turning wheel. Thus, the mother’s breath can pass through the umbilical cord, forming an inhalation and exhalation that turns without a single moment’s pause, nor does the breath ever cease—this is called "fetal breathing." Fetal breathing, from below the navel, ascends to connect with the Mud Pill Palace and descends to the Bubbling Spring, permeating every pore of the body. This is how the fetus constantly steals the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth to become human.

The cultivator must also refine their practice to achieve fetal breathing, where mind and breath depend on each other, moving together when in motion and resting together when at rest, congealing into the true golden crucible. As Liao Chanhui said, "In front, it faces the navel wheel; behind, it faces the kidneys—between them lies the true golden crucible." Li Hanxu said, "When stopping, it stops before the kidney hall and behind the navel wheel, bound within the compass and square." The Buddhist scriptures speak of the "Dharma Wheel constantly turning," referring to this.

Advancing further from fetal breathing to true breathing, the six pulses cease, qi returns to its root, and the entire body’s pores naturally breathe, no longer through the mouth or nose—placing a goose feather at the nostrils, it will not stir. A mass of precelestial ancestral qi moves invisibly in ascent and descent. The Buddhist scriptures speak of "turning the great Dharma Wheel," and Bai Yuchan said, "The spontaneous river chariot makes hundreds of circuits."

For those whose bodies have been broken by the postnatal, the breath only reaches the "Central Cavity" and cannot, with every breath, reach below the navel. The breath of the perfected person returns to its root with every breath, deeply reaching the heels, ascending and descending through the Conception and Governor Vessels, then dispersing through the eight extraordinary vessels and nine meridians. As *Zhuangzi* said, "The breath of the perfected person reaches the heels; the breath of ordinary people reaches the throat" (*Zhuangzi·Great Master*). Common sayings like "standing firm," "feet planted on solid ground," and "true practice and realization" all refer to this.

Thus, the practice of the Dao begins with the *Lǚ* hexagram. Confucius said, "*Lǚ* is the foundation of virtue" (*Book of Changes·Appended Judgments*). Virtue is attainment—attaining the correctness of principle and qi. Heaven’s virtue is ceaseless generation, and ceaseless generation arises from the flowing of the vast qi. Human virtue lies in the Five Constants and Four Virtues, and the Four Virtues and Five Constants are also born of the vast qi.

The *Book of Changes* states, "The great person’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth" (*Book of Changes·Words of the Text on Qian*). This means aligning with the correct *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. Borrowing the false to cultivate the true is to refine the Dharma-body from within the physical form. Buddhist texts speak of "removing ore to leave gold," while Daoist texts say "washing away sand to reveal gold"—once impurities are removed, pure gold emerges. The false is like ore or sand; when it is discarded, true gold appears of itself.

Alchemical texts compare the original spirit (*yuanshen*) to "cinnabar," also likened to "mercury" or "vermilion mercury," born within the *Zhen* trigram’s wood. They further call it the mysterious *qi* of the Green Dragon, which belongs to wood, and state that within the *Li* trigram’s fire lies this "wood-fluid" as mercury. Because the consciousness-spirit (*shishen*) is an impurity—like ore or sand—one must extract the wood-fluid from within it to obtain true mercury. Now, fire is born of wood, so why must wood emerge from fire? Because the consciousness-spirit obscures it: the consciousness-spirit is like fire, and when fire rages, wood is consumed; when fire is extinguished, wood fully appears. Reversing this to draw wood from fire is the method and gateway of practice.

Vermilion mercury is true mercury. To generate mercury within the cauldron, one must first place silver in the pool (the cauldron being the great and small emptiness). As *Awakening to Reality* says, "To retain vermilion mercury in the golden cauldron, first place silver in the jade pool." The method is to first introduce mercury, and then vermilion mercury can be extracted. This metaphor is most ingenious: mercury is vermilion mercury, and cinnabar arises from mercury. Cinnabar and mercury are originally one substance from the same ore; only with mercury can cinnabar be extracted, and cinnabar can also be refined into mercury. The meaning is that one must first unify the consciousness-spirit and enter it into the cauldron, after which the original spirit—cinnabar—emerges. Since the consciousness-spirit is inherently numinous by clinging to form, when it is placed in emptiness with no attachment, it can transform consciousness into wisdom, and the original spirit is restored.

Mr. Huang Yi once served as an official in Yunnan and Guangxi, where he witnessed the mutual refinement of mercury and cinnabar, recording it in his notes with great accuracy. The passage in *Awakening to Reality* refers precisely to the practice of "borrowing the false to cultivate the true."

The distinctions and transformations among the original spirit, consciousness-spirit, and intention are detailed as follows:

Initially, there is Non-Ultimate (*wuji*); from Non-Ultimate arises the Supreme Ultimate (*taiji*). The Supreme Ultimate originally contains nothing, yet possesses the impulse to move. When it is about to move but has not yet moved, it remains emptiness. The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; the single point within the diagram represents the primordial principle-*qi*. When movement reaches its extreme, principle-*qi* fills the Supreme Ultimate. At the extreme of movement, stillness must follow. Stillness generates the One, which divides into Two, becoming tangible *qi*—yin *qi*. Yin and yang each occupy a position, forming the Two Modes (*liangyi*). The Two Modes further divide into the Four Images.

The first diagram illustrates the principle of Heaven and Earth’s creation; the second, the principle of human generation, which is identical to the great creation of Heaven and Earth. The third diagram shows that emptiness is non-nature, and the original must be rooted in true emptiness. The fourth diagram, contrasting nature with emotion, represents the Two Modes of nature and life already divided—this is the original nature of humans.

The so-called original nature is the substance of nature, bestowed by Heaven upon humans at the moment of receiving *qi* and forming the embryo, before the physical body exists. This must be clearly distinguished, without ambiguity. It is "the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth," which is also the Dao.

The fifth diagram’s original spirit refers to the movement of this original nature: when undifferentiated, it is intention; when clear, it is awareness. The sixth diagram’s innate knowledge represents a further progression. Awareness has not yet become knowledge; from awareness arises knowledge, and from knowledge comes ability—this is "innate ability." Knowledge originates within, while ability manifests externally.

The seventh diagram’s consciousness-spirit is the spirit of postnatal thought, hence its division into thought and consciousness: thought arises internally, self-generated; consciousness forms externally, reactive. The eighth diagram’s original emotion is the fundamental emotion, not the postnatal Seven Emotions. It is the movement of nature when stirred by external stimuli—this meaning must be carefully examined.

Nature resides within, while emotion governs externally. Nature rules the heart, and emotion resides in the body. Nature is fundamentally quiescent and unmoving; when stimulated, it responds and emits numinous awareness. Emotion is inherently restless and dynamic; when bound to external objects, it becomes discriminating desire.

Thus, Buddhist scriptures distinguish between contact (*sparśa*) and dharmas: what is felt through the body is called contact, belonging to emotion; what is contained in the mind is called dharmas, belonging to nature. When the substance of nature is empty, dharmas also become empty. When nature is beyond description, dharmas are also beyond description. The mind is dharmas, and dharmas are the mind—this is why it is called "mind-dharmas." All people share this mind, and this mind shares this principle, hence the saying, "Hearts resonate with hearts, and a single word awakens enlightenment."

Emotion, however, is rooted in external conditions; it arises only after contact with the Six Dusts. When stirred within, it must disturb one’s essence—this is what is meant by "internal leakage following external dissipation." Thus, emotion has internal and external aspects, while nature has no internal or external. That which has no internal or external is called the "Center"; that which has internal and external yet arises from innate truth is called "Harmony." The Center is the root, and Harmony is the branch. Returning the branch to the root and aligning the root with the branch is the path of "dual cultivation."

Original emotion is fundamentally good but changes through habituation. Nature is an empty substance, without so-called change. The unchanging is without birth or destruction, while the changing is subject to birth and destruction. What causes change is solely the consciousness, hence it is also called "emotion-consciousness."

Intention arises when the original heart is about to move, appearing as a faint impulse yet not fully manifest—this is true intention, which the cultivator of the Dao must refine. Awareness represents a slight advance beyond intention, where movement gives rise to clarity. The distinction between awareness and intention lies in the difference between discernment and undifferentiated wholeness. One is "seemingly empty yet not empty," while the other is "form that is simultaneously emptiness." From awareness arises innate knowledge, a spontaneous alignment with the correctness of Heavenly Principle, responding to Heaven without the mind of right and wrong, without the heart of preference or aversion. This further develops into innate capacity. Innate knowledge and innate capacity are one—knowing is acting, without a mind of transformation; acting is immediately emptying, which is what is meant by "responding naturally to things as they come."

Innate knowledge is "the Qian hexagram’s ease of knowing," while innate capacity is "the Kun hexagram’s simplicity of functioning." The Great Dao is simple and easy, arising from innate knowledge and capacity—knowing is acting, acting is emptying, and this is the Great Dao itself. Moreover, knowledge and capacity must be united; if they are not, they are not true innate knowledge or capacity. There is no room for a shifting thought in this. Liu Wuyuan’s commentary on the *Yinfu Jing* calls them "spiritual knowing" and "true knowing." Spiritual knowing is luminous awareness, while true knowing is true intention. From intention arises aspiration, and from true intention arises true aspiration.

A single point of true intention, pure and unchanging, is aspiration. Neither attached nor detached, it is sincerity; neither shifting in thought nor generating deliberation, maintaining its undifferentiated state—this is sincerity. Aspiration carries greater weight. For when one moves a single intention without wavering, holding to it from beginning to end, this is called aspiration. As Mencius said, "Hold fast to your aspiration and do not harm your qi" (*Mencius·Gongsun Chou I*).

Thought, however, arises from the consciousness-spirit and differs from intention. Intention is about to move yet has not moved, remaining undifferentiated; thought is clear and distinct, involving specific matters and objects. Once intention becomes fixed, it becomes thought. Thus, in Daoist texts, thought is the spirit of deliberation: the past is recollection, the future is anticipation, and the present is reflection. Yet within thought, there is only the past and future, not the present. Present reflection contains awareness, though slightly more substantial—this is called "right thought." The *Book of Changes* states, "The noble person’s thoughts do not go beyond their proper place" (*Yi·Gen Xiang*), meaning they do not extend into the past or future.

Right thought is close to the Dao, which is why Buddhist scriptures speak of "merging the three minds"—eliminating recollection and anticipation, uniting them into the present mind. This is the aim of refining thought. Past, future, and present constitute the three realms, also known as the three minds. Merging past and future into the present transforms thought into awareness.

Thought arises upon contact, while intention moves spontaneously from the original heart. Consciousness and thought both arise from contact; consciousness is knowledge, giving rise to right and wrong, preference and aversion. Thought has not yet manifested externally, but consciousness is fully revealed. Nature encompasses all that moves spontaneously within, while emotion encompasses all that arises from external contact, generating the heart-mind.

External contact manifesting internally is thought; external contact manifesting externally is consciousness. Though they interact, they are fundamentally different. Intention, when shifted, becomes thought; awareness, when shifted, becomes consciousness. Good turns to evil, emptiness to existence—humanity’s fall stems from this. Consider the distinctions carefully:

Intention is sometimes called the "wish-fulfilling pearl," for true intention is like a pearl—perfectly round and pure, vanishing in an instant. When intention turns into thought, thoughts follow one another endlessly, usurping the true thought. The Buddhist use of "prayer beads" aims to transform deluded thoughts into the "wish-fulfilling pearl." Only the "sword of wisdom" can sever such thoughts—the "sword of wisdom" being the original spirit of true intention.

Within the original spirit, innate knowledge, innate capacity, and luminous awareness are all governed by the root of wisdom, the spiritual root. Only this sword can sever wayward thoughts, for only the true self can dispel the false self. The root of intellect comes from the intermediate state (bardo), which is the soul, having served as master countless times since beginningless kalpas. From remote antiquity through the Three Dynasties, Han, Tang, Six Dynasties, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing—passing through countless rebirths—it is called "wandering in the cycle of birth and death," like waves in a river, each pushing the next, ceaselessly rolling.

The intermediate state carries knowledge from past lives, which is the "root of intellect." For example, someone who recalls past-life events at birth, or writes as if they had prepared beforehand, demonstrates the functioning of this intellectual root. The root of wisdom is the spiritual root of Heaven and Earth, while the root of intellect is the spiritual root of past kalpas. There is also the root of karma, arising from the good and evil of past actions.

Daoist cultivation is generally called "developing wisdom." When intellect and wisdom unite, it is called "penetration," enabling knowledge of the three realms and ten directions, past and future, through these two roots. The root of wisdom is also the primordial spiritual mechanism. What can move is called "mechanism," hence Daoist texts say, "the mechanism is about to move," or "there is already a moving mechanism."

Before movement, it is fundamentally empty; once the mechanism moves, existence arises—this is "true emptiness does not obstruct wondrous existence." When the mechanism ceases, it returns to emptiness—this is "wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness." The "fire timing" in Daoist cultivation is like "the moon’s fullness, dependent on oral transmission."

The timely moment, the wondrousness of mind-to-mind transmission—all are mechanisms. True intent is the mechanism of life; the thoughts generated by the consciousness-spirit are called "mechanisms of destruction." The single character *ji* (mechanism) in the *Yinfu Jing* ("Heaven, Earth, and humanity all possess mechanisms of destruction") refers to the generative transformations of the forward-flowing Dao. The mechanisms of life and destruction are the initial stirrings of intent and thought. "Within grace lies harm": when true intent shifts into thought, thought becomes harm. "Within harm lies grace": when thought ceases and intent forms, intent becomes grace. The *Wuzhen Pian* states, "If you comprehend the mechanisms of destruction and their reversals, you will know that harm gives rise to grace." The two intertransform, and when intent stirs without cessation, it turns into thought. When discriminating thought halts, consciousness halts, and awareness arises. This subtle interplay, with thoughts following one after another, is called "afflictions" in Buddhism. The *Yuanjue Jing* states, "Afflictions are the seeds of samsara." If one follows and drifts with them, one enters the cycle of rebirth. The mind of right and wrong, of liking and disliking, is collectively called "entanglements." When the mind arises in response to phenomena, it becomes entangled, and where there is entanglement, there is birth and death. Only when the mind is free of entanglements can it attain purity.

These two—afflictions and entanglements—are the karmic obstructions of human life. Yet in the mutual dependence of yin and yang, intent, awareness, thought, and consciousness interact. When afflictions cease, they become intent; when entanglements cease, they become awareness. Both arise from emptiness. From nonbeing, being is born; from inherent nature, intent and awareness arise; from emotion, thought and consciousness arise. That which does not move is either true emptiness or inert emptiness. Inert emptiness gives rise to thought and consciousness; true emptiness gives rise to intent and awareness—this is their distinction.

Buddhism speaks of "transforming consciousness into wisdom" and "turning consciousness into wisdom," as elaborated in the *Vijñaptimātratā-siddhi-śāstra*. Consciousness has eight types, the seventh being *manas-vijñāna*, from which one reaches the primordial spirit of the eighth consciousness. The seventh consciousness is the "transmitting consciousness," and transmission is awareness. The principle of turning consciousness into wisdom is no different in Daoism. The *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* states, "One should give rise to the mind without abiding in anything." This mind is also true intent. It further says, "Empty the four marks, relinquish the three minds." Though Daoist and Buddhist schools use different terms for the functions of mind and nature, appearing slightly distinct, their principle is the same. The sutras say, "It cannot be spoken," and "All phenomena are illusory." "Only when one departs from all marks can the true mind be seen."

What Buddhism calls *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* (unsurpassed perfect enlightenment) is also wisdom, the numinous awareness of original nature. However, the mechanism of life arises from the root of wisdom, while the mechanism of destruction arises from the root of intellect—this is what Buddhist teachings do not elaborate. In the work of refining the false to reveal the true, one must cultivate both nature and life. Those of great spiritual capacity may cultivate only the nature aspect, which Buddhism calls the "sudden and complete method." Cultivating both nature and life is the "gradual method," yet sudden and gradual are mutually the root and function of each other. After gradual cultivation, sudden realization is still required to achieve thorough penetration. Those who attain sudden realization must also practice gradually to achieve perfection.

The sudden method does not require the cultivation of life; it returns to emptiness in a single step, fully connecting one’s own emptiness with the emptiness of heaven and earth. Upon completion, one naturally attains a thousand, ten thousand, or countless emanation bodies, with nature perfected and life encompassed within it. This method is only for those of great spiritual capacity, which is why the Perfected Zhang Ziyang taught the dual cultivation of sudden and gradual methods.

Among the nine grades of elixir methods, the highest vehicle is the most true and wondrous Dao—this is what is now being discussed. The great method of dual cultivation is this single vehicle; there is no other. Since Wang Chongyang, it has been expounded with great precision. Previously, Daoist texts spoke in veiled terms, but now there are direct explanations: taking the great void as the crucible and the Supreme Ultimate as the furnace.

The *Cantong Qi* states, "The superior virtue does nothing and does not seek through observation; the inferior virtue acts, and its function never ceases"—this is the distinction between sudden and gradual. The superior virtue does nothing; the inferior virtue acts. The superior virtue focuses solely on cultivating nature; the inferior virtue cultivates both nature and life. The Perfected Liu Huayang’s *Huiming Jing* says, "The superior virtue is the body of the eternal youth. It should be cultivated on the 'day of the five thousand four hundred auspicious births,' when true yang is abundant, enabling sudden enlightenment and attainment of the Dao. Its method is non-doing, yet nothing is left undone. The inferior virtue belongs to those whose bodies have already been broken and must employ effortful practices. The superior virtue is a body of pure yang, requiring no foundation-building; the inferior virtue, having already broken the body and lost true yang, must first build the foundation."

"Superior virtue does nothing and does not seek through observation": *observation* here means awareness, and one need not be aware of the firing times. By merging awareness with qi, returning fully to emptiness is sufficient. "Inferior virtue acts, and its function never ceases": every step has its firing times, and everywhere requires the work of observation. In *Journey to the West*, the bodhisattva Guanyin is the deity of numinous awareness and observation, constantly rescuing from difficulties—this means constantly examining the firing times, ensuring the fire is neither too hot nor the water too cold, striving to maintain a gentle warmth and preserving true intent at every moment. This is what is meant by "a single stroke opens heaven, just uniting yin and yang, the firing time gently warm."

The *Wuzhen Pian* states, "Fire is born from wood, its beacon originally hidden; without drilling and refining, do not forcefully attack." If one uses the consciousness-spirit as the primordial spirit, one will either fall into solitary yang or isolated yin, harming the body—thus one must be cautious.

To practice the false as the true is to begin precisely at the "center" within the great and small voids—neither inside nor outside, dissolving the consciousness-spirit while subtly employing awareness to guard the center and embrace the One. The center is the gateway through which spirit and qi exit and enter; the One is the root of essence and qi. When heart and breath interdepend, the lead cauldron remains gently warm, and desire is first subdued before it arises.

If awareness is overused, it becomes mere knowledge, no longer of the primordial but of the acquired, rendering it entirely useless. One must first seek true intent, uniting awareness with qi. Awareness inherently belongs to the consciousness-spirit, hence the saying "to practice the false as the true." This awareness is ordinary cognition, not innate knowledge. With prolonged practice, something arises from nothing: the Supreme Ultimate contains the Three, and true intent is born. True intent governs the entire body—what is called the "Yellow Dame" or the "earths of Wu and Ji" refers precisely to this.

With this true intent, over time the consciousness-spirit recedes while the primordial spirit advances. True intent exists only in the state of chaos, hence it is called the "chaotic primordial spirit." Yin and yang intermingle to form chaos: spirit is the formless yang, while the breath of mouth and nose is the tangible yin. Yin and yang unite to create chaos. The breath of mouth and nose, along with the consciousness-spirit, are all acquired phenomena. When the acquired returns to chaos, the acquired ceases to exist, and there is no longer any distinction between primordial and acquired—only utter nothingness. From nothing, something arises, and the primordial begins to emerge. One must return to utter emptiness and nothingness to stir the primordial qi into coming from the void.

Emptiness and nothingness correspond to the image of the *Kun* hexagram, pure yin. Only with this pure yin can one stir pure yang, summoning the primordial and drawing it forth. From the impure yin and yang of the acquired, one merges into chaos to return to the pure yin of nothingness, and from this pure yin, pure yang is born. This is what is meant by "the acquired returning to the primordial."

The *Cantong Qi* further states: "Closing above is called *having*; closing below is called *nothing*." Here, "above" and "below" refer to *Kan* and *Li*, not the virtues of above and below. "Closing above" and "closing below" describe the transformation of *Qian* and *Kun* into *Li* and *Kan*, arising from "their function never resting." Because of this closing above and below, *Qian* and *Kun* become *Li* and *Kan*: *Li* ascends above, forming the body of central emptiness, from which thoughts and intellectual deliberations arise, hence it is called *having*. "Closing below" means yang sinks and appears as nothing, hence it is called *nothing*. *Li* above is *having within nothing*; *Kan* below is *nothing within having*. Only by applying the work of closing above and below can one return. Drawing *nothing within having* upward is "offering nothing above," "taking from *Kan* to fill *Li*," after which the primordial spirit can manifest. This is the method of cultivating the lower virtue, refining the self, and laying the foundation.

This method is the "Two Apertures, One Cavity" technique (two apertures forming one cavity). The central yellow cavity contains golden qi (the two apertures are the Gate of the Mysterious Female, that is, the center). This golden qi is of the same kind as the sunken *Kan* below, and only with it can one summon and draw forth. The saying "the golden qi also mutually depends" means the upper gold summons the lower gold, relying entirely on resonance between like kinds, employing the Two Apertures, One Cavity method. Golden qi is white; to know white, one must first guard black, hence the saying "know white, guard black." Black is *Kun*, the body of utter emptiness and pure *Kun*—"guarding black" is returning to emptiness. Following this path, spirit and illumination will naturally come.

Spirit and illumination are the "white" of *Qian*-gold. Only by guarding the body of *Kun* can one stir *Qian*-gold, allowing the true self to arrive, becoming one’s master, and thus one becomes spiritually illuminated. This passage should be studied alongside the *Cantong Chan You*.

**Lecture Six: Knowing White and Guarding Black—First Returning to Chaos**
**Inverting Kan and Li—Dual Cultivation of Nature and Life**

"Know white, guard black, and spirit will illuminate itself."
"White is the essence of metal," the single qi of *Qian*-yang.
"Black is the foundation of water," the dual qi of *Kun*-yin.

At conception, one receives four elements: the nature of *Qian*, the life of *Kun*, the essence of *Li*, and the blood of *Kan*. The nature of *Qian* is the single qi of *Qian*-yang, the ancestral nature of emptiness. The life of *Kun* is the dual qi of *Kun*-yin, the primordial emotion of activity. To clarify with a diagram: parents give birth through desire, and the intermediate yin is drawn forth to unite with primordial emotion (the intermediate yin contains food and lust). Primordial emotion inherently contains the nature of material desires—food and lust—this is the root nature received from parents, but in truth, it is not nature but primordial emotion. Thus, *Journey to the West* depicts Zhu Bajie as the nature of food and lust, the consciousness-spirit. In heaven, he was Marshal Tianpeng, overseeing the Heavenly River, but for harassing Chang’e, he was demoted to the mortal realm. His true nature, a single spirit, mistakenly entered a pig’s womb, and throughout his life, he was lustful and gluttonous.

Primordial emotion is originally transformed from true nature, but because it carries acquired desires for food and lust, it strays outward. The term "entering the womb" is likened to the intermediate yin; calling it a "pig" refers to its straying into material desires, food, and lust, losing sight of the root—hence the analogy of mistakenly entering a pig’s womb. Throughout *Journey to the West*, Tang Sanzang encounters demons because he heeds Bajie’s words, showing how deeply the consciousness-spirit harms. Only at Two-Boundary Mountain does Tang Sanzang awaken the Daoist heart; at Eagle Sorrow Stream, he obtains the dragon-horse. Day after day, he remains earnest and sincere, utterly focused, and later at Gao Village, he subdues Bajie’s conscious emotions. Even after conscious emotions are subdued, they still often stir and cause demonic encounters. Only by the ninety-eighth chapter does consciousness cease to move—the difficulty of refining nature can thus be known.

Here follows the explanation of the precelestial Five Phases as depicted below:

The above diagram represents the precelestial Five Phases: True Emptiness is the Wuji; the Primordial Ancestral Qi is the single qi within the Taiji. East, West, South, and North constitute the Four Symbols. Heaven occupies the North, the sun rises in the East and the moon sets in the West, while the void between them is the fundamental body of the Taiji.

In the *River Chart*, the East holds three and eight, the West four and nine, the South two and seven, and the North one and six. The center, with five and ten, forms the Five Phases, which together comprise three families: the East’s three and the South’s two combine to make five, while the East’s eight and the South’s seven combine to make fifteen; the North’s one and the West’s four combine to make five, and the North’s six and the West’s nine combine to make fifteen. The center stands alone as five, and with the fifteen generative and completive numbers, precisely matches three fives, totaling sixty, though in reality only fifty-five.

Virtue possesses the power of ceaseless generation, thus it is aligned with the East and attributed to Wood. Spirit possesses the power of wondrous clarity, thus it is aligned with the South and attributed to Fire. Virtue and spirit—one still, one moving—stillness being the True Emptiness of virtue, movement the wondrous existence of spirit. Together, they form the number five, constituting one treasury. Emotion possesses the power of compliance, thus it is aligned with the West and attributed to Metal. Essence possesses the power of moistening and storing, thus it is aligned with the North and attributed to Water. Emotion and essence—one moving, one still—stillness being the inner storage of essence, movement the outward expression of emotion. Together, they form the number five, likewise constituting one treasury. The central palace of Wu and Ji Earth is five, standing alone as the number five, forming a single treasury. In the Dao, this is True Intention and True Breath, truly governing the movement and stillness of the Four Symbols. Thus, it is represented by "Primordial Qi," for without qi, virtue, emotion, essence, and spirit cannot move and manifest.

In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong corresponds to the North’s one and the West’s four, forming one five; Zhu Wuneng corresponds to the East’s three and the South’s two, forming one five; Sha Wujing stands alone as one five. These three fives together form one Tang Sanzang, while the dragon-horse, ceaselessly revolving in the Dao, signifies the meaning of "never to be parted even for an instant."

The precelestial Five Phases thus transform into three families, all being the functioning of the Primordial Ancestral Qi. Therefore, if one gathers the Ancestral Qi, the five can return to three, and the three can revert to one; otherwise, this cannot be achieved. The so-called three families are: the East’s three and the South’s two, yin and yang paired as one family; the North’s one and the West’s four, yin and yang paired as one family; and the central Wu and Ji Earth, also yin and yang paired as one family. The term "family" signifies harmony within the household. In Daoist texts, whenever the word "family" is used, it carries this meaning, which must not be overlooked.

From the false to cultivate the true, returning the Five Phases to the three families, is to seek the unmoving within movement and the non-still within stillness. Only then can the three fives return to one—this pertains to the precelestial. The postcelestial, however, consists of the five: spirit, essence, soul, corporeal soul, and intention.

Daoist texts state: "There is the precelestial nature and the postcelestial nature." The postcelestial nature is in fact emotion, which governs outward dispersion and constitutes the postcelestial nature—namely, the nature of qi-quality, food, and lust. Mencius said: "Food and sex are nature" (see *Mencius·Gaozi I*). He also said: "Infants know to love their parents. When they grow up, if they have wives and children, they love their wives and children; if they know the beauty of women, they love young women" (see *Mencius·Jinxin I* and *Wanzhang I*). The ancients regarded a child’s affection for parents as the natural bond of heavenly nature, and between father and child, their natures and emotions often resemble each other. This is because the root-nature carried at the time of conception and receiving qi is such. At the moment of receiving qi, when the two emotions of the parents unite and their two qi coalesce, this already carries the parents’ lifelong food, lust, and qi-quality within it. For the parents, this is postcelestial; for the fetus, it is precelestial. Thus, food, lust, and qi-quality are also called nature, but in reality, they are merely emotion—not the heavenly-endowed nature, but inherited emotion.

When the intermediate yin also carries the karmic roots of past afflictions, these karmic roots likewise constitute the nature of food, lust, and qi-quality. If an infant’s emotions do not resemble those of its parents, it is because the intermediate yin carries more of these influences.

Therefore, Daoist texts distinguish the word "nature": that which is mandated by heaven is precelestial, while that received from parents and the intermediate yin is postcelestial. Mencius’s "nature is good" refers to the precelestial ancestral nature; Xunzi’s assertion of "nature is evil" refers to the postcelestial nature of food, lust, and qi-quality. Gaozi’s view that "nature is neither good nor evil, but becomes so through habituation," sharing the same purport as Mozi’s "lament for the silk," judges nature by human conduct, thus also taking a postcelestial stance.

After the breaking of the body, the ancestral nature’s Qian Metal middle line sinks into Kun, and Kun is in fact Kan. Thus, nature falls into the palace of emotion. The primordial emotion of Kun Earth rises into Qian, and Qian’s emptiness becomes Li. Thus, emotion ascends into the palace of nature. Nature and emotion are inverted and intermixed, no longer pure. The unmoving primordial spirit then retreats into concealment, while the restless consciousness-spirit assumes central governance.

The middle line of the Kan trigram is Qian Metal, hence it is called "Metal within Water." The middle line of the Li trigram is Kun Earth, hence it is called "Earth within Fire." Yet Water is originally born from Heaven’s one, and Fire from Earth’s two. That which is born from Heaven has the nature of moistening and descending.

That which is born from Earth has the nature of flaming upward—such is the principle of yin, yang, and the Five Phases. Yet the Five Phases mutually conceal one another: when Kan and Li achieve harmony, Master Zhou said, “The essence of the two and the five mutually conceal their abodes.” This means that within Kan Water lies the true yang fire of the primordial Heaven, while within Li Fire lies the true yin water of the primordial Earth. Thus, the mutual concealment of Water and Fire arises from the intermingling of Qian and Kun.

Qian is originally Metal, yet within it resides yang fire; Kun is originally Earth, yet within it resides yin water. At their origin, they are Water and Fire; in their ultimate state, they become Metal and Earth. The Water of the One is the Earth of the Five; the Fire of the Two is the Metal of the Four—such is the cyclic imagery of the *River Chart*, from which these principles may be deduced.

Qian transforms into Li, which is Fire. Earth conceals Water, and Water flows beneath the ground—for all beneath the Earth is Water. Fire flames upward, Water moistens downward; that which flames upward tends toward the heights, while that which moistens downward tends toward the depths. Water is born of Heaven, Fire is born of Earth, and beneath the Earth lies Fire, as seen in volcanoes and fire wells. Fire wells are used to boil salt—this is the proof.

Metal generates Water, a principle commonly known. Yet Water flows beneath the Earth and is born in the Heavens: “The waters of the Yellow River come from Heaven,” like rainfall descending from the sky, flowing into valleys. All waters originate in Heaven—such are the waters of rivers, lakes, and seas. The waters of the Yellow River arise from the snows atop Kunlun Peak, melting into streams that feed the river—this is the proof.

The Five Phases mutually conceal one another, giving rise to generation, conquest, restraint, and transformation—its principles are most wondrous. Earth conquers Water, yet within Kun Earth lies Water. In ceaseless cycles of waxing and waning, Kan and Li mutually conceal one another, which is the mutual transformation of Water and Fire.

Let us first examine Kan: when Qian and Kun intermingle, one yang line of Qian descends into Kun, forming Kan—the image of Water flowing beneath the Earth. Its middle line is Metal within Water, which is Fire, the true Fire of the Great Yang. Speaking of it singly, it is Fire; viewed within Kan, it is Metal within Water. Kun’s yin naturally tends downward, yet its upward-tending line descends into the center, so its nature constantly seeks to ascend. Fire’s nature is to flame upward, hence it is likened to true Fire—this is the meaning of the hexagram’s image.

From the Five Phases perspective, the Metal within Kan belongs to the *si-you-chou* Metal triad. *Chou* Earth generates Metal, while *ji* Fire conquers Earth—this is a configuration of mutual generation and conquest. Now let us examine Li: one line of Kun ascends into Qian, forming Li. Its upper and lower lines are Qian Metal, while its center is Kun Earth. Kun Earth is *ji* Earth, heavy and turbid, unlike the soaring *wu* Earth. Li is Fire, Earth containing Fire—outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, the image of civil brilliance. Outwardly it flames upward, yet its center is empty; only when there is substance can it burn with radiant light. Thus, Li is the image of Fire, the essence of the Great Yang.

The Great Yang is also outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, containing the Golden Crow. The crow is the rooster, belonging to *you* Metal, yet its nature is yin—this is the image of Fire containing Metal. Within Fire also lies the Golden Lotus: a lotus planted in fire, the lotus belonging to Wood. Fire does not conquer Wood but instead generates it. Within Li also lies mercury, the Wood-fluid within Fire. In Sichuan, there is “fire-washed cloth,” woven from a grass that grows in fire, a plant of volcanic regions—this is Heaven and Earth’s vestige of Fire generating Wood. The Wood born of Fire differs from the grasses and trees of the world; its nature is exceedingly firm and hard, hence it is likened to true mercury.

Li is formed from Kun’s line, and Kun is Earth. Water flows beneath the Earth, so where there is Earth, there is Water—thus Li conceals true Water. From the Five Phases perspective, Li contains the *hai-mao-wei* Wood triad: *wei* is Kun Earth, *mao* is Wood within Fire, and *hai* is true Water. Both *hai* and *zi* are Water: *zi* is Earth-Water, while *hai* is Heaven-Water. Zhu Bajie is Wood within Fire, and Wood’s life begins in *hai*, hence it contains the *hai-mao-wei* Wood triad.

Further examining *wu* and *ji*: Li’s middle line is yin (--), *ji* Earth; Kan’s middle line is yang (—), *wu* Earth—together, the two Earths form a jade tablet. Moreover, the center is Earth, which has no fixed position but flourishes in all four seasons. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says, “It weaves and binds from beginning to end.” When the Great Ultimate moves, it generates yang—yang Earth; when it is still, it generates yin—yin Earth. Earth is the source of the myriad things: *wu* Earth is pure, while *ji* Earth is turbid. Water and Earth are the root of all generation and transformation, hence Li embraces *ji* Earth, while Kan embraces *wu* Earth.

Now let us discuss the *Na Jia* system: *Na Jia* derives from Heaven’s One and Earth’s Two. *Jia* is the beginning of the primordial *qi*; yang begins with One and ends with Nine, while yin begins with Two and ends with Ten. Thus, Qian embraces *jia* and *ren* (One and Nine), while Kun embraces *yi* and *gui* (Two and Ten). Qian’s origin provides the beginning, Kun’s origin provides generation. All things are born of Water, which is the first of the Five Phases. Water generates Wood, which belongs to the East and possesses the *qi* of ceaseless generation. All transformations arise from Qian and Kun, and Water is the fundamental substance from beginning to end. Thus, *ren* Water is at the beginning, *gui* Water at the end: Qian embraces *jia* and *ren*, while Kun embraces *yi* and *gui*.

Gen and *bing* share the same nature, being yang. Gen is Lesser Yang, *bing* is yang Fire, hence Gen embraces *bing*. Dui is Metal, and within Metal lies Fire; *ding* is yin Fire, hence Dui embraces *ding*.

Kan is Water and yang; Li is Fire and yin. Water and Fire are the beginning of all transformations, while Earth is the root of the Five Phases, flourishing in the four seasons. Thus, Kan embraces yang Earth’s *wu*, and Li embraces yin Earth’s *ji*. Zhen and Dui share the same principle in embracing *ding*: Zhen is yang Wood, *geng* is yang Metal, hence Zhen embraces *geng*. Yang Wood is hard in nature, yin Wood is soft—hard like sandalwood, soft like willow. Zhen and *geng* are both yang and hard, while Xun and *xin* are both yin and soft. *Xin* is soft Metal, hence Xun embraces *xin*. *Geng* Metal is like silver, *xin* Metal like gold—one hard, one soft—thus, like natures attract, and *geng* is embraced by Zhen, *xin* by Xun.

The waxing and waning of the moon relate to the *na jia* system, while in the Dao of cinnabar, the moon’s growth and decline symbolize the firing process. The newly born moon emerges as *geng*; at the first quarter, it resides in the *ding* direction, its image facing upward. Dui is Metal, yet its *qi* differs from Qian’s full Metal, hence Dui embraces *ding*. At the last quarter, it resides in the *bing* direction, its image facing downward—*bing* being the domain of Lesser Yang. Earth generates Metal, yet also buries it; by the last quarter, half is buried, hence this is the direction of *bing* and Gen. By the fifteenth day, it is the full moon, and Qian’s Metal is complete.

The phrase *"liu wu jiu ji"* ("flowing *wu* toward *ji*") refers to the two Earths, *wu* and *ji*, uniting as true intent. In truth, this is the interdependence of heart and breath, spirit and *qi*, forming the union of the two Earths into the *gui* tablet. Within one’s body, Kan and Li are harmoniously aligned; at the Gate of the Mysterious Female, being and non-being are not fixed, but interdependent and embracing.

*The Orthodox Theory of Celestial Immortals* states: *"When moving, move together; when abiding, abide together—through the subtle intent of mutual knowing, they move and abide as one."* *The Scripture of the Wisdom-Life* says: *"Harmonious following is the intent of one heart, one breath, one spirit, one qi—embracing and interdependent."*

To undertake this practice, one must first understand acquired nature and emotions. What one receives from Heaven is the ancestral nature; what one receives from parents is emotion (the prenatal within the postnatal *qi*). When Qian and Kun unite, Qian’s line enters Kun to form Kan—thus, nature transforms into emotion. The primordial ancestral *qi* is trapped in the Gate of Life, becoming the true fire of the Gate of Life, and prenatal nature turns into emotion. When Kun’s line enters Qian to form Li, emotion transforms into nature—namely, the emotion containing temperament, food, and desire enters Qian to become postnatal nature. Because it bears temperament, food, and desire, it becomes governed by the consciousness-spirit, and postnatal emotion turns into nature.

Prenatal nature enters Kun to form Kan, sinking into the Gate of Life. When still, it is nature; when active, it is the primordial spirit, also the true fire of the Gate of Life, also a single yang of Qian. The phrase *"qu kan tian li"* ("taking from Kan to fill Li") means extracting the primordial spirit sunk in Kun and returning it to Li to restore its original state. Before extraction and return, the primordial spirit falls into Kan, hidden and unused—this is the image of yang *qi* lying latent, the "hidden dragon not yet in use." The dragon lies hidden in the abyss, yang *qi* sunken, further obscured by temperament, food, and desire from without (the prenatal within the postnatal *qi* contains temperament, food, and desire). When Kun’s line enters Qian, emotion transforms into nature, now entirely governed by temperament, food, and desire. Though the outer framework is Qian’s line, it has no function; all function lies in the central line, which obscures Qian’s yang nature, leaving only yin without yang. This is the unchecked rampancy of the consciousness-spirit, the nature of the postnatal as such.

Moreover, Kan, with the primordial spirit residing within, is "being within non-being"; Li, with primordial emotion within, is "non-being within being"—the physical body is thus formed. When the consciousness-spirit dominates, the primordial spirit hides itself; nature is lost, and emotion runs wild. The practitioner must harmonize nature and emotion, likened to the union of sun and moon. Li is the sunlight, containing the Golden Crow—namely, the Golden Rooster. Metal is the killing *qi* of *you*; outwardly yang, inwardly yin. Kan is the moonlight, containing the Jade Hare. The hare is the generative *qi* of *mao*; outwardly yin, inwardly yang. This is the mutual concealment of Kan and Li, the essence of the two and five mutually residing in each other’s abode.

*The Book of Changes* says: *"Three and five share the same palace but differ in position."* (See *Xici* II) The rooster functions in inhalation, taking exit as entry; the hare functions in exhalation, taking entry as exit. The hare is a creature of exhalation, without male or female, reproducing through exhaled *qi* from the mouth. The rooster has male and female; their union is also through *qi* resonance. The rooster is most sensitive to yang *qi*—even without a male, it can lay eggs and hatch chicks, all due to the influence of yang *qi*. Yet *"when a hen lays eggs on its own, the chicks are incomplete,"* for it receives only formless *qi*, not tangible essence. The metaphors in the cinnabar texts are wondrously apt.

Li is the human heart—outwardly solid, inwardly empty, hollow within, allowing the seven emotions and six desires to invade. Once filled, it constantly overflows outward, daily drawn to external things. Kan is the celestial heart—outwardly empty, inwardly solid. Its framework is non-being, and non-being generates being. Thus, the celestial heart arises at the moment of returning yang, having no framework to admit wayward thoughts. Moreover, the nature of yang fire constantly seeks to ascend. The phrase *"liu wu jiu ji"* is also *"qu kan tian li"*—raising *wu* toward *ji* to fill the Li palace. *Ji* Earth is Earth’s ten, *wu* Earth is Heaven’s five; five resides within ten, and ten inherently contains the two and five.

Removing two from the ten of *ji* Earth leaves five; combined with the five of *wu* Earth, the two fives resonate to form a *gui*-jade. When the two Earths unite, yin and yang harmonize, and true intent becomes the master—its image like refining pure gold from ore. In numerology, this means discarding the generative numbers to retain the substantive numbers, for five is the substantive number, hence called yang Earth.

The phrase *"withdrawing as entering"* refers to the sun; *"entering as withdrawing"* refers to the moon. The golden rooster governs inhalation, the jade hare governs exhalation. Why does the rooster *"withdraw as entering"*? To crow and produce sound, it must first draw in a breath—thus *"entering as withdrawing."* Why does the hare *"enter as withdrawing"*? The hare, in exhaling to interact, absorbs lunar essence to conceive; only by drawing in lunar essence can it generate—thus *"entering as withdrawing."* The rooster crows at the hour of *yang*’s birth, for when *yang* *qi* stirs, the rooster senses it and cries first. When the moon rises, the hare absorbs its yin *qi* to conceive—both are responses of *qi*-transformation.

How can the rooster first receive the earth’s *yang* *qi*? Because its body contains *yang* *qi*, and like attracts like. The hare follows the same principle. *Entering* is reception, *exiting* is activation—*The Kinship of the Three* uses the rooster and hare’s functions to illustrate the principle of inversion. One exhalation, one inhalation; one *kan*, one *li*—the dual functions of *kan* and *li*. *Function* refers to their operation: *"withdrawing as entering"* means outward exit and inward entry; *"entering as withdrawing"* means outward entry and inward exit. Though there is inner and outer, the operation lies within, and their distinction arises from the difference between precelestial and postcelestial.

The precelestial is the true breath’s opening and closing, inversely proportional to the postcelestial ordinary breath’s exit and entry—*The True Principle of Celestial Immortality* explains this in detail. Externally, the sun and moon move back and forth; internally, the sun and moon invert and reverse. The internal sun and moon are the heart and the body, and the body is the *mingmen*. The external sun and moon are breath. The infant’s abdomen contains true breath, though unaware; those who break the body lose it.

The cultivator must first return to the child’s body, seeking its natural opening and closing. Discovering this opening and closing, one obtains true breath. True breath resides below the navel—one opening, one closing. With each opening, *yang* *qi* ascends, exhaling to connect with the celestial root; with each inhalation, *yin* *qi* descends, inhaling to connect with the earthly root. Opening and closing are ascent and descent. The breath of mouth and nose operates inversely: exhaling opens the orifices, inhaling closes them; one comes (inhales) to open, one goes (exhales) to close, and the spirit’s exit and entry follow accordingly.

Heart and breath depend on each other, but the dependence differs. The primordial spirit relies on true breath, the consciousness spirit relies on ordinary breath. Joy and anger arise within and manifest externally—anger sends *qi* outward, joy draws *qi* inward—this is evidence of the consciousness spirit’s dependence on ordinary breath. The cultivator must seek the primordial spirit’s reliance on true breath.

The postcelestial person lacks primordial spirit and true breath; one must refine the four limbs to extract primordial spirit and true breath, still seeking them within the bodily consciousness spirit. First, one must establish nothingness, placing oneself in chaos—otherwise, not clinging to form is clinging to emptiness. Clinging to form leads to the mundane, clinging to emptiness loses all—both are misguided.

To seek true breath, one must first enter chaos; to seek primordial spirit, one must dissolve the consciousness spirit. *Li* is the consciousness spirit—its emotions scatter outward, restless and wandering. *The Kinship* says, *"The radiant pearl of the great yang constantly seeks to leave the person. Only when obtaining golden blossoms does it turn and remain"*—this refers to the consciousness spirit’s tendency to scatter outward. To retain it, one must first obtain golden blossoms; only when golden blossoms restrain the radiant pearl can heart and breath depend on each other.

*"Nine returns"* is the method of obtaining golden blossoms; *"seven reversions"* is the method of restraining the radiant pearl. Seven reversions occur within the body; nine returns must come from without, yet if one grasps the method, it is not difficult. The *yang* golden blossom of *kan* constantly seeks to ascend; above, if there is a substance of the same kind, the radiant pearl can descend to it. Below, if there is something to resonate with, it will respond and harmonize.

True water and true fire—*Journey to the West* illustrates this most aptly and clearly. Red Boy’s fire is true fire, which the waters of the four dragon kings cannot extinguish; only Guanyin’s willow-branch water can quench it. The willow is a yielding wood, and Guanyin dwells in the Southern Sea—this is true water descending to extinguish true fire. Withered Pine Ravine is *kan*, the Southern Sea is *li*; above *li*, true water and true fire interact at the central palace—this is the image of *kan* and *li* mutually containing and intermingling.

The *yang* of *kan* ascending becomes warm *qi*; the *yin* of *li* descending becomes cool fluid—this is the verification of true water and true fire. The cultivator must not neglect this. The true *yang* fire within *kan* is the golden blossom, also called white gold. *"Knowing the white"* means knowing this alone; *"guarding the black"* means guarding *kun*, the boundless, empty, mysterious aperture.

Without clinging to the four phases, all things are empty—this is the image of pure *kun*. Within pure *kun*, there begins a single *qi* flowing freely above and below. This is the one *yang* born beneath heavy *yin*, like the winter solstice’s transition from *kun* to *fu*. Once this *yang* arises, it is called *"the numinous comes of itself."* If one cannot reach this state of emptiness and stillness, how can true *yang* be born?

Thus, understanding this principle, one must guard *kun*. Sanfeng said: *"To know the white, one must guard the black; to guard the black, one must know the white. Only by knowing the white can one guard the black; guarding the black is precisely knowing the white."* These words are intimate and profound—all the work of *"emptying the heart and filling the belly"* lies herein.

*Heaven and Earth unite in virtue; sun and moon unite in brightness.*
*"To gain once is to gain forever"*—this is called the Great Person.
All things arise from earth; the Five Phases emerge through earth.
In the *Hetu*, one and six: one is the celestial water of the primordial, the water of prior heaven; six belongs to posterior heaven, where earth’s six combines with heaven’s one, one added to five to form six, for the central palace’s earth-five is added to it. All posterior Five Phases follow this pattern, as illustrated below:
South’s earth-two is fire, its generating number two, its completing number seven—two plus five makes seven.
East’s heaven-three is wood, earth-eight completes it—three plus five makes eight.
West’s earth-four generates metal, heaven-nine completes it—four plus five makes nine.
One, two, three, four, five are generating numbers; six, seven, eight, nine, ten are completing numbers.
Generating numbers plus five become completing numbers.
Five is emptiness, at the center as earth; one, two, three, four all arise from emptiness.
The posterior Five Phases cannot depart from emptiness, thus they are completed by adding the five of central emptiness.
The five of central emptiness is central earth, which is why earth flourishes in all four seasons, beginning and ending all things.
The Five Phases are born from the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally empty—emptiness is earth. The Five Phases arise from earth and are completed by earth.
Among the Five Phases, earth is the most essential, hence its comparison to names such as *"central yellow,"* *"spirit chamber,"* *"center,"* and *"yellow court."*
For the root of creation and the primordial foundation of the myriad things is this earth.
North’s one is *kan*; south’s two is *li*. *Kan* receives *wu*—*wu* is the earth within *kan*.
The water of north’s one arises from emptiness, thus water contains earth.
Earth’s two is *yin*, is *kun*—all *yin* of *kun* is earth. Its nature is heavy, turbid, and congeals downward to form earth, which is soil.
*Li* is born of earth’s two, thus it receives *ji* earth.
*Wu* and *ji* are the earth of the central palace, received into *kan* and *li* through matching with *jia*.
Yang earth *wu* is true emptiness within wondrous existence;
yin earth *ji* is wondrous existence within true emptiness—this is the meaning of *yin* and *yang* mutually containing one another.
Five is *wu* earth; ten is *ji* earth. Daoists say five is *wu*, and *ji* is also five, not calling it ten because two fives make ten—this is the meaning of two earths forming a *gui*.
Two fives form the character *"ten,"* which contains five within. When heaven and earth were yet unopened, a vertical stroke | was *yang*, a horizontal stroke — was *yin*. One *yin* and one *yang*, one vertical and one horizontal, form ten.
The center of ten is the point where *yin* and *yang* intersect, hence it is called the *"central palace,"* called *"five dwelling within ten,"* which is the principle of three, five, and one.
The central palace is empty and void. The *Cantongqi* says: *"The heart is focused, neither vertical nor horizontal"*—neither vertical nor horizontal means being at the center of the cross; if vertical or horizontal, it is partial *yin* or partial *yang*.
Later expressions such as *"crossroads,"* *"cross,"* *"seen by ten eyes, pointed at by ten hands,"* and *"the buddhas of the ten directions and three times"* all derive from this one vertical and one horizontal stroke.

The above discussion of the *shen* of consciousness—its thoughts, reflections, and considerations—remains incomplete; here it is supplemented:
Thought, reflection, and consideration are one. Consideration pertains to the future, while thought pertains to the past. Examining the ancient glosses on the character *si* (thought), in terms of meaning, *xiang* (imagination) and *si* (thought) differ: *xiang* also pertains to the past, while *si* is the present.
When a single thought arises and does not yet shift, this is *si*.
The character *si* is composed of *tian* (field) above and *xin* (heart) below—the thought that arises from the heart-field is the moment the intent just stirs, hence it is called *"the present."*
Yet in a single instant it passes, becoming a *"thought"*—the head of thought.
The head of thought is purely *si*; with the slightest shift, it becomes consideration, imagination, or thought. Thus, it can be divided into three: *si* (thought), *lü* (consideration), and *xiang* (imagination).
Confucius said: *"The noble person’s thoughts do not transgress their position"* (see *Analects*, *"Xian Wen"*). The heart-field is this *"position."*
The moment it stirs is *si*; transgressing the position is *xiang* or *lü*.
The *Yijing* says: *"Fluctuating to and fro, friends follow your thoughts"* (see *Yijing*, *"Xian"*). This describes *si*—coming and going incessantly, in great multitude.
This *"si"* is the same as in *"the noble person’s thoughts do not transgress their position,"* and does not enter the realm of *xiang* or *lü*.
It also says: *"What thought? What consideration?"* (see *Yijing*, *"Xici Xia"*).
From the perspective of the *shen* of consciousness, all employ *si* at the outset.
The moment a thought arises is called *si*, *sixiang* (thought), or *silü* (thought and consideration). The instant it arises is *si*; in a moment it becomes *xiang* or *lü*.
*"The Three Hundred Poems can be summed up in a single phrase: thoughts without deviance"* (see *Analects*, *"Wei Zheng"*).
At the moment of stirring, there is no deviance; with the slightest shift, deviance arises.
*"Thoughts without deviance"* is also the meaning of *"thoughts not transgressing their position."*
The *Analects* says: *"The noble person has nine thoughts: in seeing, think clarity; in hearing, think acuity; in countenance, think warmth; in demeanor, think reverence..."* (see *Analects*, *"Li Ren"*).
Observing this, the meaning becomes even clearer.

Why is the character "thinking" (*si*) placed above "clarity," "acuity," "warmth," and "reverence"? Precisely because when intention first stirs within, the eyes can immediately see clearly, the ears can immediately hear keenly, the countenance can immediately become warm, and the demeanor can immediately become reverent. There is a governing force at work here—*si* is the master of these nine, revealing that the moment the spirit of perception stirs, it is *si*. The noble person thus possesses nine forms of *si*, while the petty person, though also possessing *si*, allows it to shift and become perception (*shi*). When the root and dust intermingle, the six perceptions (*liushi*) take form. Only *si* is easy to withdraw and does not flow outward, which is why the Confucians regard *si* as correct and say, "The noble person has nine forms of *si*."

In *Journey to the West*, when Tang Sanzang encounters the nine-headed lion, it is the steed of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Salvation. The nine lions are called the "Nine Numinous Primordial Sages," analogous to the noble person’s nine forms of *si*. *Si* is the lion, and *ling* (numinous) is the numinosity of *si*. Numinous *si* is the resource for a person to attain sagehood, but with the slightest shift, it descends into craft and depravity. The Nine Numinous Primordial Sages, originally aligned with the correct Way, transform into true intention (*zhenyi*), yet when they privately descend into the mundane world, they become demons and monsters. This arises from *si* turning into selfishness (*si*), and the nine forms of *si* becoming ordinary selfishness, where the Dao-heart fades and deluded intention arises. Without selfishness, one may become a sage or a worthy; the inscription reads, "Master and Lion Receive and Transmit Together as One." *Si* is the master, the lion is selfishness, and "receiving and transmitting" is the longevity of the beast. With selfishness, one is a beast; without *si* and returning to true intention and primordial spirit (*yuanshen*), one attains the longevity of heaven and becomes a sage. This saying is most profound. The nine forms of *si* returning to one is the return to sagehood and authenticity.

Buddhist texts often use characters in ways that do not align with their ancient meanings. For example, "Do not think of past events; do not conceive of future ones." *Xiang* (conceiving) refers to retrospective thought, belonging to what has already passed, so one cannot speak of "conceiving the future." Even *yi* (recollection) implies remembrance of the past, and to apply it to the future is clearly inconsistent.

Before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are expressed, this is called "the center" (*zhong*), the primordial spirit (*yuanshen*). When expressed in moderation, it is called "harmony" (*he*), the primordial emotion (*yuanqing*). If not harmonious and allowed to flow into delusion, it becomes the seven emotions (*qiqing*). In this moment, a single shift occurs: the center is the primordial spirit, harmony is the primordial emotion, and disharmony is delusion and emotion. Deluded emotion also arises from the deluded expression of primordial emotion, and when deluded emotion is expressed, it becomes the seven emotions.

As the saying goes: "Filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust are rooted in heavenly nature." Nature (*xing*) is fundamentally empty; what is called "heavenly nature" is the acquired nature (*houtian zhi xing*), which is primordial emotion (*yuanqing*). Thus, it is called "emotion" (*qing*), arising from primordial nature (*yuanxing*) and involving duality.

Here, I illustrate this with a diagram (incorporating integrity and shame under the character for "moderation," without further elaboration):

What is called "refining the self to establish the foundation" refers to the self (*ji*) as the *ji* of *wuji* (戊己), the earth of the self. Within *li* (☲, fire), it is the spirit of perception (*shishen*), which at the first stir tends to rush outward. Though it soars to *wu* earth (戊土), this signifies a light and upward tendency, not an outward rush. Refining the self is refining the spirit of perception, like forging metal into a vessel. However, forging requires *wu* earth; when *wu* is added to *ji*, the firm overcomes the yielding, and with one yin and one yang, it can congeal and become motionless.

*Wu* earth is the primordial spirit, sunken in *kan* (☵, water). When nature transforms into emotion, it is drawn from this sinking and added to *ji*, so that the self can stabilize, and the two earths form a *gui* (圭, jade tablet). The self is the ego; *ji* derives from the heavenly stems, borrowed to refer to the self. The meaning of the character originally comes from phonetic loan, also originating from Daoist texts. *Ji* earth is the acquired earth, used to name the self, and thus refining the self may also be called "refining one’s own self." Taking *wu* earth to refine *ji* and build the foundation is the meaning of "flowing *wu* to *ji*." Only *wu* earth can build the foundation of *ji* earth, hence it is called "refining the self to establish the foundation."

*Wu* is primordial, *ji* is acquired; *wu* resides in *kan*, as one line of *qian* (☰, heaven). *Qian* is heaven, and when *qian* and *kun* (☷, earth) open and unfold, first there is yin and yang, and only afterward are heaven and earth divided. *Wu* earth generates *qian* metal, being the root of *qian*, existing before *qian* to give rise to it. *Ji* earth is *kun* earth; only with heaven does earth exist, and the earth within it is acquired, born of *kun*. *Li* generates earth, which is *ji* earth; *kan* generates metal, which is *wu* earth. That which gives birth to me is primordial; that which I give birth to is acquired. Among the five phases, that which gives birth to me is nature, and that which I give birth to is the spirit of perception. That which gives birth to me is *wu* earth, and that which I give birth to is *ji* earth—this is their distinction.

*Li* and *kan* internally contain the fire trigram of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* (寅午戌), and the water trigram of *shen*, *zi*, and *chen* (申子辰). Their mutual generation and restriction are as described in the diagram. The wood trigram of *hai*, *mao*, and *wei* (亥卯未) and the metal trigram of *si*, *you*, and *chou* (巳酉丑) belong to *qian* and *kun*. Taking *wu* from *kan* to refine *ji* in *li* is the meaning of "flowing *wu* to *ji* for use," where "use" means function. Taking *kan* to fill *li* is the substance, where "substance" is the original body, the original body of *kan* and *li*, which is the function of *wu* and *ji*.

Commonly, this is called "returning essence to replenish the brain," which speaks in terms of imagery—transforming essence into *qi*, ascending from below. It is also called "accumulating essence and amassing *qi*," or "refining essence into *qi*," which speaks in terms of practice. Essence differs: there is primordial essence and acquired essence. Acquired essence is lewd essence, yin essence, derived from the essence of the five grains and food processed by the intestines and stomach. With this essence, the complexion is radiant and the skin is lustrous—these are the functions of yin essence; otherwise, one becomes withered. Essence nourishes the body, harmonizes the constructive and defensive *qi*, and circulates through the blood, which in turn moves by means of *qi*. Only then can the four limbs be lustrous and the body preserved, distinct from lewd essence.

Lewd essence is the essence of *qi*-transformation, originally formless; yin essence, however, arises from form and becomes formed essence. Lewd essence, as formless *qi*, transforms into formed essence—both are acquired essence, distinct from the formless primordial essence. Refining essence does not mean refining these two—lewd essence and yin essence—but refining the formless primordial essence-*qi* to transform it into *qi*.

We all possess broken bodies; if we wish to practice the work of refining essence into *qi*, we must proceed step by step. First, one must return to emptiness. Refining essence into *qi* is the work of "nine returns and seven reversions," but before this, one must first employ the work of returning to emptiness, which is the sudden method of nature-cultivation.

If we possess great spiritual capacity, returning to emptiness alone is sufficient, and no other work is needed. Whether one can follow this Way depends entirely on our virtue and spiritual capacity. In the end, the work of returning to emptiness is precisely this.

For the cultivator of the Dao, the beginning and end lie in this single matter of returning to emptiness. Returning to emptiness is the work that completes both beginning and end. If one knows what comes first, one draws near to the Dao.

Confucius said: *"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach destiny."* (See *Yi Jing*, "Shuo Gua") What we now explain is the exhaustion of principle. Only by exhausting principle can one fulfill nature; principle is the principle of creation and transformation. The generation of heaven and earth, the birth of humans and things, the unfolding of the cosmos, the conception of human life, and the ceaseless transformation and generation of the myriad things—all follow this principle of beginning and completion.

Humans and things are no exception: one must first exhaust this principle to know the Supreme Ultimate, to know that all things arise from the single *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is born of the Ultimateless; one knows that *qi* arises from emptiness, and from *qi* all things are born. Exhausting this principle allows one to fulfill nature, for nature is emptiness. The generation and transformation of creation arise from emptiness, for from emptiness arises being, and from the void comes fullness.

Exhausting principle, one knows this empty nature and the generation of the myriad kinds. When a person dies, their nature returns to the great emptiness. Confucius said: *"Without knowing life, how can one know death?"* (See *Analects*, "Xian Jin") To know life is to know death; before birth and after death, it is the same. Before birth, nature abides in the great emptiness; after death, it likewise returns to emptiness—this is called *"complete reception, complete return."* "Complete return" means fully returning to emptiness.

The intermediate state also transforms and unites with nature, returning to heaven—only then can one speak of "complete return." If one has karmic roots, one cannot return to heaven but may enter the wheel of rebirth or fall into the six paths to receive retribution. Only when one unites with nature and returns to heaven can it be called *"complete reception, complete return."* This is indeed the ultimate aim of the cultivator of the Dao.

Having exhausted principle and fulfilled nature, one knows what nature is like before birth and after death. That which is neither born nor destroyed is emptiness. When nature and the spirit of consciousness unite and return, they are neither born nor destroyed but together return to emptiness.

*"To reach destiny"* means that by fulfilling nature, one attains destiny, and destiny is contained within it. Primordial nature and destiny were originally united, separating only after entering the acquired state. After the body is broken, nature transforms into emotion.

*"To reach"* means the union of nature and destiny, both returning to emptiness. By fulfilling nature, destiny follows. The Buddha speaks of the sudden method, beginning with returning to emptiness and carrying it to its utmost, where from nothing arises being, and nature and destiny are reborn, uniting with heaven in body. Thus, the supremely wise suddenly transcend and awaken fully, their spiritual nature communicating with heaven and earth, and their destiny likewise flowing freely—this is the method of *"once attained, eternally attained."*

Once one attains it, one attains it forever. However, only the supremely wise can achieve this; otherwise, one may fail to capture the tiger and end up worse than those who proceed step by step. Ordinarily, one must follow the sequence of the Golden Elixir, the Great Elixir, exiting spirit and returning to emptiness.

The sudden method, as the Buddha says, is *"a single morning’s sudden awakening, penetrating earth and heaven"*—this is *"sudden liberation,"* which is also the principle of *"hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening without regret."* (See *Analects*, "Li Ren") Such work is not easy; it requires long cultivation to achieve.

When emptiness is perfected, all methods are complete—this is what the *Wuzhen Pian* means by *"within a single hour, the elixir is formed."* Master Zhu said *"in an instant,"* and Daoist texts speak of *"instantaneous ascension,"* calling it the *"spiritual elixir."* The spirit is one’s own primordial spirit, which, being numinous, ascends—this is called *"elixir formation."* Chen Niuwan said: *"All comes down to a moment’s work, bringing eternal ease and joy."* This is precisely it.

Returning to emptiness is returning to the void, which is also returning to *Kun*. *Kun* is the body of emptiness. Yet circulating through the six voids, *Kun* resides in the southwest—*"In the southwest, one finds companions"* (see *Yijing*, *Kun* hexagram), which signifies the meaning of *"something arising from nothing."* *"Something arising from nothing"* is true emptiness not obstructing wondrous existence, hence *"In the southwest, one finds companions."* *Companions* are of the same kind, as the *Yijing* says: *"Like sounds resonate, like qi seek one another. Water flows toward the wet, fire tends toward the dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. When the sage acts, all things behold."* (See *Yijing*, *Qian* *Wenyan*) *"In the southwest, one finds companions"* is the image of resonance among the like. Utmost emptiness and profound stillness are the function of *Kun*; when stillness reaches its extreme and moves, the empty chamber generates brightness—this is the resonance of *Kun*. *Gen* and *Kun* are opposites, hence *"In the northeast, one loses companions."* (See *Yijing*, *Kun* hexagram) For *Gen* is the mountain of form, called the *"mountain of shape,"* which Daoist texts compare to the *"colored body,"* differing from *Kun* as the earth of formlessness. In the northeast, it cannot contain, hence *"losing companions."* The southwest is emptiness; only emptiness can contain, giving birth to the myriad things, from which all things derive their sustenance. Thus the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"The medicine is born in the southwest, its native land."* *Kun* is the southwest, its body purely yin, which is also the great void. Those who cultivate the Dao begin here, where all six lines are empty—this is precisely the image of returning to emptiness. Proceeding step by step, one reverts to *Qian*: one yang arises as *Fuxi* (Earth over Thunder), two yangs arise as *Lin* (Earth over Marsh), three yangs as *Tai* (Heaven over Earth), four yangs as *Dazhuang* (Thunder over Heaven), five yangs as *Guai* (Marsh over Heaven), and six yangs as *Qian*. For *Kun* is the hexagram of emptiness; from emptiness, one generates one, two, three, four, five, and six, reaching *Qian*—thus restoring the body of pure yang.

Cultivation of the Dao also begins with the *Lü* hexagram: *"Lü is the foundation of virtue."* *Guai* (Marsh over Heaven) is *"the virtue of treading,"* the qi of generating life. *Virtue* is *attainment*; from this, one attains ceaseless transformation. The *"virtue"* by which the myriad things receive the qi of life is the *"primordial qi of Kun that nurtures life,"* distinct from the *"primordial qi of Qian that initiates existence."* This qi is the precelestial true yang qi, the primordial qi of the Great Ultimate. Its body is fundamentally empty and nameless; by force, it is called the *Dao*. *Virtue* is the common qi of life, the postcelestial qi; the true yang qi is *illuminating virtue*. *Illuminating virtue* is the qi of yin and yang conjoined in virtue, hardness and softness in balance. *Virtue* is spoken of in relation to the Dao. *"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao"*—it is nameless, formless, imageless, the true emptiness. When named, it is called the *Dao*; the *Dao* is *guidance*, leading the myriad things along their proper paths, enabling them to fully receive and fully return. It is *"the nameless origin of heaven and earth,"* the Dao before the division of heaven and earth. *Virtue* has a name: *"The named is the mother of the myriad things."* Yet *illuminating virtue* encompasses both.

Let us explain in detail: The *Great Learning* says: *"The Way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating the luminous virtue."* The first *"illuminating"* is a verb, the second *"luminous"* an adjective. The Way of the *Great Learning* must first clarify *"illuminating virtue,"* that is, understanding the precelestial one qi, the primordial true qi containing the original qi, the ancestral qi of the origin. *"Great Learning"* is the learning of the great person. Daoists call this the *"Perfected Person,"* Buddhists the *"Bodhisattva,"* and Confucians the *"Great Person."* The *Great Learning* is the learning of the great person. The *Yijing* says: *"What is meant by the ‘Great Person’ is one whose virtue accords with heaven and earth, whose brightness accords with the sun and moon."* (See *Yijing*, *Qian* *Wenyan*) The *"illuminating virtue"* of the *Great Learning* derives from these two phrases. It further says: *"Whose order accords with the four seasons, whose auspiciousness and inauspiciousness accord with ghosts and spirits. Preceding heaven, heaven does not oppose; following heaven, one complies with the seasons."* (Ibid.) Accord with heaven and earth in virtue, accord with the sun and moon in brightness—this is the one qi of yin and yang conjoined. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, are all yin and yang. Yin and yang conjoined form the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is emptiness, which is also the One. The One is spirit. As explained in the first and second lectures, *"illuminating virtue"* pairs with the sun and moon as *"change,"* hardness and softness in balance. By the same principle, *"illuminating"* also derives from the sun and moon, taking the meaning of yin and yang conjoined. Yin and yang are the Two Modes; conjoined as One, they generate the qi of heaven, earth, and humanity. In Liu Zhitang’s commentary on the *Great Learning*, this qi is called *"the principle-qi within the Great Ultimate."* In sum, it is the ancestral qi without beginning that generates the myriad things. The Great Ultimate is fundamentally empty; when it moves, yang arises, and this qi is born—thus heaven and earth are established. Therefore, the sage takes the qi of life as *virtue* and the ancestral qi of life as *"illuminating virtue."* The *Great Person* is one who possesses this *"illuminating virtue."* *"Preceding heaven, heaven does not oppose; following heaven, one complies with the seasons"*—this qi generates heaven, being precelestial; yet after heaven and earth divide, this qi also generates the myriad things. When the time comes, it generates; all resonances are answered. Hence it is said *"does not oppose"* and *"complies with the seasons."*

These two lines have already delineated *"illuminating virtue"* with utmost clarity. Yet the Song Confucians, lacking a proper foundation and unaware that *"illuminating virtue"* possesses substantive meaning, merely glossed its surface characters—thus obscuring the Great Dao.

To study the Way of the *Great Person*, one must first comprehend the principles of yin-yang transformation: formless, imageless, soundless, odorless, supremely vast, supremely firm, supremely empty, supremely real—true emptiness and wondrous being, undivided in its response to things, unfathomable in its generation of life. This *"illuminating virtue"* is the great sovereign of the cosmos. To realize this is to unify the myriad transformations, returning from the expansive to the essential, restoring one’s empty numinosity—this very emptiness is the fundamental substance of *"illuminating virtue."* This is what it means to exhaust the principles of reason.

The phrase *"In making bright the illuminating virtue"* pertains to *knowing*; the next, *"In renewing the people,"* pertains to *ability*; and the third, *"In resting in perfect goodness,"* represents the union of *knowing* and *ability*—the foundational work of the Great Dao. These three lines alone encompass the supreme vehicle of the Way in its entirety, leaving nothing unaddressed. The transmission of the Dao within the Confucian school is nothing more than this—it is the all-pervading Way.

Now, the character *"亲"* in *"亲民"* means precisely *"to be intimate with,"* and should not be interpreted as *"to renew."* In ancient times, the Way of cultivating the self and governing the state was one and the same: *"In obscurity, one perfects oneself alone"*—this is the Way of the *Great Person*; *"In prominence, one benefits all"*—this is the Way of the sagely ruler. Thus, the sages of the Three Teachings all took the *heart-mind* as sovereign and the *body* as the people. The *Daodejing* and the *Su Shu* (the *Su Shu* being Confucius’ work, namely the *Analects*) both convey this meaning. The so-called *"being intimate with the people"* is none other than the *heart-mind sovereign* descending to be intimate with the *body-people.*

The *sovereign* is the sovereign fire, the spirit of the heart-mind; the *people* are the people’s fire, the qi of the body. Beyond these, there is the *"ministerial fire,"* also called the *"minister fire,"* the fire of the Triple Burner. In the practice of the Dao, one matches spirit with *li* (☲), forming *qian* (☰)—noble, honored, great, superior, sovereign, husband, sun, crow, dragon; and matches qi with *kan* (☵), forming *kun* (☷)—humble, base, small, inferior, people, wife, moon, hare, tiger.

*"In being intimate with the people"* means the noble descending to the base, the superior engaging the inferior, the sun uniting with the moon, the dragon inhaling the tiger, the crow seeking the hare, the male descending to the female—this is the Way of uniting spirit with qi. Spirit is the master of the human body, inherently most noble; qi, sunken in *kan*, is inherently most base. Thus, the character *"亲"* is employed to reveal the work: the entire meaning lies in the union of spirit and qi, the interdependence of heart-mind and breath.

The later interpretation of *"新民"* refers to the daily replenishment of primordial qi, as when the body of a child is newly born—this meaning differs from the original. Zhu Xi, misled by the *"新"* in the subsequent text, erroneously assumed this character should also be *"新."* This is a mistake. This line is itself a secret formula for cultivation: *"The original Great Dao is not a complicated affair—it lies solely in concentrating the spirit into the qi-cavern."* Concentrating spirit to unite with qi, nurturing it day by day, one naturally becomes a *Great Person* of *"illuminating virtue."*

The *people’s fire* is the true yang fire within the Gate of Life. Originally, it is the precelestial nature, of the same substance as spirit; postcelestially, it transforms into emotion and is called the *people’s fire.* Daoist texts speak of *"the same origin with different names, known by few."* Laozi said: *"These two emerge together but differ in name; together they are called the Mysterious. The Mysterious of the Mysterious—this is the gateway to all wonders."* The sovereign fire is one Mystery; the people’s fire is another. When the two Mysteries unite, all wonders arise—this is what is meant by *"the gateway to all wonders."*

In antiquity, the Dao was the unifying principle: those among the people who possessed the Dao were honored as sovereigns. The sovereign fire and the people’s fire share a single source; yet within the postcelestial physical body, distinctions arise between sovereign and people, superior and inferior. The physical body regards the people’s fire as the treasure of life. *"The people are the root of the state; when the root is firm, the state is at peace."* Phrases such as *"The sovereign is light; the people are heavy"* (*Mencius·Jinxin II*) all convey the meaning of *"being intimate with the people"*—this is the learning that *"extends to destiny."*

The phrase *"In resting in perfect goodness"* is the foundational work of cultivating the Dao. *"Resting"* is the *zhi* of *zhi-guan* (cessation and contemplation); the character *"止"* is of utmost importance, while *"perfect goodness"* is the *"wondrous"* aspect of the Dao. The interdependence of heart-mind and breath is *"perfect goodness."* Goodness and evil arise in mutual opposition; *perfect goodness* transcends both good and evil, beyond all duality. This state is most difficult to describe: Daoists call it *"wondrous,"* Confucians call it *"perfect goodness,"* and Buddhists call it *"ineffable."* It is the heart-mind beyond the seven emotions, the consciousness beyond the six senses—heart-mind without heart-mind, intention without intention. The *Zhong Mei Xin Fa* describes this state within the ineffable, using analogies to clarify it most aptly.

*"Resting in perfect goodness"* refers to the heart-mind and breath, spirit and qi, uniting in the realm of perfect goodness, and to the cessation of thoughts and preservation of spirit in the state of perfect goodness. But where is this realm? What is *perfect goodness?* The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: *"Yan Hui’s character was such that upon grasping a single goodness, he would hold it fast in his bosom and never lose it."* *"A single goodness"* also conveys the meaning of *"perfect goodness"*—having attained it, one holds it fast and never loses it. The phrase *"holds fast in his bosom"* is even more dynamic than *"preserve."* *"Bosom"* refers to the *xuanying* (mysterious breast).

Where one clings tenaciously and holds fast in the bosom—that is the realm of perfect goodness, and it is also the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Thus, the heart-mind becomes still as water. The Buddhist tradition speaks of "cessation-and-contemplation" and "dual cultivation"; the Confucian calls it "knowing where to rest"; the Daoist terms it "contemplating the wondrous," "contemplating the aperture," or "contemplating the wondrous aperture"—all signify the meaning of "knowing where to rest." The practice of "cessation-and-contemplation in dual cultivation" is no different from the practice of "returning to emptiness." The *Great Learning* explains: *"Know where to rest, and thereafter there is stability; with stability comes tranquility; with tranquility comes serenity; with serenity comes reflection; with reflection comes attainment."* All that is described here pertains to the firing process. The realm of perfect goodness is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, and it is also the Gate of Dao and *yi*. Dao is emptiness, the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth; *yi* is qi—the vast, overflowing qi that arises from the accumulation of *yi*, which is the qi of utmost yang. The Gate of Dao and *yi* is the meaning of the mysterious yang. In Daoist texts, this is "gold within water," born of the accumulation of *yi*—thus, the two are one. The Gate of the Myriad Wonders is the realm of perfect goodness (note that "realm" and "realm/place" differ). *"To rest in perfect goodness"* means to still the heart-mind, to still the heart-mind in the realm of perfect goodness, where the realm is the state of the heart-mind. It is the manifestation of qi in resting upon perfect goodness, which is also the stilling of the heart-mind in emptiness. Within true emptiness there is wondrous existence, not dead emptiness—this is the realm of perfect goodness. The Buddha teaches: *"True emptiness does not obstruct wondrous existence; wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness."* This is the explanation of the realm of perfect goodness. When the mind is undistracted, a mass of misty qi coalesces without dispersing, yet not a single thought arises—this is the realm of perfect goodness, the moment when wondrous existence and true emptiness do not obstruct each other. When the heart-mind reaches this realm, it becomes the Gate of the Myriad Wonders, which cannot be attained at the initial stage of practice. Only when one has returned to emptiness and arrived at true intention can this be achieved. Not a single thought arises, yet the mind remains undistracted. If it is undistracted, how can no thought arise? When the *huozi* hour arrives before the aperture, the upright qi does not scatter, and the heart-mind remains empty of all things, yet in a state of primal chaos—seemingly existent, seemingly non-existent, between intention and non-intention. It is purely a mass of true intention, fully aware of the firing process yet knowing nothing else. When the *huowu* hour arrives, one naturally knows it, while all else becomes unknown. The four great elements are all empty, yet one easily falls into dead emptiness; if there is even a trace of intention, one becomes attached to forms as in ordinary days. Only by neither clinging to forms nor falling into emptiness can one attain the state where not a single thought arises and the mind remains undistracted—this is the Gate of the Myriad Wonders, the realm of perfect goodness. The realm of perfect goodness is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The mysterious yang and the female yin—yang is wondrous existence, yin is true emptiness. From true emptiness arises wondrous existence; when yang reaches its extreme, it becomes true emptiness, and when yin reaches its extreme, it becomes wondrous existence. Yet wondrous existence is true emptiness—all are the meaning of the Mysterious Female. "Mysterious" means unfathomably wondrous; "female" means boundlessly hollow. Only in boundless hollowness can the unfathomably wondrous transformations be born. Bai Yuchan said: *"Boundless hollowness is the mysterious aperture; knowing yet not clinging is the practice."* This is the practice of the elixir being born in the mysterious aperture. The great emptiness is boundlessly hollow, yet it cannot be clung to. The Classic states: *"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth."* Only the spirit of the empty valley does not die. The valley spirit is the wondrous emptiness; the wondrousness within emptiness is the valley spirit. Within the great and small voids, it is the gate through which one connects with emptiness. Every gate is the aperture in the middle, the gate of the valley spirit. Only this gate can gather the gates of the six senses, hence it is called the "root of Heaven and Earth." Exhaling connects with the root of Heaven; inhaling connects with the root of Earth. The breath of exhalation and inhalation enters and exits through the mouth and nose. Normally, this qi is not easily seen, but in winter, one can see the breath at the mouth. The two breaths of mouth and nose—one exhaling, one inhaling—are like Heaven and Earth. The mouth exhales, the nose inhales, one exiting, one entering, and their intersection is the crossroads, the root of Heaven and Earth. The natural Gate of the Mysterious Female lies within this. When heart-mind and breath interdepend, the two breaths of exhalation and inhalation naturally intersect here. The *Canticle* says: *"Square and round, a inch in diameter, blending and restraining each other."* It speaks of their intersection within the space of a square inch. To nurture the heart-mind with the realm of perfect goodness is to store this heart-mind at the Gate of the Mysterious Female, thereby resting in perfect goodness. This can be divided into two layers: first, emptying the heart-mind and resting it in the realm of perfect goodness, where knowing is the state of the heart-mind and resting is the realm. Empty the heart-mind and rest it in the realm of perfect goodness, and only then can there be stability. Stability means stabilizing in the One—the One being "a single goodness." Having attained it, one does not lose it, and thus follows the firing process of tranquility, serenity, reflection, and attainment. All occurs naturally, without the slightest contrivance. Eighth Lecture.

In the cultivation of the *Great Learning*, the workings of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, and the principles of human nature and destiny, the firing process is detailed through reflection, tranquility, serenity, and cessation. The previous lecture discussed the principle of the Five Phases, wherein the heavenly stems and earthly branches are all assigned to the Five Phases, which mutually give rise to and complete one another. In the prenatal Five Phases, they pertain to the transformation of *qi*, each possessing an independent nature; in the postnatal Five Phases, they pertain to the transformation of form, where the *qi* of the Five Phases is already complete, thus forming shapes. Therefore, within a single phase, the functions of all Five Phases are encompassed, a principle also adopted in the Dao of the Elixir.

Now, observing the earthly branches through the lens of the "Receiving Stems" (*na jia*), the Five Phases are truly one phase, and one phase is the Five Phases. Below is a diagram:

Wood is gestated in *you* (Metal) and attains growth in *hai* (Water). The *Zhen* trigram, both inner and outer, is Wood, which is gestated in Metal, hence *Zhen* receives *geng*, and *Xun* receives *xin*. Metal overcomes Wood, yet Wood uses Metal as its gestation—thus overcoming is also generating. Metal generates Water, and Water is Wood’s growth, where growth is gestation. Metal is gestated in *mao* and attains growth in *si*; the golden lotus within Fire is precisely this. *Ding* Fire and *ji* Earth combine to generate Metal, and the fifteenth day of the eighth month is when Metal is at its peak. Metal perishes in *yin* yet is gestated in *mao*, revealing that within Metal are Wood, Fire, and Earth, and within Wood are Metal, Water, and Earth.

The *Qian* trigram (Metal) receives *jia* and *ren*, where *jia* is *mao* Wood. The *Dui* trigram (Metal) receives *ding*, for Metal is born in *si*, which contains *ding* Fire and *ji* Earth. Earth comprises the four branches *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*; Earth is *Kun* and *Gen*, nurturing the myriad things. The *Yin Yi* (*Gui Cang*) begins with *Kun*, while the *Zhou* *Yi* of King Wen of Zhou begins with *Qian* and *Kun*. The *Lian Shan* begins with *Gen*, embodying the principle of "knowing cessation"; the *Gui Cang* begins with *Kun*, also taking *Kun*’s meaning of "completion at beginning and end," no different from beginning with *Qian* and *Kun*. *Chen* and *chou* mark the beginning, while *xu* and *wei* mark the end; only Earth does not perish, containing the Five Phases without exhaustion, serving as the primal *Kun* of the myriad things, receiving *yi* and *gui*. *Yi* is Wood, possessing the *qi* of ceaseless generation, embodying the principle of nurturing; *gui* is the end of the heavenly stems, embodying the principle of storage. Thus, *Kun* receives *yi* and *gui*, its meaning drawn from this.

Clearly, the Five Phases circulate without interruption. Now, considering *Kan* and *Li*: *Li* is Fire, gestated in *zi*, attaining growth in *yin*, flourishing in *wu*, and stored in *xu*. Within *yin* is *ji* Earth, and within *xu* is also *ji* Earth, hence *Li* receives *ji*. *Kan* is Water, gestated in *wu*, attaining growth in *shen*, flourishing in *zi*, and stored in *chen*. *Chen* Earth is *wu* Earth, and within *shen* is also *wu* Earth, hence *Kan* receives *wu*. The *ji* of *Li* and the *wu* of *Kan* arise from this.

*Li ji* is the radiance of the sun, wherein resides the Golden Crow, which is *you* Metal. *You* Metal is gestated in *mao* Wood, and *mao* Wood is Fire’s bathing, where Wood conceals Metal as Fire’s source. Thus, the Golden Crow dwells within the sun, taking *mao* as its bathing time. *Kan wu* is the essence of the moon, wherein resides the Jade Hare, which is *mao* Wood. *Mao* Wood is gestated in *you* Metal, and *you* Metal is Water’s bathing, where Metal conceals Wood as Water’s source. Thus, the Jade Hare dwells within the moon, taking *you* as its bathing time.

Observing Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal: Wood is gestated in *you* yet perishes in *shen*; Water is gestated in *wu* yet perishes in *si*; Metal is gestated in *mao* yet perishes in *yin*; Water is gestated in *zi* yet perishes in *hai*. Birth here is death here, revealing the principle of circulation. Only Earth does not perish; Earth is emptiness, and emptiness is neither born nor destroyed. From this, one may understand that the heavenly stems and earthly branches are mutually interconnected: within *zi* Water is *gui* Water, within *wu* Fire is *bing* Fire, within *si* Fire is *ding* Fire, and within *ji* Earth and *hai* Water are *ren* Water and *wu* Earth. The earthly branches arise from the heavenly stems, and the Five Phases of the earthly branches conceal the Five Phases of the heavenly stems—thus, one may be seen through the other. The principle of "Receiving Stems" cannot be easily understood without observing the heavenly stems and earthly branches together.

Within the Five Phases, Water begins and Metal ends, yet Metal generates Water, ending and beginning anew—this is the forward sequence. The central fifth is Earth, and five is one; thus, within Water is Metal, within Metal is Fire, within Fire is Wood, and within Wood is Water—this is the reverse creation. The forward sequence is the prenatal transforming into the postnatal; the reverse sequence is the postnatal returning to the prenatal. In terms of forward and reverse, the prenatal pertains to yang, and the postnatal pertains to yin. In terms of differentiation, the Five Phases each possess yin and yang, and each phase also has its own yin and yang, as in the *River Chart*, where even numbers are yin and odd numbers are yang.

Though the Dao of the Elixir involves the Five Phases, it is purely symbolic; what is employed is merely one yin and one yang, as the *Book of Changes* states: "One yin and one yang is called the Dao." In truth, yin and yang are also symbolic representations; in reality, they are but emptiness, the Supreme Ultimate. As previously stated, this is the Three, the Five, and the One. The so-called "Mysterious Female" (*xuan pin*) is the mysterious Heaven and the receptive Earth; the mysterious yang and the receptive yin; the mysterious "having" and the receptive "not-having." Receiving the mandate of Heaven, the nature of *Qian* Metal is the mysterious; the prenatal within the postnatal, the mandate of *Kun* Earth is the receptive. Separated, they are Heaven and Earth, *Qian* and *Kun*; united, they are the undifferentiated.

The Gate of the Mysterious Female (*xuan pin*) is the Gate of Primordial Chaos (*hundun*). At the threshold where *Qian* and *Kun* unite, where yin and yang intersect, only then does Primordial Chaos form. This locus of Primordial Chaos is the Gate of Primordial Chaos, which is also the Gate of the Mysterious Female—it may further be called the "Realm of Supreme Good." The initial step lies in "knowing where to halt" (*zhi zhi*); "knowing" is awakening, and within it lies the work of *huohou* (timing and effort). With a mind of purity, one halts at this locus—only then is it the mind of "knowing where to halt." This "halt" is but a faint awakening, free from attachment to the forms of "having" or "not-having."

As *Zhuangzi* states: *"Let the mind wander in simplicity, blend the qi with vastness."* Simplicity (*dan*) is the realm of detachment, merging with emptiness. The character *dan* (淡) combines water on the left and fire on the right—only where water and fire meet can they intersect, the small emptiness uniting with the great emptiness. Both *dan* (淡) and *mo* (漠) denote boundlessness; one should let the mind wander therein and blend the qi therewith. Indeed, Zhuangzi’s words express the principle of "returning to emptiness" (*huan xu*), which is also the meaning of "knowing where to halt." The "Supreme Good" and "detachment" share the same essence.

The passage in the *Great Learning*—*"Know where to halt, and there will be stability; with stability, there will be tranquility; with tranquility, there will be peace; with peace, there will be contemplation; with contemplation, there will be attainment"*—is the *huohou* work of "halting at the Supreme Good," the esoteric transmission of the Sage’s gate, nothing more. This passage meticulously describes the stages of *huohou*; the entire process of Dao cultivation is encapsulated in these few lines. The so-called "knowing where to halt" is to halt at the Supreme Good through the divine awareness of innate knowledge (*liangzhi*). Innate knowledge arises naturally from awakening; for those in the postnatal state, the slightest stir of awareness becomes innate knowledge. Initially, there is no "divine awareness," only ordinary perception. Divine awareness is the awakening of non-awakening—spontaneous, untouched by the slightest intention, vague and indistinct, without a clear mind, quiescent yet responsive, utterly empty and numinous, perfectly round and luminous, arising without knowing why.

If it is mere perception, then awareness stirs and knowledge arises. For those in the postnatal state, the *shen* (discerning spirit) dominates, and the mind’s discriminating power is active—thus awareness is not numinous, and movement immediately flows into knowledge. Comparing the two, divine awareness is exceedingly light, while perception is slightly heavier; divine awareness arises purely from the celestial harmony, whereas perception is tainted by intellect. At the outset of entering the Dao, when the mind is not yet clear and the nature not yet manifest, those who nurture and employ it well may preserve the faint awakening of innate knowledge, preventing it from flowing into the realm of intellect—thus achieving sincerity. If one remains as restless as a monkey or horse, the moment awareness stirs, intellect intrudes, and even the lightest, faintest perception becomes unattainable—how much less can innate knowledge be preserved!

Only through practice does one draw near. The two characters "refining the self" (*lian ji*) are of utmost importance. Through diligent refinement, one naturally sheds the power of intellect and restores innate knowledge. Herein lies the work of "knowing where to halt"! To "know where to halt" is to halt at the realm of innate knowledge; and with this innate knowledge, to halt at the Realm of Supreme Good. The so-called "halt" is to halt the mind from flowing into thoughts, to halt knowledge from flowing into intellect. Only this thought-free, intellect-free innate knowledge is the pure mind—unattached to the four forms, unabiding in form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma—this is what is meant by *"letting the mind wander in simplicity."*

With this innate knowledge, *"blend the qi with vastness"*—vastness (*mo*) is emptiness, the Realm of Supreme Good, the Gate of the Mysterious Female. To halt innate knowledge here is to unite spirit and qi, to interdepend mind and breath, to guard the center and embrace the One, to refine the self and return to emptiness—this is the initial work of practice.

As the *Book of Changes* states: *"To preserve and sustain the nature is the gate of Dao and virtue."* *"Letting the mind wander in simplicity"* is the Dao; *"blending the qi with vastness"* is virtue. *Mencius* says: *"That which is born of accumulated virtue is so great and firm that it fills the space between Heaven and Earth."* Is not "the space between Heaven and Earth" the Dao? Is not "that which is born of accumulated virtue" virtue? Thus, the gate of Dao and virtue is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The "nature" (*xing*) here is the already-manifest nature; to preserve this nature, one must preserve it at the "gate of Dao and virtue." This is the moment when innate knowledge returns to divine awareness.

To "know where to halt at the Supreme Good" is merely to know where to halt, to receive the Sage’s esoteric transmission—yet the subtleties of *huohou* are not yet detailed. Proceeding from this point, following the mind’s method, one engages in the work of refining the self and returning to emptiness. When spirit and qi interdepend, this is called "stability" (*ding*). Stability is stability in the One—the One is the Realm of Supreme Good, the Gate of the Mysterious Female; the One is non-duality in things, the unfathomable source of life; the One is the Supreme Ultimate, the center, true emptiness. To stabilize within true emptiness is the first step in practice. The Dao calls it "cultivating stability" (*xiu ding*); Buddhism calls it "entering stability" (*ru ding*)—both are the same.

Thus it is said: *"Know where to halt, and there will be stability."* Yet stability, whether for a moment or an instant, is still called "stability." Stability may be momentary but not enduring, singular but not expansive—it still cannot grasp the transformative power. One must progress from stability to tranquility.

Tranquility is the initial stage of refining the fire of returning to emptiness, wherein body and mind are both purified. Compared to "stability," it endures longer and can embrace vastness, possessing a capacity for gradual expansion. To sit upright in non-action is called "tranquility"; when the heart-mind of the sovereign is at peace, this is called "tranquility." To forget the self, forget others, forget form, forget things—this is called "tranquility." To be without deliberation, without insistence, without fixation, without self—this is called "tranquility." When the four great elements remain unmoved, the body is tranquil; when the six gates do not open, the mind is tranquil; when the seven emotions do not arise, intention is tranquil. When the mind does not move, spirit is tranquil; when the body does not move, qi is tranquil; when intention does not move, essence is tranquil. Tranquility is like still water without ripples, like a mirror that clarifies itself.

The secret says: When body and mind are pure and tranquil, spirit and qi harmonize, merging into chaos, profound and obscure—unaware of heaven as a canopy or earth as a chariot; unaware of the self possessing a body, or the body possessing the Dao. This is called "utter emptiness and profound tranquility." When practice reaches this point, the first yang is about to transform. Yet for a beginner progressing from stability to tranquility, this must initially involve effort, and the spontaneous awakening of spirit cannot yet be attained. Thus, the four characters "utter emptiness and profound tranquility" are difficult to achieve. Compared to the initial stage of stability, however, the duration is longer, and distracting thoughts may cease for a time. If during stability one can remain thought-free for a quarter-hour, during tranquility one may do so for an hour. In stability, body and mind cannot yet be forgotten, but in tranquility, one enters the state of having no mind—hence it is said, "from stability one can attain tranquility."

What is called "from tranquility one can attain ease" arises from the pure and tranquil body and mind, which awaken the natural spiritual awareness. This natural spiritual awareness, as previously mentioned, is the inherent luminous clarity of the original nature. This nature is the primordial spirit (*yuan shen*) emanating from the ancestral nature, outwardly chaotic yet inwardly luminous and empty, first true emptiness and then wondrous existence. Buddhism calls it "right awakening Buddha-nature" or "perfectly awakened wondrous mind"; Confucianism calls it "the Dao-mind of the Supreme Ultimate" or "the mind of heaven and earth"; Daoism calls it "the awakened primordial spirit" or "the luminous true nature." The sages of the Three Teachings all describe it with the words "center" and "One." Daoist texts say, "Within the center there is the One; within the One there is the center." Zisi called it "attaining the mean and harmony" (*Zhongyong*): when quiescent and unmoving, it is the "mean"; when stimulated, it penetrates—this is "harmony." If the mean is attained before expression, expression will be harmonious; if the mean is attained during expression, harmony will follow. Without this mean, expression cannot be harmonious. This is a natural matter, not governed by the human mind, yet this spiritual awareness naturally governs. Invisibly, it suddenly becomes aware.

In the work of refining the fire, only this spiritual awareness can spontaneously operate, spontaneously regulate, moving when it should move and halting when it should halt. Not only this—even the movement and stillness of primordial qi follow this spiritual awareness; the generation and transformation of primordial essence are also governed by it. Naturally interdependent, naturally harmonious, naturally congealing, naturally gathering—no effort is required to sustain it. Thus *Laozi* says, "The Dao models itself on spontaneity," and *Wuzhen pian* says, "There is a natural true fire, needing no kindling or fanning."

Yet how does spiritual awareness arise? Only by completely eliminating the human mind, eradicating worldly desires, not generating a single thought, and maintaining utmost sincerity and focus—pure true emptiness, without the appearances of self, others, things, or form—will spiritual awareness spontaneously arise. Daoist texts also call this "true intention," meaning "a single undistracted intention." When true intention activates, it is wondrous existence; when it does not move, it is true emptiness, identical in substance to the great void and identical in function to the Supreme Ultimate—hence it is called "prior to heaven." At the initial stirring of spiritual awareness, it is in the state of prior-heaven, chaotic and undifferentiated, without the slightest impurity—thus it is also called "chaotic primordial spirit," "right and equal awakening," or "prior to heaven, yet heaven does not oppose it." Once activated, it governs essence and qi, regulates the fire, forgets form and body, and naturally aligns with the Dao—without the slightest involvement of the discriminating mind. Thus it is also called "perfectly awakened wondrous mind," "luminous spirit," or "posterior to heaven, yet following heaven's timing." At this stage, it is called "ease."

Ease is being at peace and at liberty, as in Emperor Yao’s "peaceful peace." Confucius said: "Some act from ease, some from advantage, some from effort" (*Zhongyong*), and also: "Those who know from birth are the highest; those who know through learning are next; those who learn through difficulty are lower still" (*Analects*). When one begins practice, letting go of all concerns and eliminating the discriminating mind, one stabilizes the mind in a state of purity to seek the innate knowing within the original nature. Using this innate knowing to halt at the gate of the Dao is firm indeed. Yet initially, this halting is largely forced. Forcing stability within emptiness lasts but a moment—an instant later, the discriminating mind returns, the mind is impure, and innate knowing vanishes. The body is constrained, qi is not tranquil, and true emptiness is lost—hence it is "momentary but not enduring."

Daily, one must forcefully persist in practice, learning through struggle. Gradually, progress accumulates—first stabilizing for a single minute, then after several days, two minutes, then five, then ten. Through months and years of accumulation, one reaches the state where both body and mind are tranquil, and this is "acting from advantage," "knowing through learning," and "stabilizing before attaining stillness." Yet at this stage, though the body is still, it has not yet reached steadfastness; though the mind is empty, it has not yet reached its utmost. Though one may attain stillness for a time, this stillness still relies on the effort of halting thoughts. It is merely that the discriminating mind is unified and deluded intentions are sincere—one has not yet arrived at the realm of utmost sincerity, and the natural spiritual awareness has not returned.

One must persist day and night, in movement and stillness, walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, refining the mind as before, so that body and mind merge into great stability and profound stillness, forgetting both inner and outer. Mind and form are transformed together; things come and one responds naturally, affairs pass and one ceases. The spirit is not pulled by intellect, qi is not driven by emotions, and intention is not bound by dharmas. Through long practice, when this becomes thoroughly familiar, innate knowing and innate ability are present at every moment. This is the process of "reducing again and again," dissolving the discriminating mind until the original spirit takes charge.

Yet when the original spirit first returns, the mind is like that of an infant—entering chaos but not yet luminous, possessing natural truth but unable to wield it. This may be called "acting from smoothness," but not yet "acting from ease." *Mencius* says: "The great person is one who does not lose the heart of an infant." *The Announcement of Kang* states: "As in protecting an infant, the heart sincerely seeks it." For once attained, it must not be lost. One must preserve it all day, never parting from it for even a moment. Confucius said of Yan Hui: "In grasping one good, he held it fast in his breast and never lost it." This single good is "the One that is spirit." In constant quiescent illumination, profoundly clear and bright, through long accumulation and deep familiarity, the original spirit expands, evolving from chaos to luminous clarity. Naturally, it governs the firing times, giving rise to transformation—no need to refine the mind, for the mind refines itself; no need to concentrate the spirit, for the spirit concentrates itself; no need to regulate the breath, for the breath regulates itself, and qi moves of its own accord. Moreover, advancing and retreating are in perfect measure; when the time comes, the spirit knows. As the living *zi* hour arrives, the spirit is already outwardly stabilized; as the living *wu* hour approaches, qi has already inwardly returned. Body and mind are in non-doing, yet spirit and qi naturally act. As *Laozi* says: "In non-doing, nothing is left undone." The pure yang stage, "simply resting the spirit and breath, entrusting to nature," is the same. This is called "acting from ease," requiring no effort of one’s own, yet in the unseen, spiritual awareness naturally adjusts the firing times—akin to "knowing from birth." This is "those who know from birth are the highest."

Yet where in the world are those who "know from birth"? Even the sagely Confucius sought the Dao from Laozi; even the enlightened Śākyamuni received instruction from Dipamkara. Even if there are those born able to speak or write, once they enter the *sahā* world, intellect awakens and the original spirit recedes, desires encroach and innate knowing fades—how could they practice the Dao without learning? One must proceed from knowing where to halt, to stabilizing, to stilling, and only then reach "ease within ease." When the mind is clear and nature is revealed, spiritual awareness presides over the work of self-cultivation, requiring no physical effort or acquired intellect. Only when suddenly penetrating and connecting all does one become a "sage who knows from birth." The Dao of self-cultivation, the learning of the great person, moves from effort to ease, from subtlety to transformation.

Thus, "ease" means that spiritual awareness presides over all. Therefore, in gathering, sealing, and refining the firing times, all arises naturally—when stability is due, one stabilizes; when forgetting is due, one forgets. Within chaos and emptiness, infinite transformations emerge. This "ease" is the true efficacy of refining the self. Yet without the return of the original spirit, there can be no ease. Only after attaining ease does one "sleep and wake with the spirit embraced, ever aware of its presence or absence," unbroken and continuous, deeply rooted and firmly established. Natural transformation then arises. At the extreme of emptiness, being arises from non-being; at the utmost of stillness, the yang returns. External stimuli and internal responses, medicine is produced and the spirit knows. Gathering with the gathering that is not gathering, neither assisting nor forgetting; taking with the taking that is not taking, naturally withdrawing and replenishing. In the state of not knowing or perceiving, lead and mercury are already harmonized, the great medicine returns to the furnace, yang fire advances of itself, and yin tally naturally appears.

When practice reaches the stage of ease, the practitioner must carefully observe and truly embody it, never growing negligent—hence it is said, "only after stilling can one attain ease." As for "only after attaining ease can one deliberate," this concerns guarding against danger and considering risks. This "deliberation" is rarely understood through the ages. The Song Confucians, not knowing the Dao, need not be discussed; even Daoists seldom offer a proper interpretation of this phrase. For when practice reaches "acting from ease," natural spiritual awareness has already awakened, the light of nature shines forth, the mind of Dao emerges, and the great medicine can be generated, gathered, sealed, and refined—what need is there for deliberation? Moreover, deliberation pertains to the mind of the future, belonging to the discriminating mind. At this stage, the original spirit is in charge—how could there be a "mind of the future"? The success or failure of the Dao, the attainment or loss of the elixir, hinges entirely on this word.

The *Book of Songs* states: "Only this King Wen, cautious and reverent" (see *Records of Rites·Biao Ji*). Confucius said: "As if treading on thin ice, as if standing by a deep abyss" (see *Analects·Tai Bo*). *Awakening to Reality* warns: "In drawing and adding, guard against danger," and further: "A deviation of a hair’s breadth fails to form the elixir."

When transitioning from stillness to ease, the true medicine arises in the heart, and the body likewise generates transformation. The natural fire-phase requires no human effort; the four limbs relax, soft as cotton. At first encountering this scene, scholars cannot but rejoice exceedingly. Yet this very joy may allow the discriminating spirit to seize the moment and invade, with worldly desires returning—thus the natural spiritual awareness, once gained, may be lost again. This is the first concern.

Moreover, even if spiritual awareness is regained and the great medicine produced, with wondrous scenes before one, sudden terror may arise, allowing the discriminating spirit to invade once more, transmuting the primordial into the conditioned. This is the second concern.

Further, when the primordial spirit has awakened and the gathering is complete, one may grow complacent, believing it sufficient. Then, indulging body and mind, unable to forget emotions amid circumstances—or practicing for days and deeming it mastery—one slackens in vigilance, inviting the discriminating spirit’s will. The moment it stirs, true intention and primordial spirit are lost, the effect immediate, the thought already awry. This is the third concern. The ancients called this "lead flying, mercury fleeing," "the cauldron breaking, the furnace collapsing." All these are dangers at the moment of gathering the medicine, yet they remain relatively easy to correct.

When natural spiritual awareness has returned, attained within quiescent stability, and one proceeds calmly with the fire-phase—gathering, sealing, obtaining the medicine, forming the elixir, completing the celestial cycle—when the inner elixir has coalesced and the fetal immortal may dance, the practitioner has reached this stage with cultivation refined and foundation firmly laid. Yet even here, in the work of gentle nurturing and bathing, one must guard against danger and consider risks. Otherwise, all prior efforts may be undone, or madness and illness may arise—this "deliberation" demands even greater emphasis.

Why? During gentle nurturing, success depends entirely on harmonizing water and fire to achieve the "already crossed" effect, morning in *Tun*, evening in *Meng*, taking the two hexagrams as images. The classics state: "At dawn, guard against dryness, use water to augment the lead; at dusk, guard against cold, use fire to replenish the mercury." At all times, one must contain light in silence, as if present yet absent, like a dragon nurturing its pearl, a hen brooding her egg, wholly returning to the state of the Great Ultimate. Should the measure deviate even slightly, regret and misfortune arise. The *Yi Jing*’s *Qian* hexagram, line nine-three—"All day long, *qian qian*, reverting and repeating the Dao"—depicts this very image. Without such meticulous sincerity, one cannot attain the image of "the flying dragon in the heavens, meeting the noble person."

The alchemical classics speak of "a year’s bathing, guarding against danger," and *The Mirror of Ingredient Entry* states: "Only with utmost sincerity does the method follow nature." Should there be even a single day of unnaturalness, a single moment of insincerity, the elixir is destroyed. Moreover, external worldly desires and internal dharmic appearances, should delusive thoughts arise, give rise to demonic obstacles. Though the discriminating spirit has been subdued, its roots remain unsevered. Not until completing the seven-day celestial cycle can the nature of food, sex, temperament, the six senses, and seven emotions be fully extinguished. During this period of gentle nurturing, karmic roots from past kalpas and lifelong worldly desires surge against the heart-mind like tides. Only by concentrating the spirit, stabilizing the will, forgetting self and others, practicing solitary vigilance, and preserving the natural fire-phase of spiritual awareness with utmost care can one ensure safety.

Moreover, at every step of this process, scenes arise and images appear. One must face scenes without attachment, perceive images without clinging to forms—only then can water and fire achieve balance. Thus this "deliberation" is not the deliberation of thought but a crucial principle within the fire-phase. Only by deliberating beforehand can one attain ease afterward; only by deliberating thoroughly can one achieve perfect ease.

Some may question whether "deliberation" should precede "ease," or whether it should persist throughout as a constant vigil. Yet if the work does not aspire to ease, there is nothing to deliberate. To deliberate is to guard against forgetting danger in ease, to guard against failing in sincerity, to guard against inability to calm the spirit and rest in naturalness, to guard against using wisdom when it arises rather than containing and expanding it. All these pertain to the stage after the primordial spirit has taken charge and governs the fire-phase. Before the discriminating spirit is transformed, there is no Dao to cultivate, no elixir to nurture, no wisdom to arise, no naturalness to follow.

Only after first restoring the heart of the infant does spiritual awareness take form; with spiritual awareness formed, the natural fire-phase emerges. Following this naturalness is called utmost sincerity, enabling one to reach the state of unceasing breath and fully recover the original face before father and mother were born. This is the primordial Great Dao, the supreme vehicle, purely a scene of the primordial. Only then can the cosmos settle in tranquility and wisdom’s light arise; with wisdom’s light arisen, sagehood and wisdom are complete.

Yet the distinction between primordial and conditioned lies in the subtlety between being and non-being. When being and non-being are not established, it is the primordial; otherwise, one falls into the conditioned. Thus, should a single thought stir in the heart or the slightest form attach to the body, the restored primordial true yang instantly transforms into conditioned turbid yin, becoming unusable. Before spiritual awareness is attained, this primordial state does not exist, and the fire-phase cannot proceed. While the discriminating spirit remains unexhausted, wisdom’s light does not arise.

When practice reaches a state of serene ease, the numinous clarity within one’s nature gradually begins to manifest—such as divine perception, knowledge of others’ minds, recollection of past lives, celestial vision, celestial hearing, and the like—all arising during the nurturing and nursing phase of cultivation. If wisdom is employed as soon as it first emerges, it transforms into discriminating consciousness; only by not employing wisdom does one succeed in transmuting consciousness into true wisdom. Moreover, the initial appearance of spiritual awareness is inherently natural; following this naturalness, awareness becomes ever more numinous, but if naturalness is lost, spiritual awareness departs. This is why I name it “natural spiritual awareness.” This subtlety is so fine that a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to a thousand *li* of error. The *Book of Changes* states: “To know the incipient is to be divine!” And again: “The divine is that which subtly pervades all things.” The mechanism of naturalness is the celestial mechanism, the workings of creation. The wise perceive its incipient signs and follow them—hence the saying, “Only when at peace can one deliberate.” As for “deliberation leading to attainment,” it is said: “All day long, ceaselessly vigilant, as if facing peril at dusk—then there will be no blame.” Thus one may attain the elixir and accomplish the Dao.

Attainment is an attainment that endures forever; if it is not everlasting, it cannot be called “attainment”—it is what Buddhism terms the “cessation of all defilements” or “nirvana without remainder.” Only when the discriminating spirit is utterly extinguished, the hun and po dissolved and transformed, the Dharma-body pervading the three realms, and one’s original nature filling the void—only then, free from rebirth and coeval with heaven, indestructible even when heaven and earth crumble—can it truly be called “attainment.” Buddhism calls this “completion,” Daoism calls it “accomplishment.” It is not the attainment of some transient gain, nor the recovery of the original spirit, nor the attainment achieved through stillness, concentration, or tranquility. One must guard against danger, deliberate over peril, exhaust principle and fulfill one’s nature to the point where no danger remains to guard against, no loss to deliberate over. The *Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Scripture* says: “Once attained, it is attained forever, and the body naturally becomes light. Supreme harmony overflows, and the bones scatter like cold jade.” The *Scripture of Purity* states: “This is called attaining the Dao.” Chen Nidan says: “It takes but a moment’s effort to enjoy endless ease forever.” All these serve as proofs of the word “attainment.” The Buddhist sutras speak of “turning the mechanism in an instant to return to one’s original attainment,” referring to those who awaken suddenly and fully—akin to the meaning of “Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die content in the evening.”

Earlier, “illuminating virtue” was identified as the Dao, the elixir, the medicine; “renewing the people” as the practice; and “utmost goodness” as the wondrous aperture. In this passage, through the successive practices of settling, stillness, tranquility, and deliberation, the Dao is assuredly attained. Bai Yuchan said: “Since receiving the oral instructions from my teacher, I have known that this elixir can certainly be attained and this Dao can certainly be accomplished. Though the various fire-phases may seem intricate and difficult to observe, in practice they are exceedingly simple.” Throughout, it is all a matter of naturalness, with sincerity as the unbroken thread. Cultivating this to the point of utmost sincerity without cease, one gradually gains numinous penetrations—hence the saying, “Deliberation leads to attainment.”

In my view, the opening passage on the Dao of the *Great Learning* seems to be the words of Confucius, while this passage detailing the practice is likely the teaching of Zengzi. These two sections alone have exhaustively expounded the great Dao of the golden elixir and the supreme vehicle of Chan. The Song Confucians, not understanding the Dao, merely provided exegetical glosses and thus missed the mark by a wide margin.

The following four phrases—“Things have their roots and branches”—are especially profound and flavorful. They mean that for those who cultivate the Dao, knowing the roots and branches, beginnings and ends, prior and posterior—these six aspects—brings one close to the Dao. All things have roots before branches; the Dao is the root. Knowing the root of the primordial qi, one naturally understands how the Dao constitutes the Dao. Cultivating the body by seeking the beginning from the end is reversal; worldly affairs proceed from root to branch in sequence. Seeking the Dao through reversal, knowing that nothing exists after death, one also knows that emptiness preceded birth. Through reverse cultivation and return, the Dao is found within. The use of “end” before “beginning” carries deep significance. “Knowing what comes first and what follows” is to know the source of the primordial and the conditioned. The *Book of Changes* says: “Preceding heaven, do not oppose it; following heaven, comply with its timing.” The primordial is the source of the Dao; the conditioned is the beginning of transformation. The common people, unaware, follow the conditioned forms of change in their daily lives; the sages investigate things and exhaust principles to explore the primordial origin. “Knowing what comes first and what follows” is the principle of “illuminating luminous virtue” and “resting in utmost goodness.”

The Dao of the great person begins with returning to emptiness and ends with returning to emptiness; end and beginning are one and the same. To know beginning and end is to know that both are matters of returning to emptiness—thus one knows the Dao. The Dao of the *Great Learning* is the Dao of the great person, and this “great person” is the “great person” of the *Book of Changes*. Later generations, not understanding, misinterpreted this—hence the obscurity of Confucianism and Daoism.

“Those in ancient times who wished to illuminate luminous virtue” first “ordered their states”—the state being the body, as the ancients always used the body as a metaphor for the state. To order the state, one must first regulate the family, for the family is a small state. To regulate the family, one must first cultivate the body. The essence of cultivating the body lies in the heart. Only when the original spirit presides over affairs is the heart rectified. Rectifying the heart begins with sincerity of intention, and sincerity of intention is true intention. With this true intention, one can wield its subtlety, and natural spiritual awareness gradually becomes numinous. Only this spiritual awareness can discern the fire-phases of the living zi and living wu, and employ the practices of ninefold return and sevenfold reversal.

Thus, in cultivating the Dao, one must first restore true intention. To restore true intention, one must first extract awareness from the acquired spirit and discard its knowledge, hence the saying, “To make intention sincere, first extend one’s knowledge.” The word “extend” (*zhi*) carries profound meaning—it signifies “to reach,” “to employ,” and also conveys the sense of singular focus. Only what can be reached is called “extended,” and what is inherently so is called “extended.” Concentrating the mind with unwavering resolve marks the beginning of sincerity; utmost sincerity and single-minded density mark its culmination. Thus, sincerity is also called “one-pointed sincerity,” and sincere intention is synonymous with utmost sincerity. When the mind is undistracted, dwelling solely on this single point, sincerity arises over time. Sincerity is the genuine, singular, and unwavering thought that arises from intention. Human intention is inherently true and thus inherently sincere, but it is disturbed by knowledge and invaded by material desires, giving rise to deluded thoughts and wayward impulses. All these stem from the acquired spirit governing affairs, as external temptations enter through the six gates and directly engage the six senses, activating the six consciousnesses. This further stirs wayward fire and arouses the seven emotions, creating an unbroken stream of thoughts that leaves the tranquil heart-monarch restless and the primal spirit deeply concealed and unseen. It is like clouds and mist obscuring the sky, hiding the sun and moon—yet the sun and moon remain inherently present. The acquired spirit wreaks havoc, veiling the primal spirit; deluded intentions run rampant, while true intention lies hidden, though not absent.

To “extend one’s knowledge” is to return to the innate good knowledge within the primal spirit; to “make intention sincere” is to awaken the true intention within the heart’s nature. The words “sincere” and “extend” both refer to what is inherently possessed, requiring only refinement—dispelling clouds and mist to reveal the sun and moon. The phrase “extending knowledge lies in investigating things” further clarifies that the awakening of good knowledge depends on the word “investigate” (*ge*). To investigate is to eliminate what is not the heart. As *Mencius* states, “Only a great person can rectify the ruler’s heart’s errors” (*Mencius·Li Lou I*). “Things” refer to entities with form; separating from all forms, the heart investigates itself—not merely targeting material desires, but akin in meaning to “overcoming the self and returning to propriety” and “the world returning to benevolence” (*Analects·Yan Yuan*). For the Dao-heart is subtle, while the human heart is perilous. The human heart is the heart attached to the four forms and six consciousnesses, driven by desire for existence. The Dao-heart is the heart’s original substance, empty yet luminous, simultaneously form and emptiness. People generate deluded thoughts through emotions and consciousness, and from deluded thoughts arise cravings. Thus, external objects become obstructions within the heart. Unaware that the physical body is a superfluous growth, they daily scheme to nourish it, allowing the acquired nature of food, sex, and temperament to usurp the primal spirit’s position as master of body and mind. Not only is good knowledge submerged and irretrievable, but even the formless awareness, when active, carries the roots of consciousness, instantly slipping into the realm of knowledge. This is not a sudden occurrence but a gradual accumulation.

The path of self-cultivation must begin here, gradually habituating oneself to eliminate knowledge and restore the heart’s originally spontaneous awareness. From this awareness, good knowledge accumulates, making its attainment certain—hence the saying, “Extending knowledge lies in investigating things.” The word “lies” (*zai*) is heavily emphasized, marking an essential stage for scholars. The term “investigating things” has broad implications, encompassing the exploration of yin-yang principles and the origins of creation. Why do all things in the universe come into being? Why do they perish? Each is investigated according to its natural nature. Knowing that the principles of generation and transformation in all things each possess their own inherent pattern, none deviating from the natural norm, the meaning of “illuminating luminous virtue” becomes fully manifest in the world. The ancients took the Dao as their unifying principle; the heart-to-heart transmission of Yao and Shun was this lineage, fundamentally embracing the world as public. Thus, to “illuminate luminous virtue throughout the world,” one must begin with investigating things to restore good knowledge. Only when good knowledge is returned does the hope of sudden penetration arise. Then, extending it to the six directions or withdrawing it into formlessness, participating in heaven and earth to nurture all things—none but the good knowledge sharing the same substance with “luminous virtue” can achieve this.

The following passage, “Only after things are investigated is knowledge extended,” reiterates the preceding meaning. “From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all must take self-cultivation as their foundation”—self-cultivation is the learning of the great person. Only after this learning is complete can one govern. The weight of the Dao’s lineage throughout history is evident here. The phrase “when the root is disordered, the branches cannot be ordered” means that scholars must start from the root. Though the branches may number in the thousands or tens of thousands, their root ultimately converges in one. Understanding the function of “illuminating luminous virtue” reveals that all things emerge from this. By grasping the essential to encompass the vast, governing the world becomes as effortless as pointing to one’s palm. If one abandons the root to chase the branches, busying oneself daily with tangible things, one only stirs the acquired spirit’s disturbances—yielding no benefit and causing harm.

“Thickness” and “thinness” relate to “investigating things.” If one is thick toward material desires, the primal spirit becomes thin and vanishes. Thinness means detachment; “letting the mind wander in detachment” expresses this idea. By thinning material desires—from thick to thin to complete elimination—the work of investigating things is accomplished.

"Daily renewal, ever renewed" expresses the meaning of "daily renewing one’s virtue." Human life, long accustomed to the acquired spirit, may discard it to employ the primal spirit—this is shedding the old to embrace the new. The *Book of Changes* speaks of "abolishing the old and establishing the new" (see *Zagua*), meaning to discard the old and open the new cauldron, setting up the furnace and establishing the tripod—the tripod being the primal spirit. Only by eliminating material desires and maintaining unceasing sincerity can the tripod be formed and the primal spirit return. "Daily" signifies layer upon layer of renewal.

"Brilliantly manifesting the lofty virtue": *lofty* means stern, elevated, majestic and profound, akin to the Daoist notion of "supremely great and deep," "abyssal and unfathomable," also termed "supremely great and firm"—hence *lofty*. "The noble person leaves nothing unexhausted in their pursuit": only when the work of investigating things reaches its utmost does true knowledge arise; only when knowledge is fully realized does the primal spirit return. Moreover, extreme movement gives rise to stillness, and extreme stillness gives rise to movement—only at the extreme can creation and transformation be generated, like the cyclic movement and stillness of the Supreme Ultimate.

Human life’s fortunes and misfortunes never depart from the Supreme Ultimate; cultivating the Dao aims to reverse the flow and return to the Supreme Ultimate. Benevolence, reverence, filial piety, compassion, and trust constitute the Five Phases, which are human nature. Aligning them with the Five Phases, benevolence corresponds to Wood, reverence to Fire, filial piety to Metal, compassion to Water, and trust to Earth. Those who study the Dao must "reduce and further reduce," first diminishing before gaining benefit—hence the saying "like cutting, like filing." For the acquired spirit must be investigated and discarded, reduced and further reduced. When the acquired spirit departs, the primal spirit returns; first diminishing, then gaining benefit—this also requires "like carving, like polishing," like sculpting jade into an implement, gradually refining it to completion.

"Sincerity" and "dignified bearing" manifest externally. The noble person studying the Dao must outwardly cultivate dignified bearing while inwardly maintaining vigilance and caution. The "modest noble person," guarding themselves with trembling caution, only then attains "abundant virtue and utmost goodness," so that the people turn to them and "cannot forget." "Abundant virtue" is "luminous virtue"; *luminous* and *abundant* both denote the finest.

Every human being should cultivate the Dao. The fundamental golden nature is universally possessed; with prolonged effort, one can naturally return to it—hence the saying "not forgotten even in death." "What is meant by making one’s intentions sincere is not deceiving oneself." The seven emotions and six desires all constitute self-deception. The original substance of the human mind is quiescent and unmoving, yet material desires entice it, constantly drawing it outward. Movement induced by external enticement is called "self-deception." Sincerity lies in not deceiving oneself; when deceitful thoughts depart, material desires can be eliminated. "Not deceiving oneself" begins with "vigilance in solitude"—*solitude* means standing alone. Being unwavering in one’s devotion to things is to be solitary and unified—unity is the true intention of the primal spirit. Only by being unwavering in devotion to things can one generate the unfathomable; if it is the acquired spirit, it is manifold and incorrect.

The "noble person" is the noble person who studies the Dao; only upon achieving the Dao does one become a great noble person. In guarding solitude for oneself, *solitude* is the "One" in "One and numinous"—*One* is emptiness. Vigilance in solitude preserves the primal spirit and strictly prevents the intrusion of material desires, hence Master Zeng said: "Watched by ten eyes, pointed at by ten fingers." For vigilance is paramount. "Ten" refers to "eyes watching," "ten" to "fingers pointing"—the word "ten" should mark the pause. "Watching" is stillness, while "pointing" is movement. Only when movement and stillness do not depart from the state of "ten" can the mind be expansive—*expansive* means vast and empty. Only with an "expansive mind" can one attain "embodied ease," manifesting as a radiant countenance and comfortable limbs. What the *Book of Changes* calls "beauty within" is the "expansive mind"; "extending to the four limbs" is "embodied ease." Not being harmed by material desires, due to discarding the acquired spirit and maintaining vigilance in solitude, sincerity within naturally manifests without—this is inevitable.

Yet to what degree must material desires be eliminated? *Mencius* said: "The great person does not lose their childlike heart." A *child* refers to a small child under three years old; above three is a *child*, under one is an *infant*. A heart like a child’s is free from material desires and empty of things—this is the great person. To not lose the childlike heart, to have a heart like a child’s, is to have already made one’s intentions sincere. The *Kang Gao* states: "Cherish the childlike heart, seek it with sincerity." The child’s heart is single-minded, without duplicity; seeking it with sincerity, one attains it.

The function of "sincerity" is vast—ascending to become a Buddha or an immortal, all rely on sincerity. The *Doctrine of the Mean* discusses "sincerity" most extensively: "Sincerity is enlightenment, and enlightenment is sincerity." "From sincerity to enlightenment is called nature; from enlightenment to sincerity is called teaching." Cultivating the Dao with a childlike body is "from sincerity to enlightenment"—*enlightenment* is seeing one’s nature. "From enlightenment to sincerity is called teaching": one must first investigate things to extend knowledge, exhaust principle and fulfill nature, first eliminating the acquired spirit and returning to the primal spirit—hence it is called "teaching." The childlike body’s heart is sincere; as long as one gathers and restrains the sincere heart, not allowing it to drift outward, one becomes enlightened. Enlightenment is attaining wisdom and the six penetrations. Those who have broken their bodies must first exhaust principle to attain sincerity and enlightenment—hence it is called "from enlightenment to sincerity."

Moreover, it states: *"Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; cultivating sincerity is the Dao of humanity."* (See *The Doctrine of the Mean* in the *Book of Rites*.) The Dao of Heaven is the Dao of nature; nature and Heaven share virtue, for the nature endowed by Heaven’s mandate is preserved as the Dao—this is supreme virtue. *"Cultivating sincerity"* refers to those in the postnatal state, already burdened by material desires, who must devote effort to the work of "sincerity," which is precisely *"investigating things to extend knowledge."* Thus, it further states: *"Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully realize one’s nature."* This means that only when the great person has attained the *"childlike heart"* and generated wisdom can they fully realize and perceive their nature—nature being one’s own nature. Once one perceives their own nature, they can then perceive the nature of others, which is the penetration of past lives; further, they attain the penetration of others’ minds. *"To fully realize the nature of others is to fully realize the nature of things"*—this is the divine penetration of the *"six penetrations."* At this stage, there is nothing between Heaven and Earth that is not penetrated. The sequence proceeds from sincerity to utmost sincerity, thereby attaining the penetrations of past lives, others’ minds, and divine realms. From utmost sincerity, the six penetrations are obtained, forming the *"six-penetration immortal,"* who can then assist in Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturing. For their nature returns to emptiness, becoming one with Heaven and Earth, and thus they can aid in transformation and nurturing, *"participating in Heaven and pairing with Earth."*

*"Participating"* means three; *"participating in Heaven and pairing with Earth"* constitutes the five phases. Heaven and Earth possess the power of origination and generation; the great person, sharing the same empty and numinous essence as Heaven and Earth, also possesses the virtue of origination and generation, thereby participating in and aiding their transformative nurturing. Thus, they can unite with Heaven and Earth to form the *"three talents."* As Dong Zhongshu said, *"The Confucian is one who connects Heaven, Earth, and humanity."*

From *"sincere intention"* to *"utmost sincerity,"* cultivation is easier for the childlike body but difficult for those who have broken their bodies. Thus, another path of aspiration is opened, as *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: *"Next is to extend the partial."* Those of lesser virtue, unable to attain sincerity, must first *"extend the partial."* *"Partial"* means one-sided—focusing the mind singularly on one thing. By concentrating the mind to investigate things and extend knowledge, with wholehearted devotion, one restores sincerity. Through unwavering purity, this becomes *"self-sincerity."* The so-called *"utmost sincerity is singular and dense"*—the words *"singular and dense"* convey the meaning of *"extending the partial."* For the human heart is heavy with desires; if one does not first eliminate distracting thoughts and focus singularly, gathering its dispersion and concealing it densely, how can one attain utmost sincerity? In the *"learning of the great person,"* investigating things to their utmost naturally engenders sincerity, hence it is said *"the partial can attain sincerity."*

*"Sincerity takes form, form becomes manifest, manifest becomes luminous, luminous becomes dynamic."* *"Form"* means *"sincerity within takes form without."* At the state of primordial chaos, the primal spirit naturally reemerges, and a mass of misty primal *qi* returns to the crucible—is this not *"form becomes manifest"*? *"Form"* refers to the three marks of the Dharma-body, which serve as verification of one’s practice. *"Manifest becomes luminous"* signifies further progress beyond form and manifestation: the yin of the body is exhausted, the mind is illuminated to perceive nature, and the six penetrations are attained. Once the six penetrations are obtained, one can transform on a grand scale, and countless emanations may instantly appear—hence it is said *"luminous becomes dynamic."*

*"The Dao of utmost sincerity enables foreknowledge"*—this is the great function of immortals and Buddhas. *"Sincerity is self-sincerity,"* *"and the Dao is self-Dao"*—it does not come from without but arises solely from one’s own heart. By investigating things and exhausting desires, sincerity becomes self-sincere. The Dao is the Dao of one’s own body; it is not sought externally. Rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention reside within oneself, so the Dao is within the self. As the Daoist texts say: *"The original true heart is possessed by all, complete in each,"* and as *The Heart Sutra* states: *"neither arising nor ceasing, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing."*

*"Sincerity is the beginning and end of things"*—for things obscure and prevent sincerity. When material desires are exhausted, sincerity naturally arises. Before thoughts arise, there is originally no lack of sincerity; when the mind is set down and not a single thing remains, there is also no lack of sincerity. Where was nature before parents were born? Where does nature go after death? From this, one knows the emptiness of nature. Thus, it is said: *"Sincerity is the beginning and end of things; without sincerity, there are no things."* When things are exhausted and return to emptiness, emptiness is the beginning, and sincerity is the end. Emptiness is the heart; without sincerity, there is no heart, and without heart, there are no things—neither true emptiness nor the myriad things. Now that sincerity is attained, one can not only perfect oneself but also perfect things, benefiting oneself and universally ferrying others across.

*"Perfecting oneself is benevolence; perfecting things is wisdom."* These are the three virtues inherent in nature. *"Uniting the Dao of inner and outer"*—merging inner and outer into the center—is also the inner and outer of the elixir path. To unite the great and small emptiness of inner and outer is the Dao, is sincerity. The Dao of union lies in *"timely application."* *"Timely"* refers to the *"living zi"* and *"living wu."* Confucius was called the *"sage of timely mean"*—acting appropriately in each moment, not only mastering the advance of fire and retreat of the tally but also progressing in step with the times, ultimately returning to emptiness without error of excess or deficiency. This is why he is called the *"timely sage."*

*"Timely"* also means guarding against danger and considering peril. As the Daoist texts say: *"A deviation of a hair’s breadth in fire timing fails to congeal the elixir,"* and *"The timing of the zi hour is wondrous in mind-to-mind transmission."*

The moon’s fullness depends on oral instructions.” Thus, even Confucius taught the timing of fire, hence his emphasis on “acting appropriately in each moment.” “Excess and deficiency both deviate from the Mean.” It is also said: “The noble person acts appropriately in each moment.” To achieve “utmost sincerity” is to “have no cessation”—that is, to sever the breath of mouth and nose. Only when the breath of mouth and nose is cut off can the Dao be attained. If even a trace of yin qi remains, one does not become an immortal. The Buddhists call this the “extinction of all perceptions”; extinction means the absence of breath—this is the great samādhi. The Daoists say that when the six pulses have ceased and qi returns to its root, true breath is established, equivalent to an infant in the womb. This work is undertaken during the refinement of qi into spirit. *The Orthodox Theory of Celestial Immortals* states that there must be a method of verification: placing a goose feather before the mouth and nose without it moving—only then is true breathlessness achieved. Only when breathlessness is attained is there utmost sincerity, and only then can one avoid death. Thus it is said: “Without cessation, there is duration; with duration, there is verification.” Verification means external manifestation—this is the emergence of spirit. “At first, with effort, none perceive; when effortless, all come to know.” (See *Awakening to Reality*.) In the beginning, the practice is secret, unseen by others; but when spirit emerges, all witness it. “Verification leads to boundlessness; boundlessness to vastness; vastness to brilliance.” Boundlessness is emptiness. In heaven and earth, only emptiness endures longest. The great person who unites virtue with heaven and earth shares the vastness of earth, the brilliance of heaven, and the boundlessness of emptiness—able to generate and transform the myriad things without dying, enduring for eons without end, all through “utmost sincerity.” This depends on number. By deducing from numerical principles, it can be understood. The Dao gives birth to one, one to two, two to three—these are numbers. Three, five, one—these too are numbers. By gathering the five phases into three, and the three families meeting, then returning from three to one, and one to emptiness, one attains “boundless endurance.” Number derives from “three heavens and two earths.” The great person is “earnest in benevolence, profound as an abyss, vast as heaven.” “Profound as an abyss” means depth—deeply hidden yet empty, communing with the qi of heaven and earth, supremely great and unyielding, filling heaven and earth. Without “clarity, wisdom, sagacity, and comprehension of heaven,” one cannot “illumine the bright virtue.”

The following section concerns the work of sincerity. Its practice proceeds from small to large, from subtle to manifest, from a single point to full accumulation. Initially, no one perceives it; but when the six penetrations are achieved, all see and hear, and “its brilliance becomes daily more evident.” Through daily accumulation and monthly progress, success is attained. *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: “Prolonged obscurity leads to clarity.” At first, one must obscure the discriminating mind to enter primordial chaos; over time, the original spirit emerges, and clarity dawns. Chen Nidan said: “At the beginning, one seeks obscurity but cannot attain it; later, one seeks clarity but cannot attain it.” When first practicing, the spirit must first become obscure to extinguish the discriminating mind, uniting knowledge with spirit, free from attachment, and the heart becomes still—entering a drowsy state. If one clings to appearances, sleep does not come easily, and the spirit does not easily become obscure. After prolonged obscurity, one seeks clarity, which must be pure and cool—this work is also not easily attained. To seek obscurity, one must first reach extreme emptiness and profound stillness; to seek clarity is to generate movement from extreme stillness. Without extreme stillness, movement cannot arise. One should first dwell hidden in the depths, then reveal light through the aperture. Thus it is said: “Though hidden, it shines through the aperture.” (From *The Book of Songs·Xiaoya·Zhengyue*.) First, one returns to pure Kun to become empty; then, one regains light. “I cherish the bright virtue, not with loud voice or stern countenance.” (From *The Book of Songs·Daya·Huangyi*.) “Virtue is as light as a feather” (From *The Book of Songs·Daya·Zhengmin*), “yet feathers still have form. The workings of heaven above are without sound or scent.” (From *The Book of Songs·Daya·Wenwang*.) Only then, through utmost sincerity, does one become a celestial immortal—without sound, form, scent, or taste—ascending beyond the thirty-three heavens to the realm beyond thought and non-thought, becoming a Buddha. The Daoists call this “shattering emptiness, where the eighty-four thousand pores of the body each become a world.”

At the outset of life, all are deluded by false thoughts. By returning from delusion to sincerity, one attains utmost sincerity. The Dao lies in obscuring the discriminating mind, making it muddled and chaotic. When a person sleeps, they enter chaos. As the saying goes: “Rise at sunrise, rest at sunset.” At dusk, when one retires to rest, this is when the discriminating mind rests. The spirit dwells in the eyes by day and lodges in the liver by night. The liver, associated with wood, is fond of movement, and its orifice is the eyes. When the eyes move, they generate brightness, drawing forth the seven emotions and six desires, and even at night, they can produce dreams. The original spirit differs from the discriminating mind: though it also dwells in the eyes by day, at night it lodges in the kidneys. In the body of a child, the original spirit lodges in the kidneys at night. The kidneys, associated with water, govern stillness, which is why children’s spirits are still. By returning to the state of a child, one also lodges the spirit in the kidneys at night. The kidneys connect to the ears. As practice advances, the spirit lodges in the ears at night; with further progress, it lodges in the ears day and night. Seeing form as formless, facing circumstances without attachment, being without thought in all matters, and lodging in the ears day and night—only then is the Dao attained. In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong’s golden cudgel is stored in his ear—this is the meaning: only by entering the ear is the Dao achieved.

Guanyin Bodhisattva resides in the Purple Bamboo Grove by the Southern Sea, at the Tide-Sound Cave. The tide is the kidneys; sound is the ears. The Purple Bamboo Grove is the forest of individual trees, synonymous with the "Twin Forests." Wood represents the eyes, also the mind, and belongs to *Zhen* (Thunder), for *Zhen* is thunder, and the original spirit is also thunder—mercury within fire-wood. Thus it is called "Twin Forests" and also "Thunder Sound," both containing golden mercury within.

The third of the East generates wood; the third of the East is nature, likening wood to nature. The Lord emerges from *Zhen*, and the Lord is the Great One, also human nature. The nature of human life is one’s own Lord. All Dao cultivators are governed by the Lord of Eastern Florescence; the Eastern Lord governs nature, and this is the meaning.

The third of the East is nature; the second of the South is spirit, combining to form the One Five. The first of the North is emotion; the fourth of the West is essence, combining to form the One Five. The central Five is intent, forming its own One Five. Together they make the Three Fives, which is the Dao of the Three Fives.

Returning to emptiness means returning to the void. The six lines of *Kun* hexagram are all empty; Dao cultivators should take this as their model and circulate through the six voids. "The first six: Treading frost, solid ice arrives"—Dao cultivators should begin with investigating things, as when "treading frost, solid ice" comes. Ice follows the exhaustion of yang; frost is the beginning of *Bo*. "Treading frost, solid ice" means "yin begins to congeal," so one should eliminate desires to complete the *Kun* body. Frost is autumn qi, metal qi, killing qi—all seven emotions and six desires must be slain, like "treading a tiger’s tail," yet the tiger "does not bite," seeking grace from harm.

"The six in the second place" is the second line of *Kun*, where yin grows heavier. "Upright, square, and great—without practice, nothing is unfavorable"—this refers to guarding the aperture. "Upright" is |; "square" is 口. The characters "upright" and "square" contain the meaning of "aperture." "Great" is the void, connecting to the great void outside, possessing the image of greatness—this is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. "Without practice" means knowing but not clinging, thus "nothing is unfavorable," for clinging instead brings disadvantage. "The movement of the six in the second place: upright becomes square. Without practice, nothing is unfavorable—this is the radiance of the earthly way." "Without practice" means emptying this earth, so the Dao shines. The ancient forms of "upright" and "nose" are as follows: 直, 鼻. 匕 is comparison, the two eyes compared and descending straight; 艹 is the gate of vast qi. Above is the middle field of the eyes, below is the gate of qi—this is the image of the characters "upright" and "nose."

The explanation of "Awakening to Reality" in *Awakening to Reality*: "Awakening" is our mind; in the character "real," the top is comparison, the bottom is the gate of vast qi. Comparing the eyes means withdrawing vision, and by withdrawing vision, one attains the gate of vast qi—this is the meaning of "awakening to reality." The ancient form of "square" is 口; "upright" is |. 二, 二 are the characters for "above" and "below." "Vast" contains the meaning of "heaven"; the *Book of Changes* relies on images to speak. To abandon images and speak of principle is why Song Confucians often misinterpret.

"The six in the third place"—the work should advance, thus it says, "Containing brilliance, it may be correct." "Containing" means obscurity; "containing brilliance, it may be correct" means "obscure yet daily brilliant." "Correct" means enduring. One should abide at the Gate of the Mysterious Female, nurturing with true intent, which can then activate and be cultivated to completion. If not yet complete, one must guard the aperture and know when to stop, eventually achieving success. "Royal affairs" contain the meaning of advancing yang and retreating yin. The heart is likened to the ruler; with yang within, true intent has motive, waiting for the right time to act. Using true intent in affairs can make one "radiant and great." "Without completion, there is an end" also contains the meaning of caution, introspection, and cultivation.

"The six in the fourth place" is the first line of the outer trigram. Though *Kun* is not yet pure, it gradually approaches completion, thus it says, "A sack tied shut—no blame." Like an empty sack, neither good nor bad; inside is empty, but outside is not yet empty. The sack’s mouth must be tightly closed to guard against harm, only then can there be no fault.

"The six in the fifth place"—the work of returning to emptiness is nearly complete, forming a pure *Kun* body, thus it says, "Yellow skirts—primally auspicious." "Yellow" is earth; "skirts" are lower garments. "Primal" is virtuous power, with pattern within—true intent is already within. Thus "yellow center connects to principle," "beauty is within and reaches the four limbs"—true intent is in the central palace, and the whole body is at ease.

"The top six: Dragons battle in the wild, their blood dark yellow." Extreme yin generates yang; yang is the dragon. "Battling in the wild" means at the time of pure yin, yin and yang meet but do not unite, thus there is the image of "battle." For one yin and one yang, or three yins and three yangs, yin and yang can unite; but now six yins and yang is about to arise, yang qi is very weak and cannot compare, thus it is called "battle," with the image of "wild battle." Whenever six yins or six yangs are about to generate yang or yin, yin and yang cannot be balanced, so there is the image of battle, battle with bloodshed—the image of yang unable to overcome yin. "Using the six" means using the meaning of the six lines; "favorable to perpetually correct" means it is fitting to be enduringly correct and auspicious.

To seek enduring correctness and auspiciousness, one must hold emptiness and void as the heart. If one employs the six lines of *Qian*, it implies the meaning of advancing fire and retreating talisman, which differs from this and will be discussed later.

**Lecture Nine: Returning to Emptiness, Guarding Stillness, Abiding in Nature, and Reverting Qi**
**Nine Returns, Seven Reversions—All in a Moment**

In the *Kun* hexagram, qi circulates through the six voids; "returning to emptiness" means returning to *Kun*. Those who cultivate the Dao must ultimately return to emptiness and should always take *Kun* as their model. Yet how can one achieve the pure body of *Kun*? The classic states: *"Cast the body aside and the body is cultivated; forget the form and the form endures."* This is the principle of turning inward to achieve sincerity.

"Casting the body aside" means forgetting the body, treating it as external and letting it go. The corporeal form is but a shell; Buddhists call it a "foul skin-bag," composed of the essence and qi of Heaven and Earth and the essence and blood of one’s parents. It is like a house in which the spirit temporarily resides. Without this house, the primordial spirit would have no place to attach itself. Yet the body is the body, and the spirit is the spirit—at death, the primordial spirit returns to the Great Void, while the body decays. The intermediate state (*bardo*) also treats the body as a dwelling; when the dwelling is destroyed, the intermediate state departs. If one has karmic offenses, one enters hell to receive punishment; if not, one drifts aimlessly until encountering a womb and entering it, like changing dwellings.

The primordial spirit within the body is most numinous. In the postnatal state, the *hun* soul is considered numinous, acting as the master of the self, with the body as its dwelling. Since it is like a dwelling, one should regard it as insignificant and cast it aside to cultivate the Dao of "returning to emptiness." When one achieves the pure *Kun* and the body is emptied, one has returned to emptiness.

In the Buddhist *Sutra of the Sixteen Contemplations*, there is the "Contemplation of White Bones," where one visualizes one’s own body, seeing the five viscera and six bowels, imagining it as already dead, infested with worms, foul and putrid beyond approach. Practicing this for a long time, one transforms the body into white bones and contemplates them—this is called the "Contemplation of White Bones." By maintaining this contemplation, one naturally forgets the body, and for those attached to bodily form, this method is highly beneficial.

"Turning inward to achieve sincerity" requires reverting to the Dharma-body to attain sincerity. Only by casting the body aside can one cultivate the Dharma-body. Mencius said: *"I am good at nourishing my vast and flowing qi."* (See *Mencius*, "Gongsun Chou I") The two instances of "I" are emphatic: the first "I" refers to the physical self, the false self; the second "I" refers to the Dharma-body, the true self. Cultivating the false to refine the true, one nourishes the vast and flowing qi that belongs to the self. If one does not distinguish between the physical body and the Dharma-body, the first "I" could be omitted. The ancients used words with profound meaning.

The "vast and flowing qi" arises from the primordial spirit and Dharma-body; "nourishing my vast and flowing qi" means the primordial spirit and true intention unite. *"Forget the form and the form endures"* means casting the body aside, forgetting form and relinquishing the heart—for form is the heart, and the human heart is the spirit of consciousness, which sees form and enslaves it. Only by forgetting the form can one have a heart; forgetting form is relative to forgetting the heart.

All that the heart contains has form, and what is formless is deemed nonexistent. The myriad forms seen by the eyes and heard by the ears are considered "having form," while the formless is considered "not having form." Yet who knows that all forms arise from the formless? Only by seeing as if not seeing does one accord with the Dao.

The *Sutra of Purity* states: *"Inwardly contemplate the heart, and the heart is without heart; outwardly contemplate the form, and the form is without form; distantly contemplate things, and things are without things."* Forgetting form means forgetting things; inwardly contemplating without heart and outwardly contemplating without form is the meaning of forgetting heart and forgetting form, referring to oneself.

As the saying goes: *"What has form will eventually decay; what is formless is true."* Thus, to perceive all things with equanimity, forget the heart and the heart is cultivated; forget the form and the form endures. By forgetting the body’s outer form, one can empty all things and return to emptiness.

Human life consists of three aspects: body, heart, and intention. In cultivating the Dao, one must refine these three. Forget the body as body, empty the heart of heart, and when the body is forgotten and the heart is empty, intention can become true. If one cannot empty the heart, one is attached to the appearance of heart; if one cannot forget the body, one is attached to the appearance of form—for form is one of the six dusts. When the roots and dusts interact, consciousness arises, and consciousness is the heart. If one remains within the appearance of form, one cannot advance in the Dao. To transcend the appearance of form, one must forget the body and empty the heart.

The heart is the appearance of self, the body is the appearance of person, things are the appearance of sentient beings, and the desire for longevity is the appearance of life—the *Diamond Sutra* enumerates these four. Only by emptying the four appearances can one eliminate the three poisons. Greed, anger, and delusion are the three poisons, born of the seven emotions and six desires. Fame, profit, and official rank are greed; pride and competitiveness are anger; lust and infatuation are delusion. Only by emptying the four appearances can one dissolve the three poisons. If one clings to the appearances of self and others, one cannot dissolve the three poisons.

Attachment to appearances is certainly inadmissible, yet attachment to emptiness is also forbidden in Daoist cultivation. This so-called "emptiness" is dead emptiness, not true emptiness. What, then, is the difference between true emptiness and dead emptiness? True emptiness is yang and can generate wondrous existence; dead emptiness cannot. It generates thoughts of heart, mind, and emptiness, producing the appearance of emptiness—this is dead emptiness. Vast and undifferentiated, empty yet without the appearance of emptiness, is true emptiness. To forcibly empty what is not empty, to forcibly stop thoughts when they arise—this stopping mind itself is a thought, and whether the thought stops or not, it is all dead emptiness.

True emptiness arises naturally, without knowledge or perception; in a state of indistinct obscurity, profound and unfathomable. Empty yet not empty, it contains wondrous existence; existent yet not existent, it remains true emptiness. Those who cultivate the Dao must discern this carefully.

Yet in this world, all that one encounters is the seven emotions and six desires. To return to the state of emptiness, one must attain stillness of body and purity of mind. The *Kun* hexagram comprises inner and outer trigrams, corresponding to body and mind. Only when both inner and outer are empty can one circulate through the six directions of emptiness and become true emptiness. When body and mind are both still—body encompassing qi—both achieve stillness and purity, forming this ○○ phase. Only upon attaining dual emptiness does this phase manifest. When the two merge, true intention arises.

Stillness of body and mind is the essential task of Daoist cultivation. The *Analects* states: "One who can for a single day master the self and restore the rites will have all under heaven return to benevolence." (See *Analects*, "Yan Yuan") One must begin with "mastering the self and restoring the rites" (to master is to subdue thoughts; only by mastering the self can one restore the rites, for rites and principle are one) to restore this "heavenly principle." Daoists call this the "Dao-mind," like the moon on the third day of the lunar cycle. When the Dao-mind emerges, a single yang returns, generating the principle and qi of the Great Ultimate, manifesting as the crescent moon.

(The character *ren* 仁 is composed of two *ren* 人, as is *yuan* 元, signifying the mutual completion of yin and yang. The character *tian* 天 also contains two *ren* 人, representing the undifferentiated chaos of yin and yang, which coalesces into the Great Ultimate.) "All under heaven returning to benevolence" means stillness of body and mind, hence the saying: "Look not at what is contrary to ritual; listen not to what is contrary to ritual; speak not of what is contrary to ritual; move not in ways contrary to ritual." (See *Analects*, "Yan Yuan") These four actions are governed by the principle of the Great Ultimate, thereby forming the Dharma-body.

In Daoist terms: "Contain the light of the eyes, condense the resonance of the ears, seal the breath of the tongue, and regulate the breath of the nose. In seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, do not act contrary to ritual—this is how it is achieved." Only by mastering these four practices can one attain stillness of body and mind, merging into undifferentiated chaos.

"Containing" means lowering the eyelids to seal the senses. The upper eyelid serves as the screen (whether half-lowered or fully closed is not the proper method; there is a natural degree of closure that feels effortless and comfortable. Lightly closing them, appearing shut yet not entirely so, as in sleep, is the natural way of containing the light. Each person differs in their natural endowment; it should be neither too loose nor too tight, without attachment to form, just right. The key is to avoid strain, aligning with nature as one’s innate endowment.)

The words "condense" and "resonance" carry profound meaning. That which arises from within is sound; that which enters from without is noise. The ear governs resonance; when one withdraws perception and returns to listening, external sounds vanish, and the ear naturally perceives a celestial resonance. The ancients spoke of "hearing the zither without strings"—this is that sound. To condense means to prevent external influences from entering and internal sounds from scattering, allowing the sound to coalesce within. The inner resonance arises from the even regulation of nasal breath, creating an auditory impression of resonance that is not external but originates from the breath. Ancient texts say that those deeply advanced in Daoist cultivation can hear the subtle and wondrous music of the celestial realm—this is precisely it.

"Regulating nasal breath" refers to the breath of inhalation and exhalation, which must employ the "unregulated regulation." If one deliberately regulates it, it will never be regulated. This "unregulated regulation" means that throughout the twelve hours of the day, one should subtly listen to the breath outside the nose—this is "returning to listening," whereby the ear generates resonance derived from the regulated breath. If it resembles the chirping of insects or the rumble of thunder, it is unregulated. Regulation must produce resonance, as the two are interconnected. *The Later Journey to the West* states: "The shadow of the staff above the head (the qi of the prior heavens has form, like a streak of white light), the shout enters the ear." These are the secrets of breath regulation. The shadow appears when the breath is regulated, and the shout enters the ear as the sound of inhalation and exhalation—this is the way of immortals.

The tortoise lives a thousand years, breathing through its ears, known as "tortoise breathing." There is also the saying: "The crane’s embryo and the tortoise’s breath endure a thousand years," and "The continuous awareness of the tortoise’s breath"—these are practices for those who study the Dao. By listening with the ears, one can regulate the breath.

*Zhuangzi* says: "Listening with the ears is not as good as listening with the mind; listening with the mind is not as good as listening with spirit; listening with spirit is not as good as listening with qi; listening with qi is not as good as listening with emptiness." (See *Zhuangzi*, "The Human World") "Listening with spirit" refers to awareness; "not as good as listening with qi" means qi resides in emptiness.

There is a secret to regulating breath through the ears: the "Six True Words," which are *Om, Ma, Ni, Pad, Me, Hum*. From *Om* to *Me* is inhalation; *Hum* is exhalation—these are Sanskrit sounds. From *Om* to *Me*, the breath enters and descends below the navel; *Hum* returns from below upward to the throat. It is said: "The breath should be drawn in deeply and released lightly." These six Sanskrit sounds are the natural phenomena of breathing. When the breath is regulated, one naturally attains these six sounds. If the mind is not still and sleep is elusive, recite these six words. With stillness and regulated breath, one will sleep peacefully.

The six sounds of the five notes may be recited silently without vocalization. Daoists also have seven words: *Xi, Xu, He, Xi, Xi, Chui, Hu*. From *Xi* to *He* is inhalation, while *Xi* and *Chui* are exhalation—like the six sounds above, these too are breath-regulating incantations. "Sealing the tongue" means "closing the mouth," not permanent silence but merely speaking less. In sleep or waking life, many leave their mouths agape; these must be closed. Yet forcing them shut with effort strains and clings to form, which is also unsuitable—one must close them naturally. These four—ear, eye, and mouth—are the "three treasures" of which the *Canon* speaks: "Close and seal them, do not let them flow freely. The mouth remains shut, not speaking; few words accord with the primal chaos." When this is achieved, one naturally "dwells deep as a true person, floating and abiding within the rule," and true intent emerges, allowing return to emptiness.

Initially, in returning to emptiness, there is a provisional method: "sleeping practice." The former four are "classical methods"; this is a "provisional method." Since in our bodies yin is excessive and yang scarce, sleep stills both body and mind. Over time, yang arises and yin retreats in sleep, making the mind easier to quiet—thus sleep may be used first. If one can fall asleep the moment the head touches the pillow with a pure mind, that is best. If not, one may first draw a circle ○ and gaze at it with intent yet without fixation, naturally falling into deep sleep and stilling both body and mind. Only when both are stilled does sleep accord with the method. Such tranquil sleep, however, lasts but a moment before waking; if there are matters to attend to, one may address them; if not, one may sleep again. This is the finest method for generating yang in stillness.

When spirit gathers in the eyes, gazing with intent yet without fixation forgets the body and enters emptiness. One must govern this with a formless method, exercising careful judgment at the proper time.

The *Mencius* chapter on nurturing qi is also a breath-regulating practice: "This qi is most vast and most firm; nurture it with uprightness and do not harm it." (See *Gongsun Chou I*) "Neither forget nor force" is "upright nurturing"; without it, harm arises. "That which arises from accumulating rightness" is metal qi—Daoists speak of "metal," which shares the meaning of "rightness." "Upright, square, and great. Reverence straightens the inner; rightness squares the outer." These are the words of the *Kun* hexagram. Thus qi comes from without, a teaching shared by Daoists and Confucians. Yet nurturing qi is most difficult: broadly, it is nurturing qi; narrowly, it is regulating breath—neither is easy.

The *Laozi* says, "Continuous as if existing." "Continuous" means unbroken; "existing" means generating being from non-being. Will is the commander of qi, its master. Only with will can one lead qi, and will arises from intent. The *Laozi’s Scripture of Emptiness and Non-Being* states: "That from which intent arises is called will." Thus intent commands qi, and qi flows continuously. "Continuous as if existing" means relying on breath, with will as its master. Only thus can one return to the root and restore life. "Existing" means abiding in the root. Thus the *Book of Transformation’s* "Pearls and Jade" chapter says: "Attaining the gate of vast qi, one returns to the root; knowing the vessel of original spirit, one conceals its light." This is the union of spirit and qi.

When spirit and qi unite, they restore the primordial Taiji, after which extreme stillness gives rise to movement, and extreme movement to stillness. Movement is the mechanism of stillness; stillness, the mechanism of movement—thus creation arises. The work of returning to emptiness culminates in great stillness, generating being from non-being. Heaven and humanity merge in activation, establishing the foundation of all transformations—its function lies in movement and stillness. Movement and stillness are the firing times.

When body and mind are both stilled, one embodies the pure *Kun* hexagram, empty within and without, and creation begins. In utter chaos, yin and yang unite; extreme stillness generates movement, and yang rises. Yang is the external kidney; its rising is movement and arousal. At this moment, one may employ the nine-return practice—movement is the "living midnight." Upon movement, one must awaken and advance the work; without awareness, neither nine returns nor seven reversions can begin. Since human bodies are yin-heavy, most cannot move without intent, and even when moving, may remain unaware—thus one must first return to emptiness.

Returning to emptiness seeks the extreme of stillness and its spontaneous movement, the moment when the water’s source is utterly clear. At the outset of practice, when body and mind first grow still but have not yet reached the extreme, there may be "living midnight" and "living noon," though faint and subtle. Externally present, they fail to elicit an internal response; yang may not rise, or if it does, one may not perceive it first—only the seven-reversion practice is possible, while nine returns must wait. As yang qi gradually permeates the body, at first it moves faintly, but over time, the entire body becomes supple and tingling, metal qi fills it, and yang naturally rises. Then nine returns and seven reversions proceed simultaneously, practiced together—no sequence can be distinguished.

Initially, when cultivating, body and mind may not both be stilled, so no creation occurs. Only upon achieving inner and outer emptiness, attaining the *Kun* hexagram’s firing time, do body and mind become truly still.

Hereafter, the movement begins, gradually returning and reversing. At first, it remains sluggish. With practice and familiarity, however, the moment one engages in the work, body and mind settle into stillness. In stillness, yang rises; at the first stir, spirit perceives. Nine returns and seven reversions proceed with such swiftness that no interval can be discerned.

Yet if the arriving yang qi cannot be retained within the body, it cannot accumulate to form the elixir—thus the need for "gathering and harvesting." When yang resides within, the heart becomes alert and aware; upon reaching the *living midnight*, one senses it and becomes enlivened. Why speak of *living midnight* and *living noon*? When yang qi first arrives in the body, it is the *living midnight*; when one clearly perceives its arrival, it is the *living noon*. Midnight resides in *Kan*, noon in *Li*; yet northern midnight is southern noon, and southern noon is northern midnight. Midnight and noon share the same function: when qi arrives at midnight, awareness arises at noon. Awareness of its movement is noon; the movement itself is midnight. Midnight, from *Chou* to *Si*, completes its ascent to noon—six yang hours; noon, from *Wei* to *Hai*, descends to midnight—six yin hours. In theory, yang qi travels from emptiness to the body, from midnight to noon-awareness, spanning six hours. Yet in truth, it is exceedingly swift—movement and perception occur almost simultaneously, hence "midnight and noon share the same function." As *Wuzhen Pian* states, "Seek the true seed where lightning flashes"—though likened to lightning, its speed is no exaggeration. Movement and awareness are nearly concurrent.

Stillness is the *Wuji*; from *Wuji* arises *Taiji*; *Taiji* moves and generates yang—existing in emptiness, it is called yang qi. It emerges from nothingness, truly born of non-being. Yet when one’s body attains utmost emptiness and profound stillness, becoming true emptiness and a body of pure *Kun*, pure yin, the qi generated in emptiness is pure yang. Pure yin and pure yang, being of the same kind, resonate—like a magnet attracting iron, they communicate across barriers. Thus, from non-being arises being, drawing pure yang qi into the body. The *Kun* hexagram’s words state: *"Yellow center penetrates principle"*—from external to internal; *"Beauty resides within, extending to the four limbs."* The four limbs include hands and feet; when yang qi first stirs the body, it begins at the extremities, gradually suffusing the entire body until qi is abundant, evoking the sense of *"chang"* (unobstructed flow). The character *chang* (畅) derives from *shen* (申) with an added stroke—*shen* is metal, metal is *Qian*; when metal qi fills the body, one feels unbounded ease.

Finally, when true yang qi reaches the kidneys, yang rises, and the entire body tingles with a soft numbness—not the numbness of deadened sensation, but the gentle, reviving softness of cotton. The whole body grows warm and supple, yet not lax; at this moment, the body remains as steadfast as a mountain. This is the arrival of prenatal true yang, which must be retained and gathered. Yet the truest gathering is a gathering without gathering—one must forget the body entirely. If the body is not forgotten, yang qi may escape; if forgotten, one can draw it from one yang to six yangs, accumulating it to fullness. When fullness is reached, though one may wish to forget the body, it becomes impossible—one must cease the fire, halt the practice, and either walk or attend to tasks. If one hesitates and continues, yang qi transforms into postnatal energy and dissipates. Heat leading to sweat is the sign of postnatal transformation and loss—this must not be overlooked.

*The Red Writ of the Ancient Grotto Classic* expounds the principles of returning to emptiness in movement and stillness; Lü Zu’s *Hundred-Character Stele* and other works reveal the complete work of the elixir path, which will be discussed later. Here, we interpret *The Supreme Red Writ of the Ancient Grotto Classic* as follows. This scripture comprises three chapters.

**● The Chapter of True Conduct (Part One)**
Movement in movement arises from non-movement; action in action arises from non-action. Heaven and earth found their basis in chaos; the sage establishes the ultimate through non-action. The beginning of heaven and earth is utter stillness. Through movement, the Two Modes arise; from one comes two, from two comes three, from three come the myriad things—and the myriad things manifest. The sage abides in profound stillness and non-action, the unaroused center. When stirred, all responses are timely—this is the utmost of being. Matching heaven and earth, nurturing the myriad things, the human ultimate is established. Heaven and earth’s movement arises from non-movement; the sage’s action arises from non-action.

In non-action, spirit returns; when spirit returns, the myriad things are still. In non-movement, qi dissolves; when qi dissolves, the myriad things are born. Only by guarding the center and embracing the One, preserving spirit in silence, can one hibernate and preserve the true, awaiting its arousal. Only by attaining profound tranquility and unity, gathering qi in the abyss, can one move with the seasons, flourishing and growing. Observe the progression of the four seasons: in winter, the myriad things retreat into the earth, deeply preserving their roots; when spring arrives with the scattering of ashes, yin exhausts and yang returns, and all things sprout and grow. Only by storing deeply can one flourish abundantly—such is the principle.

Spirit guards spirit; things rely on things—their root returns to the origin. Between heaven and earth, the principles of resonance are two: first, resonance between like kinds; second, completion through opposites. Water flows toward moisture, fire toward dryness; clouds follow the dragon, wind the tiger—this is the principle of resonance between like kinds. Only pure yin can receive pure yang; only utmost stillness can give rise to utmost movement—just as extreme cold must yield to extreme heat—this is the principle of completion through opposites.

Spirit returns to the quiescence of things—this is the mutual guarding of spirit, belonging to the first category. Qi dissolves and things arise—this is the mutual reliance of things, belonging to the second category. When spirit returns to great stillness, all things become quiescent; this is the principle of spirit guarding spirit, like water nourishing water. When essence and qi are inwardly gathered, all things rely on them to come into being; this is the principle of things relying on things, like stillness giving rise to movement. Yet the sage’s attainment of emptiness and preservation of quiescence, cultivation of qi and storage of spirit, aim at nothing but returning to the root and origin.

Thus, "In learning, one daily accumulates; in the Dao, one daily diminishes"—its fundamental purport is to seek the return to the root and restoration of life, achieving longevity and enduring vision; there is no other path. Contemplate and realize it, and I myself awaken to it. The "it" refers to the great Dao of returning to the root and restoring life. In its lesser aspect, it is the principle of resonance between like kinds and completion through opposites; in its greater aspect, it is the cosmogony of the universe. From one comes two, from two comes three; following this sequence, there is death and life. From five return to three, from three return to one; reversing this process in cultivation, one attains the Dao of becoming an immortal or a buddha—all must be realized and awakened to.

The "I" is the supreme self. Entering the realm of no-gap, neither dying nor living, one becomes one with heaven and earth. "No-gap" means without separation; the great transformation is inherently without division. Entering the great transformation without gap, neither dying nor living, one transforms the mortal body into the dharma-body, perfects merit and virtue, returns to truth and becomes an immortal, sharing the same substance as the great transformation—hence it is said, "one with heaven and earth."

**Entering the Sage Chapter**
Forgetting the eyes, light overflows without limit; dissolving the ears, the mind’s perception remains profoundly deep. The reason our ears and eyes cannot be keen and bright is that improper seeing and hearing are obscured by external things. As the *Daodejing* says: "The five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears." This is the principle. Now, having forgotten seeing and hearing, the obstructions to clarity and brightness are removed, enabling the return of one’s natural luminosity—hence it is said, "light overflows without limit" and "the mind’s perception remains profoundly deep." "Light overflows without limit" means seeing all without obstruction, the utmost clarity. "Deep" means profound; "the mind’s perception remains profoundly deep" means penetrating all depths, the utmost keenness.

When both faculties are utterly forgotten and severed, it is the gate of all wonders. The ears and eyes are the organs of seeing and hearing, hence called "the two faculties." Cultivating the Dao also requires transcending the consciousness of the ears and eyes, employing the primordial spirit—yet many forget but cannot sever. Only by forgetting and severing completely, without the slightest residue, can the transformation of creation arise. The word "sever" must be noted. Our original nature is inherently luminous and complete, but the six senses interact with external dust, mistaking the false for the constant and clinging to it, thus generating delusion. Now, awakening to the illusory nature of external realms, setting aside the two roots of ears and eyes, utterly forgetting and severing them, one root returns to its source, and the six senses attain liberation. Entering the stream and forgetting existence, one achieves true enlightenment, giving rise to the most wondrous transformation. For example, the six senses can function interchangeably—seeing with the ears and hearing with the eyes, this is one; perceiving without relying on the senses, this is two; attaining the six supernatural powers, such as the divine eye and divine ear, this is three. The wonders are manifold, hence called "all wonders." It is called a "gate" because only through this can one attain all wonders, like a doorway.

Pure and complete, in harmony with the great square; boundless and vast, in harmony with the measureless. This describes the sage who has attained the Dao: the great square has no corners, the measureless is absolute; pure and complete without localization, boundless and vast beyond duality. Only the sage who has attained the Dao can achieve this.

The vastness of heaven and earth is what I sustain; the multitude of the ten thousand things is what I uphold. How can there be an end to speak of its exhaustion? Assisting heaven and earth in transforming and nourishing, the cosmos is in one’s hands, the myriad transformations arise from one’s body; heaven and earth rely on this to endure, and the ten thousand things thereby flourish. It all depends on the sage to uphold them. Confucius said: "Great was Yao as a ruler! Only heaven is great, and only Yao emulated it." (*Analects*, "Tai Bo") The *Book of Changes* says: "When the sage arises, the ten thousand eyes behold." (*Qian* hexagram, "Wenyan") Lai Zhide’s commentary states: "Rising above the myriad things, all states are at peace, and all things are intimate." Heaven and earth, the ten thousand things—because of the sage, they do not come to an end. How great is such merit and virtue!

**Abiding in the World Chapter (Part Two)**
Nurture the formless, and form endures; preserve the bodiless, and the body remains whole. When wholeness and truth mutually support each other, one can endure long. The form of the formless is the true form; the body of the bodiless is the true body. Only by attaining the formless and bodiless can one’s form and body achieve longevity and enduring vision. The so-called formless and bodiless entity is the true reality of the limitless, the primordial qi of the Great One that contains truth—the root of becoming an immortal or a buddha.

Heaven attains its truth and thus endures; earth attains its truth and thus lasts; humans attain their truth and thus live long. Heaven and earth, by attaining this limitless truth and the primordial qi, can endure long; humans, by attaining this limitless truth and the primordial qi, can also achieve longevity and enduring vision. The reason people cannot endure long is that they lose the formless, scatter the bodiless, and cannot make the hundred bones and nine orifices coexist with the true body—hence they die.

People perish prematurely because they injure and lose their formless and bodiless truth. The primordial qi of the Great One, within the human body, is the original qi—also called yang qi—innate from birth. What the common folk "use daily yet remain unaware of" is precisely this original qi. Human life is dissipated by external temptations, ensnared by the seven emotions and six desires, and the true yang and original qi are squandered. Day by day, month by month, the injury accumulates until the loss is complete; the hundred bones and nine orifices become hollow vessels, and the true essence dissipates, leading to death. As the saying goes: *"With a trace of yin qi, one cannot become an immortal; with a trace of yang qi, one does not die."* When yang is extinguished, death is inevitable. The purpose of Daoist practice lies in preserving what has not yet been lost and replenishing what has. From the void, one draws the primordial qi to the body to restore what has been lost; further accumulating essence and amassing qi, one fills the true yang to ascend as an immortal. The so-called "Small Celestial Cycle" and "Great Celestial Cycle" are both methods for refining this true yang. Lü Zu’s *Hundred-Character Stele* is the most concise among alchemical classics, yet it exhaustively expounds the Dao of inner alchemy—practitioners should study it deeply. Below is its explication:

**Nurture qi, forget speech, and guard.**
Nurturing qi is one matter, yet it requires forgetting speech and forgetting guarding. "Forgetting speech" means sealing the mouth; "forgetting guarding" is the guarding of non-guarding—knowing yet not clinging. If the word "guard" is taken too literally, truly guarding the orifices or qi, it becomes incorrect, hence "forget guarding." Only when both speech and guarding are forgotten can qi be nurtured. Speech forgotten, one remains unmoved; guarding forgotten, one attains purity—this is the meaning of "neither forgetting nor forcing." Qi and spirit arise in mutual dependence, so there is no need to speak of guarding with spirit. Returning to the orifices *is* guarding; no separate guarding is necessary.

The dwelling places of spirit are three: the Celestial Valley, the Responsive Valley, and the Spirit Valley. The Celestial Valley is the Mud Pill Palace; the Responsive Valley is the Crimson Palace, which responds to stimuli—hence its name; the Spirit Valley is the Valley Passage, also known as the yin heel orifice. Returning to the Celestial Valley, one remains still and unmoving; returning to the Responsive Valley, one may extend outward; returning to the Spirit Valley, one conceals and hides. When the original spirit returns to the Celestial Valley and the consciousness spirit retreats to the Spirit Valley, they are concealed and return to nothingness. The Responsive Valley is where inner and outer correspond, uniting with qi—this is the Crimson Palace. Daoist practitioners should begin their work here.

**Subdue the heart to act without acting.**
"Subduing the heart" means taming one’s mind. Dissolving the consciousness spirit is subduing the heart. "Acting without acting" means taking non-action as action, operating in the space between intention and non-intention—acting yet not acting—to subdue the heart. For mere action is attachment to existence, and non-action is falling into emptiness. Acting without acting means the mind is undivided, no thoughts arise—this is the meaning of "continuous yet subtle," "neither forgetting nor forcing." When the heart is subdued to this point, dynamic and static practices naturally emerge.

**In movement and stillness, know the Ancestor and the Origin.**
The "Ancestor" is the primordial qi of Qian, which in humans is nature; the "Origin" is the original qi of Kun, which in humans is life. The Ancestor is the original spirit; the Origin is the original qi—two names for the same source, divided into lead and mercury, though mercury truly resides within qi. The Ancestor is the principle-qi of the primordial Great Ultimate; the Origin is the qi born from the union of parental essence and spirit. In the postnatal body, the Ancestor is the original spirit, while the Origin is the root of sentient life—also the externally derived qi. The Ancestor and Origin are distinguished in movement and stillness: in movement, one knows the Origin; in stillness, one knows the Ancestor—this is the time of the "living zi" and "living wu." When body and mind are both still, the original spirit manifests—this is nature, the Ancestor. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, yang is born from emptiness and returns to the body—this is life, the Origin. When movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns, stillness again gives rise to movement, cycling endlessly. Stillness is spirit; movement is qi. Only when spirit and qi unite can one know movement and stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, yang returns with the original qi—this is the time to advance the yang fire. When movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns, yin approaches with cooling fluid—this is the time to retreat the yin tally. Knowing movement and stillness is knowing the Origin and the Ancestor. With these two, one completes the human Dao and may progress to the immortal Dao. The path of progress lies within this "knowing," for it contains the principles of ceaselessly returning to the root and the interdependence of heart and breath.

**Why seek further when there is nothing more to do?**
These three lines alone exhaustively expound the essentials of Daoist practice. Following this method, one can transform the mundane into the sacred without seeking elsewhere. If one deems it insufficient and seeks other paths, that is "external cultivation."

Nurturing qi with the guarding of non-guarding, nurturing the heart with the action of non-action. Movement is qi; stillness is spirit. Only by nurturing qi and nurturing the heart can one know that movement and stillness have an Ancestor and an Origin. The details of fire timing and the great Dao are simple—there is nothing else to it.

**The true constant must respond to things; in responding, one must not be deluded.**
This Dao is the "true constant." By nurturing the heart and nurturing qi, one attains the true constant and preserves the original spirit and original qi. Yet one must still respond to things—remaining impartial and magnanimous, responding to things as they come, aligning with their principles—this is "responding to things without delusion."

Within the realm of phenomena lie the six roots and six dusts—internally the six roots, externally the six dusts. When root and dust meet, one must respond by entrusting things to things themselves, without being deluded by them. For instance, when encountering wealth or feminine beauty, one must handle them with the Dao, without being seduced. This is how one preserves the original spirit and original qi without loss—this is the Dao of the true constant.

When not deluded by phenomena, the nature abides of itself; when the nature abides, qi returns of itself. Not being deluded by phenomena, the nature naturally abides. When the nature abides in the Heavenly Valley, it becomes the primordial spirit of the Heavenly Valley, and one can thereby "illumine the heart and see the nature." Once the primordial spirit abides, true breathing returns of itself. The character "return" (回) consists of two mouths, signifying mouth-to-mouth and aperture-to-aperture alignment.

Nature and life are originally inseparable. If the practitioner can cultivate nature to firmness, the primordial spirit becomes its sovereign and attains natural spiritual awareness, then the work of life will naturally advance alongside the work of nature. Ordinary breathing then becomes true breathing, and the Mysterious Pass takes form. For the primordial spirit and true breathing depend upon each other—when spirit settles, qi abides, and each breath returns to the root. As *Zhuangzi* says: "The true person breathes from the heels; their breath is deep and subtle, as if present, as if absent." This describes the state when nature abides and qi returns.

When qi returns, the elixir forms of itself; within the crucible, Kan and Li unite. When nature abides and qi returns, the one spirit and one qi naturally coalesce to form the elixir. For the primordial spirit and primordial qi, the true nature and true breathing, embrace and depend upon each other. When spirit scatters outward, qi also scatters outward; when nature returns to the root, qi naturally returns to the root—hence the saying, "exhausting nature to reach life." Buddhist texts focus solely on the principles of nature without addressing life, yet when the work of nature is accomplished, the work of life follows as a natural consequence, an inevitable attainment.

The three instances of "of itself" in the preceding and current lines reveal the subtle dynamics at play—practitioners may thus discern where to apply their effort. "Within the crucible" describes the aperture resembling Penglai’s gourd, which is also the meaning of the elixir furnace. With water and fire in harmony, Kan and Li unite—this is the manifestation of elixir formation. Once nature abides and qi returns, the elixir naturally forms within the furnace.

Kan is the moon; Li is the sun. Their union forms the character for "elixir" (丹). Yin and yang undergo reversal and transformation, universally transforming in a single thunderclap. The union of Kan and Li is the process of extracting from Kan to fill Li: taking the one yang within Kan and returning it to Li to restore its pure Qian vigor; descending the one yin within Li and returning it to Kan to restore its pure Kun image—this is the reversal of yin and yang.

The practice of the Dao lies entirely in the reversal of yin and yang. From birth after the breaking of the body, yin daily waxes while yang daily wanes, and when yang is exhausted, death follows. This is the natural course—life and death unfold in sequence. The Daoist practitioner reverses this process, from returning to emptiness and laying the foundation to refining the self, progressing through the Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Orbits. The entire practice consists of gathering the true yang from the void and returning it to the body to refine and transmute the body’s turbid yin—this is what is meant by "reversing the course to cultivate immortality and Buddhahood."

Thus, the phrase "reversal of yin and yang" encompasses the entire great function of elixir formation without omission. However, to embark on this path, one must await the moment of "earth thunder’s return." The *Yijing*’s *Fu* hexagram states: "Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?" When the heart of Heaven appears and the living midnight arrives, one should gather fire to carry metal, set the River Chariot in motion, and circulate the orbit. From the Microcosmic to the Macrocosmic Orbit, the principle is the same—one must await the "return of the one yang," the arrival of the midnight hour, before commencing the work of reversal and refinement.

As Ancestor Lü said: "When earth thunder shakes the mountain’s peak, rain awaits to wash the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil." At this time, yang fire and yin tally circulate above and below, generating being from non-being, returning from being to non-being, ascending and descending, advancing and retreating, until yin is exhausted and yang is pure, transmuting into a single qi of yang. This is the moment when the yellow sprout emerges from the soil. If the practitioner obtains the method and cultivates accordingly, even a rustic fool may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood, shedding the mortal coil to become an immortal.

The *Yijing* says: "The Supreme emerges from *Zhen*." *Zhen* Wood is the ancestral nature of the eastern trigram, "prior to Heaven yet Heaven does not oppose it"—hence the phrase "universally transforming in a single thunderclap."

White clouds ascend to the crown; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru. "White clouds ascend to the crown" describes the maturation of the great medicine, the return of the one yang, as yang qi ascends along the Governor Vessel to the Qian crown. This is what the *Awakening to Reality* means by "relying on Kun’s position to generate the body, planting it in Qian’s palace of mutual resonance." "Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru" describes yang qi reaching the crown, where the one yin arrives to mate, transmuting into a cool liquid that descends from the crown like a drop of sweet dew, passing through the multi-storied tower to return to the Yellow Court. This is the process of ingesting and obtaining the elixir—the work of the Macrocosmic Orbit.

One drinks the wine of immortality—who in their carefree wandering could know? The sweet dew enters the mouth with an extraordinary fragrance; by ingesting and obtaining the elixir, one attains longevity and enduring vision—hence it is called the "wine of immortality." As the *Awakening to Reality* says: "The eldest son suddenly drinks the wine of the west," and the *Rootless Tree* says: "The wine of ghee, the nectar of returning souls, is the Medicine King that revives the dead"—this is precisely it. This is the wine of immortality brewed and drunk by oneself, not to be shared with others—"like one who drinks water, knowing its warmth or coolness for oneself."

When the sweet dew is ingested, a pervasive coolness suffuses the body, and joy fills the heart—joy beyond compare. The Confucians call this "true joy," as in Yanzi’s "unaltered" state. This joy is known only to oneself, for only one’s own inherently empty and luminous nature, one with the Great Void, can roam freely and at ease—truly beyond the reach of words to describe.

Silently listen to the stringless melody,
Stealthily penetrate the mechanism of creation.

These two lines summarize the whole. At the outset of practice, one begins by returning to emptiness, playing the holeless flute and hearing the stringless melody, so that "nature abides of itself," "qi returns of itself," and "the elixir coalesces of itself." The three "of itself"s are precisely the "stealthy penetration." In the final stage of "returning to emptiness," one’s own emptiness merges with the emptiness of heaven and earth. With prolonged practice, one naturally shatters the void. Others see only my non-action, unaware that I have already assisted in heaven and earth’s transformative nurturance—hence "stealthily penetrate the mechanism of creation."

All told, these twenty lines form the very ladder to heaven. Though this chapter comprises only twenty lines, it exhaustively describes the work of Daoist cultivation. Follow this practice, and the ladder to heaven stands ready, allowing one to ascend step by step.

After composing the *Awakening to Reality*, the Perfected Zhang Ziyang wrote the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* and transmitted it to Bai Yuchan. He knew that Bai Yuchan could not fully grasp the profound subtleties of the *Awakening to Reality*, leading to the error of "midnight wind and thunder." The *Four Hundred Words* is simpler and clearer, serving as an explication of the *Awakening*’s imagery. Countless commentaries on the *Four Hundred Words* exist, but Peng Haogu’s is the finest. Min Yide selected Peng’s commentary and added his own annotations, making it especially lucid. Since the annotations are already exceedingly clear, a careful study of their meaning will reveal what lies beyond words. Below, we present the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* by the Perfected Zhang Ziyang, with Peng’s commentary and Min’s annotations, and expound upon them:

True earth seizes true lead,
True lead restrains true mercury.
Lead and mercury return to true earth,
Body and mind still and unmoving.

*(Peng’s Commentary)*
At the beginning of human life, Heaven’s One generates Kan Water as the kidneys, and kidney water, heavy and dense, resembles lead. The kidneys generate qi, and within qi lies a single essence of True One—this is true lead. Earth’s Two generates Li Fire as the heart, and heart fire, volatile and soaring, resembles mercury. The heart generates fluid, and within fluid lies a single spark of right yang qi—this is true mercury. Within Kan resides Wu Earth, and within Li resides Ji Earth. Water is fundamentally yin, yet within yin lies true yang; fire is fundamentally yang, yet within yang lies true yin—these are true earth. Yin intermingles with yang, and yang with yin, all depending on true earth. True lead is the qi within the body, true mercury is the spirit within the heart, and true earth is the intent within the body. If one can mobilize one’s true intent to ensure mercury always welcomes lead and lead always restrains mercury, so that lead and mercury return to true earth, then spirit and qi merge, nature and emotions unite, and body and mind become still and unmoving. Though called unmoving, within this thusness there is clarity, and within this darkness there is illumination. Illusory thoughts are extinguished, yet the illuminating mind remains undimmed; the physical body seems dead, yet the Dharma-body endures—this is not a fall into inert emptiness or withered desiccation.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
By directing intent to dwell in the body and gather the mind, one achieves the clustering of the Five Phases and the harmony of the Four Images. From this, the Five Qi converge at the origin, and gradually the Three Flowers gather at the crown. How direct and unencumbered—it is simply a matter of sincerity leading the way. True earth is true intent, which is also the natural spiritual awareness; true lead is the precelestial True Yi’s qi; true mercury is the restless spirit within the heart. By using true intent to seize the precelestial True Yi’s qi, one employs precelestial qi to subdue the restless human mind. When lead and mercury both return to true earth, the Three Families meet at the Central Palace, and body and mind become still and unmoving.

From emptiness, white snow is born,
From stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.
The jade crucible’s fire glows gently,
The golden tripod emits purple radiance.

*(Peng’s Commentary)*
Emptiness and stillness are the initial efforts in gathering the medicine; white snow and the yellow sprout are the signs of the medicine’s arising within the body. Yet associating "white snow" with "emptiness" and the "yellow sprout" with "stillness" also has its distinctions. White snow arises from the void, while the yellow sprout requires the nurturing of fire, for fire can generate earth. When the time corresponds to the *Gou* hexagram, heaven conjoins with earth, and from emptiness, white snow naturally arises; when the time corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram, earth conjoins with heaven, and from stillness, the yellow sprout naturally emerges. When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises, and the yellow sprout grows from the earth. The "jade crucible" is the Yellow Court, and "fire" is spirit. Using spirit to gather qi, the fire resides within the jade crucible, and the gentle warmth is the sign of firing. The "tripod" is the Qian position, the original palace of spirit. Black transforming into red becomes purple, and fire ascending becomes radiance—radiance and fire are not two things. "The jade crucible’s fire glows gently" means the spirit of the Qian Palace illuminates within the Kun Palace. When the tripod emits purple radiance, the spirit, receiving the fire of Qian, manifests beyond the Kun Palace, revealing the image of ascent.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
The heart dwelling in the body for a long time marks the initial effect of the body being governed by the mind. White snow is the root of jade fluid, and the yellow sprout is the origin of golden fluid. One arises from nothingness into form, the other emerges from extreme stillness into movement.

"The jade crucible" and "golden tripod" are the very places where white snow and yellow sprout attain longevity. Only within the jade crucible does the natural firing process occur—its gentle warmth nurturing until purple radiance ascends into the golden tripod, where spirit guides qi to accomplish the Dao. When true intent remains undispersed, the fire naturally glows gently.

The lotus of the Flowery Pond blooms,
The spirit-water’s golden waves grow still (or: pure).
Deep in the night when the moon shines bright,
Heaven and earth become a single mirror.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
Master Ziyang’s *Preface* states: "Using lead to refine mercury is called the Flowery Pond; infusing mercury into lead is called spirit-water." From this perspective, the Flowery Pond is the stem of life, while spirit-water is the root of nature. To merge nature and life, first cast mercury into lead, then use lead to govern mercury. The true essence of the Kan Palace, bearing the upright yang qi, ascends—its appearance like the blooming of a lotus. The upright yang qi of the Li Palace, following the true essence, descends—its tranquility like the stillness of golden waves. When the hour approaches midnight, water clears and metal whitens, and nature and life, spirit and qi, merge into one. Thus it is said, "Heaven and earth become a single mirror." This is simply the union of nature with life—concentrating spirit into the qi cavern.

The ancients said, "There is no other method in elixir refinement; merely guide spirit into the Flowery Pond, and all matters are complete." This is precisely the meaning.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
When heart and body unite, purely following Heaven’s principle, the natural workings begin, and the time to commence arrives. The line "The lotus of the Flowery Pond blooms" signifies spirit entering the qi cavern; "The spirit-water’s golden waves grow still" signifies extending nature to harmonize with emotion. Buddhist scriptures take the blooming of the lotus as the manifestation of wisdom-light. Within the fire of Li resides true water—this is spirit-water, an analogy for true mercury, which is also the heart. When the heart-ground is luminous, emotional consciousness quiets, and golden waves naturally still—golden waves being a metaphor for emotional consciousness. "Deep in the night when the moon shines bright" is the radiance of nature’s light, the image of the heart-moon’s full brilliance. Midnight is the time when external realms are most serene. At this moment, all scenes are clear, a single wheel shines alone, the furnace fire turns azure, and body and mind remain unmoving. This passage describes the time when inner cultivation matures and the light of nature manifests.

Cinnabar refines yang qi,
Quicksilver cooks metal essence.
Metal essence and yang qi—
Cinnabar and quicksilver.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
Cinnabar is the upright yang qi within liquid; quicksilver is the true essence within water. To replenish the yin of the Li Palace, extract the true essence from the liquid. "Metal essence and yang qi" when refined with yang fire become like cinnabar; when nurtured with yin tally, they become like quicksilver—yet they are not two things.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
When the time to commence arrives, refine and cook intensely, yet still govern the body with the heart and nurture the heart with the body—there is no other method. Cinnabar, when refined, is yang qi; quicksilver, when cooked, is metal essence. Yang qi and metal essence reside within cinnabar and quicksilver; without fierce firing and cooking, their true nature does not emerge. This is an analogy for original spirit and the heart of Dao, which reside within the spirit of consciousness and the human heart. By eliminating the spirit of consciousness and the human heart, one can return to the original spirit and the heart of Dao, attaining true mastery. Even cinnabar and quicksilver are one thing—different names for the same essence, united to form the Dao. This speaks of preserving the original spirit, whereby the heart of Dao naturally appears. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: "It is originally a single taste of quicksilver, circulating through all the celestial stems." This is the meaning, and the analogy is most apt and fitting.

The sun’s soul is the jade hare’s marrow,
The moon’s spirit is the golden crow’s pith.
Gather them into the tripod’s interior,
And they transform into a pool of water.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
The sun’s wood-fire is the sun’s soul, which stores spirit, and within yang resides yin—yin being the moon’s spirit. The sun cannot generate its light without the moon, hence "the jade hare’s marrow," marrow deriving from essence. The moon’s metal-water is the moon’s spirit, which stores essence, and within yin resides yang—yang being the sun’s soul. The moon cannot complete its form without the sun, hence "the golden crow’s pith," pith deriving from spirit. Just as cinnabar is the essence within the sun, which, when touched by the moon’s radiance, generates true qi; quicksilver is the radiance within the moon, which, when touched by the sun’s essence, generates true lead. Great cultivators and superior adepts transform spirit into qi, and qi into essence; middling adepts retain essence to preserve qi, and qi to preserve spirit. When spirit and essence merge and harmonize within the precious tripod, sweet dew descends, forming a pool of water.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
Through mutual nurturing and fusion, body and mind begin to transform, and only then can one observe the aperture.

The true mercury and true lead are the medicinal substances used to complete the elixir. These medicinal substances contain yin and yang within each other: true lead, a yang substance, is the sun’s soul, yet it is stored within water as the central line of Kan; true mercury, a yin substance, is the moon’s spirit, yet it is stored within fire as the central line of Li. The cultivator gathers these medicinal substances into the tripod, where the four great elements steam and fuse, yang qi ascends to the summit of Kunlun, unites with true yin, transforms into liquid, and returns to the tripod—this is the returning elixir. This passage clarifies the mutual containment of yin and yang, instructing the cultivator to invert yin and yang, returning them to the tripod.

Medicinal substances arise in the mysterious aperture,
Firing processes ignite the yang furnace.
When dragon and tiger meet,
The precious tripod gathers the mysterious pearl.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
"The mysterious aperture" is the mysterious female—mysterious yang and female yin—together called the mysterious aperture.

The lower elixir field of the human body is the furnace, where the spirit resides, and fire arises from here—hence it is called the "yang furnace." Above the furnace is the tripod. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and the medicinal substances naturally emerge—this is the time for their gathering. After obtaining the medicine, if there is no firing process to refine it, the medicine will scatter again, and how could the mysterious pearl be produced? One must "turn the pivot at the crown gate and seize the pearl beneath the black dragon’s jaw." The medicine is fire, and fire is medicine; when medicine and fire unite, dragon and tiger meet, the embryo hangs in the precious tripod, and the millet-like mysterious pearl is naturally born. Yet only when the mysterious aperture produces the medicine can the yang furnace emit fire. If the moment has not arrived but one forces growth prematurely, external fire may act, but the internal tally will not respond—this will only burn one’s own body. Generally, when spirit and qi harmonize, the mysterious aperture appears of itself. Once the mysterious aperture appears, the firing process is naturally known; once the firing process is known, dragon and tiger naturally merge. When dragon and tiger merge, the mysterious pearl is naturally formed—its subtlety lies in the interplay of movement and stillness, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth.

*(Min’s Annotation)*
When body and mind are purely unified without admixture, the symbolic transformation becomes suddenly clear. Yet one must maintain single-minded focus, for vigilance in solitude is of utmost importance. The preceding five sections emphasize only the word "stillness," but here the word "reverence" is added as the guiding principle. The work of "maintaining reverence and preserving sincerity" lies precisely here!

Observe: the medicinal substances are true lead and true mercury, which are also spirit and qi. Only after filling the abdomen with metal can the mysterious pass take form; when the abdomen contains medicine, the mysterious aperture arises. The yang furnace is the Supreme Ultimate furnace; spirit and qi are both the medicinal substances and the fire. Once the mysterious pass takes form, fire naturally arises from the yang furnace; one dragon and one tiger meet in the central palace, giving birth to the mysterious pearl. The mysterious pearl is another name for the golden elixir. The dragon pertains to wood and is called wood mercury; the tiger pertains to metal and is called metal lead. The meeting of dragon and tiger is also the merging of metal and wood. When the mysterious pearl takes form, yang is born—this truly stems from the precious tripod refining dragon and tiger. This chapter speaks of the merging of metal and wood to congeal the elixir.

This aperture is no ordinary aperture,
For it is jointly formed by Qian and Kun.
Called the cavity of spirit and qi,
Within it lies the essence of Kan and Li.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
"This aperture" refers to the aforementioned mysterious aperture. As it belongs neither to being nor non-being, transcends form and location, and exists beyond body and mind, emerging in the realm of the indistinct, it is called "no ordinary aperture." In the human body, Qian is above and Kun below; Qian’s central line seeks Kun to form Kan, which occupies Kun’s position while qi resides within it. Kun’s central line seeks Qian to form Li, which lodges in Qian’s position while spirit resides within it. Spirit is the mercury within the heart; qi is the lead within the body. The heart is the chamber of spirit, and the body is the tally of qi—hence it is called "the cavity of spirit and qi." Within the body lies a point of true yang qi, which pertains to Li; within the heart lies a point of true yin essence, which pertains to Kan—hence it is said, "within it lies the essence of Kan and Li."

*(Min’s Annotation)*
When body and mind merge into oneness, and stillness reveals the aperture, one is no longer a mortal body of flesh. Thereafter, one must guard body and mind with caution, never straying nor releasing them. The essential principle lies solely in sincerity of intention and strict mastery of desires.

Observe: the mysterious pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Master Zhang’s preface to this chapter explains it thus: "To know this aperture is to know where the winter solstice occurs, where the medicinal substances reside, where the firing process takes place, where bathing occurs, where the embryo forms, and where the embryo is shed. It has no boundaries, no inside or outside—it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness." His words are truly incisive and illuminating.

This aperture is formed by the principle and qi of the Supreme Ultimate, the root of human nature and life—hence it is said to be "jointly formed by Qian and Kun." In our postnatal bodies, it is hidden and invisible; only when medicinal substances enter the body and the elixir’s origin is congealed does this aperture manifest—hence it is called "the cavity of spirit and qi, within which lies the essence of Kan and Li." The essence of Kan and Li is the medicinal substance. As the Immortal Ge’s *Xuanxuan Poem* says:
*"Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,
The center lies in emptiness, vast and boundless.
Gather dragon and tiger within the aperture,
And the pivot of creation rests in your grasp."*
This perfectly annotates these two chapters. The nature and function of the mysterious pass have been fully expounded. Yet people still seek the mysterious pass in the physical body—how foolish!

A speck of wood mercury, crimson red,
Four pounds of metal lead, pitch black.
Lead and mercury congeal cinnabar,
Glowing with the hue of purple gold.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
The point of true yin essence within the heart is called "wood mercury." Wood corresponds to the number three, containing one point of true yang qi—hence it is called "a speck." Wood generates fire, and fire is red—hence it is called "a speck of red." The point of true yang qi within the body is called "metal lead." Metal corresponds to the number four—hence it is called "four pounds." Lead is black, and metal and water share the same palace—hence it is called "four pounds of black." First, red enters black; then, black is refined into red. Red and black merge, congealing a millet-like pearl in the precious tripod, which shines with a purple glow. Red and black combine to form purple—hence it is called "the hue of purple gold." Yet lead and mercury are not fixed substances, red and black have fixed colors, and "a speck" and "four pounds" are not fixed quantities. Those who grasp the meaning will understand for themselves.

(Min’s Exegesis) This remains the work of merging body and mind, of maintaining reverence and preserving sincerity. Through true accumulation over time, when the great Dao congeals to its fullest, then—and only then—will the heart be fully satisfied, and one may employ the practice of pure spontaneity.

Note: This chapter again speaks of the intermingling of metal and wood, culminating in the formation of the Great Elixir. Mercury is fire, and "wood mercury" is the liquid of fire within wood, its color still red; east (three) and south (two) together make five. Lead is water, and "metal lead" is the metal within water, its color still black; north (one) and west (four) together make five. Through the matchmaking of the Yellow Dame of the Center, the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir is formed—hence the saying, "Lead and mercury congeal cinnabar, shining with the hue of purple gold."

Further note: Peng’s commentary records "four pounds of black metal lead," while the version cited by the lecturer reads "three pounds of black metal lead." The characters "three" and "four" do not align. Peng’s commentary retains the original text to preserve its authenticity, while the main text follows the lecturer’s version, using "three." This discrepancy is duly noted here for scholars to consider.

The homestead’s scenery is fair,
Wind and rain deepen spring’s care.
Plowing (or tilling) costs no toil,
All the earth turns to gold.

(Peng’s Commentary) "Homestead" refers to the true earth within the body; "scenery" refers to the manifestations of the medicinal substances within. When the time of the return of the first yang arrives, simply stir the wind of Xun to blow upon the earth of Kun, thereby drawing the divine water to moisten the Flowery Pond. By the time the three yangs intermingle in harmony, one must be cautious not to expend effort in gathering, but rather neither forget nor force—then the yellow sprout of the earth will naturally burst forth. It is called "gold" because it coalesces into the Golden Elixir.

(Min’s Exegesis) The qi generated by the accumulation of righteousness is vast and unyielding; it is merely nurtured directly without harm. Note: "Homestead" here is the "treasure possessed by every household" mentioned earlier. "The homestead’s scenery is fair" signifies that one’s innate medicine is already sufficient. "Wind and rain deepen spring’s care" indicates that the firing process has reached the stage of "pure azure in the crucible." At this time, one should remain at ease, neither forgetting nor forcing—hence "plowing costs no toil." Any exertion would instead harm the Elixir. When the spiritual embryo is delivered and transformed, mountains, rivers, and the great earth all become the Seven Treasures, and one’s body is enveloped in golden light—hence "all the earth turns to gold." This chapter speaks of the work of nurturing the Great Elixir. As *Awakening to Reality* states: "To know the method of refining and nurturing the Returned Elixir, / One must plant the seed in one’s own homestead. / No need for blowing or forcing, / The fruit will naturally ripen, forming the spiritual embryo." This is the explanation of the present chapter.

True lead is born in Kan,
Its function lies in Li.
From black it transforms into red,
A dense cloud of qi fills the crucible.

(Peng’s Commentary) The kidneys generate qi, and the true water of the One within qi is true lead. This true water of the One is the correct yang qi of the Li Palace. When qi and liquid merge, the true water of the One is gathered from within the qi—not the correct yang qi extracted from the liquid—so that mother and child meet and cherish each other. Then metal is concealed within water, and there is no way for it to ascend. For the spirit to guide qi is the essential oral transmission of the ages. Hence it is said, "Its function lies in Li," for its substance is in Kan while its function is in Li. Once lead emerges through fire, water transforms from black to red. The medicine is fire itself. From the path of the Three Passes, it rises to the Ninefold Heaven, surging forth, ascending lightly, gathering and steaming, condensing like mist—its qi as dense as clouds, ascending into the crucible.

(Min’s Exegesis) This continues the previous section, emphasizing that the work of merging body and mind depends entirely on the governance of the body by the mind. It is the power of stillness. Note: True lead is born in Kan, which is fundamentally water, yet this true lead is the true fire within water—hence "its function lies in Li." The true fire of the Gate of Life surges upward into the heart’s palace, where it meets the true water of the Li Palace. Initially, it is black. Black is the color of water, but through its union with fire, black transforms into red, and the crucible generates cloud-like qi. The second chapter of the original text says, "Purple mist flies above the crucible"—this is the same dense cloud-like qi. This chapter clarifies the function of true lead.

True mercury is produced in Li,
Its function, however, lies in Kan.
The maiden passes through the southern garden,
Holding a jade olive in her hand.

(Peng’s Commentary) Though mercury is produced in the Li Palace, without the correct qi of the north to subdue it, it constantly seeks to leave the body and cannot be congealed—hence "its function lies in Kan." The maiden is mercury; the southern garden is Li. When the mercury in Li encounters the lead in Kan, lead and mercury unite, abandoning the Li Palace to descend together into the Kan position—hence "passes through the southern garden." Once it passes through the southern garden, the mercury water becomes white snow. "Jade" symbolizes its white color; "olive" symbolizes its shape, neither square nor round.

(Min’s Exegesis) This again emphasizes that the work of merging body and mind depends entirely on the nurturing of the mind by the body. It is the utmost of reverence.

Now, true mercury is born within Li, and Li is fundamentally fire. Yet this true mercury is in fact the true water within fire—hence "its function lies in Kan." When true yang ascends to the Li Palace, it immediately combines with the true water within Li to form an essence, which then descends into the Kan Palace. There, true water and true fire merge—hence "its function lies in Kan." "The maiden passes through the southern garden" means she comes from Li. It speaks of true mercury traveling from southern Li to the Kan mansion, where it unites with true fire to congeal into the jade liquid returning elixir—hence "hand holding a jade olive." The returning elixir is the fruit attained by immortals; this is the jade liquid returning elixir, thus symbolized by the "jade olive." This passage clarifies the function of true mercury.

Zhen and Dui are not east and west; Kan and Li are not south and north.
The Dipper’s handle revolves through the celestial cycle—one must grasp its gathering and clustering.

(Peng’s Commentary) Zhen is east, Dui is west, Li is south, and Kan is north—these are the directional positions of the eight trigrams. The Dao of Heaven operates without ceasing, and the Dipper’s handle shifts month by month, pointing in turn to each direction. Yin and yang, cold and heat, never miss their appointed time. The human body is a microcosm of heaven and earth: from the Mysterious Valley it ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, then descends past the Double Towers to return to the Northern Sea—this is called the "celestial cycle." The mechanism of its revolution likewise depends on the Dipper’s handle. A year has twelve months, a month thirty days, totaling three hundred and sixty days. A day has one hundred ke, so a year amounts to thirty-six thousand ke. A single day’s work can seize the qi of thirty-six thousand ke. It speaks of the cultivator of the elixir, who circulates the celestial cycle’s fire times: within one day, one day replaces a year, and the twelve hours replace the twelve months. Years are gathered into days, months into hours—only by following the Dipper’s handle in its revolutions, and east, west, south, and north need not be mentioned. If the Dipper’s handle errs even slightly, the seasons will fall into disorder. Be cautious, be cautious indeed.

Now, the ingredients for congealing the elixir, from beginning to end, are two things: true mercury and true lead. True mercury is born from Li, and Li resides in the south; true lead is born from Kan, and Kan resides in the north—hence "southern Li and northern Kan." Yet true mercury is also called the wood essence within Li, and wood resides in the east, belonging to Zhen; true lead is also the metal within water, and metal resides in the west, belonging to Dui—hence "eastern Zhen and western Dui." In truth, the two substances of mercury and lead have no fixed positions in east, west, south, or north. For the cultivator who refines lead and mercury to form the elixir, everything depends on the true intention at the center, harmonizing spirit and qi, firmly grasping the pivotal mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, gathering and clustering the qi of a full year, circulating the celestial cycle, and revolving in accord with the Dipper’s handle—hence "the Dipper’s handle revolves through the celestial cycle—one must grasp its gathering and clustering."

Fire times do not rely on hours; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*.
When it is time for bathing (or "the method"), *mao* and *you* are also (or "at times") empty comparisons.

(Peng’s Commentary) Fire, as a thing, if too great becomes scorching, if too small becomes cold—its key lies in harmonious moderation, hence fire must be called "times." A day has six times, and these times are the nodal points of our body. What hour is there? When our body reaches the extreme of stillness and begins to move, in the month this is the winter solstice, in the day this is the *zi* hour. Seizing this moment and moving in unison with it, then the fire times are here. Generally, *zi* is when yang ascends, *wu* is when yang descends, *mao* is when yang ascends and yin descends, and *you* is when yin ascends and yang descends. The saying "do not divide *zi* and *wu* by the hour" does not mean one must take the winter solstice as *zi* and the summer solstice as *wu*, or the months of the hare and rooster as *mao* and *you*. For external elixirs, adding fire is *zi*, withdrawing fire is *wu*, neither increasing nor decreasing fire is bathing—it is not bound to *zi* and *wu*, nor to *mao* and *you*.

(Min’s Exegesis) These two passages together speak of the work of merging body and mind into one, relying entirely on the true intention to preside over it—this is the power of stillness, the utmost of reverence. In truth, it is the utmost of sincerity, without ceasing. The Perfected One again reveals these eighty characters not only to impart the handle of practice to the learner but also to sweep away all the eye-obscuring fixations of those who cling to texts and images.

Now, in elixir methods, *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the four cardinal points. Advancing fire, retreating tally, warming and nurturing, and bathing all occur within them. The "winter solstice" refers to the return of the first yang, corresponding to the time for advancing fire. When it reaches *mao* and *you*, this corresponds to the time for bathing. In truth, these are the methods and measures for making the elixir, all spoken of by way of analogy. The learner must not rigidly adhere to images and texts, seeking them in the divisions of the sundial. *The Mirror for Entering the Medicine* says: "Within a single day, the twelve hours—wherever intention reaches, all can serve." Each day’s twelve hours, whenever the yang arises and the tally appears, can be the time to make the elixir—it need not be confined to the winter solstice of the year or the *zi* hour of the day. One can see this from the term "living *zi* hour." If *zi* and *wu* are like this, *mao* and *you* can be understood likewise. When learners circulate the celestial cycle, they must follow the Dipper’s handle to recognize the month, never carving the boat to seek the sword, lest they fail the earnest admonitions of Patriarch Zhang.

Crow’s liver and hare’s marrow,
Seize them and bring them to one place.
Grain upon grain,
From the subtle to the manifest.

(Peng’s Commentary) Humans receive the true primordial qi of heaven and earth, weighing three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, totaling one *jin*. Eight *liang* are the essence of the sun, hence called "crow’s liver"—this is the wood essence. Eight *liang* are the essence of the moon, hence called "hare’s marrow"—this is the metal essence.

Between metal and wood lies separation; they borrow *wu* and *ji* as their matchmakers. Through the firing of the furnace, one grain is born each day, like a millet seed in size, weighing one *zhu* and eight *li*. From the subtle to the manifest, grains accumulate into *liang*; in thirty days, they weigh thirty-eight *zhu* and four *si*; in three hundred days, three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, round and one *cun* in diameter, weighing one *jin*.

(Min’s Explanation) This plainly states that one need only unite body and mind—there is no other method of practice. Simply nurture it directly without harm, from the subtle to the manifest. This is to proceed from "vigilance in solitude" to "a heart expansive and a body at ease," until one’s *qi* fills heaven and earth.

Now, crow’s liver and hare’s marrow are the medicinal substances of true mercury and true lead. These medicinal substances are all formed through the accumulation of droplets. True lead is gathered from the void; true mercury is transformed within oneself. Refined with fire to form the elixir, hence it is said, "Grain upon grain, from the subtle to the manifest." The method involves two steps: "seizing" and "uniting." "Seizing" means gathering and sealing; "uniting" means refining and congealing. One employs one’s steadfast, unshaken true intention to accomplish this. This intention is also the natural spiritual awareness. Through prolonged practice, success may be achieved. The *Huangting Neijing Waijing Jing* states: "Immortals and Daoists are not divine; they accumulate essence and amass *qi* to attain the real." This is the explanation of this passage.

Chaos envelops the void; the void encompasses the three realms. Yet when one traces its root, it is but a grain the size of a millet seed.

(Peng’s Commentary) Where there is a world, there are the Three Powers; where there are the Three Powers, there is the void; where there is the void, there is chaos. Before the existence of heaven and earth, chaos was undifferentiated. Chaos envelops the void; the void encompasses the three realms. Yet when one traces the origin of the *qi* received at the beginning of one’s life, it is but a single grain, as large as a millet seed. This is the root of human life, which those who cultivate the elixir must know. Thus it is said: "If one seeks the secret of longevity, one must search for the root of creation."

(Min’s Explanation) Chaos is the body; the void is the mind; the One is sincerity. The body envelops the mind; the mind encompasses the body. The means by which this is achieved is the true intention. True intention in heaven and earth is the pivot of creation; in the human body, it is the master of generation and transformation. Though one may follow it, one need not remain ignorant of it. When one perceives the workings of a true adept, their grandeur is as vast as this.

Now, from the inception of creation, it proceeds from Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate, to the Two Modes and Four Images, to the transformation and generation of the myriad things—this is "chaos envelops the void; the void encompasses the three realms." Yet when one returns to the origin and restores life, the Dao lies in proceeding from the myriad back to the Three, from the Three back to the One, and from the One back to the void. Thus one may say that life arises from chaos and returns to chaos. Those who cultivate the Dao follow this principle: they begin with returning to the void and accomplish it. In the end, they shatter the void, return to the Non-Ultimate, and the great work is complete. Yet from the beginning, it is truly formed through the accumulation of one mercury and one lead, droplet by droplet, no different from the arising of the tangible world from the One. Thus it is said, "Yet when one traces its root, it is but a grain the size of a millet seed."

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "The void arises within great awakening, like a bubble in water. When it expands to the Flower Treasury World, a single tip of a hair contains three thousand great thousand worlds; three thousand great thousand worlds return to the tip of a single hair." From the perspective of differentiation, three thousand great thousand worlds are vast, while the tip of a hair is minute. Yet from the perspective of interpenetration, the tip of a hair is no different from three thousand great thousand worlds. The principle is profound; it invites deep and prolonged reflection.

The true fluids of heaven and earth intermingle;
The sun and moon contain true essence.
When one grasps the foundation of *kan* and *li*,
The three realms return to one body.

(Peng’s Commentary) The fluid of the heart descends; the *qi* of the kidneys ascends. Fluid and *qi* together are called "fluid"—this is "the true fluids of heaven and earth intermingle." The *hun* is the essence of the crow; the *po* is the marrow of the hare. Together they are called "essence"—this is "the sun and moon contain true essence." *Kan* pertains to yin; within *kan* is concealed *wu*, which is yang earth—this yang is the foundation of *kan*. *Li* pertains to yang; within *li* is concealed *ji*, which is yin earth—this yin is the foundation of *li*. When one grasps that the foundation of *kan* is *wu* earth, beginning with yang, and the foundation of *li* is *ji* earth, beginning with yin, then the heaven and earth of the body, the sun and moon within the body, are all operated by true earth, and the three realms return to one body.

(Min’s Explanation) *Kan* is the body; *li* is the mind; the foundation of *kan* and *li* is intention. In the prenatal state, *kan* resides in the west as *po*; in the postnatal state, it resides in the north as *po*, having flowed into essence. Now, combining prenatal and postnatal, merging essence and *po* into one, is the body. In the prenatal state, *li* resides in the east as *hun*; in the postnatal state, it resides in the south as *hun*, having manifested as spirit. Now, combining prenatal and postnatal, merging spirit and *hun* into one, is the mind. Only earth resides at the center, uniting the Four Images, and is truly the foundation of prenatal and postnatal *kan* and *li*. That which does not change with the prenatal or postnatal is intention. Only the superior adept employs intention to dwell in the body and gather the mind, causing body, mind, and intention to merge into one, unwavering and unceasing. Nurturing them to perfection, one attains such grandeur as to generate beings—is this not the myriad things being complete within oneself, the three realms returning to one body?

This is the ultimate work of the elixir Way, the consummate achievement of the sage. ○ The following four sections reaffirm the work of congealing essence and coalescing spirit—this is not a discourse on advancing to a further stage. Take care not to suspect the establishment of another crucible and furnace, lest you be led astray by heterodox teachings.

Now, *kan* and *li* are none other than true lead and true mercury. In other words, they are true yang and true yin, yang *qi* and yin essence. The union of heaven and earth, the radiant exchange of sun and moon, are all the workings of these two substances. Thus, they enable heaven and earth to endure eternally, and the sun and moon to preserve their luminosity forever. If one can obtain the essence of *kan* and *li* and ingest it, one may attain longevity and lasting vision, holding the cosmos in one’s hands and generating the myriad transformations within the body. Hence it is said, “the three realms return to one body.”

The three realms are the realm of desire, the realm of form, and the realm of formlessness—also corresponding to heaven, earth, and humanity, as well as essence, *qi*, and spirit.

The dragon comes from the Eastern Sea,
The tiger rises from the Western Mountain.
The two beasts wage a great battle,
Transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.

*(Peng’s Annotation)* The central yang *qi* within the heart is the dragon. Wood generates fire, and *zhen* (☳) pertains to wood, hence the dragon comes from the east. The true unity of essence within the kidneys is the tiger. Metal generates water, and *dui* (☱) pertains to metal, hence the tiger rises from the western mountain. If the dragon’s roar summons clouds to descend and the tiger’s howl stirs winds to ascend, the two beasts meet and clash before the Yellow Chamber. Then the dragon swallows the tiger’s marrow, the tiger devours the dragon’s essence, wind and clouds converge in celebration, merging into one to become the marrow of heaven and earth.

*(Min’s Explanation)* This retroactively describes the initial moment of practice, when body and mind first achieve coalescence—there is no actual battle. The word “battle” signifies that in returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, one must engage in a struggle between heaven and humanity. If heaven prevails over humanity, the demons of passion are extinguished; if humanity prevails over heaven, the obstructions of principle dissolve. Only then do heaven and humanity merge, and body and mind achieve complete transformation.

○ According to the original *Preface* of Master Ziyang: “The heart’s wildness is like a dragon; the body’s ferocity is like a tiger.” This section speaks of “the dragon coming from the Eastern Sea,” which is the *hun* of the heart; “the tiger rising from the Western Mountain,” which is the *po* of the body. In truth, these are the two substances mentioned in the *Preface*: “a single point of true yang *qi* in the body, a single point of true yin essence in the heart.” These are the two beasts. The *Preface* further states: “The heart pertains to *qian* (☰); the body pertains to *kun* (☷).” The phrase “wage a great battle” here corresponds to Chen Niniwan’s words: “subduing body and mind is like waging a field battle.” The phrase “transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth” corresponds to “heaven and earth, sun and moon, soft as silk.” Master Peng, forgetting the original positions of prenatal *kan* and *li*, hastily sought images in the postnatal realm, thus introducing terms like heart, kidneys, *zhen*, and *dui*, which deviate from the original intent. The annotation should be revised according to the *Preface*.

Now, the dragon is mercury, the heart, and spirit. Because the human heart is easily agitated, soaring and difficult to restrain, it is called a dragon. The tiger is lead, the body, and *qi*. Because the human body is full of desires, wild and often devouring, it is named a tiger. The east is *zhen* and pertains to wood; the west is *dui* and pertains to metal. In the elixir method, one drives the tiger to follow the dragon and rides the dragon to subdue the tiger—this is the union of dragon and tiger. As they are the eastern dragon and western tiger, this also represents the merging of metal and wood. In the central palace of *wu* and *ji*, they fiercely contend. Soon, the eastern dragon and western tiger both die and return to the fertile earth, transforming into the true fluid of heaven and earth, the true essence of the sun and moon, thereby congealing the returning elixir. This is the image of the great medicine returning to the furnace, the refinement of golden fluid and the returning elixir.

*The Wuzhen Pian* says:
“The white tiger of the western mountain rages wildly,
The azure dragon of the eastern sea is uncontrollable.
Seize the two beasts and make them fight to the death,
Transforming into a sheet of purple golden frost.”

The “marrow of heaven and earth” is precisely this “purple golden frost,” the symbolic image of the returning elixir.

Golden blossoms open mercury leaves,
Jade buds grow lead branches.
*Kan* and *li* never rest,
How long have *qian* and *kun* endured?

*(Peng’s Annotation)* The golden blossom is true lead, which borrows mercury to form the embryo; the jade bud is true mercury, which borrows lead to take shape. In the human body, mercury is spirit, and lead is essence. “Golden blossoms open mercury leaves” refers to the indistinct and subtle, where spirit is born within water. “Jade buds grow lead branches” refers to the profound and obscure, where essence is generated within fire. Those who grasp the method sit until golden blossoms appear and jade buds sprout, at which point the branches and leaves of lead and mercury flourish. This is the proper moment to gather the medicine and advance the fire, causing *kan* and *li* to traverse east and west, *qian* and *kun* to revolve above and below, moving back and forth, ascending and descending in an endless cycle without the slightest pause. Before obtaining the medicine, one must recognize the opening of mercury leaves and the growth of lead branches. After obtaining the medicine, one must also understand the subtleties of circulation and the proper timing of ascent and descent to achieve perfection from beginning to end and complete the sacred embryo. If *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li* do not circulate throughout the ten months, the crucible and medicine, once briefly obtained, will soon be lost. How can the golden blossoms avoid withering? How can the jade buds avoid wilting?

*(Min’s Explanation)* This section emphasizes that the key lies in the true intention presiding over the process, ensuring that body and mind merge ceaselessly without the slightest interruption. Only by embodying the great strength of the *qian* Dao with the heart and the great compliance of the *kun* Dao with the body can one naturally circulate without cease, ultimately restoring *kan* and *li* to *qian* and *kun*.

Nor is there need to elaborate on *zhen*, *dui*, *gen*, and *xun*, lest they obstruct the mind’s eye. The following section will expound upon the method of "filling and replenishing."

Consider how flowers, leaves, stems, and buds all arise from a single root. *"Golden blossoms bloom on mercury leaves"*—this is the interplay of one *kan* and one *li*, fire rising from water. *"Jade buds lengthen lead branches"*—this, too, is the interplay of one *kan* and one *li*, lotus planted in fire. Through long and steadfast cultivation, the adept first completes the *Small Celestial Cycle* of *Jade Fluid Returned Elixir*, forming the inner elixir; then proceeds to the *Great Celestial Cycle* of *Golden Fluid Returned Elixir*, forming the great elixir—yet all remains the operation of one *kan* and one *li*, one *qian* and one *kun*. Like flowers, leaves, stems, and buds growing from a single root, there is no second body.

Once the *Great Celestial Cycle* is completed and merit is perfected, one may attain longevity and lasting vision, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth, the radiance of sun and moon. The fruits of *kan* and *li*’s operation may thus endure forever. Where there is *qian* and *kun*, there is *kan* and *li*. Moreover, within the six directions, from primordial antiquity to the present—whether the vast foundation of the cosmos or the ephemeral morning mushroom and evening earthworm—all are molded by yin and yang, and none transcend the operation of *kan* and *li*. The enlightened golden immortal represents their most wondrous application.

Thus, while *qian* and *kun* may at times dissolve into primordial chaos, the golden immortal transcends chaos and endures eternally. The Most High has already passed through seven epochs of chaos, surviving seven kalpas unscathed. The *qian* and *kun* of today are no longer those of the past. From the perspective of change and constancy, one might say that *qian* and *kun* must undergo kalpas in but a brief span, yet the operation of *kan* and *li* in the great sage’s attainment never ceases for even a moment.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"The Way of heaven moves with vigor; the noble person strengthens the self without ceasing."* (See *Zhouyi*, *Qian* hexagram.) To cease not is to endure.

Bathing guards against peril,
Withdrawal and addition require careful vigilance.
In all thirty thousand moments,
A hair’s deviation may cause loss.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
A year has twelve months, totaling thirty-six thousand *ke*. These are gathered within a single day and the twelve months. For ten months, the fire timing is practiced: when yang arises, medicine is gathered from the *zi* palace and made to ascend in reverse—this is called "withdrawing lead"; when yin arises, fire is withdrawn at the *wu* position and made to descend in sequence—this is called "adding mercury." In the remaining two months, the third month nourishes water to stabilize metal, and the ninth month applies fire to restrain water. Only the water timing is practiced, not the fire timing—this is called "bathing." In the third month, life arises amid destruction; in the ninth month, destruction arises amid life. This guards against the peril of fire’s excessive dryness. Excluding the two months and six thousand *ke*, only ten months and thirty thousand *ke* remain, hence the saying, "In all thirty thousand moments."

Within these thirty thousand *ke* of effort, even a hair’s deviation may disrupt yin and yang. Only by guarding against peril and exercising careful vigilance, focusing the mind and intent, can one appear with movement and vanish with stillness in every cycle. After a full year, the infant may be nurtured, becoming an immortal of transcendence.

*(Min’s Explanation)*
Only through reverence and sincerity does the thing remain undivided. If one applies this method, a single month suffices—hence the saying, "In all thirty thousand moments." The fear of deviation lies solely in the need for absolute unity without interruption; within thirty thousand *ke*, there must be no pause for even a single breath. There is no other deviation to fear.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"If one does not constantly maintain virtue, disgrace may follow."* (See *Zhouyi*, *Heng* hexagram.) This is what is to be feared.

Here follows the translation:

---

Now, in the Dao of the Elixir, there are the methods of "drawing and adding at midnight and noon" and "bathing at dawn and dusk," whereby one advances the Yang fire to draw forth lead and retreats the Yin tally to add mercury—these must be undertaken with utmost care. When the time arrives at dawn and dusk, with the forces of punishment and virtue at the gate, Yin and Yang each occupying half, one must bathe to guard against danger and avoid error.

In the firing times of compounding the Elixir, there lies a most crucial secret. Whenever human emotions and perceptions take hold, and external visions appear before one, they inevitably stir emotional thoughts—either joy or fear. At the time of bathing, one should still contain one’s light and remain silent, free from emotional dust. Let the true intention at the center serve as one’s master, withdrawing the consciousness of the acquired mind to employ the primordial spirit, allowing it to follow its nature, unaware and unknowing, in accordance with the Emperor’s principle.

*The Great Learning* states: *"Only after attaining tranquility can one deliberate; only after deliberation can one achieve success—how strict this is!"* *The Mirror for Compounding the Medicine* says: *"Water fears drying, fire fears cold. The slightest deviation, and the Elixir will not form."* Throughout the thirty thousand *ke*, one must remain constantly vigilant to prevent any loss.

When husband and wife unite, the bridal chamber brings forth clouds and rain. After a year, a child is born—each one able to ride the crane.

*(Peng’s Annotation)*
Husband and wife refer to the true Yin and true Yang within the body. When true Yin and true Yang, with true Earth as their matchmaker, become husband and wife, they unite in the bridal chamber, clouds rising and rain descending. Within a year—ten months of gestation and two months of bathing—the infant’s qi is full, and the baby is born, riding the crane forth from the Mud-Pill Palace. Nine years produce nine children—hence "each one"—yet these are a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million transformations, not truly nine in number. The infant is called a *child* (孩), formed by the union of *hai* (亥) and *zi* (子)—this is the essential point for initiating the embryo’s formation.

*(Min’s Explanation)*
The husband is Qian, the wife is Kun, and the bridal chamber is the "extraordinary aperture." This elucidates the main purport of the seventh section, speaking generally of the union of body and mind through intention, their capture and control, and their blending into oneness to stand alongside Heaven and Earth—all through the single function of utmost sincerity. It may be likened to husband and wife, who, with a matchmaker to arrange their marriage, unite to bear a child. Yet this child is born from the "extraordinary aperture," and thus is no ordinary infant; it is only by reversing the flow that one becomes an immortal. This differs from the way of worldly husband and wife, who follow the natural course to produce a human being.

Let me further illustrate with an analogy: true Earth is intention, likened to the matchmaker; true lead is the body, likened to the husband; true mercury is the heart, likened to the wife. With the matchmaker uniting husband and wife to form a household, it is like employing intention to blend body and mind, thereby congealing the supreme Dao. Is this so? Or is it not?

I venture to submit this for your consideration, Master!

Now, in the worldly union of man and woman, the two and five essences conjoin, following the natural course to give birth to a human being—this is the way of the common. Yet the Dao of immortality bears a resemblance to this. One should take the radiant maiden of the Li Palace and pair her with the golden lord of the Kan Mansion, sending them into the Yellow Chamber of the central cavern, where they may grow intimate and affectionate, becoming clouds and rain. Thereby, the numinous medicine is matched, the sacred embryo congeals, and after ten months of nurturing, qi is perfected within and spirit is complete, giving birth to the sacred child and divine descendants. In days to come, they will ride cranes in carefree flight, entering earth and penetrating heaven—all the work of this sacred child and divine descendants.

The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"The golden lord is originally the son of the eastern house,
Raised in the western neighbor’s home, born of a borrowed body.
Recognize and summon him to return and be nurtured,
Pair him with the radiant maiden to forge marital bonds."*

It also says:
*"The radiant maiden wanders in all directions,
Her forward steps must be short, her backward steps long.
Returning, she enters the Yellow Woman’s abode,
Wed to the golden lord as his aged husband."*

This, too, conveys the same meaning. Patriarch Zhang used the natural course to illustrate the reverse cultivation, employed the way of humanity to clarify the Dao of immortality, making it easier for learners to comprehend—truly a case of "a Buddha’s mouth with a grandmother’s heart." Scholars should ponder deeply and reflect upon this repeatedly.

The *Four Hundred Characters* comprises twenty sections, unified throughout by the theme of "the essence of Kan and Li." This essence of Kan and Li arises within the mysterious aperture, which is none other than the medicinal substances of lead and mercury. It is born from emptiness and stillness, and only when body and mind are utterly serene and unmoving does the mysterious aperture first emerge. From beginning to end, all hinges upon these two lines—readers must not overlook them.

**Tenth Lecture: Yang Arises in Emptiness, Stillness Reaches Its Extremity and Reverses**
*Without Gathering, Yet Gathering—Knowing When to Stop Is Enough*

The liver stores the *hun*-soul, and the *hun* is the intermediate state of consciousness; it enters my central palace, the chamber of spirit, to become my master. At night, it is stored in the liver, and though the eyes are closed without leakage, the spirit still stirs—thus, what one ponders by day must manifest in dreams by night. For stillness belongs to the *hun*, while movement belongs to the spirit. The liver pertains to Wood, the generative *qi* of the East; the nature of Wood is movement, and only through movement can transformation arise. In nightly dreams, if one’s gall is timid, one dreams of encounters with peril; if Liver-Wood flames upward, one dreams of vexation and restless sleep—all caused by the disquiet of spirit and *hun*. To pacify them, nothing surpasses storing them not in the liver but in the kidneys. The kidneys pertain to Water and are Kan; within Kan originally resides the primordial spirit, and when the consciousness-spirit merges into it, dwelling in the deepest place, this is called “holding fast to the heart and filling the abyss.” Storing at night in the kidneys is equivalent to storing in the ears. The ears connect with the kidneys: the kidneys are the inner treasury of the ears, and the ears are the outer treasury of the kidneys. When Sun Wukong stores his golden-hooped staff, he transforms it into a needle and hides it in his ear—this is no different from storing it in the kidneys. If one can regulate the breath so that heart and breath interdepend, then storing the spirit in the ears means that inwardly it enters the ear, and outwardly it becomes true Earth. The ancients spoke of “listening to the stringless zither,” or “hearing the grand music of the heavens,” or “the wondrous sound of Avalokiteśvara,” or “the ocean-tide sound of Brahmā’s voice”—all are the wondrous sounds heard within the ear after harmonizing heart and breath. In beginning the work, this is most essential. Sun Wukong is the primordial spirit; the golden-hooped staff is primordial *qi*. When spirit and *qi* unite, they are stored in the ear. For the ears and eyes can be divided by movement and stillness: the eyes are movement, the ears are stillness. Physicians regard the area behind the ears as the “Gate of Destiny,” because the ears connect with the “Gate of Destiny”; the area before the eyes is the “Gate of Wind,” the gate of vast *qi*. When *qi* issues and enters through the ears, this is immortality—physiognomists have long held this view. The ear-gate is the “Gate of Wind,” and the nape of the neck is the “Mansion of Wind.” In Daoist practice, there is the matter of “wind arising behind the brain.” The “Mansion of Wind” is the treasury that assists *qi*; when the breath of exhalation and inhalation reaches this point, it is called the “Mansion of Wind.” In *Journey to the West*, Avalokiteśvara bestows upon Sun Wukong the power of “when he calls to Heaven, Heaven responds; when he calls to Earth, Earth answers,” and with three willow leaves transforms them into three “life-saving hairs,” placing them behind the traveler’s head. This “when he calls to Heaven, Heaven responds; when he calls to Earth, Earth answers” means exhaling to connect with the root of Heaven and inhaling to connect with the root of Earth. Willow is a yielding Wood, which is Xun-Wood; three is the *Qian* hexagram. The three hairs are primordial *qi*; placing them behind the head is taking from Kan to fill Li, transforming the *Li* hexagram into the *Qian* hexagram. This occurs after subduing the dragon-horse, for the dragon-horse is true breath and true intent. Only when the Tang Monk obtains the dragon-horse can he journey to the Western Heaven. “All day long, *Qian* acts with ceaseless vigilance”—this is the opening and closing of true breath. The three life-saving hairs are *Qian*, and also true breath; the dragon-horse is likewise true breath. When first undertaking the work, one should begin by directing the sound of the shout into the ear. Avalokiteśvara attained the Dao not through contemplating the mind but through contemplating sound. Not only Avalokiteśvara, but many buddhas have attained the Dao by this means. Thus Mañjuśrī said: “Were it not for Avalokiteśvara, I too would have realized it thus.” Why is Avalokiteśvara depicted in female form? The *Huangting Jing* says, “The ears are the enchanting maiden,” for the ears govern stillness. Now, *Li* is the middle daughter, and *Kan* is the middle son. The ears also pertain to *Kan*—why then are they female? It is not known that *Kan* pertains to Water and governs stillness, and stillness also has a feminine aspect; thus the ears are the delicate maiden, and Avalokiteśvara appears in female form. The *Qingjing Jing* says: “Heaven moves, Earth is still; the male moves, the female is still.” The male symbolizes Heaven, the female symbolizes Earth—both take stillness as their nature. When spirit and *hun* return to the ears, the heart naturally becomes still. There is another related matter that should be discussed: the *hun* is stored in the liver, and the liver connects with the gallbladder, which stores consciousness. Those with consciousness are bold; those without are timid. Both liver and gallbladder pertain to Wood. The *hun* is stored in the liver and meets the gallbladder’s consciousness, becoming the consciousness-spirit—liver and gallbladder are one, which is why they are called the “five viscera.” The gallbladder is both a *zang*-organ and a *fu*-organ. In the human body, the gallbladder resides in the precarious region of *Xu* and *Wei*. Lü Dongbin called it the “Xu-Wei cavity” and also said, “Advancing the fire in the work of Ox and Dipper.” This cavity is within the body below the gallbladder, and outside the body in the Yin Heel vessel. Both the Yin Heel and the gallbladder are *Xu-Wei*, and liver and gallbladder follow one another. Here, a brief diagram would clarify this. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Turning and bending to see and hear, opening and closing are all in harmony.”

Now, for those who cultivate the Dao, there is the "Union of One Society," which employs the term "uniting as one." The teachings of later heavens also hold this meaning of "uniting as one." The phrase "next, bend with subtlety" (from the *Record of Rites·Doctrine of the Mean*)—the character *qu* ("bend") here is the same *qu* as in "turning and bending to see and hear." When seeing and hearing are returned to unity, opening and closing naturally harmonize. This harmony arises from turning and bending, which is to withdraw vision and return hearing to the Gate of the Mysterious Female. To "turn" and to "bend" is to direct seeing and hearing here, governed by spirit—opening and closing occur precisely in this way.

"Separating qi to receive *ying* and *wei*" is the act of withdrawing vision. Not perceiving external things, one returns to *ying* and *wei*, and thus "the *kan* no longer employs hearing." *Qu* is the unity of the chariot; "turning and bending to see and hear" embodies the meaning of Avalokiteśvara. Only thus can one attain the true "harmony" of "opening and closing."

In the Daoist Canon, there is the *Scripture of Stabilized Contemplation of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Mystery*. "Numinous Treasure" is numinous in heaven and precious on earth. In humans, the numinous treasure is called "spirit," which is the numinous of heaven and the treasure of earth. "Stabilized contemplation" means that only through stabilization can one contemplate—this refers to contemplating the wondrous and observing the aperture.

Its opening lines state: "Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first relinquish affairs." To "relinquish affairs" means "to sever all external matters"—"external matters" being the seven emotions and six desires. As for loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, these manifest sincerity outwardly, rooted in heavenly nature, and are not external matters. "Sever all external matters, and nothing will oppose the mind. Then, sit in tranquility and inwardly observe the heart’s qi."

"Sitting in tranquility" does not mean the physical body assuming a seated posture. When the original spirit does not depart from the aperture, this is "sitting." To gather and settle vexations is "sitting in tranquility"—this is when the original heart does not stir. The original heart is the heavenly heart, the Dao-heart. When the original spirit and original heart remain unmoved, this is "sitting in tranquility." The character *zuo* ("to sit") is composed of "person" beside "earth"; in the ancient form, two mouths flank the earth—both signify one yin and one yang. Yin and yang arise within true earth, and harmonizing yin and yang with true earth is "sitting." Only when the original heart does not stir and vexations are dispelled can one engage in tranquil contemplation, striving for stillness.

In contemplation, one extinguishes only the moving mind, not the illuminating mind. The moving mind is the spirit of consciousness; the illuminating mind is the light of wisdom, and the original spirit is true emptiness. When the light of wisdom shines perpetually without arising thoughts, this is wielding the sword of wisdom to slay demons—demons being deviant thoughts and deluded intentions. One should congeal the empty mind, not fixate the mind; fixating the mind is attachment to form.

The *Diamond Sutra* states: "Thus should one subdue the mind." It also says: "One should give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere." When the mind does not attach, it abides nowhere—this is the Dao-heart. The words of the *Diamond Sutra* and the *Scripture of Stabilized Contemplation* share the same meaning, which is to eliminate the "four marks." When the four marks are extinguished, there is "no abiding"; the non-abiding mind is the Dao-heart, the true intention. The subsequent passages of the *Scripture of Stabilized Contemplation* all explicate this meaning, and one may refer to them.

The heart should take non-action as its true dwelling and action as its responsive trace—thus, it is constantly still and constantly responsive. Stillness is "quiescent and unmoving"; responsiveness is "moved and thus penetrating." Only after mastering the work of quiescence can one respond.

A common Buddhist saying goes: "The eye observes the nose; the nose observes the heart. The heart meets the intention; the intention meets the heart." Observing the nose is to halt at the aperture. Furthermore, in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha told the Venerable Sundarananda: "At the tip of your nose, there is whiteness—you should observe it." "Whiteness at the tip of the nose" signifies direct acceptance; "whiteness" is the whiteness born of the empty chamber. Only at the extreme of stillness does one see the white qi at the tip of the nose. Observing this whiteness for twenty-one days, one may attain the Dao. If no whiteness appears at the tip of the nose, one should first seek it. "The eye observes the nose" embodies the meaning of "you should observe it." The *guan* in "the nose observes the heart" should be read in the departing tone—*guan* means emptiness. "Nose observes" refers to the emptiness below the nose, which is the heart of the emptiness below the nose.

"Heart meets intention" means the heart meets the true intention—the true intention is the heavenly heart. Returning to emptiness begins with lowering the eyelids, congealing the ears, sealing the tongue, and regulating the breath—this is the meaning of the *Cantong Qi*'s "managing and nourishing the *yin* and *e*". "Managing" is truly congealing spirit into a body, which, from a single point accumulated over time, expands and thus enables the congealing of spirit to form a body.

The heart is the "Spiritual Mountain" and the "Spiritual Terrace." Below the Spiritual Terrace lies the "Spiritual Pond." The Spiritual Terrace is the "Crimson Palace" and the "Responsive Valley"; the Spiritual Pond is the "Gate of Life" between the two kidneys. The "Spiritual Terrace" and "Spiritual Pond" rejoice with the people—"people" here follows the meaning of "cherishing the people" in the *Great Learning*.

This chapter of the *Book of Songs* (from the *Greater Elegantiae·Spiritual Terrace*) contains the meaning of cultivating the true. The lines "When the Dipper is aligned, build the Chu Palace" also refer to guarding the aperture—"Chu Palace" is the south, the *li* direction, which is empty within. "Measuring it by the sun, build the Chu Chamber" (from the *Odes·Yong·When the Dipper is Aligned*)—observing this character *ri* ("sun") further clarifies the meaning. The Five Classics contain many allegories of Dao cultivation, which later generations failed to recognize.

The work of returning to emptiness is the matter of managing the "Spiritual Terrace" and constructing the "Spiritual Pond"—this is drawing from *kan* to fill *li*. The former is the nine returns; the latter is the seven reversions.

Yet the nine returns during the work of returning to emptiness differ slightly from the true Great Return. The Great Return is the intercourse of Qian and Kun, while the nine returns are the union of Metal and Wood. When yang qi fills the body, water and fire naturally merge within—this is the seven reversions. Water, fire, metal, and wood all depend on Earth; thus, one must begin with Earth and first attain true intent. Earth serves as the dike for water, and fire is also restrained by Earth, which likewise acts as its dike. Without Earth, water overflows; without Earth, fire rages—only with Earth can they be harmonized, allowing water and fire to merge. Metal is born of Earth and completed by it, while Wood arises from water and grows through Earth. Metal and Wood do not naturally unite; only through Earth’s mediation can they interact. Therefore, only when the two Earths form a *gui* does water and fire merge within, and Metal and Wood unite without—nine returns within and seven reversions without. Fire is spirit, water is qi; their union is thus the intercourse of spirit and qi. Only with Earth as the dike can the inner spirit and qi be stabilized, for Earth possesses the power to restrain water and fire.

Metal and Wood arise externally: Metal is the yang qi within emptiness, born from Earth’s true emptiness, the primordial qi returned from the postnatal to the prenatal. Wood is the original spirit of one’s nature, still at its utmost and then revived. Metal and Wood are established by external Earth, while water and fire are established by internal Earth. The union of Metal and Wood without and the intercourse of water and fire within are truly the work of internal and external Earths—internal and external emptiness. Externally, one forgets the body as Kun Earth, the outer Mysterious Female; internally, one forgets the heart, allowing not a single thought to arise, as Pure Earth, the inner Mysterious Female. As the ancients said, “Where the thought moves is the Mysterious Female”—this is the inner Mysterious Female, pure and thoughtless. Its image is like emptiness ○, the inner Mysterious Pass. Externally, forgetting the body to become pure Kun, its image is also like emptiness ○, the outer Mysterious Pass. With these two Mysterious Passes established, the work of seven reversions and nine returns may be accomplished.

Scholars who cannot yet attain the state of forgetting both body and heart, of cultivating both internally and externally, may first practice becoming pure Kun externally, then progress to the stage of internal purity. The verification of external pure Kun practice is the return of yang within emptiness: initially, a faint yang arrives in the body, causing the limbs to tingle and numb, gradually spreading until the whole body tingles and yang qi is abundant, and external yang stirs. Attaining internal purity is the return of one’s original spirit—yang stirs, and one can sense, gather, seal, and refine it, following the natural fire phases without artificial effort. Pure Earth is Sha Wujing in *Journey to the West*.

First, externally, the body becomes pure Kun, obtaining one Earth as Wu Earth; later, internally, the heart becomes pure, obtaining one Earth as Ji Earth. The two Earths combine to form a *gui*, like Sha Wujing and his treasure staff. *Journey to the West* first attains Wukong, then Wuneng, and finally Wujing—this is the meaning. In the work of returning to emptiness, within the nine returns, when yang qi arrives in the body and a subtle stirring is felt, this is the mechanism. To achieve the true nine returns, one must await the true yang’s response in the body, when yang qi is abundant.

Lü Zu said: “To refine the seven-reversion elixir, one must first refine the self and await the time.” The “time” refers to the “living zi” and “living wu.” The seven-reversion elixir is the meaning of seven reversions and nine returns; refining the self is refining the self to return to emptiness. Refining the self means refining the self’s Earth to obtain prenatal Wu Earth, drawing true yang from emptiness. Yet yang transforms in an instant, so one must have a method to retain it. Having summoned yang qi through returning to emptiness, one must have a method to gather this yang. This is the primordial Great Dao, which must first enter the state of chaos before it can be attained.

The primordial is the state before heaven and earth gave birth to beings; one must return from chaos to the Supreme Ultimate. At the final stage of pulverizing emptiness to return to emptiness, one goes even beyond chaos, to the state before heaven and earth were opened. The “before the image of the Emperor” (*Laozi*) is the primordial before the primordial. The initial primordial of returning to emptiness is the return from the Two Modes to the Supreme Ultimate; the final return to emptiness, the primordial before the primordial, is the return from the Supreme Ultimate to the Non-Ultimate—this is the “primordial Great Dao.” The primordial is the One. The union of spirit and qi is also the union of yin and yang, in utter chaos. If the One divides into two, one enters the postnatal from the prenatal.

The primordial Dao lies in uniting the three into one. Initially, this is the meeting of the three families: spirit is one, qi is two, and the gate of the Mysterious Female is three. Uniting the spirit in the heart with the qi in the body at the central palace of the Mysterious Female’s gate is the meeting of the three families, merging them into one, and chaos is achieved. The primordial Dao, from beginning to end, lies in uniting the three into one, the union of spirit and qi, the intercourse of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Then transformation arises—this is when true Earth and true intent emerge, enabling the summoning of the primordial qi from without, the image of “a single stroke opening heaven.” Yet how are true intent and true Earth established? The Dao lies in not a single thought arising, not a single intent scattering—only then can true intent and true Earth be attained. This is what the *Diamond Sutra* means by “giving rise to the mind without abiding anywhere.”

Beginners may find this difficult to attain; one must first seek sincerity of intent. Even sincerity is not easily achieved, so there is the work of “proceeding from the indirect.”

To begin, focus lies in singular concentration, which naturally ensures that intent does not scatter. Yet this "intent not scattering" in the external differs from the "single thought not arising" within. Singular concentration means gazing here, listening here, regulating breath here—dwelling wholly upon one without division. Regulating breath is observing breath, embodying the meaning of *zhi* and *guan*. Within this, there is the "water clock" and "martial fire." The "water clock" refers to a count of drops, though not literally numbering the breath. It echoes the idea of "the shout entering the ear"—listening to the breath with the ear becomes the counting of drops, like the measured drip of a water clock, which must be heard with the ear. This is the method of Guanyin. Yet it merely borrows the concept, not the actual counting of breaths.

*The Wuzhen Pian* states: "The eye’s sight falls short of the ear’s; the mouth’s speech cannot match the nose’s!" Eyes, ears, mouth, and nose converge into one intent, then return to unity. "Turning and bending to see and hear"—the beginning and end are martial, the middle is civil. Initially, martial fire is employed, which means listening to the breath with the ear, implying a subtle intent. The so-called "singular concentration" and "proceeding from the indirect" are one and the same. It is not about guarding a single aperture, nor using the mouth, nor relying on the heart-mind. The spirit issues forth, and the ear listens to the breath. Naturally, heart and breath depend on each other, spirit and *qi* unite, and intent does not scatter.

As the saying goes, "Knowing without guarding is the work"—this refers to "embracing the One" rather than guarding it. "Embracing" means the two ears turning inward to hold each other. If intent is used to guard, it falls into visualization; visualization generates thoughts, and emptiness is lost. The idea of "the shout entering the ear" is most subtle—ponder it carefully.

*The Cantong Qi* says: "Turning and bending to see and hear, opening and closing all harmonize." "Harmonizing" means regulating, the meaning of one opening and one closing in even rhythm. "It is the pivot of self-cultivation." The *shu* is the door’s hinge; a cart has its linchpin, within which lies a pin, allowing it to turn without falling from the pivot—this is the meaning of not scattering. Only by listening to the breath with the ear can opening and closing harmonize, rhythm remain even, and scattering be prevented, like a well-oiled pivot. The five senses all enter the *qi*, and the discriminating spirit does not stray outward. In movement and stillness alike, this is so, and thus "exhaustion is avoided." Only then can one "leave *qi* and enter *ying* and *wei*," where *ying* and *wei* are blood and *qi*. When *qi* gathers and flows to the ear, external sounds may no longer be heard. "Closing the mouth without speech, few words follow the primordial chaos," and the spirit naturally does not scatter.

"In sleep, spirit and *qi* embrace"—in stillness, spirit and *qi* unite, with spirit governing *qi* as it moves. In movement and stillness alike, there is emptiness, returning to the primordial chaos. "Awakening to await life and death"—when the time comes, the spirit knows and awakens, recognizing the arrival of the "living midnight" yet refraining from gathering it. The "true person" within Kan "floats and drifts while guarding the center." At times rising, at times descending, at times exiting, at times entering, the original spirit moves up and down through the three valleys, with the Yellow Court’s path all being the mysterious pass. From the Gate of Mystery, to the aperture of Yin Qiao, all lie within the "center." Above and below, there are two "centers." Connecting the two centers into one embodies the meaning of "My Way is threaded by one" (*Analects*, "Li Ren"). Only with this undivided intent can a single thought not arise. If one intentionally guards the Gate of Mystery, thoughts will continue unceasingly. This cannot be achieved without the word "listen"—only by listening can a single thought not arise.

The character for "life" (*ming*) is composed of one, person, mouth, and ear. When mouth and ear unite, life is attained. Mouth and ear side by side form the image of listening to the breath with the ear. The great capital city, *dudu dayi*, is derived from the ear—Guanyin enters the Dao through the ear, which is the correct path. The importance of the ear is thus evident. The ear is Kan, the mouth is Dui. Dui is the youngest daughter, also metal. It is said, "Seek it in Dui," and "Having fallen into Kan, seek it in Kan"—both refer to seeking metal. The two trigrams Kan and Dui, with three yin and three yang lines, must transform into Qian and Kun to form the *Earth-Heaven Peace* hexagram. Taking the upper line of Dui as the middle line of Kan forms *Peace*. Peace means "the universe is settled and stable." Only by returning to emptiness in this way can one gain control.

At first, the arising yang is extremely subtle; whether one can awaken to it upon its arrival is uncertain. If one can perceive it upon arrival, that is awakening. The sixth line of Kun, "Dragons battle in the wild," marks the extreme of stillness and yin, where yin is at its peak and yang is about to arise—its mechanism is exceedingly subtle. When yang arises, it forms the *Return* hexagram, with yang in the earth, yet it cannot be gathered. Thus, the first line of Qian embodies the meaning of *Return*. Here, interpreting from the *Qian* hexagram: the first line, yang hidden below, is the time of "the hidden dragon does not act." Though yang has stirred, its mechanism is subtle, so it remains concealed and unseen—hence "does not act." The medicine is still tender. Yang returns from beneath the earth, thunder moving within the earth, at the time of the winter solstice. Thus, "the hidden dragon does not act," for yang lies below. The second line, "the dragon appears," is the *Earth-Marsh Approach* hexagram. The hidden yang *qi* emerges into the field—the field is the "cinnabar field."

Having arrived at the Gate of the Mysterious Female, one is about to feel the body. The virtue is universally bestowed—this refers to the *qi* of luminous virtue, like clouds moving and rain descending. At this point, one must summon and retain it within the body, employing the work of "fire forcing metal to move," allowing it to reach fullness. This corresponds to the third line of *Qian*. The third line states, "The noble one is ceaselessly active throughout the day"—*qianqian* is yang. "Ceaselessly active throughout the day, vigilant in the evening as if facing peril, without blame." Here, one must apply effort to gather and refine. The gathering is a gathering that does not gather, hence the meaning of "vigilant in the morning and evening." The opposite of *Qian* is *Kun*; one must circulate through the six voids, taking pure *Kun* as the body. The work lies in the two words: *stabilizing* and *forgetting*. *Stabilizing* means stabilizing in the One; *forgetting* means forgetting the self. When a speck of yang *qi* reaches the four limbs, one should stabilize in the One—this is the time of the second line, "in the field." Stabilizing at the Gate of the Mysterious Female requires a slight exertion of effort, yet one must never cling to the body. Only by stabilizing externally can one generate sufficient yang *qi*. The work of stabilizing and stillness is a constant practice for the cultivator. "Ceaselessly active throughout the day" is to magnify and expand—when yang is full, it becomes the fourth line. "Concealed in the abyss" refers to the yang of the Life Gate. The external yang joins with the yang of the Life Gate, uniting like with like to resonate. The use of the word "martial" here signifies that within the Life Gate, there originally exists primordial yang *qi*. When these unite as one, great function emerges—this is the matter of yang *qi* ascending to the cauldron and filling the *Li* palace. To fill *Li* is to obtain the *qi* of luminous virtue and gather true yang. Without stabilizing externally, the third line cannot generate yang; without forgetting the self, the fourth line cannot resonate with the yang of the Life Gate. If, while forgetting the self, even a slight thought arises—whether joy or fear—the yang *qi* generated may still dissipate. Only through complete forgetting can one reach the fifth line. Having reached the fifth line, the external yang *qi* is so abundant that it stimulates the two kidneys at the Life Gate, causing the external yang to rise. It further surges upward to the Heart Palace, bringing awareness. At this time, one gathers the medicine and returns it to the crucible; heaven and human unite in activation, hence the image of "the flying dragon in the sky." Heaven and *Qian* represent the crown—yang *qi* ascends, filling *Li* to complete *Qian*. One should still take *Kun* as the body and *Qian* as the function, gathering with an empty mind. Otherwise, upon reaching the ninth line, "the exalted dragon has regret." The yang of the fifth line is neither too old nor too tender—it should be gathered immediately. The so-called "gathering" is a gathering that does not gather, a taking that does not take. Only with an unmoving mind and the forgetting of both body and self can one achieve "beauty within and harmony throughout the four limbs." If even a single thought or intention arises, the yang *qi* will depart before arriving or transform upon arrival—transformation here means reverting to the postnatal. When yang *qi* reaches the body, it brings a gentle warmth like spring, warm yet not hot. When it transforms, it induces sweating and heat, becoming postnatal. Thus, in gathering, one fears its departure; in taking, one fears its transformation. When yang arrives, first the four limbs feel supple, numb, and soft; then the entire body becomes thoroughly supple. The initial arrival at the body is the *living zi* hour; once it arrives and the heart becomes aware, it is the *living wu* hour. *Living zi* pertains to *qi*; *living wu* pertains to spirit. The saying "when the time comes, the spirit knows" means that when *living zi* arrives, the heart-spirit becomes aware—this is already the *living wu* hour. The cultivator returns to emptiness and chaos, knowing the white yet guarding the black. Awareness of *living zi* and *living wu* is the birth of medicine and the knowing of spirit. Once the time is known, one must stabilize and forget externally, never clinging to body or mind—this is of utmost importance. Though the body feels comfortable when yang arrives, as if soft and supple, the four limbs remain upright like a mountain, steadfast and unmoving. When the body becomes thoroughly supple and numb, one wishes to forget yet cannot—directly generating function, making one unable to forget even if one wishes. At this moment, one must cease the fire. The initial period is the martial fire; upon stabilizing, there remains an intention of martial fire. When forgetting the self, it becomes the civil fire; when stopping the work, it is the cessation of fire. At this point, one round of work is complete—one may say the gathering and taking are done. One should then rise and take a walk, or softly recite poetry, or gently read a book. One must not continue the practice immediately—this is of utmost importance and must not be neglected. Ceasing the fire is sealing and securing; otherwise, the yang *qi* will become hot and dissipate. Heat and sweating indicate the medicine’s departure—this is most forbidden. If yang becomes excessive, it transforms into yin, hence "regret." Here, one may distinguish three kinds of work: the first, martial fire, is "gathering and taking"; the second, civil fire, is "warming and nourishing"; the third, cessation of fire, is "sealing and securing." These three methods have been most secret among the ancient perfected ones, never lightly discussed. I now reveal them—do not treat them lightly. Initially, one practices gathering, taking, and sealing to obtain subtle yang. Through daily accumulation and monthly refinement, the metal *qi* becomes full, true yang flourishes, and the external kidney rises. Then one should gather fire to carry metal, driving the river chariot, passing through the barriers to ascend Kunlun, and "benefiting from meeting the great person." This is the Small Celestial Cycle, differing in function from the Great Celestial Cycle, which shall be detailed later. In practicing the nine-return work, the water source must be utterly pure. Some attempt to practice the nine-return work upon waking from a dream in which yang has risen—this is truly inadvisable.

Why is this so? For between the moment of dreaming and waking, it cannot be known whether stray thoughts arise. Thus, there must be a method to ensure that both body and mind remain utterly still during sleep and dreams before it can be employed. If even a single stray thought intrudes, the water source becomes impure and cannot be used. Discerning the clarity or turbidity of the water source is the most critical matter for those who cultivate the Dao.

If there is any concern that the water may be turbid, it is better to abandon it and not use it at all. The details of this shall be explained later.

The Great Dao of Primordial Heaven ultimately resides in returning to emptiness. With emptiness responding to emptiness, the work is entirely within the realm of emptiness.

The methods of elixir refinement are divided into three grades:

**Upper Grade:**
No trigrams or hexagrams, no weights or measures, no fire phases.
There is gathering, but no fixed method.

**Middle Grade:**
No trigrams or hexagrams, but there are weights, measures, and fire phases.
There is gathering, but no fixed method.

**Lower Grade:**
There are trigrams and hexagrams, weights, measures, and fire phases.
There is gathering, and there are fixed methods.

In the Upper Grade, stability and forgetting constitute the entire beginning and end of the work, with no fire phases. Guarding the center and embracing the One—this is its fire phase. Returning to emptiness within emptiness, the resonance occurs naturally within and beyond the body, and the work does not fall into form or appearance.

The Middle Grade is half in form and half beyond it, already clinging to appearances compared to the Upper Grade. The Lower Grade is entirely bound to form and appearance, requiring adherence to fixed methods.

Thus, the Upper Grade may be practiced by superior cultivators, who can achieve success in a year. The Middle Grade may be practiced by average cultivators, who may succeed in three years. The Lower Grade may be practiced by inferior cultivators, but success is uncertain. Even if fortunate enough to succeed, it consumes vast time, and many spend their entire lives without achievement. This method is an "easeful practice," capable only of dispelling illness but not prolonging life.

The Middle Grade may still lead to the Dao, as its work combines pre- and post-heavenly practices, though results are not easily attained. The Lower Grade operates entirely on the post-heavenly physical body, even more limited than the Middle Grade.

Today, most discussions of elixir methods pertain to the Middle and Lower Grades, which cultivators must also understand. Yet the Great Dao of Primordial Heaven does not reside within these three grades of elixir methods, though it shares much with the Upper Grade.

Its work is exceedingly simple, attainable in a single moment. The subtlety of the fire phase lies in its ability to condense: condensing a year into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, so that a Celestial Cycle is completed in an instant. As long as one can maintain stability, forgetting, and cessation without error, success is assured.

The Middle Grade, however, is intermixed with the post-heavenly, employing intention and awareness—already clinging to form and partially bound to the body. Thus, returning to emptiness at the end is difficult, and refining the mind is arduous. Even if the work is performed flawlessly, the utmost achievement is merely an earthly immortal, for its work is largely upon the physical form.

The Lower Grade, at best, may produce a human immortal, mostly serving as a method to dispel illness and preserve the body, far removed from true immortality. Only the Upper Grade yields divine immortals.

What I now expound is the highest vehicle of Daoism, the supreme and most authentic Dao—the Great Dao of Primordial Heaven. It takes the Great Void as the crucible, the Supreme Ultimate as the furnace, purity as the foundation of the elixir, non-action as the mother of the elixir, nature and life as lead and mercury, and stability and wisdom as water and fire.

Stability is water; wisdom arises within stability, and fire emerges within wisdom. Restraining desires and curbing anger is the union of water and fire, for only through stability can wisdom arise. As the *Book of Changes* in the *Gen* hexagram states: *"The noble person curbs anger and restrains desires."*

The union of nature and emotions is the parallel of metal and wood. Washing the mind and cleansing thoughts is bathing—this is the great forgetting. Preserving sincerity and stabilizing intention is the seal. The Three Essentials—precepts, stability, and wisdom—are no different from Buddhism; the cultivator need only refine these three.

The center is the Mysterious Pass; illuminating the mind is the sign; perceiving nature is coagulation. The unity of the Three Origins—Heaven, Earth, and Human—is the sacred embryo. The fusion of nature and life is the completion of the elixir. A body beyond the body is the shedding of the embryo. Shattering the void is attainment.

This is the subtlety of the highest vehicle, which superior cultivators may practice. It is called *"simultaneous cultivation of sudden and gradual,"* *"fulfillment of merit and virtue,"* *"direct transcendence and sudden realization,"* *"perfection of form and spirit,"* and *"union with the true Dao."*

Our practice is gradual, yet what we cultivate is *"simultaneous sudden and gradual refinement,"* ultimately achieving sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration through gradual means.

The aforementioned Upper, Middle, and Lower Grades are all gradual methods—gradual methods are expedient teachings, adapted to individuals with varying transmissions. Age is a significant factor, for when one reaches sixty-four, the hexagram *qi* is exhausted. Once the hexagram *qi* is complete, no yang remains, and the highest Dao cannot be immediately practiced. One must first train in gradual methods to dispel illnesses of the physical body, prolong life, and gradually restore true yang before the highest vehicle of the Dao can be transmitted.

Among the three grades of gradual methods, only the Upper Grade can lead to the Dao. The Middle Grade dispels illness and prolongs life, while the Lower Grade merely removes illness. The Dao commonly taught today belongs to these three grades of gradual methods. Few know of the highest vehicle.

In the Upper Grade of gradual methods, Heaven and Earth serve as the crucible and furnace, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth as the Five Phases, the sun and moon as water and fire, nature and emotions as dragon and tiger, and thought as the true seed. Since thought is taken as the true seed, there is intention—this is not the supreme and wondrous Dao, which is rooted in non-action.

With intention comes the method of visualization. First, one must visualize the "Mountain Root" (according to *Xingming Guizhi*), using the refinement of thought as the firing process, the cessation of thought as the nurturing of fire, the containment of light as the sealing of the crucible, and the subjugation of inner demons as field combat. Body, mind, and intention serve as the Three Essentials—here, one grasps their essence. The Heavenly Heart is the Mysterious Pass—here, one grasps its function. When emotions return to nature, the elixir is formed; when harmonious qi steams and permeates, it is the bath. This is the Upper Grade’s Way of prolonging life. Though similar to the Middle Grade, if a superior practitioner cultivates it with unwavering consistency, they may still attain the Dao—though it is not the Way of the Golden Immortal.

The Middle Grade differs from this, becoming even more attached to form: Heaven and Earth serve as the crucible and vessel, with Qian (Heaven) as the head and Kun (Earth) as the abdomen. Kan (Water) and Li (Fire) are the water and fire—namely, the heart and kidneys. The Black Crow and Jade Hare are the medicinal substances, where the qi of the heart and kidneys interact. Essence, spirit, ethereal soul, and corporeal soul are the Five Phases; body and mind are the dragon and tiger; qi is the true seed. A year’s cycle of cold and heat serves as the firing process, and the irrigation of Dharma-water is the bath. When inner visions do not leak outward and outer phenomena do not intrude, this is the sealing of the crucible. The Great Abyss, Crimson Palace, and Essence Chamber are the Three Essentials. The Mud Pill Palace is the Mysterious Pass (the point where the great and small intersect, like the outer edge of a dot)—this is the inner void within the human body, a tangible location. When spirit and essence merge, the elixir is formed. This is the Middle Grade’s method of nourishing life, differing only slightly from the Lower Grade. When the work is complete, one may become a Human Immortal, achieving longevity and enduring vision. This type of elixir method is the most commonly taught today. Aside from heterodox schools, those who gather to transmit the Dao mostly teach this method. The teachings of Master Sun of Tieling belong to the Upper Grade, as can be seen from his writings—his method of gathering the medicine involves intentional form and appearance.

There is also the Lower Grade, which is even harder to master. Here, one’s own body and mind serve as the crucible and furnace, and essence and qi as the medicinal substances—all entirely postnatal. The heart and kidneys are water and fire; the five viscera are the Five Phases; the liver and lungs are the dragon and tiger; essence is the true seed. The firing process follows the cycles of years, months, days, and hours. Swallowing saliva serves as the bath; the mouth and nose are the Three Essentials; the space between the kidneys and the navel is the Mysterious Pass. When the Five Phases merge, the elixir is formed. This is a method of ease and comfort, somewhat similar to the three higher grades but differing in application. Its flaw lies in taking the phrase "returning essence to replenish the brain" literally and putting it into practice. Some even employ dual cultivation with husband and wife, limiting themselves to their own spouse—though this is not as harmful as those who commit transgressions. In this method, the Mysterious Pass between the kidneys and the navel is where the work begins: one uses intention to draw breath, guiding qi to the space between the navel and the kidneys, causing it to circulate and condense there. This is its principle.

The most crucial aspect of the Lower Grade’s elixir method is forgetting emotion. If one can truly forget emotion, they may still nourish life. But if they cannot, not only will they fail to nourish life—they may even hasten its end. The Middle Grade has a method for gathering the medicine, taking qi as the true seed. When qi stirs and yang arises—at the moment of arousal—one gathers it. Since the Black Crow and Jade Hare are the medicinal substances, the left hand grasps the Golden Crow while the right hand seizes the Jade Hare. Alternatively, "the left hand seizes the Green Dragon’s head, the right hand grasps the White Tiger’s tail"—this, too, is a method of nourishing life. If practiced well, one may still achieve longevity and enduring vision.

Only the Upper Grade resembles the Supreme Vehicle, allowing one to become an immortal and merge with the Dao. Using Heaven and Earth as the crucible and furnace, one still abides in emptiness. Thought is the true seed, and refining thought into intention yields the medicine. First, one employs the practice of stopping thought, and when thought is truly gone, intention becomes the true seed. Refining thought is the firing process; ceasing thought is the nurturing. This does not contradict the Supreme Vehicle’s principle of "emptying the mind." However, refining and ceasing thought are methods of visualization—all who teach visualization proceed in this manner. By fixing the mind in one place and cultivating with unwavering focus, one may become an Earth Immortal. Yet if the source of water is not pure, becoming a Golden Immortal is difficult.

Now, let us distinguish the Mysterious Pass in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Grades as follows:

**Upper Grade:** The Mysterious Pass lies above (in the void aperture of the Mud Pill Palace or the Mountain Root) and in the Heavenly Heart—when yang stirs, it is the Heavenly Heart.

**Middle Grade:** The Mysterious Pass lies in the middle, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel, between the navel and the kidneys.

**Lower Grade:** The Spiritual Pass lies above for cultivating nature, with the Mountain Root as the Spiritual Pass. The Mysterious Pass lies below for cultivating life, with the Gate of Life as the Mysterious Pass.

From the Buddhist perspective, this can lead to the fruition of Arhat, Śrāvaka, or Pratyekabuddha, for it takes thought as the true seed and has not yet extinguished all fixations. Even if one first attains Arhatship, then progresses to Bodhisattvahood, and finally to Buddhahood—or achieves "instant Buddhahood"—this is not the cultivation of the Supreme Vehicle and does not count as merit. Those who ascend through two stages to become Buddhas do so slowly because their original source has not returned to emptiness.

Today, in discussing the firing process, I have briefly explained the gradations of Daoist and Buddhist cultivation. In the future, when you encounter those who teach the Dao, listen to their words and examine their writings—you will then know to which grade and vehicle they belong, avoiding misguided paths. This will benefit those who seek to cultivate the Dao.

The Supreme Vehicle is the primordial Great Dao, the singular method shared by the Three Teachings, as the saying goes: "There is only this one vehicle; the other two are not true." All who have become sages, Buddhas, or Heavenly Immortals throughout history have entered through this path. Heaven has no second Way.

The firing process described in alchemical texts encompasses three grades. Thus, while expounding the primordial, they also cite postcelestial images, further elaborating with "image and word." On one hand, they speak of "gathering in emptiness"; on the other, they speak of "acting with purpose"—the distinction is stark, and it rests with the reader to read and apply wisely. This is why, regardless of grade, all who refine the elixir study the *Triple Concordance* and *Awakening to Reality*.

What I describe as "numbing softness" is termed "silken melting" by Patriarch Qiu. Master Shao said, "The thirty-six palaces are all spring," while Bai Ziqing said, "Bone and flesh harmonize, all unawares"—these, too, are scenes of silken melting. When returning to emptiness, the yang qi born in the void can reach one’s body, for there is a principle of resonance at work. Having attained utmost emptiness and profound stillness, one embodies the pure Kun state, so that inner and outer are both tranquil, boundlessly obscure. Not only is the body emptied, but the heart is emptied as well—not superficially, but to the utmost extreme. Yang qi enters wherever there is no emptiness; in a state of vague indistinctness, inner resonance and outer response bring it to the body—all is the function of arising from the obscure and indistinct.

The *Supreme Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Wondrous Classic* explains this in great detail, and it shall be expounded fully later.

*Straightforward Explication of the Heavenly Mechanism in One Thread, Scroll Three*

**Lecture Eleven: The *Heart Seal Wondrous Classic* as the Ancestor of Alchemical Scriptures—Unadorned with Imagery, Its Words Reveal Profound Meaning**

Among alchemical texts, the *Yin Talisman*, *Dao and Virtue*, *Supreme Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal*, *Purity*, and *Contemplation* are regarded as the most ancient, distinguished by their brevity and clarity, with scarcely any symbolic language. Later works, however, abound in layered metaphors, giving rise to symbols within symbols and analogies within analogies, leaving scholars dazzled and bewildered, with no foothold for understanding. Moreover, the immortals, sages, and worthies of each era addressed the prevailing ills of their time, and thus their teachings often lean toward partiality. Readers must possess keen discernment to recognize their schools of thought and thereby grasp their true principles. Heterodox teachings and external paths all stem from misinterpretations of alchemical classics—such is the difficulty of reading these texts.

Here, the *Supreme Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Wondrous Classic* shall be explicated in detail as follows:

**The Three Supreme Medicines: Spirit, Qi, and Essence**

Spirit is the One—one, yet spirit. Qi is the Two—two, yet transformative. Essence is the Three—spirit and qi unite to generate essence, forming the triad. Since these are called the "supreme medicines," they are not postnatal substances but undoubtedly the prenatal *yuan* spirit, *yuan* qi, and *yuan* essence.

Distinguishing them: the postnatal spirit, qi, and essence—namely, the spirit of consciousness, the spirit of thought, the qi of breath, and the essence of intercourse—differ from the prenatal triad. The *yuan* spirit is the primordial nature of Qian, its substance inherently empty. The *yuan* qi is the qi generated at the moment of parental union, when the two essences and two qi merge—this is the prenatal within the postnatal. The *yuan* essence is the primordial, most refined essence. When these three unite as one, Dao may be attained—such are the three supreme medicines.

In the postnatal realm, the *yuan* spirit generates the spirit of thought, which is a part of the spirit of consciousness. The spirit of consciousness arises from the *yuan* spirit and *yuan* essence. During the intermediate state before rebirth, in that state of undifferentiated chaos, though tainted by karmic consciousness, the *yuan* spirit remains, sufficient to restrain desire. Postnatally, it transforms into Kan and Li, where emotion supplants nature, usurping the place of the *yuan* spirit; nature sinks into emotion, merging with the realm of primordial emotion. Consciousness seizes the undifferentiated chaos of the *yuan* spirit, rendering it luminous—thus, the spirit of consciousness is the transformed body of the union of primordial emotion and *yuan* spirit. The spirit of thought is the internal movement of the spirit of consciousness, hence called "one part," yet it truly governs the postnatal human heart. Thus, in postnatal terms, it is referred to as the "spirit of thought."

The postnatal spirit of consciousness arises from the loss of the prenatal *yuan* spirit, so alchemical texts call the *yuan* spirit the mother and the spirit of consciousness (the spirit of thought) the child, establishing a mother-child relationship. Initially, humans possess only the *yuan* spirit; the spirit of consciousness comes later. It arrives bearing the roots of emotion and the stems of intellect, entering the central palace to become the master, coating and contaminating it with habitual defilements. All postnatal base qualities arise from the pull of this intellect. If the intellect remains unstained, the spirit of consciousness remains as empty as the *yuan* spirit. From this, it is evident that the spirit of consciousness is born from emptiness, taking emptiness as its substance and responding to the seven emotions and six desires to become the spirit of consciousness. Emptiness is the *yuan* spirit—hence, the *yuan* spirit is the mother, and the spirit of consciousness the child. Alchemical texts and Buddhist scriptures call it a thief, saying, "Do not mistake the thief for your child." It is named a "thief" due to its base qualities, though in truth, it is the child.

Alchemical texts refer to the *yuan* spirit and the spirit of consciousness as "the child concealed within the mother’s womb." If the spirit of consciousness returns to the *yuan* spirit, it ceases to move.

The qi of breath and the prenatal qi also share a mother-child relationship, though in reverse: the qi of breath is the mother qi, while the prenatal qi is the child qi. The prenatal qi is formless; the qi of breath is formed. Returning from form to formlessness entails extracting the prenatal, formless qi from the postnatal qi of breath. The Dao lies in the union of yin and yang, steaming and permeating the four limbs, thereby drawing forth the prenatal qi. It is like distilled water: subjected to fire and refinement, the purest vapor emerges. Thus, the qi of breath is the mother qi, and the prenatal qi the child qi. Alchemical texts say, "The mother is trapped in the child’s womb," meaning the prenatal qi resides within the womb of postnatal qi.

Only when spirit and qi share this mother-child relationship can the elixir be formed with a foundation. *Journey to the West* speaks of the "Mother-Child River," where Zhu Bajie, after drinking its water, becomes pregnant, only learning the cause from the locals. Once pregnant, no abortion is possible—except by traveling over a thousand *li* south to "Sun-Unbinding Mountain," where the "Miscarriage Spring" flows. Drinking its water cures the condition. This is the prenatal qi: mistaking the formed qi for the prenatal qi in elixir-making traps one in form, producing a phantom elixir—hence the analogy. The Mother-Child River is governed by the Women’s Country, representing the purely yin, formed qi.

While spirit and qi share a mother-child relationship, *yuan* essence and the essence of intercourse differ. Though called "essence," *yuan* essence is in truth qi—more precisely, emotion. The union of *yuan* spirit and *yuan* qi generates *yuan* essence—this is the prenatal. Postnatally, the essence of spirit and the qi of breath, stirred by emotion, transform into formed essence, the essence of intercourse—this is the postnatal.

The *shí* spirit is one, the breath of respiration two, and *yuan* essence three—combining these three to form four yields the essence of intercourse. It cannot generate or transform itself; it must arise from the union of the three. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must first transmute the essence of intercourse into *yuan* essence—this is what is called "refining essence into qi," the first step in the work. The second step is "refining qi into spirit," and the third is "refining spirit to return to emptiness."

The essence of intercourse arises from movement and possesses a distinct root of lust, serving as the gateway of ingress and egress. Without severing this root, one cannot cut off lust. The cultivator transforms the formed into the formless, the non-empty into emptiness, and emotion into nature. To sever the root of lust, one must first transmute the essence of intercourse into *yuan* essence.

The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* originates from lust: Ānanda fell into the chamber of demonic women, his root of lust unsevered, and thus failed to attain the "perfection of ending outflows." Unable to escape calamity, what leaked was merely the essence of lust, yet this essence arises from the intercourse of spirit and qi—thus, spirit and qi also leak with it. Only by attaining the "perfection of ending outflows" can one cease leakage and sever the root of lust.

Why did Avalokiteśvara attain the Dao through the ear? Because the ear and kidney both belong to *kǎn*, and when essence leaks from the kidney, it also leaks from the ear. Thus, one must regulate the breath, directing sound into the ear to conceal the spirit within it. To purify the source of water, one must first cleanse the ear, and the kidney’s water will naturally clear. The ear can hear in all eight directions, possessing one thousand two hundred merits; the eye can only see what lies ahead and not behind, possessing but eight hundred merits. The mouth and nose share the same eight hundred merits as the eye, while the mind, capable of knowing both near and far, also possesses one thousand two hundred merits, like the ear.

The Buddhist school first purifies the ear and mind, seeking the true mind to return to the ear—only then can one attain the Dao as Avalokiteśvara did. The one thousand two hundred merits can govern the eight hundred merits, and only after attaining the Dao as Avalokiteśvara can one sever the roots of lustful thoughts and desires.

The scriptures speak of three lusts in the human body: mind, body, and root. Severing only one, whether body or mind, cannot cut off lust or end outflows. Only by severing the root of lust can one achieve the "perfection of ending outflows" and witness the "concealment of the horse’s yin," the "yin retracting like a tortoise." When the minor celestial cycle is complete and the work of seven returns and nine refinements is finished, this sign appears, the "three lusts" are severed, and the body returns to the state of a virgin—only then can one advance to cultivate the "effortless Dao of supreme virtue," no different from a virgin cultivating the truth. This is the highest realm, the great Dao of non-action.

The gradual methods of the upper, middle, and lower grades differ. Even with deep cultivation, the root of lust remains difficult to sever entirely—it may merely retract and cease movement, yet it is not extinguished to restore the virgin body. In the middle and lower grades, the root of lust is even harder to sever. During cultivation, postnatal essence and qi are intermingled, allowing only the alleviation of illness and extension of life—immortality remains distant. To become an immortal, one must first sever the root of lust, as the saying goes: "There are no immortals in heaven who leak essence."

The methods of bliss often involve refining the postnatal, taking the *shí* spirit and breath as the cauldron and furnace of body and mind, and the hare and crow as medicinal substances, harvesting the essence of intercourse. Yet what use is this formed, substantial thing? It merely yields a temporary glow to the body and a flush to the face. All formed, substantial things will eventually decay.

There are those who, in sexual intercourse between men and women, do not emit essence but return it—this is heterodox and heretical. Among them, those who practice dual cultivation with husband and wife do no harm to personal virtue, but to use a female cauldron is to commit sin, not to cultivate the Dao.

The three grades of supreme medicine are inherently formless and prenatal; how can the postnatal be called "supreme"? As the *Book of Changes* states: "That which is above form is called the Dao" (*Xì Cí*, Part I). "Above form" is the prenatal. The prenatal spirit, qi, and essence are the great medicines for elixir-making, and water and fire are also within them.

The *yuan* spirit governs the heart, *yuan* qi governs the body, and *yuan* essence governs the mind. When the spirit moves, qi follows, and essence moves accordingly—thus, spirit is mentioned first, followed by qi and essence.

Bái Yùchán said:
*"This spirit is not the spirit of thought,
But the primordial *yuan* spirit of chaos;
This qi is not the breath of respiration,
But the mist of pristine simplicity;
This essence is not the essence of intercourse,
But the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth."*
(Note: The original *Xīn Yì Rèn Dì Gē* by Bái Yùchán reads:
*"Its essence is not the essence of intercourse,
But the saliva in the Jade Emperor’s mouth;
Its qi is not the breath of respiration,
But the mist of pristine simplicity;
Its spirit is not the spirit of thought,
But one that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the beginningless."*)

The prenatal *yuan* spirit is the dynamic aspect of empty nature, the true emptiness that is wondrous existence. The prenatal *yuan* qi is the principle and qi within the Supreme Ultimate, the wondrous existence that is true emptiness. "These two emerge from the same source but differ in name; together they are called the mysterious, the mystery of mysteries, the gateway to all wonders" (*Laozi*). *Yuan* qi is the "mysterious," and *yuan* spirit is the "mystery of mysteries."

When spirit and qi unite to generate *yuan* essence, it is called "the essence of utmost yang." The Buddha said: "I possess a treasure, hidden within the mountain of form." The Dao says: "The single point of prenatal yang essence resides not in the heart or kidney, but in the single aperture of the *yuan* pass." The *yuan* pass is the mysterious aperture where spirit and qi unite as medicine, and from which medicine is born.

When this medicine is born, the "mountain of form" appears. When the mountain of form inverts, essence is entirely transformed into *qi*, and the passage of leakage is fully opened—this is what is meant by "overturning the flagstaff before the gate." Spirit resides in nature, *qi* resides in emotion; together they form the Five Phases of nature, emotion, spirit, *qi*, and essence. The Five converge into Three, called the "Three Grades," which are the supreme medicines for making the elixir.

The Confucians speak from the perspective of nature and emotion, thus distinguishing the "center" before arousal and "harmony" after arousal. "Attaining the center and harmony" means the Three Grades return to One. The *Book of Changes* says: "Qian and Kun are nature and emotion." It also says: "Refining essence to enter the spirit." And further: "Preserving the Great Harmony, each rectifies its nature and destiny." The principle and *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate reside in emotion, hence they are also called nature and destiny—this principle and *qi* are what Heaven bestows.

The supreme medicines are true lead and true mercury: true lead is the jade hare within the moon, true mercury is the golden crow within the sun. They are also called the White Tiger and the Green Dragon, the *qi* of the two crescents—this is spoken from the perspective of the medicines. The *yuan* spirit is fire, the *yuan* *qi* is medicine; the *yuan* spirit is the wood sap within fire, the *yuan* *qi* is the metal essence within water—this is spoken from the perspective of cultivation. These two are the true sun and moon within the human body. When sun and moon unite, they become "Change," the "elixir," and "illumination"—"the Dao is called the alternation of one yin and one yang."

The prenatal Three Grades are all without birth or extinction; Three is Two, and Two is One. Unlike the postnatal acquired spirit, the *qi* of breathing, and the essence of intercourse—roots of the human cycle of life and death that perish with the person—they are not the supreme medicines but rather harm nature and destiny.

*"Vaguely, indistinctly; dimly, obscurely—"*
These two lines describe the phenomena when the medicine is born and the work of initial practice. *Laozi* says: "Indistinct! Vague! Within it there is an image. Vague! Indistinct! Within it there is a thing. Dim! Obscure! Within it there is an essence. Its essence is utterly real; within it there is sincerity."

The indistinct and vague mark the moment when yang arrives; the dim and obscure mark the extreme of yin—there is a distinction between them. At the outset of practice, one returns to emptiness and guards stillness; when spirit and *qi* unite, one enters the state of primordial chaos. When chaos reaches its extreme, one enters the dim and obscure. The dim and obscure are the inner and outer purity, the four great emptinesses. At this time, knowledge is entirely absent; body and mind are both forgotten. The self no longer knows itself, and form has no form—like the profound and unfathomable, the distant and unattainable. Thus it is symbolized by the words "dim and obscure." When intensified, it becomes even more so—this is stillness taken to its utmost, what the elixir texts call "the meeting of *hai* and *zi*."

At this moment, Heaven and Earth unite, sun and moon converge; all phenomena are empty, yet wondrous existence is nurtured within. The prenatal Wuji is the foundation of creation. Thus it is said, "within it there is an essence." This essence is the primordial, undifferentiated supreme essence—the true essence that generates Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things, the *yuan* essence born from the union of *yuan* spirit and *yuan* *qi*.

At the juncture of chaos, yang emerges from the center, latent within this dim and obscure state. Though formless and imageless, Heaven and humanity have already begun to stir together. When *yuan* essence is born, "within it there is sincerity"—sincerity means the movement of ebb and flow, an unchanging truth. True essence arises from the utmost emptiness, and true sincerity appears at the extreme of stillness. When sincerity arrives, true essence reaches the palace. This "sincerity" is the movement of the living *zi* hour; when sincerity arrives, one moves from the dim and obscure to the vague and indistinct.

The vague and indistinct are the sudden awakening within chaos—yet also as if unawakened—body and mind empty and settled, as if ascending clouds and mist. At this time, the three palaces are full of *qi*, the mechanism stirs, and the flute sounds; one feels only the movement, unaware of anything else. It is clear yet not clear, like deep sleep yet not sleep—thus symbolized by the words "vague and indistinct." When intensified, it becomes even more so—this is the extreme of emptiness and stillness, what the elixir texts call the living *zi* and living *wu* hours.

At this juncture, true yang has been born; wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness, nor does true emptiness obstruct wondrous existence. Thus it is said, "within it there is an image"—the image is the arising of yang. In the dim and obscure, there is utter stillness; when being arises from non-being, one feels and thus connects—this is the "vague and indistinct." Yang has returned, and the medicine has been produced; emptiness has reached its extreme, and things are about to be fulfilled. The Three Grades, formless and blended, are concealed within this vague and indistinct state—seemingly with form and image, yet body and mind remain empty and still.

True sincerity has appeared; "within it there is a thing"—the thing is the medicine, the arrival of prenatal true yang in the body. True yang is stirred and born within the dim and obscure, while true yin responds internally at the vague and indistinct moment. With the return of one yang, the Heavenly Heart is immediately revealed—this is what is meant by "when the medicine is produced, the spirit knows." When the spirit knows, it is the vague and indistinct; within the vague and indistinct, one gathers it with the gathering that is no-gathering.

When the medicine is produced, it has an image; when gathered, it becomes a thing. Thus sincerity is the living *zi* hour; the image is the living *wu* hour; the thing is when the medicine is sufficient and ready to be gathered. The Daoists compare the elixir method to the moon, calling the initial stirring of one yang the "geng direction of the moon"—like the first crescent of the new moon on the third day, the moment when the Dao Heart begins to arise, which is also the time of the vague and indistinct.

These eight characters all carry profound meaning and must not be overlooked.

**"Preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent"**—in an instant, this is accomplished.
This phrase, continuing from the preceding text, refers to the work of gathering the medicine. From the perspective of cultivation, however, its scope is vast, encompassing the entire process from beginning to end within these four characters, "preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent." Here, I explain them in detail.

*Laozi* says: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness; the myriad things arise together, and I thereby observe their return."* "Attain" means knowing without clinging; "guard" means singular and unceasing. Emptiness cannot be guarded, but stillness can. Emptiness is nonexistence; when pushed to its extreme, existence arises. Stillness is existence; when deepened, it returns to nonexistence. Only when emptiness is utmost does the image of indistinctness appear; only when stillness is deep does one enter the time of profound obscurity.

The alchemical texts say: *"The boundless void is the Mysterious Aperture—knowing without clinging is the work."* This is preserving the nonexistent. *"Close the senses, lower the lids, and silently observe"*—this is guarding the existent. *"Rest the mind in the realm of utmost goodness"*—this is preserving the nonexistent. *"Know to rest at the gate of utmost goodness"*—this is guarding the existent.

"Preserve" is "attain"; "preserve the nonexistent" is thus profound obscurity, while "guard the existent" is indistinctness. Preserving the nonexistent is observing the wondrous with desirelessness; guarding the existent is observing the aperture with desire. At the outset of practice, empty the mind, forget the form, know without clinging, calm the spirit, and regulate the breath to return to primordial chaos—this is the work of preserving the nonexistent. When body and mind are both still, entering profound obscurity, one yang returns, the earthly thunder stirs, and one shifts into the realm of indistinctness. Then, concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, fire urges metal to move, and when metal fills the moon to its fullness, the medicine becomes firm and substantial—this is the work of guarding the existent.

Gathering with the gathering that is no-gathering, taking with the taking that is no-taking; externalizing the body to refine it, forgetting the form to preserve it—this is again the work of preserving the nonexistent. Refining and tempering, gathering the medicine into the crucible; sealing and securing it, filling the abdomen with true gold to accumulate and form the elixir—this is again the work of guarding the existent. Once the returned elixir is obtained, acting without acting yet leaving nothing undone, one reaches the point where the primordial spirit transcends, and the void is pulverized—this is again the work of preserving the nonexistent.

Thus, these four characters encompass the entire process from beginning to end, and in a single moment, the elixir may be congealed. The Great Dao is simple and easy—there is no other method. *"Preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent"* is the work of the three grades of resonance; *"indistinctness and profound obscurity"* are the phenomena of the three grades merging.

Scholars should reflect on this carefully, and they will naturally grasp its subtlety.

Preserving the nonexistent is returning to emptiness; only by preserving the nonexistent can one reach the realm of primordial chaos. Hollow and vast, not a single thought arises, the discriminating spirit dissolved, inwardly forgetting the mind, outwardly forgetting the body—this is called the stillness of both body and mind, which is preserving the nonexistent. When spirit and qi unite, the Mysterious Aperture appears, and a wisp of true intention emerges, as if present, as if not. Once the Central Earth is established, guarding this true intention as the Yellow Dame, water and fire naturally merge, metal and wood naturally unite. Safeguarding this single point of true yang, one completes the returned elixir. In a fleeting moment, the qi of a full celestial cycle gathers—this is what is meant by *"the three families meet"* and *"the five phases harmonize,"* which is guarding the existent. This is spoken from the perspective of firing times.

Spirit is formless—yang; qi has form—yin. Yin and yang generate each other, just as existence and nonexistence complete each other. Yang in heaven forms images; yin on earth forms shapes. Thus, *"preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent"* is the harmonization of yin and yang. In postnatal humans, the primordial spirit in the heart has been eroded by the discriminating spirit, so one must first preserve the nonexistent. Preserving the nonexistent means dissolving the discriminating spirit, eliminating the four appearances, and returning to emptiness. The primordial qi in the body has sunk into the Kan trigram, so one must next guard the existent. Guarding the existent means that when one yang returns, one safeguards the Heavenly Heart to generate the medicine. This is spoken from the perspective of principle.

In all Daoist practice, at the outset, spirit and qi must unite, which is the interpenetration of existence and nonexistence. Then, spirit and qi resonate, and existence and nonexistence are no longer established. The numinous platform is pure and still, without existence or nonexistence. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: *"Existence and nonexistence naturally interpenetrate from this—how could mere thinking bring it about?"* This refers to the state where neither existence nor nonexistence is established. Therefore, one must first preserve nonexistence to establish nonexistence before existence can be guarded.

Observing the wondrous with desirelessness, returning to my true emptiness—this is preserving the nonexistent. When existence arises from nonexistence, true essence emerges and the Mysterious Female is established—only then does one respond by guarding the existent. When there is desire, there is an aperture to observe. Thus, preserving the nonexistent is non-action; guarding the existent is action. Preserving the nonexistent is leaving nothing undone; guarding the existent is acting without acting. This is spoken from the perspective of practice.

The preface to the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *"It cannot be guarded with intention, nor sought with non-intention."* The key is that intention must not scatter—this is guarding the existent. Guarding requires that not a single thought arises—this is preserving the nonexistent. Rely on the true intention that is neither intentional nor unintentional to embody existence and nonexistence. Guarding the existent does not mean guarding with intention; preserving the nonexistent does not mean seeking with non-intention.

In the initial application of effort, the practice lies in not allowing a single thought to arise while maintaining an unscattered intention. Yet to maintain an unscattered intention, one must first not allow a single thought to arise. Only by not allowing a single thought to arise can one maintain an unscattered intention. By sustaining an unscattered intention, one can naturally not allow a single thought to arise. The two mutually complete and mutually overcome each other, neither completing nor overcoming.

Scholars should first cultivate sincerity, obtaining true intention that constantly and silently illuminates. When there is existence to guard, thoughts naturally do not arise, and one thereby preserves the nonexistent.

First purify the six consciousnesses, and when the mind merges with emptiness and nothingness, intention naturally becomes sincere and returns to the real. This is the ability to preserve the nonexistent, and thus one can guard the non-existent. This is again spoken from the perspective of initial application of effort.

The four phrases "preserve the nonexistent, guard the existent" encompass such breadth that the entire process of learning the Dao never departs from them. From the perspective of refining essence to transform into qi, this is guarding the existent; refining qi to transform into spirit is preserving the nonexistent. In terms of refining the self, it is preserving the nonexistent; in foundation-building, it is guarding the existent. The seven returns and nine reversions, jade liquid and golden liquid, are all conceived within these four characters.

"Revolving wind blends and unites"—a hundred days’ work proves efficacious. These two lines continue the preceding, referring to the work of the microcosmic orbit, which is the task of foundation-building in a hundred days. Within the fire phases of the microcosmic orbit, "preserving the nonexistent and guarding the existent" constitute the work of producing and obtaining the medicine. Thus, when "revolving wind blends and unites," after a hundred days essence is transformed into qi.

The "wind" is the xun wind; in alchemical practice, the xun wind is true breath. The opening and closing of true breath is called "revolving wind." Revolving means one ascent and one descent, the circulation of the Conception and Governor Vessels. The Dharma Wheel turns along the central Yellow Path, while yang fire advances along the left Black Path, and yin tally retreats along the right Red Path, returning once more to kun—this constitutes one day, cycling without end. As the inner sun and moon move back and forth, the outer sun and moon invert and reverse; yang qi ascends counterflow, which is called "revolving wind." Entering the qian cauldron, yin and yang blend, and true liquid begins to descend to the Yellow Court, congealing into cinnabar.

"Blend" means yin and yang intermingle in chaos; "unite" means lead and mercury intermingle and congeal. The *Four Hundred Characters* states: "Heaven and earth exchange true liquid; sun and moon meet true essence." As such, Bai Yuchan said: "The river chariot ascends straight to Kunlun’s peak." Xiao Zixu said: "The self-so river chariot has turned several hundred times." Revolving wind is the river chariot. One yin and one yang circulate through the six voids, revolving like a wheel, akin to a windmill. The celestial orbit comprises three hundred and sixty degrees; three hundred celestial orbits complete the foundation. In a hundred days of foundation-building, an average of three revolutions occurs each day—this is an approximate figure. True breath is likened to the xun wind, taking its soft subtlety.

Opening and closing in unison, the nine reversions and seven returns restore the primordial, which is the effect of the revolving wind. The nine reversions of qian, kun, zi, and wu involve external blending and union. The seven returns of kan, li, south, and north involve internal blending and union as well. Flowing from wu to ji, the two earths form a jade tablet—this is blending and union. Extracting kan to fill li, returning li to kan—this too is blending and union. Internal and external unite, metal and wood, dragon and tiger intermingle—this too is blending and union. After blending comes union; after union comes blending. Spirit and qi unite in chaos; heart and breath interdepend in profound obscurity. Sun and moon conjoin to form the elixir; heaven and earth conjoin to form the great elixir—all are effects of blending and union.

Yet at the hundred-day threshold of refining the self and building the foundation, the revolving wind blends and unites true yin and yang, hence it is called "a hundred days’ work proves efficacious." "Efficacious" means mysterious and unfathomable, empty yet spiritually luminous. Through a hundred days of work, refining the self becomes consummate, the foundation solid, and one’s original spirit of empty luminosity is restored, while the errant consciousness of deluded thoughts dissipates. The primordial ancestral nature will thereby attain perfect clarity—this is called "foundation-building." "Building" means constructing by eliminating杂念 and nurturing sagely attainment. Through preserving the nonexistent and guarding the existent, the three families of body, heart, and intention meet, blend into one, and generate the primordial true yang qi, circulating ceaselessly to establish the foundation of the elixir.

Its efficacy is like an echo responding to a call or a shadow appearing when a pole is raised. Within a hundred days, achievements become manifest, and the spirit within one’s heart returns to its originally luminous essence—how can this not be called efficacious? However, "a hundred days" is symbolic; in practice, this varies according to the strength or weakness of one’s constitution, age, diligence, or laziness in practice. It may take as little as a month or extend indefinitely. Alchemical classics also state: foundation-building has limits because the microcosmic orbit comprises three hundred revolutions—even performing one per day, it can be completed in a year. Yet refining the self has no fixed term, for it must reach the point where the three grades blend and unite, and the medicine is obtained in an instant before the revolving wind’s celestial orbit can begin. Only with this ebb and flow of ascent and descent does the fire phase of foundation-building arise. After three hundred celestial orbits, the inner elixir naturally forms—this is limited when refining the self is consummate, but unlimited when it is not.

"Silently audience with the Supreme Emperor—a twelve-year ascension." These two lines continue the preceding, referring to the work of refining qi to transform into spirit, which is the year-long nurturing of the macrocosmic orbit. The "Supreme Emperor" is the Emperor of Supreme Purity, the primordial spirit of the Celestial Valley. "Silently audience" means non-action. Body and heart in non-action, spirit and qi unite and naturally return to the upper field. For the hundred-day foundation-building focuses on the lower field; after the seven-day celestial orbit, it shifts to the middle field; when the embryo forms in a year, it moves again from the middle field to reside in the upper field, whence the spirit emerges—hence it is called "a twelve-year ascension."

"A twelve-year cycle" refers to the stellar cycle of a full revolution of the Dipper’s handle, that is, one year. It does not mean one hundred and twelve years as a cycle, but rather the monthly cycle following the Dipper’s handle from zi to hai. This line is most crucial, for the two characters "silently audience" encompass the work of the fire phases.

The *Laozi* states: "Supreme virtue is non-action, not seeking through discernment." Supreme virtue is the body of pure yang and youthful perfection, the primordial ancestral qi that originally resides within. Only by dwelling in reverence and preserving sincerity can one illuminate the heart and see the nature—this is what is meant by "proceeding in tranquility" and "knowing from birth." With body and heart in non-action, spirit and qi achieve all without striving, which is what is meant by "naturally possessing the true fire phases, requiring neither kindling nor fanning."

"Silence" means "the three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth are closed and sealed, not allowing passage." "Audience" means "with my great emptiness, I connect to heaven and earth’s great emptiness; with my heart’s true void, I merge with heaven and earth’s true void." As it is said, "Heaven follows the Dao, the Dao follows spontaneity." In this state, there is nothing to be done—reducing and further reducing—yet the radiance of nature shines forth, extending to the six directions and penetrating heaven and earth. After foundation-building, the physical form has become a youthful body; the departed original spirit has returned, and the leaked original qi has been restored. This is already attaining the primordial within the postnatal; advancing further, one returns to the primordial within the primordial. It is the principle that when gathered, it forms shape, and when dispersed, it becomes qi—yin spirit transforms into yang spirit, filling the cosmos and uniting its virtue with the great void, its brightness with the sun and moon.

This stage is the work of a single word: "stillness." One need only empty the heart and forget the form, transcending self, others, sentient beings, and longevity. All appearances are illusory. Guarding one’s true self naturally brings about the great union of dragon and tiger; preserving one’s nothingness naturally leads to the liberation of the original spirit. Within a year, in profound obscurity, form and spirit transform themselves, and longevity aligns with heaven. This "year" consists of only ten months, excluding the two months of Mao and You for bathing, amounting to three hundred days. Each day completes one celestial orbit, totaling three hundred orbits. During these three hundred days, one need not employ intention or effort—all returns to emptiness, and naturally, spontaneously, one sees the nature, emerges the spirit, and ascends.

"Audience" means unceasing sincerity, storing the spirit in the celestial valley, ascending to the Upper Clarity Palace, where heart and nature commune with the divine. The emperor emerges from *Zhen*, embodying the image of "Qian’s nine-five, the flying dragon in heaven." When the golden light grows as large as a chariot wheel, the yang spirit departs the body and ascends. This is called "form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the true Dao." The final step of returning to emptiness pertains solely to the Dharma-body’s path, unrelated to the cultivation of the ordinary body. Thus, the scripture says, "Herein it ceases," for once attained, it is eternally possessed, and the work of immortality is complete.

The wise grasp it easily; the deluded find it hard to practice. The above outlines the methods of Daoist cultivation, concluding with these two lines, which serve as the guiding principles of the entire scripture.

The three grades of superior medicine harmonize to form the elixir. With a hundred days of foundation-building and a year’s work, one may ascend to the Jade Palace—is this not the simplest and easiest of matters? Yet cultivating the Dao is not difficult; hearing the Dao is difficult. Hearing the Dao is not difficult; believing in the Dao is difficult. The sages of old transmitted it orally, heart to heart, without committing it to writing. Only the superior person, upon receiving the oral instructions, can believe and practice it; the inferior person will merely laugh. Thus, Confucius said, "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening."

"Knowing" is innate knowledge. When knowledge is realized, intention becomes sincere; when intention is sincere, the heart is rectified; when the heart is rectified, the body is cultivated. The cultivation, rectification, and sincerity of body, heart, and intention all rely on the functioning of innate knowledge—exercising innate capacity. Innate knowledge manifests as innate capacity, which is Qian’s "easy to know" and Kun’s "simple in capacity." This is the origin of the saying that "the great Dao is simple and easy." When innate knowledge is not obscured, the great Dao is utterly simple and easy—non-action yet all-accomplishing. With a single moment of awakening, heaven and earth are penetrated.

Innate knowledge is the center; innate capacity is harmony. Perfecting innate knowledge is achieving the mean and harmony. Positioning heaven and earth and nurturing the myriad things—this is the Dao. If innate knowledge is obscured and the acquired spirit dominates, essence, qi, and spirit leak away through the sense roots, becoming seeds of hell. How then can the Dao be practiced?

Innate knowledge is the original spirit’s true awareness. When still, it is profoundly quiescent, undifferentiated and unaware. When stimulated, it responds and communicates—a spark of true sincerity flows forth spontaneously, purely as the music of heaven, following the emperor’s principle. It responds to things without confusion, embodies things without omission, acts without duality, and engenders things beyond measure—this is innate capacity. Innate knowledge and innate capacity are fundamentally one. Innate knowledge is the heart resting in utmost goodness; innate capacity is the place resting in utmost goodness. When knowledge and capacity unite, it is the heart resting in utmost goodness while also resting in the place of utmost goodness.

The heart of utmost goodness is the ultimate in emptiness; the place of utmost goodness is the ultimate in voidness. Precisely because it is empty, the true numen remains unobscured, returning wholly to sincerity, free from the lure of external desires. The primordial true awareness manifests as innate knowledge. Precisely because it is void, it is unstained by a single speck of dust, radiant and reverent, free from the flaw of partiality. The natural spiritual awareness moves as innate capacity, and the Dao resides within.

When knowledge and capacity unite, clarity and brightness abide in the person. Will and qi become spirit-like, "solemn and unceasing, diligent day and night" (see *Shijing*, "Zhou Song," "Wei Tian zhi Ming"). This is why the great person values "knowing to stop."

"Obscuration" arises when the seven emotions and six desires obstruct the center, causing the body and mind to act solely under the sway of acquired consciousness. Even to seek great rest and cessation proves unattainable. This is the human heart in operation, while the Dao-heart is extinguished. Even if one hears the Dao, one may not necessarily believe and practice it—hence it is called "difficult."

From the beginning to this point forms one chapter, elucidating the stages of the great Dao and the medicinal substances and firing times. Below, the initial efforts are discussed in greater detail.

**Treading the celestial radiance, breathing to nurture purity.** This chapter directly describes the initial efforts. These two lines speak of the beginning of refining the self, which lies wholly in true treading and real practice—namely, the Dao of returning from the acquired to the primordial. The meaning is profoundly subtle; here is a detailed explication.

**Celestial radiance** refers to the yang *qi* within the Great Ultimate, what the alchemical texts call "primordial true yang." *Qian* is Heaven, corresponding to Metal in the Five Phases, firm and strong, upright and unceasing. The body of Heaven is utterly void yet utterly numinous, utterly bright, covering all without exception. Thus, yang *qi* is formless yet has image, accumulating to become the sun, illuminating all without exception. The *Yijing* states: "In Heaven, it forms images." These images are the images of light.

In refining the self, the Dao lies in "emptying the heart and filling the abdomen." *Wuzhen pian* says: "Emptying the heart and filling the abdomen both hold profound meaning; it is only to empty the heart that one must recognize the heart. Without knowing to first fill the abdomen with lead, one is taught to guard the hall full of gold." The heart resembles the middle line of *Li*, which is empty—originally the primordial *Qian*. Yet through its union with *Kun*, the middle line sinks into *Kun*, forming *Kan*, while *Qian* becomes empty and transforms into *Li*. Thus, *Li* is the mutation of *Qian*. This shows that the heart originally images Heaven. Since the body of Heaven is void yet spiritually luminous, the heart is no different. Only when the heart is empty can the abdomen be filled; only when the abdomen is filled can the heart be empty. Why? The Dao lies in obtaining the primordial *Qian*-Metal.

Primordial *Qian*-Metal is the correct *qi* that generates Heaven, also called the "original ancestral *qi*" or the "principle-*qi* within the Great Ultimate." This speck of ancestral *qi* originally transcends the Three Realms and Five Phases. Because it accumulates to generate Heaven, it is imaged as true gold and named "firm and strong," taking the meaning of indestructible metal. In those of acquired inferior virtue, the image has shifted from *Qian*-*Kun* to *Kan*-*Li*, with yin and yang mixed, nature and life separated. The nature of temperament dominates, while the heavenly Mandate’s nature lies hidden; the emotions of delusion vanish, while the emotions of desire rage unchecked. To learn to be a great person, one must first undertake the work of "restraining the self," investigating things to extend knowledge, rectifying the heart, and making the intentions sincere. Achieving "sincerity" is the work of emptying the heart. Before the heart can be emptied, one must naturally seek the Dao of restraining the heart—this is the filling of the abdomen with accumulated gold. Gold corresponds to righteousness among the Five Constants, which is "accumulating righteousness to generate the flood-like *qi*." This flood-like correct *qi* is called "true gold" by Daoists. This *qi* arises from the void, entirely dependent on resonance and attraction. With this filling of the abdomen, the guest evils in the heart naturally depart, and desires are spontaneously rectified.

Alchemical texts often employ symbolic language, giving this *qi* myriad names. This scripture, being most ancient, uses few symbolic terms, hence it directly calls it "celestial radiance."

**Treading** refers to *Tianze Lü* (*Yijing*: "Above *Qian*, below *Dui* is *Lü*"). Confucius said: "*Lü* is the foundation of virtue." In practicing the Dao, one begins with *Lü*. The *Lü* hexagram’s *Nine in the First Place* states: "Treading on a tiger’s tail, it does not bite the person." The tiger is the white tiger of *Dui*-Metal. *Wuzhen pian* says: "The white tiger’s first channel is the supreme treasure, the divine water of the Flowery Pond, true gold." Primordial true yang is precisely this "first channel of the white tiger." Obtaining it leads to accomplishment; failing to obtain it leads to ruin.

True gold is originally the primordial *Qian*-origin, formless and without substance, born from the midst of emptiness and nothingness, concealed in the profound and unfathomable depths. Thus, alchemical texts symbolically say it is born within *Kun*. *Kun* is utter emptiness; it is stored within *Dui*, and *Dui* is utter depth. Guangchengzi said: "Brilliant, it emerges from Heaven yet reaches that most yin of origins." This true yang emerges from above Heaven yet is actually born below Earth. *Kun* is Earth, the old yin; old yin does not nurture, so young yin takes *Kun*’s place in service. *Dui* is marsh, young yin. *Qian* pertains to Metal, and *Dui* also pertains to Metal; *Qian* is yang, *Dui* is yin; *Qian* moves, *Dui* is still. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and yang is born within yin; when movement reaches its extreme, stillness arises, and yin is born within yang. Hard and soft push and pull, cycling endlessly like a ring. Thus, primordial yang *qi* is born within *Kun* and *Dui*.

The first yang’s arrival is *Dilei Fu*, the initial stirring of the celestial heart. The second yang’s birth is *Dize Lin*, the celestial heart now revealed. This is precisely the time to apply fire, when one should tread and practice in reality. Both treading and practicing are spoken of in terms of Earth, while *Tianze* (*Lü*) is the image of inner yin summoning outer yang. Daoists say: "Enter the tiger’s den to seize the tiger’s cub." The tiger’s cub is water. In the primordial, water is the *qi* of Heaven’s One, the initial stirring of principle-*qi* within the Great Ultimate. This *qi* accumulates to generate Heaven, hence it is called "primordial." With the Five Phases inverted, water returns to generate Metal, becoming "Metal within water."

The "tiger’s tail" is the first line of *Dui*; the "white tiger’s true gold" belongs to the yang within *Qian*. Thus, when it appears in *Dui*, it is like a tiger’s tail.

Grasping this mechanism, the cycles of generation and destruction reverse. Treading upon the tiger’s tail incurs no misfortune, and it naturally ceases to bite. Moreover, *Qian* corresponds to the human head, while *Dui* corresponds to the mouth and tongue. The mouth is the gate of ingress and egress, containing five yang lines with one yin at its center—thus bearing the image of a gate. When scholars begin with the *Lü* hexagram and truly practice the *Kun* hexagram’s principle of "circulating through the six voids," they may attain the yang of "Heavenly Light," which is precisely what is meant by "the medicine." Some claim that "Heavenly Light" (*Tian guang*) is a corruption of "Heavenly Heart" (*Tian xin*), and this interpretation is also quite sound. Yet yang forms images, while yin forms shapes: the sun, moon, and stars, adorned in the heavens, all possess light; mountains, rivers, and seas, borne upon the earth, all possess form. The original countenance of *Qian*’s primordiality, singular and true, shines forth in solitary radiance—this is the advent of true yang, and it also presents the scene of "an empty chamber generating brightness," hence the term "Heavenly Light" is indeed fitting.

The following line connects to the preceding, speaking of the wondrous efficacy of true treading and practice, which is most crucial. These four characters encompass the entire work, serving as the secret transmission of the heart-mind. Breathing refers to the inhalation and exhalation through the mouth and nose, yet it distinguishes between the true person and the ordinary person. *Zhuangzi* states: "The true person breathes from the heels, while the ordinary person breathes from the throat." The heel signifies deep and profound respiration; true breathing is embryonic breathing, internal respiration, the inner sun and moon—an affair of the primordial. Mouth-and-nose breathing is external respiration, ordinary breath, the outer sun and moon—an affair of the acquired. The sun and moon alternate in their comings and goings, giving rise to the four seasons; breathing alternates in its comings and goings, giving rise to human longevity—both take their images from the *Kan* and *Li* hexagrams, which are the primordial *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* moves and closes, *Kun* is still and opens; one closing and one opening is called transformation, ceaseless coming and going is called penetration. Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* bear the image of a gate, and the space between heaven and earth resembles a bellows.

The Great Void uses heaven and earth as its embryo and the sun and moon as its breath, thereby achieving undying circulation. Humans use *qi* as their breath. With each inhalation, one steals the *qi* of heaven, earth, and the myriad things to make it their own; with each exhalation, heaven, earth, and the myriad things steal one’s *qi* to make it their own. *Qi* circulates throughout the bodily form, commanding the five senses, the hundred bones, the four limbs, and the nine orifices to accomplish movement. When *qi* is exhausted, the person dies, and breathing ceases. Thus, the bodily form’s existence depends on this *qi*, and this *qi*’s ceaseless coming and going depends on this breath. *Qi* originally comes from without, yet humans rely on it to live; with each inhalation and exhalation, it becomes the root of the four great elements and the body’s life—how weighty indeed!

External respiration governs tangible *qi*, which belongs to earth and is inherently heavy and turbid; internal respiration governs intangible *qi*, which issues from heaven and is inherently light and pure. At birth, humans first possess the embryonic breathing of internal respiration, then draw in tangible *qi* through the nostrils. Once internal respiration ceases, the acquired state begins, and the numinous clarity of the primordial becomes hidden and unseen. This external respiration, with its inhalations and exhalations, sustains the bodily form’s life; yet the true root of life still lies in internal respiration. The fetal breathing of the unborn child and the true breathing of the true person are both internal respiration. What is called "true breathing" resides an inch and three-tenths below the navel, where primordial *qi* congeals in formlessness, revolving like a wheel. When true breathing moves spontaneously, primordial *qi* reaches the four limbs, descending to the "Bubbling Spring" and ascending to the "Mud Pill," rising behind and descending in front, transforming into true fluid that falls into the "Yellow Court," accumulating to form the elixir—thus, true breathing is the foundation of Daoist cultivation.

Elixirists speak of "exhaling to connect with the Heavenly Root, inhaling to connect with the Earthly Root," which is the pathway of primordial *qi*’s circulation. In acquired humans, embryonic breathing has long ceased, leaving only mouth-and-nose respiration. The work of refining the self is the work of breathing primordial *qi* to seek immortality. The four characters "breathing to nurture purity" (*huxi yu qing*) also convey this meaning. "Nurture" (*yu*) means to gestate; "purity" (*qing*) refers to the primordial *qi* of true breathing, which is the true breath gestated from within external respiration. For tangible *qi* and intangible *qi* originally share a single source. When mouth-and-nose breathing ceases, true breathing arises spontaneously within the body; yet only when the mind’s deluded thoughts are entirely extinguished does mouth-and-nose breathing cease.

The principle of returning to emptiness is precisely the cessation of thoughts and breath, extending to the cessation of pulse and breathlessness. Chen Niniwa said: "After a year of practicing the work, the six pulses had already stopped, and *qi* returned to the root." Returning to the root means reverting from ordinary breath to true breath. The method lies in the embrace of spirit and *qi*, forging them into one, whereupon nasal breathing becomes faint and indistinct, primordial *qi* steams and rises, and the Dharma Wheel turns ceaselessly. Emerging from the mysterious and entering the female, as if absent, as if present—these two lines continue the preceding, describing the state of true breathing’s establishment, while the four characters "mysterious" and "female" (*xuan pin*) subtly encompass the meaning of the gate.

Viewing the wondrous and the aperture as one, neither existence nor non-existence is established—only then does the medicine arise in the mysterious aperture. The mysterious is yang, heaven, *Qian*; the female is yin, earth, *Kun*. The mysterious is true emptiness yet wondrous existence; the female is wondrous existence yet true emptiness. In elixir texts, the characters "mysterious" and "female" are of utmost importance.

Bai Yuchan said, "Where the thought stirs, there is the *xuan pin*." Zhang Ziyang said, "It is entirely upon the *xuan pin* that the foundation is established." He also said, "One must neither guard with intent nor seek with absence of mind." Lü Chunyang said:

"*Xuan pin*, *xuan pin*, true *xuan pin*—
Neither in the heart nor in the kidneys.
Speaking of the moment when one receives *qi* at birth,
Blame not the celestial mechanism for being wholly revealed."

Thus, the *xuan pin* is not an aperture within the human body but rather the moment when one receives *qi* at birth. The *xuan pin* is the foundation upon which the cultivator achieves the Dao. What is called "laying the foundation" (*zhu ji*) is but the laying of this; "refining the self" (*lian ji*) is but the refining of this; "obtaining the medicine" (*de yao*) is but the obtaining of this; "conceiving the embryo" (*jie tai*) is but the conceiving of this. The *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states, "The medicine and substances arise in the *xuan* aperture." The *xuan* aperture is the *xuan pin*; the *pin* is the aperture. It is also called the "mysterious pass" (*xuan guan*) or the "gate of *xuan pin*." However, the "mysterious pass" and the "gate of *xuan pin*" refer specifically to a single aperture, whereas the term "*xuan pin*" encompasses a broader meaning.

"Exiting the *xuan* and entering the *pin*" is exiting yang and entering yin, exiting existence and entering non-existence. Since it is spoken of as exiting and entering, there must be a gate, an inner and outer aspect. In general terms, exiting is from within to without, and entering is from without to within. Yet the elixir classics also speak of "inner *xuan pin*" and "outer *xuan pin*," while the *Yellow Court Classic* states, "Exiting the clear and entering the *xuan*, the two *qi* interchange"—this appears to differ. Why? The term *xuan pin* truly conveys the meaning of "generating existence from non-existence." For when things reach the utmost emptiness and mystery, there is the primordial true yang, which arises from the formless, unfathomably subtle—hence it is called "*xuan pin*."

"Exiting the *xuan*" is exhaling to connect with the root of heaven; "entering the *pin*" is inhaling to connect with the root of earth—both refer to the movement of true breathing and the ascent and descent of primordial *qi*. Because there is the semblance of exhalation and inhalation, it is metaphorically called exiting and entering. In truth, there is no exiting or entering, nor is there anything that does not exit or enter. With each exhalation, yang ascends—this is exiting the *xuan*; with each inhalation, yin descends—this is entering the *pin*. It is not called ascending and descending but exiting and entering because its ebb and flow are entirely within the gate, that is, the "gate of *xuan pin*." "Exiting the clear and entering the *xuan*" advances this meaning further. Entering the *pin* to generate the *xuan* is called "entering the *xuan*"; from the *xuan*, ascending to the first peak of Penglai is called "exiting the clear."

In sum, the *xuan pin* is true yin and true yang, the true breathing of exhalation and inhalation, circulating the microcosmic orbit within the formless: exhaling ascends from the gate of *xuan pin*, and inhaling descends into the gate of *xuan pin*. True yang meets true yin at the *xuan* gate; true yin unites with true yang at the *pin* aperture. Internally, *Kan* and *Li* intermingle; externally, the Dao and its power intermingle. Where the celestial heart is restored—there is the *xuan pin*. The foundation of Dao cultivation lies entirely in this.

The four characters "as if absent, as if present" (*ruo wang ruo cun*) pertain to the work of fire timing. Mencius’s "neither forget nor force," Confucius’s "neither obstinate, certain, willful, nor self-centered," as well as Yao’s "tranquil tranquility," King Wen’s "harmonious harmony," and the Duke of Zhou’s "ceasing ceasing"—all are methods of nurturing *qi* through fire timing. "Forgetting" and "preserving" are the same as "as if absent, as if present." Regulating postnatal breathing to seek true breathing lies entirely between intent and non-intent. For intent clings to form, and absence of mind falls into emptiness—neither suffices to generate the medicine or establish the *xuan* aperture. Even in "exiting the *xuan* and entering the *pin*," one must maintain "as if present, as if absent." For to preserve is to overdo, and to forget is to fall short—neither suffices to refine lead and draw forth mercury. Only these four characters deeply accord with the principle of natural spiritual breathing. Dissolving knowledge and purely following nature, the alchemical furnace will naturally possess the appropriate fire timing. As Ancestor Lü said:

"Rest not the river chariot of the elixir hearth,
For the crane’s embryo and the turtle’s breath flow ceaselessly."

"Ceaseless and unbroken, the root deepens and the stem firms"—these two lines closely follow "as if present, as if absent." For "ceaseless and unbroken" means intermittent yet continuous, as if present yet as if absent—this is precisely "as if present, as if absent." "Ceaseless" (*mianmian*) describes extreme length and fineness, connecting above to the root of nature and extending below to the stem of life. In the realm of profound obscurity, there is not a single breath that does not reach the heels. As Laozi said, "Ceaseless and unbroken, its use is never exhausted." The *Classic of Embryonic Breathing* states, "Exhale only subtly, inhale only ceaselessly." Both are methods of regulating the breath, which is the way of "exiting the *xuan* and entering the *pin*." Day after day, moment after moment, in movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, never departing for an instant—with long and persistent practice, the root naturally deepens and the stem naturally firms.

The root is the root of nature, the celestial root; the stem is life, the earthly root. At birth, one receives the ancestral *qi* of *Qian* as one’s nature and the primordial *qi* of *Kun* as one’s life. The root of nature is the abode of the valley spirit; the stem of life is the root of true breathing, also called the homeland of long-embryo abiding breath. Only through exiting the *xuan* and entering the *pin* do the root and stem daily deepen and firm, nature and life daily harmonize. When root and stem unite, the three revolutions become one, and the embryo is formed.

This is the second chapter, which comprehensively discusses the initial work of Dao cultivation. For the great Dao is simple and easy—there is no other method. Through this practice alone, one may ascend to the Jade Capital and roam freely in the heavens.

Each person possesses essence, and essence unites with spirit. This chapter first expounds the origins of the three treasures and the wondrous function of the primordial spirit, thereby revealing the mystery of "converging the three into one" in the text that follows—making this the most essential passage in this *Scripture*. Moreover, it encompasses the postnatal spirit, *qi*, and essence within the primordial spirit, *qi*, and essence, demonstrating to people the Dao of "borrowing the false to cultivate the true."

The phrase "each person possesses essence" speaks from the inception of the postnatal physical form. The *Book of Changes* states, "When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born" (see *Xici* II). The *Cantong Qi* says: "At the receiving of life, the body is originally non-being; primordial essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* to establish its beginning." When a person is first born, they receive *qi* from heaven as their nature and are endowed with *qi* from earth to initiate the formation of the embryo, where nature and life unite as one Supreme Ultimate. After ten months, primordial essence responds and enters, occupying the central palace of the spirit chamber to become one’s master, thus giving rise to the physical body. From then on, one can eat, move, speak, act with benevolence and righteousness, passing through infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age, until death returns one to emptiness. Over several decades, countless deeds are accomplished through this body. Yet tracing back to its very beginning, it arises simply from the union of the two passions of father and mother, where formless *qi* is stirred to form the physical body. The physical body of form is constituted by the union of tangible procreative essence, while the formless numinous *qi* is bestowed by the intangible principle-*qi*. Postnatal awareness is governed by primordial essence, which activates the senses and orifices. This body is truly formed of essence. Primordial essence, though formless, is also a thing of the prior heaven; in the postnatal realm, it is called "consciousness." This consciousness, when employed to serve the body and indulge worldly desires, may lead to endless descent; when turned inward to dissolve worldly affairs, it may enable one to become a sage or immortal. In the postnatal body, consciousness acts as the master, and whether one is wise or foolish, worthy or unworthy, all are the same in this regard. Each person has their own consciousness, and thus each has their own primordial essence—what Buddhism calls the "mind-made body."

"Essence unites with spirit" refers to the postnatal person, where the primordial spirit has deeply concealed itself in the realm of the unseen and unheard, while primordial essence enters the central palace of the spirit chamber to govern the movements of body and mind. The spirit of our heart has no outward manifestation; it is only through the movement of intention that it becomes apparent, hence it is also called the "spirit of consciousness." The primordial spirit is originally the substance of emptiness, undifferentiated and unaware. When primordial essence enters and stirs, awareness arises, and this unaware primordial spirit then sinks into consciousness, remaining unseen throughout one’s life. Only after death does the spirit return to its formless state, hence it is said to be "neither born nor destroyed." Those who cultivate the Dao must recover this primordial spirit, and thus we speak of it separately. In truth, the primordial spirit is formless and without substance, invisible and intangible; only when emptiness is utmost and stillness profound can its original face be restored. Therefore, the alchemical texts also say: "Stillness is the primordial spirit; movement is primordial essence." This phrase "essence unites with spirit" likewise conveys this meaning—it speaks of primordial essence entering the body and uniting with the spirit within.

Tracing back to the principle of the Supreme Ultimate, spirit is one, while essence is three. The one resides at the center of the Supreme Ultimate, while the three reside within the Two Modes. The position of the three is the position of the one; the position of the one is the position of the five. The *Cantong Qi* states: "The three, five, and one are the purest essence of heaven and earth. They may be transmitted orally but are difficult to convey in writing." For the one, three, and five all reside at the center of the Supreme Ultimate, the primordial *qi* from which the myriad things are born. In humans, primordial essence moves as intention, and intention pertains to the central earth—thus one becomes three, and three becomes five. Moreover, spirit and *qi* unite to generate essence, and when essence moves, spirit moves. For example, when male and female engage in intercourse, the spirit must first be stirred, after which *qi* arrives and essence is produced. Within the human body, there is yin essence that nourishes it. Yin essence is the refined essence transformed from the five grains and food. This essence in the body maintains the luster of the skin and flesh; when this essence is exhausted, the person becomes emaciated. Additionally, there is the essence of sexual union—procreative essence. This essence arises from sexual stimulation; at the moment of union, the heart-spirit is agitated, rushing into the Gate of Life, and the primordial *qi* follows, surging through the spinal marrow to transform into essence and be released. Thus, those who indulge in lust often suffer from aching backs and waists, for their primordial *qi* and spinal marrow are depleted. The existence of the body also depends on this essence, which overflows due to the stirring of the heart-spirit—thus the essence of sexual union is fundamentally united with the spirit of our heart.

Spirit unites with *qi*, and *qi* unites with the true body. The preceding sentence continues to describe the function of spirit and *qi*; the following sentence speaks of the marvel of returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. Together with the two preceding sentences, it clarifies the Dao of seeking the Dharma-body through the physical body—all is naturally operative, requiring no artificial cultivation. When essence unites with spirit, intention moves and *qi* moves; when *qi* moves, essence moves. Initially, movement begins with formless essence, and ultimately, it moves with tangible essence. The three treasures circulate and transform to generate the myriad things—such is the profound mystery of the Dao. Spirit is formless and belongs to yang; *qi* is tangible and belongs to yin; essence is born from the union of yin and yang.

The Dao gives birth to the One, and the One is spirit; the One gives birth to the Two, and the Two is *qi*; the Two gives birth to the Three, which is essence. The Three is formed by the union of the One and the Two, and thus essence may encompass both spirit and *qi*. Spirit, in the prenatal state, is the master of all transformations; in the postnatal state, it resides within primordial essence. The movement and stillness of *qi*, in turn, follow the activity and quiescence of spirit—when spirit moves, *qi* moves; when *qi* moves, essence is generated. The nature and life of humans consist of nothing but one spirit and one *qi*. When spirit and *qi* unite, they produce essence, which attaches to the physical body and governs it. In the prenatal state, primordial spirit is originally empty and true, primordial *qi* is subtly existent, while primordial essence stands neither in being nor non-being, yet interpenetrates both. This is why essence is spoken of first (possibly a redundant repetition). In the postnatal body, primordial spirit and primordial *qi* are deeply concealed and unseen; only primordial essence may still be sought in stillness. The initial practice begins with refining essence into *qi*, which is to return from essence to primordial *qi*. Once primordial *qi* is attained, one then seeks primordial spirit within it—this is called "refining *qi* into spirit," which is truly the method of uniting *qi* and merging the Two into the One. When the Three Treasures unite, the Two Modes return to the Supreme Ultimate, and from the Supreme Ultimate, one returns to the original face of prenatal true emptiness—this is called "refining spirit to return to emptiness," also known as "the utmost truth." The utmost truth is yang spirit: when quiescent and unmoving, it is emptiness; when responsive and freely flowing, it is subtle existence. Radiant, pure, and unfathomably transformative, Daoists commonly call it "the True," while Confucians name it "spirit," as in "what is so sagely as to be unknowable is called spirit." "Spirit is that by which the myriad things are wondrously spoken of." This formless body is called the "pure Dharma-body"; in terms of its transformations, it is called the "transformation body," which is truly the expansion and magnification of the heavenly-endowed nature, transcending the Three Realms to become one with the Great Void.

This passage establishes its discourse in four stages: when the adept refines essence into *qi*, refines *qi* into spirit, and refines spirit to return to emptiness, the Dharma-body is completed, becoming the body of the utmost truth. Yet this body of the utmost truth is in reality but the wondrous function of one spirit. Dissolving the postnatal consciousness of primordial essence to restore the primordial spirit originally endowed, and uniting it with primordial *qi* to transmute turbid yin into pure yang, the Dharma-body is fully perfected. This is the meeting of the Three Teachings, where primordial true *yi*-*qi* is gathered, congealed, and harmonized to obtain the yang elixir—hence it is said, "*qi* unites with the true body." The preceding three sentences must be interpreted in continuity to be readily understood; otherwise, the final phrase "true body" lacks foundation. Primordial essence and primordial *qi* are both encompassed within primordial spirit, fully manifesting the wondrous function of one spirit. Indeed, primordial spirit is originally pure yang *qi*, of the same kind as the principle-*qi* that first arises in the Supreme Ultimate and gives birth to heaven and earth. When vast and luminous, it unites in virtue with heaven and earth, and in brightness with the sun and moon.

The *Scripture* states: "Essence unites with spirit, spirit unites with *qi*." It firmly establishes spirit as the master that guides *qi* and refines essence, and the repeated use of "spirit" reveals its subtlety. Primordial spirit is undifferentiated, the pure embodiment of the prenatal state. In postnatal humans, primordial essence occupies the chamber of spirit, transforming emptiness into existence, stillness into movement, nature into emotion, obscuring true numinosity and giving rise to the six senses and seven emotions. Thus, one daily descends further, suffering the cycles of birth, aging, sickness, and death. If one can attain emptiness and preserve stillness, eliminating worldly desires to return to the undifferentiated state, innate knowledge may naturally be restored. Seizing this opportunity to nurture it, primordial spirit may be recovered. When primordial spirit returns, primordial *qi* naturally harmonizes, and the yin spirit of primordial essence is spontaneously transformed. How wondrous is the function of spirit!

Without attaining the true, all are but forced designations. These two sentences further explain that primordial essence, primordial *qi*, and primordial spirit are all prenatal entities; when united, they form the true, but without this union, essence, *qi*, and spirit are all mere illusions. Why is this so? In the postnatal physical body, the consciousness-spirit dominates, primordial *qi* lies concealed, and life depends on the breath of mouth and nose, the water and grains that generate turbid essence. Within the body, nothing but turbid yin is gathered; the prenatal formless Three Treasures of the supreme medicine lie hidden in obscurity, unseen. Though named essence, *qi*, and spirit, they lack the reality of essence, *qi*, and spirit. These are merely three tangible, visible things forcibly called essence, *qi*, and spirit, capable only of sustaining the body for several decades but unfit for use as the supreme medicine in elixir refinement—hence it is said, "without attaining the true."

Spirit can enter stone, spirit can make the body fly. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning.

The preceding four lines expound the marvels of the yang spirit, completing the emphasis on the word "spirit" in the previous section. The spirit, by nature formless, belongs to yang in its essence. In the postnatal realm, it becomes entangled with emotions and consciousness, obscured by turbid yin, and thus loses its function of emptiness and numinosity. In the prenatal state, the original spirit’s body is fundamentally true emptiness, giving rise to the ten thousand existences. It walks with the sun and moon without casting a shadow, enters metal and stone without form. Because it is empty, there is nowhere it cannot penetrate; because it is numinous, there is nowhere it does not succeed. Above, it reaches the nine heavens; below, it descends to the nine abysses. When released, it pervades the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy—all is the circulation of the primordial *qi*. The dharmakāya of the yang spirit, when concentrated, takes form like a human body; when dispersed, it becomes *qi*, returning to emptiness. Thus, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot harm it, blades and weapons cannot pierce it, water and fire cannot injure it.

Moreover, the spirit is the master of the body, the root of spirit and essence. Essence and *qi* achieve their marvelous harmony through the spirit—hence the *Yijing* says, "Essence enters the spirit." Once the original spirit recovers its emptiness and numinosity, it follows the heart’s desires, responding with boundless subtlety. Thus, even the physical body can transform in accordance with the spirit: when the spirit rises, the body rises; when the spirit conceals itself, the body conceals itself. This is the origin of the ancient "art of invisibility." To live or die is as one wishes—Confucius said, "Hear the Dao in the morning, and you may die in the evening!" *The Awakening to Reality* says, "My life is governed by me, not by Heaven." The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states, "Pure thought can fly," and the *Sūtra* says, "The spirit can make the body fly." All these speak of the body’s marvelous transformation following the spirit.

The spirit’s wondrous functions can be observed in moments of human peril. When one encounters disasters of water or fire, even objects weighing a thousand pounds can be lifted; walls a thousand fathoms high can be leapt down from. This is the effect of single-minded focus, forgetting the body. Only by concentrating wholly on the original spirit does one forget the physical form, and thus this body may become deathless. Formerly, when Shenxiu sent someone to assassinate the Sixth Patriarch, the sword struck his head but could not harm him. When a lay monk set fire to burn Jigong, the temple burned to ashes, yet he remained unharmed. The *Complete Book of Anshi* records: "A monk obtained several pounds of Solomon’s seal, intending to consume it for longevity, though he did not know whether it would be effective. He first sent someone into a dry well, where the Solomon’s seal was stored, and as soon as the person entered, he covered the well with a millstone. Unable to escape, the person resigned himself to death. Suddenly, a fox in the millstone’s hole spoke: ‘The spirit can make the body fly. Simply focus your mind single-mindedly, gaze at the hole in the stone, and after seven days, you will naturally fly out. We who cultivate the Dao first refine the body. We dig into ancient tombs and lie down, gazing upward. Over time, both body and spirit transform.’ The person followed this advice, and on the eighth day, he indeed flew out through the stone’s hole. The monk, seeing this, rejoiced greatly, believing it to be the effect of the Solomon’s seal. He then leapt into the well, and his disciples covered it again with the millstone. After several days, he died."

The *Master of Supreme Roaming* records: "A certain adept could enter fire unharmed and enter water without drowning. The Master of Supreme Roaming summoned him and asked about this. The adept said, ‘I have no other marvel; I only know how to forget the body. Formerly, I received my teacher’s instructions: when practicing arts in water, regard the body as withered wood, the hands and feet as rotten branches; when entering fire, regard the body as mountain stone, the hands and feet as clumps of earth. With single-minded focus, water and fire naturally cannot harm you.’" These are all proofs of forgetting the body and employing the spirit. If an adept, through momentary concentration of spirit, can achieve such effects, how much more will a cultivator who maintains the spirit throughout attain ascension on rosy clouds!

The spirit depends on the body to arise; essence depends on *qi* for fullness. Unwithering and undecaying, the pine and cypress remain evergreen. These four lines complete the meaning of this chapter, expounding how essence, *qi*, and spirit become abundant. The spirit is fundamentally utterly empty, and only by attaching to form does it have agency. Before a person is born, there is nothing at all; once born, the spirit immediately depends on it. The body is the spirit’s dwelling; the spirit is the body’s master. The spirit in heaven is merely a point of principle-*qi* that ceaselessly generates life. When a person receives this to form an embryo, it becomes the mandate of heaven, endowed as one’s nature. Nature, in true emptiness, nurtures wondrous existence, governing from the center to enact its transformations, thereby preserving the body. Thus, speaking from its emptiness, it is called nature; speaking from its wondrousness, it is called spirit. That by which humans are more numinous than the myriad things is precisely this spirit.

In the prenatal state, the spirit is merged with the great void, without color or form, without substance or function—its numinosity cannot be perceived. Only when it attaches to form do true emptiness and wondrous existence mutually serve as substance and function. Form is not different from emptiness; emptiness is not different from form. Though its substance cannot be seen, its function manifests in the world. That which depends on form to arise is called spirit. Before birth, it is pure emptiness, without the name of spirit.

Essence is the congealing of the marvelous harmony of spirit and *qi*. The body of youthful purity possesses only original *qi*, without the essence of intercourse. Once emotions and consciousness arise, the spirit scatters and *qi* moves, generating the essence of intercourse. Thus, the Buddha speaks of a single point of yang essence, hidden in the mountain of form, and also says it is not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the One Aperture. (Note: The Buddha says, "I have a treasure, hidden in the mountain of form." The Dao says, "The prenatal single point of yang essence is not in the heart or kidneys, but in the One Aperture of the mysterious pass.")

The One Aperture is that moment when "earth thunder" returns in *fu* (hexagram 24), where spirit and *qi* unite to generate the supreme medicine. Within this aperture lies the primordial undifferentiated essence—primal yang *qi*—which, when harmonized and congealed with the spirit of the heart, becomes the nurturing womb. The waxing and waning of yang essence depend entirely on the fullness of original *qi*; the movement and stillness of original *qi*, in turn, follow the activity and quiescence of original spirit. Original spirit dwells within form, and original *qi* adheres to it, accompanied by true essence. That spirit relies on form to manifest its numinosity is due to *qi*’s capacity to animate the body. Even postnatal emotions and consciousness—what are they if not the transmission of *qi* within emptiness? Original *qi* and spirit are like tallying tokens, sharing a single origin under different names, both called the mysterious. Thus, original spirit knows no birth or death, nor does original *qi*. When form decays, spirit returns to true emptiness, and *qi* reverts to the great void.

Moreover, at the inception of life, nature and destiny are one: spirit resides within *qi*, and *qi* circulates within spirit, with no distinction between them. Only after the postnatal body is ruptured do spirit and *qi* separate. The cultivator begins by emptying to the utmost and stilling profoundly, generating being from non-being to recover the prenatal spirit and *qi*, seeking the undifferentiated primordial essence. This method mirrors the principle by which, in the union of male and female, the primordial *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate is spontaneously engendered through effortless resonance. Spirit and *qi*, in truth, are without birth or death: when united, they form the yang spirit, merging with emptiness to become indestructible; when sundered, they return to the void, not abandoning the bodily form but reverting to it, only then called original spirit and original *qi*. Tracing their origin, they are fundamentally imperishable, like the pine and cypress that remain verdant year-round. If one nurtures spirit, preserves *qi*, and secures essence, this bodily form will likewise flourish like the pine and cypress, attaining longevity and enduring years. This is what is meant by "form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth."

From "each person possesses essence" onward constitutes a single chapter, comprehensively discussing the three grades of the great medicine and their relation to the human body, while also touching upon the wondrous principle of the three returning to one and the transcendence of the yang spirit. "Spirit depends on form to arise," hence "spirit can make form take flight"; "essence waxes with *qi*," hence "*qi* unites with the true body." Thus, though the Dharma-body is not the physical body, those who cultivate the Dharma-body cannot depart from the physical body. This is why yin spirits and ghostly immortals struggle to endure, and why the practice of Dao cultivation and Chan meditation must begin with the physical form. The subtleties herein are "easily grasped by the wise" but "difficult to practice for the benighted."

The three grades share a single principle, ineffable in its wonder. When gathered, they exist; when scattered, they dissipate. This is the teaching of the three grades uniting to form the elixir. The "three grades sharing a single principle" means that original spirit, original *qi*, and original essence merge into one, restoring the prenatal Supreme Ultimate’s original state: stillness is true emptiness, movement is wondrous being—wondrous being is the principle-*qi* within the Supreme Ultimate. Principle-*qi* transforms endlessly, giving rise to the ten thousand things, hence called "wondrous being." The principle-*qi* of the Supreme Ultimate, when differentiated, becomes the three grades of original spirit, original *qi*, and original essence; when united, they remain the Dao of generating the one. The cultivator cultivates nothing but this; the attainer attains nothing but this. The three grades all emerge from the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate, originally a single *qi* in the prenatal state.

Thus, if the cultivator takes spirit as primary, they refine essence and *qi* to return to original spirit; if they take *qi* as primary, they refine spirit and essence to return to original *qi*; if they take essence as primary, they refine spirit and *qi* to return to original essence. Terms like "the three origins merging," "the three families meeting," "the three essences uniting in *qi*," "gathering the three natures in the original palace," and "flying the three elixirs to the purple court" all convey this meaning, their wonder beyond words. The ancients spoke of "the Dao of the three-in-one": when the three unite, they return to the one; when the three are forgotten, the one is known. *Laozi* said, "Attain the one, and all affairs are complete." The three grades of the supreme medicine are this one.

The work of fire times and effort is entirely a natural process, not contrived through artificial means. It has been transmitted orally from mouth to mouth, imprinted from heart to heart. That no discourse is established is because it truly cannot be spoken, having no means of expression. The Buddhist school says that in teaching the Dharma, there is in fact no Dharma to teach; the Confucian school says, "The nature and the Dao of Heaven cannot be heard." For the Dao is but a forced name: being generated from non-being, the three grades return to emptiness, and only then is the one attained. With the one attained, the three grades naturally reside within it. If one relies on written words, then ten thousand phrases and a thousand sayings cannot explain it. The sages of the three teachings resolve it with a single word: "wondrous." Indeed, the wondrous cannot be exhausted by speech.

The character *yan* (言) here may be interpreted as "to hear," but I follow another version in reading it as "to speak." When the three grades return to the one, they form the yang elixir, also called the spirit elixir or yang spirit—the primordial supremely yang body, eternally indestructible, unperishing even when heaven and earth collapse. The Buddhist canon states, "That which has form will ultimately decay; only the formless is true." The yang spirit moves in and out, penetrating earth and connecting with heaven, following the heart’s desire. When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it becomes *qi*. In quiescent stillness, it reverts to the formless emptiness; when responsive and unobstructed, it assumes the true form of manifest presence: this is the wondrous function of the three grades uniting in a single principle.

If the three grades scatter and are lost, they enter into profound obscurity. They cannot be perceived in a lifetime, and one drifts through the cycles of birth and death, the bodily form withering away as a result.

The seven apertures interconnect, each aperture radiant with light. The sacred sun and sacred moon illuminate the Golden Court. This further expounds that when the Great Elixir is accomplished, golden light suffuses the body, and when one aperture opens, all apertures open. After the adept completes the Great Celestial Circuit, the yin demons within the body are entirely dispelled, transforming into the yang spirit. When the golden light at the crown of the head becomes as vast as a chariot wheel, this signals the moment of spirit emergence. The eyes, ears, mouth, and nose—these four roots together form the seven apertures. At this time, the yang spirit flows through the seven apertures, each becoming a gateway for its entry and exit. Thus, all seven apertures are luminous and unobstructed, all connecting with the Great Void. The reason for this lies in the "sacred sun and sacred moon" illuminating the Golden Court. The "Golden Court" is none other than the Yellow Court, which pertains to earth, and earth generates metal. At this stage, the body returns to pure yang, and the Yellow Court is filled with the yang *qi* of Qian metal, hence it is called the "Golden Court." The sacred sun and sacred moon are the true light of Kan and Li: the sacred sun is the original spirit, and the sacred moon is the original *qi*. When the original spirit and original *qi* harmonize and coalesce into the numinous elixir, their radiance illuminates the Yellow Court. Spirit inherently belongs to fire, and *qi* inherently belongs to metal; fire shines and metal gleams, and therein lies the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Thus it is said, "illuminating the Golden Court."

The Golden Court is the master gate of the seven apertures, and its light naturally extends into them. The spirit of the Yellow Court governs all spirits; when the Yellow Court is filled with golden *qi*, all spirits within the body transform their yin into yang, and the function of the yang elixir is vast indeed. Once attained, it is eternally possessed, and the body naturally becomes light. Supreme harmony overflows, and the bones turn to cold jade. This speaks of the wondrousness of attaining the elixir. The elixir is the sacred sun and sacred moon united as one. The ancient character for "elixir" (*dan*) is composed of the characters for "sun" and "moon," sharing the same meaning as the characters for "ease" (*yi*) and "brightness" (*ming*). Though this elixir is not easily obtained, once attained, it is eternally possessed without loss, and the true numen communes with heaven and earth. Thus, the *Xici* of the *Yijing* states: "The great person harmonizes their virtue with heaven and earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, and their auspices and misfortunes with ghosts and spirits. They precede heaven yet heaven does not oppose them; they follow heaven yet accord with its timing." For the elixir is the union of sun and moon, which is "the Dao of one yin and one yang." The union of yin and yang is the primordial Supreme Ultimate, wherein true emptiness and wondrous being both reside. The Supreme Ultimate is the source of heaven, earth, and all things; expanding its emptiness, one may advance to the Ultimateless. Though heaven and earth may perish, this remains transcendent and independent beyond the kalpas. Is it not fitting that it is called "eternally possessed"?

Supreme harmony is the primordial *qi*. The *Yijing* says: "Preserve and unite supreme harmony, and each rectifies its nature and destiny." That is, by safeguarding and harmonizing the primordial *qi* of supreme harmony, one naturally attains the rectification of nature and destiny. The *qi* of Qian yang is clear, light, and mild, hence it is called "supreme harmony." After attaining the elixir, the entire body becomes pure yang; the *qi* of supreme harmony flows from within to without, filling the entire body and overflowing beyond the pores and fine apertures. Thus, there appears the phenomenon of golden light enveloping the body, as the *Wuzhen Pian* says: "Lately, golden light manifests throughout the body; I do not speak of this principle to others." Only by obtaining the *qi* of supreme harmony do the sinews, bones, blood, and fluids shed their turbid yin. The white bones turn azure, the azure sinews turn crimson, and the red blood transforms into white marrow—this is the proof of yin cold returning to yang firmness, as the *Huangting Jing* says: "Bones azure, sinews crimson, marrow like frost." These two lines express the meaning that when the yang elixir enters the mouth, yin evil naturally disperses.

Supreme harmony is also what Mencius called the "flood-like *qi*." Attaining the elixir brings numinosity; failing to attain it brings ruin. The elixir within the body is neither white nor azure. The preceding line spoke of "once attained, eternally possessed"; this line speaks of the possibility of attainment or non-attainment, teaching the importance of careful attention to the firing process. For the formation of the elixir involves the firing process of "sealing and securing" and the work of "warm nurturing." If one does not guard against danger and consider risk, there is the peril of loss and leakage. In the past, Patriarch Lü failed three times to return the elixir; only after reading Cui Xiyi’s *Ruyao Jing* did he understand the subtle and wondrous function of the firing process and thus achieve transcendence. Patriarch Bai was careless in returning the elixir, resulting in the "midnight wind and thunder" loss. At that time, Zhang Ziyang was at Tiantai and sent him the *Jindan Sibai Zi*, enabling him to refine it again and succeed. Thus, though the elixir may have formed, errors in the firing process can lead to minor leakage or major calamity, even the ruin of one’s life. The alchemical texts warn: "The treasure of life should not be lightly toyed with." Yet once attained, the mortal bones can be exchanged, and numinosity is instantly achieved, as Chen Nianzu said: "In a moment’s effort, one eternally enjoys boundless ease."

Once attained, "the elixir within the body is neither white nor azure." White pertains to metal, and azure pertains to wood. The elixir arises from the intermingling of metal and wood, the union of the five phases, four images, three families, and two modes. It is formless and colorless, soundless and odorless, and cannot be named by color. This line likely cautions learners against mistaking it for a tangible object, hence it directly states that it cannot be sought through form or appearance—this is the meaning of the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*: "Those who seek me through form or sound walk the wrong path and cannot see the Tathāgata." Recite and uphold it ten thousand times, and the wondrous principle will naturally become clear.

The closing couplet speaks of the profound principles and wondrous words of this *Sūtra*, which must be savored with care to grasp its meaning beyond the surface. Should one read hastily, its truths remain obscure—hence the analogy of "reciting and upholding it ten thousand times, whereupon the principle becomes clear of itself." The primordial spirit of humanity is inherently luminous and bright, yet veiled by worldly desires, losing its true awakening. If one focuses the mind single-pointedly, reflects deeply, and cultivates with utmost sincerity, resonance with the truth arises naturally. All Buddhist and Daoist scriptures that teach recitation and upholding share this intent. Yet the world fails to perceive this, mistaking the *Sūtra* itself for the Dao—how laughable indeed!

This chapter concludes the entire *Sūtra*, expounding in detail the principles of attaining the elixir, its meaning most lucid. Though this *Sūtra* comprises but three hundred characters, it encompasses without omission the workings of Daoist practice and the firing times, surpassing even the *Yinfu* and *Qingjing* scriptures in clarity. Truly, it is the "supreme seal of the heart-mind."

In its four chapters, it first speaks of medicinal substances and the dharma’s measure, then of the workings of practice and firing times, next of the wondrous functions of the three grades, and finally of the three natures returning to unity. The mysteries of attaining the elixir and exiting the spirit are laid bare in full, with no hidden meanings. Should one reflect deeply and read it thoroughly, the path of cultivation will present no difficulty.

**Twelfth Lecture: Heaven’s Theft, Human Theft, Vital Mechanisms, and Lethal Mechanisms**
The Dao resides in natural stillness—only those who are tranquil attain it.

Examining the *Yellow Emperor’s Classic of the Hidden Talisman* (*Yinfu Jing*), we find that earlier commentaries include those by the Grand Duke Jiang and five others, such as Zhang Liang; later, Li Quan and Zhang Guo provided annotations; still later, Lu Qianxu, Li Hanxu, and Liu Wuyuan offered their interpretations; and more recently, Yang Renshan has contributed his own. Each possesses unique insights. As for the Confucian commentaries by Wang Bi, Guo Xiang, and others, they fall far short of the mark.

This scripture encompasses a vast wealth of principles, serving as the foundational source for self-cultivation, family harmony, state governance, and military strategy. The arts of *Fengjiao* (wind divination) and *Qimen* (strange gates) likewise draw from its teachings. For all things arise from *mechanisms* (*ji*), and fortune, misfortune, regret, and shame all emerge from movement. The *Hidden Talisman* expounds the mechanisms of generation and destruction through inversion and reversal—its profundity is extreme.

Within the *Daoist Canon*, there are also the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman’s Celestial Mechanisms* (*Yinfu Tianji Jing*) and the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman’s Divination and Concealment* (*Yinfu Dunjia Jing*), which are referred to as the "outer chapters" of the *Hidden Talisman*. Upon examining their content and meaning, they appear not to be ancient works but may have been forged during the Song dynasty. Here, we shall directly expound the commonly circulated version of the *Hidden Talisman’s Inner Chapters*.

Now, we lecture on the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman*. What this scripture emphasizes lies in the single word *mechanism* (*ji*). In our cultivation of the Dao, the gathering of medicinal substances and the attainment of the elixir depend entirely on *firing times* (*huohou*)—entirely on the adept use of timing. Thus, *mechanism* is what must be most carefully examined.

All things and affairs in the cosmos arise from *mechanism*, and the path to sagehood or immortality particularly demands the urgent mastery of its workings. Why does it not speak of *yang fire* but instead of the *hidden talisman*? The Dao is the Dao of Heaven. *Yin* means hidden, and *fu* means alignment—hidden alignment with the Dao of Heaven. The Dao of Heaven is formless, neither seen nor heard, yet the Dao of the cosmos aligns perfectly with it. Observing the ceaseless transformations of great creation reveals the Dao of Heaven. Those who cultivate the Dao and seek it here will attain the Dao of Heaven.

In human life, there is birth and death, formation and decay. The Dao of Heaven has the *Peeling Away* of winter, which gives rise to the *Return* of spring. Without *Peeling Away*, there can be no *Return*—only with *yin* does *yang* emerge. Though the verdant pine and cypress do not wither in winter, they still sprout new leaves in spring, for they too wax and wane with the *mechanisms of qi*. The so-called *hidden talisman* is the alignment of *yin* with *yang*. The Dao of form aligns with the formless Dao. By observing the manifest, one may know the hidden; grasping one, one naturally returns to the three.

Here, we first provide a line-by-line explication of the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman*:

**"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven—this is perfection."**
These three lines serve as the guiding principles of the entire scripture and clarify the meaning of the *hidden talisman*. Heaven is *yang*; Earth is *yin*. The Dao of Heaven initiates but is invisible, while the Dao of Earth nurtures and is visible. *Qian* (Heaven) governs the Dao of Heaven and is strong, while *Kun* (Earth) compliantly bears Heaven and sustains all things. Cosmic transformation originates from Heaven but is manifested on Earth. The Dao of Earth aligns with the Dao of Heaven as if matching tally tokens—hence the term *hidden talisman*.

Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed and the myriad things are born. The alternation of cold and heat has never deviated from its order since antiquity—this is *grasping the movements of Heaven*. *Movements* refer to the actions of the Dao of Heaven. The Dao of Heaven, though formless, governs great transformation, and the myriad things ceaselessly generate, forming the world of form. Though the Dao of Heaven is invisible, its movements can be grasped and observed to understand that the Dao of Heaven is the principle of *yin-yang* interaction, by which one may trace the origin of the Supreme Ultimate. This is what is meant by *"The Dao is the alternation of one yin and one yang."*

*Yang* is formless, while *yin* has form. The formed arises from the formless; the formless governs, while the formed moves—yet all remains within the transformative nurturing of the single principle and *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate. By observing the principles of waxing and waning in all things, one may know that the root of the Dao is emptiness, which manifests as wondrous existence. From the One, the spirit emerges; nothing remains untransformed. All things decay, and fallen leaves return to their roots. Tracing beginnings to ends, one may know life through death; reckoning the past, one may know the future. By observing images, one may awaken to the Dao. The One disperses into the myriad, yet the myriad ultimately return to the One. By inferring creation from transformation and exhausting the Dao through its movements, the principles of Heaven and humanity are one—hence *"this is perfection."*

This aligns with *"exhausting principle and fulfilling nature,"* *"investigating things to extend knowledge,"* and *"the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s fulfillment of human nature to partake in the meaning of Heaven and Earth."* Li’s commentary, which sees these two lines as encompassing *Qian* and *Kun*, is correct.

*"Observe the Dao of Heaven"* refers to *Qian*, to Heaven. *"Grasp the movements of Heaven"* refers to *Kun*, to Earth. The cosmos’s generation and destruction occur on Earth, and the waxing and waning of the myriad things all emerge from within Earth. The Dao of Heaven is unknowable, but the Dao of Earth is knowable. Earth is rooted in Heaven and enacts its transformative work. The *Qian* element initiates—*initiation* refers to the *Great Beginning*. Before the Five Phases, there are the *Great Simplicity*, *Great Prime*, *Great Inception*, *Great Beginning*, and *Supreme Ultimate*. The *Great Beginning* has a root but cannot be seen. The *Qian* element’s initiation is the transformative work of *Qian* Heaven—this is the pure *yang* metal *qi*, from which all things originate. *Origination* is formless. The *Kun* element nurtures—this is the transformative work of *Kun* Earth, the *qi* of *Kun*’s element, from which all things are born. *Birth* is formed.

The *Qian* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* states: *"Qian: origin, prosperity, benefit, perseverance."* *Origin* is the chief of virtues; *prosperity* is the convergence of excellence; *benefit* is the harmony of righteousness; *perseverance* is the backbone of affairs. These are the four virtues of the *Qian* element.

Its virtue is vast yet invisible; only when the *Kun* element submits in compliance does it manifest in all things. Thus, *"to observe the Dao of Heaven"* lies in *"grasping the workings of Heaven"*—through the *Kun* element one knows the *Qian* element. One *Qian*, one *Kun*: this is one *yang*, one *yin*. *Yang* is great, *yin* is small; the small departs, the great arrives. By measuring the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* in the earthly Dao, one fathoms the soundless, scentless heavenly Dao—thus, nothing of the heavenly Dao remains concealed. These two phrases serve as the guiding principles of the entire classic. The following text then explains the mechanism of mutual generation and restraint, the subtlety of origination and birth, each discussed in turn.

Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them prosper. This continues the above, elucidating the marvel of creation’s differentiation and the unity of Heaven and humanity. *Tai Gong* and *Zhang Guo* annotate the five thieves as the opportunities of time and things (interpreting them as *life*, *things*, *time*, *achievement*, and *spirit*); *Yang Renshan* annotates them as *form*, *sound*, *scent*, *taste*, and *touch*—neither interpretation is apt. The five thieves are the *qi* of the Five Phases, also the *yin* of the Five Aggregates. As seen in the later phrase *"fire is born of wood"* and *"the human heart is a mechanism,"* this is evident. I therefore explicate them in two layers.

From the perspective of *qi* transformation, the five thieves are the Five Phases: *metal*, *wood*, *water*, *fire*, and *earth*. From the perspective of mind and nature, the five thieves are the Five Aggregates: *form*, *sensation*, *perception*, *volition*, and *consciousness*. The Five Phases steal Heaven’s *qi*; the Five Aggregates steal Heaven’s nature.

Why is this so? At the inception of creation, emptiness held nothing—this is called *Wuji*. Then arose *Taiji*: a singular, undifferentiated *qi*, true emptiness unobstructed by wondrous existence, wondrous existence unobstructed by true emptiness. Without names for *yin-yang* or the Five Phases, without signs of arising or ceasing, growth or decline. Further progression brought movement and stillness, dividing *yin* and *yang*. Their interplay formed the four trigrams, joined with the central void to become the Five Phases—all transformations of a single principle-*qi* within *Taiji*.

Yet when one divides into five, there is fullness and depletion; when five unite as one, they do not perish. *Taiji* is the master of cosmic creation: mountains and rivers, flying and burrowing creatures, womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—those with thought, without thought, neither with nor without thought—all arise from *Taiji*’s principle-*qi*. In humans, at the moment of conception, there is but a single formless principle-*qi*. Upon forming the embryo, this *qi* generates the Five Phases. The One is emptiness; from emptiness comes fullness, becoming the physical form endowed with the Five Phases. Once the Five Phases are complete, arising and ceasing begin—thus, the five of *birth*, *aging*, *sickness*, *suffering*, and *death* all arrive in profusion.

For only emptiness in the world does not decay. Since fullness arises from emptiness, *qi* accumulates into form, and the Five Phases take shape, decay becomes inevitable—this can be stated with certainty.

Humans are a microcosm of Heaven and Earth. At the moment of receiving *qi*, there is but a single *qi*, chaotic and undifferentiated, neither knowing nor recognizing. Heaven endows it as *nature*; humans receive it as *destiny*. Heavenly nature is originally empty, neither arising nor ceasing. From *prior Heaven* it transforms into *posterior Heaven*, and the single *qi* generates the Five Phases. Thus, nature turns into emotion; the *qi* of the Five Phases transforms into *essence*, *spirit*, *hun*, *po*, and *intent*—these five correspond internally and externally with the physical form, perishing when the form perishes. Yet there are cases where the form has not perished, but these five have already vanished. These five steal one’s heavenly destiny, preventing what is received from Heaven from fully returning to Heaven. When the form perishes, these five perish as well, and may even harm the form. If these are not thieves, then what are? These are the five thieves of the body—external thieves.

As for the Five Aggregates—*form*, *sensation*, *perception*, *volition*, and *consciousness*—they are the five thieves of the *posterior Heaven* nature. *Form* steals one’s physical appearance, entering through the eyes and residing in the heart, so that objects arise in the heart. *Sensation* is reception, felt in the heart and stored there. *Perception* is thought, the two minds of past and future. *Volition* is action, responding to things. Only with *form* and *sensation* does *perception* arise; stillness of body and thought lead to movement and action—this is their natural order. *Consciousness* is the *shen* of awareness, *"fluctuating to and fro, companions to your thoughts"* (as in the *Xian* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*), ceaselessly galloping.

Heavenly nature is stolen by these five, giving rise to good and evil, life and death. When emptiness held nothing and preserved the celestial truth, there was no talk of arising or ceasing, and the luminous essence remained unlost. Now, ravaged by these five, one cannot fulfill their heavenly years, suffering illness, premature death, and the dulling of their luminous subtlety, becoming a heart of *yin* turbidity and dissipation. Heavenly nature is originally empty, yet the Five Aggregates solidify it; heavenly nature is originally luminous, yet the Five Aggregates obscure it. Over time, heavenly nature seems lost, and the *shen* of awareness takes control.

Immersed in the Five Aggregates, our original face is utterly obliterated. We commit all manner of evil deeds, planting calamitous roots for a thousand generations. The evil karma of beings persists through eons, emerging and submerging in the Six Paths, unable to extricate themselves for ten thousand kalpas. Only *karma* in the world is beyond comprehension. Tracing the root of calamity, it lies in the Five Aggregates obscuring our heavenly nature, stealing our primordial *shen*, transforming the pure, luminous, and perfect heart into one of cunning and dissipation. Thus, we sink to such depths—how lamentable!

If these are not thieves, then who else could be? These are the five thieves of the heart—thieves that dwell within. Thus, from the perspective of *qi*-transformation, the five thieves are the Five Phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. From the perspective of spirit-transformation (that is, the transformations of the heart-mind), the five thieves are the Five Aggregates: form, sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness.

The five thieves, whether internal or external, plunder body and mind. If we could but recognize them as thieves and cast them out, we would escape their poison and preserve our body and mind—an achievement no less than that of the sages. Yet ordinary people often mistake thieves for their own kin, regarding the five thieves as benefactors who gave them life, cherishing and embracing them, for they fail to see them as thieves.

If one can truly perceive these five thieves, allowing body and mind to return to the Great Void, employing the reverse course of creation to subdue them—Water overcoming Fire, Fire overcoming Earth, Earth overcoming Wood, Wood overcoming Metal, each in turn restraining the next, culminating in emptiness—preventing them from following the natural sequence of creation (Wood generating Fire, Fire generating Metal, Metal generating Water, Water generating Earth) and thus falling into the cycle of birth and death, then transforming delusion into constancy and refining thoughts into sageliness, attaining longevity and transcendence as an immortal, would be no difficult matter. Hence it is said, *"To see them is to flourish."*

To see is to delve into the source of yin and yang, to comprehend the principle of True Emptiness, to recognize the original face before father and mother were born, and thus to preserve the heavenly-endowed nature and life. One can then embrace and magnify them. Yet only sages—and those who later study to become sages—can achieve this.

The five thieves reside within humans but operate throughout Heaven. Where, then, do the five thieves ultimately lie? The answer is: *"The five thieves are in the heart, yet their operations extend to Heaven."*

The five of form, sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness are the Five Aggregates, born originally from emptiness. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are the Five *qi*, transformations of the primordial *qi*. When receiving life from Heaven, one is originally round and luminous, pure and unadorned, free from the slightest trace of karmic dust or worldly fruit. Yet as *qi* takes form and the embryo matures with full *qi*, the primordial *qi* divides into the Five *qi*, the spirit-chamber harbors the intermediate *yin*, the body embodies the Five Phases, and the heart contains the Five Aggregates.

Once the Five Phases exist, birth and death arise; once the Five Aggregates exist, rebirth begins. This is the primordial work of creation, concealed within body and mind, inescapable. If one wishes to remove them, the Way lies in *"seeing."* Recognizing them as thieves and preserving the original face of emptiness, one engages in the path of restraint and is no longer afflicted by them.

The five thieves within body and mind operate according to the natural principles of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning: One gives rise to two, two to three, three to five—all rooted in the natural order, ordained by Heaven, shared by all without distinction between sage and commoner. Only by overcoming them does one become a sage.

This passage clarifies that the five thieves originate from Heaven, not from man. The following text will expound on the efficacy of restraining the five thieves, proceeding in an orderly and unconfused manner.

*"The cosmos is in the hand; the myriad transformations arise from the body."*

Above and below, the four directions are called *"space"* (宇); past and future, ancient and modern, are called *"time"* (宙). The cosmos is in my hand, and the myriad transformations arise from my body—only those who perceive the five thieves can achieve this. Why? Because one who recognizes these five as thieves must also understand the principles of creation: the cosmos and its myriad transformations all arise from the primordial *qi*. Knowing this, one can return to the root and revert to the source, ultimately merging into emptiness, naturally becoming a great person of primordial spirit and creation, with the cosmos and its myriad transformations at one’s command.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"The great person harmonizes their virtue with Heaven and Earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, and their auspices and omens with ghosts and spirits. They precede Heaven, yet Heaven does not oppose them; they follow Heaven, yet accord with its timing."* (See *Xici* in the *Book of Changes*.) The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully realize one’s nature. Fully realizing one’s nature, one can fully realize the nature of others. Fully realizing the nature of others, one can fully realize the nature of things. Fully realizing the nature of things, one can assist in Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturing. Assisting in Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturing, one can form a trinity with Heaven and Earth."*

This is the annotation for *"the cosmos is in the hand; the myriad transformations arise from the body."* Indeed, our body and mind originally form a Supreme Ultimate, identical to that of Heaven and Earth. Through reverse cultivation and return, pushing to the utmost, one transcends the ordinary and enters sageliness, standing alongside Heaven and Earth to form the Three Powers. Grasping yin and yang, silently participating in the great transformation, the sage’s virtue is equal in measure to Heaven and Earth, beyond all conception.

Moreover, the hand is the gate of total control, the place of mastery. Yan Hui, upon gaining one good quality, *"clasped it to his breast with reverence"* (both from the *Doctrine of the Mean*). Confucius *"governed the world as if viewing it in his palm."* In the hexagrams, this corresponds to *Gen* (艮), which symbolizes restraining anger and suppressing desire. The youngest son represents the hand, embodying the dynamic of yang extending and yin yielding. Zengzi said: *"When ten hands point at one, how severe it is!"* (See the *Doctrine of the Mean*.) The alchemical texts say: *"The two hands split open the primordial chaos."* There is also the saying: *"The left hand subdues the dragon; the right hand tames the tiger."*

The hand, in relation to body and mind, is linked to both movement and stillness. The arising of true yang first responds in the hand. Thus, in the *Xian* (咸) hexagram, the first six begins with self-restraint and resonance. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight stir within, and the hands dance and point, trembling in response.

The heart of the infant is ever one, without duality; the hands of the infant, too, are ever clenched. *Laozi* says: *"The infant’s bones are soft, its sinews supple, yet its grip is firm."* *Mencius* says: *"The great man is one who does not lose the heart of the infant."* (*Li Lou II*) While the fetus lies in the womb, its two hands grasp at the gate of creation; when it first stirs, the hands part, and soon it is born. If one can guard the unperturbed heart and hold fast with firmness, one may progress from sincerity to clarity, from clarity to duration, and from duration to manifestation. The Buddha asks: *"The four directions—east, south, west, north—above, below, and the four intermediate quarters, together with the empty space between: can these be conceived? No."* Between the two hands, too, lies emptiness, vast and boundless. From ancient times to the present, all life unfolds within this emptiness; and every movement of the hands, whether flexing or extending, likewise operates within it. *"The great Dao is clearly before the eyes"*—and what is before the eyes is the inconceivable emptiness. If one can empty the heart and fill its capacity, merging with the great void, then the transformative nurturing of heaven and earth becomes one’s own nurturing; the space between the hands encompasses the vastness of heaven and earth. Thus it is said: *"The cosmos lies within the hands."* It is also called the *"gate of total holding,"* or *"guarding the center and embracing the One,"* or *"pointing to the palm."*

As the human body is a microcosm of heaven and earth, heaven has the sun and moon, while man has the ears and eyes; earth has water and fire, while man has spirit and qi. Heaven and earth bring forth creation through the alternation of cold and heat, their mechanism residing in the solstices of winter and summer; the human body, too, undergoes the waxing and waning of yin and yang, giving rise to life and death, conception and nurturing, its mechanism lying between the hexagrams *Fu* (復) and *Gou* (姤). Examined in detail, the seventy-two seasonal markers, the twenty-four qi, the cycles of day and night, darkness and dawn, and the pivotal moments of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—all these are fully present within the human body. The marvel of resonance and the principle of mutual influence are supremely empty yet supremely numinous. Thus, though the myriad transformations occur within heaven and earth, they are no less fully contained within the human body. *Mencius* says: *"All things are complete within me"*—how fitting!

The five phases overcome the one qi to give rise to the ten thousand differences. The agent of this process is none other than the creative heavens, yet the human heart responds to it, and the body and hands sense its mechanism, so that movement and stillness are both fitting. How wondrous! Heavenly nature belongs to man; the human heart is its mechanism. Man receives the nature of heaven as his own nature, and in the beginning, this is but a single point of principle-qi. Endowed with this principle-qi, one is born human, and this nature resides within the human heart. Later, it must transform into emotion, arising in response to circumstances—this is the human heart. What heaven bestows is called *nature*; what arises in response to circumstances is called *heart*. Heavenly nature in motion becomes the primordial spirit; the human heart in motion becomes the discriminating spirit. Heavenly nature is empty and without substance. We receive the principle-qi and are born, and within this emptiness lies wondrous existence, yet this wondrous existence remains within emptiness. Empty yet not empty, not empty yet truly identical to emptiness—this is what distinguishes man from beasts. *Mencius* says: *"That by which man differs from the beasts is but slight."* (*Li Lou II*) It is because he possesses heavenly nature within.

Here arises a question: the Buddhist teaching of *"whether a dog has Buddha-nature."* Some say it both has and does not have. Though a dog is a beast, it may cultivate the Dao and attain fruition, so it may be said to have Buddha-nature. Yet from the moment of receiving qi, man and beast differ greatly. Man is the spirit of the myriad things, and the principle-qi he receives is pure, complete, and centered; as for beasts, they lack Buddha-nature and are impure, and thus cannot be said to possess heavenly nature. Consider the tiger and the wolf: fierce and devouring, born with a vicious nature, dull and unenlightened—their lack of Buddha-nature is self-evident.

Let us examine this principle closely. The qi of *Qian*’s origin initiates the myriad things, forming images in heaven; the qi of *Kun*’s origin gives birth to the myriad things, forming shapes on earth. All things in the cosmos with form and appearance arise from this. Yet those born from wombs and eggs first perceive and then respond with qi; those born from moisture or sprouting plants first move with qi and then respond to perception. The former receive qi through self-perception, while the latter are transformed and born through qi’s influence.

Man, the spirit of the myriad things, receives qi in the same way as womb-born creatures, except that at the very moment of perception, he first obtains the true emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate. When male and female unite in essence, reaching the height of joy, all is forgotten, and the heart-body becomes empty and luminous, just like the primordial Supreme Ultimate (or Non-Ultimate). Then, the perfectly round, radiant true emptiness of wondrous existence arises in response to perception, like ⊙. When it later combines with the postnatal spirit and qi of male and female, it separates into *Qian*’s origin and *Kun*’s origin, establishing the root of nature and life. In an instant, the Non-Ultimate, Supreme Ultimate, Two Modes, Four Images, and Five Phases are all fully present—thus it is said that man alone receives the entirety of creation. This true emptiness of the primordial Supreme Ultimate is the heavenly nature bestowed by heaven, and it is also Buddha-nature. Bodhidharma said: *"Each person possesses Buddha-nature"* and *"Directly point to the human heart, see one’s nature, and attain Buddhahood."* The Confucians speak of *"heavenly nature’s empty numinosity,"* and the Daoists of *"the primordial nature’s original emptiness and stillness"*—all refer to this. As for beasts, they merely respond to the qi-mechanism without numinous perception. At the moment of conception, they form only this ⊙, truly lacking what can be called *"heavenly nature."*

This is why both Buddhist and Daoist traditions speak of *"the rarity of obtaining a human body."* The human heart responds to circumstances, manifesting as either good or evil. Mencius taught *"the goodness of human nature,"* while Xunzi argued *"the evil of human nature"*—yet both masters urged emulation of Yao and Shun. Xunzi’s *"evil nature"* refers to the human heart, the acquired nature of food and desire; Mencius’s *"good nature"* speaks of heavenly nature, the primordial essence. Human natures differ due to habitual conditioning: dyed blue, they become blue; dyed yellow, they become yellow—this is the acquired nature of qi and material form, the nature of food and desire.

When the human heart arises, its manifestations vary with timing and opportunity. The extinction of spirit-consciousness and the presence of primordial spirit depend on the moment; the return from spirit-consciousness to primordial spirit also hinges on the moment. The deluded may descend into bestiality in an instant, while the return from delusion to truth likewise occurs in an instant. Following the five thieves leads to mutual generation, while reversing them leads to mutual conquest. Following the sequence, wood generates fire, and from one arises ten thousand, forming the world; reversing it, water conquers fire, and from ten thousand returns to one, merging into the Great Void. For humanity, following the sequence gives rise to mortals, while reversing it produces immortals.

The human faculties of ears, eyes, mouth, and nose—when followed—lead to delusion in the six dusts, spawning every evil, even to the point of patricide and regicide. Thus, some wander in samsara, trapped in the six realms of rebirth, enduring kalpas of suffering without return. But if one reverses the flow, restraining the self and returning to propriety, refining the false to cultivate the true—like the ear’s innate ability to hear, yet making it hear the soundless; the eye’s innate ability to see, yet making it see the formless—extending this to the tongue, heart, and thoughts, all follow the same principle. From delusion to awakening, one may become a Buddha or an immortal, attaining the same indestructibility as the Great Void.

Though all share the same heart and the same principle, the gap between sage and villain may be vast, yet both originate from the same moment. Those who skillfully employ this moment harmonize with heaven and earth, return to the root and restore life, merging the human heart into heavenly nature—thus fulfilling the Dao of humanity. Yet only those who perceive the five thieves can achieve this. The Dao of heaven is established to stabilize humanity. The Dao is heavenly nature; to preserve it, one must establish the Dao of heaven. The Dao of heaven lies in the interplay of yin and yang. By grounding the Dao of heaven in this yin-yang dynamic, the human heart is stabilized.

This depends on transforming spirit-consciousness into primordial spirit. Spirit-consciousness is yin; primordial spirit is yang. Eliminating yin to preserve yang means shedding the human heart to return to heavenly nature. Once heavenly nature is established, the human heart naturally stabilizes. Otherwise, one cannot sustain the birthless primordial spirit to attain the principle of non-arising, and body and mind will still fall into the path of arising and ceasing. Chasing the unnatural spirit-consciousness harms one’s original heavenly nature; when spirit-consciousness runs rampant, the original nature scatters into the realm of nothingness.

Whether one becomes immortal or mortal, human or beast, the moment is subtle—one must discern it early and seize the opportunity. This chapter discusses heavenly nature and the human heart, the return from humanity to heaven to become a sage or good, and the descent from heaven to humanity into delusion and evil. Thus, the sage focuses on establishing the Dao of heaven, on the harmonious arising of heaven and humanity, and on perceiving the five thieves. By distinguishing heavenly nature from the human heart and grasping the moment of their harmonious arising, one can advance in cultivation and attain the Dao, becoming a perfected being. These two lines thus serve as the guiding principle for what follows, and must be read together. A detailed explanation follows.

When heaven releases its killing mechanism, stars and constellations withdraw; when earth releases its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when humanity releases its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn. Only when heaven and humanity arise in harmony is the foundation of the myriad transformations secured.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"The Dao of heaven is called yin and yang; the Dao of earth is called yielding and firm; the Dao of humanity is called benevolence and righteousness."* (See *Xici* in the *Yijing*) Understanding the principles of yin-yang and yielding-firm enables one to embody benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence is yang; righteousness is yin. The generative qi of heaven and earth at the beginning of life is humanity’s benevolence; the destructive qi of heaven and earth in completion is humanity’s righteousness. Mencius said: *"The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence; the heart of shame and aversion is the beginning of righteousness."* (See *Mencius*, *Gongsun Chou I*) Humanity’s benevolence and righteousness are heaven’s yin and yang; their waxing and waning lie in the moment of movement and stillness—thus one knows the Dao of yin and yang.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Movement and stillness have constancy, and the firm and yielding find their proper place."* (See *Xici* in the *Yijing*; original reads *"the firm and yielding are determined"*) Only with constancy can they find their proper place. Humanity is one of the three powers, endowed with the qi of heaven and earth, and thus can seize the creative power of heaven and earth. When heaven and earth release their killing mechanism, it is their movement; when humanity releases its killing mechanism, it is the movement of humanity with heaven and earth. Yet within the killing mechanism lies the generative mechanism—hence it is said *"overturn."* Life reverses into death, and death reverses into life, just as yin and yang exhaust their transformations.

Where there is life, there is death, and death resides within life; where there is death, there is life, and life resides within death. One life, one death—this is one movement, one stillness. Yang moves and generates; yin is still and kills. At winter solstice, heaven’s yang revives, a generative mechanism, progressing from one yang to two and three, until six yangs form pure Qian, the extreme of yang. At summer solstice, one yin arises, a killing mechanism, progressing from one yin to two and three, until six yins form pure Kun—thus the cycle begins anew.

At the summer solstice, the mandate resides in the fifth month, precisely when the generative mechanism reaches its zenith—yet the mechanism of killing already lies concealed within it. Thus, the hexagram *Tianfeng Gou* arrives, and one yin arises beneath the five yangs of heaven. From *Gou* comes *Bo*, and when the mandate reaches "Great Snow," yin attains its extreme. Then *Dilei Fu* arrives, and one yang stirs beneath five yins. From *Fu* comes *Guai*—its principle identical to *"exhaustion gives rise to change, change gives rise to return."*

The mechanisms of generation and killing thus interweave and lie concealed within one another. The killing mechanism of heaven and earth resides within the generative mechanism. During mid-spring, when grasses and trees sprout, the climate is mild, and the generative mechanism flourishes—yet the killing mechanism is already present within it. Witness the sudden fall of elm seeds: in the second month, following the opening of the three yangs, when flowers and trees vie in splendor, elm leaves have just unfurled, yet their seeds swiftly scatter—is this not proof of generation and killing proceeding in tandem? Elm seeds are the seeds of the elm tree, and generally, seeds form only after flowers have bloomed to their fullest, their calyces fallen. Yet here, at the time of leafing, the seeds have already ripened and fallen—this is killing within generation.

During mid-autumn, before the descent of frost, when the killing mechanism is at its height—trees shed their yellowed leaves, and all things wither—yet the generative mechanism is concealed within it. At this time, shepherd’s purse and wheat suddenly sprout—this is generation within killing. Thus do the generative and killing mechanisms of heaven and earth mutually conceal one another. Human fortune and misfortune follow the same transformative pattern as heaven and earth, revolving and intertwining like a ring. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must take heed of this.

To seek long life, first seek non-life. If one clings to the notion of craving life, death will surely follow without reprieve. For the mechanism of human life and death admits no gap—at the moment when one yang revives, if one follows the path of reverse cultivation, empties the heart to gather and refine, and transmutes essence into qi, one may preserve one’s celestial authenticity. If one follows the path of sequential progression, this is the union of essence to generate human life, where desire burns and harms the body, hastening death.

This is the mechanism of one generation and one killing. When the acquired spirit governs, celestial nature is lost. If one further follows its flame and nurtures it, one may commit all manner of evil deeds. Yet if one restrains the acquired spirit and does not employ it, one may attain purity and non-action, preserve the uncarved celestial principle, expand one’s capacity, and transform it greatly—thus may one achieve perfection of form and spirit, uniting with the Dao in truth.

The mechanism of generation and killing is one, yet its application differs. As the *Canon* states: *"Within kindness lies harm; within harm, kindness arises."* Kindness resides within harm, and harm within kindness. The human body labors for clothing and food, and through labor obtains life—yet within this labor lie birth, aging, sickness, and death: this is kindness within harm. Those who cultivate the Dao close their eyes and ears, which may seem arduous, yet they extend their years and longevity. Though they suffer in the moment, their future hope is vast: this is harm within kindness.

The mechanism of generation and killing lies solely in inversion. When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, thunder, wind, and rain arise, heaven and earth darken, and the sun, moon, and stars all conceal themselves and vanish. Thus, the appearance of the sun, moon, and stars is heaven’s constancy, while their concealment is its transformation. Even the fixed stars disappear, and the sun and moon suffer eclipse—Confucius recorded these in the *Spring and Autumn Annals* to mark heaven’s killing mechanism.

The fixed stars, by nature enduring and unchanging, are visible at all times; though veiled by the sun’s brilliance in daylight, they may still be seen from high places or through astronomical instruments. The sun and moon shine day and night, constant through the ages. Yet when heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, even the ever-visible stars conceal themselves, and the ever-bright sun and moon wane—thus one knows that heaven cannot have generation without killing. Violent thunder and fierce winds are minor manifestations of the killing mechanism; the concealment of stars and the darkening of day are its major forms.

Li’s annotation of this "unleashing" as the generative mechanism does not accord with the meaning. The *Yinfu Jing* fundamentally expounds the principle of kindness arising within harm and the reversal of generation and killing. When speaking of the killing mechanism, the generative mechanism is already within it—there is no need to directly call it the "generative mechanism."

When earth unleashes its killing mechanism, "dragons and snakes rise from the land"—this is the time of *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects). Before the awakening, dragons and snakes lie hidden in the mountains, in a state of undifferentiated chaos, without knowledge or awareness. At *Jingzhe*, the yang qi stirs, rousing their consciousness to emerge—this is the moment when earth unleashes its killing mechanism, hence the term *Jingzhe*. Yet this "killing mechanism" is spoken of in terms of the Dao of yin and yang. When the killing mechanism stirs, dragons and snakes emerge, transforming hibernation into flight and leaping. In the Dao, this is the killing mechanism, yet for dragons and snakes, it is the generative mechanism.

The concealment of stars in the heavens is the killing mechanism, yet when stars veil their light, they will shine all the brighter afterward—this, too, is not without its generative mechanism. This is what is meant by *"the generative mechanism lying concealed."*

The *Scripture* proceeds from heaven and earth to speak of humanity: *"When humans unleash the killing mechanism, heaven and earth reverse."* These two lines are the crucial key to the entire text. For humans are one of the Three Powers, with heaven as their canopy and earth as their chariot, dwelling between them. Qian’s nature is pure yang, yet it governs the virtue of yin and yang; Kun’s disposition is pure yin, yet it directs the qi of hardness and softness. Humans unite the nature and disposition of Qian and Kun and receive the upright qi of heaven and earth. Thus, the transformations within the human body are the transformations of heaven and earth.

When humans unleash the killing mechanism, it is the moment when heaven’s stars sink and vanish, when earth’s dragons and serpents rise from the land—thus it is called *"heaven and earth reverse."* The mechanism of generation and destruction lies precisely within this *"reversal."* The *Book of Changes* states: *"The noble person works unceasingly all day, for the Way is in reversal."* (See *Xici* commentary on *Qian*.) Only by rectifying the heart and making the will sincere, maintaining purity and constancy, with *"clarity and luminosity embodied"* and *"diligence day and night without remiss,"* can one reverse the mechanism of generation and destruction and advance upon the Dao.

The mechanism of generation and destruction in heaven and earth resembles the solstices: at the winter solstice, destruction reaches its peak and turns toward generation; at the summer solstice, generation reaches its peak and turns toward destruction. This mechanism is revealed in movement and stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement must arise; when movement reaches its extreme, stillness must follow. All things in the world operate through the interplay of movement and stillness—just as humans rise to labor at sunrise and must rest at sunset.

The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—within the body, a yang arises of itself."* This *"arising of the one yang"* is the body’s winter solstice, its sign appearing at the moment of extreme stillness, as when yang stirs after deep sleep. When movement reaches its extreme and turns to stillness, true yang ascends, the first yin arrives to meet it, and cool fluid descends—this is the body’s summer solstice.

The moment when the body’s qi mechanism stirs is precisely when the one yang returns. The generative mechanism is the killing mechanism—it can give life or take it: following it gives human life; reversing it yields immortality. When emotions and desires stir and primordial qi transforms into essence, this is the killing mechanism—birth, aging, illness, and death all arise from this. The yang essence within the human body reaches its fullness on the day when the Yellow Path of five thousand four hundred births is complete, an ancient metaphor called *"sixteen zhu in total."* This is the time of utmost abundance, after which it will never regenerate. Once leakage occurs, it diminishes; when exhausted, death follows. Those who ravage it severely die young. The *Awakening to Reality* says: *"There is only one original source—no trifling profit fills the purse."*

When our killing mechanism stirs, if we reverse it, essence reverts to qi, and through gradual refinement, the foundation of the elixir is laid. The term *"inversion"* in elixir texts refers precisely to this. The *Awakening to Reality* states: *"If you understand the killing mechanism and its reversal, you will see that harm conceals grace."* For human movement and stillness follow the qi mechanism of heaven and earth: yang arises in stillness, which is the winter solstice; yin arises in movement, which is the summer solstice. Extending this logic, all twenty-four qi reside within the body.

The *Classic of Yin Conformity* embodies the formless Dao of heaven. By grasping its mechanism and applying it, one can seize the transformations of heaven and earth and reverse them. Heaven’s yang returns in seven days; in humans, it arises from extreme stillness. This *"reversal"* is the turning of heaven and earth’s handle of generation and destruction, the wielding of the power over yin and yang’s waxing and waning. By uniting the human with heaven and reversing its mechanism, one can *"observe the Way of heaven"* and *"grasp the workings of heaven."* The mechanism emitted by heaven and humans is the same, and thus the foundation of the transformations of the myriad things is established.

Master Lü said: *"The living do not live; the dead do not die. To kill the living after it is born and to learn death before dying—this is longevity."* At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, when knowledge is entirely extinguished and worldly desires do not arise, how can yang stir? This is the mechanism where heaven and humanity unite in emission. Heaven’s yang qi surges, stirring the qi mechanism—hence it is called the *"winter solstice"* or the *"living midnight hour."*

The Supreme Ultimate that governs creation is originally a body of empty chaos. When the human heart becomes empty, it merges with it in substance. Thus, yang arises from emptiness, and the heart of heaven and the human heart resonate as like attracts like. True yang, borne by the yin heel vessel, surges into the *"Gate of Life"* and stirs. This is what is meant by *"primordial true yang arising from the formless,"* or *"summoning true yang to come forth,"* or *"like a magnet drawing iron, penetrating barriers without obstruction"*—all refer to this single event.

When the heart is empty, I become the emptiness of the Supreme Ultimate and naturally resonate with the Supreme Ultimate of the void. When the body is still, I embody the pure Kun trigram and naturally draw that one yang to return. Those who cultivate the Dao must first discern the clarity or turbidity of the water’s source to verify whether it is the mechanism where heaven and humanity unite. Only the yang that arises from extreme emptiness and stillness is clear; the slightest intrusion of emotion or thought renders it turbid, no longer a union of heaven and humanity.

Thus, when we first begin our practice, we must seek deep sleep in stillness. At this time, unaware and unknowing, heaven and earth unite in harmony, sun and moon conjoin, and chaos coalesces into the vision of the Supreme Ultimate. Then, a single point of principle-qi naturally emerges from the void, initiating creation. By employing this mechanism in stillness, gathering, sealing, and securing it, the foundation of all transformations is established.

Zhang Sanfeng said: *"If the human heart unites with the heart of heaven, the inversion of yin and yang takes but a moment."* Shaozi said: *"Within that fleeting radiance, there is no time for words."* Chen Nigan said: *"A mere instant’s effort yields endless ease and joy."* Such is the truth.

When heaven and humanity unite in activation, for ordinary people this is a mechanism of destruction, but for the Dao cultivator it becomes a mechanism of generation—this is the "inversion," the "reversal." The mechanism of generation and destruction lies in a single moment, so to seize it, one must first yield to it. Banishing all thoughts of the heart-mind, one seeks the state of emptiness and stillness—this is what is meant by *"To seek long life, first one must embrace no-life."*

Moreover, the Dao of heaven and earth is the Dao of humanity; yin and yang are none other than benevolence and righteousness, and the vast and unyielding qi is the principle-qi, born of *"accumulated righteousness."* Righteousness is metal, stillness, silence—when stillness reaches its utmost, it becomes trustworthiness. Benevolence is wood, movement, life—life and movement are the arising of benevolence. Righteousness governs solemn stillness; only after accumulating much metal can one resonate with the ceaselessly generating benevolence. The principle of *"heaven and humanity uniting in activation"* is thus in accord with the principle of human life.

When man and woman unite, their passions reach their peak and dissolve into emptiness, their spirits merging into one. Thereupon, they can resonate with the true yang descending from the void to form an embryo—this is the transformative mechanism of one yin and one yang. As for the resonance within the individual body, one employs the yin and yang within to summon the principle-qi from the void. When body and heart-mind become still, they form the Supreme Ultimate, returning to the original face before the parents’ birth. The prenatal true yang then naturally responds and arrives—what is called *nature* in heaven and *destiny* in humanity.

When heaven and humanity unite in activation, this is the moment when the original true emptiness of one’s nature merges with the nature of heaven, and one beholds one’s true nature. For *"heaven and humanity uniting in activation"* is the full realization of humanity in harmony with heaven. Yet nature may be skillful or clumsy, and can be concealed. The depravities of the nine orifices lie in the three essentials, which can be moved or stilled.

Fire arises from wood, and when calamity erupts, it must be subdued. Treachery arises in the state, and when the time comes, it must collapse. One who knows this and cultivates accordingly is called a sage.

*"Nature may be skillful or clumsy, and can be concealed"*—the nature endowed by heaven is the emptiness of the void, the undifferentiated body of the primordial spirit, appearing clumsy yet truly skillful, neither arising nor ceasing. The acquired nature of qi and material form, received from parents and shaped by the karmic roots of past lives’ food and desire, is the consciousness-spirit, appearing skillful yet truly clumsy. The former nature shares the same body as the great void and can lead to sagehood or immortality, thus appearing clumsy yet truly skillful. The consciousness-spirit is the seed of hell and the ancestor of all evils, thus appearing skillful yet truly clumsy. Ordinary people, governed by the consciousness-spirit, in truth turn skillfulness into clumsiness.

Yet the consciousness-spirit and the primordial spirit, though they alternate between skill and clumsiness, mutually conceal and restrain one another. When the consciousness-spirit is extinguished, the primordial spirit revives; when the primordial spirit recedes, the consciousness-spirit runs rampant. The Dao cultivator subdues the consciousness-spirit, returning it to emptiness—this is concealing skill within clumsiness. Though the primordial spirit may seem undifferentiated, it contains vast luminosity. Thus, the clumsy can be made skillful, and even the acquired nature of qi and material form can be transformed and returned to truth—this is why *"concealment"* is essential.

The primordial spirit is yang; the consciousness-spirit is yin. The two mutually conceal and restrain one another, naturally forming the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate. Thus, at the outset of practice, the *"hidden dragon does not act"*—one conceals and subdues the heart-mind and nature, remaining utterly still. As the *Canticle* says: *"The true person dwells deep in the abyss, floating and roaming within the compass."* Guarding one’s purity, body and heart-mind in non-action, the consciousness-spirit is entirely concealed within the hollow emptiness. Within, one forms a body of pure clarity; without, one assumes the form of pure Kun.

*Laozi* said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return."* He also spoke of *"returning to the root,"* *"purity and stillness,"* and *"restoring the root of destiny"*—all referring to the principle of concealment. The *Kun* hexagram, circulating through the six voids, is called *"returning to concealment."* The alchemical texts speak of *"the medicine arising in the Kun direction"* and the saying *"facing the southwest"*—all expressing this same meaning.

Ordinary people cannot conceal because of the *"depravities of the nine orifices."* The *"nine orifices"* are the ears, eyes, nose (two orifices), mouth, external genitals, and anus. Some also count the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, navel, external genitals, anus, heart, and crown as the nine orifices. All nine are gateways for depravity: the eyes see and are deluded by the five colors, the ears hear and are deluded by the five sounds, the mouth craves flavors and is deluded by the five tastes, the nose smells and is deluded by the five qi, while the body is deluded by desires, the heart-mind by emotions and attachments—all are depravities. With these nine depravities, essence, qi, and spirit leak outward, and the human heart-mind becomes scattered, unable to conceal.

If one can close them, one becomes utterly still and unmoving. The consciousness-spirit relies on the nine orifices as its gateways. All human movement, action, thought, contemplation, sensation, and perception belong to the consciousness-spirit. The consciousness-spirit is made perceptive through the nine orifices, hence the term *"depravities of the nine orifices."* Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, when expressed in moderation, are harmony; when immoderate, they are depravities.

Confucius said: *"Let your thoughts be without depravity"* (see *Analects* 2.2) and *"The noble person has nine contemplations"* (*Analects* 16.11). The ears and eyes cannot think—why then are seeing, hearing, speaking, and bearing all called *"contemplation"*? Because contemplation is governed by the consciousness-spirit. If thoughts are depraved, the nine become depraved; if thoughts are upright, the nine become upright.

The *"three essentials"* are the ears, eyes, and mouth. As the *Canticle* says: *"The ears, eyes, and mouth are the three treasures—close and seal them, do not let them open."*

The union of *dui* does not rely on speech; scarce words accord with the primal chaos. This pertains to the external; as for the internal, it is the three of essence, *qi*, and spirit. Essence flows through the ears, *qi* flows through the mouth, and spirit flows through the eyes—these three interpenetrate. The ears and essence both belong to the *kan* palace; the *qi* of breath enters and exits through the mouth. When *qi* moves, spirit moves—this is the *"three essentials."* If the three essentials are closed and not allowed to flow, then the nature of skill and clumsiness may be concealed; the depravities of the nine orifices may return to the true. What can be moved or stilled are the ears, eyes, and mouth—the three essentials, which are ever in motion and never at rest, yet may be moved or stilled. When in motion, essence, *qi*, and spirit leak outward; when at rest, they are stored within. If one can contain the light of the eyes, congeal the resonance of the ears, regulate the breath of the nose, and seal the *qi* of the tongue, so that what moves becomes still, then the three essentials transform into the *"three treasures."*

For when the three essentials move, the six roots encounter the six dusts, inwardly giving rise to the six consciousnesses and outwardly emitting the seven emotions. Sinking into delusion without return, one falls into the cycle of rebirth. When still, the six consciousnesses return to their origin, the three treasures harmonize, and with courageous diligence, one immediately realizes bodhi. As the *Daodejing* says: *"Of those who follow life, thirteen; of those who follow death, thirteen"*—this is also the principle of *"one transforming into ten thousand, ten thousand returning to one."* The ears, eyes, and mouth are originally for seeing, hearing, eating, and drinking, to nourish this body, and seeing and hearing are especially where intelligence resides. That by which humans are endowed with spirit depends solely on these. Yet the mechanism of life lies here, and the mechanism of death also lies here; skill lies here, and clumsiness also lies here; intelligence lies here, and dullness also lies here. Form, sound, fragrance, flavor, and touch—these are what plunder the heavenly nature of our body and mind. What brings fortune is precisely what brings misfortune, just as fire relates to wood: fire is born from wood, yet when fire burns too fiercely, wood is consumed by it. Thus, what benefits others may turn to harm them, hence the saying: *"Fire is born from wood, yet calamity inevitably strikes."*

Extending this to the state, the principle is the same. If a crafty hero exploits the moment and the ruler trusts and empowers him, nurturing his influence only to ruin the state—such as Wang Mang’s humility and deference to scholars, Dong Zhuo’s merit in suppressing rebels, Xiang Yu’s restoration of Chu leading to its downfall, and Zhu Wen’s defense of Tang leading to its collapse—history records countless such cases. Who can know the mechanism of life and death, fortune and misfortune, and respond to the signs of movement and stillness? Only the sage! The path of cultivation fundamentally lies here. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"To know the incipient is to be divine"* (*Xici* II) and *"The trigger’s release is the master of honor and disgrace"* (*Xici* I). Those who study the sages should know their source.

Heaven gives life, heaven takes life—this is the principle of the Dao. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things; the ten thousand things are the thieves of humans; humans are the Dao of the ten thousand things. When the three thieves are fitting, the three powers are at peace. Thus, *"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are ordered; move the trigger, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace."* The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* emphasizes the word *"trigger,"* for life and death mutually depend and alternate. In their reversal lies the workings of creation.

*"Heaven gives life, heaven takes life—this is the principle of the Dao"* means that the Dao originally has no name; it is forcibly called *"Dao"* to guide people along the correct path. This correct path is the natural creation of heaven and earth. Natural creation does not exceed principle; the principle of heaven giving life and taking life *is* the Dao. Life and death have their trigger: in heaven, it is the trigger of time; in time, it is the trigger of *qi*. The *Book of Changes* says: *"To know the incipient is to be divine"* and *"The divine is that which subtly brings forth the ten thousand things"* (*Shuogua*). *"Incipient"* is the same as *"trigger,"* and only the divine can know it. The celestial body is empty and luminous, the master of creation—this is the one and divine. In humans, it is the original spirit of our fundamental nature. Only the movement and stillness of the original spirit of fundamental nature precisely accord with the trigger.

When the first yang revives, it is the *"living midnight"*; when the time comes and the spirit knows it, it is the *"living noon."* When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, spirit and *qi* naturally harmonize, so when the trigger of *qi* moves, the original spirit knows it. As Ancestor Qiu said: *"When *qi* races outward, spirit also races outward; when spirit returns to the root, *qi* also returns to the root."* If spirit is disturbed, it separates from *qi*, and the heart moves first while *qi* follows afterward—this is different. The movement of *qi* is the movement of the trigger; it is the time when heaven gives life and takes life. To know this is to know the Dao.

For at the winter solstice, the first yang is born; at the summer solstice, the first yin is born—this is the principle of heaven and also the principle of the Dao. The trigger of heaven’s life and death is the trigger of the Dao’s life and death. The ten thousand things of the cosmos are born from the principle-*qi* within the Supreme Ultimate. Principle-*qi* disperses throughout the cosmos, giving rise to the ten thousand things—principle-*qi* *is* the Dao. Heaven’s giving life is the Dao’s giving life; heaven and earth are also one thing within the cosmos, equally born from the Dao. Yet the Dao is formless, while heaven has form, so later people attribute merit to heaven and do not speak of the Dao. *"Heaven gives life, heaven takes life"* is *"the Dao gives life, the Dao takes life"*—the Dao is principle, so it is also called *"heavenly principle."*

Heaven’s having life and death is not that heaven does so; rather, it gives life where it cannot but give life and takes life where it cannot but take life. Why? The cosmos is limited, while the ten thousand kinds are boundless. If there is life without death, there would be the calamity of overflowing fullness.

The transformative *qi* of heaven and earth, if insufficient to nourish the ten thousand kinds, will lead to heaven and earth’s exhaustion. If there were killing without life, the six directions would grow desolate, and the dynamic *qi* of heaven and earth would nearly be extinguished. Thus, life and killing alternate, mutually increasing and decreasing in an endless cycle. As the *Kan Li Contract* states: *"The sun and moon are the Changes; hardness and softness correspond."* The Way of life and killing is the Way of hardness and softness, which is also the Way of the *Changes*. The waxing and waning of yin and yang proceed in endless alternation. When yin flourishes and yang wanes, and heaven and earth are blocked in stagnation, thunder stirs beneath the earth, forming the *Fu* hexagram. One yang arises beneath five yin—this is stillness at its extreme giving birth to yang, life emerging from within killing. Through *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, and *Guai*, one yang grows to six, returning to *Qian*. When yang flourishes, wind sweeps across the world, forming the *Gou* hexagram. One yin arises beneath five yang—this is movement at its extreme giving birth to yin, killing emerging from within life. Through *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, and *Bo*, one yin grows to six, returning to *Kun*. When *Bo* reaches its extreme, it reverts; when *Pi* reaches its extreme, it becomes *Tai*. One yang and six yin circulate endlessly, forming the world. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness turn like a ring, never losing their order—Fu Xi named this the "Great Ultimate." *Ji* means exhaustion; when exhausted, it transforms; when transformed, it flows. *Tai* means great, boundless, without inner or outer, beyond all form or likeness. Yet it does not exceed the principle that *"things at their extreme reverse."*

Delving deeper into the waxing and waning of yin and yang, one sees that yin is born of yang, and yang is born of yin. Only through killing does life arise; only through life does killing arise. Cold and heat, day and night, the waxing and waning of the moon—all are but the dynamic of movement and stillness. Without heat, there would be no cold; only with darkness does dawn come. The *qi* of the Five Phases circulates through the cosmos. *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the four cardinal directions: *zi* is water, *wu* is fire, *mao* is wood, *you* is metal, which together with central earth form the Five Phases. *Zi* is water, yet water normally overcomes fire, but fire is conceived in *zi*—thus water paradoxically gives birth to fire. *Wu* is fire, yet fire is overcome by water, but water is conceived in *wu*—thus fire also gives birth to water. Water normally overcomes fire, yet fire is conceived in *zi*—thus water paradoxically gives birth to fire. *Wu* is fire, yet fire is overcome by water, but water is conceived in *wu*—thus fire also gives birth to water. *Mao* wood and *you* metal likewise mutually overcome and mutually conceive—this is the principle of water and fire mutually containing life and killing, each lying latent within the other. As life arises, killing arises; as killing arises, life arises. Overcoming is itself generation, and their cyclical nature becomes even clearer.

For heaven’s killing dynamic is but the concealment of vital *qi*—it is not true killing. Why? Heaven’s seasons bring life in spring and growth in summer, harvest in autumn and storage in winter. Spring and summer are the time of vital dynamism; autumn and winter are the time of killing. Yet what is called killing is but gathering and storing; and what is stored is the vital dynamism itself. Today’s storage is tomorrow’s unfolding. Life is indeed life, but killing is also life—only one is concealed within, the other expressed without. Observe the trees: when frost descends and leaves fall, withering in injury, their roots are in fact more nourished than in spring and summer. Digging into the earth to examine the sap within the roots, one finds it thicker than in spring and summer—thus the vital *qi* returns to the root, not perishing. Examining the earth’s substance, one sees that in winter it freezes, as in the north of the Songhua River, where the frost penetrates seven feet deep. Yet seven feet below, it is quite warm, so that those who dwell in caves need not kindle fires. For the yang of spring and summer spreads above the earth...

The yang of autumn and winter lies concealed within the earth. When life’s dynamism prevails, external yang and internal yin form the *Li* trigram; when the force of decay prevails, external yin and internal yang form the *Kan* trigram. *Li* is dark within yet bright without, while *Kan* is bright without yet sunken within; *Li* governs growth, *Kan* governs storage. Whether in growth or storage, all is but theft—stealing the principle-*qi* of the Great Ultimate to bring forth creation.

The Great Ultimate is undifferentiated chaos. In movement, it generates yang, which is principle-*qi*; all things receive this to come into being, hence it is called "benevolence." In stillness, it generates yin, which is metal-*qi*; all things are completed through earth, hence it is called "righteousness." One yin, one yang; one generation, one completion—thus the world is formed, enduring through ten thousand kalpas unchanged.

From this we see that heaven and earth, and the myriad things, all arise from the principle-*qi* of the Great Ultimate. Thus, the myriad things steal the *qi* of heaven and earth to flourish or wither, while heaven and earth in turn steal the *qi* of the myriad things to circulate. Humans steal the *qi* of both heaven and earth and the myriad things, yet heaven, earth, and the myriad things also steal the *qi* of humans. Why is this so?

The myriad things sprout in spring and are harvested in autumn. When they grow, they steal the *qi* of heaven and earth; when harvested, heaven and earth steal their *qi*. The myriad things exist within heaven and earth, and all yin and yang *qi* are the *qi* of the myriad things. Heaven and earth and the myriad things mutually steal from one another: the myriad things steal the *qi* of heaven and earth to come into being, while heaven and earth steal the *qi* of the myriad things to bring about their decay. Only principle-*qi* is the primordial source of all existence, giving birth to heaven, earth, humans, and things. When all existence perishes, this *qi* returns to the Great Ultimate.

Within the heavens and earth, all things—whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation; whether flying, hidden, moving, or still; whether mountains, rivers, or the great earth—flow and rest, all reflecting this principle. Thus it is said: "Heaven and earth are the thieves of the myriad things." Here, heaven and earth stand in place of the Great Ultimate, opposing the myriad things. Yet heaven and earth are themselves but one thing, encompassed within the myriad things. The meaning is that the myriad things steal the *qi* of the Great Ultimate, while the Great Ultimate also steals the *qi* of the myriad things.

As for the saying, "The myriad things are the thieves of humans; humans are the thieves of the myriad things," humans and the myriad things likewise mutually steal from one another. Let us illustrate this with an example. As modern scientists explain, humans and all things depend on breath to live. Humans require nourishing *qi* (oxygen), for only with oxygen can they survive. Plants, however, are the opposite, requiring carbon (carbon dioxide) to live. Humans exhale carbon *qi* and inhale nourishing *qi*; plants exhale nourishing *qi* and inhale carbon *qi*. Thus, humans and plants mutually steal from one another to sustain their lives. This is one example.

Moreover, human life arises from the union of essence, *qi*, and spirit. This corporeal body is governed by spirit, lives by *qi*, and is nourished by essence. Yet the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind unconsciously steal and leak one’s essence, *qi*, and spirit. The myriad things, through their colors, sounds, scents, flavors, and textures, further steal the essence, *qi*, and spirit of humans. Unaware, our essence, *qi*, and spirit leak outward through the six senses—this is how humans are constantly stolen from by the myriad things.

Yet human life—clothing, food, shelter, and movement, along with all desires—depends entirely on things. Even jewels, carriages, horses, medicines, stones, birds, and beasts serve our needs, often at the cost of their lives. This is how humans steal from things. Thus, the myriad things steal from humans, and humans steal from the myriad things. Combined with the mutual theft between heaven, earth, and the myriad things, this forms the "Three Thefts."

The Three Thefts embody the natural principles of creation and destruction. The great thousandfold world is formed by these Three Thefts and will likewise be destroyed by them. That they can mutually steal and generate arises from the invisible, empty void, where the natural Dao governs—giving birth to heaven, earth, and the myriad things, yet not perishing with them. As the saying goes: "What has form will ultimately decay; only the formless is true."

The phrase "When the Three Thefts are fitting, the Three Powers are at peace" refers to the Three Powers: heaven, earth, and humans. When the Three Thefts each attain their proper place, heaven and earth are rightly positioned, and the myriad things flourish. The mechanism of generation and destruction is the mutual theft among heaven, earth, humans, and things. "Fitting" means humans align with the timing of the Dao and employ it appropriately.

For instance, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, when expressed in moderation, are called harmony. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world.

Silent and unmoving, this is the "center before arousal"; responsive and thus penetrating, it naturally arises in accord with the measure. "Measure" means the seasonal markers—just as the Dao of heaven has its differences of cold, heat, warmth, and cool, each responding to its proper season; so too human emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness form in accord with the heart’s conditions. Sincerity within takes shape without; stirred in the heart, it issues forth in emotion—thus there is nothing that does not accord with the measure. If one is obscured by private desires from external temptations, then what arises will not accord with the measure, and the "theft" will not attain its fitting place.

Why is this so? Human joy arises from compassion and love, like the generative impulse of heaven and earth in spring and summer; human sorrow and anger arise from grief and indignation, like the destructive impulse of heaven and earth in autumn and winter. What is the same in both is the single heart; what differs in their arising is the stimulus of the qi-mechanism. The *Classic of Difficult Issues* states, "Great anger harms the liver; great joy harms the kidneys"—the movement of the qi-mechanism within the body already distinguishes the five viscera, and what issues forth externally naturally differs as the seven emotions.

Moreover, in ordinary people at times of no particular event, each scene evokes a distinct emotion: encountering the brightness of spring, one’s countenance becomes joyful; facing the gloom of autumn, a hundred feelings arise. This is because the qi they "steal" differs, stirring the human heart and touching the mechanisms of generation or destruction to manifest.

"Eating in season, the hundred bones are ordered"—as the *Record of Rites* says, "Food and drink, male and female: these are the great human desires." One must follow the seasons to align with the fitting moment. For instance, in the heat of summer, one may sink plums and float melons; in the depths of autumn, one may face chrysanthemums and hold crab claws. But one must not force it—forced desire is greed. Extending this principle, one eats melons when summer brings them and bamboo shoots when spring offers them: these are all "eating in season." If one eats out of season, as in the *Liezi*, which says, "Drinking ice in winter—will I not suffer internal heat?"—for in winter one drinks broth and in summer water: this is the human norm. To reverse it and drink ice in winter is something only those with heat illness would do. When the hundred bones are disordered, one eats out of season; and only by eating out of season does one disorder the hundred bones, thus inflicting illness upon oneself and harming one’s life.

This pertains only to the physical form; if we speak in terms of Daoist cultivation, to ensure the "three thieves harmonize," one must first comprehend the fundamental principles of yin-yang creation. Know that all things are born of the *li-qi* of the Great Ultimate, and preserving this *li* allows for enduring longevity. The generation of *li-qi* has no fixed pattern, yet it is indeed fixed—seizing its timely moment, one may reverse the handle of heaven and earth’s life and death. Thus, the *li-qi* of the Great Ultimate may be stolen and drawn forth; the vital force of heaven and earth may be stolen and obtained. "Stealing" means to gather and take—sealing and preserving what is gathered can lead to long life; expanding and magnifying it further can unite one’s virtue with heaven and earth and one’s brightness with the sun and moon. All alchemical texts record this act of stealing: the circulating *qi* of the cosmos is stealing; stealing the *li-qi* of the Great Ultimate is also stealing. Only when one steals *li-qi* is it truly obtained. Once one theft is timely, the Three Powers naturally settle, allowing one to stand between heaven and earth and share their enduring vastness. The *Classic* speaks of "the three thieves in harmony"—this is what it refers to.

What is called "timeliness" here denotes the moment of firing times, the hour for gathering and ingesting the medicine. One who understands the heavenly Dao’s mechanism of life and death may cultivate and refine accordingly—knowing when to gather, when to nurture, and when to perform the Microcosmic Orbit—all of alchemical practice can be encompassed within the single word "timeliness." "Eating in season" is entry into sagehood, hence Confucius is called "the sage of timely centeredness." The heavenly mechanism cannot be seen, yet within timeliness, its workings may be known. When the mechanism moves, the time arrives; when the time arrives, the mechanism moves. Ingesting the great medicine and stealing the true yang of emptiness—there is no time without it, and no mechanism without timeliness. Seizing the mechanism is seizing the time.

This so-called "mechanism" is the mechanism of life and death, the moment for advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally. Within a single movement and stillness, both the *qi*-mechanism and the timely moment are complete. For example, the return of the first yang arises from the movement of the *qi*-mechanism—this is also the *zi* hour within the human body. Gathering and ingesting from this point is "eating in season," moving the mechanism. Moving the mechanism is the moment when the *qi*-mechanism first stirs. At this time, there is life and there is death; turning inward in sincerity transforms the death-mechanism into a life-mechanism, while following human desire turns the life-mechanism into a death-mechanism. Moving the mechanism and eating in season naturally strengthens the body—this "timeliness" refers to the living *zi* and living *wu* hours. At the first stir of the mechanism, it is the living *zi* hour; when the *qi*-mechanism flourishes, it is the true *zi* hour. Sensing its movement is the living *wu* hour; perceiving its flourishing is the true *wu* hour. Gathering and sealing it at these times naturally brings all transformations to harmony, and the divine transformations of the elixir are all contained within.

Yet when yang first stirs, one must be most cautious. At this moment, it is the death-mechanism; only when yang returns and is gathered is it the life-mechanism. Thus, when the mechanism moves, one must enter stillness to refine it, allowing true yang to ascend and circulate throughout the body. If the practice deviates from the proper method and leaks midway, it becomes the death-mechanism. In terms of firing times, when yang returns, one must stabilize—stabilizing is the death-mechanism; when returning, one must forget—forgetting is the life-mechanism. All ungathered gathering and unseized seizing occur when body and mind are both forgotten, naturally transforming the death-mechanism into the life-mechanism. Hence it is called "inversion" and "reversal."

People know the spirit’s spirituality but not the reason why the non-spiritual is spiritual. The sun and moon have their cycles, and great and small have their measures. Sagehood arises from this, and numinous clarity emerges. The spirituality of the spirit is the spirit of consciousness; the non-spiritual spirit is the original spirit. Only the original spirit knows when the time arrives. The *Canticle* says: "In sleep, the spirit embraces; in waking, it awaits life and death." To restore the original spirit, one must first cultivate the work of refining the self. Once the original spirit is restored, one then knows the movement and stillness of the *qi*-mechanism. The spirit of consciousness is only clever in thought but cannot sense the *qi*-mechanism in stillness.

People often know the spirit’s spirituality but not the non-spiritual spirit, nor do they seek the reason why the non-spiritual is spiritual—thus their spirit is not numinous. If one allows the spirit of consciousness to roam freely, ceaselessly disturbed, and yet hopes for the spirit and *qi* to embrace and become numinous enough to know the mechanism, it is exceedingly difficult. The method for seeking the non-spiritual spirit lies first in making emptiness extreme and stillness profound, merging into chaos, dissolving the spirit of consciousness. Then the original spirit appears and can respond with sensitivity. For the spirit that is clever in cunning yet cannot silently illuminate is the spirit of consciousness; the one that seems chaotic yet responds wondrously without fixed form is the original spirit—this is what *Laozi* means by "great skill appears clumsy, great wisdom appears foolish."

To seek the reason why the original spirit is spiritual, one must first return the spirit of consciousness to non-spirituality, banishing the six senses, utterly empty and hollow, knowing nothing. Only then does the non-spiritual original spirit become spiritual, able to embrace, to sense, to await life and death. The original spirit is the non-spiritual spirit, hence called the "chaotic original spirit." Only by being non-spiritual is it supremely spiritual; if it were like the spirituality of the spirit of consciousness, it would not be spiritual. Though the original spirit seems non-spiritual, to seize the yin-yang creation of heaven and earth, one must use this non-spiritual original spirit. The original spirit is empty and void, of the same kind as the *li-qi* of the Great Ultimate, thus it can resonate. When the *qi*-mechanism moves, true awareness follows.

The so-called practice of refining the self is precisely the practice of refining the original spirit. The original spirit arises from extreme stillness, adept at perceiving the movement of *qi*-mechanisms, hence called "when the time comes, the spirit knows." The phrase "the sun and moon have their cycles, the great and small have their measures" refers to the numinous nature of the original spirit, born from non-being and emerging from stillness, like the fixed and unchanging cycles of the sun and moon. The cycles of the sun and moon—such as the new moon, crescent, first quarter, full moon, waning phases, and dark moon—are especially evident in the moon’s waxing and waning. On the third day of the lunar month, a sliver of new moon appears, which is "the return of the first yang"; by the eighth day, the first quarter, "three yangs bring prosperity"; at the full moon, six yangs are complete, forming a perfect circle; by the sixteenth, the "first waning" begins, the moon losing a sliver; on the twenty-third, the last quarter, half the moon is gone, marking "the closure of heaven and earth"; by the dark moon, it becomes a pure *kun* state, entirely hidden. The moon completes one cycle each month, while the sun determines the seasons through the four phases, completing one cycle each year. Together, the sun and moon form the *Yi*, the Dao of yin-yang transformation. The transformations of yin and yang follow fixed cycles, and the non-spiritual spirit can know them because it is of the same kind and thus able to resonate. "The great and small have their measures" means yin is small and yang is great: when the small departs, the great arrives, and when the great departs, the small arrives, just like the rising and setting of the sun and moon. The sun completes one celestial cycle in a year, the moon in a month, and the great and small yin-yang complete one cycle each day and night. Because these cycles are fixed, the sage can know the past and infer the future, discern the movement of *qi*-mechanisms, seize the right moment to act, and thus achieve sagehood. By attaining this movement and ascending, sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas are made, and divine clarity emerges. Only by reaching the utmost emptiness and profound stillness does sagehood arise and divine clarity appear. The movement of *qi*-mechanisms is the resonance of *zi* and *wu*; the sage’s work lies precisely in this moment of *zi* and *wu*, where stimulus and response occur as instantly as a shadow following a pole. The North Pole of the earth is *zi*, and *wu* is the South Pole: when *zi* moves, *wu* perceives, *qi* stirs, and the spirit knows. Without the living *zi*, there is no living *wu*; yet without the living *wu*, there is also no living *zi*. Only when the spirit returns to non-spirituality does the living *zi* arrive, and the living *wu* becomes the very reason the non-spiritual becomes spiritual. This is what is meant by "inevitable response to stimulus": from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, divine clarity naturally arises, and the work of gathering and ingesting *qi* depends entirely on this. As for the "mechanism of theft," none in the world can see or know it. The noble person who attains it strengthens their body; the petty person who attains it squanders their life. The "mechanism of theft" lies in grasping the moment: to grasp it is to steal, and failing to grasp it means failing to steal. This mechanism of theft is unseen and unknown in the world because there are no sages. If there were sages, they would surely see and know it. Only by emptying the mind of preconceptions can the mechanism be seen; only by extinguishing discriminative knowledge can it be known. If one clings to prior knowledge, they will ultimately fail to see or know it. This mechanism of theft, when attained by the noble person, preserves life and wholeness, allowing them to share the longevity of heaven and earth—hence "the noble person who attains it strengthens their body." As the *Daoist Scripture* says, "Only when the heart dies does the spirit live." That is, the spirituality of the spirit of consciousness must die for the non-spiritual original spirit to be reborn. Only by extinguishing the spirit of consciousness can one recover the original spirit; only when the postnatal returns to chaos can the prenatal be restored. "Only after things are fully realized can knowledge be attained," and "only through overcoming thoughts can sagehood be achieved." As for those petty persons ensnared by material desires, they exploit the cunning of the spirit of consciousness. Even if they hear the Dao, they cannot return the spirit to non-spirituality. If they use the spirituality of the spirit of consciousness to steal the mechanism, it only hastens the loss of their life-essence. Indulging desires and violating natural principles, they cannot restrain themselves and return to propriety, ultimately bringing harm without benefit—hence "the petty person who attains it squanders their life." Those who preserve the original spirit are noble persons; those who rely on the spirit of consciousness are petty persons. The noble person, upon hearing the Dao, believes, accepts, and diligently practices it; the petty person, upon hearing the Dao, dismisses it and treats their life lightly. Some have interpreted "petty person" as one lacking virtue, whose insufficient virtue in practicing the Dao instead shortens their lifespan. This interpretation is logically sound but somewhat superficial.

The *Awakening to Reality* says, "The life-essence should not be lightly toyed with." The life-essence refers to the external yang, upon which human beings rely to become immortals—hence it is called the "life-essence." The term "essence" refers to the prenatal *qi* contained within it. When heaven and humanity unite in the moment of emptiness and stillness, the true yang of the prenatal stirs within the void, rising from the *yinqiao* vessel to enter the *mingmen*, causing the external form to stir. Simultaneously, it surges into the heart-mansion, and the original spirit becomes aware. This prenatal *qi*, which activates the *mingmen* and the heart-mansion, is the life-essence. "Should not be lightly toyed with" applies precisely to this moment. Indulging in reckless dissipation is the ravaging of the postnatal, not "lightly toying." "Lightly toying" means reckless gathering and extraction, where the firing times are mismatched. Petty persons, with their half-baked understanding, fail to explore the true principle and act recklessly—this is "squandering life." The prenatal *qi* is formless and invisible, soundless and odorless—who can see it? Who can know it? As the *Awakening to Reality* says, "It cannot be used when seen, and it cannot be seen when used."

In the midst of the indistinct and vague, they meet; within the profound and obscure, transformations occur. Because it has no form or appearance, it can be used but not seen—once seen, it has already transformed into the postnatal and lost its moment. At the very beginning of returning to the origin, in the primal chaos where yin and yang unite, one knows nothing, sees nothing, yet the *qi*-mechanism stirs therein, and therein one knows of its stirring. At this time, spirit and *qi* have merged, the medicine has been born, the gathering has been achieved, and the *qi* has already returned to its root—thus it can be seen and known, yet this is already after its use.

When stealing the mechanism, body and mind are in non-action, while spirit and *qi* naturally act. How can one know or perceive the actions of spirit and *qi*? Thus, those who attain the Dao truly attain nothing; if one seeks attainment, this is the "lightly toying" with the life-treasure. The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in seeing. Cutting off one source of profit yields tenfold returns; thrice returning day and night yields ten-thousandfold returns.

The blind are keen of ear because their eyes do not leak outward, and their spirit concentrates solely on the ears; the deaf are sharp of sight because their ears do not leak outward, and their spirit gathers entirely in the eyes. From this, we know that the nine orifices of the human body are all places where the Three Treasures exit and enter. Only by rectifying the heart and sincerely focusing the intent, cutting off external distractions, can essence, *qi*, and spirit naturally consolidate. One sees without seeing, hears without hearing—thus the true person dwells deep in the abyss, naturally at peace within.

The original spirit and the conscious spirit are fundamentally the same, differing only in movement and stillness. Cutting off external distractions and guarding the spirit in its abode—this is the original spirit as the "spirit that does not act as spirit." Not acting as spirit outwardly means the spirit acts inwardly.

The resonance of *qi*-mechanisms between heaven and earth is inherently swift. For example, the blind and deaf, though impaired in one sense, are keenly perceptive in another. The eye’s ability to see is the work of spirit; the ear’s ability to hear is the work of *qi*. The blind excel in hearing because the spirit extends to the ears; the deaf excel in sight because essence gathers in the eyes. Extending this principle, if we can let go of everything and not be ensnared by things, then ears and eyes will naturally be sharp, the original spirit and original *qi* will naturally return to the Yellow Court, and the Jade Fluid and Golden Fluid will arise accordingly.

"Cutting off one source of profit" means using a single source—this distinguishes the clarity or turbidity of the water’s origin. *Laozi* says, "The highest virtue is like water." This speaks of its purity. Water benefits all things; the Five Phases do not grow without earth, and the myriad things do not arise without earth. Cultivators must use the True One’s water, the purest water, which is the water’s source, the water-*qi*. When obtained, it is the prenatal *qi*. All tangible water is transformed from this *qi*. Cutting off profit from one source and using the True One’s water yields tenfold returns.

"Master" (*shi*), from the *Yijing*’s *Shi* hexagram, represents "earth over water." Using the True One’s water yields tenfold the effect of water within earth. For water within earth is tangible water, postnatal water; the True One’s water is formless water, prenatal water, whose source is utterly pure. The *Shi* hexagram of earth over water takes earth to restrain water, yet the water remains still and thus clear. However, the True One’s water is the water within *Li*, the true water within fire—thus it is tenfold purer than earth-water.

Cultivators must discern the water’s source and use the purest water for gathering; the slightest impurity renders it unusable. How then can it be made pure? It is like the deaf and blind: cutting off external agitation brings clarity. This is the medicine of Dao cultivation, the metal within water, the Qian-metal. Cutting off the external and seeking clarity from a single source, then applying the work of returning, can transform postnatal Kan and Li into prenatal Qian and Kun. Thus it is said, "Thrice returning day and night yields ten-thousandfold returns."

"Day and night" signifies one yin and one yang, containing Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li within. By inverting yin and yang and returning them, one naturally achieves ten-thousandfold the effect of using the master. Obtaining the True One’s water and performing the seven returns and nine reversions yields the Jade Fluid and Golden Fluid.

The *Shi* hexagram is taken as an image of water restrained by earth—still water, calm and unrippled. Yet though this water is clear, it is not the source. Drawing from the water’s source and returning it makes its efficacy manifest. Why is it called "master"? The master pertains to military affairs; this matter is like warfare. *Laozi* says, "Fine weapons are inauspicious." It also takes the image of warfare: Dao cultivation and warfare share the same principle. The empty must be filled, the full must be emptied; the subtlety of application lies in the mind. One must adjust according to the mechanism to achieve victory.

All elixir methods are called "battles"—the "battle of dragon and tiger," the "great battle"—they are fundamentally "intercourse." "Thrice returning day and night" also contains the meanings of *Zhun* and *Meng*. At dusk, *Zhun* retreats the tally; at dawn, *Meng* advances the fire. On one side, water draws lead; on the other, fire adds mercury. Returning is drawing and adding; morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng* are the balance of water and fire.

First obtaining the True One’s water, then balancing water and fire, and thrice returning day and night—this naturally yields ten-thousandfold the effect of using the master.

The heart is born from things and dies from things; its mechanism lies in the eyes. Heaven shows no favor yet gives rise to great favor—even in the clamor of thunder and fierce winds, all things stir unwittingly.

The heart arises from the myriad things and perishes with them. The essence of the heart is fundamentally empty, without form or appearance; it is only when forms and appearances excite it that it comes into being. The heart knows through seeing things and awakens through hearing affairs; it clings to things and follows them, leaving no emotion concealed—like a mirror that reflects a person when it faces a person and reflects an object when it faces an object, only then does perception arise. A child’s heart is originally without things; all knowledge comes from later habitual contamination—this is the heart arising from things. Not only is the heart born from things, but the world itself is formed by them. From the vastness of mountains, rivers, and the great earth to the smallness of grasses, trees, birds, and beasts—without these things, what would the world be? And the heart would not arise either. Precisely because of these myriad forms and colors, the world takes shape externally, and our hearts are born internally. For example, the existence of a stock exchange gives rise to the heart of buying, selling, and speculation; without such a thing, this heart would not arise. Whether tangible or intangible, the heart’s arising from things and affairs is one and the same.

When a person sleeps, they have no knowledge; only when an external thing disturbs them do they awaken. Our original heart is no different from when we sleep—empty and hollow, fundamentally without a single thing. Only when external circumstances touch the heart does the heart pursue them. Thus, before birth, it is the innate original nature; after birth, it becomes the acquired spirit of consciousness. Since the heart has birth and death, we humans have life and death. As worldly affairs grow daily more complex, and one heart must manage them all, people exhaust their essence and labor their spirits among things, giving rise to birth, aging, sickness, and death. If one could remain without knowledge or perception—seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing, eating without tasting—preserving the empty heart, then not being born means not dying.

Yet people let their hearts be enslaved by things, drowning in them. Even for a single trivial object, they exert their minds to seek its refinement. From youth to adulthood to old age, their craving never ceases, continuing until death. The heart is born from things and pursues them, thereby destroying its own life—this is the way of the world. Thus it is said to "die from things."

As for the phrase "its mechanism lies in the eyes," the eyes are where the spirit-light resides; the spirit dwells in the eyes daily. When things enter the field of vision, the heart immediately knows them—the heart’s movement begins in the eyes. Guanyin Bodhisattva has seventy-two transformations, yet cannot change her eyes. Thus, the ancients said that while the human body is entirely acquired, only the spirit-light in the eyes is innate—this is not without reason. The heart’s movement passes through the three essentials, and among them, the eyes are directly connected to the heart. Most movements of the heart enter through the eyes. For instance, when encountering beauty on the road, the eyes see it and the heart is immediately stirred, with extraordinary speed. If one hears lewd sounds with the ears, the sound must travel from the ears to the heart, and only after turning the thought does the heart move. Because the spirit resides in the eyes, what enters the eyes has already entered the heart.

Thus, when a person is about to die, the spirit in the eyes scatters first; in infancy, the eyes’ light is clear. Knowing that the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eyes, one has grasped the method of refining the self.

Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed and the hundred things are born. The body of heaven is empty and hollow; gazing at it from the ground, one sees only the azure qi of the sky, not its great height. Yet even when climbing to the summit of Kunlun, one still sees no change in its height. For heaven is emptiness—without seeing, hearing, speaking, or movement—yet cold and heat, yin and yang come and go in perfect measure, never losing their order through the ages. Though it seems to show no favor to things, within it lies great favor. Precisely because it is fundamentally empty, it can shelter the cosmos; precisely because it shows no favor, it can nurture the ten thousand kinds.

If the human heart could be as empty as heaven, then the creative transformations of heaven and earth would all be within our hearts. Our hearts would be equal in measure to heaven and earth, and we would stand alongside them. The boundless void has the power to cover and support heaven and earth, and our hearts share the same substance as the great emptiness. Only by being completely empty can one possess all abilities, nurture all things, and encompass all—possessing countless transformations, responding to all stimuli.

Heaven’s creative transformations also do not go beyond the four words "responding to stimuli and achieving communion." For example, in times of flood or drought, if people possess sincere hearts, their sincerity can move heaven, and heaven will respond—as in the prayers for rain at Sanglin or the burial of a child to obtain gold, both clear proofs. Precisely because heaven shows no favor, great favor arises. Thus, even the unwitting clamor of thunder and fierce winds manifests its efficacy within the emptiness, revealing its image.

When winter solstice arrives, "Earth Thunder Reverts"—a single yang arises from yin, thunder stirs beneath the earth, opening the creative transformations of spring. When summer solstice arrives, "Heavenly Wind Meets"—a single yin descends from yang, wind arises across the land, forming the scenery of autumn. Heaven’s life and death lie in the two seasons of spring and autumn. Thunder sounds in the second month and falls silent in the ninth; thunder is the qi of yang, the qi of life. When autumn arrives, the metal wind rises—the metal wind is the qi of killing. Though wind and thunder are unwitting and without knowledge, one hears their sounds but does not see their forms; in truth, they have no sound, but are stirred by things to resound. Yet wind and thunder are the transformations of yin and yang. The accumulation of yang becomes swift thunder; the accumulation of yin becomes fierce wind. Wind and thunder carry out the mechanism of life and death, while swift thunder and fierce winds are the times when life and death reverse.

One constant, one change—how could Heaven possess intent to bring them forth? It merely responds to stimuli, moving unwittingly. In the *Book of Changes*, thunder and wind are the eldest son and eldest daughter, one yin, one yang, succeeding the father and mother of Qian and Kun to govern. Thus, Heaven and Earth’s life and death are revealed only in thunder and wind, and their mechanism of reversal lies herein. Herein too lies the absence of favor that gives rise to great favor. The sage, participating in Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturance, must seek that which is called "without favor" in order to extend favor to the myriad things. Without favor is without intent; without the intent to transform and nurture the myriad things, the myriad things naturally transform and nurture themselves. Supreme joy leaves a surplus of nature; supreme stillness yields the integrity of nature (alternatively: *then* integrity). Heaven’s utmost partiality is employed with utmost impartiality.

This passage extends the principle of "without favor," which is identical to "non-action." When the heart reaches supreme joy, celestial nature drifts freely and at ease, as if with leisure to spare. When the heart reaches supreme stillness, celestial nature arises spontaneously, as if treading a broad and smooth path. When we refine the self to the state of primordial chaos, the heart suddenly becomes luminous—this is "supreme stillness yielding the integrity of nature." Shortly after, the heart feels unbounded delight, indescribable—this is "supreme joy leaving a surplus of nature." Supreme joy is true joy.

"Heaven’s utmost partiality is employed with utmost impartiality" means that when comparing human nature to celestial nature—though it is private to the individual, as it is received from Heaven—every person is thus, regardless of wisdom, folly, worthiness, or unworthiness, all the same. If what is most private is in fact most impartial, nature equals the vast emptiness of Heaven, utterly impartial and without favor. Thus, the nature bestowed by Heaven has no distinction of good or not-good. When Heaven occasionally sends forth wind and thunder, it may seem highly partial, yet it acts in accordance with the seasons, unchanged across ten thousand ages—this is an example of Heaven’s utmost partiality employed with utmost impartiality.

The restraint of the *qin* lies in qi. Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm; harm arises from favor. Sinking into water or entering fire is self-inflicted destruction.

(*Qin* is interchangeable with *qin* [to capture]; the ancient characters are identical. "The restraint of the *qin* lies in qi" means that when qi races outward, to withdraw the heart, one must apply the effort of restraint, as if capturing it from without. By capturing it from without and returning the heart, one receives the seasonal imagery of Heaven, and joy’s surplus and stillness’s integrity arise. This must be achieved by restraining with qi, so the heart remains unmoved and returns to its original substance—this is the meaning of the first chapter of *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*: "True earth captures true lead; true lead restrains true mercury. Lead and mercury return to true earth, and body and heart become still and unmoving.")

True earth can capture true lead; true lead is primordial true yang, and true mercury is true yin. When both return to earth, body and heart become still and unmoving. True earth is true intent, the pure heart unstained by the six dusts. This matter first requires refining the self, as in *Journey to the West* when Bull Demon King returns to the truth—this is the moment. For the primordial Great Dao lies entirely in true intent, which must be restrained by primordial qi. As for the acquired spirit of consciousness, which constantly races outward, this is the *Li* trigram, which must be captured and subdued by primordial qi. It is like taming a dragon: primordial qi is metal within water, which is true lead. If one can subdue it, the *Li* trigram transforms into the *Qian* trigram—this is "taking from Kan to fill Li," the work of returning from the acquired to the primordial.

"Death is the root of life; life is the root of death" refers to the mechanism of life and death, mutually concealed within each other. Zi, Wu, Mao, and You mutually overcome and mutually gestate; thus, death is the root of life, and life is the root of death. Favor and harm are likewise akin to life and death, extending to life. If one can sink water into fire, fire is restrained by water and naturally perishes. When Kan water is used to fill Li fire, the spirit of consciousness is extinguished, and the primordial spirit is born. These lines all refer to the spirit of consciousness and the primordial spirit: returning from the spirit of consciousness to the primordial spirit is "favor arising from harm"; extinguishing the primordial spirit with the spirit of consciousness is "harm arising from favor." Self-inflicted destruction means the human heart perishes, and the Dao heart arises, the primordial spirit appears. At this point, the work of cultivating the Dao is complete, hence it is said that cultivating the Dao lies solely in the single step of "refining the self."

The foolish revere Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sagely; I revere the patterns of the seasons and things as wise. People revere foolish vigilance as sagely; I revere the absence of foolish vigilance as sagely.

The foolish revere peculiarity as sageliness; I revere the absence of peculiarity as sageliness. (One version omits the following four lines.) The foolish regard knowledge of astronomy and geography as sageliness; I, however, do not, but instead take the patterns of the seasons and things as essential, knowing the qi-mechanisms of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation, as well as the inherent principles of the myriad things. Possessing these two, I deem them wisdom.

People revere foolish vigilance as sageliness, engaging in reasoned discourse and broad debate of past and present; I, knowing nothing of any particular thing, do not regard this as sageliness. People revere extraordinary deeds that astonish others as sageliness; I revere the ordinary and unassuming as sageliness. For astonishing peculiarity is not the Way of the Mean. The Dao lies in harmonizing one’s light with the dust, and only those who know the Way of daily use are sages.

The cycles of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation are fixed. Their pivot lies in the qi-mechanism. Scholars, by returning from breadth to simplicity, can grasp this pivot and reduce the myriad differences to a single root; thus, even a thousand or ten thousand generations hence, all may be known. Those who cultivate in accordance with this are the sages who continue the past and inaugurate the future.

The Way of Nature is quiescent, hence Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Way of Heaven and Earth is gradual, hence yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang interact and transform, and change proceeds in accord. As *Laozi* says: “Humans model themselves on Earth, Earth on Heaven, Heaven on the Dao, and the Dao on Nature.” The Way of Nature lies in quiescence; only in quiescence and non-movement do Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things arise. This is the Way of Nature, which is also the Supreme Ultimate. Empty and still, without movement, hence Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born from it.

The Way of Heaven and Earth is gradual, meaning it follows Nature’s gradual progression. Heaven and Earth are empty and without intent; when yang ascends, it gradually rises; when yin descends, it gradually falls. Thus, there are times when yin or yang prevails, but the Way of the Supreme Ultimate’s Nature remains impartial and unbiased. Gradualness entails partiality: when yin encroaches on yang, yin prevails; when yang encroaches on yin, yang prevails. Yet this is the principle of mutual interaction and cyclical alternation. Viewed in its entirety, it remains impartial and unbiased. However, humans are thus subject to birth, aging, illness, and death.

“Yin and yang interact”: when yang prevails through interaction, it is spring and summer; when yin prevails through interaction, it is autumn and winter. “Change proceeds in accord” means proceeding in accord with the heart-mind of Nature’s Way. Thus, the sage knows Nature’s Way cannot be violated and therefore regulates it (one version reads: “Thus, the sage knows Nature cannot be acted upon and therefore guards and regulates it with the Dao”).

The Way of utmost quiescence cannot be matched by calendrical calculations. Yet there exists a marvelous mechanism from which the myriad images arise. The Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle conceal divine and subtle workings; the arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming are manifestly evident in their images. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born from Nature’s Way. Though there are times when yin overcomes yang, all proceed in accord with Nature. The sage knows this Way cannot be violated. If one follows this Way, one naturally becomes an immortal or a sage.

Following Nature’s unchanging Way, one establishes methods of cultivation, sets fixed standards, and formulates oral instructions—all of which are definite and unalterable. Simply embodying emptiness and naturalness, one may become an immortal or a buddha. Nature’s Way arises from the Way of utmost quiescence; through quiescence, creation and transformation naturally arise.

The “Way of utmost quiescence” cannot be matched by calendrical calculations. Within this quiescence lies Heaven’s creation and transformation. By attaining quiescence for even a moment, one may accumulate a year’s qi. Yang’s arising is the winter solstice; yin’s descent is the summer solstice—these are the winter and summer of practice, not the winter and summer of the seasons. By attaining extreme emptiness and profound quiescence, one may grasp creation and transformation in the realm of the indistinct.

There exists a marvelous mechanism from which the myriad images arise; the Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle all emerge from it, which is the Supreme Ultimate: in the world, it is the Supreme Ultimate that generates Heaven, Earth, humans, and things; in the human body, it is the Supreme Ultimate of spirit and qi’s fusion. The arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming are manifestly evident to all, not hidden or obscure. Though their principles are not easily understood, their images are readily apparent. This is the Mysterious Pass, the Supreme Ultimate within the human body, which, like the Supreme Ultimate of Heaven and Earth, contains the Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle, concealing divine and subtle workings that are difficult to fathom. Yet their images are outwardly manifest and knowable. By investigating these images to plumb their principles, the source of yin and yang’s creation and transformation becomes as clear as the palm of one’s hand.

**Lecture Thirteen: Master Shi’s Heart-Transmission and the Moon’s Fullness in Oral Instructions**

*East at mao, west at you, south at wu, north at zi.*

The alchemical classics often contain two phrases: “The *zi* of time lies in heart-transmission; the fullness of the moon depends on oral instructions.” These words are of utmost importance in the elixir method. Here, I will explain them in detail as follows:

The Perfected One Bai Ziqing’s *Disquisition on Resolving Doubts* states: “In the superior elixir method, spirit, essence, hun-soul, po-soul, and intent serve as medicinal ingredients; movement, stillness, sitting, and reclining constitute the firing times; and attuning to natural spontaneity is the method of operation.” The firing times are the work itself, and operation is the application. For the primordial Great Dao, the first requirement is to release body and mind, allowing them to follow their natural course—no trace of force may be applied. Any coercion will prevent the elixir from forming. The primordial is the Void; only when one accords with the Void does one attain the primordial. Empty the mind within and the body without; only when both inner and outer are empty can one engage in the practice of emptiness. Nature belongs to the mind, life to the body; when both body and mind are forgotten, nature and life unite, giving rise to creation and transformation. If one forgets the body but not the mind, or forgets the mind but not the body, neither is the primordial. Emptiness is distinguished between true emptiness and dull emptiness. True emptiness is not empty—within it lies wondrous existence—this alone is true emptiness. The mind contains no notion of emptiness; in perfect stillness, this may be verified. For instance, upon just awakening from sleep, all thoughts are empty, and the mind is devoid of any object—this is true emptiness. If one deliberately maintains emptiness in the mind, one cannot attain emptiness; this is dull emptiness. The myriad volumes of elixir classics all teach the cultivation of an empty mind, yet emptying the mind is the most difficult of all. If one forcibly restrains the mind to make it empty, the more one restrains, the less empty it becomes. One must employ the method of naturalness: when a thought arises, immediately become aware of it; with awareness, it vanishes—this is self-emptying. When a thought arises, become aware of it. Awareness can halt thoughts, hence it is said, “It rests in supreme goodness.” Awareness is cessation; supreme goodness is a single awakening. If one recognizes the movement of thought yet adds another thought to suppress it, one cannot attain emptiness, for there already exists a thought of restraint within. The method of returning to the Void is the refinement of thoughts; when thoughts are eliminated, one can return to the Void. Forgetting both externally and internally, one forms a void body, which can then generate existence from non-existence and engender yang from extreme stillness. Once yang arises, the mind must be able to gather and contain it to retreat yin; if it cannot be gathered, yang will not reach the body. Once gathered, one must further retain it; if it cannot be retained, it will vanish in an instant—hence the importance of firing times. Once gathered and sealed, with daily accumulation over months, yang naturally becomes full, and yin naturally retreats, enabling one to revert from old age to youth. What was previously deficient is replenished by newly acquired yang, not only restoring what was lost but also accumulating new yang—thus one can revert and return. When the body returns to the time of five thousand four hundred births of the Yellow Path, it becomes vast and expansive, all things flourish and prosper, teeth regrow and hair turns black, old women revert to maidens, and the decrepit transform into robust men—this is certain. The method begins with reverting to pure *Kun* and forming a void body, yet attaining the void state is not easy, which is why both nature and life must be cultivated together. Forget the mind, and the mind becomes empty and still; forget the body, and the body becomes empty and still. An empty mind is the inner *Kun* hexagram; an empty body is the outer *Kun* hexagram. The union of inner and outer *Kun* is the union of inner and outer emptiness. When the two *Kun* combine to form the *Kun* hexagram, this is the return to the Void, and only then can yang be generated. Yang arises from the outer *Kun* hexagram, yet the inner *Kun* truly responds to it. By gathering it according to the method and retaining it in the body, one can retreat yin and advance yang—at this point, a distinct vision unfolds.

What is meant by the “living *zi* hour”? The *zi* hour is midnight, the time when a day begins at *zi* and ends at *hai*. The *hai* hour is the time of extreme yin. At the *zi* hour, yang begins to revive, though humans remain unaware—only the rooster senses it first and crows upon awakening. The rooster is sensitive to qi; when yang qi arises from the earth, it stimulates the rooster’s body. Receiving this qi, the rooster is startled awake and crows. Yang qi arises from the earth each day without fail, so the rooster’s crowing also remains unchanged. The living *zi* hour is the time of yang’s birth. In the southern provinces, roosters crow at *chou*, while in the northern provinces, they crow at *zi*, demonstrating that yang qi’s generation moves from north to south, with the *Kan* palace receiving qi first. The *zi* hour also derives from the Winter Solstice. As Shao Yong said: “At the midpoint of *zi* in the Winter Solstice, the heart of Heaven remains unchanged. Where the first yang stirs, all things are yet unborn.” The midpoint of *zi* is the midpoint of the *zi* month—this is the time when the heart of Heaven manifests, occurring every year without fail across ten thousand kalpas. Though yang stirs, all things remain unborn, hence the comparison to *zi*. In terms of creation, by the tenth month, all is stripped away. At the transition between *hai* and *zi*, the *Kun* hexagram is pure. Thus, in winter, all things withdraw and conceal themselves, presenting the image of pure yin. At the Winter Solstice, yang returns to revive, forming the *Fu* hexagram. *Fu* signifies the return of the creative transformation of spring. The first half of the month before the Winter Solstice is the time of pure yin, the image of pure *Kun*, derived from the *Bo* hexagram. The *Bo* hexagram pertains to the latter half of the ninth month and the first half of the tenth month, stripping away all yang qi, treading frost and solid ice. While yang qi is not yet exhausted, insects and plants can still barely endure, so in early tenth month, leaves have not all fallen, and insects still make sounds. By late tenth month and early winter, when yang is exhausted, insects and snakes all become torpid. Without yang qi, they cannot move; when yang is exhausted, they hibernate and remain still. When frost and ice strip everything away, the stripping is complete—this is pure *Kun*. At the Winter Solstice, within pure *Kun*, yang is born anew.

The *Fu* hexagram arises from below as renewal, while the *Bo* hexagram strips away from above. When stripping is complete, yang qi retreats and conceals itself below, which is why in the coldest depths of winter, digging six or seven *chi* beneath the earth reveals no frost, and deeper still, warmth is found—this is the yang qi. Heaven’s qi ascends, earth’s qi descends, sealing all in the bitterness of winter. By spring, yang is restored once more.

I once heard Master Chen of geomancy say that in winter, the depth of frozen earth can be measured in *chi*, and when this number is divided by six, it invariably yields a whole number. He tested this by digging in the five northern provinces, and it held true without exception. This demonstrates the subtlety of the *Kun* hexagram’s use of six—a remark grounded in experience, and perhaps not without merit.

In winter, yang qi hides profoundly deep. Grasses and trees wither but do not die, for their roots lie buried in the earth, sustained by yang qi. Insects and snakes exposed to the cold perish, but those hibernating in deep valleys and earthen dens are preserved by yang qi. Thus, in great mountains and marshes, creatures burrow downward to hibernate, consuming their own marrow. Without the yang beneath the earth, they could not survive. As the *Yi* says, “The hidden dragon does not act”—yang lies below.

At the Winter Solstice, the first yang returns, forming the *Earth-Thunder Fu* hexagram. From this point, yang gradually revives. The *Yi* speaks of “renewal revealing the heart of heaven and earth,” for here we see the great cyclic heart of creation. The celestial heart turns ceaselessly in its round; the true yang of heaven and earth appears at the Winter Solstice. Though humans may not perceive it, the qi of heaven and earth has already transformed. At this time, yang grows and yin wanes. The essence of the great yang’s qi lengthens the days. Conversely, when yin waxes and yang wanes, the days shorten—this is the Summer Solstice.

Before the Winter Solstice, the days have reached their shortest extreme. Thus, the first yang returns, born within the earth, gradually reviving and growing. By the time of the second yang, the *Lin* hexagram, this can be observed. Tree branches contain sap: in the eleventh month, it is scarce, but by the twelfth month, it increases. The mulberry tree, which receives qi earliest, sprouts leaves even in winter. In the tenth month, plum blossoms first open on southern ridges, where the earth is warm and yang arrives early.

Though the first yang has returned, the myriad things have not yet come to life. They await the third yang, which arrives in the first month. The *huozi* hour emerges from the Winter Solstice. Considering a single day, day is yang and night is yin. At midnight, the *zi* hour, yang is born; by the *xu* and *hai* hours, yin reaches its extreme. The *zi* hour is the moment when yang first stirs. In alchemical practice, this is the *huozi* hour, the “living *zi*”; midnight’s *zi* hour is the “dead *zi*.” The yang generated within the body is not fixed but alive, arising whenever stillness is attained—hence the term “living.” Even if one cultivates at noon, yang can be generated, making it a *huozi*. For this *zi* hour is the moment when both body and mind are still, and yang is born—not a fixed *zi* hour, but a “living *zi* hour.”

The *Four Hundred Characters* states: “The Summer Solstice is not at *wu*; the Winter Solstice is not at *zi*.” This is precisely the point. The moment when yang is born is likened to the *huozi* hour, for at this time, yang has just begun to stir, and the myriad things have not yet come to life. This is crucial for the elixir’s formation. Beyond the *huozi* hour, there is also the “true *zi* hour”: the *huozi* hour marks the return of yang qi, while the true *zi* hour is when yang, having been born, reaches the body.

At first, its presence is faint—like a single point. It must be nurtured to fullness so that it may grow and be felt throughout the body. If yang is too tender and has not yet reached the body, it cannot be gathered. Nurturing it to fullness is the work of fire timing, requiring the steadfastness of *ding* to cultivate it.

When one first practices and both body and mind attain stillness, yang is born—this is the *Earth-Thunder Fu* hexagram. If it has not yet reached the body, one must remain in *Kun*, for *Kun* is what gives birth to yang. Should there be the slightest deviation from pure *Kun*, yang will cease to arise. Yang is born at specific times, and those who know its root can perceive it. If, upon seeing the signs, one’s thoughts stir and one speculates about the nature of yang qi, yang will not return. For the qi initially obtained is subtle, and one must not move in the slightest. It must be guarded and further nurtured, which is why the work of *ding* is required.

*Ding* means fixing upon one. The spirit within the heart is fixed upon the inner and outer emptiness. When the spirit is fixed externally, completely detached from the body, the body becomes even more empty, and yang qi can then be fully generated. When yang qi is present, signs appear in the body—one feels a pervasive comfort and softness, the moment when yang has grown to fullness. The heart is filled with joy.

Once yang has reached fullness, one must employ the work of *wang* (forgetting). Even the spirit fixed externally must be forgotten. *Wang* is the ungathered gathering—the work of harvesting. *Ding* is the work of nurturing. At this point, the skin and flesh of the entire body may twitch, as if fleas were crawling upon it. One must still forget. Yet when the body is suffused with a melting numbness and forgetting is no longer possible, one must cease the fire, either rising to walk slowly or casually reading a Daoist text. This is the time to cease the fire and seal the elixir. If one does not cease the fire and seal it, the yang qi, having reached its fullest, will generate heat and transform into sweat, dispersing as postnatal qi. Thus, the work of *zhi* (cessation) is most essential and must not be neglected.

There is also a “living *wu* hour.” The *wu* hour corresponds to the Summer Solstice; the living *wu* hour is when the first yin is born. In theory, *wu* is when yin arises. The living *wu* hour pertains to the heart, and the movement from body to heart is the *Li* hexagram.

Within *Li* lies emptiness; when stirred, the *Li* hexagram marks the moment when the first yin is born. When yang arises, it manifests as a vision—first appearing beyond the skin and flesh, then moving inward toward the heart, where awareness awakens. In the state of emptiness, all is profound obscurity; when yang stirs, it becomes a fleeting glimmer. The moment it surges into the heart, one feels the body’s vision as a melting numbness, like the rising of yang—this is the living *wu* hour. *Zi* and *wu* stand opposite; when awareness reaches the heart, it is the living *wu* hour, requiring the practice of *ding* (stabilization).

*Zi* and *wu* differ by six hours, yet in truth they occur in an instant—from *zi* one arrives at *wu*. *Zi* and *wu* are the north and south poles; the moment one is reached, the other is known. The body is the living *zi* hour, the heart the living *wu* hour; to awaken at *zi* and perceive at *wu*—this is their distinction. The living *wu* hour corresponds to the Summer Solstice, represented by the *Tianfeng Gou* hexagram, for six yang lines form *Qian*, occurring in the fourth month. When *Qian* reaches its extreme, yang culminates and yin is born—this is the fifth month, culminating at the Summer Solstice when the first yin arises, descending from heaven as the *Gou* hexagram. How is this known? When yang reaches its peak and becomes excessive, the first yin arrives as *Gou*, and great rains fall in season. Yin and yang unite to form rain and dew; the days are at their longest, and from the Summer Solstice onward, they gradually shorten. By the sixth month, two yin lines form the *Dun* hexagram; by the seventh month, three yin lines form the *Pi* hexagram.

In the third month, the *Zetian Guai* hexagram—five yang and one yin—heralds the blooming of myriad flowers. The fifth day of the fifth month, when the sun shines at its zenith, marks the extreme of yang—hence it is called the "Heavenly Midpoint Festival." Yang at its peak gives birth to yin; thus the ceaseless cycle of heaven and earth’s transformations is revealed. Within the living *zi* and *wu* hours, there are also the *mao* and *you* hours. *Zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, and *si* are the six yang hours; *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai* are the six yin hours. Since *zi* and *wu* exist, *mao* and *you* lie between them. *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are the four cardinal directions, occupying the north, south, east, and west—all others are the four corners. Various texts describe these eight directions, adding the central palace to form the nine palaces.

The four cardinals in the celestial heart are the *Tiangang*; the Dipper’s bowl resides at the center as the *Beichen*, also called the *Purple Tenuity*. What encircles and moves is the Dipper’s handle within the North Pole. As the handle shifts, the year’s seasons are divided. The twelve months differ according to the handle’s direction, while the Dipper’s bowl remains unmoving at the center. *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* may also be distinguished thus. The midpoint of the Dipper’s handle is the fixed pivot star—like the body and heart. When body and heart are still, true intention resides at the center, and spirit and qi naturally unite, dividing into *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.

Yang’s arising is *zi* and *wu*; bathing is *mao* and *you*. *Zi* and *wu* stand opposite as north and south; *mao* and *you* stand opposite as east and west. To mention *wu* is to encompass *mao*; to mention *zi* is to encompass *you*. When yang arrives and is perceived, it is *zi* and *wu*, with *mao* and *you* contained within. As the *Canon* states: “At *zi*, turn left; at *wu*, rotate west.” (Originally: “At *zi*, turn right; at *wu*, rotate east.”) *Zi* and *wu* descend simultaneously; when *zi*’s yang qi reaches *mao*, *wu*’s yin qi reaches *you*. This is illustrated in the diagram. *Mao* and *you* occur together—from *zi* to *wu* conceals *mao*; from *wu* to *zi* conceals *you*.

Heaven has four images: heaven and earth, sun and moon—*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—heaven to the south, earth to the north, sun to the east, moon to the west. The elixir method has *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*: *wu* to the south, *zi* to the north, *mao* to the east, *you* to the west—all are but symbols. If distinguished, they become: *zi* moves, *wu* awakens; *mao* rests, *you* ceases. *Zi* to the north, *wu* to the south; *mao* and *you* to the east and west. At *zi*, yang ascends; at *wu*, yin descends. When *mao* and *you* arrive, yin and yang balance—this is the time of bathing. Bathing occurs at the central palace, like the fixed pivot star within the Dipper’s bowl. Here is emptiness: yang ascends from below, yin descends from above. Employing the practice of *wang* (forgetting), one naturally seals the yang qi within, obtaining the elixir.

Such are the teachings of the elixir method—all are but analogies and must not be rigidly adhered to. As the *Four Hundred Words* states: “When it is time for bathing, *mao* and *you* are also empty comparisons.” This is evident. During the great celestial cycle, the movement of yang qi has tangible signs; during the small celestial cycle, the movement of yang qi is still subtle, and the body’s yin qi remains heavy, so one cannot fully perceive it. In the great cycle, the dharmakāya is present, and one knows its ascent and descent; in the small cycle, one only feels a melting numbness.

To forget body and heart is the meaning of *wenyang* (warm nurturing). When one wishes to forget but cannot, yang is full—one must immediately cease the fire. This is the distinction of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. The above explains the principle of “the *zi* of time, whose subtlety lies in heart transmission.” Next follows the principle of “the fullness of the moon, preserved in oral instructions.”

Elixir masters take *Qian* and *Kun* as heaven and earth, *Kan* and *Li* as sun and moon, and employ the functions of *Kan* and *Li*. Within the sun is the golden crow; within the moon is the jade hare—thus the crow and hare are taken as the medicinal substances. The principle of the moon’s fullness is the celestial pattern left by heaven and earth for refining the elixir. The sun’s light is eternally whole, unchanging through the ages; the moon waxes and wanes, differing each day, each day presenting a new image. The moon has no light of its own—it is the essence of *Taiyin*, represented by the *Kan* hexagram, internally yang and externally yin.

The outer yin is thus without light, borrowing the sun’s light to shine. Heaven and earth intersect at the summer and winter solstices, while the sun and moon meet once each month. On the day of the moon’s waning, the sun is above in the heavens, the moon below on earth, and they intersect within the earth. Sun and moon face each other, and the moon absorbs the sun’s light. The moon is a body of pure yin, hollow and empty, and by its emptiness can receive—what goes out returns as what enters—thus it absorbs the sun’s light. After three days, it appears in the *geng* direction, gradually releasing its light, its form like a moth’s eyebrow. The *geng* direction is the east; *geng* belongs to *Zhen*, and *Zhen* receives *geng*, hence it is called the *geng* direction. At this time, only a crescent of new moon appears. Three days prior, on the twenty-eighth day, the moon is but a sliver, nearly waning to extinction. The moon first appearing in *geng* is no different in size from the sliver about to vanish.

From the fourth day onward, each day adds a thread of light, no different from the accumulation of yang in elixir refinement, built up bit by bit. By the eighth day, the moon forms a half-circle, appearing in the *dui-ding* direction—the *dui* direction is due west—called the “upper quarter.” It resembles a bow, one side the bow’s back, the other the bowstring. The bowstring faces upward toward the east, hence it is called the “upper quarter,” its edge as straight as a cord. Yin and yang are each half, meaning within the yin there is half yang. If considered as a full circle, half is bright while the other half is hidden; even if unseen, it is because half remains—this is the moon of the eighth day. Thereafter, each day adds another thread of light, until the fifteenth day’s full moon, which appears in the *qian-jia* direction. Moving from west to east, it faces the sun and its light is full.

A song says:
*Toad and hare’s spirit, sun and moon’s qi shine as one.*
*The toad watches the hexagram’s node, the hare spits to give birth to light.*
*The Dao of elixir refinement is complete—bending and stretching, low and high.*

Toad and hare’s spirit, sun and moon’s dual brightness: the toad symbolizes *Taiyin*, crow and hare symbolize *Taiyang*. The toad is the essence of yang, a creature born in water, lifting its head to the heavens to absorb the sun’s qi. The hare, seeing the moon, exhales qi; it has no gender, facing the full moon on the fifteenth day to exhale and conceive, giving birth from its mouth. One inhale, one exhale—symbolizing one day and one month. The *Huangting Jing* says: *“Exhale with the sun, inhale with the moon.”* One inhale and yin descends; one exhale and yang ascends, comparing the ascent and descent of yin and yang. The toad’s inhalation draws inward to gather; the hare’s exhalation turns outward to return. Exhaling outward is likened to the moon: by the fifteenth day, it has exhaled all its yang light.

On the day of the new moon, when sun and moon intersect, a dark shadow falls upon the moon. Thereafter, yang light gradually accumulates and increases, until the fifteenth day when it is full—the moon’s light is the sun’s light. On the fifteenth, the moon is full, and the sun is also full. The dual mention of sun and moon compares essence and life, spirit and qi. By the sixteenth, the moon begins to wane, and yin grows. From the full moon of the fifteenth, yang recedes and yin advances; the abundant *Qian* metal gradually diminishes. By the twenty-third day, it appears in the south, in the *xun-xin* direction, only half remaining, black and white each half—this is the “lower quarter” moon. The bowstring faces downward, within yang there is half yin. From below to above, it resembles the upper quarter, where yang arises from below, and within yang half of yin has already been born.

Thereafter, each day darkness advances and light retreats, until the twenty-eighth day when the moon is but a sliver, and by the new moon it is entirely consumed. This occurs every month without the slightest deviation, and from the moon one can know the waxing and waning of each month. China’s lunar calendar derives from the moon, and by observing this one understands the reasons for each month’s new moon, crescent, quarter, and full moon. The elixir method takes its pattern from the moon: the time when yang qi is fully born is the time of the full moon. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: *“On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—precisely when metal’s essence is strong and abundant.”* At this time, water is full and metal is replete—the image of the *Qian* hexagram. The full moon is the *wang* day; the pure, hollow body of *Kun* is the new moon. The intersection of sun and moon is the union of spirit and qi, entering the primordial chaos to give birth to subtle yang—like the moon of the third day. The yang born at the living *zi* hour is also like a crescent of new moon. Yin and yang each half resemble the upper and lower quarters of the moon.

The upper quarter moon’s lower half is half yang, the upper half half yin. When yang qi accumulates to half in the body, the body’s yin qi retreats by half—the receded yin is the dark upper half. Yin and yang each form a half-circle, and in the elixir method, the so-called “full moon” is the round moon formed by half yin and half yang—this is the “full moon,” not the usual full body of pure yang, distinct from the full moon of the *wang* day. Now assume the half of yang qi born is the upper quarter, and the half of yin qi receded is the lower quarter; upper and lower combine to form the full moon. The upper quarter is in the body, the lower quarter in the heart; body and heart unite to become the full moon. At this time, metal and water are each half, the hour meets *er ba* (sixteen), the medicinal sprout is newly tender—precisely the moment for harvesting. Proceeding from “stabilization,” one turns to the work of “forgetting.” The *zi* hour turns east to *mao* to form the upper quarter—this is the advance of yang.

The *wu* hour turns west to *you* to form the lower quarter—this is the retreat of yin. When *mao* and *you* unite simultaneously, they form the full moon, precisely the moment for harvesting and completing the elixir; the method here should employ "bathing" and "warm-nurturing." For this is the time when yin and yang are balanced, mercury and lead each at half; metal and wood intersect, bearing both punishment and virtue. Moreover, the upper quarter is the qi of the Green Dragon’s arc, the lower quarter the qi of the White Tiger’s arc; when upper and lower combine, the medicinal sprout is neither overripe nor too tender—just right for harvesting. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says, “On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the metal essence is at its peak”—this is exactly it.

What is called “harvesting” is the harvest of non-harvesting, the gathering of non-gathering, focusing solely on the work of “bathing,” with a single-minded naturalness. Thereby, spirit and qi unite of themselves, metal and wood merge, and the elixir is obtained. This is what cultivators of the Dao must pay closest attention to.

Below, I set forth its meaning in a diagram:

What has been described above is the meaning of “the fullness of the moon lies in the oral instructions.” Nowadays, those who expound the Dao are beset by too many side doors, so detailed explanation is necessary. Without deep understanding of the principle, one may stray into byways upon encountering them; with thorough knowledge, one can naturally discern them. In former times, the transmission from master to disciple relied entirely on heart-to-heart resonance and mouth-to-mouth instruction. If the master did not dissect it in detail, the disciple had to comprehend it through personal realization—how difficult it was! The subtleties of the principle are not easily clarified without explanation, yet in the past, little was expounded in depth. Even the Seven Perfected, such as Patriarch Qiu, who presided over the teachings, only spoke in broad terms, not in great detail.

The reason I explain it so thoroughly is that the Dao is a thing of great impartiality. My master, Wang, also took universal salvation as his heart, so I carry on his aspiration. Moreover, the Dao cannot be monopolized; having received this Dao, one should take the propagation of the Dao as one’s own responsibility. It is like the universal salvation of Patriarch Lü, which remains unfinished to this day, hence the opening of spirit-writing altars everywhere to spread transformation.

As for attaining the Dao, three thousand eight hundred meritorious deeds are required. Yet with a single-minded sincerity, one may also fulfill the wish—do not be daunted by difficulty. We should take benefiting others as our heart: saving one person is not as good as saving many; saving many is not as good as saving all under heaven. Only by saving all under heaven can one’s heart be somewhat fulfilled.

The upper and lower quarters combine to form the full moon; the moon’s fullness and waning are as described above. In the elixir method, the moon is also compared to the birth of yang: on the eighth day, it is half-round; on the fifteenth, fully round; on the twenty-third, half-round again; by the twenty-eighth, it returns to a crescent. The elixir method uses this to compare the waxing and waning of yang qi. The moon is also likened to the Dao-heart, with nine cycles of work, likewise taking its image from the moon.

Before one hastens to cultivate this Dao, one is like a black moon, utterly without light, akin to the dark of the moon. Through cultivation, worldly passions gradually fade, and a single speck of Dao-heart emerges—this is called the “crescent-moon furnace,” like the moon on the third day, when the first glimmer of Dao-heart appears and the furnace is established. The Pure and True Teaching also draws from the crescent moon, making it the symbol of that faith. On Three Dao Streets in Harbin, the Russians have built a Pure and True mosque, its roof bearing a crescent emblem; in Chinese Pure and True mosques, the crescent is enshrined in the central hall. The crescent moon is likened to the manifestation of the true heart, just as here it is likened to the Dao-heart. The first of the nine cycles is entirely black; the first crescent moon marks the second cycle. By the third cycle, the moonlight increases by one part to two parts, corresponding to the Dao-heart’s manifestation of two parts. In the fourth cycle, the moonlight grows further; the fifth cycle is the upper quarter, half white and half black—this is when the foundation is laid.

All nine cycles pertain to the work of refining nature; by the fifth cycle, the foundation is complete. In the sixth cycle, the moon is mostly bright; by the seventh, the darkness has nearly receded; in the eighth, only a sliver of black remains; the ninth cycle marks success, becoming a luminous full moon. The human heart gradually recedes as the white light grows; by the ninth cycle, the darkness is entirely gone, and the Dao-heart is complete—this is the “nine cauldrons with a single intent” spoken of in the *Xingming Guizhi*.

Why is it called nine? Nine is the number of yang; at the ninth cycle, one returns to pure yang. The nine-cycle elixir method draws from the moon, for by using the moon as a comparison, it is easier to understand. At the time of conception and birth, human beings are originally complete, but as knowledge unfolds and worldly desires cling, they gradually darken. When half dark and half white, it is the day of the five thousand four hundred births of the Yellow Dao. Cultivating at this point requires no laying of foundation; beyond this, the darkness increases, so one must turn black to white.

The waxing and waning of acquired spirit and original spirit, the advance and retreat of yang qi and yin qi—all can be compared to this. By sixty-four years of age, one is nearly entirely dark; when the white light is exhausted and the yang qi is spent, death follows.

The moon itself has no light; its light comes from the sun. The true yang of the prior heaven also comes from without, and only pure *kun* can obtain true yang. The black body is pure *kun*, hence it can absorb the sunlight of yang qi. If the black is slightly mixed with white, it cannot absorb. Thus, when the sun and moon conjoin, the moon absorbs the sunlight only at the dark of the moon, for the white light has receded entirely, forming a purely black body. From this, one can understand the principle of yin-yang interaction: only pure *kun* can interact with pure yang—interaction means absorption.

Upon contact, it immediately responds—thus can it absorb. After absorption, it exhales anew, cycling endlessly. This is the wondrous workings of creation, shared alike by Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Hence it is said, “The moon serves Heaven and Earth as a model for the elixir method,” and this is precisely what is meant.

Within thirty days of a month, the moon passes from darkness to a crescent, to fullness, and back to darkness—exactly thirty days in duration. Thus do calendar-makers fix thirty days as one month.

The moon is the essence of *Taiyin*; its hexagram is *Kun*. The *Kun* hexagram employs six lines. A month’s phases—new moon, full moon, first quarter, last quarter, and dark moon—pass through five stages. Five times six makes thirty, and six lines traversing five stages complete thirty days, forming one cycle. Thus does the *Cantong Qi* say, “The moon’s nodes have five-six, weaving and bearing the sun’s command.”

The moon takes the sun’s light as its own light, completing one cycle in precisely thirty days as it bears the sun’s command. When it exchanges light with the sun, both their conjunction and absorption are by the sun’s command.

Calendar-makers distinguish: the *Taiyin* calendar reckons from the moon, deriving from it; the *Taiyang* calendar reckons from the sun, and is also the Earth’s calendar. Such is their difference.

When the moon reaches the dark of the moon, it lies in the *Kun* direction—the southwest—where a black shadow appears in the *Kun* quadrant. From the moon, one may perceive the workings of Heaven and Earth. *Kun* is fundamentally black, empty, and nothing; when the moon reaches the *Kun* direction, it becomes black, empty, and nothing.

*Kan* and *Li* take over the governance of *Qian* and *Kun*: the sun acts for Heaven, the moon for Earth. *Li* (the sun) acts for *Qian* (Heaven), embodying true yang, eternally undiminished and undispersed—unchanged since the beginning of creation. The moon, however, transforms daily. Here one may discern the creative workings of *Qian*’s strength and *Kun*’s compliance.

Solar and lunar eclipses arise from irregularities in celestial qi; in elixir methods, improper firing times may likewise produce disorders of fire-heat or water-cold. Thus, when Heaven’s movements are improper, disasters arise; when human actions are unharmonious, changes occur—the principle is one and the same.

Only the sun and moon’s eclipses can be predicted in advance; though firing-time disasters cannot be foreknown, they may be detected from subtle signs. All arise from imbalance of yin and yang—there is no difference between the Way of Heaven and the Way of humanity.

In the human element, the firing time requires the balance of two eights. In elixir methods, this is likened to “half a catty and eight taels”—half a catty and eight taels being the same. It is also compared to the waxing and waning crescents: when the body reaches the waxing crescent, the heart reaches the waning crescent. Dividing body and heart into upper and lower crescents, the yin and yang on both sides must be evenly regulated.

At the waxing crescent, advance the yang fire to *mao*; at the waning crescent, retreat the yin tally to *you*. The upper and lower crescents—half a catty and eight taels—unite to form the elixir, that is, the union of yin and yang to complete the Dao. Only when true yin and true yang are evenly balanced can they conjoin; otherwise, they cannot.

This is also called “the union of dragon and tiger.” *Mao* Wood belongs to the Azure Dragon of the East; *you* Metal belongs to the White Tiger of the West. *Mao* and *you* face each other across the Central Palace, thus they unite—this is the union of dragon and tiger. The *Cantong Qi* says, “The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger absorbs the dragon’s essence.” The addition of “calling” and “absorbing” clarifies their relationship—it is the union of upper and lower crescents.

The *Book of Changes* takes *Zhen* as the dragon and *Dui* as the tiger; the union of dragon and tiger is thus the union of *Zhen* and *Dui*. The original heart is *Li*, while the body is *Kan*—this is the union of *Kan* and *Li*.

Because *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* share the same locus, the union of *zi* and *wu* is called the union of *Kan* and *Li*, while the union of *mao* and *you* is called the union of *Zhen* and *Dui*. Their function occurs in the Central Palace. Elixir texts name this “harmonizing the four images and gathering the five phases.” *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* correspond to the four hexagrams *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*.

Yang above and yin below, the union of *Kan* and *Li* is the union of *Zhen* and *Dui*—for *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* converge in the *Kun* Palace and there unite. To clarify this, a diagram is provided as follows: from the beginning straight to the Central Palace is the union of *zi* and *wu*, yet its locus is the gate of *mao* and *you*—thus it may also be called the union of *mao* and *you*. From this, one may understand clearly.

It is also said, “gathering the five phases”—this is the same, with the addition of the Central Palace, which becomes the five phases. *Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* represent Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal; adding the true Earth of the Central Palace completes the five phases.

*Zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* converge in one place: the union of *zi* and *wu* is the union of *mao* and *you*; the union of *mao* and *you* is the pairing of Wood and Metal; the union of *zi* and *wu* is the union of Water and Fire. The distinction lies only in inner and outer—Wood and Metal are outer, *zi* and *wu* inner.

As for the precise division of inner and outer, and the method of their union, these will be detailed when discussing the firing times of the microcosmic orbit.

When cultivating the Dao and practicing the work of returning to emptiness, upon reaching the time when yang arises, one should naturally know the heart-transmission of the timely *zi* and the oral instructions of the full moon. At this point, one may proceed to the work of nine returns and seven reversions.

*Direct Exposition of the Celestial Mechanism, Scroll Four, Lecture Fourteen*

Gradual and sudden methods, the Human and Celestial Origins—
nine layers in sequence, a single intent giving rise to the body.

When cultivating the Dao and practicing the work of returning to emptiness, upon reaching the time when yang arises, one should naturally understand the heart-transmission of the timely *zi* and the oral instructions of the full moon, only then may one apply the work of nine returns and seven reversions. These principles have already been expounded in detail in the previous two lectures.

Now, let us further examine the nine-layered heart-refining practice of Master Li Hanxu, expounding it in full. Through this, the entirety of Daoist cultivation may be broadly grasped.

First, we present Master Li’s original text, followed by a detailed exposition.

His work is titled *The Scripture of Nine-Layered Heart Refinement in the Great Dao of the Human Origin*, also known as *The Nine-Layered Heart-Refining Daoist Discourse*:

**First Layer: Refining the Impure Heart**
This is the refinement of the heart that is not yet pure. The impure heart is filled with delusive thoughts and wandering musings. Delusive thoughts arise from greed and desire, while wandering musings stem from unawareness. When practitioners sit in meditation, though they may wish to cast aside worldly concerns, no sooner have delusive thoughts been dispelled than wandering musings arise anew. The method lies in "cessation and insight," through which these may gradually be dissolved.

To cease is to fix the mind behind the navel hall and before the Gate of Life. Slightly below this, there is a realm of emptiness and nothingness. The heart is stilled here, and inwardly observed. The heart illumines the void, guarding the qi, bound within the compass of the square and circle, moving between their bounds. With each breath, it returns to the root, merging with the natural workings of creation. Immovable and majestic, it establishes the primordial foundation of purity. From this, a single thread of heart-light connects with a wisp of true qi, blending in profound harmony, tranquil and at ease. This is the initial work of refining the heart and nurturing the qi.

The practice of refining the heart in Daoist cultivation is divided into nine stages, each to be discussed separately. It is called the "Great Dao of the Human Origin" because the elixir method distinguishes between the Human Origin and the Celestial Origin. The so-called "Great Elixir of the Celestial Origin" also begins with the Human Origin, for the Human Origin harmonizes with the Celestial Origin. The Celestial Origin pertains entirely to the primordial Dao, culminating in the return to emptiness. The Human Origin, however, begins with later-heaven methods of effort and action. In ancient times, many advanced from the Human Origin to the Celestial Origin, for the Human Origin is the method of laying the foundation and replenishing the root. Those of superior virtue and wisdom may directly cultivate the Celestial Origin, but for duller roots, beginning with the Human Origin is easier. The Celestial Origin is a method of sudden and complete cultivation, while the Human Origin is gradual, as the saying goes: "The Dao perfects the form; the art prolongs life."

Master Li’s nine-layered method was personally transmitted by the Patriarch Lü, and it is a superior and simple practice.

**First Layer: Refining the Impure Heart**
This is the refinement of the self, beginning with the later-heaven body and mind. The later-heaven heart is filled with delusive thoughts and wandering musings. Delusive thoughts are simply thoughts. Wandering musings arise without prior intention, stirring within without purpose, drifting aimlessly, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. Wandering musings arise from nothing, sometimes present and sometimes absent, while thoughts are focused and arise from specific imaginings. Thus, thoughts may be forcibly restrained and overcome, but wandering musings cannot be controlled. For example, poverty giving rise to thoughts of wealth is a delusive thought, born of desire. Wandering musings, however, arise suddenly in the mind regardless of whether one is thinking or not, arriving without cause and thus difficult to prevent beforehand.

The method for refining these two lies in cessation and insight. Cessation is the stilling of thoughts; insight is the observation of the mind. Cessation and insight are practiced in quiescence, in stilling the mind at the utmost good. Fixing the mind of utmost good at the Gate of the Mysterious Female is "dual cultivation of cessation and insight," a term from Buddhism. Daoism calls it "dual cultivation of nature and life" or "dual cultivation of the wondrous aperture."

In Buddhism, the dual cultivation of cessation and insight has many levels. Initially, there is the "Lesser Cessation and Insight," followed by the "Mahayana Cessation and Insight," and finally the "Heavenly and Human Cessation and Insight." The Lesser Cessation and Insight is a gradual method; the Mahayana Cessation and Insight is a method of sudden and complete cultivation; the Heavenly and Human Cessation and Insight pertains to the final return to emptiness, a matter of advanced practice rather than initial work. Here, insight is the observation of emptiness to still thoughts. As stated in the *Lesser Cessation and Insight*: "Cessation is fixing the mind on a condition." That condition is emptiness. One may fix the mind between the eyebrows, or below the navel. Fixing the mind is observing where it is fixed, which is cessation. The empty, thoughtless heart is placed in one of these three locations.

These three locations correspond to three layers. Fixing the mind between the eyebrows aligns with the method of the Tongshanshe. However, fixing the mind between the eyebrows requires withdrawing inward by one *cun*, meaning it remains in the realm of emptiness. Fixing the mind below the navel also requires distancing it from the flesh by one *cun* and three *fen*.

Between the eyebrows is where the light of nature manifests. Thus, the Tathāgata emits the white light of the *ūrṇā* between the eyebrows—this is the luminosity inherent in one’s original nature. The moment when "the empty chamber generates brightness" is when light emanates between the eyebrows, for the space between the eyebrows is the empty chamber.

One *cun* and three *fen* below the navel is the locus of fetal breathing, where the true breath resides. As Liao Chanxuan said: "Before the navel wheel, behind the kidneys, there is a true golden tripod." The golden tripod is the coagulation of the true breath, which practitioners will naturally recognize when the time comes. One *cun* and three *fen* below the navel lies a sphere of true qi, revolving like a wheel—this is the root of life. After birth, the root of life remains here, and as the infant grows, the fetal breath disperses, leaving this place as an empty cavity.

Those who cultivate *xing* (nature) alone begin at the aperture between the eyebrows; those who cultivate *ming* (life) alone begin at the locus below the navel. As Ancestor Lü said: *"To cultivate nature without cultivating life is to remain a yin spirit for ten thousand kalpas, scarcely able to enter sagehood"*—such a one can only become a ghost-immortal of the yin realm. *"To cultivate life without cultivating nature is to share the longevity of heaven and earth as a fool."* (See *The Song of Knocking on the Trigrams*, with slight textual variations.) Thus, one must cultivate both nature and life together. In dual cultivation, one must begin at the "margin’s center."

The *margin* denotes the boundary; the center of this boundary is the empty aperture where inner and outer voids converge—this is the central empty aperture within the microcosm of the human body. As this is the root of respiration and the gateway through which the heart-spirit enters and exits, both spirit and qi gather here. To practice the Dao, one must first unite and interdependently bind the heart-spirit and breath. This is precisely where one should begin.

Now, spirit pertains to nature, while qi pertains to life. Humans rely on qi for life and on spirit for consciousness. These two—spirit and qi—are humanity’s most precious treasures. Qi is acquired from without, stolen from heaven, earth, and the myriad things, yet only through spirit can qi be drawn into the body. Thus, when a person dies and the spirit scatters, qi no longer enters. There are two kinds of death: if the spirit scatters first, the dying person becomes unconscious at the end, exhaling without inhaling, and expires when the breath is fully spent. If the qi is severed first, followed by the scattering of the spirit, the person remains lucid at the moment of death, suddenly ceasing to breathe, and even after death, the eyes may remain clear for some time.

If either spirit or qi departs the body, death is certain. Therefore, one must preserve both spirit and qi to sustain life. Cultivating the Dao is cultivating these two—spirit and qi. Cultivating nature begins with spirit; cultivating life begins with qi. For dual cultivation, one must begin where spirit and qi unite. Neither the space between the eyebrows nor the locus below the navel is appropriate. Only the "margin’s center" aperture, through which spirit and qi enter and exit, is suitable. Beginning dual cultivation from this aperture encompasses all subtle apertures, which is why the Three Teachings all symbolize it with the character *zhong* (center).

Yet this is the *empty* center, not the *true* center. Only when spirit and qi unite and the heart and breath interdependently bind does the true center arise. As Bai Yuchan said: *"Where the thought moves is the Mysterious Female."* Thus, this is called the "margin’s center." The margin’s center is where the true center arises; Daoists call it the "round center" or the "suspended center."

*"Focusing the mind on the margin’s center"* is what Daoists call *"dual cultivation of the subtle aperture,"* Confucians call *"dual cultivation of nature and life,"* and Buddhists call *"dual cultivation of śamatha and vipaśyanā."* The Great Vehicle’s śamatha-vipaśyanā is practiced naturally and effortlessly, proceeding with ease. The lesser śamatha-vipaśyanā is the practice of knowing where to rest. The Great Master Sima of Nanyue specialized in teaching the Great Vehicle’s śamatha-vipaśyanā, which first requires emptying and purifying the heart while nurturing qi. Without śamatha-vipaśyanā, one naturally aligns with it—this is the sudden method. For those of us practicing both sudden and gradual methods, beginning by focusing the mind on the margin’s center is without error. This is the work of the Heavenly Origin.

Li Xian described the initial stage of the Human Origin’s work: *"It lies behind the navel hall and before the Gate of Life. Slightly below these is a circle of emptiness. The mind rests here, and one inwardly observes it."* This is the method of focusing the mind below the navel, a technique for prolonging life through artifice, hence called the Human Origin. The reason it is termed the *"Great Dao of the Human Origin"* and differs from the Heavenly Origin lies in its reliance on intention to generate the subtle aperture.

The method involves first using the qi of postnatal breathing, drawing it deeply inward to gather below the navel, forming this circle of emptiness, and then observing it with the heart. Thus, it is said: *"The heart illumines the void within"* (that is, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel, separated from the flesh). This is the initial practice. When the breath reaches this point, the heart also rests here. With the heart and breath interdependently bound, primordial chaos arises, and creation unfolds.

First cultivating life and then uniting it with nature—nature is bestowed by heaven, while life is established by humans—hence it is called the Human Origin. The method requires first regulating the breath: on the inhalation, direct it with intention to the inner Golden Tripod; on the exhalation, guide it with intention to the outer locus below the navel. Once the primordial qi below the navel is activated, unite the spirit with the breath, ascending to rest at the margin’s center and descending to settle below the navel.

The square pertains to earth; the round pertains to heaven. The round aperture connects with heavenly qi; the square aperture connects with earthly qi. *"Within the square and circle"* is the center between heaven and earth; *"between the compass and square"* is the true Golden Tripod one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Once the primordial qi below the navel is generated and the compass’s center is formed, the true intention moves between inner and outer to maintain it.

Those over sixty-four years of age or in poor health should practice this method to preserve life. The nine layers of heart refinement begin with the Human Origin and ascend to the Heavenly Origin, progressing from the upper-grade elixir method to the supreme vehicle—this is the path. Through the interdependence of heart and breath, the heart unites with the breath, and true breath is established. The former *"circle of emptiness"* congeals into the subtle aperture, which is the prenatal within the postnatal. Then, uniting the two hearts, primordial chaos enters the prenatal.

When cultivation reaches this point, the initial stage of heart refinement is complete.

But this so-called *intention* remains the state between intentional and unintentional—if one forces it excessively, it will instead stir deviant fire and lead to illness. Beware.

The second layer of heart refinement is the refinement of the heart in *ding* (meditative absorption). Previously, a thread of heart-light connected with a wisp of true *qi*; if one could penetrate directly into the profound obscurity, one would naturally break through the subtle aperture. Yet because the stabilized heart is not firm, it is often swayed by the *shen* of discriminating consciousness. Heart and *qi* separate, and one still cannot perceive the original face. The method lies in the moment when heart and breath interdepend: extinguish all awareness, so that the heart abides within *qi* without knowing it, and *qi* envelops the heart without its realizing—vaporous and intermingled, fused into one. This is the work of refining the heart to unite with *qi*. The second layer, refining the heart in *ding*, means the heart is stabilized within *qi*. It remains within the *"circle of emptiness"*—this is stabilization in oneness. With long and thorough practice, one naturally forgets through stabilization, returning to primordial chaos, unaware and unknowing, inwardly forgetting the heart and outwardly forgetting the body, and the subtle aperture naturally emerges.

Zhang Sanfeng said: *"The subtle aperture comes and goes without fixed location."* He also said: *"The entire path of the Yellow Court is the subtle aperture."* The so-called *"path of the Yellow Court"* refers to the domain of breathing. The *qi* of inhalation and exhalation enters and exits through the mouth and nose; wherever the breath can reach is the *"path of the Yellow Court."* Here, based on the location of the *dantian*, we clarify the scope of this *"path"* and illustrate it as follows:

**Scope of the Path of the Yellow Court**
*Upper, Middle, and Lower Fields*
- *External:* Crown, Center (navel), Perineum (Yin Heel)
- *Internal:* Celestial Valley, Responding Valley, Spirit Valley
- *Corresponding Points:* Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, Valley Passage

From the crown to the center is the Upper Field; from the center to the navel is the Middle Field; from the navel to the perineum is the Lower Field. The *dantian* within the body only becomes a *dantian* once the inner elixir is formed—without the elixir, there can be no *dantian*. It is like farmland: what is planted in the field determines its name. If grass is planted, it is grassland; only when wheat is planted does it become wheat field. Only when the elixir is present does it become a *dantian*; without the elixir, there is no *dantian*—only the empty aperture of the *dantian*’s location. In truth, the *dantian*’s location is merely the *"path of the Yellow Court."*

The entire *"path of the Yellow Court"* is the subtle aperture, so the subtle aperture has distinctions of upper and lower, as well as inner and outer. It may appear above or below, with no fixed abode. When it appears above, it is the upper subtle aperture; when below, the lower subtle aperture. Its form is like a ring, its whiteness like snow, its softness like silk. Whether circular (○) or crescent-shaped ( ), these refer to the outer subtle aperture. As for the inner subtle aperture, it is the elixir’s origin—what the Buddha called the ever-turning *Dharmachakra*. When the elixir’s origin first forms, it is the size of a soybean, constantly pulsing within the Lower Field. In moments of deep stillness, one can perceive it.

When we begin practice, the subtle aperture that appears is the outer subtle aperture. The inner subtle aperture can only be seen when the Three Origins merge, the elixir’s origin congeals, and true breath is established. The subtle aperture is the most secret aperture, and it has never been openly explained. Now, for the benefit of later learners, it is explained in detail.

Once the heart is stabilized within the *"circle of emptiness"* below the navel, a thread of luminous heart connects with a wisp of true breath, naturally entering profound obscurity. From this obscurity arises a state of vagueness, and the subtle aperture emerges—this is the manifestation of the outer subtle aperture. However, because the stabilized heart is not firm, the subtle aperture is not easily seen at once. One must first return to emptiness, extinguishing all awareness, so that heart and breath interdepend, spirit and *qi* unite. From stabilization to forgetting, entering primordial chaos, one can then perceive it. This so-called entry into primordial chaos is the work of returning to emptiness.

For us, the work of returning to emptiness is a single direct step, but for others, it involves three stages. The mass of *qi* below the navel is the treasure of life. First, the heart stabilizes and enters it. Second, heart and breath interdepend, spirit and *qi* unite. Third, one gradually enters profound obscurity, returning to the state of emptiness. Though slightly different from our method, after returning to emptiness, the attainment of the medicine is the same.

The third layer of heart refinement is the refinement of the *"returning"* heart. Previously, vaporous and intermingled, fused into one, the return of heavy *yin* is called the heart of Heaven and Earth—this is the subtle aperture. At this moment, essence, *qi*, and spirit all reside in the prenatal. The primordial chaos has just divided, and true essence, true *qi*, and true spirit are not yet distinct. If one can keep the heart utterly unmoving, one may immediately gather and circulate it. Yet, confronted with sights never before seen and sounds never before heard, with wondrous scenes before one, one is at a loss, and the heart stirs, falling into the postnatal—then essence, *qi*, and spirit separate.

The method lies in the moment the subtle aperture first appears: immediately tread upon the fire-cloud, advance to the *weilu* (tailbone), firm the heart, soften the breath, strike the iron drum to pass the Three Passes, and rest at *Kunlun* (the head). This is the work of refining the heart to advance *qi*. The third layer, refining the *"returning"* heart, is the time of the seven-day return, when the first *yang* arises—this is the fire-timing of *yang*’s birth. Beneath heavy *yin*, a single *yang* returns. As true *yang* gradually fills, the subtle aperture appears, and one has reached the state of vagueness. Once the subtle aperture manifests and essence, *qi*, and spirit unite without separation, if there are no stray thoughts, one may gather it.

Upon witnessing what was never seen before and hearing what was never heard before, one may generate a heart of astonishment and joy, or thoughts of doubt and fear—immediately reverting to the postnatal state, where essence, *qi*, and spirit stand divided as three. At this stage of the human element, with deliberate action and effort, the method lies in the moment the subtle aperture first appears: do not cling to any form, but continue the work of settling the spirit externally, with an unmoving heart. After a while, when *yang* *qi* is abundant, gently apply intention to guide it to the *weilu* (tailbone).

The fire-cloud is none other than *yang* *qi*. When the first *yang* arrives at the tailbone, it has reached the body. Why not say "body" but "tailbone"? Because within the *yinqiao* point lies the prenatal true *yang*, of the same kind as the externally incoming true *yang*, thus able to summon and gather the external *yang*. As the external *yang* approaches, it first arrives at the tailbone; internal and external unite, reaching the *mingmen* (Life Gate), and the external kidneys rise—this is the *living midnight*; then it surges to the heart’s palace, and one becomes aware of the external kidneys’ rise—this is the *living noon*. After this awareness, one must immediately apply stillness. From this, the second *yang* and third *yang* follow, and *yang* *qi* fills to abundance, naturally ascending from the tailbone to the *niguan* (mud pill).

At this stage of the human element, fearing attachment to form may give rise to the heart and cause one to miss the opportunity, one first uses subtle intention to guide it upward, breaking through the tailbone to pass the Three Passes, thereby opening the postnatal pathway. In the celestial element, one allows it to proceed naturally; once the subtle aperture opens, all apertures in the body naturally open without exception. Here, the human element employs intention first, differing from the celestial element.

The *living midnight* refers to the arising of *yang*; the *living noon*, to awareness. For those of us with postnatal, broken bodies, *yin* *qi* is abundant, and the initial arrival of *yang* is barely perceptible—only a slight twitching on the skin is felt. In truth, *yang* *qi* has already ascended to the crown. The practice of firming the heart and softening the breath is none other than the work of *ding* (settling) and *wang* (forgetting).

The fourth layer refines the heart of retreat and concealment. Previously, treading the fire-cloud and passing the Three Passes, the heart and *qi* followed, entering the *niguan* (mud pill). Yet within the *niguan* palace, if the consciousness-spirit stirs, *qi* chills and congeals, unable to transform into true water to sprinkle and irrigate the Three Palaces—all prior effort is lost. The method lies in the crown of *Kunlun*: still the heart and master quietude, merging with *qi*; *qi* then transforms into sweet liquid, descending from the upper palate. Curl the tongue to receive the dew, swallow and send it down, directing the heart to the *jiangong* (crimson palace), to the *huangting* (yellow court), to the *yuanhai* (primordial sea)—a resonant sound follows all the way to the base, and the subtle aperture’s manifestation reappears. This is the work of refining the heart to obtain *qi*.

The fourth layer refines the heart of retreat and concealment, corresponding to the sevenfold return within the body. The *yang* of the *yinqiao* draws in external *yang*; as external *yang* arrives, it stirs the *mingmen* and the kidneys rise. I respond with *ding* and *wang* externally; *yang* *qi* then surges upward to the heart’s palace, and I remain aware of the external kidneys’ rise, still applying *ding* and *wang* externally. *Yang* can thus reach the crown—this is the internal path of *yang* *qi*. In the celestial element’s elixir method, one allows natural ascent and descent; what I perceive is only a tingling numbness on the body—initially like fleas jumping, then spreading into a full-body tingling. One must immediately apply the *wang* (forgetting) practice; only then can *yang* *qi* transform into liquid, descending from *Kunlun*, penetrating the heart with cool clarity. At this moment, the heart’s joy is beyond words.

In the human element, with deliberate effort at every step, when *qi* ascends, one quietly abides in the *niguan*, focusing attention for a long while, then guiding it downward, receiving it with the palate and swallowing it past the *chonglou* (throat tower). Again, direct attention to guide it down to the *jiangong*, *huangting*, and back to the *yuanhai*—this is the microcosmic orbit of the sevenfold return. At this point, one should cease the fire; if continued further, the body will grow uncomfortable, and the *qi* will scatter.

The heart and kidneys interact, water and fire mutually aiding; *yang* *qi* ascends, cool liquid descends, with a sound like thunder reaching the base. The ascent is *yang* rising to meet *yin*; the descent is *yin* descending to meet *yang*—this is the work of the microcosmic orbit’s river chariot.

The fifth layer refines the heart of foundation-building. Previously, entering the *niguan* and returning to the *qi* point, the river chariot’s path has been established. Proceeding with a single heart day and night without rest, how could the foundation not be complete within a hundred days? Yet if there is laxity, desire, or intermittent practice, the elixir foundation will not solidify. Foundation-building gathers essence and unites spirit; if effort is not diligent, spirit remains scattered—how can one prolong life?

Those who uphold the Daoist method must practice according to the *zi-wu* (midnight-noon) cycle, daily drawing and adding, extracting *kan* (Water) to fill *li* (Fire), accumulating gold to solidify the abdomen. This is the work of refining the heart to accumulate *qi*.

The fifth layer refines the heart of foundation-building. If the prior work is practiced without negligence, after three hundred microcosmic orbits, the foundation is successfully built. Yet if practice is intermittent, effort not diligent, or the heart unsettled by external distractions, or if the method is not followed correctly, even with great diligence, no gold will accumulate, and progress remains difficult. Foundation-building means establishing and solidifying the elixir foundation. If one is careless and idle, how can daily progress be made and permanence achieved? Thus, the Dao lies in gathering essence and uniting spirit, daily renewing. Those who lack diligence must reform to become diligent; those whose practice is incorrect must correct it to conform to the method.

To achieve one microcosmic orbit is to realize its corresponding effect. Through daily refinement and accumulation, filling the abdomen with gold, the three hundred orbits will naturally be completed with success. In human cultivation, many begin with diligence but end in laxity. By applying corrective effort and self-discipline, one can avoid repeating past mistakes and gradually attain accomplishment. This work of refining the heart and accumulating *qi* is most essential and must not be neglected.

The sixth layer refines the heart of nature. Previously, with the river chariot in motion and the gathering of essence to unite spirit, the numinous root is filled. From this, heart-fluid descends while kidney-*qi* ascends—this is the union of Kan and Li. In profound stillness, a sign arises: vast as the tide, half water-*qi*; misty as fog, half cloud-*qi*. This is called the initial stirring of gold and water, the stage of refining the jade-fluid returning elixir. Yet if the heart is not single-minded, the task of fully realizing nature remains unaccomplished. The method lies in the day when gold and water first arise: from the cinnabar field, they descend to the bubbling spring, instantly converging at the tailbone. Regulating the true breath, one stirs and dances it, causing it to surge upward to the celestial valley, then trickle down to be swallowed into the yellow court. Thus, with daily irrigation, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear, blood transforms into cream, intent congeals into earth, and within earth, mercury is born. Mercury’s nature is round and luminous, unchanging before phenomena—like a spirit-sword in hand. Mencius said, “To fully realize one’s heart is to know one’s nature.” The immortals call this “yin elixir” or “inner elixir.” This is the work of refining the heart to clarify nature.

The sixth layer refines the heart of nature, which is the work of refining the self to generate true intent. In the Heavenly Origin, refining the self is the initial practice. When true intent is achieved, it regulates the firing times, allowing one side to follow nature. In the Human Origin, one first guides *qi* with personal intent—this intent is not true. Only after foundation-building does one undertake this work of refining the self, so that true intent forms and true breath stands firm. This pertains to the work of the character *xing* (nature). Previously, heart and kidneys interacted: kidney-*qi* ascended, heart-fluid descended. The ascending is the true fire within Kan, yang uniting with yin; the descending is the true water within Li, yin uniting with yang. Internally, heart and kidneys unite; externally, gold and water naturally merge, producing a mass of true intent, misty and boundless, circulating through the mysterious pass, gathering without dispersing. The two earths form a jade tablet—this is the external aspect. Internally, heart and kidneys unite, water and fire mutually assist, and after three hundred orbits are completed, a mass of true breath naturally arises—this is the elixir origin, pulsing day and night. From below the navel, it ascends via the heel vessel and returns without cease. Sealed with intent, it rests below the navel, revolving like a wheel. It naturally opens and closes, and the true breath rises and falls, reaching the crown above and the heels below, circulating throughout. At this time, one applies the work of warming and nurturing the elixir origin. Only the two words “stabilize” and “forget” are used: daily, one forgets for a time, stabilizes for a time, and rests for a time. In all six periods, work must be balanced with stabilization and forgetting. After a year of warming and nurturing, the elixir origin transforms into the returning elixir, and externally, a sign appears—a black sphere before the eyes. Still, one stabilizes and forgets, and gradually the black sphere turns red. This is the attainment of the inner elixir and the completion of nature, preparing for the great seven-day orbit of the macrocosm.

The seventh layer refines the already clarified heart. Previously, the river chariot of gold and water was called “inner refinement” by the immortals. Here, there is also the work of external refinement, where external aligns with internal, and the true heart gathers without dispersing. Though the inner body is clarified, mercury’s nature is prone to flight; though inner cultivation is achieved, the yin elixir is easily corrupted. If preservation is impure, the heart-nature may perish again. The method lies in blending the empty and luminous heart with the wondrously existent nature, mixing cinnabar with earth and planting it in the other’s domain. The other’s domain is empty, so I fill it; the other is without, so I provide. Casting the existent into the nonexistent, the solid into the void, the heart dies and does not move. In an instant, the primordial *qi* arrives from the formless. The first hour is one yang, like *Zhen*; the second hour is two yang, like *Dui*. At the second hour, it is time to conjoin the elixir. From the other side, a strand of true *qi* emerges—metaphorically, the tiger born from water; from this side, a speck of mysterious light descends—metaphorically, the dragon emerging from fire. The two, dragon and tiger, meet, and nature and emotion interact in a great battle. Like heaven and earth in darkness, body and heart become still. Suddenly, three yangs stir, like the *Qian* hexagram. Like tide, like fire; like mist, like smoke; like lightning, like thunder; like snow, like blossoms. Within the body, yang *Qian* shines brilliantly. I wield the sword, grasp the seal, step the *gang* and pace the *dou*, stirring the primordial harmony. With fierce firing and extreme refinement, it pierces the three passes and ascends to the mud pill. Every pore in the body opens, unlike the previous jade-fluid river chariot. Swallowing and ingesting it, the primordial controls the acquired, and nature and life unite as one—this is the great return. Nature belongs to fire, its number seven; life belongs to metal, its number nine. Returning to the origin, it is called the seven-return, nine-cycle golden-fluid great elixir. From this, lead comes to restrain mercury, and the heart remains ever luminous, mercury unshaken. This is the work of refining the heart to preserve spirit.

The seventh layer refines the already clarified nature, which is the work of refining *qi* to transform spirit.

Refining the already clarified nature means using one’s own empty numinosity to commune with the heavens’ and earth’s empty numinosity. The heart rests entirely within the void, and thus one must augment forgetfulness and diminish fixation. Forgetfulness is the forgetting of both body and mind. One’s body and mind dissolve into the void, becoming no different from emptiness, and from this emptiness arises creation, revealing the great celestial revolution’s visions. The black orb transforms into a red orb, also called the "crimson tangerine"—this is the moment of "refining the elixir within fire." The red orb circles the body, now rising, now falling, ascending from behind and descending from the front, looping around back and front, divisible into the *zi-wu-mao-you* positions. At these four cardinal points, the orb’s movement must slow slightly; beyond them, it suddenly soars to the highest peak or plunges to the lowest depths, like a fox refining the elixir—others see only the red orb’s rise and fall.

These *zi-wu-mao-you* positions lie entirely outside the body; that realm is the void itself, and one’s true intention fills the void. As for what occurs within the body: *"White clouds gather at the crown, sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru."* The red orb ascends, and hot *qi* rises with it. Soon the red orb descends, and the sweet dew likewise falls, resounding like thunder. After seven days, the red orb transforms into a purple mist enveloping the body. At this time, yin demons surge forth like tides and flames—this is the vision of passing the great celestial revolution, the moment in *Journey to the West* when crossing the Flaming Mountains. During this passage, past karmic deeds manifest, and the ten thousand demons converge. All one’s greed, anger, delusion, and attachment, along with karmic burdens from past lives, appear before the eyes; every person ever glimpsed likewise emerges in vision.

The "grasping the sword and wielding the seal" refers to the sword of wisdom, which is the true awakened heart—one must use this true heart to subdue all, wielding it like a sword to sever everything. The seal is the celestial seal, the heart of heaven. When yin demons surge like tides, the slightest movement of the heart topples the elixir crucible. Thus one must grasp the sword and wield the seal to subdue all, resting the heart in boundless emptiness without allowing a single thought to arise.

The *gang* are the four cardinal directions—*zi, wu, mao, you*; the *dou* is the Dipper’s handle, the fixed pivot. "At this time, one must stir the primordial harmony with fierce firing and extreme refinement"—this is the crossing of the Flaming Mountains in *Journey to the West*. The mountain spans eight hundred *li*, with no path through, and within it gather ten thousand demons, flames raging like a furnace. Only after passing this trial does one attain peace: every pore in the body opens like popping beans, both itchy and hot, leaving one as if drunk or dazed, blood and *qi* reversing their flow throughout the body. After a while, a cool fluid descends, and the whole body becomes refreshed.

The reason one must use the Plantain Fan to cross the Flaming Mountains is that the plantain is a leaf of wood, soft though wooden in nature, likened to the fluid of wood. Fanning generates wind, and wind is the true yin *qi*. This *qi* reaches the mouth and transforms into a most refreshing liquid, though before reaching the mouth, it remains gaseous. Three times the Plantain Fan is wielded to fan the wind and extinguish the fire—three represents *qian*, metal; the plantain is wood, thus metal and wood unite.

When Sun Wukong meets Princess Iron Fan, their tender words symbolize the meeting of true yin and true yang, their harmonious union. The fire of the Flaming Mountains is the fire of the discriminating mind; the Bull Demon King is the great white ox of Snow Mountain, representing *kun* earth, the earth of intention. Intention harbors many delusions—dispelling delusion reveals truth. Intention is inherently continuous, hence "beheading it only causes another head to grow." Only the Bull Demon King embodies delusive intention, and its fire must be quelled with yin softness, extinguishing delusion to return to truth—this is the illumination of the heart and seeing of nature. The Bull King’s submission to righteousness relies on the encirclement of vajra warriors, symbolizing the body pervaded by *qian* metal.

The seven emotions and six desires of human life are all delusive intentions; at this time, truth and delusion wage war, yin and yang clash. Having passed the great celestial revolution, delusion reverts to truth, turbid yin is exhausted, and true yang returns to the body, forming a purely yang physique. Thus it is called the "seven-return, nine-cycle golden-fluid great return elixir," distinct from the lesser celestial revolution’s jade-fluid return elixir. The lesser revolution is the seven-return; the greater revolution is the nine-cycle. If referring to either alone, both lesser and greater revolutions involve seven-return and nine-cycle.

After passing the great celestial revolution, the heart remains unmoving, merging with the great void—henceforth begins the work of spirit departure. The eighth layer refines the heart, having already subdued it, to enable communion with the spirit. Prior to this, the seven-return and nine-cycle used lead to restrain mercury, and the heart was settled. Yet it must be warmed and nurtured, so that the body’s *qi* fully transforms into spirit, and the body’s spirit can roam beyond.

Thus, taking the twelve months of the year’s qi and climate, excluding the third and ninth months for bathing, the remaining ten months are for advancing and retreating—hence the name "ten-month nurturing." This does not mean ten months of effort are required; otherwise, though the heart may be settled, it will not be numinous. Refine and forge it, and the numinous heart will manifest day by day. When numinous, it moves; when it moves, it transforms; when it transforms, it transcends—thus the work of spirit departure arises, and one is no longer deluded by worldly emotions. This is the practice of refining the heart into spirit.

The eighth layer refines the already subdued heart to enable communion with the spirit—this is precisely the work of spirit departure. After obtaining the external elixir, one must employ the nurturing practice, which takes approximately one year. Excluding the third and ninth months for bathing, ten months remain—this is the "ten-month gestation." The method involves connecting the void within one’s body to the void of heaven and earth. Over time, the purple radiance enveloping the body transforms into golden light, which gradually expands to the size of a chariot wheel, covering the crown of the head—this is the vision of spirit departure. At this stage, one is often unaware, for the mind is lost in forgetfulness, neither knowing nor perceiving. It is fitting to have a companion to guard, protect, and rouse one, so that upon awakening, the spirit departs at once.

Initially, the spirit is immature and cannot travel far, stopping after five or ten paces. With gradual refinement, it travels farther, eventually reaching thousands or tens of thousands of miles. At this point, one looks back upon the physical body as dung and dirt, and many at this stage achieve liberation through the corpse, dissolving away. Moreover, from this point onward, the refinement of spirit into void is a matter of the spirit alone—even without the physical body, cultivation remains possible, so there is no harm in relinquishing it. Yet even if relinquished, the physical body may endure for a long time without decay.

The ninth layer refines the already numinous heart to return it to emptiness. Through deep nurturing, the spirit has departed without confusion, following the heart’s desires without hindrance, treading upon clouds and mist, roaming the islands of the sea—what joy is this! But if the numinous heart is not empty, it cannot contain the ten thousand existences; thus, there is the practice of refining emptiness. In refining emptiness, the heart and breast are vast and boundless, all existences become nothing, and a single qi of pure emptiness spirals between heaven and earth—this is I, yet not I; this is emptiness, yet not emptiness. When the world is destroyed, only emptiness remains undestroyed; when heaven and earth are obstructed, only emptiness is unobstructed. Thus, the spirit fills the void, and the Dharma pervades the realms of sand. This is the beginning and end of heart refinement—nothing surpasses it.

The ninth layer refines the already numinous heart to return to emptiness. The numinous spirit must be swept clean, shattered into emptiness, becoming a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million emanation bodies—then the transformations of spiritual power are boundless. At this stage, the spirit has shed its womb, so it may return to emptiness as spirit alone, or return to emptiness while retaining the physical form. Everywhere in the void is where my spirit arrives; everywhere in the void is my Dharma body. Thus, the ninth layer of heart refinement is accomplished.

This chapter begins with the initial steps and concludes with the return to emptiness, for it first addresses the work of connecting life, which differs slightly in practice. After entering the great celestial revolution, it is no different from the primordial Dao now discussed. The Human-Origin Elixir method takes one’s intention as primary, embodying the meaning of "intent generating the body." The method lies in unifying intention to reach sincerity. However, if one’s cultivation is not yet mature, the firing times may not be easily mastered, and its simplicity does not compare to the Heavenly Origin. The ancients said that only those of the highest capacity can cultivate the Heavenly Origin; those of middling endowment must progress from the Human Origin to the Heavenly Origin.

**Fifteenth Lecture: The Governing Vessel lies behind, the Conception Vessel lies before.**

When the work of returning to emptiness reaches the moment when yang arises in the body, one may proceed to the practice of the Microcosmic Orbit. The initial arising of yang is the *living zi hour*; our awareness of yang’s arising is the *living wu hour*. Within the Microcosmic Orbit, there are seven internal returns and nine external reversions: internally, water and fire intermingle; externally, metal and wood unite. The alchemical texts caution against attachment to the physical form—this is a necessary mindfulness in our practice, though in truth the work is performed upon the body. If the firing times are appropriate, then internally, Kan and Li merge, achieving the harmony of water and fire; externally, Zhen and Dui unite, achieving the fusion of metal and wood. The harmony of water and fire is the union of heart and kidney, though the alchemical texts avoid the term “union of heart and kidney” to prevent attachment to the body. In reality, even when called the union of heart and kidney, it does not refer to the physical form but to the intermingling of true yang and true yin in the postnatal state. Externally, it is the union of true yang and true yin in emptiness—this is the Reverted Elixir of Jade Liquid. Though the Microcosmic Orbit has the image of the River Chariot, one cannot clearly perceive it due to the heaviness of yin in our bodies; in the Macrocosmic Orbit, the River Chariot becomes perceptible.

The path of the River Chariot is none other than the Governing and Conception Vessels: the Governing Vessel lies behind, the Conception Vessel lies before, with the Governing Vessel as yang and the Conception Vessel as yin. Since ancient times, few have been willing to explain these two vessels in detail; here, I shall expound upon them thoroughly:

The Great Ultimate gives rise to Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth are one Great Ultimate; likewise, each human body also contains a Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate has three points of intersection, and the human body also has three points of intersection; from these three points arise the three barriers. The three points of intersection in our bodies are the three points where the Governing and Conception Vessels meet.

The Governing Vessel runs along the back of the body, the Conception Vessel along the front, and between them lies a vertical vessel called the *Chong* (Thoroughfare Vessel) and a horizontal vessel called the *Dai* (Belt Vessel). Both the Chong and Dai Vessels connect with the Governing and Conception Vessels, serving as their subsidiary channels. Here, I illustrate this with a diagram:

From conception to birth, I have already roughly explained once. Now, I shall discuss the Governing and Conception Vessels again: after the union of male and female essence, yang revives on the seventh day, and the primordial embryo is established. After another forty-nine days, the Governing Vessel first forms, originating at the *weilu* (coccyx). The *weilu* lies behind the anus, where the tailbone is. Slightly above the *weilu*, two white points appear—these are the two kidneys of the *mingmen* (Gate of Life). The vessel extends straight up to the head, reaching its end at two openings—the nostrils. Slightly above these, two black points form—the eyes. This is the Governing Vessel, the master of the body’s formation. After some days, the Conception Vessel forms along the front of the body, connecting internally from the upper and lower lips of the mouth to the Governing Vessel, descending to the *yinqiao* point in the lower region, where it again meets the Governing Vessel.

The upper portion of the Governing Vessel enters internally from the upper lip, curves around the ears to the spine, intersecting with it; slightly below, it turns inward to the *chonglou* (throat), reaching the lower lip to connect with the upper end of the Conception Vessel. The lower portion of the Governing Vessel branches off at the anus, surging into the abdomen to reach the navel—this is the Belt Vessel. From the anus, it descends straight to the *yinqiao* orifice, where it meets the Conception and Thoroughfare Vessels. The Thoroughfare Vessel rises from the *yinqiao* straight up to the *chonglou*; thus, the *yinqiao* orifice is a three-way intersection, for the Conception, Governing, and Thoroughfare Vessels all converge here.

The middle portion of the Governing Vessel extends from the spine’s great bone, branching into two vessels that reach the backs of the hands, and from the spine’s great bone, two vessels enter the backs of the feet. The Conception Vessel is similar, branching from the front to the palms of the hands and from the front to the soles of the feet. These Governing and Conception Vessels contain no blood vessels; they are the pathways for the opening and closing of prenatal true breath. In the postnatal state, they become obstructed and impassable.

Humans possess eight vessels: the Conception, Governing, Thoroughfare, and Belt Vessels, as well as the Yang Linking, Yin Linking, Yang Heel, and Yin Heel Vessels. The qi of the Orbit ascends from the *weilu* and *yinqiao* to the upper body, then turns into the hands and feet, circulating through the Governing and Conception Vessels—thus, the arising of yang is first sensed in the hands and feet. As the *Book of Changes* states: *“The yellow center penetrates the pattern, beauty resides within, and flows into the four limbs.”* This is precisely the case.

The Great Ultimate has three points of intersection—upper, middle, and lower—and the Governing and Conception Vessels also have three points of intersection. The upper intersection at the back is where the spine’s great bone crosses in a cross shape; at the front, it is where the upper and lower lips meet at the center of yin and yang. The lower intersection is the cross-shaped meeting at the *yinqiao*—all connected by the Belt Vessel.

At birth, humans first develop the eight vessels, then the viscera, and finally the bones and flesh; the eight vessels and nine meridians all encircle and support the Central Palace. In the postnatal state, the Governing and Conception Vessels become obstructed and impassable, and we rely on the nine reversions and seven returns to open them. Opening these two vessels is thus called “unlocking the barriers and expanding the orifices.”

The Governing Vessel is the path of yang’s ascent, the Conception Vessel the path of yin’s descent; through the Governing and Conception Vessels, the Orbit is circulated—this is essential for the Macrocosmic Orbit. In the Microcosmic Orbit, however, the ascent occurs via the Thoroughfare Vessel, and one need not rely on the Governing and Conception Vessels to circulate it.

The Governing Vessel pertains to the body, the Conception Vessel to the heart—thus the terms “body” and “heart” arise. In the postnatal state, the Governing Vessel is obstructed and impassable; what substitutes for it in performing its function is the spine.

The spine courses through the entire body, thus the function of the Governing Vessel remains. The Microcosmic Orbit operates through the "midnight-noon ebb and flow," extracting lead to replenish mercury. Lead is the yang within Kan (Water), while mercury is the yin within Li (Fire); extracting and replenishing is termed "midnight-noon ebb and flow." The pathway it traverses is the Thoroughfare Vessel, which courses through midnight and noon. When external yang arises at the Yin Heel Vessel, it stimulates the Gate of Life, causing the external kidneys to ascend. As it ascends via the Thoroughfare Vessel, it arouses awareness, thus activating the noon hour. Once the yang has ascended and can be stabilized through forgetting, a cool fluid descends to the Gate of Life, and the yang retracts. The circulation of yang qi is entirely conducted by the Thoroughfare Vessel, for at this time, true breath has yet to be established, the Conception and Governing Vessels remain obstructed, and the pathways of ascent and descent are naturally unknown.

Midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk are the four cardinal palaces, corresponding to the nine reversions and seven returns, eight returns and six residences: the nine reversions occur at midnight, the seven returns at noon, the eight returns at dawn, and the six residences at dusk. Why is "six residences" placed at dusk? Because of the metal within water. The nine reversions return the yang of the ninefold celestial number; the seven returns revert the yin of the sevenfold celestial number—returning the celestial nine’s yang and reverting the celestial seven’s yin. The eight returns signify emotions returning to nature, where nature is the celestial three and terrestrial eight of the eastern direction. Six represents water; terrestrial six is water, which is born in the ninth earthly branch (Shen) and bathed in the tenth (You)—hence "six residences." In the postnatal state, Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth) transform into Kan (Water) and Li (Fire); the true emotions within Kun ascend to become Li. Now, true emotions return to their original position in Kun—thus the terms "eight returns" and "six residences." Nine and seven, eight and six—these are precisely metal and wood conjoined, water and fire intermingled. Six (water) and nine (metal) make fifteen; eight (wood) and seven (fire) make fifteen—hence the terms "metal within water" and "wood within fire."

In the diagram above, midnight, noon, dawn, and dusk may be added: dawn and dusk lie within the circle of the Girdle Vessel, midnight at the Yin Heel Vessel, and noon at the crown—this is what is meant by "within the cavity." When the work of the Microcosmic Orbit reaches the state of forgetting through stabilization, one enters a profound obscurity, becoming a formless, utterly Kun-like body. From this formless void, yang is born. When yang arises in the emptiness before reaching the body, one remains in a state of undifferentiated obscurity. Upon sensing it in the body, one transitions from profound obscurity to a state of vague perception—externally, there are signs; internally, there are visions. Suddenly, a white light appears, and when this white light reaches the body, this is an external sign. Yang first arrives at the four limbs, producing a keen sensation—one feels a tingling numbness in the limbs, another external sign. At this moment, one must stabilize externally, which is termed "congealing the spirit within the qi cavity." As the saying goes: *"To become a Buddha or an immortal requires no effort—only congeal the spirit within the qi cavity."*

At this time, one senses within the mysterious emptiness a mass of misty, swirling qi gently coalescing. The heart now perceives that yang has arisen, for this awareness arises from the stirring of yang qi. If the spirit lingers within the body, the yang qi will dissipate; thus, one must stabilize within the void, congealing the spirit into the misty qi. At this point, heart and breath are interdependent, yet one must still congeal the spirit, for the spirit has been aroused to awareness, and there is a risk of its dispersion. Therefore, one must congeal the spirit into the qi, stabilizing it within the mysterious aperture—one cannot be negligent. A slight, subtle intention must still be employed, hence the term "martial fire," referring to the use of this subtle intention. Since the yang is newly born, without martial fire, there is a risk that awareness will cause the spirit to scatter, or that arising thoughts will cool the fire. Thus, one must employ a subtle intention, using martial fire for intense refinement—this is the explanation from the perspective of practice. From the perspective of obtaining the medicine, it is a matter of fire driving metal to move; only by driving it with fire does the metal ascend—this is achieved by fixing true intention within the aperture.

As yang qi grows increasingly abundant, one feels a tingling numbness throughout the body; the eighty-four thousand pores all sense the arising of yang. The eighty-four thousand hairs of Sun Wukong can all transform because yang has reached the pores. When the entire body tingles, the alchemical texts speak of the "steaming fire phase": initially, it reaches the body but does not enter within. Once the tingling is felt, it has entered within, and a method is needed to retain it in the body—this lies in forgetting. If one cannot forget the body and instead attends to it, the yang will depart. Only by forgetting can it be retained—this is of utmost importance. By retaining the yang qi and accumulating it daily, yin qi naturally recedes. When half of it has receded, the spirit enters the qi cavity and naturally stabilizes in the most perfect place. If yang is sufficiently abundant, one can naturally stabilize and forget the body—this is the transition from effort to ease.

Once the practice reaches the state of effortless stabilization and forgetting, the awareness becomes spiritual awareness, distinct from the previous use of the acquired spirit. Formerly, the acquired spirit was in control, necessitating forgetting; now, the acquired spirit has receded, and the original spirit is numinous, naturally able to stabilize and forget. There is no need to cease the fire—simply forgetting serves to cease it. When employing subtle intention, stabilization is martial fire, and forgetting is civil fire; cessation of practice is the cessation of fire. Upon reaching the state of ease, the fire phase may shift: stabilization becomes civil fire, and forgetting becomes the cessation of fire. Intentional stabilization is martial fire; natural stabilization is civil fire; forgetting both body and heart is the cessation of fire—these are the distinctions.

At this point, one may continue the work. During the phase of effort, cessation of practice serves to cease the fire.

When in a state of naturalness, forgetting serves to cease the fire. Day by day, one abides in primordial chaos; day by day, yang is born. Only when it is full and sufficient can this state be attained. At this point, stabilization becomes the act of gathering, and forgetting becomes sealing and securing—unlike the earlier stage, when stabilization was for refinement and forgetting for gathering, while cessation of practice was for sealing.

As Lü Zu said: *"Do not idly guard the furnace and watch the fire—simply settle the spirit and rest in naturalness."* This is the state of ease and spontaneity. Here, yang naturally becomes full and sufficient; there is no need for refinement—merely stabilization to gather and forgetting to seal will suffice. Only at this stage can true reversion and restoration occur. When the original spirit is numinous and capable of awareness, the small celestial cycle begins to take effect.

Previously, during the phase of effort, yang would rise and be perceived, and upon perception, one would stabilize. Yet this single act of perception already introduced impurities, falling into the postnatal and lacking purity—it was not the unadulterated prenatal. Only when one reaches the state of self-stabilization and self-forgetting does it become purely prenatal, allowing for the extraction of one *kan* to fill *li*. During the phase of postnatal admixture, though gathering occurs, it is not pure and thus lacks efficacy. Only when spiritual awareness is complete and gathering is thorough—after three hundred celestial cycles—does the foundation-laying effect manifest.

In the earlier phase of effort, the awareness of yang’s arising was accompanied by intention; it could not be the purest source of water, for it was slightly entangled with the forms of body and heart. This could supplement the postnatal but not enter the prenatal; it could nourish the body but not form the elixir. When yang arose and was perceived, and then gradually receded after perception, this was all due to the acquired spirit’s activity. Only when awareness arises from the spirit, and sealing is also from the spirit—all occurring naturally—does it belong to the prenatal.

Upon attaining spiritual awareness, a tingling numbness signals yang’s arising, though initially unnoticed. Once arisen, it reaches the lively *wu* hour; stabilization and forgetting remain external, and yang naturally recedes. When the practice becomes deeply familiar, cool fluid descends, penetrating the heart with a refreshing chill—like emerging from a bath, the body is utterly at ease. This marks the completion of one celestial cycle. Because daily immersion in primordial chaos has accumulated sufficient yang, when yang arrives, it stirs the yin heel vessel and harmonizes with the original *qi*. The Gate of Life is the inner kidney, connected to the outer kidney; when yang reaches the Gate of Life, the outer kidney rises.

Simultaneously, yang *qi* ascends through the thoroughfare vessel into the crown, stirring awareness. Awareness is the spirit. Once yang’s arising is spiritually perceived, stabilization and forgetting remain external as one enters the *qi* cavity. After a short while, the yang organ retracts, and the wooden fluid descends—this fluid, transformed from *qi*, flows from the crown down to the elixir field. This cool fluid is most precious, suffusing the body with refreshing coolness and filling the heart with indescribable joy. Where once there was chaos, now there is clarity.

In this phase, the fire and spiritual awareness harmonize naturally. The pores first tingle with numbness, then ease; as the cool fluid descends, the itching ceases—here, one celestial cycle is complete. The numinous fluid atop the crown is true yin, also called jade fluid. When outer yang and inner yang converge and surge upward, inner yang is the yang within *kan*—the true fire of the Gate of Life. *Kan* is water, yet it conceals true fire. Surging upward to the *li* palace—*li* is fire, yet it conceals true water. Fire comes to meet water, and the true water within *li* descends. The outer kidney rises with the ascent of fire and retracts with the descent of water. True water flows into the Gate of Life—water comes to meet fire, both being the intermingling of water and fire.

The true fire within *kan* ascends—this is extracting *kan* to fill *li*. The true water within *li* descends—this is returning *li* to *kan*. *Kan* and *li* intermingle, restoring the body of *qian* and *kun*. The Gate of Life, the inner kidney, conceals true fire and governs the body, thus being the body’s yang. Awareness resides in the brain as the heart; the heart conceals true water and is yin. Thus, in the comparison of the physical form, the intermingling of water and fire is the intermingling of the *qi* of heart and kidney. This is the natural lively *zi* hour and lively *wu* hour—the natural union. With prolonged practice, one can reverse aging: white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow.

This internal union is also called the union of *kan* and *li*, dragon and tiger. There is also an external union—the union of *qian* and *kun*, *zi* and *wu*. At the lively *zi* hour, external yang arrives at the mysterious cavity of the central palace, which connects to the yin of respiration. Once it reaches the mysterious cavity, it swiftly communicates within. As the *qi* of the Gate of Life surges into the heart, it becomes the lively *wu* hour; spiritual awareness naturally emerges from stabilization within the mysterious cavity, piercing through primordial chaos to reveal light.

The spirit of spiritual awareness emerges and, upon condensation, enters the *qi* cavity to unite with the incoming external yang—this is the union of metal and wood. The union occurs within the mysterious cavity. Yin is originally wood mercury, concealed within *li*, while the incoming *qi* is lead—lead being metal. This is the union of *qian* and *kun*, *zi* and *wu*. The phenomena within the body include only tingling numbness and the movement of the yang organ. The descent of yin and ascent of yang go unnoticed; only the movement of the yang organ is perceived. The descending cool fluid, originally transformed from true *qi*, becomes seminal essence through the union of spirit and *qi*—this is the prenatal within the postnatal. The entire body tingles with numbness, itching permeating every pore—this completes one celestial cycle. At this point, one celestial cycle is concluded.

The union of *qian* and *kun*, *zi* and *wu*, is the ninefold return—returning the yang of emptiness. The union of *kan* and *li*, dragon and tiger, is the sevenfold reversion—retreating the yin within the body. The ninefold return advances yang; the sevenfold reversion retreats yin—these are their distinctions.

When the natural spiritual awareness arises, it is the primal spirit taking charge—only then does it accord with the method. During forced practice, though yang may rise, it cannot unite, for the water source is not clear, and the body cannot be pervaded by tingling softness. Only when the water source is utterly pure does it avail the work. In sleep, when utmost stillness is reached, stillness gives rise to yang; though the water source is inherently clear, if spirit and *qi* do not unite, yang may rise yet remain unperceived. If yang rises in sleep and one awakens, waking is itself awareness. But once this awareness occurs, should worldly desires or stray thoughts intrude, the water source becomes impure, and the elixir cannot form.

Formerly, the Ming Prince Ji received the Dao from his master, then met Master Wu again. Wu asked, “What method did your previous master teach you?” Prince Ji replied, “He instructed me to wait until sleep, then upon waking to yang’s rise, to apply effort in gathering and refining. Yet after long practice, I saw no effect—why?” Wu told him, “When you wake and become aware of yang’s rise, then rise to sit in meditation, you have already attached to the form of the body. This impure water source—how can the elixir form?” From this, we know the water source must be clear. Without first completing the work of returning to emptiness, achieving stillness of body and mind, yang cannot arise. When yang does arise, it requires various firing times for the water source to remain clear and unmuddied.

The alchemical texts’ “striking bamboo to summon the turtle” refers to the living *zi* hour; “playing the zither to beckon the phoenix” refers to the living *wu* hour. When yang arises in sleep, if natural spiritual awareness is reached and the primal spirit is alert, the work is already complete without waking, and one celestial cycle is accomplished. There is also the martial fire of the water clock, where the clock’s marking is the counting of breaths. But the counting must be done by listening with the ear—not by mentally noting the number, but by the breath naturally reaching the ear so it may be heard.

Exoteric and heterodox schools misconstrue the firing times, giving rise to endless complications. Thus, they speak of counting breaths or prolonging them, unaware that there exists a natural, true firing time that requires no kindling herbs or burning rushes. When one reaches a state of effortless spontaneity, the primal spirit acts on its own, without need for deliberate exertion.

At the outset of practice, from yang’s rise to its retraction may take, for example, a quarter-hour. Gradually, this shortens—from a quarter-hour to ten minutes, then five, and at its swiftest, to one minute. From *zi* to *hai*, a single cycle takes but a minute—this is the stage of mastery. Continuing without interruption, it is said, “The free-flowing river chariot turns hundreds of times.” Each movement and stillness follows in unbroken succession. After three hundred cycles, the minor celestial orbit is complete, and the elixir foundation is laid.

The elixir foundation lies one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. At first, it pulses up and down—descending to the Gate of Life, ascending to the Heart Palace. The eyes should be fixed upon this point one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel to seal and stabilize it. As the *Yinfu Jing* says, “The mechanism lies in the eyes”—this is precisely it. The *Xingming Guizhi* states, “Heart and kidneys are separated by eight *cun* and four *fen*, hollow as a lotus root yet interconnected”—this is the same principle. Focusing here for three to five days, the pulsation at one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel forms a circle. True breathing is established, naturally opening and closing.

When the sevenfold reversion and ninefold return reach one cycle per minute, continue for three hundred celestial orbits—then the minor orbit is complete, and one may return to the body of youthful purity, the foundation successfully laid. The martial fire of the water clock is the work of regulating breath and restraining thoughts. Fearing that yang’s rise may attach to the forms of body and mind, one listens to the breath with the ear and silently counts, binding body and mind to prevent dissipation. This is the same as the breath regulation at the outset, as previously explained.

The Buddhist “Six-Syllable True Words” and the Daoist “Six-Syllable Formula” share this intent. The Daoist six syllables for breath regulation are: *chui*, *he*, *xu*, *xi*, *hu*, *xi*. *Chui* treats kidney meridian illnesses; *he* treats heart meridian illnesses; *xu* treats liver meridian illnesses; *xi* treats lung meridian illnesses; *hu* treats spleen meridian illnesses; *xi* treats triple burner illnesses. Each syllable directs *qi* to its respective meridian, allowing *qi* to reach the organs, balancing it and curing disease. The Buddhist six syllables are the same; both Daoist and Buddhist six-syllable formulas can treat illness.

The *Damo Chan Jing* lists four phases: panting, blowing, *qi*, and breathing. In regulating breath, one must pass through these four states. Panting is uneven exhalation; blowing is forceful breath, coarse *qi*—like snoring in sleep. With prolonged practice, one can regulate the *qi*. *Qi* refers to the harmonized postnatal breath; when true breathing is achieved and abides below the navel, this is called obtaining true breathing.

There are also distinctions between sharp and dull roots. Sharp roots refer to those with deep foundations and past wisdom; dull roots are the opposite. During practice, there are phenomena and images. Dull roots do not perceive forms until reaching true form; sharp roots see many forms, but these are illusory. The first phenomenon one should perceive in practice is the primordial chaos of the Supreme Ultimate and the Two Modes. It is present at all times—when spirit and *qi* unite, it appears. Sharp roots perceive it often; dull roots see it rarely, or not at all.

Bodily sensations are phenomena; what appears before the eyes are images. Alchemical texts say, “Each step has its phenomena, each step has its images.” Most alchemical texts rely on images for explanation, making them difficult to understand.

The *Heart-Transmitted Rhymed Verses* speak of the primordial Great Dao, recording only the words of verified cultivation—never discussing dharmic phenomena. Yet in its dialogues, it often touches upon such phenomena, where the terms "that" (*bi*) and "self" (*wo*) most frequently lead to error. "That" is spoken in relation to others, and many mistakenly take it to mean a woman—how could they know that "that" is no person at all, but rather refers to empty space? Since there is no way to describe the forms one perceives, the word "that" is used as a substitute. For example, when awareness arises and the perceiver sees before them a "self," it is called "that"—the one who perceives is "that," not the "self."

The phrases *"An echo resounds in the empty valley; a shadow appears when the pole is raised"* are often used in alchemical texts. Where there is an aperture, sound arises—emptiness gives birth to the music of heaven. Thus, every empty valley can transmit sound. The sword is wisdom-light; with this wisdom-sword, one slays all manner of demons and ghosts. As the *Awakening to Reality* says, *"A flash of lightning slays demons a thousand miles away"*—this is precisely it. Nine is yang; wisdom-light is the light within the formless. The stringless lute means it speaks without being played.

**Lecture Sixteen: The True Water and True Fire’s Sevenfold Internal Union**

**The External Union of Metal and Wood, Zi and Wu: The Ninefold Return**

The Ninefold Return and Sevenfold Reversal of the Minor Celestial Cycle have already been explained: internally, Kan and Li unite in the north and south; externally, Qian and Kun unite at Zi and Wu. The union of Kan and Li in the north and south occurs as the internal exchange between heart and kidneys; the union of Qian and Kun at Zi and Wu occurs as the external exchange between spirit and qi. When true yang stirs within the body and the external kidneys rise, this is the *living Zi hour*; when the true fire of the Gate of Life surges upward to the crown and is perceived, this is the *living Wu hour*. At this moment, both internal and external unions have already taken place. True yang emerges from the void, and the void lies beyond the body—hence it is called "external."

The union of Qian and Kun at Zi and Wu constitutes the Ninefold Return, while the union of Kan and Li in the north and south constitutes the Sevenfold Reversal. In truth, the union of Qian and Kun at Zi and Wu is also the union of Mao and You—this is the conjunction of Metal and Wood. The Mysterious Aperture is the gateway of Mao; Mao is the true void within me, the lesser void. You is the greater void, indescribable in form, thus provisionally named "that." Yet "that" is truly the "I" of "I."

From the womb, one receives one’s nature, and nature arises from the void. "That" is the master of the void, and the void is the master of me—thus it is said, *"That is truly the I of I."* Here, a diagram may clarify: the lesser void connects to the greater void, and qi emerges from within the void. Therefore, "that" of the void is the master of me. Moreover, in the postnatal realm, the colored body is taken as the self—this self is the consciousness-spirit. Combined with "that," it becomes the true self. The consciousness-spirit that governs the colored body is merely the provisional self.

The union of Zi and Wu is also the union of Mao and You. Mao pertains to Wood, the spirit of Wood-Mercury, its color red—also called *Red Mercury*. You pertains to Metal, the true yang of Lead, its color white—also called *White Lead*. When the living Zi hour arrives, true yang reaches the body, the external kidneys rise, and my true perceiving spirit of Mercury emerges to unite within the Mysterious Aperture, drawing in the true yang of Lead to merge with it—thus it is said, *"Lead arrives, Mercury welcomes."* The spirit-awareness of Mercury naturally greets the true yang of Lead—this is the union of Mao and You, the external exchange.

Internally, when yang stirs and surges to the crown, this is the union of Wu and Zi. The welcoming of Lead is the work of spirit-awareness, not the consciousness-spirit. If the consciousness-spirit is employed, it remains postnatal and cannot generate transformation. The phrase *"With intent, one welcomes; with intent, one sends"* refers precisely to spirit-awareness, not the intent of the consciousness-spirit.

Externally, Mao unites with You; internally, Wu unites with Zi. Once both exchanges are complete, the congealed fluid descends to the Gate of Life, the external kidneys retract—this is Zi arriving to unite with Wu, the internal exchange. Externally, the spirit of Wood-Mercury stabilizes within the Mysterious Aperture, and true Lead once more arrives to unite with it—this is You uniting with Mao. Initially, Mercury emerges to welcome Lead; subsequently, Lead arrives to unite with Mercury—both exchanges occur within the external Mysterious Aperture, constituting the union of Mao and You.

Internally, Wu first unites with Zi, fire coming to unite with water; then Zi unites with Wu, water coming to unite with fire—this is the internal union of water and fire, the exchange between heart and kidneys. One internal, one external, both unions occur simultaneously—thus it is said, *"Internally, Kan and Li unite in the north and south; externally, Qian and Kun unite at Zi and Wu."* The union of Zi and Wu is the union of Mao and You.

The internal union of water and fire constitutes the Sevenfold Reversal; the external conjunction of Metal and Wood constitutes the Ninefold Return—this is the Ninefold Return and Sevenfold Reversal of the Minor Celestial Cycle. From the perspective of the entire alchemical method, the Minor Celestial Cycle is the Sevenfold Reversal, the *Jade Fluid Returned Elixir*; the Major Celestial Cycle is the Ninefold Return, the *Golden Fluid Great Returned Elixir*. If considering only the Minor or Major Celestial Cycle individually, then within the Minor Celestial Cycle, both Sevenfold Reversal and Ninefold Return are present; within the Major Celestial Cycle, both are likewise present.

In the entire alchemical method, the Minor Celestial Cycle is designated the Sevenfold Reversal because it is governed by the union of Kan and Li in the north and south. The true fire of the Gate of Life surges upward to the heart palace—this is Kan returning to Li. The cool fluid from the heart descends to the Gate of Life—this is Li returning to Kun, called the *Internal Elixir*, also known as the *Jade Fluid Returned Elixir*. Jade nourishes the self; having reverted to the youthful body, one attains longevity—thus it is called *refining the self*, which is *nurturing the self*. The cool fluid descending from the crown is the Jade Fluid. At this stage, Li has transformed into Qian, and the Jade Fluid can repair the body’s broken vessels, restoring it to wholeness—hence it is called the *Jade Fluid Returned Elixir*.

As for the *Golden Fluid Great Returned Elixir* of the Major Celestial Cycle, the work of reverting to youth has already been accomplished, and the practice now resides entirely within the void. Nine is the number of yang; one gathers true yang from the void—this is also gathering the Qian Metal of "that," hence it is called the *Ninefold Return*, though distinctions must be made. If considering a partial alchemical method, then within the Sevenfold Reversal of the Minor Celestial Cycle, the Ninefold Return is also present; within the Ninefold Return of the Major Celestial Cycle, the Sevenfold Reversal is likewise present. In the Major Celestial Cycle, when yang qi ascends posteriorly and descends anteriorly, this is the Sevenfold Reversal.

Why distinguish between the union of Kan and Li in the north and south and the union of Qian and Kun at Zi and Wu? Because the human body contains two layers of heaven and earth, four yin and yang—this distinction arises from the division between the prenatal and postnatal. The prenatal has its heaven and earth, its yin and yang; the postnatal likewise has its heaven and earth, its yin and yang. In the prenatal, Qian is south and Kun is north, Li is east and Kan is west; in the postnatal, this shifts to Li in the south and Kan in the north, Qian in the east and Kun in the west. The prenatal yin and yang reside within the void—this is the conjunction of Metal and Wood at Mao and You, the union of east and west, which is also the union of Qian and Kun.

In the postnatal realm, Kan enters the body as the Gate of Life, while Li resides at the crown of the head. The yin and yang of Qian and Kun govern as the formless, ruling yin and yang; the yin and yang of Kan and Li, however, constitute the yin and yang within the human body. As the lesser void connects to the greater void, the great qi permeates the body’s orifices, and the prenatal lingers within the postnatal—thus, in the formless, Qian and Kun preside over Kan and Li.

Man’s breath communicates with heaven and earth; day and night, he draws in the great qi to invigorate it, enabling movement and action without perishing—otherwise, he would be lost. Man’s spirit of consciousness also depends on the great qi; sustained by it, the spirit may long abide in the body as its master—else, it scatters to the four directions.

Man is born through this formless heaven and earth, its yin and yang—hence the saying, “two layers of heaven and earth, four yin and yang.”

Li Qing’an’s comparison of man to a marionette is most apt. He states: “Consider the marionette—its limbs move, its steps shift in myriad ways. Yet the marionette does not move of itself; it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are tied to its joints, it is the puppeteer who moves them. Do you recognize this puppeteer?”

The marionette represents the physical form; the strings, the breath of the body; and the puppeteer, the true master within. The marionette moves because the strings move it; the strings do not move on their own—they are set in motion by the puppeteer. This puppeteer is the void itself, and thus the void is called the true master. Lead exists within the void, unseen by the eye; only the void, only this void, is the true master. The puppeteer stands outside the marionette, just as the master of the void lies beyond the body—hence the elixir method names it the “master from without.” One must allow this master to enter the body and become its lord; this is the inception of receiving qi, the true nature of Qian’s origin. Only this can serve as one’s enduring master; the spirit of consciousness cannot.

In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong styles himself "Grandfather Sun from Without"—precisely the master from without. When Sun Wukong subdues the Green Bull, the beast possesses a white ring that ensnares all manner of treasures; the Ruyi Jingu Bang of Sun Wukong, the demon-slaying sword of Prince Nezha, and even the fire implements of the Fire God—none escape its grasp. Though neither water nor fire could harm it, and Li Tianwang entreated Sun Wukong to steal it, the Bull Demon wore the bracelet on his wrist, rendering theft impossible. Thus, they journeyed westward to beseech the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata dispatched eighteen arhats, each bearing cinnabar elixir sand, to aid in the endeavor. The elixir sand could transform the earth into emptiness to ensnare the demon, yet still they failed. Following the Buddha’s counsel, they ascended to the Heaven of Separate Regret to seek the Most High Lord Lao, who revealed the demon to be the Green Bull and the white ring to be his own Diamond Bracelet, capable of transmuting demons. The bracelet had been stolen by the Bull while the cowherd boy slept, descending to sow chaos in the world. Lord Lao still possessed his Banana Fan, which had not been stolen; had it been taken as well, even he would have been powerless. With the fan, he fanned the Bull, whose strength melted and sinews numbed, revealing its true form. The Diamond Bracelet was then threaded through the Bull’s nostrils, subduing it. This ring is the Supreme Ultimate, the very "Center." The Supreme Ultimate is a void, supreme and without peer, from which all things arise; thus, it absorbs all things, and nothing can overcome it. The Buddha’s cinnabar elixir sand is also a void, hence its power to transform the earth into emptiness. The Banana Fan is true yin, and only true yin can restrain true yang. The Tathāgata comes from nowhere and goes nowhere, embodying the true emptiness of neither coming nor going. Only emptiness gives rise to wisdom, enabling recognition of the demon’s original form. Only within emptiness can the elixir coalesce, hence the cinnabar sand issues from the Tathāgata’s treasury. True cinnabar sand lends power—it is true yang. Finally, threading the Diamond Bracelet through the nostrils signifies the generation of medicine within the mysterious aperture, the very "Center." Every line in *Journey to the West* carries allegorical meaning.

When Tang Sanzang and his disciples cross the Heaven-Reaching River, they ride upon the back of an ancient turtle, white in color and vast as a canopy—this canopy is the origin of Qian and Kun. A cord is threaded through the turtle’s nostrils, resembling a bridle; this cord signifies unbroken continuity. The breath of respiration lies outside the nostrils, yet the primordial spirit settles here—this is the interdependence of heart and breath. When Sun Wukong finds himself within the belly of the Lion Demon King, he recalls bringing a collapsible pot from Guangdong, which he sets upon the three-pronged bone to cook a stew. He then thrusts his Ruyi Jingu Bang into the crown of his head, piercing a hole to serve as both skylight and chimney. This three-pronged bone is the yin heel aperture, connected to the upper mysterious aperture—together, they form the upper and lower "Centers." The Ruyi Jingu Bang opening the skylight symbolizes the thrusting vessel, linking to the external void. The yin heel aperture is encircled by the eight extraordinary vessels and the nine meridians, communicating with the upper mysterious aperture. The yin heel is the root of life, the mysterious aperture the root of nature; the dual cultivation of nature and life, the communion of the two Centers, is true intent. The union of midnight and noon is the firing times. Setting the furnace upon the three-pronged bone and using the Ruyi Jingu Bang to open a chimney for smoke clearly illustrates the activation of living midnight and living noon, unifying the qi—its meaning is evident and easily understood.

Nature is fundamentally emptiness. When it receives the mandate of Heaven, it resides within the body; but the spirit of consciousness usurps its place, forcing it to retreat and conceal itself without, obscuring its luminous essence. Thus, it remains external. "Grandfather Sun from Without" precisely points to this external nature. The great void is that, the intermediate yin is I; nature is that, emotion is I. The deluded fail to comprehend, mistaking "that" and "I" for personal pronouns and thus misinterpreting them as male and female. Yet in the classics of immortals and the scriptures of Buddhas, the terms "that" and "I" often have no relation to persons. "I" denotes emotion, while "that" represents nature. The void defies description, hence it is also denoted by "that." If I am the essence of the void, then "that" opposite me is naturally also void. The void within our bodies is likewise denoted by "that." Only with this void can the embryo form, and the intermediate yin enter to dwell within. The intermediate yin of emotion is the master of my body; the void of nature is also my master. The master of masters is called "that." Later generations, fearing misunderstanding, appended the word "home" to "that."

*The Awakening to Reality* states: "This supreme treasure exists in every household, yet fools fail to recognize it fully." It also says: "Every household possesses this household treasure." The human body is substantial, yet only the void can contain it. There is no person without a home, and no home without this void. My home is my void—the small void within the crown aperture; that home is the void of that—the great void of Heaven and Earth. Both my home and that home refer to the void. Later generations misinterpreted "that home" as referring to women. Only Li Xianhun’s words are most precise and clear: "That home is void, made substantial by my reality."

"That home is void, made substantial by my reality."

From these two phrases, one may attain thorough understanding.

When Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth) unite at the zi-wu axis, it is the convergence of Metal and Wood—also the fusion of the two soils, Wu and Ji. In the *Li* trigram, the central line is Ji soil, one’s own soil; Wood-Mercury is thus one’s own soil. Placing one’s own Ji soil within the void to seek Wu soil—namely, the single line within the *Kan* trigram—*Kan* is emptiness, nothingness. From nothingness arises being, generating this one line of Wu soil, which is true Lead. True Lead, Wu soil born of emptiness, arrives at the mysterious aperture to unite with Ji soil, and the two soils form the *gui* elixir.

Moreover, Lead is Metal, which is also Qian Metal; one takes Qian Metal as the *daogui* (knife and square). Daoist medicinal substances are named "daogui," and this meaning is also derived from this. The nine returns and seven reversions involve internally the union of Water and Fire—namely, the union of *Kan* and *Li*; externally, the union of Qian and Kun—also the harmonization of the two soils, Wu and Ji—this is true intention, and true intention is also the true embryo. When true intention is established, true breath is likewise established.

Ordinary intention unites with ordinary breath; true intention unites with true breath. When the Tang monk journeyed to the West to fetch the scriptures, he rode a dragon-horse—this dragon-horse is true breath. Guanyin Bodhisattva then sent the local earth deity to deliver a saddle, and this saddle is true intention. Breath and intention cannot be separated even for an instant.

Sha Wujing (Friar Sand) also represents true intention, while his eight-treasure monastic staff symbolizes true breath. Wujing never parts from his staff, just as the dragon-horse never parts from its saddle—both illustrate the principle of interdependence between mind and breath.

Within the mysterious aperture resides a warm, gentle qi—this is true intention—while the true breath in the abdomen opens and closes. Externally, there is one Yin and one Yang; internally, there is one Yin and one Yang—these are the two layers of Heaven and Earth, four sets of Yin and Yang. The body possesses postnatal Yin and Yang, while externally there exists prenatal Yin and Yang—are these not four sets of Yin and Yang?

As for the Heaven and Earth of the body: the crown is Heaven, and the abdomen is Earth. The external Heaven and Earth are the cauldron of the Great Void and the furnace of the Supreme Ultimate—these too form a Heaven and Earth. In truth, the cauldron is the furnace, and the furnace is the cauldron. The cauldron is not originally a cauldron, nor is the furnace truly a furnace. Master Wu said: "The cauldron is no cauldron at first; the furnace is not a jade furnace." From this, one may understand.

In the practice of the Dao, there are two centers: true intention and true breath. True breath resides in the fixed center—embryonic breathing opens and closes within the space one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel, "facing the navel wheel in front and the kidneys behind, with a true golden cauldron in between"—this is the "fixed center." True intention, however, dwells in the realm neither inside nor outside, between the inner void and the outer void, now rising, now descending, circulating within its bounds—thus true intention is the "unfixed center." Yet within it lies a point of intersection between the vertical and horizontal axes, which may be fixed here. Though unfixed, it still possesses fixity, for its bounds—above and below, front and back—are interconnected.

Yan Yuan said: "The more I look up at it, the higher it seems; the more I delve into it, the harder it becomes. I gaze ahead, and suddenly it is behind." (See *Analects*, "Zihan") This also means: when one looks up, its vastness knows no outer limit; when one looks down, its minuteness knows no inner boundary. Between above and below, front and back, there exists a center—this is the "unfixed center." If one establishes something towering, then it stands towering—unfixed, yet still fixed.

The *Great Learning* states: "What you dislike in those above, do not use to govern those below; what you dislike in those below, do not use to serve those above; what you dislike in those ahead, do not place before those behind; what you dislike in those behind, do not follow after those ahead; what you dislike on the right, do not apply to the left; what you dislike on the left, do not apply to the right. This is called the Dao of the compass and square." The compass and square define the rules of measurement—within above and below, front and back, left and right, a "center" is concealed. This aligns with the meaning of the *Huangting Jing*.

The *Huangting Jing* says: "Above is the soul-spirit, below is the Pass of Origin; on the left is Lesser Yang, on the right is Greater Yin; behind is the Secret Gate, ahead is the Gate of Life." Here, too, a "center" is concealed within the words. Scholars may contemplate this—all refer to the "unfixed center."

Lecture Seventeen: Spirit and Qi, Essence and Intention, Body and Mind.

The "Three Families Meeting" refines true gold—what is called the "Three Families Meeting" refers to the Small Celestial Cycle. The nine returns and seven reversions are precisely the Three Families Meeting. The *Jade Emperor Scripture* takes spirit, qi, and essence as the Three Treasures, naming them the Three Grades; when the Three Grades harmonize, it is called the convergence of the three into one, yet the Three Families are not these Three Grades. Since they are named "families," each contains more than one. Of the three, one is internal, one external, and one central: internally, water and fire unite as one family; externally, metal and wood merge as one family; and centrally, the two earths form a jade tablet as one family. These are the Three Families, comprising six elements—water, fire, metal, wood, and the two earths. Water and fire pair as yin and yang; metal and wood likewise pair as yin and yang; wu and ji (the two earths) are one yin and one yang, uniting in harmony.

Verifying this with the principle of the *River Diagram*: the east’s three and the south’s two sum to five, forming one family—the east’s three is nature, the south’s two is spirit; nature is quiescent, spirit is dynamic, with distinction between them, thus one family. The west’s four and the north’s one sum to five, forming one family—the west’s four is emotion, the north’s one is primordial essence; emotion is quiescent, essence is dynamic, thus one family. The central wu and ji, each bearing the number five, form a family of their own—these are the Three Families.

The south’s two is fire, li, yet the true mercury within li belongs to wood, the wood of the eastern direction—this is wood within fire, akin to Zhu Wuneng in *Journey to the West*; the east’s three and south’s two form one treasury. The north’s one is water, kan, yet the true lead within kan belongs to metal, the metal of the western direction—this is metal within water, akin to Sun Wukong; the north’s one and west’s four form one treasury. Wu and ji are true earth, akin to Sha Wujing, with the central two fives forming one treasury. When the three and five unite, only then is the complete Tang Sanzang formed.

The north’s one and west’s four are the primordial true lead, lead that comes from without; the east’s three and south’s two are true mercury, mercury that issues from within; wu and ji are the Central Palace, the true intention harmonizing between the two, thus serving as the Yellow Dame who brokers the union, causing true lead and true mercury to merge in the Central Palace.

The east’s three is yang, the south’s two is yin; the north’s one is yang, the west’s four is yin; wu is yang earth, ji is yin earth. These distinguish nature, emotion, spirit, essence, and intention: nature and spirit unite as a couple, emotion and essence unite as a couple, wu and ji form a couple of their own—these are three pairs of husband and wife. When husband and wife unite, they form one family, thus the Three Families, each with one husband and one wife.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are the Five Phases; once paired, they revert to the Three Families. When the Three Families meet, they return from three to one; reverting three to one relies entirely on the function of true intention.

The true lead residing without and the true mercury residing within are harmonized in the Central Palace, where they reunite as husband and wife, only then able to form the elixir. Thus, true lead is called the "White-Faced Gentleman," true mercury the "Green-Clad Maiden," and true intention the "Yellow Matron." With the Yellow Matron as matchmaker, she draws together the inner and outer true mercury and true lead, pairing them as husband and wife—this is the Dao of uniting inner and outer, the meeting of the Three Families.

As *Wuzhen* says, "This supreme treasure exists in every household," for only through the union of one husband and one wife, the coupling of yin and yang, is life generated. It is not the solitary yin or isolated yang within the body, hence it is called a "household." When the Three Families meet in the Yellow Court’s divine chamber—within the Central Palace’s Yellow Court—the three treasures of inner essence, qi, and spirit naturally merge into one. This is the meeting of the Three Families, also known as the nine returns and seven reversions.

The outer medicine is lead; the inner medicine is mercury. When inner and outer unite, the two earths form the *gui* tablet. True lead is the one yang within *kan* (Water), *wu* earth; true mercury is the one yin within *li* (Fire), *ji* earth. When the two earths merge, the Three Families become one family. Returning from three to one accords with the principle of Heaven and Earth.

First there was the Limitless, then the Supreme Ultimate was born. From nothing, something arises—from the extreme of stillness, the One and the Spirit emerge. This is the Supreme Ultimate’s primordial *qi*, the root of creation, thus called the "Ancestral *Qi*," also the *Taiyi*’s true-contained *qi*. *Taiyi* is Heaven’s One, contained within water, hence the "true-contained *qi*" is the "gold within water." When movement reaches its extreme and stillness arises, yin *qi* is born, forming the Two Modes—Heaven above, Earth below. The void between them retains the Supreme Ultimate, identical in essence to the Limitless’s truth. Thus, three is one, and one is emptiness.

Once the Five Phases are established, they transform from five to three, and from three to one. This function resides entirely in the central void—the true emptiness of the Limitless, the primordial *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate. In human cultivation, the Five Phases within our bodies follow the same principle, their function centered in the Central Palace’s true earth. Earth is intention, and this intention is an undistracted, singular focus. Our firing times depend entirely on the regulation of the Central Palace’s intention; true intention is spiritual awareness.

As *Wuzhen Pian* states: "There is a natural true firing time—no need for kindling or forced breath." This firing time arises spontaneously. If one acts contrary to nature, water and fire cannot merge, metal and wood cannot unite, and the path becomes deviant and false.

As the *Canticle* says: "What is naturally so cannot be a false path." The *Daodejing* states: "Heaven follows the Dao, the Dao follows nature." This is non-action that accomplishes all—when the mind is empty and vast, fundamentally without action, it embodies the primordial chaos of the Great Void. Within the Central Palace, metal, wood, water, and fire naturally merge and unite, acting without acting.

When body and mind are without action, spirit and *qi* naturally act; only when body and mind are without action can spirit and *qi* truly act. As *Wuzhen Pian* says: "At first, action is unseen by others; only when non-action is achieved do all recognize it." Within the formless and shapeless, the elixir coalesces naturally, unseen.

For non-action pertains to body and mind, while action pertains to spirit and *qi*. Only through non-action can there be action—action in spirit and *qi*, which others cannot perceive.

Among the aforementioned nature, emotion, spirit, essence, and intention, there is a distinction between prior and posterior Heaven. The east’s three is nature, the true yang’s primordial *qi*, also emptiness. Within true emptiness lies wondrous existence, entirely of prior Heaven’s prior Heaven. The south’s two is original spirit, also prior Heaven. The west’s four is emotion, which at conception, when male and female emotions and spirits unite, becomes the nature of temperament. The north’s one is original essence, prior Heaven within posterior Heaven. Thus, the north’s one and west’s four are both prior Heaven within posterior Heaven. The central *wu* and *ji* are *wu* as prior Heaven and *ji* as posterior Heaven.

Therefore, nature and spirit meet as prior Heaven, emotion and essence meet as prior Heaven within posterior Heaven, and intention meets as posterior Heaven with prior Heaven—this describes the virgin body. For those who have broken the body and cultivate the Dao, the situation differs.

The east’s three, true nature, hides in the realm of profound obscurity, unseen. The south’s two, original spirit, transforms into consciousness, and nature and spirit become posterior Heaven. The *kun*’s primordial emotion ascends to *qian*, prior Heaven recedes, and consciousness takes control, turning emotion into nature. Emotion and essence, as prior Heaven within posterior Heaven, also shift. Only *wu* and *ji* remain unchanged—one prior Heaven, one posterior Heaven.

*The Journey to the West*, from the first to the seventh chapter, symbolizes cultivation in the virgin body, hence its ease. From the fourteenth chapter, "Two-Border Mountain," to the end, it symbolizes cultivation after breaking the body, hence its difficulty.

Sun Wukong is true yang, the nature of prior Heaven. Zhu Bajie is the nature of gluttony and lust, prior Heaven within posterior Heaven. The Buddha says parents conceive the body through desire, carrying that desire, so Bajie loves wine and women. A true spiritual nature mistakenly entered a pig’s womb, thus his true nature is obscured by consciousness.

For those cultivating after breaking the body, true yang from the void must enter the body, consciousness must revert to original spirit, and after stillness and stability, true intention arises, forming the true embryo. Thus, Sha Wujing is the last to attain in *The Journey to the West*.

Only after achieving the Nine Returns may one proceed to the Seven Reversions, attaining the true intention of the Central Palace, where singular focus remains unscattered—this is the principle.

Zhu Bajie was born at Fuling Mountain in Cloud Chain Cave. *Fuling* signifies the spark of true nature, the fortune of man; Fuling Mountain is also the Vermilion Mansion. *Cloud Chain Cave* denotes a sealed cavern mouth, as true nature is obscured by gluttony and lust, hence symbolized by cloud and chain.

Sun Wukong was born on Flower-Fruit Mountain, the primordial ancestral *qi* from which all things arise. Beneath the Water Curtain Cave lies an iron bridge, signifying metal within water. *"Square Inch Mountain of the Numinous Terrace"* refers to the square inch of the numinous terrace; *"Cave of the Slanting Moon and Three Stars"* is the character *xin* (心, "heart") in full—this is the original heart, not the fleshy organ. The *"Slanting Moon and Three Stars"* is also called the Crescent Moon Crucible, where the slanting moon is the small void, and the three stars are the square inch, the gateway. Observe the two diagrams below to grasp the meaning of *"Slanting Moon and Three Stars."*

Sun Wukong’s return from the Patriarch to Flower-Fruit Mountain signifies drawing from *kan* to fill *li*; stealing weapons from the Ao-Lai Kingdom represents accumulating metal. Obtaining the golden-hooped staff from the Dragon Palace is the Nine Returns; erasing his name from the Register of Life and Death at King Yama’s court signifies attaining immortality through cultivation. His appointment as *Bima Wen* (Protector of the Horses) denotes the work of warming and nurturing. After forming the inner elixir, a year of warming fire is required—*ma* (horse) is *wu* (noon) fire, and *tianma* (heavenly horse) is *qian*. The title *"Great Sage Equaling Heaven"* signifies immortality and longevity equal to heaven. Only then can one project spirit, hence the *"Great Sage Equaling Heaven’s"* palace contains the *"Peace"* and *"Tranquility"* bureaus. The uproar at the Peach Banquet and the havoc in Heaven represent the Great Celestial Cycle. Erlang is true yin, Sun Wukong true yang; true yang meeting true yin results in no victory or defeat. The three heads and six arms signify the *qian* and *kun* hexagrams. The golden bracelet is the primordial Supreme Polarity; true yang is the primordial unity of *qi*, akin to the Supreme Polarity, thus able to subdue Sun Wukong’s family. Pressing him under the Eight Trigrams Furnace is the work of nursing; the Buddha pressing him beneath the Five Phases Mountain is the work of returning to the void.

The role of *Bima Wen* is most crucial. After the embryo is formed, a year of warming work must follow before undertaking the Great Celestial Cycle. This year precedes the Great Celestial Cycle, not follows it. The medicine of the Small Celestial Cycle is born then gathered; the medicine of the Great Celestial Cycle is gathered then born. Only when metal accumulates to fullness can one transform into a body of pure yang. The nursing work of the Great Celestial Cycle spans three years. After the Small Celestial Cycle, a year of warming yields the red orb. After spirit projection, nine years of wall-facing work follow. The so-called year of bathing, three years of nursing, and nine years of wall-facing all employ yang numbers, roughly indicating the pace of progress, which depends entirely on the diligence of one’s root *qi*—no uniform standard applies.

The Small Celestial Cycle forms the inner elixir, also called the yin elixir, sealed and secured an inch and three-tenths below the navel. This is the return of the great medicine to the furnace, the inner elixir sealed within, revolving like a wheel. Breathing becomes natural, opening and closing like a fetus in the womb—ordinary breath reverts to fetal breath. Advancing further, one refines *qi* into spirit, fetal breath reverting to true breath. True breath is breathlessness; only when the six pulses fully cease can one perform the fire times of the Great Celestial Cycle and project spirit—this is the completion of life through the inner elixir. Upon its formation, the old revert to youth, white hair turns black. Women practicing this also regain youth. Men retract the external yang; women sever the red dragon. The red dragon is *tiankui*; reverting to a maiden’s body and cutting off *tiankui* is also called *"transforming the female into the male."* The distinction between male and female lies in *tiankui*; severing it renders one no different from a man. Men manifest the hidden phase of the horse’s yin; women sever the red dragon—this is the fetal immortal. The *Yellow Court Classic* states, *"The zither’s heart, thrice layered, dances the fetal immortal,"* referring precisely to this. If preserved without loss, one may attain ageless longevity, called a human immortal. Further progress yields an earth immortal, a terrestrial transcendent. Earth immortals possess transformative abilities; human immortals do not. Forming the inner elixir makes one a human immortal; after a year of warming work, one becomes an earth immortal. After this year of warming, one achieves longevity, impervious to illness and harm. Without warming work, after sixteen years, the five thousand four hundred days of the yellow path will break the body. For men, this spans five thousand four hundred eighty days; for women, five thousand forty-eight days. Breaking the body again reduces one to a child’s state, no different from an ordinary person. Thus, warming work is most essential—without it, one endures only fifteen years. With a year of warming, the body need not break again, a natural transformation beyond further dissolution. Yet if the mind-horse and heart-ape are unchecked, ruin may still follow, as with the Red Lotus Monk of the Jin dynasty. During Zheng Chenggong’s time, a monk possessed Daoist arts, invulnerable to blades. Chenggong, troubled, consulted his officers on how to defeat him.

An adjutant then spoke, saying, "This poses no difficulty. I have a method to break him." He summoned courtesans to fill the room and tested the monk, who remained unmoved as before. Next, he ordered the courtesans to chase one another naked and to engage in intercourse before him. Seeing the monk suddenly close his eyes, the adjutant knew his heart had stirred. Seizing the moment, he raised his blade from behind and struck—whereupon the monk’s head fell to the ground. This is an example of ruin through corruption.

Thus, one must undergo a year of warming work to face circumstances without attachment, seeing form yet not as form. Yet in extraordinary situations, such as the example above, one may still be undone. Therefore, one must cultivate the work of completing the nature to achieve eternal existence. The Great Celestial Cycle is precisely the work of completing the nature.

External elixir completes life; internal elixir completes nature. External elixir forms the inner cinnabar; internal elixir forms the outer cinnabar. Only by forming the outer cinnabar can one depart the bodily shell and transform freely. After the inner cinnabar is achieved, with a year of warming, should one face inevitable death—whether through events demanding utmost loyalty or filial piety, or encountering disasters and treacherous schemes—though the body perishes, the primordial spirit remains luminous and indestructible. Like loyal ministers and filial sons who die to preserve their integrity, or those who succumb to karmic retribution or ambush, after death, the primordial spirit retains its agency and may seek rebirth by seizing a womb.

Once the body dies, the luminous primordial spirit naturally discerns where to find immortals and selects a family of ancestral virtue for rebirth. During the parents’ union, it enters the womb first, preventing other intermediate beings from occupying it—this is "rebirth," choosing a womb and entering it ahead of others. As for "seizing a womb," the luminous primordial spirit perceives which family possesses virtue and can produce a human immortal. Calculating the moment of birth, it stirs the intermediate being within the fetus. At the moment of delivery, it seizes the womb from the intermediate being, expelling it and entering itself—this is "seizing a womb."

Only yin spirits can perform rebirth and womb-seizing. Though superior to ordinary spirits, they remain yin spirits and thus may employ these methods. At this stage, one’s innate spiritual root enables the cultivation of immortality from a child’s body. All who cultivate immortality from a child’s body originate from rebirth or womb-seizing. The Venerable Mahākāśyapa of the Western Regions, during the Six Dynasties, was reborn into the Xiao family—evidence that in his native land, his work remained incomplete. Śākyamuni declared that he had cultivated for seventeen lifetimes across seventeen kalpas, each time emerging through rebirth or womb-seizing.

All who have established the foundation can perform rebirth and womb-seizing. Combined with "old dwelling" and "relocation," these constitute the "Four Fruits of the Path." In Buddhism, they are known as Arhat, Sotāpanna, Sakṛdāgāmin, and Anāgāmin. "Old dwelling" corresponds to the Arhat fruit; "relocation" refers to reviving in a corpse. If one’s yin spirit is cultivated but not yet perfected, one may borrow another’s recently deceased body, reanimating it to restore human form—this is "relocation," akin to a person changing residences.

Immortal Li Tieguai was originally Lord Ningyang, who had already cultivated the ability to project his yin spirit. One day, summoned by the Celestial Most High, he prepared to depart his body in spirit, instructing his disciple to guard his physical form. He cautioned, "If I do not return in seven days, you may bury my body." On the fifth day, the disciple’s mother fell gravely ill, leaving him torn. Though he dared not leave, on the sixth day, his uncle arrived, urging him to return home due to his mother’s condition. The disciple, bound by duty to guard his master’s body, still refused to go. As they deliberated, calculating that only eight hours remained until the seven-day limit, they assumed the master would not return and buried his body before the disciple hurried home. Upon arriving, Lord Ningyang returned to find his body interred. Nearby, a beggar had frozen to death outside a mountain cave. His primordial spirit entered the corpse, reviving it as a cripple.

He then visited his disciple’s home, where the disciple wept bitterly. Hearing his name called, the disciple exclaimed, "How your voice resembles my master’s!" Lord Ningyang revealed, "It is I, your master. You may recognize me by my voice. I do not blame you for burying my body. I foresaw this— the Celestial Most High had already informed me. I can revive your mother." With a breath, he restored her to life. Overjoyed, the disciple believed him to be his master. Thus, Lord Ningyang became the Cripple Immortal.

Having first cultivated the yin spirit, he could ascend to heaven and attend gatherings like the Peach Assembly. The Celestial Most High had previously advised him to refine his yang spirit. After becoming a cripple, he resumed cultivation of the yang spirit and attained immortality. These Four Fruits of the Path are not the ultimate attainment. In Buddhism, they are termed the "Hearers and Solitary Realizers" of the lesser vehicle. Unable to return to emptiness and merge with the void, they achieve only earthly immortality, incapable of divine transformations for universal salvation. Buddhism regards them as "self-liberated ones," concerned only with their own liberation.

Advancing further, one becomes a bodhisattva, possessing divine powers to save the world and ferry beings across suffering. Heavenly immortals, like buddhas, embrace the vow of universal salvation, becoming "Great Awakened Golden Immortals" who transcend the Three Realms and endure eternally without decay. The Most High Lord Lao has already undergone seven cycles of primordial chaos without dissolution. True Man Zhang Sanfeng said, "People often speak of worldly affairs as unfinished. To complete them, one must transcend the world."

If one’s parents are still living and major affairs remain unfinished, one may first lay the foundation and complete the initial stage of practice. Once these affairs are settled, one may then proceed to the great elixir practice—this is also permissible. Those who aspire to cultivate but neglect to lay the foundation risk sudden death with no time to remedy it.

In this world, three things are most difficult to attain: first, the rarity of obtaining a human body; second, the scarcity of encountering the Dao’s turning (Dao yun), for as Buddhism often says, “the Dao’s turning is hard to meet”—without it, cultivation rarely succeeds; third, the difficulty of finding a true teacher. Given these three challenges, one must cultivate without delay, lest in old age one’s lead and mercury diminish. By then, primordial qi will have been exhausted, and the elixir cannot be returned.

The first step in Daoist practice is most crucial. To establish the initial foundation of the elixir, one must first set aside sixty days—whether beginning with sleep practice or seated meditation—engaging in six sessions daily to gradually attain proficiency. Proficiency means natural spiritual awareness, which is the natural firing process. Only when one reaches this natural firing of spiritual awareness can the return be achieved; otherwise, the water source remains impure.

At present, practice begins with effort, then progresses to smoothness, and finally to effortless mastery. Once effortless ease is attained, success comes readily. Daoists call this stage “entering the chamber,” while Buddhists term it “closing the retreat.” Only after completing these sixty days of practice can one proceed; otherwise, it is exceedingly difficult.

If we cannot yet enter the chamber, we must first purify the heart. However, to reach proficiency requires three years of practice—at least one year. Thus, it is wise to first undertake several months of chamber practice. If entering the chamber is not yet possible, one must subdue distracting thoughts, making the heart as vast as the great void. Practicing four or five sessions daily will facilitate progress, with each session lasting twenty to thirty minutes. One may set the heart aside, completing practice before attending to other matters.

In refining the self, one must practice at least six times daily, once every two hours. During practice, the heart must be fully released, and both body and mind stilled. Within five minutes, yang will arise, and each session of twenty to thirty minutes will suffice to complete the work. One must never begin diligently only to grow lax later. Daily practice should be frequent, and within stillness, the heart must remain lively. Only through frequent practice can one gradually attain naturalness.

Initially, there is no fixed forgetting; one must first subdue thoughts. If a thought arises and cannot be stilled, one should cease practice until the thought is dispelled. If thoughts arise during seated meditation, the practice will be ineffective. Only when the heart is still and thoughts do not arise can one proceed.

How to attain proficiency depends entirely on personal realization—others cannot assist. The terms “comprehension” and “awakening” are often discussed. During practice, the heart must be free of affairs yet not attached to emptiness, like the state upon waking in the morning—utterly devoid of thoughts, yet without the thought of being thoughtless. When one realizes the state of no-heart and no-thought, yang will naturally arise. However, this process may be slow, as it requires accumulation over time—hence the need for one to three years.

To attain proficiency, one must first accumulate essence and refine qi. Only when the abdomen holds gold can proficiency be achieved. As the *Awakening to Reality* states, “Not knowing to refine lead and first fill the abdomen, I teach you to guard the hall of gold.” Returning to emptiness is the work of accumulating gold, which is also the practice of emptying the heart and filling the abdomen. Emptying the heart and filling the abdomen is the work of returning. First, true emptiness; second, wondrous existence—these are interconnected, and both involve subduing the heart.

How to subdue the heart is most thoroughly explained in the *Diamond Sutra*. The next lecture will continue with the *Diamond Sutra*, which may clarify these matters.

**Lecture Eighteen: Subduing the Heart Begins with Subduing the Four Marks**
*The Diamond’s Prajñā Leaves Gold and Discards Dross*

How to abide in the heart and how to subdue it is difficult to express. Even with a thousand words, clarity is not easily achieved. A heart set on something is not the Dao, nor is a heart devoid of all. Between having and not having, there lies the true meaning of neither clinging to existence nor to emptiness. The heart may exist, yet leave no trace; it may seem absent, yet not entirely so—like a mass of true intent, undispersed and unyielding, its appearance that of primordial chaos.

Master Qiu said, “If one can grasp the secret of no-heart, one will surely become a Great Luo Immortal.” Yet a heart that is utterly dead is not permissible. There is a true secret here: it must be lively and empty, for only then is it the primordial spirit. If the heart is too rigid, not only will the acquired spirit perish, but the primordial spirit will also fade.

Between existence and emptiness, between weight and lightness, one must cultivate realization. Seeing the heart as the Buddha is possible only in primordial chaos. The *Book of Documents* states, “The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Only with utmost refinement and singular focus can one truly hold to the center.” (See *Book of Documents: Counsels of Yu*)

“The human heart is perilous”—any attachment to the heart makes it human. “The Dao-heart is subtle”—discarding the human heart reveals the Dao-heart. If the heart is weighed down, it is the human heart; the Dao-heart is exceedingly subtle, while the human heart is exceedingly perilous. Between peril and subtlety, one must carefully cultivate realization, adhering to the center with utmost refinement and singular focus. Refinement is subtlety; by realizing the subtlest depths with sincerity and concentration, one can “truly hold to the center.”

The work of "holding to the center" manifests in the practitioner’s body as the center containing the One. The *Dao De Jing* states, “Grasp the One, and the myriad affairs flourish.” Between the center and the One, there is a distinction: consider the kernels of peach and plum, each formed by two halves—these halves are the one yin and one yang. The hollow between them, slightly raised, is the true center, and within this emptiness resides a single *qi*. Without this *qi*, life cannot exist.

Within the center lies the One. Confucius said, “My Way is threaded through with a single principle.” (See *Analects: Li Ren*) The center is emptiness; the One is being. The center is true emptiness; the One is the singular *qi*, the primordial *qi* that cradles the true. Only emptiness can generate boundless transformation; only the One can foster inexhaustible growth. If there is the One but no emptiness, it cannot be properly established.

Nature is true emptiness, yet within it lies wondrous being; life is wondrous being, yet within it lies true emptiness. If one attains the secret of no-mind, one can grasp the true meaning of true emptiness. From true emptiness alone can wondrous being arise. When the discriminating mind vanishes, one returns to primordial chaos—the state before heaven and earth were sundered. Only then does emptiness give birth to true yang. Though this true yang arises from the resonance of emptiness, it is emptiness shaped by human effort. Through this resonance, a single *qi* emerges, birthing true yang. Without true emptiness, wondrous being cannot arise; true yang *is* wondrous being.

The postnatal body, broken and corporeal, cannot attain emptiness, so one must subdue the heart—akin to taming the dragon and tiger, a task of no small difficulty. Here, we turn to the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* for elucidation. “Thus have I heard”: this Dharma is as such, and I have heard it from the Buddha.

“The Tathāgata was in the Jetavana Grove with a great assembly of twelve hundred and fifty bhikṣus.” At this time, the Tathāgata took his meal. In Buddhist practice, one must beg alms from seven households before partaking, “proceeding in order from door to door,” then returning to eat. After the meal, he washed his feet, for having gone forth to beg, they were soiled with dust; only after cleansing them until not a speck remained would he expound the Dharma. Subhūti, “baring his right shoulder,” rose and addressed the Buddha, saying: “Rare is the World-Honored One.” *Rare* here is a term of reverence.

The central purport of this sūtra lies entirely in the arising of the *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind. *Bodhi* means awakening; *samya*k is rightness; *sama* is equality; *anuttarā* means supreme—thus, “the mind of supreme right and equal awakening.” “World-Honored One, how should the bodhisattvas and good men and good women who have set forth in the Mahāyāna generate the mind of supreme right and equal awakening? How should they abide in it? How should they subdue their minds?”

Supreme right and equal awakening is spiritual awakening—natural, divine awareness—unsurpassed in goodness, supreme beyond compare. The human mind is most mutable, like a dragon; as a Tang poet said, “In meditation, tame the poisonous dragon” (Wang Wei, *Passing by Xiangji Temple*). If even the dragon is called *poisonous*, its mutability is extreme—how then to subdue this dragon? The tiger is a man-eating beast, most fierce and savage—how then to tame this tiger? To make the mutable unmoving and the savage docile is spoken of in terms of the human mind. Only by subduing the human mind can one abide in this right awakening.

What does it mean to *abide*? It means to dwell in this *samyak-saṃbodhi* mind. How can one generate this mind of right and equal awakening and abide in it permanently? Even those of the postnatal, broken body may at times generate this mind, but it lasts but an instant before shifting; *abiding* means permanence. The Buddha replied: “They should abide thus, thus subduing their minds.” *Thus* means just so. Beyond these words, there is no language that can describe it; thus he answered in this way. *Thus* refers to the mind’s original nature. The mind of *samyak-saṃbodhi* is inherently one’s own, merely obscured by discriminating consciousness and thus unseen. By clarifying the mind and perceiving one’s nature, one naturally accomplishes this—purely a matter of natural subduing and natural abiding. If the mind is forcibly restrained, it is not empty; even if right awakening arises, it is not true, for the mind is already obstructed.

The mind without mind is the original mind; the awakening without awakening is true awakening. When the fundamental nature is quiescent and extinguished, Buddhists call this “the *nirodha-samāpatti* of extinction.” Only after extinction can great samādhi be attained. In the first dhyāna, thought is stilled; in the second, breath is stilled; in the third, the pulse is stilled—meaning the six pulses cease entirely. Breath and thought depend on each other; when thought is stilled, one forgets thought; when breath is stilled, breath ceases—thus, with the cessation of respiration, true breath is established. When breath and pulse are extinguished, there is no-thought and emptiness.

“Of all the kinds of sentient beings—whether born from eggs, wombs, moisture, or transformation; whether with form or without form; whether with thought, without thought, or neither with nor without thought—the Buddha causes them all to enter *nirvāṇa* without remainder and thus leads them to extinction.” This is the meaning of “the *nirodha-samāpatti* of extinction.” “Though he thus leads all sentient beings to extinction, in truth, not a single being is led to extinction by him.” For those beings led to extinction are not extinguished by the Buddha but extinguish themselves. Not to be born and not to perish is *nirvāṇa*—the prenatal nature. Though countless beings enter this *nirvāṇa* and preserve their unborn, imperishable nature, it is not that the Tathāgata possesses a method to extinguish them; all beings liberate themselves.

In the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, Ānanda faced calamity, trapped in the chamber of demonic women, nearly destroying his precept-body. The Buddha rescued him, and Ānanda, seeing the Buddha, wept. The Buddha said to Ānanda: “You have not yet attained the *āsrava-kṣaya-jñāna*, so you could not avoid this calamity.” Ānanda wept and said to the Buddha: “I am the Buddha’s beloved disciple, and the Buddha cherishes me most. I thought the Buddha’s Dharma had been fully transmitted to me, yet I had not attained the *āsrava-kṣaya* and could not avoid stumbling.” His heart was filled with despair. He did not realize that this matter requires first extinguishing the discriminating consciousness—it lies entirely in one’s own clarification of the mind and perception of nature, and cannot be accomplished by another.

Why is it said that no being is led to extinction by the Buddha? Because one liberates oneself by liberating others; first, one must eliminate the four marks. Removing these four marks cannot be done by another. If the Buddha were to extinguish beings, the Buddha would still possess the four marks. The mark of self is one’s own mind; the mark of others is the perception of others in one’s mind. With these perceptions of self and others, the mind cannot be empty. The mark of sentient beings is the mark of form; the mark of lifespan is the mark of cultivation. With these four marks, how can one accomplish the Dao?

A bodhisattva must eliminate the four marks. If the Buddha were to extinguish beings, the Buddha would not have removed these four marks. Only by beings liberating themselves can the four marks be absent—this is what is meant by “subduing the mind,” which is to eliminate these four marks. Of these, the mark of self is the heaviest; the others follow. Laozi said: “Inwardly observe the mind, and the mind has no mind”—this is eliminating the mark of self. “Externally observe form, and form has no form”—this is eliminating the mark of others. “From afar observe things, and things have no things.”

"is the mark of sentient beings. After extinguishing these three marks, one must further eliminate the mark of lifespan. Only by removing these four marks can the mind be subdued; otherwise, one cannot arouse the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment. After eliminating the four marks, we then speak of generosity. A bodhisattva’s generosity should not abide in the mark of form. Internally, the six senses; externally, the six dusts—these a bodhisattva should not abide in, yet still practice generosity. Practicing generosity is performing merit; generosity without abiding in marks yields boundless merit. Eliminating the four marks is to be without mind; without mind, there are no marks; merit without marks is true merit."

The Buddha asked, "Subhūti, what do you think? Can empty space be measured? Can the four directions and above and below be measured?" The empty space between the four directions and above and below is the center; the size of the center cannot be measured. The merit of a bodhisattva’s generosity without abiding in marks is likewise like empty space, immeasurable. A bodhisattva’s mind should abide thus: not abiding in marks, abiding as "taught"—abiding in no-marks, yet abiding in non-abiding. Non-abiding abiding is true abiding; non-fixed samādhi is great samādhi, for abiding is samādhi. One should proceed thus to break through all marks.

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can one see the Tathāgata by means of bodily marks?"
He replied, "No, one cannot see the Tathāgata by means of bodily marks." The bodily marks spoken of by the Tathāgata are not marks of form. "All marks that exist are false and illusory"; whatever has marks in heaven and earth is illusory. Only without marks can one see the Tathāgata. Here, "marks" includes dharma-marks. The Tathāgata is without coming or going, utterly empty; to have marks is not it.

First from the four marks, then the six senses and six dusts—extending this, all marks that exist are false and illusory. To cling even slightly to marks is not supreme perfect enlightenment. Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying, "Will there be sentient beings who can generate faith?"
The Buddha replied, "Do not speak thus definitively. In the last five hundred years, there will be those who uphold the precepts and cultivate the Buddha Way. Such a person has already planted good roots before ten thousand buddhas over countless lifetimes, and thus can generate reverent faith. Otherwise, they cannot. The Tathāgata fully knows and sees those who can generate faith in these words; their merit is boundless."

One who can believe these words has already relinquished the marks of person, self, sentient beings, and lifespan, as well as dharma-marks and non-dharma-marks. The marks of person, self, and so on are real marks; dharma-marks are illusory marks. When cultivating, the marks one perceives are illusory marks, that is, dharma-marks. Non-dharma-marks are the marks of not clinging to any marks. If one has the mind that does not cling to marks, one clings to non-dharma-marks.

Why is this? When sentient beings separate the mind from marks, is this not clinging to marks? When the mind moves, this is clinging to marks. Only in non-knowing and non-perception can one not cling. If one clings to dharma-marks, one clings to person and self. Clinging to illusory marks is clinging to real marks; clinging to non-dharma-marks is clinging to the four marks. Marks arise from the mind; once the mind arises, there is no difference from clinging to marks. Therefore, one must see marks as no-marks; neither dharma nor non-dharma should be clung to.

You should know that the Dharma spoken by the Buddha is like a raft: "Even the Dharma should be relinquished, how much more so non-Dharma." Thus it is said, "For forty-nine years, I have not spoken a single word." In *Journey to the West*, obtaining the wordless scriptures is also good, but for fear that people of the Eastern Land would not understand, this is the meaning of not speaking even a single word.

"Subhūti, what do you think? Has the Buddha attained supreme perfect enlightenment? Is the Buddha expounding the Dharma here?"
He answered, "There is no fixed Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment to be attained; since there is no fixed Dharma to be attained, there is also no fixed Dharma to be expounded." For the Buddha-Dharma is not something to be grasped or spoken. What is spoken is not the Dharma, yet it is the Dharma. Thus buddhas and immortals take "nothing" as the Dharma, possessing not a single thing. "Taking nothing as the Dharma, yet within it there are distinctions." The root source is only the word "nothing," yet within the firing times there are distinctions. "Taking nothing as the Dharma"—the entire meaning is already pointed out here. Those who cultivate the Dao should take non-mind as their foundation; only the merit of non-mind is the greatest.

The Buddha asked Subhūti, "If one were to give alms with the seven treasures filling a trichiliocosm, would the blessings be many?"
He replied, "Extremely many." Yet blessings are not the nature of blessings; thus if one has the mind seeking blessings, they are not many. "However, if someone receives and upholds this sutra and explains it to others, their blessings surpass those of giving the seven treasures filling a trichiliocosm." For all buddhas and the Dharma arise from this sutra and these four-line verses: "What is called the Buddha-Dharma is not the Buddha-Dharma"—it still takes no-Dharma as the Dharma.

Next are the "Four Fruits." The fruit of Stream-Enterer is called "entering the stream," not entering the six dusts of form and so on. Only with the mind free of the six dusts can one attain the fruit of Stream-Enterer; if one has a mind, one cannot attain it. The Stream-Enterer is the fruit of the yin-spirit; even this requires non-mind, how much more so the yang-spirit, which requires even greater non-mind. The Once-Returner is "no coming and going"; having no coming and going is non-mind—if one has a mind, one cannot attain it. The Non-Returner is called "not coming," "yet truly there is nothing that does not come."

The term "not coming" truly has no such "not coming"; if one has a mind, then there is "not coming," and one cannot attain it. The Arhat is the yang-spirit, only then is it called the "Dao/Way," and it is not called a "fruit." The Arhat is named "truly no dharma exists"; if one has thoughts, one cannot attain this Dao/Way. To think of attaining the Arhat Dao/Way is to be attached to the four marks—how can one attain the Dao/Way? To have the mind of cultivating the Dao/Way is to be attached to the mark of the long-lived; to think, "I want to attain the Dao/Way," is to be attached to both the mark of self and the mark of the long-lived.

Subhūti attained the "Samādhi of Non-Contention," which is the practice of departing from desire. Departing from the desire realm, with no desire and nothing remaining in the mind, one attains the "Foremost Departure from Desire." Precisely because there is no such thought, one can attain the Dao/Way; if one thinks with the mind, desiring to attain this Dao/Way, the World-Honored One would not call such a one an attainer of the Dao/Way. "Not practicing a single dharma is called the practice of Āraṇya," which is the practice of non-contention.

The Buddha asked Subhūti: "When the Tathāgata was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha in the past, did he obtain any dharma?" He replied: "The Buddha obtained nothing." If it is not adornment, then it is adornment; without the mind of adornment, this is adornment. "One should thus generate a pure mind, and should not generate a mind that abides in form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma"—to generate a mind is to be impure. Only by generating a pure mind is it adornment. The Buddha’s mind is Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi; removing the mind of form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharma, "one should generate the mind without abiding in anything." To generate a pure mind is to be without abiding, and thus not attached to marks.

Throughout the twelve hours of the day, the mind generated without abiding is a pure mind, is the mind of the Dao/Way, and is also spiritual awareness. "Having a body like Mount Sumeru" is the Dharma-body. When not a single thought arises, it is called "pure"; when the mind’s terrace is empty of things, it is called "clean"; the mind without mind is the pure mind. What follows speaks of the merit of no-mind. Precisely because of no-mind is it great.

The number of grains of sand in the Ganges is already exceedingly many; if each of these grains of sand were another Ganges, the number would be immeasurable. If one were to take the seven treasures of as many trichiliocosms as there are grains of sand in these immeasurable Ganges and offer them in charity, the merit would also be immeasurable. Yet compared to the merit of one who receives, upholds, or explains this *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* to others, the latter’s merit is even greater.

Asuras belong to the demonic realm. "All the devas, humans, and asuras in the world should make offerings to this sutra and its four-line verses." If one can receive, uphold, recite, and read this sutra and its four-line verses, one has already attained no-mind and may be said to have truly attained. The Buddha taught the supreme One Vehicle of the dharma of no-mind, the merit of which is unsurpassed.

This sutra is called the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā*, one volume among the 579 volumes of the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra*, indestructible for ten thousand kalpas. Only by cultivating with the mind of no-mind can one attain it. Otherwise, one cannot. The dust of a trichiliocosm is not dust—only then is it called dust; it is not a world—only then is it called a world. Whenever there is a mind of right and wrong, of duality, one cannot become this thing. Only by having no right or wrong, no duality, can one accomplish it.

For example, if there is a teacup here, and someone says it is a teacup, another will say it is not a teacup and deny it. As soon as there is a name, there is right and wrong. Only by negating everything can one accomplish and stand alone. Thus it is said, "A dust-mote is not a dust-mote," "A world is not a world"—only then can this dust-mote and this world be established.

"One cannot see the Tathāgata through the thirty-two marks." The thirty-two marks are illusory marks, and also marks of what is not. Only by having no marks can one see him. To give one’s body and life in charity as many times as the grains of sand in the Ganges would yield great merit; yet the merit of one who receives, upholds, recites, and reads this sutra is even greater.

Those who hear the name of the *Vajracchedikā* and generate faith "immediately generate a pure mind and immediately generate the true mark." The true mark is not a mark; it is the wondrous existence born from emptiness, and thus it is the "foremost merit." Because to depart from marks is to be without marks, and to depart from all marks is to be a buddha, it is the "foremost rare merit" and is the "foremost pāramitā." To attain the foremost pāramitā is not the foremost pāramitā, for having the true mark is to be without marks.

In the past, when the Buddha was in the time of King Kali, he was dismembered limb by limb by the king yet had no trace of the four marks, and thus was called the "Kṣānti Ṛṣi." "One should generate a mind without abiding," which is also "one should generate the mind without abiding in anything." The mind of a bodhisattva is the mind of merit and giving. One should not abide in marks but, for the benefit of sentient beings, practice giving with no-mind. Those with mind and form are not sentient beings; only those without mind and form are sentient beings.

Only by not abiding in form when giving can one see form; if one has a mind, one does not see it. Those who know how to cultivate the Dao/Way see form and generate their mind, and their marks immediately vanish. Those who receive, uphold, recite, and read this sutra can attain immeasurable and boundless merit. If there are good men and good women who give their bodies in charity day after day for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, the merit would indeed be great.

Yet this still does not compare to the merit of transcribing, reciting, and reading this sutra, which is even greater. "This sutra is inconceivable, its boundless virtue beyond measure." Such a person has already attained the anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi of the Tathāgata.

Those who cling to marks or delight in lesser teachings cannot cultivate this sutra, nor transcribe, recite, explain, or expound it for others. Wherever this sutra resides, it should be revered as a stūpa or temple. If one who upholds this sutra is nonetheless despised by others, it is due to the karmic offenses of past lives. Yet now that one upholds this sutra, those past karmic offenses are immediately extinguished, and the Way is accomplished.

When the former Buddha was with Dīpaṃkara Buddha, though he made offerings to all buddhas and performed various meritorious deeds without idleness, compared to the merit of receiving and reciting this sutra, it does not equal one part in a thousand myriad koṭis. If the full extent of such a person’s merit were described, those who heard it might "fall into madness and doubt," unable to believe and accept, instead generating karmic offenses. For this sutra contains inconceivable meanings, and thus its karmic retribution is naturally inconceivable as well.

**Lecture Nineteen: The Buddha is Perfect Awakening; Only the Self Can Liberate the Self**

Forms are not like lightning or dew—what is called the "anuttarā-saṃyak-saṃbodhi mind" is precisely the pure mind free from the four forms: no self, no person, no sentient being, no lifespan. Extending this principle, "all forms whatsoever are illusory." Only by not clinging to the slightest form does one attain this mind of perfect enlightenment.

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* is the supreme treasure among Buddhist scriptures, just as the *Yijing* is to Confucianism and the *Lingbao* to Daoism. The Chan school, in particular, takes the revelation of *prajñā* as its core, making it the orthodox teaching of the Mahāyāna. Though schools like Tiantai and Pure Land also belong to the Mahāyāna, they differ in being provisional methods.

*Prajñāpāramitā* means "the wisdom that arrives at the other shore." Through this *prajñā* wisdom, one is born onto that shore. The term "that" here shares the same meaning as in Daoist references to "that realm" or "that self." The *Vajracchedikā* and the *Heart Sūtra* are both essential texts of the *Prajñā* corpus. The nature of *prajñā* wisdom is fundamentally empty. The six-hundred-fascicle *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* begins by expounding this emptiness in its first fascicle and culminates in the *Vajracchedikā* by fascicle five hundred seventy-nine. As the entire scripture nears its conclusion, it thoroughly elucidates the work of returning to emptiness: inwardly, the three minds are relinquished; outwardly, the four forms are extinguished. Ultimately, all forms are illusory, and the mind becomes pure.

The six senses interact with the six dusts, giving rise to the six consciousnesses. Only when the six consciousnesses are completely dissolved does one attain this pure mind. Only purity is non-action. "Non-action" does not mean idleness; sitting motionless while the mind generates chaotic thoughts is still not non-action. One must first purify the mind. With a pure mind, the body becomes non-active, and naturally, through non-action, nothing is left undone.

The body and mind of non-doing and non-action belong to the realm of spirit and *qi*. Only when the mind is pure can the spirit and *qi* act effectively. This pure mind is the natural spiritual awareness. When the mind is unmoving, it is emptiness; when it is about to move, it is natural spiritual awareness. Only this natural spiritual awareness can generate transformation and creation, for emptiness devoid of all things is the Dao, and the Dao is this natural spiritual awareness. Only at this stage can one gather external *qi* to obtain the elixir, refining it with spirit.

Bai Yuchan said: "Refining the elixir with fire to form the cinnabar is like guiding *qi* with spirit to accomplish the Dao." (See *Ziqing Zhixuan Ji: Xuanguan Xianmi Lun*) In truth, elixir and fire are one: when obtained, it is the elixir; when refined, it is fire. The entire process is the function of this natural spiritual awareness, which alchemical texts call the "true intention" or the "Dao-mind." It is self-so, requiring no deliberate effort yet capable of spontaneous action.

Through effort one attains ease. As Lü Zu said: "From striving one reaches ease; from subtlety one enters transformation." When practice reaches ease, the great transformation is called spirit. This spirit naturally guards the aperture. This natural spiritual awareness is both the elixir substance and the mysterious aperture.

Zhang Ziyang said: "The elixir substance arises in the mysterious aperture; the fire-timing ignites the yang furnace." (See *Jindan Sibai Zi*) Only with the elixir substance does the mysterious aperture arise. "Mysterious" is yang; yang arises within emptiness. Externally, it is called "image"; internally, it is called "reflection." This internal reflection is the "mysterious aperture." The aperture arises from the fire-timing of natural spiritual awareness, which is also the function of this natural awareness.

"The elixir substance arises in the mysterious aperture" is the cauldron; "the fire-timing ignites the yang furnace" is the furnace. Cauldron and furnace are two yet one: first the cauldron, then during refinement, it becomes the furnace. This is the natural spiritual awareness—the pure mind untainted by sound, form, scent, flavor, touch, or dharmas.

The *Daodejing* states: "These two emerge together but differ in name; together they are called the mysterious. Mystery upon mystery—the gateway to all wonders." Yet within this, the sequence of pre-heaven and post-heaven is inverted. One must distinguish whether it is the pre-heaven of pre-heaven or the pre-heaven of post-heaven, though in essence they are one. Through the provisional one cultivates the real, giving rise to true mercury and true lead. The entire process relies on true intention—this natural spiritual awareness, which is also the pure mind untainted by the six dusts. This will be discussed in detail later.

The latter part of this sutra mirrors the former. Beginning with "subduing the mind," Subhūti asks the Buddha: "How should one abide? How should one subdue the mind?" The Buddha answers that one should generate the mind in this manner. Generating the mind without clinging to sound, form, scent, flavor, touch, or dharmas is how one subdues and abides. Not clinging to the six dusts is purity of mind; with a pure mind, one naturally abides without attachment.

Not abiding in the six dusts is the method; not clinging to the four forms is the practice. The mind is like the dragon and tiger: only by not abiding in the six dusts can one subdue it. Once subdued, one can extinguish the four forms and abide. Abiding is immovability—this is the meaning of "generate the mind without abiding anywhere."

"I should liberate all sentient beings across the three times, yet in reality, not a single being is liberated." For if I harbor the mind to liberate others, the four forms arise. Liberating others with a sense of self entails the form of self, the form of others, and the form of lifespan in cultivating the Dao. Not only does this fail to achieve buddhahood, it also fails to achieve bodhisattvahood. Only without the mind to liberate others can one truly liberate sentient beings. Sentient beings, too, must relinquish the four forms to receive liberation and liberate themselves.

The *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind—the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment—cannot in truth be aroused by any method; its arising is entirely spontaneous and cannot be compelled by external force. Since this awakened mind cannot be aroused by any means, it likewise cannot be used to liberate others. Beings must awaken and liberate themselves, yet even in beings, the thought of self-liberation must not arise, for where there is mind, there are the four forms. Neither liberating others nor liberating oneself can be achieved through such means.

"Subhūti, what do you think? Was I liberated by Dīpaṃkara Buddha? Did I receive any dharma from him?"
"No, World-Honored One. When you met Dīpaṃkara, there was no dharma to be obtained, nor was it transmitted by him."
"Just so, just so! Had there been any dharma to obtain at that time, Dīpaṃkara would not have given me the prediction: ‘In the future, you will attain buddhahood.’" Where there is dharma to obtain, the four forms arise. At that moment, mind corresponded with mind, and true awakening arose naturally—thus the prediction of buddhahood was conferred.

The Tathāgata is without coming or going, for the dharma of non-action is neither born nor destroyed. All dharmas are without birth or extinction. Some say the Buddha attained the dharma of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, yet in truth, the Buddha attained nothing. It is as if there were something, yet in reality, there is nothing—utterly empty and void, existing in the realm of neither reality nor unreality. This is the "middle" spoken of by the sages of the Three Teachings. The middle is emptiness; the dharma abides within true emptiness, and thus there is no dharma.

All dharmas are the Buddha-dharma; all dharmas are not the Buddha-dharma, for dharmas are without coming or going, without reality or unreality. The Tathāgata speaks of "a great body," yet it is not great—it is merely called great. For once "great" is spoken, there must be a limit: ten feet is great, ten thousand feet is also great. If it reaches ten thousand feet, it is already the utmost in greatness, yet since ten thousand implies a limit, it is not truly a great body. Only that which is limitless, like empty space, is the great body.

When a bodhisattva vows to liberate sentient beings, to say, "I shall liberate beings," is no longer a bodhisattva. "I" is the form of self; "shall" is the form of others. With the four forms present, how can one be called a bodhisattva? Only where there is no dharma can one be called a bodhisattva. Departing from the four forms, utterly empty, one subdues the mind and generates a pure mind—only then may one be called a "bodhisattva."

If a bodhisattva has the mind to adorn a buddha-land, the buddha-land cannot be adorned. Only without the mind to adorn is there true adornment. "One who thoroughly understands the dharma of no-self is a bodhisattva." Where there is no self, there is no dharma—thus it is said, "there is no dharma to liberate beings." Of the four forms, the form of self is the heaviest; only without self can there be dharma, and one becomes a true bodhisattva.

The Buddha asked Subhūti: "Does the Tathāgata possess the divine eye?" The divine eye is the divine-eye penetration. "The wisdom eye?" The wisdom eye pervades the trichiliocosm. "The dharma eye?" The dharma eye illuminates past and future worlds, surpassing the wisdom eye. "The buddha eye?" The buddha eye surpasses the dharma eye; its nature is true emptiness, illuminating all without exception, perceiving first and then illuminating. Subhūti replied: "The Buddha possesses the divine eye, the wisdom eye, the dharma eye, and the buddha eye."

The Buddha further said: "In worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, the minds of all beings are fully known and seen by the Buddha." For all minds are not minds, and thus the Tathāgata "knows and sees them all." The mindless mind is fully known and seen by the Buddha.

"The past mind cannot be obtained, the future mind cannot be obtained, the present mind cannot be obtained." This encompasses the three minds. The past is recollection, an afterthought; the present is thought; the future is anticipation—none can be obtained. The original mind of beings is true emptiness, and thus cannot be obtained. The three minds are also the buddhas of the three times, belonging to the trichiliocosm. The three times arise from the mind, giving rise to recollection, deep thought, and excessive worry. Abandon these three, and all thoughts become empty—only emptiness is the buddha-mind. With these three minds, one cannot attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Only by first eliminating the past and future, then the present, does the mind become empty. This is what is meant by "subduing the mind"—it is the effort of unifying the three minds.

To give alms with the seven treasures of the trichiliocosm yields great merit, yet only when given without mind is the merit said to be abundant. With mind, it is not abundant.

The Buddha asked Subhūti: "Can the Tathāgata be seen by means of the physical body?"
"No, World-Honored One. Where there is form, there is no form; the Tathāgata cannot be seen by means of the physical body." Only where there is no form can one see him, for what the Tathāgata speaks of is the dharma-body, which cannot be seen by a form-bound body.

Again he asked: "Can the Tathāgata be seen by means of marks?"
"No, World-Honored One. Where there are marks, there are no marks. All marks are empty—only then is it the true mark. Within true emptiness, nothing is lacking. Only true emptiness can give rise to transformation." The so-called "thirty-two marks" are transformations within true emptiness.

The Buddha further told Subhūti: "The Tathāgata’s teaching of the dharma is no dharma to be taught—this is called teaching the dharma." The dharma is fundamentally empty; since there is no dharma, teaching is also not teaching. At that moment, as Subhūti listened to the Buddha’s teaching, his wisdom opened, and thus he was named "Life of Wisdom."

Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "In future ages, will there be sentient beings who, upon hearing the Buddha’s teaching of the dharma, generate faith?"

The Buddha replied: "The term 'sentient beings' is but a provisional designation. The nature of sentient beings is empty—there is not only no sentient-being nature, but also no Buddha-nature. To be identical with sentient beings is to be a sentient being; to be identical with the Buddha is to be the Buddha. One who realizes the emptiness of nature is the Buddha; one who fails to understand the emptiness of nature is a sentient being. Thus, one may be called a sentient being, or one may not. Those who comprehend this sutra and generate faith are the Buddha, not sentient beings. The Tathāgata sees all sentient beings as identical to the Buddha, yet they do not depart from being sentient beings—all is self-invited by sentient beings themselves."

Subhūti again addressed the Buddha: "When the Buddha attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, was it a case of nothing being attained?"

The Buddha said: "Just so, just so! The Tathāgata attains nothing in all dharmas. Not only anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, but even the slightest dharma in all dharmas is unattained. Only when all is utterly empty, with not a single thing grasped, is it the pure mind."

The Buddha told Subhūti: "The Buddha-dharma is equal, without high or low." Only the supreme One Vehicle is the Buddha-dharma. The Sixth Patriarch said: "The Buddha-dharma is but the One Vehicle; the other two are not true." (See the *Platform Sutra*) The Middle and Small Vehicles are not the Buddha-dharma. By relinquishing the four marks, the mind becomes pure of itself; naturally, spiritual awareness arises, inherently without great or small, high or low. All wholesome minds are the pure mind unattached to the six sense-objects. "All wholesome dharmas are the dharma of attaining anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi." There is no dharma that is the wholesome dharma. The Buddha speaks in metaphors; this profound principle must be carefully contemplated.

The Buddha told Subhūti: "In one world, there is one Mount Sumeru, also called the summit, located in the Western Regions. If one were to offer the seven treasures of Mount Sumeru, king of the three-thousand great-thousand worlds, in almsgiving, the merit would be great indeed. Yet the merit of receiving, upholding, reciting, and explaining this sutra to others does not compare to even a thousandth or ten-thousandth part of it. This sutra speaks entirely of the merit of formlessness. Since it is formless, it is identical to the Supreme Ultimate. When the mind is thus, its merit is boundless. One who is without mind unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth, and shines together with the sun and moon. Confucius said: 'What does Heaven say?' (See *Analects*, *Yang Huo*) Only by being without mind does Heaven achieve its greatness. When a person is without mind, they too are identical to Heaven—how could their merit be measured? Mencius said: 'All things are complete within me!' (See *Mencius*, *Jin Xin Shang*) For when it is extended, it pervades the six directions. If one can relinquish the three minds, extinguish the four marks, and be without mind, then their merit is of the same substance as the great void. Three thousand eight hundred worlds are encompassed in an instant—such merit cannot be calculated by words or numbers."

"Subhūti, I have no such thought as 'I shall ferry sentient beings across.' If there were sentient beings whom the Tathāgata ferried across, this would be attachment to the four marks. 'One who has a self is not the true self.' The self of the Tathāgata is not the self of the form-body. The self of the Tathāgata is empty, of the same substance as the great void. Emptiness is the self; the self is emptiness. 'Ordinary beings' are spoken of in contrast to cultivators. When the mind is truly empty, one is the Buddha. Thus it is said: 'Ordinary beings are not ordinary beings—this is called ordinary beings.'"

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can the Tathāgata be observed by means of the thirty-two marks?"

"To observe" means to look upon. "If the Tathāgata were observed by means of the thirty-two marks, then the Wheel-Turning Sage King would be the Tathāgata." The Wheel-Turning King is distinguished by gold, silver, and copper—one should not observe the Tathāgata by means of the thirty-two marks. To observe the Tathāgata by form is heterodox and cannot see the Tathāgata. Form is the yin spirit; one cannot see the Tathāgata by this. The Tathāgata is empty—hence the thirty-two marks.

"Subhūti, you should not cling to the notion of complete or incomplete marks in attaining anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If one clings to the notion of incomplete marks and arouses the mind of correct awakening, then all dharmas would be cut off. Correct awakening is the pure mind. Even if all marks are complete, though pure, they are not cut off. Attaining this and being empty like the great void, the marks and excellences are naturally complete, neither arising nor ceasing—one must not speak of the mark of extinction."

"Subhūti, if one were to offer worlds of seven treasures as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in almsgiving, and another were to empty themselves entirely, perfecting forbearance—having emptied the four marks and realized 'no self in all dharmas'—they could endure unmoved. Even if their body were dismembered, because the mind is not in the body, they would not die and would perfect forbearance. If there were a mind, even a slight injury to the body would be unbearable. The merit of such a forbearing bodhisattva is greater than that of the almsgiving bodhisattva. Because the bodhisattva does not receive blessings and merit, though performing meritorious deeds, they are unattached to marks. With a mind free from craving, this is true emptiness. Only the merit of true emptiness is the greatest."

"The Tathāgata neither comes from anywhere nor goes anywhere—hence the name Tathāgata. If someone were to say that the Tathāgata comes or goes, sits or lies down, they would not understand the dharma spoken by the Tathāgata. For the Tathāgata is utterly empty, without coming or going."

The Buddha addressed Subhūti: "If the trichiliocosm were pulverized into motes of dust, would these motes be numerous?" To pulverize into motes is to shatter even emptiness. Subhūti replied: "Exceedingly numerous." These motes arise from nothingness; their nature is fundamentally empty, and only thus can they be ground into countless billions of particles. Were they truly substantial, they could not be so shattered. The trichiliocosm of which the Tathāgata speaks also resides within the mind—it is not a world in itself. If a world were truly substantial, it would be but mountains and rivers formed by the illusory interplay of yin and yang.

"This is called the *unified appearance*, yet it is not truly a unified appearance." The unified appearance refers to the union of spirit and qi, the interdependence of mind and breath. The chaotic fusion of yin and yang, the interdependence of mind and breath—this is the unified appearance. When yin and yang meet, they coalesce. This unified appearance arises from nothingness, its essence fundamentally empty, and thus it is said to be "ineffable." Form arises from the formless, and form and formlessness merge. Yet only when neither existence nor nonexistence is established, when the mind holds neither existence nor nonexistence, can they unite as one. Its ineffability stems from this.

"Ordinary beings cling to such matters." Ordinary beings readily attach to appearances—if not to existence, then to nonexistence; if not to dharma-appearances, then to non-dharma-appearances. Thus, they cannot attain immortality. Only when neither existence nor nonexistence is established, forming the unified appearance, does one become a fully awakened golden immortal. Possessing the dharmakāya formed by the union of existence and nonexistence, one then pulverizes it into countless billions of transformation bodies. Thus, the Buddha ultimately presents the unified appearance, only to declare it "ineffable." For in truth, it is the formless unity born of existence within nothingness and nothingness within existence.

"Subhūti, people often speak of the Buddha’s teachings on the views of self, person, sentient being, and lifespan. Do you think they understand the meaning of my words?" Subhūti replied: "Such people do not understand the Buddha’s meaning." For ordinary beings interpret these "four views" as truly existent, whereas the Tathāgata speaks of view without appearance—responding to circumstances with stillness, moving in accord with stimuli, a seeing without seeing. This is the difference.

The Buddha then explained: "Those who arouse the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment and attain purity of mind should know and see thus: respond when circumstances arise, cease when they pass. One’s faith and understanding of the dharma must be the same—without generating dharma-appearances or the mind of cultivation. When the time is ripe, one responds naturally, without preconceived intent. The Tathāgata’s teaching that 'dharma-appearances are not dharma-appearances' refers to the appearance of the formless, for no views or perceptions arise.

The Buddha told Subhūti: "The merit of upholding this sutra surpasses that of almsgiving. Even if one were to fill measureless asaṃkhyeya worlds with the seven treasures and offer them in almsgiving for asaṃkhyeya kalpas since beginningless time, the merit would be immeasurable. Yet if one were to receive, uphold, recite, or expound this sutra for others, the merit would surpass even that." For one does not grasp at appearances, and the sutra itself is without the appearance of a sutra. In receiving, upholding, reciting, or expounding, one does not cling to the appearance of upholding the sutra. The mind remains empty, like movement without movement, stillness without stillness, neither empty nor non-empty. Thus, its merit is even more immeasurable.

"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew or lightning—all pass as swiftly as a glance. All immortals and buddhas are distinguished by the unconditioned dharma. Conditioned dharmas are viewed as illusory. The wondrous observation of my mind equates all dharmas to flowers in the sky. Thus, all monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and even earth-bound demons who hear the Buddha’s words rejoice greatly, believing, accepting, and practicing them.

In these thirty-two chapters, all appearances are emptied—from the four appearances to dharma-appearances and non-dharma-appearances, all are empty. Yet from nothingness arises the unified appearance, the root of heaven, earth, and all beings. Having attained this unified appearance, one must still transcend existence and nonexistence, abiding in unmoving suchness. Only then is it in accord with the dharma. This is the primordial qi, the original nature of Qian, the nameless beginning of heaven and earth, the mystery within mystery, the gateway to all wonders.

Having attained this unified appearance, one must further shatter it into countless billions of transformation bodies. Then the work is complete, and the task is finished. Scholars must contemplate this deeply." Lecture Twenty.

The inversion of Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—this "inversion and reversal" is a phrase often used in Daoist texts. Yet from ancient times, those who study the Dao have mostly failed to deeply comprehend its true meaning, thereby giving rise to heterodox interpretations. Some take heaven below and earth above as the hexagram *Earth-Heaven Peace* (*Ditian Tai*), and in human terms, consider a man yielding to a woman as inversion—thus leading to misunderstandings. In truth, these two characters hold profound significance; the entire function of Daoist cultivation lies precisely here. The transformation from the primordial to the postnatal, and the return from the postnatal to the primordial, are never separate from inversion and reversal.

From the moment of birth until the breaking of the body, the single yang line in *Qian* descends into *Kun* to become *Kan*, while the central yin line in *Kun* ascends to become *Li*—from above to below, from below to above, this is inversion. After the breaking of the body, the cultivator draws from *Kan* to fill *Li*, seeking to restore the youthful body—is this not also inversion? *Qian* is nature, *Kun* is destiny. When the single yang line in *Qian* descends into *Kun*, it becomes *Kan*; the yang within *Kan* is destiny, the primordial true yang. All that a person uses in a day, all actions and movements of the body, are the functioning of this true yang. Yet the more it is used, the more it diminishes, until the body becomes purely yin. This true yang is the metal of *Qian*, the innate nature bestowed by heaven. The postnatal physical form struggles to preserve destiny and fulfill nature. By sixteen, after the breaking of the body, by sixty-four, the true yang is entirely exhausted.

The postnatal qi from without enters the body through its orifices, lingering with the primordial qi to preserve the true yang and sustain life. Yet as it is used day by day, the true yang is depleted, and death follows. The true yang in our bodies is already deficient, though not yet exhausted, varying in degree from person to person. Those deficient must replenish it; that which has descended must be raised, which is the meaning of "drawing from Kan to fill Li"—the act of lifting upward.

This involves two layers of effort: first, absorption—since what we have used is insufficient, we must absorb the true yang from the void to replenish our own, restoring the youthful body; second, elevation—extracting the true yang sunken in *Kan* and raising it back to *Li*. Yet the yang that has descended is deeply hidden and invisible; it must be stirred by the true yang from the void, which resonates with the true yang in the Gate of Life, mutually responding until they merge and ascend. Relying solely on the body’s yang qi is ineffective and difficult to elevate, hence the need for both internal and external cultivation. Focusing solely on either inner or outer practice makes success unlikely.

The elevation of the true yang from the Gate of Life is inversion; the absorption of true yang from the void is also inversion. Foundation-building and absorption belong to the primordial within the postnatal. Since our bodies are postnatal and incomplete, what is drawn forth is thus the primordial within the postnatal. In the Great Celestial Cycle, it becomes the primordial within the primordial. In essence, they are the same; the distinction arises only from the differing states of the body.

The first step is returning to emptiness—emptiness so profound that stillness is absolute, and the true yang arrives to be absorbed. In the void, all is purely primordial; when it resonates with the body, one may feel arousal or tingling numbness. Once sensed, it becomes postnatal; after absorption, the primordial transforms into the postnatal. The true yang born in the void is a perfect, unadorned thing; when it merges with the body, they become one, hence postnatal. Relatively speaking, it becomes postnatal; in its essence, it remains primordial—this is the principle of "the primordial transforming into the postnatal."

The true yang in the void is what was received before the parents’ birth—this is the primordial ancestral qi. When the true yang resonates and essence arrives, the parents’ blood and essence envelop it, forming the embryo. This primordial ancestral qi is the original ancestral nature. What now arises in the void is the same substance; we absorb it to establish destiny, not nature. Before the parents’ birth, it is nature; now, we use it to establish destiny. Nature and destiny are the same thing, differing only in name.

At the moment of primordial conception, nature and destiny are undivided, for there is no physical form. Now, with a physical body, we call it "destiny." Master Lu Xianqian said: "Fulfilling nature depends on the realm of destiny; fulfilling destiny depends on the realm of nature." In the primordial state, they are one; from the postnatal body after breaking, we rely on absorption to restore the youthful body and thereby establish destiny—yet nature and destiny remain one. This is what is truly meant by inversion: destiny inverted is nature, nature inverted is destiny. That which dwells in the Heavenly Valley is nature; that which dwells in the Responsive Valley and Spirit Valley is destiny—nature and destiny are one.

The phrase "inversion and reversal" appears often in texts. When one reaches the state of no-mind, the primordial establishes destiny, which is then used to cultivate nature. In the boundless obscurity of chaos, seeing nature is seeing destiny. Thus it is said: "Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny."

As stated in the *Yi Jing*’s “Shuo Gua”: “nature and destiny are originally one,” hence the phrase “to reach destiny.” Nature and destiny are but one inversion and one reversal. From the perspective of nature, it is “prior to Heaven, and Heaven cannot contravene it”—the primordial qi gives birth to Heaven, and since Heaven is born of this, it cannot contravene it. From the perspective of destiny, it is “posterior to Heaven, yet in accord with Heaven’s timing”—once Heaven exists, this qi lingers in the void, giving rise to the myriad things in due time, hence “in accord with Heaven’s timing.” The so-called “Heaven cannot contravene” and “in accord with Heaven’s timing” both refer to this single qi of the Supreme Ultimate within the void. Prior to Heaven and posterior to Heaven invert and reverse one another; the myriad things arise from this. The generation of the myriad things is posterior to Heaven, while their original substance is prior to Heaven—these two are one.

Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, are all encompassed by this qi, yet nothing can be seen or heard of it, thus it is said: “Its greatness has no exterior; its smallness has no interior.” As Ancestor Lü said: “In its vastness, it embraces the cosmos; in its minuteness, it hides within a mustard seed.” This is precisely the reason.

The nature and destiny of the human body are likewise one. Thus, the Daoist texts say: “Nature is established by destiny; destiny is completed by nature.” Before we are born, there is no such thing as nature; only after the physical body exists do we know that where there is this thing called destiny, there is nature—hence “nature is established by destiny.” Yet our destiny is formed by receiving true yang at the moment of conception—hence “destiny is completed by nature.” These two are in truth one body and cannot be separated. Thus, in cultivating nature, destiny is inherently present; in cultivating destiny, nature is inherently present.

The supreme vehicle of the primordial Great Dao in cultivation lies entirely in emptiness and quiescence, wholly natural and spontaneous. This so-called emptiness and quiescence reside entirely in chaos. To reach the state of chaos is to return to the prior-Heaven. The crux lies in whether one can return to the void—if one can return to the void, one can naturally attain chaos. Whether the primordial qi can be felt in the body depends on whether one can achieve emptiness and quiescence. Only when one attains emptiness and quiescence can the qi be felt in the body and yang arise. Once yang has arisen, if one can remain in emptiness and quiescence without stirring, one can retain the yang qi in the body without loss. Otherwise, destiny cannot be established, and nature will also be lost. Therefore, in cultivating the primordial Great Dao, one must take emptiness and quiescence as the foundation—both the heart must be empty and the body must be still.

If one can be empty at all times, the true yang of the primordial qi can arise at all times. If one can be still at all times, the primordial true yang can arise and reach the body at all times. Thus, the first step in Daoist cultivation is the stillness of both body and mind, whereby the spirit’s awareness naturally generates true yang, which can then be gathered and preserved without loss. Otherwise, if it does not adhere to the body, it will adhere to the mind. Though yang may arise, it cannot be gathered; even if gathered, it will be lost in an instant and cannot be preserved.

This involves the question of whether the source of water is clear or turbid. Only when one attains emptiness and quiescence is the source clear; otherwise, it is turbid. The clear is genuine, while the turbid is false. When the true yang from the void reaches the body, it stirs the Gate of Destiny, and the yang organ rises—this is the clear. When the mind harbors images and the yang organ rises, this is the turbid. When yang first arises, it is originally clear, but if the mind becomes fearful or the hands and feet flustered, the clear immediately turns turbid, for the moment an image arises in the mind, it becomes turbid. Once turbid, it cannot be used and cannot be gathered. If one fails to distinguish carefully and gathers this turbid qi, the consequences will be immediate: headaches, heart vexation, red eyes, and other ailments will arise, for the true yang has transformed into ministerial fire, which flames upward and causes these illnesses. But if both body and mind are still, and one gathers the true yang in tranquility, the source of water remains clear, the body feels light and at ease, and the mind and spirit are serene—this is the difference.

Water and fire are originally one: water contains fire, and fire contains water. When body and mind are clear and still, and one gathers the clear, what is obtained is the metal within water. If one fails to do so and gathers the turbid, what is obtained is ministerial fire. A hair’s breadth of difference leads to a thousand miles of error. Thus, one must rely on natural spirit-awareness, whereby body and mind can remain still and unmoving. Otherwise, body and mind will separate, and one will cling to images.

When we first awaken, the water is originally clear, but the moment we awaken, it transforms into the posterior-Heaven, and the source of water becomes turbid. The alchemical texts’ saying “the medicine has aged and cannot be used” refers precisely to this. Once spirit and qi embrace and one awakens, why do they immediately separate and change? It all depends on whether one’s daily work in refining the heart is mature. If thoughts cannot be stilled, even if spirit and qi momentarily embrace, the moment one awakens, thoughts arise, and the clear turns turbid—this is where the work lies.

For beginners, who have just commenced their cultivation, it is naturally difficult to maintain the perpetual embrace of spirit and qi. A method is needed to refine it—this is the martial fire of the water clock. The water clock was an ancient device where a bronze vessel dripped water, marked to measure time. The phrase “listening to the water’s sound and counting the clock’s marks” refers to the method of listening to the breath. When spirit and qi embrace, yang arises and one awakens, but as soon as thoughts stir, one employs the work of listening to the breath. By slightly lengthening the breath and listening with the heart, thoughts can be stilled and remain unmoving. This is what is meant by applying the martial fire of the water clock during the gathering process.

With this method, clarity naturally arises, and the water becomes clear once more. This method of stabilizing the mind is indeed most essential. However, it must be applied the moment a thought begins to stir; if several thoughts have already arisen, it cannot be used—or if used, it will be ineffective. This martial fire of the water clock may also be employed in daily life to still the mind. If one listens to the breath at all times, even ordinary breathing can be heard. Ordinary breathing is the breath of formlessness; by this method, thoughts may be severed even as they arise.

We who study the Dao are all those who cultivate while managing worldly affairs. If we cannot detach from mundane duties, we cannot hear the breath except in stillness. The "martial fire of the water clock" is spoken of in contrast to the "cultivating fire of steaming warmth." As the saying goes: *"The civil refines, the martial restrains."* Refining is harmonizing; restraining is halting. When stabilized in emptiness, one may faintly sense a warm, misty white qi lingering outside the nostrils—this is the civil refining, the cultivating fire of steaming warmth. To call it "steaming" is to liken it to the heat rising from a steamer, suffusing the body with a tingling numbness, as if on the verge of sweat yet not sweating. When yang arises, holding fast to stillness and forgetting all else is the cultivating fire of steaming warmth. At the moment before yang stirs, counting the water clock’s marks to still the mind is the martial fire—the martial fire of the water clock. Thus, the martial comes first, the civil follows, and at the end, the fire is withdrawn. For beginners in cultivation, there are no more than these three steps: martial, civil, and cessation.

After yang stirs in stillness and one rises to gather it, one must move slowly to prevent the stirring of emotions and thoughts. Upon rising, one should listen to the breath to preserve the clarity of the water’s source. Those who do not understand the martial fire of the water clock mistake it for mere breath-counting. In daily practice, if one seeks to still the mind with martial fire, one must not rely solely on counting breaths—rather, one must listen with the ears, not count with the mind. This distinction cannot be overlooked.

The first step for the student is to still both body and mind. To awaken with body and mind still, one must first sleep with body and mind still. As the *Canon* says: *"In sleep, spirit and qi embrace; upon waking, one attends to presence and absence."* That is, in sleep, spirit and qi embrace, and one remains alert, knowing the living zi and living wu. If one cannot be still in sleep, stillness upon waking will be even harder to achieve. Thus, for beginners, sleep practice is most essential.

We are all novices in cultivation and should devote special care to sleep practice. When sleeping, one must not dwell on the past or worry about the future. As soon as one lies down, one should fall asleep, naturally achieving *"in sleep, spirit and qi embrace."* There is a way to test this: if one falls asleep the moment one’s head touches the pillow, that night’s dreams will be peaceful and the spirit serene. But if one lies in bed lost in thought for a long time before sleeping, dreams will be chaotic and the spirit muddled. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must first tame the demon of sleep.

The thoughts one has before sleep become the dreams one has during sleep. Many thoughts lead to many dreams; few thoughts, to few dreams. The dreams of Tang Sanzang in *Journey to the West* are dharmic manifestations, not mere dreams. When we sleep, if we begin to think the moment our head touches the pillow and cannot fall asleep, we must employ an expedient method: draw a circle ○ and gaze at it with an intention that is neither too strong nor too weak; or imagine a circle ○ lingering outside the nostrils, holding it there with an intention that is neither too strong nor too weak. This will still the mind and allow one to sleep. With practice, this becomes habitual, and thoughts will naturally cease. Mastery comes only through repetition and habit.

When first falling asleep, one must focus the mind without distraction. Between intention and non-intention, unite spirit and qi in the emptiness outside the nostrils. Then spirit and qi will embrace, yang will return, and awareness will stir naturally. This is called *"when the time comes, the spirit knows"*—as soon as yang stirs, one awakens. Upon waking, one should immediately sit up and practice. If one remains lying down, one will either sink into torpor or grow restless. Torpor means yang has reverted to the postnatal; restlessness means it has been lost. One must rise slowly and sit up, applying the martial fire of the water clock. When sitting up, one must stabilize, and once stabilized, forget all else. Whether the legs are crossed or not is of no consequence. However, clothing and the like must never disturb the external kidneys—this is most critical and must not be neglected.

**Lecture Twenty-One: Fulfilling Nature to Reach Destiny is Called the Celestial Origin**

The Utmost Simplicity and Ease of the Supreme Vehicle of Chan

All aspects of the precelestial Great Dao—the supreme vehicle’s method, including its firing times and other details—have now been thoroughly expounded. Though some minor points may remain unaddressed, the essentials are complete. By diligently applying these teachings, the practitioner may penetrate all truths. I had intended to proceed to the *Wuzhen Pian*, but since the *Huangting Jing* has already been discussed, the *Wuzhen Pian* should be readily comprehended, and thus will not be further expounded. Today’s conclusion marks the end of this lecture series. Last year’s opening coincided with the winter solstice, and today’s closing falls on the Buddha’s Enlightenment Day—both occasions arising from the convergence of human affairs and celestial timing. Only afterward did I realize that the lectures began on the winter solstice, and now conclude on the Buddha’s Enlightenment Day, a felicitous alignment unanticipated beforehand. This reveals the workings of Heaven’s intent, urging us to seize the moment with resolve.

Today, I shall briefly distinguish between the Celestial Origin (tianyuan) and Human Origin (renyuan) methods, as well as the ease and difficulty of cultivating the higher and lower virtues, thereby bringing these lectures to a close.

The contents of the Celestial and Human Origin elixir methods have already been addressed above. Li Xianhanxu’s *Nine Layers of Heart Refinement Discourse* describes the Human Origin method, which requires the practitioner to forcibly apply personal intent in cultivation, gradually refining it into true intent. In the "Second Layer of Heart Refinement," it is said that postnatal humans, burdened by excessive thoughts, cannot directly enter profound stillness or penetrate the mysterious aperture. The method lies in wielding the sword and forming the mudra, using one’s intent to dissolve awareness. When yang arises and solidifies, intent must guide it to the coccyx, ascending to the Niwan Palace.

The Human Origin method begins with intent guiding the process. At the outset, one focuses on the point one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel, directing the breath there with inhalation and exhalation. Thus it is said: *"It halts behind the navel hall, before the Gate of Life, within a circle of emptiness."* And again: *"My heart rests here, and I inwardly observe it."* On the in-breath, intent directs it inward; on the out-breath, intent welcomes it, halting at the external point one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Once the internal qi congeals behind the navel, the exhalation is further directed outward through the nose, stabilizing externally. This "guiding of intent with inhalation and exhalation" first unites the mundane intent and breath of the postnatal. Once united, they merge into primordial chaos, then circulate within the bounds of the compass and square. The "compass and square" refer to the Golden Crucible, while "square and circle" denote the apertures of square and round as previously discussed. After congealing, the heart-spirit stabilizes in the external emptiness beyond the nose. When yang arises, intent guides it to the coccyx, ascending to the Niwan Palace—this is the work of refining essence into qi, distinct from the Celestial Origin method.

The Celestial Origin is purely a practice of emptiness, free from arbitrary intent. While intent may arise, true intent does not. The Human Origin begins with deliberate effort, extending the postnatal destiny. Only after completing the destiny work does one cultivate the nature. Though this may seem easier initially, the later resolution of nature is far more difficult, for the source of water is impure.

Those who begin with the Human Origin must ultimately undertake nine years of wall-facing practice to refine spirit and return to emptiness, achieving true emptiness and resolving nature. Only after nine years will their nature become perfectly round and luminous. Daoists speak of beginning with the refinement of form—form being the body. Those who cultivate the Celestial Origin start with the true emptiness of form refinement, thereby attaining both nature and destiny. The Human Origin first refines form to prolong life, then cultivates destiny. After completing the Great Cycle, three years of "nursing" practice follow, after which the spirit becomes efficacious. Combined with the hundred-day foundation-building and nine years of wall-facing, the entire process requires thirteen years.

At the outset, personal intent serves as the premise, employing single-minded focus to generate transformation within, such as opening the pass and expanding the aperture—all guided by intent. Intent, the master of the postnatal physical form, is primordial essence before birth and becomes intent after birth. When intent moves, spirit, qi, and essence move with it. If intent is concentrated, the postnatal essence, qi, and spirit naturally unite—this pertains to destiny work.

As for the work of nature, nature is inherently empty. Without first returning to emptiness, one cannot perceive nature. The Human Origin first resolves destiny, then nature. Only during the three years of nursing and after nine years of wall-facing can one shatter emptiness, a sequence distinct from the Celestial Origin.

The Celestial Origin is the supreme vehicle shared by the Three Teachings, embodying *"exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny."* Principle refers to the generative principles of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, born from the li-qi within the Supreme Ultimate. The character *li* (理) is interchangeable with *li* (礼, ritual), as the ancients used *li* (礼) where we now use *li* (理). Examples include Confucius inquiring about ritual from Laozi and *"restraining the self to return to ritual."* The cosmos’ generative transformations arise from the function of li-qi. Humans are conceived through the influence of li-qi. This qi is destiny in Heaven and nature in humans. Heaven bestows it as destiny; humans receive it as nature. Principle and destiny are one! Though originally an empty body, it is the root of all diversity. By single-mindedly cultivating the One, body and heart become still, inner and outer both empty. From this, a single point of li-qi may be regenerated, gathered, and sealed—thus both nature and destiny are attained. This achievement may reduce the need for three or nine years of practice.

At the outset of refining the self, one tempers the form with true emptiness. After the great celestial cycle, the spirit may depart and attain spiritual communion—this is the attainment of nature, with destiny inherent within. Thus it is said: *"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny."* Nature is the li-qi within the Supreme Ultimate. To fulfill one’s nature is to fulfill the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.

The Supreme Ultimate is undifferentiated; when it moves, it generates yang—this is li-qi, the root of Heaven. When it is still, it generates yin, dividing into the Two Modes, the root of Earth. From Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate, from yin-yang to the Five Phases, the myriad things are transformed and born. Therefore, to fulfill one’s own nature is to fulfill the nature of others; to fulfill the nature of others is to fulfill the nature of things; to fulfill the nature of things is to assist in Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturance. Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are fundamentally one body, sharing the same root as the self. Mencius said: *"The myriad things are all complete within me."*

The primordial li-qi is inherently possessed by humans, but it is constrained by temperament and obscured by worldly desires, scattering midway. The practice of the Dao lies solely in recovering this scattered li-qi. Though the streams of the Three Teachings diverge in myriad ways, their source is rooted in this, and they are not different.

Buddhism speaks only of nature and not of destiny, for when nature is attained, destiny is naturally attained—this is not a matter of neglect. Yet one must not mistake the cultivation of nature for the refinement of the yin spirit. Refining the yin spirit is the nurturing of the postnatal consciousness, enabling it to attain spiritual communion. However, being yin, it remains subject to arising and ceasing; lacking the work of returning to emptiness, it does not attain the primordial nature. Those who focus single-mindedly on nurturing the consciousness without uniting it with qi achieve only the spiritual communion of the yin spirit, a result inferior to the cultivation of the Heavenly Origin. The distinction in levels must be understood.

The practice of the supreme vehicle of the primordial Dao—the method of the Heavenly Origin—begins with returning to emptiness, prioritizing the refinement of the heart. The work of refining the self is boundless, for differences in individuals’ capacities, wisdom, and mental ground lead to variations in speed. Those with deep roots and great merit find refinement easy, requiring little time; otherwise, it is difficult and protracted.

Those who practice the method of the Human Origin first engage in foundation-laying, beginning with the generation and acquisition of the medicine. By uniting one’s intention with the qi of breath, the medicine is generated—this is the postnatal medicine. All that is gathered and attained remains within the postnatal, which is the work of foundation-laying. The refinement of the self comes afterward, requiring two additional steps.

Those who practice the method of the Heavenly Origin to cultivate the primordial Dao need only the single step of refining the self; all other practices proceed and are attained naturally, without deliberate effort. The Buddhist cultivation of prajñā, the Daoist supreme vehicle, and the Confucian *"exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, to reach destiny"* are all thus, without distinction.

For those cultivating the Human Origin, the initial work is easy, but the final stage is difficult. Some practice for many years without attaining ascension, all due to insufficient cultivation of nature. The *"untrammeled, weightless"* superior elixir method described in Bai Yuchan’s *Disquisition on Delusions* refers to this Heavenly Origin great elixir. Its method is simple and may be completed in a year, transmitted through the heart-mind.

The middle-grade elixir method pertains to the Human Origin, taking three years to complete. The lower-grade elixir method can only dispel illness and does not extend life; its duration of practice is uncertain, with no guarantee of attainment. The Human Origin returns from the postnatal to the primordial, while the Heavenly Origin is purely primordial.

Since ancient times, those cultivating the Heavenly Origin have been many, while those practicing the Human Origin have been few. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the Human Origin flourished among Daoists, though Chan practitioners continued to refine the primordial, leading to mutual criticism with Buddhists. By the Yuan dynasty, Wang Chongyang’s emergence revived the Heavenly Origin Dao, its content largely aligned with Buddhism, leading some to claim the Heavenly Origin elixir method originated from Buddhism. In truth, the supreme vehicle is the same across the Three Teachings, fundamentally undivided. Thus, the principles of the Heavenly Origin resonate with Confucian classics and Buddhist scriptures, which may be consulted for mutual verification.

The Daoist scriptures handed down from antiquity all expound the Heavenly Origin, differing from the Daoist texts of the Tang and Song. The ignorant have debated their superiority, but this arises from a lack of deep inquiry. The Heavenly Origin Dao is certain to yield success, which is why Bai Yuchan asserted that this path is assured and this elixir is certain to form. As long as body and heart are still, a natural spiritual awareness will govern the firing process without error.

The Human Origin is otherwise: when false intentions are not exhausted and true intention has not arisen, the firing process requires constant vigilance against danger. Thus, it is difficult to practice and difficult to complete. Qing dynasty Daoists regarded the Heavenly Origin as pure and the Human Origin as grafting, requiring supplementation when true yang was insufficient. Those cultivating the Human Origin rely on their own heart-mind to govern the process, often forcing it. The Heavenly Origin, however, is purely natural: body and heart are still and pure, non-doing yet all-accomplishing. A single spirit and a single qi govern it, not one’s own actions.

Those cultivating the Human Origin, after obtaining the great elixir, must further attain the mysterious pearl—the pearl of nature—to complete the final work of nature. In the postscripts to the *Three Commentaries on the "Awakening to Reality"*, the *Authentic Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states that the refinement of the self follows foundation-laying.

After nursing the great elixir, one then obtains the mysterious pearl—this is the separate cultivation of nature and life, first completing life and then completing nature. As for the Way of the Heavenly Origin, to attain nature is to attain life; wherever nature is attained, life is attained there as well—these two are one. If one focuses solely on the work of the Human Origin without advancing to the Heavenly Origin, this is what Ancestor Lü called "a fool whose lifespan equals heaven’s."

Those who cultivate the Human Origin attain the five spiritual penetrations during the three-year nursing period. Those who cultivate the Heavenly Origin, however, vary in timing according to their root capacity and merit. Those of the highest root capacity may attain it even before the foundation-laying is complete; those of weaker capacity will surely attain it during the foundation-laying and warming-nurturing phase. After attaining the penetrations, one must further undergo the great celestial cycle—this is where the Heavenly Origin and Human Origin differ.

During the Qing dynasty, various schools of learning flourished, and many innovations emerged in the methods of elixir refinement. Those who achieved the elixir and became immortals were not few, leading some to regard the Heavenly Origin as the divine elixir and the Human Origin as mere alchemical practice, with the cultivation of the Heavenly Origin as true Daoist practice. They held that those of superior root capacity could cultivate it directly, while those of slightly lesser capacity must first cultivate the Human Origin before advancing to the Heavenly Origin—this was their teaching.

The Buddhist view, however, holds that all ordinary beings can cultivate the Heavenly Origin, that only the Heavenly Origin is the path of the Great Awakened Golden Immortal, and that it alone ensures one’s attainment is permanent, leading to Dao. Those who cultivate the Human Origin remain within the ranks of the ten kinds of immortals described in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, still bound within the three realms and unable to transcend them. Only by learning Buddhism—becoming a Great Awakened Golden Immortal—can one transcend the three realms and remain indestructible for endless kalpas. Thus it is said, "There is only one vehicle; the other two are not true." The other two refer to the pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas, attained through the cultivation of the Human Origin.

From the first to the seventh chapter of *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong’s cultivation is that of the Heavenly Origin. From the Mountain of Two Frontiers to the end, Tang Sanzang’s cultivation is that of the Human Origin advancing to the Heavenly Origin—far more difficult than Sun Wukong’s. Only after passing the Flaming Mountains can deluded intent return to true intent; only after subduing the rhinoceros demon can nature be completed. The ninety-nine trials arise from errors in the firing process, making success all the more difficult. Thus, the cultivation of the Heavenly Origin is sudden and complete, while that of the Human Origin is gradual—another point of difference between the two.

The method of cultivating the Heavenly Origin begins with emptying one’s nature, that is, the emptiness of the two natures. For nature is divided into good nature and non-good nature. The Buddha taught that "natures are also the same"—these are all postnatal natures. The prenatal nature is the original ancestral nature; only by emptying the postnatal nature can one attain the prenatal nature. The original ancestral nature is true awakening.

Those who cultivate the Human Origin first eliminate the non-good nature, yet still retain the good nature. Only after nine years of wall-gazing do they eliminate the good nature, achieving the emptiness of the two natures and thus true awakening. The Buddha spoke of the "mind-generated body," a term of vast scope. Our physical form is a "mind-generated" body. When male and female unite, a single point of intent arises—this is emotion and thought. As emotion and thought interact, they attract external principle-qi to the body, giving rise to a human form. When the two emotions reach the peak of joy, thought dissolves into formlessness, forming a purely yin body—this is true intent. This intent can stir the purely yang qi, condensing it into an embryo. This is the ordinary process of human birth. Those who cultivate the Dao reverse this process to become immortals, attaining the dharmakāya. The circumstances are broadly similar, differing only in whether one cultivates the Human or Heavenly Origin.

Those who cultivate the Human Origin rely primarily on focused intent, using intent to guide qi to a point one inch and three fen below the navel, causing spirit and qi to merge and condense into a single mass of qi. At this point, deluded intent is exhausted, and true intent returns. Through true intent and this mass of qi, one attracts true yang to the body, condensing it into the dharmakāya—this is the "mind-generated body" of the Human Origin.

Those who cultivate the Heavenly Origin, however, take as their first step the elimination of deluded intent. Thus, by returning to emptiness, they attain true intent, which can then attract external true yang to condense into the dharmakāya. From the outset, they do not employ deluded intent, making their path more direct than that of the Human Origin—this is the "mind-generated body" of the Heavenly Origin. Thus, whether ordinary body or dharmakāya, all are generated by intent, all by true intent—this is their commonality.

Ridding oneself of deluded intent is exceedingly difficult. This deluded intent is the Bull Demon King in *Journey to the West*. The Bull Demon King was originally the great white ox of Snow Mountain, for the ox represents kun earth and also intent. When intent departs from truth, it becomes delusion, and the ox becomes a demon king. Returning delusion to truth transforms it back into the white ox. The same applies to intent: from delusion it becomes a demon, from truth it becomes a buddha. True intent turning into deluded intent is demonic; deluded intent returning to true intent is buddhahood.

To subdue the Bull Demon King, one must first encircle him with the vajras, signifying the attainment of the qian metal qi, which alone can return delusion to truth. Only by returning delusion to truth can one attain the vajra body, indestructible for endless kalpas. In *Journey to the West*, the vajras appear only once—this is the most crucial point to observe.

Nezha the Third Prince is the Great Spirit of the Three Altars and Sea Assembly, representing the spirit of consciousness within the heart. Only when the spirit of consciousness returns to the primordial spirit does true intent arise. Beheading him only to have another head grow in its place illustrates the human mind—thoughts arise ceaselessly, unsevered. His mouth spewing lotus blossoms and his crown emitting azure smoke signify that true intent remains unstained amidst the mire of delusion; even within deluded intent, shedding delusion allows a return to truth. Binding him with the demon-taming rope through his nostrils—where the nose is the central mountain of the body, earth, and intent—demonstrates the return of intent-earth to truth, thus transforming delusion back into truth. When deluded intent returns to true intent, true yin and true yang meet, enabling the acquisition of the Plantain Fan to cross the Flaming Mountains.

For those cultivating the human elixir, only after traversing the great celestial cycle does true intent emerge; refining the self and completing nature both follow the great celestial cycle. First building the foundation to obtain the elixir, then refining the self to complete nature—this sequence in human-elixir cultivation has its own rationale. Considering the rarity of obtaining a human body and encountering the great Dao, and how life is as fleeting as a candle in the wind, if one does not first build the foundation to prolong life, should death unexpectedly arrive during cultivation, one’s aspirations would go unfulfilled, leading to a life of vain dreams—how could regret not follow? Thus, one should first use techniques to extend life, then employ the Dao to refine nature. Building the foundation first stabilizes the physical form; once the foundation is secure, preserving a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years allows wholehearted cultivation to complete one’s nature. Extending life requires action, hence it is called "technique." Yet when deluded intent is not fully dispelled and true intent not yet attained, the foundation cannot be firm, for the heart’s refinement remains impure. To illustrate: encountering a beautiful woman in a secluded chamber or suddenly obtaining gold at dusk—those with weak resolve cannot remain unmoved, and their elixir foundation is ruined. Those cultivating the human elixir, prone to the flaw of haste leading to failure, may find direct cultivation of the celestial elixir more straightforward. This marks another distinction between celestial and human elixir cultivation.

For those practicing the primordial great Dao and celestial elixir methods, before refining the self, one must dispel deluded intent, returning delusion to truth so that intent-earth is attained, then expand and magnify it. Transforming ordinary breath into true breath and the spirit of consciousness into the primordial spirit naturally awakens spiritual awareness, enabling the completion of both nature and life. At the inception of prenatal destiny, there was but a single principle-qi; in the postnatal state, it divides into three and transforms into five, arising in profusion. Before the body’s birth, only principle-qi existed, and principle-qi was still a thing; before the Supreme Ultimate stirred, there was nothing—it was an empty body. Only by returning to the formless state of the Non-Ultimate does true emptiness arise. Thus, one must gather the five phases to assemble the three families, unite the three families into the two modes, return to the Supreme Ultimate, and revert to the Non-Ultimate to return to the root and restore life.

The work of building the foundation involves returning the five phases to the three families; traversing the great celestial cycle involves returning the two modes to the Supreme Ultimate; and the final return to emptiness involves reverting the Supreme Ultimate to the Non-Ultimate. This stage encompasses refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness. For those cultivating the celestial elixir, when refining essence into qi, it includes refining spirit and qi to merge with primordial essence; when refining qi into spirit, it encompasses refining essence to merge with primordial spirit; when refining spirit into emptiness, it involves uniting essence, qi, and spirit with emptiness. Thus, the three are interconnected—one in three, three in one.

True intent is the Yellow Dame; yellow is the color of the center, and the dame embodies compassionate heart, representing kun earth and true emptiness. Through her mediation and union, the three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—are harmonized by true intent, naturally coalescing to form the elixir. Moreover, the spirit in the heart is the sun, the qi in the body is the moon, and the central true intent is the star; with true intent present, the sun and moon naturally conjoin to form the elixir. The *Book of Changes*, a Confucian text on the Dao, combines the characters for sun and moon to form *yi* (change); Buddhism elucidates the principle of illuminating the mind and seeing nature by combining sun and moon to form *ming* (brightness), akin to Daoism’s *dan* (elixir)—all converge in union. The essence lies in merging, for union naturally achieves truth.

Yet to attain true intent, one must first return to emptiness. Laozi said: "Attain utmost emptiness, abide in profound stillness." Letting go of all entanglements, forgetting both body and mind, and persisting in practice will naturally return delusion to truth, yielding true intent. Utmost emptiness and profound stillness are interlinked—only by attaining the extreme of emptiness can one abide in profound stillness; without utmost emptiness, stillness cannot be profound. The *Great Learning* states: "Only after stabilizing can one attain stillness." If stillness is not achieved even in stability, further effort is needed to attain motionless stillness. Primordial true yang arises only through emptiness and stillness. The *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: "From emptiness arises white snow; from tranquility grows the yellow sprout." Yellow is earth; from earth, the sprout arises—this is primordial true lead, born of true intent. White snow is the same substance; lead is qian metal, inherently white, as in "white qian, black kun." Being primordial and luminous, it is called "white snow." White snow arises from emptiness, the yellow sprout grows in tranquility.

When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness becomes profound, the false returns to the true. The acquired spirit fades, and the primordial spirit emerges; spirit and qi naturally unite. The medicine is born, and the mysterious aperture likewise arises.

True intent is the natural spiritual awareness; the firing process, governed by this natural awareness, will not err. If the false intent presides, the firing process will often go awry. The methods of human-origin and celestial-origin elixir formation are largely the same; the difference lies solely in the firing process. The celestial-origin follows nature, while the human-origin involves deliberate effort. Thus, the duration of cultivation, the magnitude of attainment, and the fruition achieved differ greatly.

Yet the intent employed in the human-origin method is also an "intent without intent," not false intent. If false intent is used, it becomes deviant fire, which not only fails to achieve the Dao but may also cause illness—this, too, must be understood.

Those who cultivate the human-origin method open the passes and expand the apertures with intent; establish fetal breathing with intent; and guide the river chariot with intent. Those who cultivate the celestial-origin method proceed differently, allowing everything to unfold naturally without imposing intent. All actions—opening passes, expanding apertures, and the like—occur spontaneously.

Once refinement of the self is perfected, the foundation is firmly established, and no separate foundational work is needed. This marks another distinction between celestial-origin and human-origin cultivation.

In the pursuit of the Dao, humans are divided into those of superior virtue and those of inferior virtue: the former are those who cultivate as virginal youths, the latter those who cultivate after the body has been broken. Those of superior virtue, having never broken the body, retain primordial true essence and true qi within, possessing no transformed physical essence. Thus, their celestial authenticity is abundant, and their desires are shallow.

The acquired spirit in humans is a stray spark of the great yang, ever seeking to depart. Only primordial qi can restrain it. Since primordial qi is present to control this acquired spirit, it does not stray outward, and the seven emotions and six desires of the posterior heaven do not become excessive.

As for those of inferior virtue whose bodies have been broken, their primordial qi has already stirred and entered the Gate of Life, transforming into physical essence that constantly leaks outward. The acquired spirit, unrestrained, becomes agitated, leading to many cravings and a dull spirit.

The purpose of Dao cultivation is to restore primordial spirit and primordial qi to subdue the acquired spirit. In those of superior virtue, primordial spirit and qi remain within; when active, it is the acquired spirit, when still, the primordial spirit—far surpassing those whose bodies have been broken.

Thus, those of superior virtue may achieve the Dao in a single year, having already established a foundation. They need only return to emptiness. Daily, they remain in a state of effortless ease, allowing body and mind to move naturally, practicing non-action that accomplishes all. By aligning their own emptiness with the emptiness of heaven and earth, they can spontaneously shed the mortal coil and ascend as spirit, without needing additional effort.

Those whose bodies have been broken must first establish the foundation, then practice non-action—far more difficult than for those of superior virtue. The latter need only employ the work of "forgetting," forgetting both body and mind, entering primordial chaos. Spirit and qi become clear, returning to emptiness and merging with the undifferentiated, naturally achieving success.

On Mount Emei, there was once a thirteen-year-old girl named Song who daily stood outside her door, gazing at the sky. Through long practice, she attained the Dao. Her primordial spirit and qi remained within, merging her own spirit and qi with those of the great void, thus completing her cultivation. This was due to her great karmic capacity, having come with vows. Her actions unconsciously aligned with the Dao, cultivating without cultivating, naturally achieving the Dao.

Those who cultivate the celestial-origin great elixir restore the virginal body. After ten months of gentle nurturing, they continue with the virginal-body method of true cultivation, aligning their own emptiness with the emptiness of heaven and earth. By the time they refine the self, false thoughts and intentions have already been purified, so they need only practice returning to emptiness to succeed.

Those who cultivate the human-origin method, however, have not fully dispelled false thoughts nor fully restored true mind, and cannot proceed so directly.

For those who cultivate the celestial-origin great Dao, every moment—whether moving, dwelling, sitting, or lying down—is cultivation. By emptying the heart, the belly naturally fills. As Zhang Sanfeng said, "Play and frolic—all is cultivation." In play, they cultivate unknowingly, and the Dao is achieved.

Those of deep karmic roots may establish the foundation in just one or two years, then add the work of gentle nurturing. Choosing a secluded mountain forest, they practice the work of equanimity in stillness and forgetting. Thereafter, they focus solely on forgetting, and the Dao is naturally attained.

Bai Yuchan spoke of "achievement in one year," excluding the time spent refining the self: a hundred days to establish the foundation, ten months for the great celestial cycle—combining these makes a year, hence "achievement in one year."

Obtaining the elixir does not require much time; with perfect refinement of the self, the elixir can be obtained in an instant. Those cultivating the human-origin method, however, require thirteen years. For the celestial-origin method, only the refinement of the self is timeless; the speed of success varies with karmic capacity. The key lies in unwavering faith—sooner or later, achievement is certain.

Faith is the mother of the Dao’s source and merit. With deep, unshaken faith, even those of shallow karmic roots will one day achieve greatness—though the time required may differ slightly.

The merit of three thousand and eight hundred deeds must be fulfilled by cultivators. Yet one must not cling rigidly to method. If the aspiration to universally ferry beings is held, a single thought can fulfill the vow.

In former times, when Master Zhongli transmitted to Ancestor Lü the method of refining the earthly-origin elixir, the earthly-origin was a tangible, material alchemical practice—namely, the art of transmuting base metals into gold and silver. Ancestor Lü said, “This would harm people five hundred years hence; I shall not do it.” Master Zhongli replied, “Five hundred years from now, each will have their own karmic conditions. Though the substance may decay, it will not obstruct their affairs, and one may reclaim it in advance. Yet your single thought of not wishing to harm those five hundred years hence fulfills the three thousand and eight hundred merits within this very thought.” This serves as proof: one must not cling rigidly to a single view but must indeed accomplish the three thousand and eight hundred virtuous deeds. When the earthly-origin elixir is refined, it can transmute stone into gold and, when ingested, confer the attainment of earthly immortality. To become a celestial immortal, one must further cultivate from the stage of earthly immortality. The earthly-origin transforms tangible, material substances into intangible, immaterial ones, and moreover produces wealth; thus, only those with the requisite karmic fortune can undertake its refinement. Formerly, Ancestor Zhang transmitted this method to Shen Wansan, for Shen shared the same birth year, month, and day as the Ming sovereign Zhu Hongwu. Zhu’s destiny was to become the Son of Heaven, while Shen’s was to be the wealthiest man in the realm—hence the transmission of the earthly-origin elchemical method. When the earthly-origin elixir nears completion, mountain spirits and demonic entities often come to seize it; therefore, only those of great fortune can refine it. Even if refined, they may not succeed, and even if successful, they may not enjoy its benefits. In the cultivation of the human-origin, celestial demons may also come to disturb the practitioner, but in the celestial-origin, this does not occur. For the celestial-origin begins with the refinement of inherent nature, and when the pearl of nature is perfectly luminous, it becomes a purely yang substance, capable of subduing all yin and malevolent forces—thus, demons and spirits all conceal themselves and avoid it. Only when passing the great celestial cycle do the yin demons accumulated over one’s kalpas appear before one; yet if one remains unmoved in heart, they vanish in an instant, and all demons retreat without peril. Moreover, by this stage, one possesses natural spiritual awareness, ensuring the heart remains undisturbed and the elixir furnace unoverturned. These matters must be understood, and thus I have expounded upon them at length.

From last year to this day, I have lectured forty-nine times in all—a perfect seven sets of seven—fittingly accordant with the principles of creation. Here, I conclude these teachings. May scholars each exert themselves diligently in their cultivation.
