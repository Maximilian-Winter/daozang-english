**Preface to the *Returning to the Source Sutra***

The Tai family, yearning for the true lineage, traversed sacred realms and studied the correct Dharma, ever holding the salvation of the world as their heart’s intent. They devoted themselves wholly to the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of life. For it is said that learning immortality is most simple, yet people make it difficult for themselves; shedding the dust is not hard, yet people find it arduous—how deeply lamentable!

As the ancients declared:
*"Clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,
Karmic winds stir the sea of stillness."*

Once, at a posting station, I encountered my late master, the Perfected One of Purple Yang. In words of utmost simplicity—no more than half a phrase—the efficacy of his verification was revealed in but a moment. Thus did I know that immortality could indeed be learned, and joy arose within me.

When the golden elixir congealed and the sacred embryo reached completion, Tai composed the *Returning to the Source* in eighty-one five-character quatrains, bestowing them upon later learners to awaken early to the true essence. Let none wait until old age, when lead is empty and mercury scarce! Urgently, one must awaken, seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend together the immortal ranks, transform and ascend in flight—this is my sincerest hope.

—Preface by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove

**Five-Character Quatrains**
**Chapter One**

**Chapter One**
Lead and mercury form the true body,
Yin and yang unite in the Great Primal.
Simply know the practice of two eights—
Then may you refine the golden elixir.

**Chapter Two**
Mercury is the marrow of the Azure Dragon,
Lead is the fat of the White Tiger.
Gather them into the crucible,
Harvesting requires knowing the time.

**Chapter Three**
The Maiden rides the lead tiger,
The Metal Elder mounts the mercury dragon.
With *jia* and *geng* clarifying the true command,
Refine until the furnace glows crimson.

**Chapter Four**
The serpent’s soul seizes the dragon’s marrow,
The tortoise’s spirit restrains the tiger’s essence.
Within the Flower Pool’s divine water,
A single bud of jade fat blooms.

**Chapter Five**
White snow flies in the jasper garden,
Yellow sprouts emerge in the jade grove.
If only one can shape it like the crescent moon,
Where then to refine the red lead?

**Chapter Six**
The medicinal ingredients open the primordial chaos,
The fire-tending tempers the vast expanse.
After ten months, the embryo of immortality transforms—
Only then does one know the merit of the nine revolutions.

**Chapter Seven**
Where the dragon conceals its pearl,
When the fowl broods its egg—
Who knows that lead and mercury unite
Just in time to drink the *daogui*?

**Chapter Eight**
Bathing relies on the water of Kun,
Sighing depends on the wind of Xun.
The infant has no cares,
Dwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity.

**Chapter Nine**
In the Purple Court seek the Maiden of Li,
In the Vermilion Mound pair the Lad of Kan.
Where the Yellow Matron mediates their union,
The Supreme Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.

**Chapter Ten**
The Qian steed enters the golden chamber,
The Kun ox enters the wooden palace.
Who shall escort the Maiden,
To wed her to the Metal Elder?

**Chapter Eleven**
The Maiden is just sixteen,
The Metal Sinew precisely twenty-seven.
Within the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises,
Their joyous union bears the firstborn son.

**Chapter Twelve**
Last night by the western riverbank,
The toad’s light shone on the azure sea.
Gathered and brought to the jade chamber,
Within the crucible, it refines itself.

**Chapter Thirteen**
Li and Kan do not copulate,
Qian and Kun transform of themselves.
If one can comprehend this principle,
A single point descends into the Yellow Court.

**Chapter Fourteen**
The Elixir Valley generates divine water,
The Yellow Court holds the Great Granary.
No longer thoughts of hunger or thirst—
Straightaway one reaches the immortal realm.

**Chapter Fifteen**
The horse of intent returns to the spirit chamber,
The ape of the heart guards the grotto chamber.
Spirit, essence, soul, and will—
All transform into purple-golden frost.

**Chapter Sixteen**
One aperture holds three passes,
The three passes are the crossroads.
Suddenly, with light movement,
Divine water circulates of itself.

**Chapter Seventeen**
To restrain the *po* is not by the heart’s restraint,
To constrain the *hun* is not by the will’s binding.
Only retain spirit and qi—
In an instant, the mysterious pearl congeals.

**Chapter Eighteen**
The oral instructions are few,
Refining the elixir takes but a moment.
Gently tend the fire,
After ten months, the infant is born.

**Chapter Nineteen**
Husband and wife first unite in joy,
As years deepen, their intent turns profound.
Within the bridal chamber, auspicious qi arises,
No day without the spring breeze.

**Chapter Twenty**
Sudden rain on paper butterflies,
Golden furnace and jade peonies.
At the third watch, the red sun blazes,
In the sixth month, pristine frost chills.

**Chapter Twenty-One**
From the sea’s depths, the complete fire flies,
From the mountain’s brow, the earthly spring stirs.
In a moment, their union is complete—
The true crucible emits pure smoke.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
Break open the aperture of the Mysterious Origin,
Pierce through the barrier of primordial chaos.
Simply know how to boil water and fire—
Let dragon and tiger coil as they will.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Fire within the water of *Saketa*,
Waves upon Kunlun’s peak.
Who can master its application?
The great meaning lies with the Yellow Matron.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
The medicine is drawn from the primordial qi,
The fire seeks the essence of the Great One.
If one knows how to gather the medicine and tend the fire,
The elixir’s completion is surely seen.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
How to ingest the original qi?
True essence need not be moved.
True essence and original qi—
These are the foundation of the great elixir.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**
The Confucians clarify nature and principle,
The Buddhists strike at empty obstinacy.
Unacquainted with the immortal’s art,
The golden elixir’s work is done in an instant.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
Mercury in the crescent-moon furnace,
Lead within the cinnabar crucible.
Tortoise and serpent are one true qi—
Their offspring is born of the prior heaven.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Seek the crescent, full, and waning phases,
Withdraw and add in accord with waxing and waning.
Unknowing of the true creative transformation,
What then is the true lead?

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
Qi is the life within form,
The heart is the spirit within nature.
If one knows the cavity of spirit and qi,
One is indeed an immortal attained.

**Chapter Thirty**
Wood marrow simmers in the golden crucible,
Spring flows into the jade furnace.
Who will devote three hundred days,
Slowly applying their effort?

**Chapter Thirty-One**
The jade crucible refines lead’s liquid,
The golden furnace nurtures mercury’s essence.
Nine returns make nine revolutions,
Gentle nurturing follows the cycle of stars.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
Jade liquid nourishes the spirit chamber,
The golden embryo binds the qi’s pivot.
Simply seek the medicine within—
No need to consult elixir texts.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
The fire jujube is the original kernel,
The intermingled pear bears no dregs.
All day long, tend the fire—
Divine water irrigates the golden flower.

**Chapter Thirty-Four**
Refining qi is but wasted effort,
Preserving spirit is vain labor.
How could one know the elixir’s marvel?
All day long, it fills the true void.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**
To refine the primordial qi,
First dry the living mercury.
Once the sacred embryo is formed,
The crown breaks open with thunder’s roar.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**
Qi’s arising is not tied to the kidneys,
Spirit’s dwelling is not in the heart.
Qi and spirit are hard to grasp—
They transform into a single mass of gold.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
One aperture is called the Mysterious Female,
Within it are stored qi and spirit.
Who knows this aperture?
Seek no further for the true.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**
The spleen and stomach are not the spirit chamber,
The bladder is but the kidneys’ surplus.
I urge you: do not cling to these—
They are not the ladder to the elixir.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
A thousand verses on inner visions,
A goblet of wine from the Central Yellow.
Carefree, unburdened by things,
Beyond the body lies the cosmos.

**Chapter Forty**
Crow and hare boil together,
Tortoise and serpent coil of themselves.
Transformed into a single grain of elixir,
Gently nurtured into the embryo immortal.

**Chapter Forty-One**
All things born must die,
The original spirit dies and revives.
When spirit returns to the qi’s cavity,
The Dao of the elixir naturally completes.

**Chapter Forty-Two**
Where spirit and qi return to their root,
When body and mind revert to their mandate—
Such is the true aperture,
Few indeed know it.

**Chapter Forty-Three**
Within the body lies the Mysterious Female,
Within the heart, no dust or defilement.
Who can comprehend and recognize it?
Within this single aperture, the true is contained.

**Chapter Forty-Four**
True dragon and tiger of *Li* and *Kan*,
*Qian* and *Kun* align as horse and ox.
Each person possesses them in full—
Yet none know to cultivate them.

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Hun and po govern the heart,
Spirit and essence enveloped by intent.
Steadfastly tend the fire’s timing,
Silently move the primal line.

**Chapter Forty-Six**
Below the heart, above the kidneys,
West of liver, center-left of lung—
Neither intestines nor viscera,
A single *qi* flows freely through.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
The wondrous work needs no intent,
The true mechanism requires no time.
Who can know this aperture?
Yet do not indulge in non-action.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
Something exists where nothing seems,
Non-action merges with action.
The power of transformation lies in hand—
Crow and hare congeal golden fat.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
Tiger roars upon the four mountains,
Dragon hums east of the Northern Sea.
To seize them, one must wage wild battle,
Entrusting them to the *Gen* and *Kun* palaces.

**Chapter Fifty**
*Fu* and *Gou* govern brightness and obscurity,
*Zhun* and *Meng* hold true dawn and dusk.
The elixir crucible congeals white snow—
Nowhere to seek the monkey’s heart.

**Chapter Fifty-One**
Black mercury, ox-yellow leaves,
Red lead blooms with purple flowers.
Yet still the fire’s timing must be followed—
Within the tripod, cinnabar forms.

**Chapter Fifty-Two**
Wood’s essence beware the hare,
Metal’s essence shun the cock.
Withdraw and replenish during bathing—
Just as the moon reaches fullness.

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
When the ten thousand winds first stir,
A thousand peaks beneath the full moon—
Hasten to issue the true command,
And circulate the *qi* through the *Zhoutian*.

**Chapter Fifty-Four**
The medicine’s ingredients discern old and young,
The fire’s timing employs withdrawal and replenishment.
A single grain of elixir radiates light—
The cold toad illuminates the jade eaves.

**Chapter Fifty-Five**
The clam’s belly once split for its pearl,
The hen’s nest where eggs are easily found.
From nothing, something arises—
Spirit and *qi* naturally contend.

**Chapter Fifty-Six**
Spirit and *qi* are not mother and child,
Body and mind are no husband and wife.
Only by aligning with Heaven’s mechanism—
Who knows where the elixir forms?

**Chapter Fifty-Seven**
Where the elixir’s head first congeals,
When the medicine has already coagulated—
Dragon and tiger wage mutual battle,
Even the Eastern Lord knows nothing.

**Chapter Fifty-Eight**
Side doors and minor methods,
Strange arts and idle words—
The secret of golden liquid and returning elixir
Has no second path.

**Chapter Fifty-Nine**
Noble and base, high and low,
Husband and wife, brothers—
If destined to cultivate immortality,
All may study the elixir canon.

**Chapter Sixty**
A broken house is easily repaired,
A withered medicine is not hard to revive.
Only know the method of return and restoration—
Gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains.

**Chapter Sixty-One**
Hun and po form the three natures,
Spirit and essence unite the five phases.
Within them, the four images divide—
Gathered and concentrated into the embryo’s essence.

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
Steadfastly seek lead and mercury,
With a heart of ashes, seek earth and gold.
Only then know the true aperture—
Who grasps its profound depth?

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
Creation has no root or stem,
Yin and yang possess their origin.
These true wondrous points—
Not even father and son transmit them.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**
Retain mercury within the golden tripod,
Guide lead into the jade pool.
Host and guest know no left or right—
Only recognize the infant.

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,
Elder Ding’s heart is compassionate.
The art of nurturing requires no other technique—
From nothing, the child is reared.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
The crimson palace soars with a green phoenix,
The cinnabar field nurtures the jade toad.
Within the gourd, the sky knows no night—
White snow falls in delicate flakes.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
After zither and lute harmonize,
When the family legacy is complete—
No need to tend the fire’s timing,
Yet beware of harming the infant.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight**
The eldest son enters *Dui*,
The youngest daughter returns to *Qian*.
The *Xun* palace and earth’s position—
The locks of the *Zhoutian* seal themselves.

**Chapter Sixty-Nine**
Between the waxing and waning of the moon,
At fullness and emptiness—
Withdraw and replenish according to punishment and virtue,
Bathe in accord with waxing and waning.

**Chapter Seventy**
Old mercury, three catties of white,
True lead, a single point of red.
Seize the marrow of Heaven and Earth—
Their union occurs in a fleeting moment.

**Chapter Seventy-One**
Where the fire’s timing penetrates the mystery,
Who through the ages would dare transmit it?
Before knowing how to gather and refine—
Do not inquire about the *Zhoutian*.

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
Clouds scatter from the crabapple moon,
Spring deepens with willow winds.
Who can fathom this meaning?
Raising one’s gaze, one asks the empty void.

**Chapter Seventy-Three**
In the human realm, no things burden,
In the heavens, immortal steps await.
Having learned to ride the clouds away,
Together they come with white cranes.

**Chapter Seventy-Four**
The heart’s field bears no weeds or filth,
The nature’s ground is free of dust.
In the quiet of night beneath the bright moon—
A single cry of a spring bird.

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
White metal refined through the six trigrams,
Black tin passes the three barriers.
At midnight, in the third watch—
The golden crow enters the Guanghan Palace.

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
When the elixir ripens, no dragon or tiger remain,
When the fire ends, mercury and lead rest.
Having shed the embryo and attained spirit-transformation,
One becomes an immortal of the Jade Clarity.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
Block the path to the Yellow Springs,
Pierce open the east of the Purple Palace.
How did Master Haichan—
Transform into a crane, emerging from *Niquan*?

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
Where do rivers and seas return?
To whom do mountains and cliffs belong?
Once the golden elixir matures—
All become treasures within the house.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**
Lü received the oral secret from Zhong,
Ge transmitted the heart-seal’s teaching.
No idle words at all—
All concerns only mercury and lead.

**Chapter Eighty**
Mercury and lead return to a single tripod,
Sun and moon must share the same furnace.
Advance the fire with caution—
To help you congeal the jade nectar.

**Chapter Eighty-One**
Gathering and union,
Advancing the fire and bathing—
By the time of shedding the embryo,
The nine nines of yang numbers are complete.

**Postface to the "Returning to the Source" Chapter**
Those who refine the golden elixir must know:
The winter solstice does not lie in the *zi* hour,
Bathing is not confined to *mao* and *you*.
Mercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, fluids, nor blood.

The seven returns are returning to the root,
The nine restorations are returning to the source.
Metal’s essence and wood’s liquid—
When they meet earth, they unite.
Dragon and tiger, horse and ox—
All are without form.
As the former master’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:
“The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flowery pond”—
These are lead and mercury.

One who knows the origin of lead knows where mercury is produced;
Knowing lead and mercury, one knows the divine water and flowery pond.
Knowing the divine water and flowery pond, one may refine the golden elixir.
The work of the golden elixir is accomplished in an instant—
Not bound by the nine years and three years of rigid schedules,
Nor need one cling to months, days, or hours in practice.

As Zhongli said: “The four great elements of the body all belong to yin.”
Thus, one cannot seek within the body itself,
But must seek that single speck of yang essence within.
Yet this yang essence resides in one aperture,
Beyond the reach of ordinary minds to fathom.
This very aperture is the gate of the mysterious female,
The very divine water and flowery pond.
Knowing this, one may gather and unite,
Then proceed to refinement and bathing,
Advance to embryo separation,
And further nurture the elixir to completion.

How can one not discern the source of rivers,
Know the weight of ingredients,
Or recognize the proper times?
Since receiving the teachings of my master,
I have known this body need not perish,
And this elixir must be achievable.
Now that the great work is underway,
I record this for future seekers of immortality.
