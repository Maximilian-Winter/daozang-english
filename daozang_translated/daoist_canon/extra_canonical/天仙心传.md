**Preface to *The Heart Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals***

When the cycles of fate are inconstant, the rise and fall of the world’s fortunes, the clarity or obscurity of the Dao’s course—these mechanisms lie with humanity, for heaven and earth turn in response to them.

In high antiquity, each person preserved their spirit in full; the cycles knew no obstruction, and the Dao knew no obscurity. In the present age, however, the world exalts form and sound, striving to sweep away emptiness and stillness. This corruption began with the guiding masters, who at first misconstrued subtle teachings, forgetting that purity of emotion (pronounced *zhěng*) leads to downfall, thus erring themselves and leading others astray. Later, those who wielded words for self-gain arose to echo them, luring scholars in droves into their snares, so that even in death they did not repent. They failed to awaken to the wondrous interplay of being and non-being, the true succession of phenomena—matters by which the sages discerned the subtlest mysteries. For in its functioning, the Dao makes no distinction between the sentient and the insentient; it is one, not two.

Modern guiding masters do not perceive this, nor do scholars awaken to it. Thus, a pernicious custom has taken root, bringing the decline of the lower epoch to its completion. The fortunes of body, world, and Dao have reached a state scarcely worth inquiry. Though the Creator can do nothing about this, humanity, as the most numinous of creation, may yet reverse this course—by first modeling ourselves after the sages of antiquity.

What does it mean to model ourselves after antiquity? In our land, there was Fuxi; in the western regions, the Able One (the Buddha); in the eastern realm, the Great One (Taiyi). They enlightened the ignorant and nurtured integrity, refining the human heart. They bequeathed subtle teachings to instruct later generations. The scriptures of the Three Teachings remain intact; to read them with a purified heart is to realize that world and self are not two, that nature and life are one. Only then does one grasp that humanity governs the world, while spirit governs humanity—heaven, earth, and humanity as a single thread, their principle thus.

Did not Taiyi say: *The human body is the body of a lifetime; the heart is heaven, the body is earth, and thoughts are humanity. Cultivating sincerity, rectitude, self-discipline, and harmony, extending to governance and peace—no need for elaborate schemes, only the return of pure thoughts to sincerity.* The sagely governance of high antiquity did not rely on external systems or outward restraints; it achieved merit solely through self-cultivation. If each person cultivated themselves as the foundation of learning, how simple, how profound, how free it would be! That they could lead others to learn from themselves arose from their reverence for emptiness and stillness in thought—what is meant by *"The root of the world lies in the state, the root of the state lies in the family, the root of the family lies in the self."*

To exhaust this principle further: the root of the self lies in the heart, the root of the heart lies in spirit. Spirit is not numinous without emptiness, not tranquil without stillness; without numinosity and tranquility, how can spirit attain purity? Thus, learning reveres emptiness and stillness, and the Dao’s course is governed by spirit.

After the Three Dynasties, people competed in meritorious deeds, believing tangible proofs to be trustworthy. This opened the door to artifice and deceit, obscuring the Dao’s course and causing the world’s fortunes to decline daily. The Venerable Lü (Lü Dongbin) took pity on this and initiated the tradition of "healing the world." Our ancestor, Master Li of the Mud-Pill (Li Niwan), silently assisted him. Alas, the world grew ever more decadent, its multitudes steeped in defilement, so that among billions, scarcely one was found.

My teacher, Master Taixu, upheld the lineage without fail, guarding emptiness and stillness while aligning his conduct with the *Doctrine of the Mean*. He did not pursue meritorious deeds but befriended others through the heart. In the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign (1786), I first heard of these teachings in the Great Scouring Grotto of the Mysterious Canopy Cave-Heaven, where the divine man Qu Pengtou silently verified and transmitted them to me in the realm beyond knowledge and awareness. They have long been engraved upon my heart.

Now, humbly acknowledging that my learning falls short of my teacher’s, I am unable to propagate the soundless melody of the heart to scholars. Thus, I have compiled these three volumes in two works, collectively titled *The Heart Transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*. If later learners inherit this and truly refine their oneness to achieve spiritual transformation, they will stand like a pole and cast a shadow without fail.

Its essential principle can be encapsulated in four words: *emptiness, stillness, constancy, sincerity*. The foundation of these four lies in perfecting the spirit, which is the ultimate aim of learning. Sincerity, after all, means nothing more than making spirit the master of body and world.

Written on the first day of the latter half of the first lunar month in the *jiawu* year of the Daoguang reign (1834), by Min Yide of Mount Golden Canopy, with reverence.

*Self-Narration*

My master transmitted the methods of the Heavenly Immortals’ practice to me in the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign (1786), when I first heard them in the Grotto-Heaven of Mysterious Canopy. I have treasured them in my heart for forty-seven years since. Though I have often expounded them to others, few have truly absorbed them. Across the ends of the earth, I have worn through iron shoes in search; through ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, I have vainly labored in spirit to prolong vision. Fearing that my master’s transmission might be lost to the weeds, I now dare to preserve these oral instructions in print.

Yet for beginning learners, some may find their nature and temperament still impure, their inner gates unopened; others may be long entangled in the dust of emotions, their obstructions deeply ingrained. The method requires first a thorough cleansing, followed by *cun* and *si* (cun being focused contemplation, si being refined reflection). Should obstacles arise, though they may stem from postnatal obstructions, they ultimately arise from wayward thoughts running rampant, causing true qi to remain hidden and the inner gates to stay sealed.

For the superior practitioner, the only way is to refrain from forced circulation, to simply uphold stillness of thought, to advance naturally without wavering from beginning to end, and thus return to the prenatal state, where the body becomes crystalline. Therefore, to return to the prenatal, the method lies solely in perfecting emptiness and stillness—thoughts devoid of thought—so that postnatal qi naturally subsides, the prenatal reappears, primordial qi flows once more, and the body’s inner gates suddenly open wide, revealing a radiance of five-colored spiritual light in countless clusters. This is the concrete evidence of the five phases converging. The learner must neither be alarmed nor overjoyed, relying entirely on unwavering singularity to attain profound samadhi.

Refined into pure essence, it is then nurtured with true oneness. When the practice is complete and the work fulfilled, the sacred qi pervades heaven and earth, the primordial embryo models the ten directions—this is its manifestation, revealing benevolence. Yet who knows it transcends the Three Clarities, ascending and descending, for the Great Ultimate is fundamentally non-existent? This is its concealment, hidden in function—who knows it rides the six qi, circulating through absolute emptiness without governance?

Abiding in the true realm of the Great Void, one becomes an eternal Golden Immortal—this is the ascension to be realized. What celestial steps remain to ascend? One no longer distinguishes between oneself and the Primordial Jade Clarity of the Great Beginning. Alas, the world remains fixated on chasing externals. Even when granted this simple and direct method, many retreat in confusion and abandon themselves. Their failing lies in the phrase *"release the ten thousand entanglements"*—without grasping this, they never begin. Even those who do not ignore this phrase may only briefly sweep away distractions, believing their inner state to be already empty and still. Clinging to the method of *"aligning with the celestial pivot,"* they rush into the Yellow Center, carrying with them the mundane spirits and qi of the postnatal, blocking the mysterious apertures within the body. How is this different from hauling water and mud to fill the sacred realm of Kongtong? Even if one later exerts the strength of five laborers to clear it, traces of mud and water remain, difficult to wash away. Even if cleansed completely, time marches on without pause, and only those who hold fast to the Dao until the end can be called seeds of our lineage. If one abandons the path halfway, it is like fearing choking and giving up eating—how pitiful!

Thus, I record my master’s heart transmission for the world. Now, as I transcribe these texts, I once again sound the morning bell of *"release the ten thousand entanglements"* for learners.

Written on the intercalary Double Ninth Day of the twelfth year of the Daoguang reign (1832) by Min Yide of Mount Golden Canopy.

**Inner Chapter (Nine Stanzas)**
The Master said: *"Transform through merging—*
*the Heavenly Immortal’s practice begins with releasing the ten thousand entanglements,*
*so the body naturally becomes empty and still.*
*Thereupon, draw in the pure and steadfast,*
*abide in constant illumination,*
*centered and unwavering, without the slightest lapse.*
*Perfectly empty, perfectly still,*
*perfectly clear, perfectly harmonious—*
*what is inside, what is outside?*
*What exists, what does not?*
*Transformation upon transformation, life upon life,*
*all entrusted to suchness.*
*Return to wondrous function—*
*thus, thus it is.*

*Form the inner body within the body,*
*this is called the true self.*
*Revere it as the sovereign,*
*regard it as the child.*
*Nurture it with warmth and bathing,*
*feed it with your care.*
*When the work is pure and the practice refined,*
*return to the Great Beginning.*

*From end to beginning,*
*few are the admonitions:*
*cherish the merged and tranquil,*
*strictly avoid the vague and blurred.*
*Vague and blurred, merged and tranquil—*
*how far apart are they?*
*One remains in perfect awakening,*
*the other sinks into confusion.*
*Awakening makes a sage,*
*delusion makes a demon.*
*Such is the master’s teaching—*
*take heed, do not misconstrue."*

---

**Outer Chapter (Eight Stanzas)**
*The heart transmission of the Heavenly Immortals*
*sees the body as crystalline.*
*Borrowing it to align with the steadfast,*
*is like standing beneath the sun.*
*When the steadfast shines, life arises;*
*when it infuses, transformation occurs.*
*Transformation upon transformation, life upon life—*
*the work relies on this single method.*

*Heaven is born from the One,*
*Earth is completed by the One.*
*If the body loses this One,*
*how can its crystal clarity endure?*
*The One as One*
*is thoughtless yet sincere.*
*Neither existence nor non-existence stands,*
*both self and dharma dissolve.*
*The spirit of original function*
*interroots with its root.*
*Place the body in the One,*
*place the One in the heart.*

*From the vast celestial realm*
*to the tiniest mote of dust,*
*without color, without dharma,*
*merged and transformed into perfect truth.*
*This is the true self,*
*the body beyond the body.*
*Invisible to sight,*
*inaudible to hearing.*
*With spiritual powers and transformations,*
*it appears and vanishes at will.*
*When the work is complete and the practice fulfilled,*
*one ascends in peace to the Jade Clarity."*

These two chapters are what I heard from my master. Recorded in the *renchen* year of the Daoguang reign (1832) for the disciples of Mount Golden Canopy, they encompass the inner and outer alchemical methods—hence the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters*.

**The Perfect Method (Four Stanzas)**
*The upper aperture reaches the Nine Heavens,*
*the lower extends to the Nine Abysses.*
*Heaven, Earth, and Humanity guard the egg—*
*the Yellow is the field of fortune.*
*I reside within it,*
*merged and transformed with Qian and Kun.*
*Knowing return, knowing reversal,*
*nothing postnatal precedes the prenatal.*

*Refine it purely, purely refine it—*
*where is there ground that is not heaven?*
*Constantly true, truly constant—*
*mysterious, and yet again mysterious.*
*Unbroken, dense, and subtle,*
*the Dao is perfectly round.*
*When the work reaches its utmost,*
*I am the Buddha, I am the Immortal."*

These four stanzas were taught to my disciple Xue Yanggui. The learning of the Heavenly Immortals’ heart is now complete—hence the *Perfect Method*.

**Continuation (Twelve Stanzas)**

Alas, my aspiring scholars,
where there is will, there is fulfillment—
the Three Nis heal the world,
why not follow in their steps?

Embrace the merging transformations,
eschew fragmentation.
Borrow emptiness to embrace stillness,
borrow stillness to return to emptiness.
When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its depth,
the foundation of the supreme Dao is laid.
In three years or five,
body and world dissolve into the subtle.

Proceeding thus to nurture and cultivate,
never self-satisfied or complacent,
enduring and vast—
how dare the spirit grow lax?

The Bhagavān, the Uighur Sangha,
since virtue transformed them,
signs and proofs have ever renewed.
For two thousand years,
war and plague have not encroached.
Men uphold balance and uprightness,
women, seclusion and chastity.

The Western Records recount:
the Buddha, too, was but a man.
The sutra says, *"Hold to the World"*—
Xuanzang’s translation.
Merit neither waxes nor wanes,
merging transformation brings purity.
When the work reaches its utmost,
concealment or manifestation follows the heart.

This is the true supreme Dao,
the heart’s words of sages through the ages.
Scattered through the scriptures’ phrases,
the world, indolent, neglects to study them.
Lüzu gathered and revealed them,
only to see them sink again.
Niwan inherited the fallen thread,
Tai Xu continued the proclamation.

This humble one received it,
yet has not transmitted it.
The solemn, resounding tone—
the Great Purification is now thoroughly explored.
Thus I compile and expound,
wishing to share it with fellow seekers.
Emptiness, quiescence, constancy, sincerity—
these four words must be firmly upheld.

The following is titled *"Continuation,"*
twelve chapters in all,
a sequel to the transmission of the Heavenly Immortals’ heart.
The method of practice is simple and direct,
neither overgrown nor fragmented.
Follow it step by step,
and attain great freedom—
truly corresponding, inside and out,
to the wordless true sutra of the Western Sage.

According to the *Western Records*,
the land of Ulugh (Uighur) stretches for tens of thousands of *li*,
its soil rich and fertile.
Its dependent states, like shields and ramparts,
rely on its yearly aid.
Their customs are the purest,
surpassing even those of Fuxi’s age.

Further consulting the Buddhist canon:
before the Bhagavān’s arrival,
Uighur customs were extravagant,
its people idle and indolent.
Frequent ocean floods,
with no thought for embankments,
gradually led to collapse.

At that time, there was an elder
named Wonderful Moon,
devout in the Buddha’s teachings.
He invoked the Bhagavān,
who, from Central India,
led twenty-five hundred disciples
to arrive in that distant land,
piling stones and building dikes.
The elder followed,
providing his own resources,
hiring workers to reinforce the walls.
Soon, the whole nation transformed,
the stones were laid, the dikes completed.
Thereafter, the sea stilled its waves,
and the Uighur lands were spared excessive rain.

The Bhagavān then expounded
the *Dhāraṇī of Holding the World*,
bestowing it upon the elder,
before returning to Central India.
(This was Śākyamuni Buddha.)
In our dynasty’s Zhenguan era,
Master Xuanzang returned from the West,
translated it by imperial decree,
and the emperor’s preface to the sutra
records these events in full.

Compiled by Min Yide.
*The Resounding Tone of the Great Purification* (eleven sections in all).

The Blue-Haired Master Qu said:
Teaching has no sound or scent,
only awakening in harmony.
Not-form yet form,
not-emptiness yet emptiness.

Master Shen of Great Emptiness said:
This is called the Dao.

Qu responded:
Model heaven, embrace earth,
cultivate the body with earth’s pattern.
Utmost sincerity never ceases—
the Dao is my own heart.

Shen said:
Yes. This is called virtue.

Qu continued:
Affairs require mutual support to succeed,
things yield to one another to abound.

Great Emptiness added:
Gain and loss are fundamentally impermanent—
is not calculation the error?

Shen intoned:
Form is precisely emptiness,
emptiness precisely form.

Qu responded:
Not knowing, not perceiving,
following the decree of the Emperor.

Shen answered:
Shatter emptiness and nothing remains.

Qu said:
Yes. Turn the body, forget the self,
and the celestial truth appears.
Thus may one know:
within being, there is no self.

Shen then continued:
Only then is it the indestructible vajra body.

Shen further intoned:
The Great Dao originally has no self—
observe emptiness and abide in emptiness.

Qu responded:
Neither being nor non-being is established—
the real lies between being and non-being.

Shen said:
No gain, no loss,
together following the course of fate.

Qu answered:
This is the true message—
how many are those who understand its sound?

The Blue-Haired Master intoned:
The Supreme Dao is nearly lost,
while earthen jars resound like thunder.

Great Emptiness responded:
Only the skillful means remain,
moving and still in accord with heaven’s heart.

Shen further intoned:
Clouds part and the sun appears of itself;
the sun appears and clouds vanish.

The Blue-Haired Master answered:
Yet one must contend within the heart—
the message itself is impermanent.

Qu then said:
As with healing the world’s fate,
when fate falters, it is up to man.

Great Emptiness responded:
Grasp this essential teaching,
and the rest is to first enliven the spirit.

The Blue-Haired Master continued:
The spirit is master of body and heart,
body and heart are heaven and earth.

Great Emptiness concluded:
The Creator has no fixed intent,
thus man holds the world’s authority.

*Resounding Tone of the Great Purification* (eleven sections in all).
The Perfected Qu the Blue-Haired and Shen of Great Emptiness
expounded these teachings together in the Great Purification Grotto-Heaven.
I, Min Yide, received them in my heart,
at first thinking them all the echoes of my own mind.

In the first year of the Jiaqing era,
Li the Blue-Haired of Fengtian arrived at Jin’gai,
and our meeting was deeply congenial.
I recalled the *Resounding Tone*,
and Master Li immediately exclaimed:
“The supreme sound is rare,
the spirit-chamber unsettled—
no one hears the call and response.”
A title must arise from the immediate context
to accord with the Dao’s intent,
thus it is named *Resounding Tone of the Great Purification*.
Now, thirty-seven years have passed.
Hearing the echo transmitted through the empty valley,
I record and inscribe it here.
May scholars deeply embody its meaning.

Respectfully noted by Min Yide.

**Admonitions to Myself** (Nineteen Chapters)

The kite soars to heaven, the fish leaps in the abyss—
such is the natural mechanism of qi,
arising from the field of blessings.
No need for effort in bowing or lifting,
for it unfolds of itself.
Utmost sincerity knows no pause,
and the Great Dao coalesces therein.

My body is earth, my mind is heaven;
thought is both self and other,
for self and other are one.
Merge and transform them,
subtly and ceaselessly,
never obscured by time,
never ensnared by the moment.

How easily spoken—
yet when thoughts cease, the spirit is clear.
But how can thoughts cease?
Neither pursue nor heed them.
Through feigned emptiness and feigned stillness,
one attains clarity by effort.
When clarity reaches forgetfulness,
only constancy can sustain it.

Let me not falter again—
while the body endures, it must bear the Way.
Once transformed by the world,
how can one regain what was lost?
My years are advanced,
only a single breath remains.
Seize this breath
to uphold the mandate and act.

Beneath all heaven and earth,
few share this aspiration.
Let me not wait in delusion—
if action is needed, act at once.
Before returning to the Great Work,
the spirit still refines the spirit.
How can one hesitate?
The whip of duty brooks no delay.

The Venerable Miaoyue was but an ordinary man of Magadha,
yet he revered the Buddha’s teachings,
and the Buddha responded in kind.
The records in the scriptures—
can they deceive us?
Sufficient proof, sufficient faith—
I may follow his example.

Moreover, this supreme Dao
depends solely on me.
Attain the center, attain correctness,
attain constancy, attain harmony.
As the mind commands the fingers,
as wood returns to the whirlpool,
hold fast without slackening,
be vigilant in solitude, with no other aim.

How soundly I once slept—
only urgency awakened me.
If even I have come to this,
what can the world recognize?
Unworthy as I am,
how dare I shirk responsibility?

The world mocks:
“Is this transmission truly real?
If so, why are disciples not many?
Why have you alone heard it?
The world’s decline has lasted long—
why did you not receive it sooner?”

Silent, I had no answer.
Suddenly, the spirit spoke in a great voice:
“What can be said is hard to say.
Wait until the Dao is perfected—
then you will grasp it in error.”
The Mud-Pill Palace of Pure Yang
was guarded by the sages of old.
Only after birth, in a certain year and month,
did they reveal their awakening.
This is the celestial mechanism—
how dare I fully disclose it?

When the time came, in the gengchen year,
by the gracious decree of the Divine Mother,
I was charged to uphold and transmit it to the world.
Punishment for disclosure was waived,
and Tai Xu received it,
daring at last to instruct the age.

What does this decree point to?
That learning must be *pure* (zhěng) and *pure* (shéng),
free from partiality or obstinacy.
Yet it also requires the aid of others—
only then can action be thus.
One must first perfect oneself as a person.

Maintain harmony and stillness of thought,
unassailed by others.
Uphold and preserve it,
and body and world will be at peace.
If learning is not perfected,
it only disturbs the mind.

Thus, I have proceeded slowly—
this is caution, not negligence.
Now, I only urge myself,
not daring to urge others.
Let each examine themselves,
and remain steadfast in resolve.

May fellow seekers awaken,
each reflecting inwardly.
In emptiness, stillness, constancy, and sincerity,
if one is deluded, arise at once—
this too is healing the world,
so that body and world flow unimpeded.

Men should embody central correctness,
women should embody hidden integrity.
Through this, nurture and cultivate
this karmic body to its end.
Bathing in the Buddha’s response,
what can Magadha do?

Whether there is a response or not,
accept it all.
Act according to one’s fundamental duty—
to fail is to be less than human.
May my fellow seekers
proceed only in suchness.

The world assents:
“You must persevere.”
Yet endowments vary in depth,
and signs differ accordingly.
Whether one’s path is hidden or revealed,
all is entrusted to suchness.

These nineteen chapters are titled *Admonitions to Myself*,
serving as the conclusion to the entire transmission.

Composed on the full moon of the second lunar month in the jiawu year of the Daoguang era,
at the Jade Altar,
in the Hall of Praise and Transformation,
the Hall of Preserving the Origin,
where the Perfected Lü, Qiu, Bai, Huang, and Shen are revered—
a place of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct.
Its origins trace to Renyan, Chunfan, Lanpo, Jingxuan, and Nan’ya Xinxiang;
its completion to Qingbo, Lanyun, Zhixiang, Jingtang, Jiatang, Buyu, Chunquan, Maotang, Xitang, and Shixiang Yunbo.
These fellow students sought to reverently uphold the teachings of the Jin’gai Sect Altar.

I, however, regard such endeavors as belonging to the realm of action—
existing while people exist,
vanishing when they vanish.
Thus, I have expounded the sagely work of Patriarch Lü in healing the world,
truly pouring forth the heart-transmission,
with the aim of guiding and refining human hearts.

This serves as the decisive remedy for the world’s ills,
a precious raft for cultivating the self.
Collectively titled *The Celestial Immortals’ Heart-Transmission*,
it comprises three volumes in two parts,
to clarify the unity of body and world,
and the oneness of practice and principle.

Due to the adversity of my circumstances,
Jingxuan and Maotang had it printed.
I then compiled these nineteen chapters of *Admonitions to Myself* as a conclusion—
is this not a timely and auspicious convergence?

I append these few lines in gratitude.

Respectfully compiled and inscribed by Min Yide, the Hermit of Jin’gai Mountain, styled Dingfan.

*The Celestial Immortals’ Heart-Transmission*
Transmitted by Tai Xu to his disciple Min Yide, styled Xiaogen
*Inner Chapters*
The Master said: “Merge and transform.”

The Master is none other than Patriarch Li of the Mud-Palace. Carefully examining the *Hunhua* (Merging and Transforming), we find it to be the very *Three Nuns’ Remedy for the World* transmitted by Patriarch Lü. Its method constructs the body as emptiness and nothingness, welcomes the celestial stem to descend and illuminate the pure practice of the Three Powers’ egg-guard, with no other thoughts intruding—this alone suffices.

Tai Xu stated: “This is the supreme, unsurpassed elixir formula of the highest vehicle, to be grasped in the heart but not transmitted in words.” My master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, instructed me, saying: “This is the true heart-transmission of the Most High. Yet to begin, one must first still the thoughts. Whether premeditating the circulation or subsequently engaging in visualization, it is especially crucial to clarify the fundamental principle. What is this principle? Simply to know the return, to know the reversion. For ‘return’ means returning to the origin, and ‘reversion’ means reverting to the root. If one remains ignorant—if the Dao’s essence is utterly empty and its substance utterly nonexistent—then the return loses its return, and the reversion loses its reversion. To seek return and reversion in this state is no different than turning south while heading north. Once the fundamental principle is clear, one may proceed with the work of ‘acting without acting’ and ‘non-acting as acting,’ though this is no easy task. Yet when every step aligns with the Dao, the key lies in recognizing the provisional method.

What is this provisional method? Either one borrows emptiness to contain the real, or borrows the real to refine emptiness. These two approaches are both methods of transforming the illusory into the real. Essentially, they guide one toward the ultimate, but clinging to any single aspect is still attachment. Those who cling fail to comprehend the Dao and virtue. The world’s alchemical texts, all rooted in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, are none other than precious rafts for attaining the center. Yet each school clings to its own doctrine, unaware of the divergence between branches and roots, thereby leading to errors—deviations as slight as a hair’s breadth yet as vast as a thousand miles.

Our lineage traces back to the Qin and Han dynasties, transmitted directly through a single line. It began with Guan Yin, was inherited by Patriarch Lü, and the fundamental principle was revived. Later, it fell into obscurity until my master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, received it. I, Bing (a name in the Tai Xu lineage), have humbly inherited it. Ashamed of my meager virtue, I have merely recorded what was transmitted. For those who study this, I urge you to cross-reference it with Daoist scriptures and verify it against Buddhist sutras. Do not fixate on existence or nonexistence; simply follow the essence of the Dao. In practice, combine preservation and guidance, and strive to reach the state of naturalness—only then will you not betray what has been shown.

**The Work of Celestial Immortals**
Immortals are of five ranks: Celestial Immortals, Water Immortals, Earth Immortals, Spirit Immortals, and Ghost Immortals. Though there are five ranks, those who achieve success are collectively called *Zhenren* (True Persons), for only True Persons can accomplish this. However, people’s endowments and habits differ, making their cultivation practices impossible to standardize—hence the five ranks of immortals. Later disciples have recorded their methods from beginning to end, passing them down through transmission. The alchemical texts preserved in the world are largely of this nature. Without heart-transmission, one remains lost, with no entry point.

Master Bai of the Jade Tube, pitying this, composed the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* to instruct the world. Yet the world lacks those of superior wisdom, and many, questioning their own worth, set aside this treatise without reflection. My master, Patriarch Mud-Palace, recognizing this, taught that one may directly inherit Patriarch Lü’s *Celestial Nun’s Remedy for the World* as the entry point. This way, both self and world benefit, and no further effort is needed—once the work is perfected, it unifies the lineage. Its method ultimately returns to *Hunhua* (Merging and Transforming). Thus, it is titled *The Work of Celestial Immortals*, for it is not something Water Immortals or Earth Immortals can undertake.

**Letting Go of All Conditions**
What are conditions? They are the dust of emotions and the roots of desires. Whether arising from inner accumulation or outer stimulation, they must be let go for the celestial heart to appear. This is the first step in entry. Cultivating nature begins here; cultivating life also begins here. The subtleties within are for the practitioner to realize—no need for verbose explanation. Yet for those entering from below, the methods vary. I will speak only of the most refined, which avoids all pitfalls.

Patriarch Mud-Palace said: When conditions arise, eliminate them at once—this is one method. When conditions arise like brambles, burning within like moxibustion, gather and then release them—this is another method. When conditions arise, regard them with detachment, letting them follow their own course—this is yet another method. Among these three, the last is the immortal’s method. It is like a cloud touching emptiness—emptiness remains unstained, neither harmed nor benefited. For later disciples, the key is to guard their own density.

Tai Xu said: “Indeed.” The Master did not say “sweep away” but “let go.” For conditions are formed by intention, and intention arises from the heart. When the heart dissolves, intention naturally transforms, and conditions lose their root—no effort is required. Let the learner embody this.

**The Body Naturally Becomes Still and Empty**
The *body* refers to the body within. *Naturally* means spontaneity. When qi is still, it is called *stillness*; when thoughts vanish, it is called *emptiness*. In this state, the body equals emptiness and nothingness, and its radiance will surely shine. This line is the first secret key to entering *Hunhua*, and the work begins with visualization.

What is visualization? Initially, one uses the external to verify the internal; next, one uses the internal to verify the external; finally, internal and external become indistinguishable, with no division. Patriarch Mud-Palace said: “This kind of verification is not obtained through the eyes—only then is it true. Yet this is not something beginners can achieve. Thus, the method of using the external to verify the internal is a way of entering intention through the eyes. Next, using the internal to verify the external is a way of entering the eyes through intention. Finally, the state of indistinguishability is the verification of neither intention nor eyes. Only when the learner reaches this point can they proceed to welcome the celestial stem, practicing without false practice. With prolonged, uninterrupted practice, the true heart is constantly present yet appears empty, and true qi is constantly full yet appears nonexistent. This mysterious state arises without preservation and is attained without thought—it is in accord with naturalness. How easily can one reach this stage in practice? The key lies solely in ‘thought within no-thought.’”

**Drawing the Celestial Stem to Progressively Illuminate Constant Practice**
This builds upon the previous line’s verification. By further employing the provisional method of drawing the celestial stem, one constructs true emptiness and true nothingness, entering the mysterious realm. Its progressive illumination naturally has direction (here, *Jin* refers to the trigram *Jin*, meaning advancement).

Nīwán Shì said: “To advance without illumination is to begin from the crown of the head, descending forward to the glabellum, then from the glabellum to illumine and direct the gaze upon the root of the nose. One must first employ true intention to penetrate directly from the crown gate, drawing in the Celestial Stabilizing Star of the upper heavens, thereby naturally guiding the Celestial Stem to descend and align with the body’s stem, gathering and storing it at the root of the nose, converging its illumination upon the *quēpén*. With further practice in emptiness, utmost stillness, and profound sincerity, one naturally penetrates deeply into the mysterious aperture. Once the aperture is felt to be open, cultivate naturalness and firmly uphold the single secret of ‘no-thought,’ and the true verification of fetal breathing will naturally be attained. Yet without constant practice, it cannot be achieved. Know that this single method of practice sustains one from beginning to end. Only when one has transformed the mortal to become a sage, leaving not a single hairbreadth of the untransformed state, may one cease. Between heaven and the abyss, there is no moment’s interruption—*heaven* refers to the cranial bone of the celestial cover, while *the abyss* refers to the soles of the feet, the *yǒngquán* point.

The Celestial Stabilizing Star resides at the center of the heavens, surpassing the sun, moon, and stars in height, formed by the ascent of the great earth’s essence. It is truly the master of the Dipper’s mouth and the Celestial Stem. It is also the central star among the Five Stars, radiating brilliance across the five directions while never deviating from its constant course. Below it lies the Northern Asterism (that is, the Celestial Pivot), governing the myriad phenomena. In the human body, it corresponds to the cranial bone of the fontanelle, which is formed by the body’s generative *qi* after birth and connects upward to the Celestial Stabilizing Star. Thus, to draw the Celestial Stem, one must first greet the Stabilizing Star. Once the Stabilizing Star is connected, the Celestial Stem naturally flows downward. From this point, the advancing illumination persists day and night, like a vessel upturned to receive the descending sunlight, inwardly and outwardly luminous, penetrating above and below—only then is the postnatal fully transformed.

This step is precisely the essential secret of returning to the origin. The secret is called *Returning to the Yellow*, wherein the breath halts, and *qi* penetrates through the front of the spine, ascending directly via the central path of the lower and middle regions to reach the cervical vertebrae, appearing neither to rise nor fall. This is because the primordial *qi* is pure and without substance to be grasped. The ancient sages followed this, stating that only when practiced in a state of singular, unadulterated thought does all ascent and descent belong to the primordial, free from harmful effects, and the verification becomes supremely spiritual. If, however, emptiness and stillness have not yet attained naturalness, one may allow ascent to proceed as it will but must not forget the secret of directing descent toward the sea.

Thus was the oral transmission of the Great Void. For beginners to rashly undertake *Returning to the Yellow* risks the flaw of the postnatal following the ascent. Should one remain ignorant of this, the harm will be no small matter.

**Perfect Emptiness, Perfect Stillness, Perfect Purity, Perfect Harmony**
The method of practice is lofty and universal; it must be perfectly rounded without flaw. To achieve this, not a trace of the mortal or postnatal may be mixed within—only then is it wondrous. The Master of the Great Void said: “Emptiness and stillness are the essence; purity and harmony are the verification. When the practice attains perfect roundness, there will be no harmful effects. This is far removed from the initial learner’s reliance on physical circulation or contemplative visualization to achieve penetration and pervasiveness. Once penetration and pervasiveness are achieved, one naturally returns to the pure practice of ‘no-thought’ and naturalness. All methods at this stage are called *mixed transformation*, and thus the operation must be based on pure stillness and naturalness. Otherwise, one will inevitably encounter the flaws of *clashing into the Yellow* or *rushing into the Yellow*.

**What is internal? What is external? What exists? What is nonexistent?**
Generation after generation, transformation upon transformation—all is entrusted to *thusness*. As it is said, *thusness* is the deeper attainment of naturalness. The Master of the Great Void said: “The internal refers to what lies within the physical body—viscera and the like. The external refers to the physical body itself—skin, flesh, sinews, bones, and so on.” Yet Nīwán Shì speaks of the internal as the physical body and the external as the Dharma-body. This is the method of the Three Ní’s of Lǚ Dòngbīn for healing the world: shaping the immortal’s flesh as if using heaven and earth for a stove and cauldron, clay pots for vessels, and the illusory physical body for meat, sustained by concentration and wisdom. The method is exceedingly simple and easy—merely close the six gates and prevent the leakage of *qi*. This is the practice of fetal breathing.

What I now teach, however, accounts for the fact that the learner’s body and mind are not yet settled, and the apertures are not yet open. One must begin with physical circulation and proceed to contemplative visualization. Only when the apertures are fully open and contemplation is free from delusion may one follow the profound instructions of the master without interruption, thereby avoiding the flaw of self-deception. Learners, take heed—do not skip stages.

**The Wondrous Function of Returning, Thus and Thus**
*Return* means returning to the origin; *revert* means returning to the root. The Master of the Great Void said: “Know that the root is utterly empty, and the essence is utterly nonexistent.” Those who are ignorant of this principle often lose the *return* in their attempt to return and lose the *reversion* in their attempt to revert. As for the *wondrous function*, it involves operations such as using the false to contain the real and tempering the real to forge the empty. Learners, examine this carefully—do not become attached to emptiness or reality. Thus it is said, *thus and thus*.

**The Inner Body Within the Body—This is Called the True Self**
This corresponds to the *True Person* in the alchemical texts, yet the method here is far simpler and easier. Beware of inconsistency—neither acting nor withdrawing, nor drifting into laxity or dullness. The method employs the Great Void as the furnace and cauldron, with the physical and Dharma bodies as the medicinal substances. Concentration and wisdom serve as water and fire, while uninterrupted practice serves as the firing times. When the firing is sufficient, the True Self manifests. There is no need to break through the crown and ascend afar; its concealment and revelation follow the heart, unbound by location or distance, perceived only in movement and stillness.

**Honor It as the Sovereign, Cherish It as a Child**
The methods shown in the alchemical texts are all provisional. Failing to grasp their meaning leads to no small error.

**Nurturing, Bathing, Nursing—These Are Mere Outlines**
The Master of the Great Void said: “Though *nurturing*, *bathing*, and *nursing* have established teachings recorded in the alchemical texts, there are living methods—like Yu’s dredging of the Nine Rivers, following the terrain and guiding the flow. One relies on the mysterious state of one’s own practice to contemplate it, naturally aligning with the heart without deviation, aiming only for centrality and harmony.”

**When merit is pure and conduct flawless, return to my primordial beginning.**
Merit is inner merit; conduct is inner conduct. The phrase *"return to me"* means to restore what was originally mine. *"Primordial beginning"* refers to the inception of the precelestial, the root of the Limitless, the true One.

Tracing back from end to origin, the Master’s instructions are few: cherish the state of undifferentiated oneness, and strictly avoid vagueness. Though *"vagueness"* and *"undifferentiated oneness"* may seem close, one leads to perfect awakening, the other to utter confusion. Awakening makes one a sage; delusion makes one a demon. Such is the Master’s teaching—take care not to misconstrue it.
*(These twelve lines are also the instructions of Master Tai Xu.)*

**Outer Chapter: The Heart-Transmission of Heavenly Immortals—Seeing the Body as Crystal-Clear**
*"Seeing"* is inner vision, the mind’s perception. *"Body"* is the physical form, the ordinary vessel. *"Crystal"* is like clear quartz, a metaphor for luminous transparency.

This stage of practice begins when all entanglements are relinquished. One must abide in the subtle state of *"as if present, as if forgotten"* to avoid being led astray by illusions. Thus, it is called *"crystal-clear"*—the meaning of *"the great awakening, thus and unmoving."*

**Borrowing the Dipper’s Light, as a Crystal Vessel Receives the Sun**
*(The method is detailed in the* Medical Salvation Formula*. It is like holding a crystal vessel beneath the sun, where light naturally pours in, illuminating within and without.)*

When the Dipper shines, life arises; when its light infuses, transformation occurs. From transformation comes generation, and from generation, endless renewal—yet the practice remains one single method.
*"Shining"* is universal illumination; *"infusing"* is concentrated infusion. *"Life"* arises spontaneously; *"transformation"* is ceaseless change. Though the methods differ, they all depend on the true One. Thus, it is said: *"the practice is but one method."*
*"Method"* is the principle; *"practice"* is its application, governed by the true self within.

**Heaven is born from the One; Earth is completed by the One.**
The wondrous work of Heavenly Immortals is nothing more than generation and completion. Even Heaven and Earth serve as proof—all is generation and completion. Yet their profound meaning relies on the One.
If one seeks immortality, how can the One be abandoned?

**Lose the One, and what rank can one attain?**
The body is born from the One. When the body is seen as crystal-clear, purity is achieved. How can purity be maintained? By knowing how to return, by being *"without thought yet sincere."*

Thus, Master Tai Xu taught:
*"The One as the One—without thought yet sincere, where neither existence nor nonexistence is established, and both the person and the method dissolve."*

*"Without thought"* means thought within which no thought arises. *"Sincere"* is the sincerity of *"without sincerity, there is nothing"*—the true One. *"Existence"* refers to what is heard and seen; *"nonexistence"* to what is unmoving and unchanging. *"Not established"* means allowing concealment and revelation to unfold naturally. *"Person"* refers to human emotions; *"method"* to principles. *"Dissolving both"* means relinquishing all scrutiny and seeking.

When practice reaches this point, thoughts naturally still, and the mind regains its profound tranquility. This is what must be sincerely upheld from beginning to end.

By sincerely upholding it, emptiness can be fully realized, stillness can deepen, fetal breathing can be perfected, the Mysterious Pass can open, breath can pause, and true *qi* can circulate without obstruction or stagnation. Then, whatever is concealed or revealed is nothing but the true state. Yet, to avoid pitfalls, one must maintain *"still vision without attachment."*

**Tracing the original spirit, its root interpenetrates its root.**
Place the body in the One; place the One in the heart. The great cosmos of the macrocosm spirals into a speck of dust—colorless, formless, merging and transforming into perfect reality.

*"Original"* means tracing from end to beginning. *"Interpenetrates"* means mutual exchange, like circulation. *"Root"* is the source from which all arises. *"Its"* refers to the true One. *"Place"* means to settle. *"Body"* is the physical form; *"One"* is the true One; *"heart"* is the mind of discernment. *"Cosmos"* refers to the body; *"speck of dust"* to the nature. *"Color"* refers to the physical body; *"form"* to the Dharma body.

*(Careful note: "Merging and transforming" means uniting the physical and Dharma bodies, placing them in the heart of Heaven to undergo refinement. Though the physical body is inherently impure, it contains the true One; though the Dharma body is inherently pure, it is tainted by the mundane. Thus, they must be layered, refined, and purified until the true essence emerges and becomes whole.)*

The marvel of the method lies in the phrase *"its root interpenetrates its root."* The following *"placing the body"* and *"placing the One"* already encompass the great cosmos and the subtlety of spiritual application. Yet the reason such spirit is attained is because *"the mind arises where there is no abiding."* Thus, it is said: *"colorless, formless, merging and transforming into perfect reality."* The exquisite subtlety within cannot be fully expressed in words.

**This is the true self, the body beyond the body—**
Invisible when seen, inaudible when heard. With divine transformations and concealment or revelation at will, when merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, one ascends peacefully to the Jade Clarity.

*"True self"* is the true person. *"Body beyond the body"* is a comparison to the physical form, for it can depart from the body yet remain undivided in its comings and goings. The next two lines quote scripture to affirm that the true self is the essence of the Dao, serving as a sharp rebuke to deluded mortals—lest they remain confined by conventional teachings and fall into illusion without awakening.

The final four lines reveal that *"true emptiness is not empty"* and *"true nonexistence is not nonexistent."* Fools do not recognize that Heaven, Earth, and the Three Powers are but one. They admire the immortals’ concealment and revelation but do not understand the cause behind it. It all depends on the One Mind: when it reveals, it reveals; when it conceals, it conceals. For the mind of the perfected one has become undivided and unceasing with Heaven and Earth—thus, their concealment and revelation are boundless, their divine transformations unfathomable.

At first, the physical body has not yet attained pure Dharma, so there is the practice of merging and transforming. Once pure Dharma is attained but naturalness is not yet achieved, one cannot yet ascend peacefully to the Jade Clarity. Thus, there is *"merging with merging, merging without merging, merging and transforming, merging and perfecting"*—remaining in the world to refine it.

Only when merit is complete and conduct fulfilled does one ascend to the Jade Clarity. *"Peaceful ascent"* means no longer needing to *"labor and break through the crown to ascend afar."* For the Six Directions and Three Continents are all within the One Mind—without location or distance, where is there high or low, near or far? Why labor over rising and descending?

All this arises from merging into the One and the divine work of *"the great cosmos spiraling into a speck of dust,"* achieving union with Heaven and Earth in virtue.

Far removed from earthbound immortals, water spirits, ghosts, and all other types of transcendents—who remain distant from heaven and must still ascend to reach the Jade Clarity—this is what is called the work of celestial immortals.

**The Perfect Formula:**
Above, it exhausts the Nine Heavens; below, it reaches the Nine Abysses.
The Nine Heavens refer to the head and brain—specifically, the Mud Pill Palace.
The Nine Abysses refer to the Bubbling Spring, the center of the sole of the foot.
This is because the human body is a small heaven and earth, and thus the ancients spoke in such terms.
*Exhaust* means to fully attain; *reach* means to penetrate to the utmost.
It contains the method of ascending and descending in mutual pursuit, acting without pause in both heaven and abyss.

**The Three Powers Guarding the Egg—Yellow as the Field of Blessing:**
The *egg* is the chicken’s egg, a metaphor drawn from Buddhist scriptures.
*Yellow* refers to the yolk of the egg, symbolizing the human world.
*Guarding* means using the Great Void as the crucible and the Three Powers as the medicinal ingredients.
This is the general formula of merging and transformation.

**I Abide Within It, Merging and Transforming Qian and Kun:**
*I* is the true self.
*Abide* means to dwell and guard.
*Within* is the Yellow Center.
*It* refers to what the true self naturally accomplishes, hence the use of *its*.

According to the method: one merges the body and world into the Yellow Center, simply following the substance of the Dao. A single thought of emptiness and quiescence—quiescence and emptiness—neither abiding in any place nor mingling with discursive knowledge. Naturally, the celestial *qi* descends, and one listens as the *qi* ascends, transforming blockage into harmony.
This is the initial verification of merging and transformation, hence it is called *merging and transforming Qian and Kun*.

**Knowing Return, Knowing Reversion—Nothing Posterior Is Not Prior:**
*Return* is returning to the origin.
*Reversion* is reverting to the root.
*Posterior* refers to the postnatal.
*Prior* refers to the prenatal.
*Knowing* is awareness, akin to clarity.
Only with clarity can one attain sincerity; with sincerity, there is nothing that does not return, nothing that does not revert.
Through such reversion and return, there is naturally nothing posterior that is not prior.
This is the divine verification of spontaneity, pertaining to the refinement of essence, *qi*, and spirit—still within the inner workings.

**Able to Unify, Able to Integrate—Nowhere Is Not Heaven:**
*Able* means capability.
*Unify* means singular focus, referring to application.
*Integrate* means whole and undivided, referring to verification.
The Dao of Earth is even; the Dao of Heaven is odd.
Odd is yang; even is yin.
At this stage of merging and transformation, pure yang is achieved, with no trace of yin remaining—hence it is said *nowhere is not heaven*.
This is the verification of the outer workings, not easily attained.

**Eternally Real, Truly Constant—Mysterious and Yet More Mysterious:**
*Eternal* means enduring; *real* means uncontrived.
What is cultivated and accomplished is both enduring and substantial, substantial and enduring.
When the work reaches its ultimate, verification naturally becomes real.
Thus it is said *mysterious and yet more mysterious*—having reached the ultimate of the limitless.

Tracing its beginning and end, it does not exceed the two words *return* and *reversion*.
Pursuing its utmost, one returns and reverts to the substance of the Dao.

**Unbroken and Dense—The Dao Is Nowhere Not Complete:**
*Unbroken* refers to eternal reality; *dense* refers to true constancy.
*Dense and unbroken* means attaining utmost sincerity without cessation—how could the Dao not be complete?
Thus the master concludes: *The Dao is nowhere not complete.*

**Work Transcending Its Ultimate—I Am Thus Buddha and Immortal:**
*Work* is the work of return and reversion.
*Transcending* means surpassing.
*Its* refers to the Dao.
*Ultimate* is the ultimate of the limitless.
*I* is the true self.
This *I* is the *body beyond the body* spoken of in the outer workings—formless yet possessing form, akin to the Buddha’s body of purple-gold or the seed of true constancy in the Mystery School.
Thus it is said: *I am thus Buddha and Immortal.*

**Racing Alongside Fuxi, Shoulder to Shoulder with the Primordial Beginning:**
*Fuxi* is the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi.

"Shoulder to shoulder" means racing alongside as equals.
*Primordial Beginning* is the title of the origin of all existence and non-existence.
*Comparing shoulders* signifies standing side by side.
This concludes the metaphor in the preceding text.
Let the scholar take heed not to cling to appearances—if so, who was Shun but a man, and who are you but a man?

**Ritual Regulations of the Esoteric Medical Dao for Saving the World**

**Setting Up the Altar:**
A single meditation chamber, with a clean table placed in the center, and a low table set before it—one positioned before the sacred image, the other in the eastern part of the room.
The chamber need not be large, but must be clean and bright.
Doors and windows tightly sealed to block the wind.
Two rush cushions—one placed before the sacred image, the other in the eastern part of the room.
A palm-fiber mat, a tablecloth, and a set of three ritual implements.
At the center, offer a plate of white rice; above it, a cup of pure water, an oil lamp, a pair of candles, and three sticks of fine incense.
A clean robe and a pair of clean shoes.
Nothing else is to be placed within.
**Entering the Altar.**

**Entering the Altar with Reverence**

Proceed with utmost reverence, as if dull-witted, and only then enter. Upon entering, hold the body upright, empty the mind of all distraction, and unify the thought into singular focus. Only after withdrawing from sight and sound may one perform the three prostrations toward the sacred image. Once completed, step aside, face west, and sit upright before the low table, upon which the esoteric ritual texts are placed, with a rush cushion beneath.

The practitioner sits solemnly, awaiting the settling of qi. Only then are the ritual texts unfurled. Silently recite the mantra *Oṃ* (唵) and *Hūṃ* (蓝) two, three, five, or seven times—this serves to purify body, mind, and intent. While reciting *Oṃ*, one must hold no thought within, visualizing the generation of pure, empty qi, vast as water or the sky, before uttering *Hūṃ*. In the Western method, a prolonged intonation follows *Oṃ*. If adhering to this principle, simply draw out the *Oṃ* sound. Should the practitioner perform this with sincerity, visualization, and devotion, three repetitions suffice.

Upon completion, proceed with the ritual invocations, though their specific forms are not recorded here, for the method relies on spiritual reverence. If wishing to withdraw, one must first approach the sacred image, perform the three prostrations as before, and then depart.

In spiritual reverence, the spirit turns toward the void while the physical body remains still and unmoving. Upon withdrawal, the body exits, but the spirit remains inwardly concentrated. Not only must one refrain from speaking, seeing, or hearing, but inwardly, one must preserve the vision of clarity and harmony. When responding to matters, do so and then immediately release them—do not cling to emotions, lest the state of concentration be lost. Should distraction arise, restore focus at once; with focus, release follows naturally. Thus, the spirit remains perpetually clear, and qi perpetually serene.

Should one re-enter, the ritual procedures remain as before. Once the practice is complete, withdraw and seclude oneself, ever holding as the highest principle the cessation of thought and the forgetting of emotion. At first, this may require effort, but in time, it becomes effortless. Do not fear difficulty, nor seek mere ease.

**Conclusion of the Ritual**
One must possess unwavering sincerity and make a great vow. There is a gāthā to be recited, then silently forgotten in prostration:
*"By the grace of my teacher’s transmission, I borrow emptiness to embrace stillness, borrow stillness to return to emptiness. Emptiness reaches its limit, stillness its depth—thus the Three Origins align with the mechanism, mutually healing the world. May the signs of efficacy appear swiftly, at this very moment, without delay. With earnest heart, I pray: may I attain the wondrous state beyond form and non-form."*

After reciting, perform three prostrations, approach the sacred image, and perform the three reverences as before before departing.

These ritual regulations comprise four essential principles.

The teachings bequeathed by the successive sages are of utmost simplicity, yet as they pertain to the rules of entry, they include both advancing and retreating ritual forms. For the aspirant who practices them, all is centered within the self. *On Cultivating Immortality and Dispelling Delusion* states: "Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; take the mind as the chamber of the spirit." Here, however, the mind is taken as Heaven, the body as Earth, and intention as Humanity. Through this, one attains emptiness, attains stillness, attains the center, attains harmony, attains perfection, and attains the ultimate—whereby the self and the world naturally transform. At this moment, the two bodies of form and formlessness must either merge or not merge, yet without any obscurity—this is called fusion, called transformation.

Thus did Patriarch Lü establish the teachings of the Heart School. Should one cling to ritual or to circumstances, one strays far from the school’s doctrine.

**The Orthodox Canon of the Mysterious School with Annotations**

**Opening Gāthā of the School**
Embrace the real within the empty,
Return to the empty from the real.
When real and empty fuse as one,
The self and the world may be healed.
The method of practice follows below.

**The True Word of Fusion**
*Oṃ*—drawn out.
Not counting repetitions, one enters the pure emptiness of unified *qi*, where the sounds and odors of the world and the self are also extinguished—this is called fusion. The efficacy lies in the syllable *oṃ*, hence its prolonged resonance. For it encompasses the essence of the character *kuò* within the resonance of *oṃ*. Yet according to the inner scriptures, this is called the Realm of Purity, not fusion.

**Sacred Proclamation**
Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, Divine Treasure;
Jade Purity, Supreme Purity, Grand Purity.
One *qi* flows and pervades,
The Three Purities unfold and transform.
Radiant yet silent, wordless yet governing the four seasons;
In perfect emptiness and colorless void,
Unacting yet generating the Three Realms.
In the Great Canopy Heaven, within the Golden Palace,
From emptiness and spontaneity arise
The Three Purities, the Three Realms, the Three Treasures—the Heavenly Venerables.

This is the Proclamation of the Divine Mother of Jade Purity, issued by the Great One, originating from the primordial beginning. Commonly known as the *General Proclamation of the Three Purities*, its tradition is ancient. Master Niwan states: "Those who cultivate this proclamation must avoid杂知杂见, taking boundless emptiness and the extinction of sound and odor as the essence." The rest of the proclamation directly describes the body of the Dao. If not the Divine Mother, none are worthy; if not the Great One, none could compose it. Those who cultivate the supreme Dao should hold it inwardly. Though the world misconstrues it, the full meaning of the Three Purities is contained herein—calling it the *General Proclamation* is not inappropriate.

**Petition**
Prostrating, we note that the cycle has turned to the Lower Prime, where only unity can renew. We, inheriting profound grace, gather the world to return to the heart. Revering benevolence, revering compliance, the multitudes renew their *qi*. We humbly beseech vast compassion to universally bestow illumination.

Heaven’s *qi* descends as benevolence; Earth’s *qi* ascends as compliance. Within each inhalation and exhalation, the two principles circulate mutually. Initially, one must consciously direct it; in purity, it arises spontaneously. The wonder lies in neither attachment nor fixed abode.

**True Word of Repentance and Liberation**
According to the inner scriptures, this is the *Great Bright Mantra*, the heart-sound of the Bodhisattva of Freedom. When sincerely recited, the world responds and things transform; the body and corpse align in compliance, awakening the supreme thought of bodhi—thus dissolving karmic records. Yet in its method of practice, it is most rigorously precise.

Master Niwan states: Patriarch Lü adopted this. The calamities of the Lower Prime are all wrought by humanity. The mechanism of creation operates thus: if karmic records are not dissolved, the world’s fortune cannot flourish.

*Oṃ yānī bānāmíng hūṃ* (sounded as "hǒu").

The method begins with self-observation of emptiness. One must observe until body and mind are forgotten, and the world and self become one. When one perceives a grain of millet within, moving through it, and its color is black as lacquer—this is the world and self of the Lower Prime, blackened by habitual defilement. At this moment, recall the true word, and one must cultivate it to the point of holding as if not holding, whereupon the resonance enters and the heart communicates. Beware of arising thoughts or deliberation, for then one attains the soundless sound, resounding through the ten directions, unaware whence the sound arises. This is the verification of utmost sincerity, attained in the midst of not-holding holding—akin to reciting in a dream. Only when one has cultivated to this point does the world respond and things transform, the body aligns and *qi* congeals.

Such is the sacred method of Patriarch Lü’s healing school. How could mere recitation with the throat and tongue attain this? Yet the Dao does not depart from the world; to ascend to sagehood, one must begin with the throat and tongue. Practitioners must not fail to awaken to this.

**Cloud Script**
This Cloud Script, as declared by the Great One, is called *Mysterious Reconditeness*. It speaks of the congealing of the primordial true *qi*, the heart-flower of the Divine Mother, wherein each script character contains mountains, rivers, Heaven, and Earth. The scriptures of the Three Teachings embody its essence, which may be fathomed, yet its application is inexhaustible.

At that time, Elder Guo comprehended it and composed the *True Word of Mysterious Reconditeness* to transmit to the world. The world later falsely turned it into an *Opening Sutra Gāthā*, unaware that it specifically pertains to the Cloud Script. Its essence may be fathomed—it is the *Original Mandate*, hence it may be employed to heal the world’s fortunes. For all who cultivate and circulate it, merit and practice are both fulfilled, benefiting the world and the self. This script embodies the body of the Dao; its body being utterly true, its application is naturally divine. Yet it cannot be fathomed by private wisdom—hence its application is said to be inexhaustible. The *Gāthā of Mysterious Reconditeness* is no empty phrase.

There are eighty-four such scripts.

The Divine Mother disseminated them, the August One transcribed them, the Veritable Mother corrected them, Zhengyang compiled them, Guo Lao elucidated them, Pure Yang employed them, Mud Pill inherited them, and Yibing transmitted them.

My master, the Mud Pill Master, said: The Great Simplicity’s Cloud Scripts scatter throughout the Great Void. These were the auspicious causes of an era, when the August One, in celestial purity, beheld and transcribed them, storing them in the celestial treasuries and bestowing them upon the perfected of the world. It is like a *hūla* of pearls scattered across the world—without punctuation or meter to trace, without rhyme or rhythm to verify. Zhengyang, having gathered them, sighed: "Scattered longevity has no measure; longevity is hard to perfect." Moreover, the forms of the scripts were strange and elusive, their transcription far from easy. Thus, the Veritable Mother descended in response, bestowing rhymes and meters to make them readable. Zhengyang received them and translated them into standard script, compiling them into a text, whence arose the name *Great Cavern Jade Sutra*. Yet it was not yet included in the canon—until the Liu-Song dynasty, when Lu Jingxiu of Wucheng, by imperial decree, incorporated it.

I have examined their worldly use: they indeed have their applications. In the general translation into standard script, each character is meticulously arranged within the hooks of the seal script, wherein profound meanings reside. The medical arts of Patriarch Lü uniquely employ the *Wanbao* ("Myriad Treasures"), which is said to derive from the *Primordial Jade Method*—that is, the seal-compiled scriptural phrases *Namo juefa juyi* ("Homage to the Jeweled Dharma Phrases"). My master further said: All things arise from their own source. The Cloud Scripts arise from the Metal Writ. The Metal Writ’s manifestation appears in Wang Ni. What is Wang Ni? It is the *Original Mandate*. To study is to borrow and investigate; this is to exhaust the source. Knowing and circulating it with reverence, transformation upon transformation, life upon life—this does not violate the body of the Dao.

One must know that the root of the Dao is the Great Void, its body fundamentally the utmost non-being. Once this principle is illuminated, even the terms "void" and "non-being" are but what Wang Ni itself issues forth. This is called thorough comprehension; scholars must embody it with awe and not neglect it.

The following twelve scripts were added by Patriarch Lü, yet their profound meanings may be inferred and discerned:
⑤ They refer to the Dao of Confucian lineage’s transmission.
⑥ They refer to the Dao of Daoist lineage’s transmission.
⑦ They refer to the Dao of Buddhist lineage’s transmission.

The twenty-four scripts to the right were added by the Mud Pill Master, who regarded them as invocatory words. The Mud Pill Master proclaimed: "This lineage is the utmost Dao; the Cloud Scripts are the true writ. When a single script is circulated by the heart, the spirits of the Three Powers look down in reverence. Whatever is sought will unfailingly manifest; whatever is wished will naturally come to fruition. One who can circulate the complete script, circulation upon circulation, issues forth from the heart of heaven. Not falling into the realm of being or non-being, how could its efficacy not be attested? The Lamp-Lighter once recorded: hidden or manifest, it follows the heart’s intent."

The Mud Pill Master further said: "There is a legacy of circulation, but without affinity, it is difficult to encounter. What is this legacy? The Patriarch of the Dao, Pure Yang, said: For scholars who practice circulation, simply store the Cloud Scripts in sequence, whether in the navel or the brain, observing their proper order. Circulate accordingly: first Wang Ni, then the Metal Writ, then the scripts—do not reverse the sequence. What is Wang Ni? It is ○. What is the Metal Writ? It is ⑨."

The Mud Pill Master also said: "When Patriarch Lü circulated Wang Ni and the Metal Writ, he employed the Celestial Eye. For oral practice, he relied solely on the two syllables *Oṃ*, using the method like polishing a mirror—this is the correct way to employ spirit in circulation. Thus, when circulating the scripts, he shifted to the Celestial Eye, circulating them toward the void. Once the script was formed, he gathered and stored it in the navel or brain, wherein lies the most subtle and profound meaning. Though the scripts are circulated beginning with the Metal Writ, this Wang Ni is the *Original Mandate* of the Three Powers, the very source of all transformations and life. In terms of the body: before emerging from the womb, its original position is in the brain; after emerging, it descends to the Sea of Qi.

Furthermore, the Metal Writ is the original nature of the Three Powers, the hidden and manifest source upon which all things rely. In terms of the body: before things respond to stimuli, its original position is in *Li* (the Heart); once stimulated and responding, it arrives at the Celestial Valley. Thus, when scripts are circulated following the Metal Writ, they descend from the front of the Celestial Valley—descending to achieve clarity is most excellent. When circulated following Wang Ni, they ascend from behind the Sea of Qi—ascending to achieve harmony is most excellent. Circulating accordingly, ⑩ store in the brain, ⑾ store in the navel. Moreover, one must silently circulate each script through the entire sequence, thereby avoiding imbalance. Circulating thus, ascent and descent are balanced, yin and yang are harmonized, and breath is even. Through natural cultivation, the mechanisms of the Three Origins’ qi return to the primordial; the primordial returns to its origin, and body and world are endlessly governed.

If one practices without ceasing, for three to five years, nurturing and refining, how could the world not be transformed, circulation not flourish, heaven not be heaven, or earth not be earth? Know that the frequent advent of calamities is all wrought by humanity. Thus, immortals, buddhas, sages, and enlightened teachers instruct us to cultivate and examine body and mind, returning to the body of the Dao—then longevity and heaven are not divided.

The art of healing the world was initiated and compiled by Patriarch Lü, who employed the Cloud Scripts to cultivate and verify. The method is simple and easy, fundamentally relying on sustaining a single thought. This is what is meant by sincerity of intention and rectitude of mind, rectitude of mind and cultivation of the body, cultivation of the body and ordering of the household, ordering of the household and governance of the state, governance of the state and then peace under heaven. How could this be for the benefit of the self alone? To say the Dao is not external to the self—this principle is both profoundly subtle and utterly practical.

Did not the Great One say: "The human body is a lifetime’s body; the heart is heaven, the body is earth, and thought is humanity." Humanity dwells amid heaven and earth, minute as a grain of millet, yet heaven truly envelops earth, and earth bears all things while supporting heaven. In form, it is like a chicken’s egg: heaven is clear, earth is yellow, and beings teem within. Who governs and fashions it? Only humanity can. Thus, the two creations invert as if humanity bears them—humanity is the spirit of heaven and earth."

Thus, the spirit values emptiness and stillness. There is a gatha that says:
*"One step overturns the dusty world,
With emotions forgotten and thoughts extinguished, the heart of heaven is seen."*
This is called "attaining emptiness," this is called "preserving stillness." Through diligent progress, one reaches profound subtlety. Only by mastering profound subtlety naturally can one heal the world without being deluded by it—how easily said, yet how difficult to achieve!

Without sincerity, there is no progress; without constancy, there is no realization. Clearly, this learning depends entirely on the four words: emptiness, stillness, constancy, and sincerity.

**Universal Response Mantra**
*Oṃ* (drawn out) *svāhā* (two-part pronunciation)
As recorded in the inner scriptures, its application follows the mind. Thus, in Buddhist and Daoist contests of power, it is universally employed. Carefully examining this method, the two syllables following *oṃ* are directly pronounced as *svāhā*. Above *svāhā*, it is always annotated as a two-part sound. According to Western methods, this is a combined vowel. In recitation, the *oṃ* tone lingers in the throat and nose, long and subtle. When pronounced aloud, it first aligns with the technique: the following syllable is short and restrained, while the next is resonant and expansive. The final two words—*sa* (swift) and *hā* (sharp)—serve to subdue (pronounced *háng*) all demons, hence its name: the One-Syllable Crown Wheel King Mantra. When this incantation is voiced, within forty *li*, all demonic weapons tremble and fall. In our tradition’s contests of power, the combined sound *hè* is emphasized (level tone) to reinforce it. Thus, there are single, double, and even eight- or nine-part combinations.

Master Lü employed this from the Dipper, naming it the Universal Response Mantra, intending universal resonance and response. The Mud-Pill (Nīwán) also states: After completing the practice, one should always bow in reverence and withdraw. As for repetitions, students must guard against greed. Even reciting eight talismans daily is not too few. The essence lies in preserving spiritual wholeness without leakage, and the true verification of the method is ascending with harmonious *qi* and descending with clarity.

**Vow of Dedication**
Both Daoist and Buddhist rituals—whether scriptures or repentances—include dedicatory verses. These gather the essence of one’s practice and preserve it unwaveringly, embodying the principle of *"this here, this now."*

*"May we uphold profound subtlety,
Draw the world into refinement,
Borrow emptiness to contain stillness,
Borrow stillness to return to emptiness.
At the extremity of emptiness, stillness is steadfast—
The Three Absences merge and transform,
Mutually healing and circulating,
Manifesting wondrous signs (pronounced *jī*).
In this moment, without pause,
With wholehearted devotion,
May we attain the subtle and imperceptible."*

*"Wish"* expresses the grand vow to heal the world. *"Uphold"* means to follow and carry it out. *"Profound"* signifies tranquility; *"subtlety"* means unseen, unheard, and beyond the ken of spirits. *"Borrow"* is to use one to illuminate the other, the method of counteracting afflictions. *"Draw"* means to gather, encompassing both the self and the world. *"Signs"* refer to subtle indications, the source of original nature. *"Emptiness"* points to the heart; *"stillness"* to the body. *"Contain"* is to nurture; *"return"* is to revert to the origin. *"Extremity"* is the utmost point; *"steadfast"* is solidity. The *"Three Origins"* are heaven, earth, and the absence of self. *"Mechanism"* is the true mechanism, the *qi*-mechanism of primordial unity. *"Mutual"* means interpenetration; *"sign"* is verification; *"verification"* is response. *"Wondrous"* (pronounced *jī*) implies unwavering singularity. *"Moment"* is an instant; *"time"* is a fleeting duration; *"pause"* is interruption. *"Subtle"* is what cannot be seen; *"imperceptible"* is what cannot be heard.

After reciting, bow three times, rise, approach the sacred, perform three reverent prostrations, and withdraw. This ritual is the standard, and reciting only eight is the utmost simplicity. Practicing it faithfully yields swift responses like an echo, for one has attained emptiness, stillness, and sincerity. Few achieve completion due to lack of constancy. Learning and application, theory and practice, must proceed together.

**A Teaching from the Divine Immortal Li the Disheveled**
What is *"blending transformation"*? Why must it be followed by *"blending forgetfulness"*?

*"Blending transformation"* is like a crystal vase reflecting sunlight. The entry begins with the artificial. What is the artificial method? Regard this body and world as identical to crystal. Practice sincerely, but guard against seeking effects or clinging to perceptions. The method is to blend and transform this body and world within emptiness and stillness. In your practice, you must first thoroughly understand its meaning to avoid falling into illusion—how can this be done carelessly? Only with clear comprehension can you proceed.

What is its meaning? The tangible is not truly real; the visible void is not true emptiness. Thus, the ancient sages said: *"True emptiness is attained by gold and jade, hence their hardness. True reality is attained by the void, hence its vastness."*

Let me further explain with the two creations: The boundless heavens are formed by the coalescence of earth’s *qi*—yet we cannot deny they are heaven. The solid earth is formed by the coalescence of heaven’s *qi*—yet we cannot deny it is earth. Proceeding with this understanding in blended illumination, thoughts naturally avoid attachment, and the heart attains unwavering singularity. Through such embodiment, reality and emptiness surely merge. When the work reaches this merging, one enters the realm of creation, where distinctions dissolve—hence the name *"blending."* Yet it must be followed by *"blending forgetfulness,"* releasing even this merged state and its functions, to deeply attain the natural state.

Learning to reach the natural avoids all pitfalls—what the ancients called *"advancing another step at the top of the hundred-foot pole."* This teaching was transmitted by the Divine Immortal Li the Disheveled and received by a disciple named Xu. Xu, styled Genyun, was from Taizhou. Though lacking in cleverness, his sincerity was abundant. When the text was presented to him, he wept and bowed day and night. His utmost sincerity moved the divine, and the Perfected Li appeared, imparting the Great Dao. Xu later inquired privately and was told: *"The warp of the Dao is to cease thoughts; the weft is blended illumination and transformation. The realm beyond is blended forgetfulness."* The transmission was a single sheet of paper.

The received paper text remained unread at first. Upon taking and counting it, the words numbered two hundred and ninety-odd. This aligns with the teachings my master, the Great Void Elder, had pursued—the paper’s hue was likewise dim and unadorned. It was not produced for Xu alone but entrusted to him as a vessel. Having studied it closely, I now compile these transmitted insights and set down these few lines to record how the text came to be read.

**A Teaching of the True Master, the Great Void Elder**

The Great Void Elder said: The Three Powers are called the world; my body, too, is called the world. Thus, world and body may be divided or united.

My master, the Mud-Pill Elder, said: In terms of cultivation, man models earth, earth models heaven, heaven models the Dao, and the Dao models spontaneity. In terms of principle, spontaneity is the essence; the Dao is its function. For the essence is fundamentally empty, and the Dao is inherently without form. Proceeding accordingly, the method is nothing but emptiness and nothingness. To cling to action or attachment is to turn from spontaneity, to depart far from the essence—this is called the lesser path, not the pursuit of the aspiring scholar.

Yet have not the ancient sages and worthies declared: "One begins with effort, for people are not sincere; only through non-doing do the many awaken"? What does this mean? It refers to the method, the method of regulation. It means that within action there must be non-action, and within non-doing, effort is applied. Thus the ancients said: "That is not that; not that, yet that. Only when that is not opposed to that is it truly that."

Only those of utmost sincerity and constancy may enter the Dao and realize it.

The Great Void Elder further said: The human body is a small heaven and earth. To speak of heaven and earth is to include humanity within them. The Great One has not said: "My mind is heaven, my body is earth, my thoughts are humanity"? When thus embodied, the Three Powers are one with me—how can body and world be divided?

This is the origin of the sagely work of my Dao ancestor, the Pure Yang Elder Lü, in healing the world. Those who inherit this teaching find their bodies governed and the world at peace, its effects swift as echo and shadow. Yet the verification lies solely within the body, beyond the ken of heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits. It accords with the meaning of "stealing the beams and pillars" in the *Book of Changes*. What is this meaning? Simply the character for "complete and sealed."

In its practice, the method hinges on two words: *cease thoughts*. As the Lü Ancestor said: "The Great Dao teaches people first to cease thoughts; if thoughts do not cease, all is in vain." The "Great Dao" here refers to this single tradition. Those who inherit it may perfect the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds in an instant—provided they do not lack faith, clarity, constancy, or sincerity.

The Great Void Elder also said: A human body is hard to obtain; the Great Dao is hard to hear.

My master, the Mud-Pill Elder, said: "Since you are human, first cultivate the human Dao. You must understand: without cultivating the human Dao, how can you accord with the Dao? The Dao transcends self and other; within it there is no attachment or fixation. Thus it can always respond, always be still, and always be serene—this is the mind knowing to cease thoughts. How can thoughts be ceased? The method is simply not to pursue or heed them. It is like covering the vast sky: if you merely let it be, the sky remains empty, and nothing can harm it."

Have not the ancients said: "Fear not the arising of thoughts; fear only delayed awareness"?

The Great Void Elder said: My master observed that people have several grades, and the Dao has several grades. I shall not fear revealing them to you.

The worldly, those who drift with the waves and follow the crowd, are the multitude. Those who know cultivation and introspection are ordinary beings. Those who cultivate in accord with the world and model the Dao are humans. Those who model the Dao and transform their bodies are Daoists. Those who heal the world through their own bodies are divine immortals. Those who transform the world through their own existence are true immortals. Those who unite world and body in transformation are celestial immortals.

My master asked: "What grade of person do you wish to become?"

I knelt and replied: "Though I am dull, I aspire to become a celestial immortal."

The master then instructed: "Great aspirations are not vain. Those capable may follow, but you must first sweep away all past knowledge and perceptions. All that you have seen and heard before is fragmented—mere lesser paths, where methods are cumbersome and success elusive. The celestial immortal’s heart-learning has no hexagrams, no weights or measures. From beginning to end, it is simply to abide by the two words: *no thought*. Let thoughts arise and dissolve like flowing water; let thoughts return to unity."

Upon hearing this, I bowed and asked: "Then are the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality* also fragmented?"

The master said: "It is your own lack of insight that leads you to such pursuits without comprehension. The ancients spoke thus because they did not recognize the unity of world and body. Now that you have thoroughly grasped this teaching, you should spiritually grasp its essence and apply it to your own body—how can you remain fixed like a stake, seeking answers with a chisel? Have not the ancients said: 'With the secret received, return to study the texts'? And also: 'With the secret received, the texts may be discarded'? How can you now harbor doubts? You have simply misunderstood my words. Those two books are but fishing baskets. What I have transmitted to you is to transform your own body into a fishing basket. You have not yet used your body to fish, hence this question. From now on, simply merge body and mind in blended illumination, then proceed to blended transformation, and finally to blended forgetfulness. Thus you will attain spontaneity, naturally moving from *zhun* in the morning to *meng* at dusk, and aligning with the stars and tides. If you still seek the steed by following the picture, how can the mind be unified, how can thoughts be purified?"

The Mud-Pill Elder said: There are many aspiring scholars in the world, but most cling to the small and neglect the great, thus remaining confined by the world, unable to transcend its bounds. My Dao takes liberation as its core, thus it can merge body and world in transformation. It cannot be named, but is forcibly called *blended transformation*.

The Great Void Elder said: Most aspiring scholars in the world cultivate the body to accord with the world, progressing until they transform the world through their own bodies.

Beyond this point, no further cultivation is added—thus one may possess the aspiration to transcend the world, yet lack the reality of such transcendence. As the saying goes: *"Expending one's life's effort, one somersaults a hundred and eight thousand leagues, yet remains within the Tathāgata's palm."* Our tradition is not so. So long as a single breath remains, this resolve must not slacken for even a moment. In the beginning, one also cultivates the body to accord with the world; then, one transforms the world through the body; from there, one heals the world through the body, progressing until the world is ceaselessly transformed. The aim is to merge world and body into one, moving from stability to transformation—only then is ultimate attainment reached. Thus one leaps beyond heaven and earth, no longer bound within the five phases.

Our tradition establishes its method thus; whether one achieves it or not is not our concern. What is this vow? It is what the inner scriptures call: *"Exhausting this one retributive body to ascend together to the Land of Ultimate Bliss."*

Min Yide respectfully records:

Our tradition's practices are wholly aligned with the primordial celestial origin, though some intermediate stages involve deliberate effort. This is because learners must begin from the mundane world, and thus cannot but employ artificial means to attain the mean. For those who have not yet entered the mundane, one may start with the *Altar Sutra of the Blue Garden*, then proceed to the *Dao De Jing* as annotated by Ancestor Bai, and the *Triplex Unity* and *Awakening to Reality* as annotated by Ancestor Zhu of the Cloud Gate, ultimately returning to Ancestor Zhang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*. These are practiced in accordance with the *Three Numinous Healing of the World*, transforming through the *Mind Transmission of the Heavenly Immortal*, correcting errors with *Wu Yuanzhi’s Pre- and Post-Discourses on Comparative Verification*, and verifying with the *True Meaning of the Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* and *Niniushi’s Twofold Cultivation Precious Raft*.

All the above, though repeatedly revisited, aim only at attaining the two words: *central harmony*. Their essence is nothing more than returning to the root and restoring the origin—what is called *complete reception and complete return*.

Works already printed include:
*The Altar Sutra of the Blue Garden*,
*Master Lü’s Explication of the Three Numinous Healing of the World*,

The above twenty works are bound in one set, collectively titled *The Hidden Library of Ancient Books*. Additionally, *The Heart Lamp of the Golden Canopy* in eight volumes forms another set, bearing the same collective title.

Six further works remain unprinted due to limited resources:
*Li’s Annotations on the Primordial Celestial Worthy’s Pre-Heavenly Dao De Jing* from the Song dynasty,
*Ancestor Bai’s Hand-Annotated Dao De Jing* from the Song dynasty,
