# 吕祖师三尼医世说述

**Preface to *The Venerable Lü’s Exposition on the Three Ni’s Healing of the World***

Writing conveys the Dao, and I have long known of this truth in the world. In my youth, I had the fortune to attend Master Dongli in Mount Tongbai. The Master was a celestial being from Qin, over one hundred and ten years of age, surnamed Gao. The Governor of Zhejiang and Fujian, Lord Gao—of the same clan—passed through the mountain on an inspection tour and presented the *Exposition on the Three Ni’s Healing of the World* to the Master. The Master said: “I once saw this in the inner writings of Master Wang Yangming’s *Kuijian*, compiled and published by his disciple Wang Longxi to transmit to the world. It is the great Dao by which Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor governed the world with their own bodies. I have also heard from the immortal Li Niuwan, who dwells in the world, that my disciple Shen Yibing encountered him three times. Once, Yibing inquired of Niuwan about the two characters ‘Three Ni.’ Niuwan replied: ‘This Dao was transmitted from Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor. The Three Great Sages—Confucius, Śākyamuni, and the Green Ni—expounded it to establish their teachings. The followers of each school recorded their own paths of entry, compiling them into a single work, variously called *Exposition*, *Mind-to-Mind Transmission*, *Methods of Practice*, or *Efficacy of Practice*. Now, however, these texts have scattered and been lost.’” This is what I once heard from Master Gao.

In the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign (1786), on the twenty-sixth day of the tenth month, my great master, the Venerable Taixu, departed this world. Two days prior, he entrusted me with a book, instructing me to keep it and not disclose it. At the time, I was still careless and failed to guard it well. A friend took it to Jinning, and it was long borrowed and never returned—it was none other than *The Venerable Lü’s Methods of Practice for the Three Ni’s Healing of the World*. In the *jiyou* year (1789), when the Zhejiang Education Commissioner, Mr. Zhu Shijun, conducted his inspection in Huzhou, I paid my respects at the Right Literature Hall. Only then did I learn that the Commissioner treasured this book and did not show it to others, though he suspected some passages might be missing. Hearing that a complete version was preserved in the Jingai collection, he deemed me trustworthy and sent me to retrieve it, but I returned empty-handed. He then showed me his own copy, hand-copied by a person of the Ming dynasty, with a postscript by the Earl of Chengyi. I intended to transcribe it, but just then, the Commissioner was preparing to inspect another prefecture, and in haste, the matter was left unfinished.

Four years later, during my official travels, I passed through Mount Jizu and visited the immortal Jizu Daozhe in the Dragon Tree Mountain Lodge. The immortal, surnamed Huang and named Shouzhong, was a Yuezhi from the Western Regions who entered China during the Yuan dynasty. He had long resided on Mount Jizu, hence his name. In the sixteenth year of the Shunzhi reign (1659), he journeyed to the capital and sought the Three Great Precepts of the Most High from Precept Master Wang of Kunyang. Initially, he had no name and called himself *Yedapo*, meaning “seeker of the Dao” in Chinese. The Precept Master, seeing that he had dwelt in China for many years, bestowed upon him the Chinese name Huang Shouzhong. To this day, the people of Yunnan call him the True Man Huang. Though he is over five hundred years old, his appearance is that of a man in his sixties—his eyes bright, his voice resonant as a great bell. Few books lay on his desk: aside from the *Buddha’s Dhāraṇī Sutra for Upholding the World*, there was only *The Venerable Lü’s Exposition on the Three Ni’s Healing of the World*, which matched what Dongli had seen and what Taixu had expounded. I begged to borrow it, but he refused, saying, “No. Return home and seek the two virtues of ‘sincerity’ and ‘inquiry.’ What you gather yourself is not yet the time. Wait a while.” I then asked, “I once received *The Venerable Lü’s Methods of Practice for the Three Ni’s Healing of the World* from my great master, the Venerable Taixu, but before I could study it, a friend took it away. What is this book about?” He replied, “I once had it as well. It is an excellent text. You will obtain it again one day.”

I further asked, “Have you ever practiced this teaching?” The Master said, “The time! The time!” I then asked, “If even a sage like Confucius did not use this Dao to heal the world, why is that?” He replied: “The sage establishes the ultimate standard for humanity and practices this Dao for all ages. The Master’s Dao is vast and not confined to a single era. Moreover, when the Zhou dynasty established its capital at Jiao and E, it was divined to last seven hundred years. By the end of the Spring and Autumn period, that span had reached its end. How could this not be the work of divine assistance, sustaining a declining fate and prolonging its mandate? If the Master had used this Dao to save the world, would it not have brought great order?” I said, “If Confucius had applied this Dao to govern the world, would it not have brought great peace?” The Master replied: “In the Spring and Autumn period, the sea of karmic evil was deep, and the cycle of killing was about to begin. Heaven did not yet wish to pacify the world. The qi of wanton destruction leads to depletion; the qi of excess leads to floods; the qi of grievance and oppression causes severe drought; the qi of rebellion and perversity brings warfare. When these chaotic qi linger and do not disperse, the primordial qi becomes obstructed and fails to flow. A sage without official position can nurture the inherent goodness in human hearts but cannot eradicate the accumulated evil in the world. When the Dao of the teacher is established, good people multiply, and this can sustain the world’s fate. As for those who act with unrest, Heaven will gather and destroy them—this is not something that scholars scattered among the people can manage.”

I then asked, “Does this Dao also have its limits?” The Master said: “A skilled physician treats illness by first removing the disease so that the primordial qi may flow. Have you not heard Laozi’s words? ‘The Dao is great, Earth is great, the King is also great.’ The King is also great because within the seas, all living beings—hundreds of millions—turn to him. He holds the power to revolve heaven and turn the earth. When the Dao and power unite, then weapons, punishments, rites, and music can reform old customs and renew them. Power is sufficient to remove illness and establish peace. But with Dao alone and no power, how can one embrace and pacify the violent and the corrupt?”

The ills of the world are of two kinds: those caused by human action, and those ordained by the turning of Heaven. The ills of human agency arise from the concentration of perverse qi—what is called “the calamity of one’s own making cannot be survived.” Only those who wield power can cure them. The ills of Heaven’s turning may be redressed by harmonious qi—what is called “Heaven’s calamity may yet be remedied.” Only those who embody the Dao can cure them.

Yet Heaven’s turning also shifts in response to human affairs. If perverse qi is dispelled before it takes shape, then Heaven’s turning will respond accordingly. When Heaven’s turning flows freely, primordial qi flows freely; when primordial qi flows freely, the great transformation flows freely. Thus the Dao becomes the Great Dao without limit.

When those above gather and govern, Heaven and Earth complete their work, leaving nothing in the world unfulfilled. When those below establish and guide others, they bring great benefit to all things. To heal the world with the Dao is not to abandon the Dao because of the world’s flaws.

Moreover, in an age of ascending peace, when the seas and lands are at rest, and a great sage rules from above, the Dao and power unite. Within the realm’s borders, there are no obstinate people or corrupt officials to brew misfortune and obstruct the flow of qi. Then this Dao circulates freely, and even a humble scholar may partake in the work of positioning Heaven and Earth and nurturing the myriad things, contributing unseen and unheard.

As for the occasional minor calamities in the generation and completion of the Five Phases and the hundred things—if one practices this Dao to remedy them, aligning above with the benevolent ruler’s intent and relieving below the hardships of living beings—will the response not be as swift as an echo answering sound?

Such were the teachings I received from the Perfected Huang. In the year *guichou*, I traveled to the eastern shore of Lake Dongting and rested at the home of Master Zhu. Zhu was the grandson of my mountain’s elder, the Nine-Returns Master, and was fond of profound learning. He showed me two volumes from his collection: one was a book once treasured by Grand Tutor Wenzheng, also a transcribed copy, though lacking colophons by famous hands. The other was hand-copied by Master Shiyan of Mount Lu in his Dragon Peak Studio, compiled under the title *Hidden Perfection of the Yellow Ancestor*. Its meaning was even clearer, likely the “detailed and excellent edition” praised by the Perfected of Chicken-Foot Mountain.

I begged to borrow and bring them home, though at the time I did not grasp their profound principles and rashly resolved to practice only after mastering the Dao. It was not until the fifth year of Daoguang that I received from my teacher, the Great Void Master, the secret methods for healing the world, and further bathed in the vast and flowing ten thousand words of the written revelation of the Venerable Lü. Only then did the profound principles become clear. I regretted that the transmitted secret methods had been taken by a friend to Jinning and had not yet returned. Fortunately, the Perfected of Chicken-Foot Mountain had said that true attainment must come from within. Thus, I carefully excerpted and recorded the revelations from the sand-writing, and gathered what I had seen and heard, compiling and annotating them. I drew from the teachings of the Confucian and Buddhist traditions, supplementing with scriptural passages. Since I had not yet read the *Sutra of Upholding the World*, I appended seven tentative observations, transcribing them into a single volume. I detailed the origins and transmission of this book to dispel doubts arising from lack of evidence, intending to share it with like-minded seekers.

After completing the draft, someone asked: “Is this Dao only practicable for those who aspire to save the world? Could it also be practiced by those acting out of self-interest?” Startled, I rose to my feet and said: “What kind of question is this! Acting with self-interest betrays the Dao—it cannot be practiced. The Venerable Lü once descended to the altar and solemnly warned: ‘In the functioning of the two qi, yang is virtue, yin is punishment. When moved by self-interest, one enters yin. Impartiality and compassion are virtue; perversity and violence are punishment. If one does not hold the heart of benefiting others and saving people, yet seeks to guide the qi of Heaven and Earth with one’s own qi, the qi of punishment will be summoned, leaving no room for escape. Heavenly demons will respond, heavenly spirits will slay, and the disaster will come swiftly—self-inflicted destruction, unforgiven across kalpas, with no chance for regret.’ Such is the clear teaching of the ancestral master.”

Therefore, for those who study the Dao, rectifying the heart is the foremost principle. Let this serve as a mirror for those who would treat this book lightly.

Written on the full moon of the fourth lunar month in the year *wuzǐ* of the Daoguang era by Min Yide, eleventh-generation successor of the Dragon Gate Orthodox Lineage, with reverence.

**Original Preface**
In the beginning of the Great Commencement, the Dao was established in Oneness.

Firm yet unattached, unshakable yet ungrasping. Without duality or division, without inside or outside, still yet not still, moving yet not moving. The manifestation of hardness and softness, strength and compliance, from which arises the utmost hardness, utmost softness, and utmost compliance. The Great Mother of all life, the origin of the Great Dao—this is called the True One.

The True One is the lively, unconstrained essence of precelestial qi, whose arising cannot be restrained. When it arises, it flows; when it flows, it becomes yang; when it returns, it becomes yin. This flow and return are the beginning of qi. Yang, being pure, ascends; yin, being turbid, descends. This purity and turbidity are the beginning of form.

Thus, the True One is the origin of the generation of Heaven and Earth, embodying the ten thousand things yet emptying the ten thousand things—this is the Limitless. Only through nothingness is there no obstruction, and thus utmost spirit and utmost clarity. Only through nothingness is there no entanglement or hindrance, and thus the capacity to contract and extend. Humans and all beings receive its principle of spirit and clarity as their nature, and its qi of contraction and extension as their life. The ten thousand things all reside within nature and life, and nature and life reside within the True One. Beyond nature and life, there is no Dao; beyond nature and life, there is no teaching. The Three Teachings all emerge from the One.

Confucianism fulfills nature to establish life; Buddhism perceives nature to liberate life; Daoism completes nature to restore life. Confucianism penetrates the One; Buddhism returns to the One; Daoism attains the One. Yet at the utmost of their transformative efficacy, none is distant or unattainable, flowing throughout the four great continents without cessation.

The Dao of Confucianism reaches the point of positioning Heaven and Earth and nourishing the ten thousand things, transforming wherever it passes and spiritually abiding wherever it remains.
*(Xie’s note: When the precelestial One Qi moves within a “certain place,” that place is inevitably transformed and dissolved. When the precelestial One Qi lies dormant in a place without activation, that place inevitably generates spiritual awareness. Is there truly a “certain place”? In reality, there is no such place! The True One is the precelestial One Qi. Thus, it is said, “Wherever it passes, it transforms; wherever it abides, it spiritualizes”—this single phrase exhausts the entire function of the Golden Elixir.)*

The Dao of Buddhism reaches the point of non-abiding generosity, where the merit of the four directions and the emptiness above and below is inconceivable. The Dao of Daoism reaches the point where the ten thousand things act without refusal, give life without possessiveness, work without claiming, and accomplish without dwelling. Their fundamental aim is non-action in service to the world—how could they abandon the self to engage with the world?

Since the beginning of life, self and others share this one nature, this one life, and thus this one Dao. Though forms are separate, qi communicates; when qi communicates, nature and life communicate. In the extreme, all that Heaven covers and Earth bears is connected through the single breath of qi. If the Dao is within me, then I am its master. In its beginning, it possesses not a single thing; in its end, it omits not a single thing. Yet in its wondrous operation upon the ten thousand things, it still possesses not a single thing.

What Dao is this? It is the Dao of the True One. Perfecting oneself and perfecting things are both matters within the Dao. Only when the ten thousand things each rectify their nature and life is the full measure of the Dao realized. To leave the world and stand alone cannot be called the Dao—this is the origin of the teaching of *healing the world*.

The root canon of this teaching, the *Book of Healing the World*, possesses golden tablets and jade caskets, concealed within the celestial treasury, rarely seen in the world. This present book also contains expositions on the Confucian, Buddhist, and *healing-the-world* teachings. The Great Master Lü’s senior disciple, the Perfected Ancestor Wang Kunyang, heard from extraordinary persons that “the Confucian texts were destroyed in the Qin, the Buddhist texts in the Jin, and they cannot be seen in the world today.” What circulates in the world are merely the initial principles of the Daoist tradition’s *healing-the-world* practice.

When Ancestor Lü dwelled in the world, he received this teaching and expounded upon the meaning of the root canon, transmitting it to his dharma heirs. This is a commentary on the root canon, not the canon’s original text. Thus, its language is plain and easily understood, though it does not yet address the profound and subtle stages of practice within the canon. It merely sets forth the sequential steps for entering the Daoist tradition’s *healing-the-world* practice.

Its essentials, though distinct in method from the Confucian and Buddhist paths, converge in returning to the One. Thus, this book bears the name of the *Three Ni*. After Ancestor Lü ascended to the rank of Golden Immortal, he personally verified it with the Three Ni. These Three Ni, as celestial spirits, proclaimed the great Dao of participating in Heaven and Earth and aiding transformation and nourishment, enabling those with aspiration for this Dao to hear, transmit, and follow it, so that generation after generation may ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity.

Readers of this book must not treat it lightly! Though this book has been preserved in the world, it is unknown who took it away. When Ancestor Lü descended to the altar, he expounded its meaning in even greater detail, which I have respectfully transcribed here, adding a few words at the beginning.

Respectfully recorded on the first day of the year *jiǎchén* of the Kangxi era by Tao Taiding, ninth-generation successor of the Dragon Gate Orthodox Lineage, at the Dragon Peak Mountain Chamber of Golden Canopy.

Within the twelve hexagrams, when yang grows, yin diminishes; when yin arrives, yang is complete. Cycling through the twelve earthly branches, each corresponds to its qi, manifesting the imagery of yin and yang’s advance and retreat. The Dao undergoes change and movement; lines shift and interchange to form sixty-four hexagrams. Above and below are not constant; hardness and softness alternate. The sixty-four hexagrams do not exceed these twelve hexagrams. By extending and transforming them, one exhausts their changes. Observing the *Yi* through embodiment, the principles of the world are attained.

*Exposition on Healing the World*
*(Xie’s note: Only upon reaching the level of true fetal breathing and possessing pure and profound nature-work can one practice this *healing-the-world* technique; otherwise, harm may arise. Furthermore, when practicing this method, one must utterly abandon selfishness, or one will surely enter demonic paths. This method is none other than the supreme Golden Elixir Great Dao, the *Celestial Immortal’s Heart Transmission* practice recorded in this book. It should be studied together with the *Celestial Immortal’s Heart Transmission*.)*

Lü Zu, the Patriarch, was a descendant in the Daoist lineage of Guan Yinzi under the Supreme Lord (Taishang), and a great-great-grandson in the Dao transmission. Originally of the Tang imperial clan, his surname was Li, personal name Qiong, and courtesy name Boyu. To evade the calamity brought by Empress Wu, he and his wife née Jin concealed themselves in the deep valleys of Mount Song, changing their surname to Lü, with the personal name Yan and courtesy name Dongbin. After his wife’s untimely death, he took the sobriquet *Chunyang*—disciple of Patriarch Zhongli. Emperor Shizu of the Yuan dynasty bestowed upon him the honorific titles *Jinghua Fuyou Dijun*.

The Three Nis refer to Confucius, the Tathāgata, and Laozi. The *Heart Seal Scripture Collection* states:
*"The Green Ni embodies the center,
Zhongni (Confucius) harmonizes the mean,
Muni (the Buddha) abides in emptiness.
The Three Nis teach in succession,
Wenni (Laozi) assists in governance.
The Three Nis transmit flawlessly,
Wenni alone is praised.
Expounding and disseminating education,
they nurture the wellspring of transformation."*

This is the primordial decree addressed to Wenni.

The present scripture further declares:
*"The Perfected One of Pure Yang, known by the transformation-name Wenni, holds the office of doctrinal transformation. Thus, he was commanded to propagate the Way of the Three Nis and bestow it upon the world, secretly blessing the people below."*

Lü Zu’s synthesis of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism in his teachings was mandated by Heaven, which is why his precious invocation also designates him as the Teacher of the Three Teachings.

The *Exposition on Healing the World* embodies the profound essence of the Three Sages, fostering the growth of all things and ascending to the heights of Heaven. Since the dawn of creation, no Way in the world has surpassed this. Lü Zu expounded it to open boundless kalpas and extend the transformative blessings of nurturance, protection, kindness, and well-being. Though its initial principles belong to the Mystery Gate, they ultimately derive from the foundation of quiescence and stillness. Quiescence and stillness are the common entry points for all three traditions, yet the Daoist school’s methods are comparatively simple and easily understood—hence their selection for instruction. As for fully realizing one’s nature, comprehending destiny, and extending one’s merit to Heaven and Earth, the Three Nis share the same Way, all encompassed herein.

Lü Zu committed this to writing and transmitted it to his disciples. Treasured by successive patriarchs, it was preserved in the Dragon Ridge Mountain Chamber on Plum Island—a retreat originally established by the Perfected Master Huang Yin. The site remains, located approximately two *li* from Cloud Nest, on the eastern slope of Golden Canopy Peak. The original preface was composed by the Venerable Master Tao Shian, while the title was bestowed by the Perfected Master Yin. The designation *"Lü Zu’s Exposition on the Three Nis’ Healing of the World"* clarifies that this text is Lü Zu’s elucidation of the Three Sages’ original scripture, offered to instruct humanity.

**First Step in Expounding the Teaching: *Great Vigour***

[This exposition employs the imagery of the *Yijing* to elucidate each step of the practice, not merely to expound upon hexagram qi or temporal sequences. (Xie’s note: There is no true beginning—this is merely a pedagogical convenience, taking *Great Vigour* as the first step in expounding the teaching. In truth, there is neither start nor end, but an unbroken cycle.)]

*"Great Vigour: Auspicious for perseverance"*: "Great" signifies correctness, with inner *qian* and outer *zhen*. *Qian* is Heaven, the head; *zhen* is arousal, thus the practice begins here. *"The Lord emerges from zhen"*: The Lord is Taiyi, the true ruler of Unity. *Zhen* and *xun* transform to reveal the "many white eyes"—when the gaze is directed toward the brain, it turns upward, hence the whiteness, indicating one should fix attention upon the *qian* palace. *Zhen* is the movement of yang—intention is the issuance of the heart, the stirring of yang qi.]

(Xie’s note: *Qian* is the essence, *zhen* the function; through function, essence is revealed. The thunder of *Tianlei* shakes from below to above, and the Mysterious Pass opens.)

If one says: First close the eyes, gather the spirit of the eyes, and direct it toward the brain—(Xie’s note: Prolonged focus on the Upper Cinnabar Field unites spirit and qi, engaging the practice of merged oblivion.) [As recorded in *Kuizhong Shu*. The phrase "If one says" clarifies this is not part of the original scripture.]

The original scripture is terse and abstruse, difficult to comprehend. Patriarch Lü expounded its meaning, saying: "It is thus, it is thus." Master Tao’s version omits the phrase "若曰" ("if one says"), includes "微以" ("subtly with") in the following line, adds the character "際" ("boundary") after "脑" ("brain"), and renders "一注" ("a single focus") as "存守" ("preserve and guard"). Patriarch Lü stated: "To *preserve* is the True One; to *guard* is the True Origin." (Xie’s note: The True One cannot be guarded. To *preserve* is the intent of non-action, not *guarding*. The True Origin of the human body is true intention and true breath.) The True One is nature; the True Origin is *qi*. The brain is the Sea of Marrow and the capital of celestial nature—like the Jade Clarity’s sublime realm in the heavens, a realm of utmost purity, dwelling above the stars and moon, the Heaven of Great Nothingness. To know *preservation* and *guarding* is to naturally understand the Dao.

Proceeding within the brain, direct the focus upward toward the crown. (Xie’s note: Taking the Mud Pill Palace as the root and the crown as the "juncture," the five senses merge as one, body and mind blend in radiant transformation, engaging the work of emptiness beyond the body. Naturally, the wondrous function of *qi* arises from the formless.) [As recorded in *Kuizhong Shu*. Master Tao’s version renders "中" ("within") as "際" ("boundary"), adds "门上" ("above the gate") in the following line, and changes "注之" ("direct the focus") to "一注" ("a single focus"). Patriarch Lü said: "The brain is the Jade Clarity Palace of the human body, the abode of the Primordial Beginning. The crown is the fontanel, the acupoint *Baihui*, the gathering place of the Three Origins, where the True One of the Three Heavens above is received. Directing the focus upward toward the crown, the True One resonates, the True Origin converges, and one perceives red and yellow star-like specks raining down as verification." (Xie’s note: This is what *Tianxian Xinzhuang* calls "guiding the descent of the Celestial Stem.") For the True One is formless; what can be perceived is the True Origin. The True Origin is the *qi* born of the True One.]

(Yide’s note: The *Book of Rites* states: "It originates from the Great One, divides into Heaven and Earth, revolves into yin and yang, transforms into the four seasons, and arrays into ghosts and spirits. Its descent is called *ming*; its office is in Heaven." The Great One is the True One, the ruler of Heaven. The head is the Heavenly Gate of the human body, hence one must welcome *qian* at the head. The *Book of Changes* says: "*Qian*’s origin," and "emerging first among the myriad things"—*qian* is Heaven and the head. *Yu’s Commentary on the Book of Changes* states: "*Qian* is nature"—the nature of Heaven’s mandate. The eyes and heart "directing the focus" is what the *Book of Documents* calls "attending to Heaven’s bright mandate," which Master Zhu glossed as "constantly keeping one’s gaze upon it." The Buddhist scriptures say: "The Great Buddha’s Crown *Sūtra* of Dhāraṇī"—speaking of wisdom’s light like the sun at the Buddha’s crown. They also say: "This is the Tathāgata’s invisible crown, the formless mind-Buddha," and "rubbing the crown to awaken"—speaking of the light of human nature residing in the crown. The methods of world-saving practice in Confucianism and Buddhism, when compared with the scriptural principles here, align perfectly in purpose and form.)

(Xie’s note: The aim of this step is to purify one’s body and mind, attaining the state of "perfect purity," which is what Master Min called "in purity, one must welcome *qian*.")

This is the first step in practice. [As recorded in *Kuizhong Shu*. Master Tao’s version adds the words "功法" ("practice method") after each step. Patriarch Lü said: "Method is the rule; practice is its function." "First close the eyes"—the eyes are the emissaries of the heart’s *qi* and spirit. The *Dharma Record* states: "The eye spirit in Heaven becomes the two marshals, Gou and Bi." In the human body, when moving, it focuses on the two *Yongquan* points; when seated, it focuses on the two kidneys. "Closing" means concentration. "Subtly with" implies having as if not having. Intention is the command of the heart-spirit; when the command issues, it is executed, like an emperor’s edict. "Directing upward" implies piercing through the crown to ascend, thereby focusing on and welcoming the origin of the True One to protect the body and the world.]

The second step expounds the method.

The *Guài* hexagram [☵☷ (inner *qián*, outer *duì*). The *Yi Xiang* states: "*Qián* is spirit, *duì* is communication—communicating *qi* with spirit." This draws on the meaning of guiding the *qián* *qi* downward. *Guài* means "to decide," where the firm decides over the yielding; the Dao of the noble person grows while the Dao of the petty person wanes—the petty person refers to *yin*. The *quē* gate descends to communicate with the abdomen, and the abdomen is *yin*; thus, guiding the *qián* *yang* downward dissolves *yin*.

[**Xie’s note:** In terms of internal alchemy, this is the initial practice method of concentrating spirit into the *qi* cavity.]

It proceeds from *Bǎihuì*, descending to *Quēpén*.
[**Xie’s note:** The primordial *qi* emerges from emptiness and stillness; when stirred, it communicates, and once communicated, it is guided in accordance with its flow.]

[The *Kuìzhōng* text reads the same. Tao’s version has: "Continuing from the brain’s border, descending to the chest’s hall." *Bǎihuì* is an acupoint located at the crown. *Quēpén* is also an acupoint, situated in the chest. Patriarch Lü said: "Though intent is not mentioned here, it is implied within." "Descending" signifies the act of drawing and guiding the primordial origin downward; the meaning of the following passage will make this clear.]

] [**Xie’s note:** The practice of "turning the light around to reflect inward" gathers the true primordial origin into *Níwán*, then directly enters the *Zhōnghuáng*—this is the method of "releasing light to summon the scattered primordial unity" in the Dao of internal alchemy.]

*Qián*:
["*Yuán* (primordial beginning), *hēng* (free flow), *lì* (beneficial harmony), *zhēn* (upright constancy):
*Yuánshǐ* (primordial beginning) refers to the *Yì* returning to its initial state, delving into the profound to seek and guide, as all things draw upon this origin.
*Hēngtōng* (free flow) is the yang penetrating the yin.
Each aligning its nature and destiny constitutes *lìzhēn* (beneficial constancy).
The region above the heart is yang; the abdomen is yin.
The chest is the boundary where yang first communicates with yin,
[**Xie’s note:** This may also refer to the *Jiànggōng* cavity.]
from which the profound mysteries of the world arise—one must not be disturbed by agitation.
*Qián* conceals *kūn* within, governing movement with stillness, thereby embodying tranquil delight.
The virtues of *Qián* are: firmness, strength, centrality, uprightness, purity, essence, and refinement.
—These seven virtues enable one to awaken to the emptiness of form and phenomena, unattached to even a single thread.]

From *Quēpén*, one embodies tranquil delight.

<**Xie’s note:** Entering the chamber of spirit-return, at this moment one washes the heart and bathes in purity. The upper and middle *dantian* merge as one; heart and breath harmonize and fuse, the mysterious aperture fully opens. After a great repose, one abides in profound stillness—illuminating without illumination, the Great Ultimate first appears. The "Heavenly Immortal’s Heart Transmission" calls this "Perfect Clarity," utterly untainted by dust.>

[As in *Kuìzhōngshū*. Tao’s version reads: "Abide in the chamber of the breast, not a single thread attached." (Yīdé)
**Note:** The *Book of Changes* states, "Clarity and brightness reside in the body," <**Xie’s note:** The human heart has merged with the celestial heart.> while the *Heart Sutra* declares, "The five aggregates are all empty"—both speak of the same Dao.
Lü Zu said: "First, guard against impatience; second, guard against confusion; third, guard against recklessness. To recognize this *zhōng* <**Xie’s note:** In the narrow sense, this *zhōng* refers to the inner Mysterious Female, also called the Central Yellow Spirit-Chamber; in the broad sense, it is the 'heart' of Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Female of creation. Its secret lies in 'non-abiding and non-attachment.'> is to know that originally there is not a single thing. Where is self? Where is other? Where is inside or outside? Radiant and unobstructed, penetrating Heaven and Earth, each and every thing—only when the mechanism moves does it appear. Yet appearance is not the essence of the heart. When it appears, do not examine; when it withdraws, do not pursue—like a floating cloud touching the vast sky, it passes and is gone. What one should welcome is: preserve clarity to the utmost, harmoniously receive the Three and Five." For this stage, the *Cantong Qi* calls it "Supreme Virtue." Virtue consists of purity, emptiness, tranquility, and blandness, unstained by even a speck of dust. Whether gain or loss, being or non-being, one does not cling in the slightest—only then is the method attained.]

This marks the second step in the initial practice.

[Master Lü states: "At this stage, myriad and tumultuous visions will inevitably arise. (Xie’s note: Alchemical texts refer to this as the *living noon hour*.) Should one linger even slightly or become disturbed, the Celestial Ruler falls ill—this not only brings no benefit but inflicts no small harm. Moreover, the next step will then offer no foothold for progress. How can one not be vigilant!" (Yide)

I humbly submit: If one can embody the characters *you* (wandering) and *xian* (leisure), their meaning will naturally be grasped, and one’s practice will align with the ancestral teachings.]

(Xie’s note: Though the Qian trigram’s primordial force descends to govern this stage, this is the "center" of the human heart. With the ten thousand things teeming and the human heart intricate, tumultuous visions arise, and practitioners are prone to chasing illusions. If even the slightest trace of self-interest intrudes, harm may ensue. Thus, one must remain utterly unencumbered.)

The third step speaks of *Gou* (Encounter).
(Xie’s note: The movement returns to true noon, where *Guai* (Decisiveness) passes through *Qian* (Heaven) and reverts to *Gou*—the great work of reversal in the Dao of alchemy is now manifest! Its secret lies solely in "thought within non-thought.")

[Internally *Xun* (Wind), externally *Qian* (Heaven).]

The *Tuan* commentary states: "Gou (Encounter) means encounter—softness encounters hardness." Yin is soft. "When hardness encounters central correctness, the great Way prevails throughout the world," meaning hardness overcomes softness. The fifth line is centrally correct, thus hardness encounters central correctness. Yin begins to arise, so it is fitting to restrain and illuminate. *Gou* and *Fu* (Return) are mutually resonant: in *Fu*, both dragon and serpent lie dormant, while in the feminine sovereign, the ten thousand things flourish—such is the principle of yin and yang mutually concealing one another.

The *Xiang* commentary states: "Heaven and Earth encounter one another, and the forms of all things become manifest." Thus, all paths open simultaneously. "Beneath Heaven there is wind"—no path remains obstructed.

At this stage, when the movement reaches true noon, the key lies solely in diligent illumination.
(Xie’s note: At this point in the work, one is prone to scattering or torpor, so one must intensify focused awareness, maintaining an unbroken thread—this is what is meant by "thought within non-thought.")

[Kuizhong’s text concurs. The Tao edition adds the words "thereupon" at the beginning, and renders the following line as "all paths open simultaneously."
(Xie’s note: When the primordial spirit is fully awakened, body and world unite, and Heaven, Earth, the ten thousand things, and all people appear within the aperture. This speaks of the flourishing of the central movement of the primordial force—abundant and rich, nothing is lacking. Yet one must remain wary of the sun’s descent after noon and the moon’s waning after fullness, hence the need for restraining illumination. True noon corresponds in the world to the central primordial force, in the body to the heart, and in the stages of practice to the living noon hour—a time when the first trace of yin arises, thus requiring restraint and illumination.)]

*Dun* (Retreat) follows.

[Inner *Gen* (Mountain), outer *Qian* (Heaven). The Image states: "Heaven beneath has a mountain—*Dun* (Retreat). The noble one distances petty persons, not through aversion but through solemnity." The noble one refers to *Qian*; *Qian* is distant and solemn. At *wei* (the eighth Earthly Branch), its position is already remote—remote yet solemn, this is the Way of rectifying the root and purifying the source. With yang rightfully positioned while yin gradually grows, the image of imbalance arises.]

At *wei*’s zenith, rectify the root and purify the source.
<Xie’s note: From the *Gou* hexagram to the *Bo* hexagram, what manifests is the world’s karmic landscape from "the present" to "the future." In a single moment, it appears within the mysterious aperture. Those of shallow cultivation may perceive only one to several years of worldly fate; those of deep cultivation see ten, a hundred, or a thousand years in an instant. The shallow practitioner’s *qi* encompasses a village or county; the profound, a province, a nation, or even the world entire. By the time of *Kun*, the ten thousand things return to stillness in profusion. This secret holds no other principle—only that the primordial spirit must not be lost. One contracts body and mind into the Central Yellow Ancestral Aperture, merging them into emptiness and chaos. The work of healing the world begins here: with rectified intention, one prevents the scene of cold decline from becoming excessive.>

[Kuizhong’s text is identical. Tao’s edition reads "若" (*ruo*, "if") for "已" (*yi*, "already"), and "便有偏颇" ("then imbalance arises"), for this is where the people forget goodness. When the world has long been at peace, people grow complacent in ease. Complacent in ease, they forget goodness; forgetting goodness, the seeds of evil lie hidden—this is the natural course. One must embody the phrase "rectify the root and purify the source" to find a place to begin. My humble opinion: the secret lies in welcoming the One to transform it, not merely in welcoming *Kun*’s primordial force.]

*Pi* (Obstruction) follows.

[Within, *Kun*; without, *Qian*. The *Tuan* says: "Heaven and Earth do not interact, and the myriad things do not communicate. Within are petty men; without, noble gentlemen." Thus, strength without belies hollowness within. "Greatness departs, smallness arrives"—this is the time for cultivation and nourishment, for it is the sign of Heaven and Earth’s closure and obstruction.]

Once entering *shen-zheng*, only cultivation and nourishment remain.

[Kuizhong’s text is identical. Tao’s edition reads below *shen-zheng*: "Strength without, hollowness within—one must engage in cultivation and nourishment." The meaning aligns with this text. For when *shen-zheng* arrives, the cycle stands at the beginning of the lower epoch. At this time, the people, long settled in ease, have made indolence their nature. They know no striving, harbor no foresight, and the prevailing *qi* is frivolous and extravagant, their conduct dominated by ornament. Thus it is called "strength without." Yet the people’s lives are abundant, their *qi* already dispersed, and the hundred products gradually exhausted—thus it is called "hollowness within." Should calamity suddenly strike, they will risk all in desperation, only hastening their ruin. Truly, it is lamentable. (Xie’s note: In a single thought, heaven or hell.) Those who aspire to this Dao must take cultivation and nourishment as their sole task, thereby anticipating peril and preventing it.]

*Guan* follows.

[Inner Kun, outer Xun. The Image states: “Wind moves over the earth—*Guan*. The former kings thereby inspected the regions, observed the people, and established teachings.” *Guan* governs the transformation of the people, and thus must bring forth renewal. With the five positions unchanged, it is called “Great *Guan* above.” Near to the Qian line, it thus welcomes Qian. The Tao edition reads “accomplishing the worthy kalpa,” for within the hexagram of the You hour lie *Jian* and *Mingyi*, marking the hardship of the epoch.]

Should one encounter You-zheng, the secret lies solely in bringing forth renewal. (Xie’s note: Only extinguish the mind of discrimination, not the mind of illumination—let the light of Qian’s primordial origin at the crown merge with the radiance of the eyes and heart, shining downward. This is the method of supplementary practice, detailed in the first step. In sum, it is a matter of “harmony at the center.” If one is already “harmony at the center,” there is no need to add a head upon a head.)

[The *Kuizhong* text concurs; the Tao edition reads beneath “You-zheng”: “the secret lies in welcoming Qian to accomplish the worthy kalpa.” This aligns with the present text. You-zheng marks the middle phase of the lower epoch, where old stains and corrupt customs prevail. One welcomes the *qi* of Qian to sweep them clean, enabling the people to renew themselves. Yet the obstinate and slanderous still seek to arise together—if the people renew themselves, the coming kalpa’s disasters will be transformed from great to small, which is what is meant by the “worthy kalpa.” How vastly different from the devastation of war and fire! Lü Zu surely harbored profound intent here. What is the worthy kalpa? It is famine, pestilence, epidemics, and deluges.]

*Bo* follows.

[Within *Kun*, without *Gen*—this is the hexagram *Shu* (Decay). The *Qian Zao Du* states: “The Yin, in its injurious course, corresponds to the ninth month’s season, when yang *qi* wanes and recedes, yet Yin ultimately cannot exhaust Yang.” (Xie’s note: The crux lies in the phrase “cannot exhaust Yang,” for it is through this that *Bo* (Decay) passes through *Kun* (Earth) to return to the hexagram *Fu* (Return) at the correct *zi* hour—thus the great work of reversal in the Dao of the Elixir is once more revealed!) “The petty man cannot overpower the noble man.” It is called *Bo* (Decay), meaning only that stability is lost.

The *Tuan* says: “Unfavorable to proceed; the petty man waxes.”]

*Kun*
[All six lines are Yin—this is the hexagram of *Hai*. Its virtue is yielding compliance and steadfast integrity; its *qi* is extinguished in *gui*, the image of utter darkness, where Yang is wholly consumed. Hence the oracle: “Tread on frost, and solid ice will come.”

*Shu* and *Hai* form *Bo* and *Kun*, yet here it is said: “The method lies in *Zhun* (Difficulty) and *Meng* (Ignorance), awaiting *Fu* (Return).” Setting aside the hexagram of the present time, it speaks instead of “acting in accord with the moment’s use,” meaning that at this time, one must only rest and nurture. For *Shu* and *Hai* correspond to the lower extremity of the body and the lower epoch of the lower cycle—whether within or without, all must rest and nurture.]

(Xie’s note: The secret lies in spirit and breath interdependent, spirit and *qi* united, spirit returning to the belly of *Kun*—a great rest, yet not torpor, not Yang sinking into Yin, not Yang buried in Yin, but the image of primordial chaos. In the Dao of the Elixir, torpor must be strictly avoided at this stage.)

When the cycle reaches *Shu* and *Hai*, the method lies solely in *Zhun* and *Meng*, awaiting *Fu*.

[The *Kuizhong* manuscript agrees. The *Tao* edition renders the latter phrase as “merely *Zhun* and *Meng*.” Its meaning differs not from this text. *Zhun* and *Meng* are the images of all things in dark obscurity, to be nurtured only in anticipation of their return. *Zhun* is inner *Zhen* (Thunder) and outer *Kan* (Water): movement encountering peril, its karmic course beset by hardship—thus *Zhun* benefits from steadfast integrity. *Meng* is inner *Kan* and outer *Gen* (Mountain): *Kan*’s wisdom and *Gen*’s stillness, the numinous nature obstructed, its mechanisms and apertures unopened—thus *Meng* nurtures correctness. In the great epoch’s *Shu* and *Hai*, all things rest; in the lesser epoch’s *Shu* and *Hai*, nurturing the primordial *qi* is likewise precious. Ancestor Lü said: “Tracing the cause of this condition, it arises entirely from loss of illumination and loss of cultivation.” This speaks to the lesser epoch’s potential for redress in advance.

(Yide’s note: The *Book of Changes* states, “The Way of all increase moves in accord with the time”; the *Book of Documents* says, “The Dao has ascent and descent, governance transforms with custom”—this is Confucianism’s view of adversity and prosperity in the cosmic epochs as a means to heal the world. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* declares, “Pure and luminous, it illumines the world; with unimpeded vows, it abides through all kalpas, ever diligently benefiting all beings”; the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, “Through kalpas as numerous as the Ganges’ sands, it saves the world and brings all to peace”—this is Buddhism’s traversal of epochs without measure as a means to heal the world.)]

This is the third step in the initial practice.

[Note: The preceding text originally included the line *"Lüzu states: ‘In examining the cause of this, it is entirely due to the loss of illumination and cultivation.’"* (seventeen characters). As no other passages in the preceding or following text are attributed to Lüzu, this was likely added later when the book was presented to Lüzu, and the copyist mistakenly incorporated it into the main text. It has now been moved to the preceding annotation.]

Privately considering this work: the first two steps, from the crown to the chest, speak of the body without reference to the world. In the third step, the division into six periods reflects that when the practice reaches the *wu* (Noon) position, it pertains to the heart—ruler of the body and ruler of the world. From *wei* (1–3 PM) onward, it pertains to the abdomen and to Jambudvīpa. As worldly affairs differ, so too do the methods of redress; thus, each period is analyzed separately to clarify the application suited to the epoch. The function of these six periods concerns the work of learning and inquiry: one must enrich the Dao and its methods in times of non-application. From *wu*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, to *hai* (Noon to Midnight), each welcomes and aligns with the infusion of *Qian* (Heaven). *Qian* is the sovereign. Only after mastering the learning of redressing the world in accord with the time can one bear the weight of this world; only after harmonizing the primordial and aiding transformation can one ascend to rectify the sovereign’s heart.

To engage in the work of benefiting the people, one must first take the enlightenment of the ruler as the primary task.

**[Fourth Step of Exposition]**
*Return* [☳ *Zhen* within, ☷ *Kun* without. *Zhen* is cultivation, introspection, and the attainment of fortune; *Kun* is virtue harmonizing without bound. The *Tuan* states: “*Fu* (Return) is smooth; the firm returns in movement and proceeds with compliance. Beneficial to have somewhere to go—this is the growth of the firm.” The yang returns to its origin and accords with the celestial movement; the yin complies with it, revealing the convergence of clarity and goodness.]
Thereupon, the flower blooms to reveal the Buddha—self-created auspicious convergence. For ten thousand years, this is the fourth step of commencement.

**[Textual Variants and Annotations]**
In the *Kuizhong* manuscript, the *Tao* edition reads “既乃” (*thereupon*) instead of “已而” (*thereafter*), with two additional lines: “别有妙用，不外忠贞” (*There is a wondrous function, none other than loyalty and steadfastness*). Below “自造庆会” (*self-created auspicious convergence*), it includes “得致” (*attains*).
*Flower* refers to the flower of the heart-Buddha, a metaphor for the ruler. *Blooming* signifies the opening of the heart to reveal sincerity—within, there is no rigid self or obstinate intent; one follows the moment to guide and enlighten, rectifying what is amiss through awakening, as if a red furnace melting snow with divine efficacy.
“None other than loyalty and steadfastness” means that loyalty and steadfastness unify all in one virtue, fostering mutual trust between above and below without need for words or texts—hence “self-created,” the penetration of sincerity. Loyalty ensures inner and outer consistency; steadfastness ensures diligence day and night. Thus, one can fill the air with solemn harmony. Ruler and minister alike exist within this single *qi*; the former embodies virtue, the latter the people. The four seas and all living beings unknowingly receive its blessings.
As Ancestor Lü said: “Only those who know how to welcome the One and the primordial can achieve this.”
**[Citations]**
The *Book of Documents* states: “Harmonizing yin and yang, reverently illuminating Heaven and Earth.”
The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: “In great bodhi, one attains thorough penetration, awakening to the Tathāgata and exhausting the Buddha’s realm.”
The *Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World* states: “Benefiting and bringing peace to all sentient beings.”
All share this same function.

**[Fifth Step of Exposition]**

At this stage [☱☶ (Inner Duì, Outer Kūn). Duì represents joy, Kūn compliance—thus, no disjunction. *Yuan heng li zhen*. The *Tuan* states: “Joyful and compliant, firm in the center and responsive.”—“Joyful and compliant” is the origin of primordial unity; “firm in the center and responsive” is the wondrously congealed virtue, great penetration through correctness.]

At this moment, merit attains seamless continuity; every action and measure aligns without deliberation, for the two *qi* have merged as one, will and spirit undivided—this is the divine verification of wondrous congealment. This is the fifth step in practice. **[Xie’s note: Floating within the compass of regulation, fetal breathing nurtures the true, Qian and Kun merge as one.]**

**[Collation Notes]**
The *Kuizhong* manuscript and Tao edition are identical; the *Wenzheng Zang* edition contains minor variations.
Ancestor Lü said: “At this step, one must increasingly forget self and other, allowing the upright *qi* of Qian and Kun to billow like mist, vast as heaven and earth—only then does this verification arise. Should discordant tendencies occasionally appear, one must welcome the human *yuan* to harmonize them, double the welcome to Qian *yuan* to renew them, and Kūn *yuan* to soften them. With quiescent embodiment of the true One, all unifies naturally: the ruler becomes sagely, ministers virtuous, above and below share a single *qi*, and merit never slackens. The attainment of grand harmony is but days away.” **[Yide’s note]**
As the *Book of Documents* states: “All share a single virtue.”
The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: “Because it lacks merit and virtue, the Tathāgata speaks of abundant merit and virtue.”
All are of this same Dao. **[Xie’s note: In the human body, the human *yuan* is the true yang of fetal breathing, the harmonized *qi* of heart and kidney. Qian *yuan* is the divine fire at Baihui; Kūn *yuan* is the primordial *qi* of the sea bottom at Yongquan, the fire of Kun. When these three merge as one, returning to primordial chaos, and one embodies them in quiescence, the “true” that governs these three “appears”—hence, the true One.]**

**[Sixth Step of Exposition]**
**Peace [☰☶ (Inner Qian, Outer Kūn).**
The *Tuan* states: “Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their wills align.”
The *Xiang* states: “The lord thereby completes the Dao of Heaven and Earth, assists the proper timing of Heaven and Earth, and thereby guides the people.”
Yin assists yang, Kun receives Qian’s mandate—this is the image of all undertakings flourishing, the four seas at peace.]

At this stage of merit, the court radiates harmony, all officials display brilliance, and the people’s concerns are fully known to the ruler.

Then proceed to further welcome the true One—***(Xie’s note: In terms of the human body, this is "gathering the medicine.")***—its radiance descending to illuminate all directions. Next, welcome the primal power of Kun to nurture it—***(Xie’s note: Nurturing the true with embryonic breathing.)***—and the primal power of Qian to unify it—***(Xie’s note: Sealing and securing with the fire of spirit.)*** ***Xie’s note: Earthly *qi* ascends, heavenly *qi* descends, merging in the Central Yellow.*** Thus, the products of the earth proliferate, and the people’s conduct becomes pure and docile. This is the sixth step of practice. ***Xie’s note: When Heaven and humanity unite as one, the true One of Wuji appears, and the Great Ultimate spontaneously generates and transforms itself. My embryonic breathing intertwines and yearns with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, circulating in misty transformation. The hundred vessels and myriad apertures flow in ceaseless motion—this is what is meant by *"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things."* In terms of the world’s fortunes, this brings great peace under Heaven, pure and upright customs among the people, abundant resources, and the upper and lower classes communicating as one *qi*.*** (The character 驯 should read 良.)

[The *Kuizhong* manuscript and Tao’s edition are identical here; the *Wenzheng Zang* edition contains additional text that is not fully transcribed. (Yide’s note)]

As the *Book of Rites* states: “Virtue is the essence of human nature, reaching to Heaven above and coiling through Earth below, moving through yin and yang and penetrating the realm of ghosts and spirits.” When its efficacy reaches this point, Heaven and Earth align, the four seasons proceed in due order, the *Gen* trigram radiates virtue, and the five grains flourish. The *Book of Songs* says: “Truly, this noble one has achieved great completion”—this is the unity of the inner and outer Way.

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: “The Buddha declared that what is not the body is called the great body, for it contains the great thousand worlds within a single grain.” The *Amitābha Sūtra* says: “In the land of Amitābha Buddha, sentient beings know no suffering but only receive every joy; hence it is called *Ultimate Bliss*.” All these speak of the Dao residing in the individual while its effects extend to all beings—this is the boundless pattern of bestowing and granting.

The world-saving Way of the Confucian and Buddhist traditions is likewise encompassed within this text. As Master Lü said: “This is the ultimate achievement in governing the world, the highest capacity of the sage—yet it does not depend on anything external. The six directions and nine provinces are all contained within the womb of *Kun*; breath can connect them.” [Xie’s note: This refers to the breathing of Heaven-and-human unity, the great embryonic respiration of their harmonious union. However, one must not fixate on the *Kun*-womb as merely the physical abdomen.]

All people can cultivate this; the key lies in unwavering resolve and the strict avoidance of acting on private cleverness.

He also said: “Heaven and Earth have no mind of their own; they entrust their mind to humanity. Thus, when people act, their actions must bear fruit.” And further: “Know that the fortunes of the world rise and fall through upper, middle, and lower phases, just as a person passes through youth, prime, and old age. No one wishes to remain forever old, so how could Heaven and Earth not desire to remain forever in their upper and middle states? The perfected one embodies this truth and thus leaves this teaching for those of resolute aspiration. Yet there is a principle most profound, which has never been fully revealed throughout the ages.

Long ago, I first heard this teaching and privately awaited its fulfillment. Only after attaining the Dao in full completion did I realize that my earlier efforts had been insufficient. Now, I can only transmit this teaching [the phrase “transmit this” indicates that these are not the original words of the scripture but the Master’s exposition for the benefit of others] to those who will follow in its footsteps. You, my disciples, should not press for exhaustive inquiry [given the vastness of this scripture’s Way, even immortals do not hear its entirety; how could ordinary people demand to scrutinize its secret records? The Master’s compassion allows us to hear this transmission—is this not a blessing earned over three lifetimes?].

Now, I will explain in detail the foundational means by which this can be achieved [clearly, the earlier portion of the scripture contains further practices of cultivation; the following describes the essential basis for attainment]. Thus he said:

*The Kinship of the Three* and *The Awakening to Reality* suffice to perfect destiny; *The True Words of the Dao-Chanting* suffices to perfect nature; *The Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* suffices to transform the mundane; *The Three Nīla’s World-Saving* suffices to verify fruition. Yet among these, *The Kinship* and *Awakening* contain many hidden secrets and are easily misinterpreted, leading one astray.

*The Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* is concise yet comprehensive in its principles, transforming the *qi*-nature with extraordinary efficacy. When supplemented by *The True Words of the Dao-Chanting* to refine the mind, the Three Treasures become pure and refined. Then, one may study *The Kinship* and *Awakening* to perfect destiny, and *The World-Saving* to verify fruition.

As for verifying fruition—what practice could surpass that expounded in *The Three Nīla’s World-Saving*? Alas!

A wronged village woman may halt the rains for three years—such is the power of misfortune, and so too is the power of fortune. I have personally witnessed this confirmed in the "Three Nīla" texts, all attesting: so it is, so it is.

The "Three Nīla" further state: "One whose cultivation of nature is imperfect will find verification impure; one whose cultivation of destiny is imperfect will find attainment unstable; one whose *qi*-nature remains unrefined will find efficacy unspiritual. Only when the Three Treasures are fully perfected and one returns to the primordial can the practice be entrusted to others."

This is the most profound of profound principles—one I had never heard before. Now, you may awaken to it. Otherwise, how careless are the two great forces in their self-governance! How negligent are the myriad sages in their shared reverence! Is this not the greatest enigma since the dawn of life?

From this day forward, seize the years, months, and days of this life. Practice diligently without slack, perfecting this mortal form to verify fruition—is this not fitting?

Yet to cure illness, one must know its source. Without knowing the source, how can one begin? The two great forces are without mind or desire. Yet they cherish life, and where life proliferates, scarcity follows.

In medicine, there is the method of supplementing the child when the mother is ailing, and the mother when the child is ailing. To preserve the ultimate and renew the people—this is one method. To cherish the people and repel calamity—this is another.

Only in this *World-Saving* practice does there exist a cyclical remedy, infinitely efficacious, costing not a coin, expending not a thread of effort, achieved through stillness. Its merit is perfected, and one ascends. Compared to the three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds that require human effort, is it not better to rely on a single thought, freely wielding mastery with a method neither cumbersome nor complex? To squander years in vain—is this not delusion?

The time is now, the time is now—do not wait!" —This was expounded in the third year of Daoguang.

Moreover, it is said: "When the two great *Primordials* are restored, all things flourish and humankind is good. When humankind is good, all things flourish; when all things flourish, humankind is good. Is this not the prosperity of the age?

<*Xie’s further note*: The two great *Primordials* refer to the *Primordials* of *Qian* and *Kun*. In the human body, one who attains the *Primordial of Qian* experiences the arising of yang in *nature*—this is the opening of the *Mysterious Pass of Nature*, also called the *Upper Mysterious Pass*. One who attains the *Primordial of Kun* experiences the arising of yang in *destiny*—this is the opening of the *Mysterious Pass of Destiny*, also called the *Lower Mysterious Pass*. In truth, there is only *one* "Mysterious Aperture," yet its manifestation varies according to each person’s capacity, cultivation, and circumstances. When the *Mysterious Aperture* is fully opened, *nature* and *destiny* unite, the two *Primordials* merge as one, self and other dissolve, and the *True One* appears. Abiding in the *One*, the *One* spontaneously transforms and generates life—this is what is meant by "when the *One* aperture opens, all apertures open."

The method of *World-Saving* consists in but eight characters: *"Emptiness, stillness, merging, transformation—no thought within thought."* The crux lies in *"no thought within thought,"* which is to say, *"When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit,"* or again, *"The thought is the True One."* First, release to the utmost; then, gather to the utmost. From the radiance of release, turn inward to introspection. The utmost of gathering is nothing more than the *Great Void*; the utmost of release is nothing more than the *Great Void*. Release is not truly release; gathering is not truly gathering.>

Does this not embody the principle of mutual healing? Why then hesitate?

In ancient times, on Mount Guye (pronounced *Yi*), the divine person surnamed Xu, named Jing, styled Ziyou, established the healing of the two *Primordials* during the reigns of Yao and Shun. As a result, the floodwaters were pacified, and the Miao people submitted—is this not clear proof? (This is also recorded in the *Dialogues of Ge and Lu*.)

Even more remarkable is the *Dhāraṇī of Upholding the World* preached by the Buddha, personally transmitted to the elder Miaoyue in the kingdom of Jiao Mi. To this day, the Western Regions continue to benefit from its blessings, as attested in the Buddhist scriptures (also cited in Peng Chimu’s *Random Notes on the Buddhist Canon*).

How can the merit and virtue of such deeds be measured?

The lineage of our school has seen only the Seven Masters of the Northern Tradition attain the fruit of immortality through this Dao. Yet it is a path open to all. Formerly, without the august decree of the Jade-Pure Divine Mother, it was kept secret and never dared to be revealed. Now, however, having received Her sacred mandate, proclamations have descended through the Three Heavens, universally enjoining the Three Realms to permit its transmission and reception, without distinction of male or female. The Three Heavens and Three Realms shall guard and protect day and night; those who sincerely uphold it shall receive response upon invocation, and no demonic forces shall dare to interfere. Truly, this is an encounter unparalleled since the dawn of creation—a supreme fortune for the workings of fate, and a boundless blessing for countless generations to come.

Yet it is essential that there be those who lead by personal example. The remaining secrets hinge upon attaining union with the True One as their foundation, while all cultivation begins with the practice of *embryonic respiration*. I know this Dao shall not remain forever hidden, and thus in former times I descended to expound and record these teachings, which have been preserved in the Dragon Ridge Mountain Chamber of this very mountain. Now, I reveal them fully and without reservation. You who receive these words must reverently adhere to them, taking care never to harbor even the slightest expectation of immediate results—for the principle is thus, and the Dao is thus.

Such was the instruction of Ancestor Lü. Those who are devoted to this Dao, upon reading this text, will surely awaken to what they have not yet awakened, embodying and practicing it with diligence. May the Three Nuns silently bear witness.

This compilation (*Yide*) gathers the surviving instructions of Ancestor Lü and elucidates the original intent of this text. The remainder is largely drawn from the *Inner Collection of the Orthodox Tradition of Heavenly Immortals* compiled and edited by Minister Jiang Yuanting. In his postscript, the Minister writes: “I have heard that on Mount Wuhua in Yunnan, there is a *Scripture on the Ancestral Master’s Healing of the World*, which appears to align with the profound meanings set forth in the *Inner Collection*. Though I have sought it extensively, it remains unobtained. If found, I intend to place it at the head of the *Inner Collection*, for it must contain essential mysteries. Its absence from the *Daoist Canon* is a grievous omission.”

(*Yide*) privately surmises that what the Minister heard may refer to the version from Mount Jizu, though his account seems based on hearsay, hence the mention of such a scripture. However, upon examining the original preface by Master Tao, it is clear that the secrets are not part of the scriptural text, and the title *Ancestor Lü’s Healing of the World* is also erroneous. This note is made in anticipation of further verification.

(*Yide*) respectfully records.

+++ **Postscript to *Master Lü’s Three Nis’ Formula for Healing the World***

The block-printed edition in my case originally contained no hexagram diagrams. The manuscript copy I obtained from the Zhu family, however, includes hexagrams preceding each step. Some suspect these were later additions by Daoist practitioners. I maintain that the manuscript has circulated for generations and should not be altered; thus, I have annotated the hexagram meanings while preserving them.

Others have questioned: “The world’s afflictions are manifold, and the art of healing it admits many methods—averting drought and flood, dispelling pestilence, suppressing warfare, eradicating disease, rescuing from fire and drowning, and warding off great disasters. Such tasks demand vast spiritual potency and mighty dharmic power, the deployment of talismans and mantras, responses as boundless as the needs themselves. Yet this text proposes a single method to cure all ills—is this not overly simplistic? Or does the full work contain all methods, which you have not yet seen?”

I replied: “What you describe are *techniques*; this text speaks of the *Dao*. I am certain it does not discuss techniques. Those who grasp the profound Dao disdain illusions like striking stones to summon chess pieces. Those who wield divine mechanisms scorn tricks like waving fans to reverse wind or pouring wine to summon rain. Could the great Dao of the sages ever be adulterated with mere arts? It is true I have not seen the complete text; but I do not believe the full work contains such techniques. The versions I have seen differ in wording, and rumors vary still. Who is to say some eccentric has not surreptitiously inserted talismans and incantations from other texts, leading readers to mistake them for the original? Error begets error, flowing into the realm of occult arts, deceiving and deluding. Such corruptions should be burned.”

They pressed: “Yet disasters are manifold—can one doctrine truly address them all? Or must we resign ourselves to inaction?”

I answered: “You do not understand the Dao and are fixated on techniques. Techniques are small; the Dao is vast—beyond your comprehension. All worldly afflictions arise from the excesses of the Five Phases’ *qi*. Within our own bodies resides the upright *qi* of the Five Phases, corresponding to the five directions. By diagnosing the source of affliction and attacking the affected direction, we harmonize the world’s *qi* with our own. Internally, we perceive no self; externally, no others. Excess is reduced; deficiency is replenished. Stagnation is dispersed; rigidity is transformed. Reversal is corrected. Though diseases are innumerable and healing arts inexhaustible, the regulation of *qi*—its waxing and waning—must be tailored to each condition. When a person is ill, we mobilize the yin-yang transformations of our own body. When the world is ill, we likewise regulate it through our body’s yin-yang. Swift yet effortless—how wondrous! Yet this is not something ordinary people can achieve. It is the primordial *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun*, the True Unity. By reverently preserving it, response follows as echo to sound. Moreover, when the great Dao prevails, why wait for calamity to act? Why merely patch imbalance and salvage ruin? Those who grasp this principle will not be misled by talismans, incantations, or numerological arts.”

Master Lü’s earlier *Three Nis’ Discourse on Healing the World* was once in my possession, and I annotated it. However, the *Formula* was incomplete. The *Formula* volume was obtained from Elder Taixu, who stated that the *power* resides in the divine holding of the Jade Scripture, while the *formula* begins with the *Mystic Store Mantra*. The text was later taken by a friend, and forty years passed before I recovered it. I have now recompiled and personally annotated it, adding invocations to clarify its application. Thus, the *Formula* and *Power* are now complete. Not for private gain, I humbly share this with fellow practitioners.

**Mystic Store Mantra**

Cloud-seal of the Great Void,
At the dawn of kalpas,
Now distant, now near,
Now sunken, now floating.
Wandering the Five Directions,
Beyond a *zhang*’s span.

**Annotation to the Formula:** The master’s instruction to compile the *Mystic Store* is to guide practitioners in directing their minds to the origin of things. Before our forms took shape, we were of one body with the Great Void—like cloud-seals at the kalpa’s beginning, drifting near and far, floating and sinking across the Five Directions, yet never beyond the *zhang*-square of the celestial heart. Upon embodying form, we initially retain our true primordial *qi*. Later, as external things entangle us and the discriminating mind takes control, we forget to return. Over time, habitual defilements accumulate, leaving us no leisure even to seek healing—how then could we practice this formula? Thus, I urge those who aspire to this path to first investigate things and extend knowledge, sincerely rectifying their intentions. Only with sincere intention can one study this. Before holding the scripture, recite this mantra to renew mind and eye, returning to our origin. This prevents the discriminating mind from gaining foothold, securing the original destiny and calming the heart. Once settled, the true primordial *qi* is restored. Only then can the cloud-seal pervade the Great Void—proof of movement arising from supreme stillness. Yet this movement is spontaneous, drifting near and far, floating and sinking, unsettled. As a thing, it is utterly empty, utterly numinous, now hidden, now manifest. Once the Five Directions reveal their signs and the Great Void bears cloud-seals, images may be derived and texts composed. Though additions and omissions may occur, the *zhang*-square of the celestial heart remains unfathomable—this is the principle of movement without departing from the ultimate. It is like saying: our heart never strays from the square inch.

The square inch is the heart. The human heart is called the "square inch," while the celestial heart is called the "square *zhang*."

The Heavenly Perfected One respectfully examines the Daoist canon: in heaven, this is the Heavenly Perfected One; in humans, it is the original destiny and primordial spirit. Taking up the brush to inscribe, one unfolds the *Dongzhang*—the *Dongzhang* being the Jade Scripture, the text that generates heaven, earth, and all beings. The Perfected One, as the primordial truth, thus embodies and unfolds the scripture. In human terms, this is the enlightened spirit of prior awakening. Before signs manifest, the spirit first awakens—this is the true purport of the Jade Scripture, from which scholars must not deviate.

Next, inscribe the numinous talismans. These are the words of the *Dongzhang*, which the Perfected One divides and writes, each character becoming a talisman. The Primordial Beginning descends, and the true scripture spreads forth. This Primordial Beginning is the celestial spirit of the Primordial Dharma King, the essence of the Three Powers’ true unity. The "true scripture" below refers to the sacred teachings born of the Three Powers, the sagely instructions flowing with the times—these are the scriptures of the Three Teachings. Luminous yet existent, obscure yet nonexistent: all are born and transformed by the true unity, manifesting as wondrous being and wondrous nonbeing, two yet one. Thus, all is encompassed by this character.

Illness may heal itself, and worldly toil and drowning can be rescued. Worldly afflictions arise half from human affairs and half from adverse fate, so they cannot be cured by medicine alone. Worldly toil stems half from habitual defilement and half from innate *qi*-endowment, so it cannot be sustained by authority or favor. Only by embracing the One, refining and transforming, can illness heal itself and drowning be rescued. Those who aspire to renew themselves and others must diligently embody and practice this.

Both the hidden and the manifest depend on it, and thus one ascends to the Pure Capital. The hidden is the way of earth, the obscure; the manifest is the virtue of heaven, the luminous. The human body encompasses both—this is the body and heart. Only those who know the bright yet guard the dark, know the male yet guard the female, may use it without bias, so that both hidden and manifest are upheld. The Pure Capital is the celestial abode of the Three Pure Ones. "Ascend" means to level. By following the One and drawing the One, refining and transforming, one naturally levels and attains the Pure Capital. This reveals the wondrous function of the true unity: the character in the previous line directly connects to the character here.

This is the Treasure of Primordial Destiny, impervious to eons of erosion. If one constantly recites it, one’s generation will become a companion to heaven. Here, "generation" refers specifically to the individual. The Treasure of Primordial Destiny is the single stroke within *Kan*, rising from the sea bottom, piercing the tailbone, threading the spine to reach the brain, transforming into the royal infant, suspended at the celestial cover bone. When it circulates to the Central Palace and *qi* converges, it forms a full moon, and the heart reveals the cinnabar-red characters of the Celestial Stem—ultimately, the gathering of the central generative *qi*. In heaven, this is the Star of Stability, towering above the sun and moon, the essence of earth ascending to form its image. As *qi*, it is supremely centered and upright, at once utterly firm and utterly benevolent. The *Daoist Canon* states: where it infuses, transformation occurs; where it stabilizes, rectification follows. Its light revolves with the Dipper, its heart never straying from the ultimate. This means its heart is steadfast, like the pivot of a millstone. Thus, the Central Palace remains perpetually settled. In our generation’s healing of the world, when the heart’s affairs align with stability, the Stem’s *qi* naturally descends. Therefore, the physical form must be upright, like standing atop a mountain peak, gazing into the vast emptiness. For stability is like the sun, ascending to the celestial verge, requiring no human effort to radiate its light throughout the body. Only when body and heart are empty and still will the countenance shine. If one practices thus, the body becomes like fine silk or a valley, transparent within and without—this arises only when the Central Palace reaches the extreme of emptiness and stillness. Moreover, one must not cling to the luminous but also heed the obscure. Once the body attains purity and harmony, viewing it as if innate, the heart remains unmoved—this is attaining purity and harmony without attachment to form. Further, if one can forget even this provisional method, one enters perfect realization. Yet if one forgets even this expedient, one falls into the naturalistic heterodoxy, either scattered or torpid. This is why the ancients relied on the Treasure of Primordial Destiny. For the Treasure of Destiny is the true unity of one’s body; using the One to stabilize, the heart becomes settled. Now, in embodying Lüzu’s use of the Jade Scripture to harmonize the heart, its purport is even more profound, its function even more subtle. My teacher employed it to assist the Treasure of Destiny, ascending to welcome and descending to infuse, the entire being empty and numinous—its efficacy is especially divine. For the Jade Scripture is the essence of the Three Powers’ true unity, and the Treasure of Destiny is the heaven-bestowed true unity. When the One draws the One, being and nonbeing mutually dissolve and transform—how could the world not be governed? Yet only those of utmost sincerity and unceasing effort can achieve this. Thus it is said: "If one constantly recites it, one’s generation will become a companion to heaven." Such is the ancient sages’ admonition. This means that though the Jade Scripture is numinous, it is even more crucial that recitation never cease.

Careful examination reveals that the Jade Scripture’s text concludes at *"yao xi ming qi"* (耀息命炁), while the subsequent passages enumerate the names of later patriarchs across the three great teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—these are not part of the original scripture.

The scriptural text emerged at the dawn of the kalpa, before heaven, earth, or beings existed. It first manifested as clouds and mist filling the void, known as the *Mysterious Seal Script* (玄篆). The Primordial Sovereign (先天皇人) arose to embody it, tracing its forms and transcribing them into written characters—though without punctuation (句讀) to divide them.

As the text circulated through the ages and reached the Middle Antiquity, celestial spirits refined it into *Cloud Seal Script* (云篆) and *Tadpole Script* (蝌蚪), assembling it into coherent chapters. Later, the Divine Mother of Profound Truth (谌母) descended to orally transmit it to Patriarch Xu of Jingyang (旌阳许祖). Not only were the forms rendered with greater precision, but the sounds were also clarified in full.

The Patriarch wished to transcribe it into the standard script of the age but feared that the ignorant might introduce errors. Thus, he composed a four-character verse incorporating the meanings of the Elixir Way (丹道), ensuring no mistakes would arise—though this was not the original intent of the primordial scripture’s meaning. This four-character Jade Scripture, then, resembles Zhou Xingsi’s *Thousand-Character Classic* or the modern compilation of the *Lanting Calligraphy Model*: its essence lies in rhythm and structure.

In the past, I lamented the difficulty of comprehension and thus provided annotations, though they risked becoming empty verbal explanations. Fortunately, the phonetic readings mostly adhere to the original. However, for the characters *"namo"* (南無), I render them separately as *"nang mo"* (曩謨). For the character *"gou"* (垢) in *"bai fen tian gou"* (百奋天垢), I pronounce it as *"hou"* (后), with a distinct understanding that does not align with this oral tradition.

Upon reviewing the *Medical and Worldly Achievement Formulae* (医世功诀), I found no annotations, only preserved phonetic readings as recorded. It warns against commentary, stating that prolonged recitation will naturally lead to realization. The original transmission’s profound teachings (玄训) are of utmost subtlety—meant to be grasped intuitively, not conveyed through words.

In the Daoist tradition, it is said: *"Sincere recitation for one year makes one a human immortal; for two years, an earthly immortal; for three years, a celestial immortal. Even the least diligent, if they recite daily without interruption, may attain liberation through simulated death (尸解) and ascend the Way."* Could this be deception? The only danger lies in lapses in practice.

The power of the *Jade Sutra*—how could it be fathomed? Now, I record its proven efficacy as transmitted by my teacher, offering it to the world. I only wish that learners enter its gate through the pure cultivation of a tranquil and empty heart.

When regulated to the point where the chest is clear and still, the celestial realm attains perfect stability. When regulated to the point where the abdomen is open and at ease, the world’s households prosper. When regulated to the point where the four limbs flow freely, the four barbarian lands find peace. Thus, when the body is harmonized, the self is at peace; when the self is at peace, the world is governed. Its effects are swift as an echo—once the sutra is penetrated, it becomes the transformative power of the sage’s gate. This is no mere discourse on subtleties or mysteries, but a grounded and practical study of the Dao.

This is the supreme principle by which humanity stands as the third alongside heaven and earth. What doubt or fear could we harbor, that we would willingly abandon it? Yet, fearing that learners may not awaken, I have also compiled the proven formulae of past efficacy into an incantation, so that recitation may yield shared results. It is not like digging once to find a spring—if one person achieves tenfold, another a hundredfold, and another a thousandfold, even the dull-witted will surely attain clarity.

What follows is the incantation, not the sutra’s text. Yet the formulae are contained below—study them carefully and practice them, not merely reciting with the mouth.

**Incantation (Appended to the Sutra)**
*"I/We now recite..."*
This phrase directly follows the sutra’s text. The use of *I* (我) and *we* (吾) rather than *your servant* (臣) is not arbitrary. According to the *Canon of All Daoist Traditions*, the human body is a microcosm of heaven and earth. Just as heaven and earth have their spirits, so does the human body, and the spirit of the human body resonates with that of heaven and earth. The invocation of *I* and *we* here follows the esoteric conventions of ritualists, used to bind the Dipper’s stars—not employed casually.

By this mystical law: on yang days, recite *I* (我) and bind it to the Nine Stars of the Greedy Wolf Dipper; on yin days, recite *we* (吾) and bind it to the Nine Stars of the Great Dipper. The method involves tracing one star per stroke, and those who understand the intent will recite *I* on yang days and *we* on yin days—this, too, has its verifications.

The human heart has seven apertures, supported by the waist and kidneys, forming nine in the "lesser heart"—this proves the heart’s unity with the Dipper. The precept warns against self-deception: one must heed the luminous mandate, for the formulae’s truth lies solely in its absence of falsehood.

**Follow the teachings and practice accordingly.**
What follows is all derived from verified practice, yielding real effects. Learners must earnestly embody and enact them, not merely recite with the mouth.

**Guard the Three Powers as an egg.**
This means regarding heaven and earth as a chicken’s egg, with the human world as its yolk—what we guard. This phrase still resides within the state before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise.

**The world transforms into a court of fortune.**
Here, *world* encompasses both the self and the external realm. *Court* refers to the "court of the Jade Sutra’s gaze," where the egg-guarding practice’s effects manifest fully—heaven and earth yield their tangible results.

**Baneful stars retreat; auspicious radiance descends.**
These two lines echo *The Great Learning*: *"Fortune graces the house, virtue graces the body; the heart expands, the body is at ease—thus the noble person must make their intent sincere."*

**All heavens bestow blessings; wealth, rank, trust, and kinship flourish.**
These two lines embody the Dao of aligning one’s virtue with heaven and earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s order with the four seasons, and one’s fortune with spirits and deities—acting prior to heaven without transgression. *Wealth and rank* derive from Buddhist scriptures, signifying prosperity and honor. *Trust* establishes, *kinship* humbles—nurturing life while rectifying virtue.

**Observe heaven and grasp its constancy; renew the self to renew the people.**
*Observing heaven* means witnessing its ceaseless sincerity. *Grasping heaven* means holding to its singularity as the source of all things. *Renewing the self to renew the people* is the tangible effect of personal cultivation on the populace.

**Neither existence nor non-existence is established; both human and dharma are forgotten.**
**Perfect emptiness, perfect stillness; perfect uprightness, perfect strength; perfect harmony, perfect peace; perfect awakening, perfect purity.**
These six lines describe governance through non-action, encapsulating the true state of one’s being—just as the sutra’s text arises from the self and the world. Only those who constantly dwell in the "court of the gaze" abide at its center and awaken to this perfection. For beginners, attempting to grasp it with the intellect is delusion—no accomplishment will follow. Yet one must know, preserve, and uphold this to develop steadfast power, enabling efficacy and ensuring future results.

Thus, some disciples, fearing learners might mistake intellectual understanding for realization, requested these six lines be removed—but I refused. Let all understand: the first line is the essential formula for entering the nature of heaven; the second, the profound insight for advancing in spiritual practice; the remaining four, the esoteric teachings against attachment or partiality. True attainment encompasses the six directions, the entire dharma-realm, without bias—this is the meaning of heaven’s covering, earth’s bearing, the sun and moon’s illumination, frost and dew’s descent, and the radiance of the Dao’s *qi* pervading all, sentient and insentient. The practice guards against stagnation or leakage—these are all vital formulae. How could they be excised? Learners must fully embody and enact them, without negligence or omission.

**Together uphold the teachings, repaying the Four Graces.**
All the above pertains to what inherently resides within our nature. Heaven and earth have me; parents gave me life; rulers and teachers instructed me; the sun and moon illuminate me. This means possessing all that is needed to fulfill my duties—and more. Thus, I dare not take it lightly, recording and presenting these formulae to the utmost, wishing to jointly uphold the teachings and strive to repay the Four Graces.

**Perfect great awakening in the world; primal, prosperous, harmonious, and steadfast.**
Here, *world* refers to the individual. To perfect others, one must first perfect oneself. The work of self-perfection lies in *awakening*, and its achievements are encompassed by the four virtues: *primal, prosperous, harmonious, and steadfast*.

What follows is the incantation—its ritual prohibitions and annotations dare not be profaned.

Om, Jvalan (two syllables combined) Svāhā.
This incantation is the *One-Syllable Crown Wheel King Mantra* spoken by the Buddha’s Crown. Scholars who uphold it should recite it thrice while standing with three prostrations; practitioners need only maintain it in their own conduct.

I observe that the entire corpus of these formulae begins with the absence of a single thought. Proceeding thus, the mind becomes clear and the qi harmonized, attaining a state where the whole body is pervaded by harmony—whereby both this life and the world are benefited. The key lies in constancy.

Yet even a single moment of clarity and harmony yields a moment of true virtue. Though no effect may be immediately apparent, the effect is inherently present. Scholars must guard against the desire for hasty results, lest they fall into the karmic snares of consciousness. For the human mind is most numinous yet most demonic; once ensnared, perceptions become chaotic, and severance proves interminable—hence the need for vigilance.

Scholars should begin by quieting the mind and settling the qi, thereby allowing the true *Primordial Qi* to arise. This *Primordial Qi* emerges naturally when the breath is stilled; if the breath remains unsettled, the true *Primordial Qi* will not manifest. There is no other method—only the absence of a single thought allows the mind to attain stillness, whereupon the breath naturally ceases.

To mistakenly employ forced cessation is to pursue the opposite path, causing the breath to become labored instead. This must be avoided. The so-called "absence of a single thought" does not mean utter vacuity, but rather the exclusion of extraneous thoughts—it is the Dao of perfect sincerity without interruption.
