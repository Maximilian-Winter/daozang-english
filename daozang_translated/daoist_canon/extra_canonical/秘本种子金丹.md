**The Secret Manual of the Golden Elixir for Progeny**
*By Ye Tianshi of the Qing Dynasty*

**Volume One**

**General Discourse on Progeny**
The Dao of human life begins with the pursuit of offspring. The method of seeking progeny does not extend beyond two key principles: men cultivating essence and women nourishing blood. When yang essence overflows without exhaustion and yin blood descends in due time without fault, yin and yang harmonize, essence and blood coalesce, and the embryo forms, giving rise to life. If yang is deficient and cannot descend to meet yin, or yin is depleted and cannot ascend to receive yang, yin and yang oppose each other, essence and blood diverge, and thus there is no child.

The method of treatment: men should replenish their essence and moderate their desires to maintain the vigor of the yang path; women should nourish their blood and balance their qi to ensure menstruation occurs in its proper time. Through mutual cultivation, the Dao of having children is achieved.

Yet people fail to examine this, instead attributing success or failure to the five phases, seeking supplementation through food and medicine. They allow the artificial to overcome the natural, human effort to usurp heaven’s work—thus, though conception may occur, many children do not survive, or if they do, do not live long.

**Pulse Diagnosis for Progeny**
In seeking progeny, the pulse is chiefly assessed at the *chi* position. If the right *chi* is overly strong, fire stirs and lust prevails; if the left *chi* is overly strong, yin is deficient and misfortune follows. Only a deep, slippery, and even pulse is conducive to conception. A faint and rough pulse indicates thin essence; if accompanied by slowness, it signifies extreme cold. If the pulse is weak and timid, one lacks strength for intercourse. In women who struggle to conceive, the *chi* pulse is also rough.

**Methods for Selecting a Woman**
Those who seek progeny must first choose a woman, just as planting requires selecting the right soil. For how can one expect a bountiful harvest from rocky ground? And how can one hope for noble offspring from a woman of meager fortune? Thus, for the sake of descendants, one cannot neglect selection.

Generally, a woman’s constitution values stillness over restlessness, heaviness over lightness, thickness over thinness, and maturity over youthfulness. Therefore:
- Those with short lips and small mouths are unfit—this pertains to the region of progeny;
- Those with small, thin ears are unfit—this is an external sign of kidney qi;
- Those with weak, faint voices are unfit—this reflects the foundation of *dantian* qi;
- Those with frail bodies are unfit—this indicates a weak palace of storage;
- Those with delicate appetites are unfit—this suggests a deficient source of the blood sea and granary;
- Those with brittle hair and missing teeth are unfit—this signifies liver blood and kidney essence depletion;
- Those with protruding eyes and narrow hips are unfit—their organs fail to store, and they will have no descendants;
- Those with greenish hues at the bridge of the nose or around the mouth are unfit—yang cannot overcome yin, leading to stagnation and counterflow in the liver and spleen;
- Those with tight, rapid, wiry, or rough pulses are unfit—their true yin is weak, their menstrual cycles irregular, and their vital generative qi lacking.

Other considerations:
- Girls who have not yet reached maturity lack fully developed yin qi;
- Women with excessive desires tend to bear more daughters;
- Those with gentle temperaments find menstrual regulation easier;
- Those with jealous natures have irregular menses;
- Those with harsh appearances are heavy in form;
- Those with beautiful faces often have thin fortune;
- Those with flesh that overwhelms their bones have fat-clogged wombs;
- Those as thin as firewood have bloodless wombs.

Furthermore, women with tiger-like heads, bear-like necks, wasp-like eyes, jackal-like voices, or crosswise faces and vertical brows are prone to harming their children. Those who are fierce, treacherous, or cruel are equally unfavorable for progeny. Those seeking descendants must urgently attend to these matters.

**The Sole Responsibility of Men for Progeny**
The responsibility for having or lacking offspring lies entirely with men; yet世俗俗见 often place the burden solely on women—this is an ignorant view.

The *Book of Changes* states: *"The way of Kun is to follow heaven and act in its time."* The generation of life by Kun is nothing more than following heaven; thus, a mother’s bearing of children is merely following the father. How can women be considered the primary factor?

If women were the primary factor, consider the households of the wealthy, where concubines abound—among them, are there not those whose menses arrive on time and who are free of illness? Some take women who have borne children frequently with previous husbands, hoping for ease, yet they still fail to conceive. But when these same women are given to others, they promptly bear children. How can they fail to conceive with one man yet succeed with another? Thus, the presence or absence of offspring rests solely with men.

Regardless of age or strength, men must have abundant spirit, which depends entirely on moderating desire. By moderating desire, they avoid reckless intercourse, accumulate qi, store essence, and act at the proper time—thus, conception is achieved in one attempt.

Yet世俗俗见 attribute miscarriages solely to the mother, childlessness to the child, and longevity or early death to fate—is this not absurd?

Generally, children born to young men are often weak due to frequent desire and thin essence; children born to older men are often robust because their desires are few and their essence complete.

During intercourse, one must not engage in vigorous thrusting; gentle, subtle movements suffice. If one thrusts vigorously, the fetus will inevitably suffer from wind. Thus, children born to older men are often free of wind because they cannot engage in vigorous thrusting.

After conception, one must absolutely avoid further intercourse—first, to prevent hidden miscarriage, and second, to avoid the child being afflicted by fetal toxins.

Thus, men must first cultivate themselves before attending to women—only then can success be achieved.

**Cultivating Essence as the Foundation of Progeny**
The method of seeking progeny requires men to first cultivate essence and women to first nourish blood. Yet those who lack children often indulge excessively in lust. How can they not know that unrestrained ejaculation thins yang essence, and indulging desire injures true qi? How can they hope for conception through reckless desire?

Men govern emission, women govern reception; through one emission and one reception, conception is achieved. Yet what is emitted today is not the thick, primordial qi of the pre-heaven, but merely the dregs of the post-heaven. Even if yin can transform what is received, it lacks the function of yang’s emission.

Thus, those seeking progeny must not harm themselves through excessive thought, nor deplete their heart and spirit. They must not let their intent wander outward, leaving the interior hollow, nor let their will be damaged within, rendering the exterior weak. They must not use wine as an aphrodisiac, nor rely on drugs to stoke the fire. By calming the heart and reducing desire, settling the spirit and treasuring essence, and cultivating stillness over time, qi becomes abundant and spirit complete. Acting in accord with the proper time, that single drop of pre-heaven’s true essence—vital qi—will surge forth with the flaccidity of yang, and success will be certain in every attempt.

The *Inner Canon* states: "When yin is balanced and yang is secure, spirit and essence are well-ordered; when yin and yang part and separate, essence and qi are cut off." Laozi said: "Be clear, be still, and do not disturb your essence." The *Mirror of Man* says: "When essence and qi are abundant, two sons are born." These all refer to this principle.

**Nurturing Essence Requires Reducing Desire**
The methods of seeking progeny have been discussed extensively by the ancients. The *Broad Principles of Progeny* advises that when the menstrual period has just ceased and the womb is open, one should timely sow the seed. The *Daoist Canon* holds that after the cessation of menstruation, conception on odd days pertains to yang and results in a male, while on even days it pertains to yin and results in a female. Li Dongyuan believed that conception one or two days after menstruation results in a male, while four or five days after results in a female. Zhu Danxi taught that receiving qi in the left womb produces a male, while in the right womb produces a female. The *Sacred Aid Canon* states that movement on the left results in a male, while on the right results in a female. The *Master Chu’s Posthumous Writings* asserts that blood enveloping essence forms a male, while essence enveloping blood forms a female. Though these theories abound and each has its merits, none achieves perfect efficacy. The method that yields complete success is none other than reducing desire. With reduced desire, one does not engage in reckless union but gathers essence and spirit, acting in accord with the proper time—what could one not attain?

Yet reducing desire must begin with calming the heart. The heart governs blood and stores spirit; when the heart is stirred, the spirit scatters outward. Though no emission occurs externally, essence has already departed its palace, and kidney qi follows, becoming internally disordered. In mild cases, this leads to nocturnal emissions or turbid urine; in severe cases, it results in syphilis or toxic swellings. Even if one is fortunate enough to avoid these, during intercourse there will be no true qi of stillness and unity, and what is emitted will be nothing but putrid filth—how can it transform and nurture a fetus?

The heart is the master of the body. If one can sweep away wayward thoughts and cultivate stillness, preventing the fire from stirring, then when yang essence is full and the time is right, conception will be achieved in a single act. Thus, reducing desire preserves the spirit, and not only does it lead to many children, but also to longevity.

**Nurturing Essence Requires Moderating Labor**
Essence is formed from blood, and it is not only sexual labor that depletes one’s essence—many daily activities also cause harm. When the eyes are strained by sight, blood is consumed by seeing; when the ears are strained by hearing, blood is consumed by listening; when the heart is strained by thought, blood is consumed by thinking. If one moderates these at all times, blood will be nourished and accumulate day by day.

**Nurturing Essence Requires Curbing Anger**
The kidneys govern storage, and the liver governs dispersion; both organs contain ministerial fire, and their systems are connected above to the heart. The heart is the sovereign fire. Anger injures the liver and stirs the ministerial fire, causing the dispersing function to dominate while the storing function fails in its duty. Even without intercourse, essence is silently and subtly depleted.

**Nurturing Essence Requires Abstaining from Alcohol**
Among foods and drinks, each has its suitability for the organs, and one need not be overly restrictive—except in the case of alcohol. The qi of pre-heaven that forms the fetal seed must be utterly clear and fully substantial, yet the nature of alcohol is lewd and heating. It not only disturbs the mind but also disrupts essence. When essence is disturbed by alcohol, half becomes damp-heat, and only half remains true essence. If essence is not substantial, the fetal origin is unstable; if essence is laden with damp-heat, future ailments such as pox, convulsions, or spleen failure will likely have their roots here. Thus, those seeking progeny must strictly abstain from alcohol. If one must drink, better to drink less than more; and better still not to drink at all—this is the great mechanism of the fetal origin. If one enters the bedchamber while drunk, essence will be agitated and thin.

**Nurturing Essence Requires Care in Diet**
The *Inner Canon* states: "When essence is insufficient, supplement it with flavor." Yet rich and heavy flavors cannot generate essence; only bland and light flavors can truly nourish it. All things possess their true flavor, but excessive seasoning obscures it. Whether meat or vegetables, when prepared properly, they naturally possess a harmonious and tranquil qi, and consuming them will naturally nurture essence. Among foods, the five grains alone embody the proper balance of the five flavors. Thus, when congee or rice is fully cooked, the thick liquid that forms on the surface is the concentrated essence of the grain. Consuming it quickly replenishes essence—this has been proven effective.

Those who practice these several methods will find them not only an excellent way to seek progeny but also a wondrous art for preserving life.

**The Method of Refining Essence**
Refining essence begins with the kidneys. The inner kidney has an aperture called the *Guanyuan*, and the outer kidney has an aperture called the *Pinhu*. Before true essence is emitted and the qian body is broken, the yang qi of the outer kidney rises at the *zi* hour. The qi of the human body corresponds to the qi of heaven and earth. Once essence is emitted and the body is broken, the onset of yang in the body gradually delays—sometimes to the *chou* hour, sometimes to the *yin*, or even to the *mao* hour before it arises. In some cases, it never arises at all, and thus the body no longer corresponds to heaven and earth.

The secret to refining essence lies in rising at midnight during the *zi* hour, donning clothes, and sitting upright. Rub both hands until extremely hot, then use one hand to cup the outer kidney while the other presses the navel, focusing the spirit on the inner kidney. Practicing this over time will cause essence to flourish.

**The Sovereign and Ministerial Fires Must Be Understood**

The hundred fires reside in the heart, and the heart is their sovereign; the ministerial fire resides in the kidney, and the kidney is their root. Yet the two fires are mutually dependent, responding without sound. Thus, the heart should be still—if not, fire stirs from desire and moves from the heart to provoke the kidney. Those who prioritize the heart over the kidney scorch yin with yang through force, and force causes qi to descend, losing hold of the cinnabar field and forfeiting the great foundation of primordial yang. The kidney should be replete, for when the kidney is full, yang rises from the earth and ascends from kidney to heart. Those who prioritize the kidney before the heart nurture fire with fire in accordance with nature, and nature allows qi to rise so that the hundred vessels arrive in unison—this is the true mechanism of transformation and nurturance. Thus, frivolous men often resort to force and frequently suffer depletion and taxation, harming their descendants; steadfast and sincere gentlemen naturally follow the Way, so all things flourish—why worry for their posterity? Those seeking offspring must also grasp the true mechanism of the yang path.

**The Arising of Passion Between Man and Woman**
When man and woman are harmonious and joyful, and passion arises in both before union, yang bestows and yin receives, forming an embryo and thus bearing a child. If the man’s passion has arisen but the woman’s heart remains unmoved, their jade bodies may join, yet the jade nectar flows prematurely—yang essence is bestowed, but yin does not receive it. If the woman’s passion has arisen but the man’s intent wavers, the peach waves surge in vain, and the jade dew does not drip—yin blood opens, but yang has nothing to enter. When yin and yang are discordant, they become the *pi* of heaven and earth not joining; how then can the ten thousand things be born?

**On the Timing of Conception**
Heaven and earth generate beings only at a certain time; the ten thousand things transform and give life only at a season of nurturance. Even the lowly cat and dog, when about to conceive, will have the female run and leap wildly, for the qi of nurturance stirs them so they cannot restrain themselves. This is the seasonal node of heaven and earth, the true mechanism of transformation and life. After a woman’s menstruation ends, there will be a day when a lotus pistil emerges from within the palace of the child, steam rising and heat surging, spirit clouded and stifled, with an irresistible urge for union—this is the moment for receiving essence and forming an embryo. If one acts against it, elixir is formed; if one follows it, an embryo is conceived. Yet women often conceal this out of shame, so the man must inform her in advance and have her speak of it herself—then one attempt will succeed.

**The Wondrous Secret of Advancing Fire**
The jade lake should be lightly traversed—shallow crossing delights the woman, while heavy burden brings her harm. Yin blood gathers first, and yang essence flows afterward. When the red flower embraces the jade dew, one strides to the immortal isles. *(When blood envelops essence, a son is born; ascending directly forms an embryo.)*

**The Three Arrivals of the Man**

Before union, a man exhibits three arrivals: when the yang path is vigorous and erect, this is the arrival of liver qi; when it is robust and hot, this is the arrival of heart qi; when it is firm, strong, and enduring, this is the arrival of kidney qi. When all three arrivals are complete, they delight the woman’s heart. If it is flaccid and fails to rise, liver qi has not arrived—forced union at this time injures the sinews, and his essence will drip without ejaculation. If it is robust but not hot, heart qi has not arrived—forced union injures the blood, and his essence will be thin and cold. If it is firm but not enduring, kidney qi has not arrived—forced union injures the bones, and his essence will not emerge, or if it does, will be scant. Those seeking offspring must value moderation of desire and clarity of mind to nurture the qi of liver, heart, and kidney.

Before union, a woman exhibits five arrivals: when her face flushes red and her brows crease, this is the arrival of heart qi; when her eyes grow moist and she casts sidelong glances, this is the arrival of liver qi; when she lowers her head in silence and her nose runs, this is the arrival of lung qi; when she nestles close and her body stirs of its own accord, this is the arrival of spleen qi; when the jade gate opens and jade nectar flows, this is the arrival of kidney qi. When all five qi arrive, the man may then unite with her, employing the method of nine shallow and one deep thrusts—thus their passion harmonizes, their intent is fulfilled, and conception is assured.

During union, a woman suffers five injuries: first, if the yin gate remains closed and unopened, it must not be forcibly pierced—forced piercing injures the liver; second, if the woman’s arousal has stirred but the man does not comply, and union occurs only after her ardor has passed, this injures the heart and disrupts menstruation; third, if a young yin encounters an aged yang, and the jade stem is not firm but easily softens, the woman’s desire will not flow freely—this injures the liver and may lead to blindness; fourth, if menstrual blood has not fully ceased and the man forces union, this injures the kidneys; fifth, if the man, drunk, engages in battle with a jade stem hard and unyielding, thrusting relentlessly even after the woman’s passion has waned and his yang ardor persists, this injures the spleen. With these five injuries, how can there be a child?

Five Signs in Women

Soft moans and whispered words—this is the heart; closed eyes that do not open—this is the liver; parched throat and labored breath—this is the lungs; legs now bent, now stretched, lying supine as if a corpse—this is the spleen; cold breath from mouth and nose, with slippery fluid seeping from the jade gate—this is the kidneys. When these five signs reach the height of bliss, if the man recognizes her state and gathers her essence, not only will there be a child, but also the benefit of mutual nourishment.

**Differing Paces in Yin and Yang**
The nature of yin and yang, their essence and disposition, are not uniform: those whose essence is firm tend to be slow, while those whose essence is unsteady tend to be swift. The slow, if hurried, are like the hungry awaiting food, yet unable to swallow when it arrives; the swift, if delayed, are like the drunk offered another cup, longing to vomit but unable. When swift and slow do not match, how can conception occur? Thus, when slow meets swift, one should take an unexpected path, avoiding a premature display; when swift meets slow, one should remain composed, provoking before engaging—then the encounter will be perfectly timed.

**Disparities in Strength**
When yang is strong and yin weak, she may fear it like a wasp’s sting or avoid it like a spear’s thrust; when yang is weak and yin strong, she may yield at the mere rustle of wind or flee at the sight of dust. If strength and weakness clash without balance, how can conception take place? Yet to support the weak, one must act with benevolence and righteousness, ensuring her heart is won. To overcome the strong is difficult—without gathering essence and spirit, how can one seize her soul? Truly, with this method, the strong need not be feared, nor the weak a concern.

**Childlessness in the Young**
A bud just opening, its vital qi not yet unfurled; a girl just reaching maidenhood, her heavenly water not yet abundant. Have you ever seen an unripe grain become seed, or an undersized silkworm spin a cocoon? To force the matter is to waste effort—even if one persists for now, can the aged wait? This is merely squandering the proper time.

**Avoidances in Union**
In the union of man and woman, ancient methods dictate avoiding the days of bing and ding, the crescent and waning moons, and the new and full moons. Yet for those struggling to conceive, such restrictions may be overlooked. However, during great winds, heavy rains, thunderstorms, dense fogs, bitter cold, scorching heat, or when heaven and earth are dark and murky—during eclipses, rainbows, or earthquakes—these are times of heaven and earth’s wrath, when the qi of the four seasons is unbalanced. To couple then harms the man a hundredfold, sickens the woman, and even if a child is conceived, it will surely be afflicted with epilepsy, stupidity, muteness, deafness, paralysis, blindness, chronic illness, short life, or a lack of filial piety and benevolence. This is the first set of avoidances.

Moreover, one must not couple beneath the light of the sun, moon, or stars; within temples or Buddhist monasteries; beside wells, stoves, latrines, or privies; near tombs, doorways, or thresholds; or in dark, perilous places. This is the second set of avoidances. If one knows to avoid these times and places, then spirits of fortune, virtue, great wisdom, and goodness will descend to dwell in the womb, bestowing a child of harmonious nature, whose family will prosper daily. Not only will they be free of illness, but they will also be intelligent, handsome, and long-lived. If one does not avoid these taboos, then foolish, deceitful, and wicked spirits will enter the womb, resulting in a child of violent and treacherous nature, whose family will decline daily. Not only will they suffer disabilities, but they will also face sudden calamities. The correspondence of fortune and misfortune from heaven is as swift as an echo—how can one not be cautious?

**Guarding Against Silent Miscarriage**
When the embryo first forms, its shape is like a dewdrop—its vessel unsupported, its root without ground. If steadied, it will take hold; if disturbed, it will flow away. Thus, after conception, one must strictly moderate desire to prevent overflow. Yet the young, indulging their passions without restraint or fear, often rely on their strength and do not falter—or, having faltered, resume the battle. At such times, the host (the woman) seeks stillness, but the guest (the man) refuses to cease. What can be done with such a reckless intruder, pounding at the door? With her watery nature and ardent disposition, how can she not open the gate and follow the current away? At that moment, fallen blossoms fly with butterflies, fire-dates and intertwined pears scatter together—mingling in filth and flowing away. Unaware, yesterday’s conception becomes today’s miscarriage, the new moon’s conception becomes the full moon’s loss. Conceived and lost in secret, with no trace left behind.

For a visible miscarriage, the fetus has already taken shape, and the loss is felt; but a silent miscarriage is like water slipping away—how can one know? Thus, many households have no full-term births because of frequent silent miscarriages. Those who marry courtesans often have no children, for their wombs are slippery and accustomed to such losses.

I have often seen those who struggle to conceive: when asked about their yang affairs, they say they are accustomed to battle; when asked about their skill, they claim mastery; when asked about their situation, they sigh and lament, *"Everyone has children—why do I alone have none?"* How would they know that others have visible births while theirs are silent losses?

Additionally, some women miscarry at three, five, or seven months—though this is more common among the weak, it is often caused by unrestrained desire, injuring the mother’s qi and leading to miscarriage. Thus, those who rely on brute strength often have no children, for strength and weakness destroy each other; those who indulge without restraint often fail to bear offspring, for they plunder the embryo’s vital qi. How can this all be blamed on the woman? Those seeking descendants should anticipate these dangers and guard against them—then, perhaps, success may follow.

**The Method of Keeping Concubines**
To take a concubine without cause is far from virtuous—all manner of ruin stems from this. Yet if one is aged, the wife is barren, and there is no heir, then circumstances may leave no choice. However, acquiring a concubine is easy; keeping her is difficult—and keeping her requires proper method.

First, one must not be overly strict. When the wife sees the concubine, she is hardly pleased. Thus, she may often scold, curse, or find fault with her conduct, or use harsh words and stern expressions—these are the inevitable reactions of human nature.

Yet they fail to understand that childbirth depends on qi and blood, and qi and blood depend on the state of the mind. When the mind is not at ease, the Chong and Ren meridians are injured; when the Chong and Ren meridians are injured, the womb cannot conceive. Thus, one must not be overly strict in keeping a concubine.

Second, the concubine’s quarters should be quiet, secluded, and removed from frequent observation. For in the moment of private union, the man should be vigorous, and the woman receptive—both vigor and receptivity arise from qi. At such a time, if the mind is focused, qi gathers and advances directly, thus favoring conception. If timid, qi falters and fails to be retained—how then can a fetus form? Yet the root of courage or timidity lies in the heart; where the heart goes, qi follows. If the heart harbors doubt or fear, it does not fully engage, and qi does not arrive. Should one be startled by some sound at the critical moment, qi lingers in the ears and does not reach the generative organs; if distracted by some sight, qi remains in the eyes and does not reach them. Or if anger or dread arises, qi becomes knotted in the heart and fails to arrive. When qi does not arrive, it is like casting a stone into water—the water remains unmoved.

Moreover, when two forces engage in battle, nothing is more harmful than spies lurking to observe; with a single, undivided mind, how can one endure slander and estrangement? This is why the concubine’s quarters must be quiet and secluded.

Yet these two methods are but makeshift measures for those with no better recourse. If one is blessed with a wise and virtuous wife who thinks only of continuing the ancestral line, harboring no jealousy and even showing compassion, then the closer the concubine, the greater the comfort—and how can seclusion be humane? If not, then though one may keep a concubine in name, in truth one does not, and what benefit is there in having her?

**Caution in Medicines and Diet for Progeny**
There is no fixed formula for begetting offspring, for remedies must be tailored to the individual. The cold-natured require warming, the hot-natured cooling; the slippery require astringency, the deficient require tonification. Correcting imbalances harmonizes yin and yang, and life flourishes—this is the wondrous method of begetting children. Yet people today, ignorant of this principle, merely pass down formulas, assuming what suits one will suit all. Or seeing one person succeed by chance, they blindly follow, heedless of their own needs, and recklessly prepare and consume such medicines—as if a hat made for Zhang could fit Li.

Moreover, most formulas for begetting offspring rely heavily on substances that invigorate yang and generate heat, even to the point of refining minerals and metals or concocting toxic, foul, or harsh ingredients. These are flaunted as marvels, enhancing bedroom pleasure while disregarding the harm to the body—those seeking descendants should beware.

**Causes of Male Infertility**
The illnesses that hinder conception relate to essence in men and blood in women, both stemming from insufficiency. In men, insufficiency manifests as seminal weakness: essence may be slippery, thin, or cold; one may lack firmness at the crucial moment, or ejaculate without force; one may suffer from frequent nocturnal emissions, turbid urine, or painful strangury. Or one may indulge excessively in women, leading to yin deficiency, which causes lumbar and renal pain and fatigue. Or one may indulge in male-male relations, leading to extreme yang, which exhausts yin. Or one may be overly forceful, disrupting harmony in the act. Or one may suffer from chronic genital swelling, which disrupts the liver and kidneys. Additionally, some men are afflicted with yang deficiency, which causes coldness, or yin deficiency, which causes heat. These are all male disorders and cannot be blamed entirely on women. If the root cause is identified and treated, success will follow.

**Causes of Female Infertility**
For women, blood is paramount, for blood unites with essence to form a fetus. To diagnose infertility, observe the condition after menstruation; to treat it, regulate the yin aspect. Menstruation is blood, and blood is yin, which corresponds to the moon—thus, monthly cycles are normal. When illness arises, however, menstruation may come early or late, twice in a month, or once every two months; it may cease entirely or flow incessantly. There may be pain before or after bleeding; the color may be pale, purple, or black; the flow may be clotted and formless, or scanty due to insufficient essence and blood, turning into leukorrhea. There may be collapse of original qi, leading to flooding and spotting; or deficiency-cold in the uterus, preventing yang qi from generating life; or hidden heat in the blood, preventing yin qi from congealing. There may be blood stasis or qi masses, uterine prolapse, or amenorrhea—all are disorders of true yin.

The methods of treatment are detailed in the two volumes on regulating menstruation. When true yin is diseased, insufficient yin blood cannot nurture a fetus, and insufficient yin qi cannot retain it. The power of retention and nurturance lies in the Gate of Life, for it is the sea of blood for the Chong and Ren meridians, and the fetus is governed by blood. Yet blood does not generate itself but depends on qi—thus, true yin is paramount. Therefore, tonifying the Gate of Life, whether with qi or blood, can be called tonifying yin. The method of tonifying yin is the way of strengthening the root and securing the foundation.

From youth to old age, this is indispensable for all, and all the more so as the foundation of both prenatal and postnatal life—without it, one cannot exert one’s strength. Thus, the methods of regulating menstruation and begetting offspring focus on replenishing the Gate of Life and preserving yang qi.

Yet the storehouse of essence and blood lies in the Gate of Life, while their source resides between the two yang organs, the heart and spleen. The heart governs blood—nourishing the heart nourishes blood; the spleen and stomach govern food and drink—fortifying them ensures the distribution of qi. When both are harmonized, qi flows and blood circulates. Thus, regulating emotions and diet should precede the regulation of menstruation—all are means of replenishing the source of yin.

Should one proceed with treatment without understanding the root and branch, the sequence of priority, how could one speak of methods for regulating menstruation and begetting offspring?

**Discerning Misguided Treatment in Begetting Offspring**
When yang essence is emitted, yin blood can secure it; essence forms the child, blood forms the womb, and thus conception is achieved. Now, when women are childless, it is invariably due to insufficient blood failing to secure essence. Blood deficiency arises from many causes, yet only by regulating and supplementing yin blood to ensure no depletion can conception occur. Common physicians, failing to examine closely, uniformly attribute it to deficiency-cold in the uterus, administering acrid and hot medicinals that sear the viscera, causing blood and qi to surge and boil. Menstruation then turns dark purple or black, gradually diminishing in volume. Initially, appetite may surge, but over time, the mouth becomes bitter and dry, and a host of disorders arises—how then can conception occur? Even if a child is born, it is seldom long-lived.

**Male Yin Deficiency and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
When a man’s true yin is insufficient, it cannot nourish the constructive and defensive qi, gradually giving rise to debility. This may manifest as intermittent fevers, spontaneous sweating, or night sweats; as the spirit failing to guard its abode and blood failing to return to its origin; as depletion damaging yin; as seminal loss or dribbling urinary incontinence; as qi deficiency leading to dizziness; as blurred vision or deafness; as dry mouth and parched tongue; or as aching lumbus and weak legs. For all conditions involving internal depletion of essence and marrow or desiccation of fluids, one must swiftly supplement the true yin of the left kidney. The *Zuogui Pill* is indicated:

**Zuogui Pill**
*Shudihuang* (prepared rehmannia root), 8 *liang*, pounded into paste
*Shanyao* (Chinese yam), stir-fried with ginger juice
*Gouqizi* (goji berry)
*Shanzhuyu* (cornelian cherry), kernels removed
*Lujiao jiao* (deerhorn glue), stir-fried to pearls
*Guijiao* (tortoise plastron glue), stir-fried to pearls
*Tusizi* (Chinese dodder seeds), prepared, each 4 *liang*
*Chuan niuxi* (Sichuan achyranthes root), wine-steamed, 3 *liang*

Grind the above into powder, form into honey pills the size of *tongzi* seeds, and take one hundred pills before meals with a mild salt solution.

If true yin is unsecured and deficiency fire flames upward, use purely yin and supremely tranquil ingredients: remove *gouqizi* and *lujiao jiao*, and add *nüzhenzi* (glossy privet fruit) and *maidong* (dwarf lilyturf root), each 3 *liang*. If fire scorches the Metal phase (lung) causing dryness and frequent coughing, add *baihe* (lily bulb), 3 *liang*.

**Male Essence Deficiency and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
When essence is scant, though it may be emitted, it is invariably weak and thin.

For the cervix of the womb is widely open, and the scant essence that enters—how could it suffice to fill it? Of necessity, it must enter and exit in the same instant. The **Firming the Root Pill** is indicated.

**Yang Impotence and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
When an older man lacks offspring due to yang impotence and essence depletion, unable to engage in vigorous intercourse to arouse the woman’s passion—whether his ardor wanes at the crucial moment or his weapon falters mid-battle—the woman’s spring heart burns bright, while the man’s sighs arise in vain. How then can jade seeds be sown in the blue fields?

**Zan Yu Elixir Recommended.**

**Yang Deficiency and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
When a man’s primordial yang is insufficient—whether due to congenital weakness or excessive taxation—this leads to debilitation of the *mingmen* fire, which fails to generate earth, resulting in spleen-stomach vacuity cold. Manifestations may include:
reduced food intake, or nausea, distension, and vomiting;
regurgitation or dysphagia;
aversion to cold or abdominal pain;
loose stools or frequent diarrhea;
involuntary urination, vacuity strangury, or cold mounting;
cold invading the channels, causing limb and joint impediment pain;
or cold in the lower burner, leading to water qi and edema.
In sum, those with true yang insufficiency invariably exhibit:
spiritual fatigue and qi timidity;
palpitations or restlessness;
flaccid limbs;
hallucinations of malevolent spirits;
or yang debility and childlessness.
In such cases, hasten to fortify the primordial yang of the right kidney. **Right-Restoring Pill** is indicated.

**Right-Restoring Pill:**
Prepared *rehmannia* (mashed into paste) – 8 *liang*
*Shanyao* (Chinese yam), ginger juice-fried – 4 *liang*
*Gouqizi* (goji berry), lightly fried – 4 *liang*
*Lujiaojiao* (deer antler glue), fried into pearls – 4 *liang*

For unremitting abdominal pain, add 2 *liang* of *wuzhuyu* (evodia), soaked in decoction and fried.
For aching lumbus and knees, add 4 *liang* of *hutao* (walnut) meat with skin.
For yin vacuity with yang impotence, add 4 *liang* of *bajitou* (morinda root) and 3 *liang* of *roucongrong* (cistanche), wine-soaked. Alternatively, add one pair of yellow dog’s external kidneys, stewed in wine until soft and mashed in.

**Fire Exuberance and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
In cases of fire exuberance, ministerial fire is excessively effulgent.

Excessive prolonged intercourse results in the woman’s passion having passed while the man’s essence has yet to be released; by the time the man’s essence is released, the woman’s arousal has already waned—how then can conception occur? The *Buyin Pill* is indicated.

**Buyin Pill**
*Huangbai* (phellodendron), stir-fried with salted wine; *zhimu* (anemarrhena), stir-fried with salted wine—4 *liang* each
*Shudihuang* (steamed rehmannia), pounded; *guiban* (tortoise plastron), stir-fried with suet—6 *liang* each
Grind into powder, mix with steamed pig spinal marrow, and form into honeyed pills the size of *wuzi* seeds. Take 50–60 pills on an empty stomach with bland salt water.

**Male Fire Exuberance and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
When ministerial fire in men blazes excessively, it scorches true yin, leading to extreme yang; extreme yang then becomes hyperactive. Alternatively, if one is overly forceful in intercourse, such forcefulness disrupts harmony between dominance and submission, thus preventing conception. The *Yannian Yisi Dan* is indicated.

**Yannian Yisi Dan**
*Renshen* (ginseng)—3 *liang*
*Tiandong* (asparagus root), wine-soaked and heart removed—3 *liang*
*Maidong* (ophiopogon), wine-soaked and heart removed—3 *liang*
*Shudihuang* (steamed rehmannia), pounded; *shengdihuang* (raw rehmannia)—2 *liang* each
*Fuling* (poria), wine-soaked and sun-dried—5 *liang*
*Digupi* (lycium bark), wine-soaked—5 *liang*
Add *heshouwu* (fleeceflower root), half a *jin*: soak thoroughly in rice wine, pare off the skin with a bamboo knife, slice, and place in a wok. Add a slice of black sheep meat and 3 *ge* of black soybeans, with enough water to cover. Line a steamer with a bamboo mat, arrange the *heshouwu* on top, seal tightly to prevent steam from escaping, and steam for one to two hours until the meat is tender. Remove, sun-dry, grind into powder, and form into honeyed pills the size of *wuzi* seeds. Take 70–80 pills on an empty stomach with warm wine.

**Male "Chicken Essence" and Difficulty in Begetting Offspring**
In some men, the foreskin of the jade stem is so tender that the slightest touch induces unbearable itching. Thus, with each act of intercourse, yang essence is already discharged before yin essence flows—this is called "chicken essence." The *Zhuangyang Decoction* is indicated.

**Zhuangyang Decoction**
*Shechuangzi* (cnidium seed) and *digupi* (lycium bark) in equal parts
Decoct and use the liquid to steam and wash the affected area, rubbing gently with the hands. During washing, ensure the jade stem is erect for optimal effect. If the skin is rubbed raw, do not be alarmed—it will recover in a day or two. Steam and wash several times daily. The aim is to toughen the skin for greater endurance.

**Female Vacuity Weakness and Infertility**
When a woman’s qi and blood are both vacuous, her menstrual flow is irregular—sometimes ceasing, sometimes accompanied by vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, lumbar soreness, poor appetite, emaciation, and infertility. The *Yulinzhu* is indicated; taking one or two doses may enable conception. Among all formulas for promoting fertility, none surpass this.

**Yulinzhu**
*Renshen* (ginseng); *baizhu* (atractylodes), honey-fried; *baishao* (peony), wine-fried—2 *liang* each
*Chuanxiong* (ligusticum); *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice)—1 *liang* each
*Danggui* (tangkuei); *shudihuang* (steamed rehmannia)—4 *liang* each
*Tusizi* (cuscuta), prepared—4 *liang*
*Duzhong* (eucommia), wine-fried; *lujiaoshuang* (deer antler gelatin); *chuanjiao* (zanthoxylum), with seeds removed—2 *liang* each
Grind into powder and form into honeyed pills the size of bullets. Chew and take 1–2 pills on an empty stomach with plain boiled water, or form into smaller pills for swallowing.
- For delayed menstruation with abdominal pain, add *buguzhi* (psoralea), wine-fried, and *rougui* (cinnamon)—1 *liang* each; in severe cases, add *wuzhuyu* (evodia), soaked and fried—5 *qian*.
- For profuse vaginal discharge with abdominal pain, add *buguzhi* (psoralea), wine-fried—1 *liang*, and *beiwuwei* (schisandra)—5 *qian*; or add *longgu* (dragon bone), calcined with vinegar—1 *liang*.
- For severe cold in the uterus with diarrhea or pain, add *fuzi* (aconite), prepared, and *ganjiang* (dried ginger), blast-fried—several *qian* each.
- For depression, qi stagnation causing distension or fullness, add *xiangfu* (cyperus), wine-prepared—2 *liang*; in severe cases, add *chenxiang* (aloeswood)—5 *qian*.
- For blood heat with excessive fire, early menstruation, or internal heat, add *chuanxuduan* (dipsacus) and *digupi* (lycium bark)—2 *qian* each; or temporarily clear fire with a decoction before taking this formula, or use the decoction as a guiding agent.

**Female Viscus Cold and Infertility**
When a woman’s five viscera are vacuous and debilitated, the uterus becomes cold and enervated, leading to red and white vaginal discharge, night sweats, shortness of breath, aversion to cold, and cold intolerance. The *Xusici Jiangsheng Dan* is indicated. This formula contains no bizarre or harsh ingredients; it is both warming and astringent. For those with vacuity cold in the blood sea, it is highly effective. However, its warming power is ample while its supplementing power is insufficient. If augmented with *renshen* (ginseng), *baizhu* (atractylodes), *shudihuang* (steamed rehmannia), *chuanxiong* (ligusticum), and *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice)—1 *liang* each—its warming and supplementing effects in promoting fertility would be greatly enhanced. Thus, it is named the *Jiawei Xusici Jiangsheng Dan*.

**Xusici Jiangsheng Dan**
*Danggui* (tangkuei), wine-washed; *duzhong* (eucommia), wine-washed; *fushen* (poria spirit); *yizhiren* (alpinia); *longgu* (dragon bone), calcined; *guixin* (cinnamon bark); *wuzhuyu* (evodia), soaked in decoction; *ganjiang* (dried ginger), half raw and half cooked; *chuanjiao* (zanthoxylum), with seeds removed; *wuyao* (lindera), fried—1 *liang* each
*Baishao* (peony), wine-fried; *chuanniuxi* (cyathula), wine-soaked; *zhibanxia* (processed pinellia); *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia); *qinjiao* (gentiana); *shichangpu* (acorus), with hairs removed; *beixixin* (asarum); *jiegeng* (platycodon)—5 *qian* each
*Cinnabar*—1 *qian*: take one large *fuzi* (aconite), hollow out the base, fill with cinnabar, wrap and bake until cooked. Remove the cinnabar, discard the *fuzi*, grind the cinnabar into fine powder, and refine with water.
*Muli* (oyster shell)—select large pieces, soak in boy’s urine for 49 days, changing the urine every 5 days. Remove, coat thoroughly with 1 *liang* of *liuhuang* (sulfur) powder mixed with wine, wrap tightly with paper, moisten with rice vinegar, and seal with salt clay. Dry, then calcine with 5 *jin* of charcoal. Use 2 *liang* per dose; the remainder may be stored for future use.
Grind all ingredients into powder, form into pills with glutinous rice paste cooked in wine, the size of *wuzi* seeds, and coat with cinnabar. Take 30 pills, gradually increasing to 80–90 pills, on an empty stomach with plain boiled water.

**Female Obesity and Infertility**
Those with exuberant phlegm-qi tend to be obese; obesity causes the lower body to become overly plump, drawing the uterus inward and making conception difficult. Even if the man’s jade stem is long and vigorous, thrusting forcefully with essence shooting straight in, dampness from the bladder may cause overflow and flooding.

For cases of obesity with exuberant phlegm-qi, administer **Ditan Decoction** to accompany **Ditan Pills**.

**Ditan Decoction**
*Danggui* (washed in wine), *Baizhu* (honey-fried), *Baishao*, *Banxia* (processed), *Xiangfu* (rice-prepared), *Chenpi*, and *Gancao* – 2 *liang* each; *Fuling* – 4 *liang*; *Chuanxiong* – 7 *qian* and 5 *fen*.
Divide into ten doses. Decoct with three slices of ginger and use to swallow **Ditan Pills**.

**Ditan Pills**
*Baizhu* (honey-fried) – 2 *liang*; *Banxia* (fermented), *Chuanxiong*, *Xiangfu* (rice-prepared) – 1 *liang* each; *Shenqu* (stir-fried) and *Fuling* – 5 *qian* each; *Juhong* – 4 *qian*; *Gancao* – 2 *qian*.
Grind into powder, form into pills with rice porridge, and take 80 pills per dose.
For heat, add *Huanglian* and *Zhishi* (wheat-fried) – 1 *liang* each.

**Female Emaciation and Infertility**
Women who are emaciated and weak often suffer from blood deficiency and thus cannot conceive. They should regularly take **Dabu Pills**.

**Dabu Pills**
*Tiandong* (heart removed), *Maidong* (heart removed), *Shichangpu*, *Fuling*, *Renshen*, *Yizhiren*, *Gouqizi*, *Digupi*, and *Yuanzhi* (flesh) – equal parts.
Grind into powder, form into pills with honey the size of *tongzi* seeds, and take 30 pills on an empty stomach with wine.

**Chronic Weakness and Infertility**
For a woman to conceive, her qi must be sufficient and her blood abundant to nourish the fetus. If qi is deficient, yang declines; if blood is deficient, yin declines. When both qi and blood are deficient, the uterine chamber sags and cannot ascend, making miscarriage inevitable. **Bazhen Yimu Pills** are indicated.

**Bazhen Yimu Pills**
*Renshen*, *Baizhu* (honey-fried), *Fuling*, and *Chuanxiong* – 1 *liang* each; *Danggui* and *Shudihuang* – 2 *liang* each; *Gancao* (honey-fried) – 5 *qian*; *Baishao* (vinegar-fried) – 1 *liang*; *Yimucao* – 4 *liang* (harvested in the fifth or sixth month, using only the upper half; discard those with leaves; dry in the sun and pound with an iron pestle).
Grind into powder, form into pills with honey the size of *danzi* seeds, and take one pill on an empty stomach with plain boiled water. Smaller pills may also be used.
For those with spleen-stomach deficiency-cold and stagnation, add *Sharen* (stir-fried with ginger juice) – 1 *liang*; for abdominal distension and oppression, add *Shanzha* (steamed with rice) – 1 *liang*; for excessive depression, add *Xiangfu* (wine-processed) – 1 *liang*.

**Exuberant Ministerial Fire in Women**
When ministerial fire is excessive, it scorches the earth like parched soil, making it difficult for plants to grow. Moreover, if fire is exuberant, the man’s essence may ejaculate prematurely while the woman’s desire is not yet aroused—how can conception occur? **Yiyin Decoction** is indicated.

**Yiyin Decoction**
*Gandihuang* and *Shudihuang* – 3 *qian* each; *Baishao*, *Maidong* (heart removed), and *Danshen* – 2 *qian* each; *Niuxi* – 1 *qian* and 5 *fen*; *Gancao* – 1 *qian*.
Decoct in two cups of water until seven-tenths remain.
For exuberant fire with vexation and agitation, add *Guijiao* – 2 *qian*; for qi deficiency, add *Renshen* – 1–2 *qian*; for heart deficiency with insomnia, add *Suanzaoren* and *Danggui* – 1–2 *qian* each.

**Spleen-Stomach Cold in Women**
When the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, the belt vessel loses its strength, and essence may be discharged directly—how can the uterus bear it? **Buzhong Pills** are indicated.

**Buzhong Pills**
*Chuanxiong*, *Danggui*, *Huangqi* (honey-fried), *Baizhu* (honey-fried), *Renshen*, *Baishao*, *Duzhong* (salt-water fried), *Chuanxuduan*, *Ejiao* (pearl-fried), and *Wuweizi* (stir-fried) – 1 *liang* each; *Gancao* (honey-fried) – 5 *qian*.
Grind into powder, form into pills with honey, and take with plain boiled water.

**Qi Stagnation and Infertility in Women**
When a woman’s excessive brooding and depression injure the heart, spleen, and the source of the thoroughfare and conception vessels, her blood and qi gradually wither, leading to menstrual irregularities—how can conception occur? **Hehuan Pills** are indicated.

**Hehuan Pills**
*Danggui* and *Shudihuang* – 3 *liang* each; *Fushen* and *Baishao* – 1.5 *liang* each; *Suanzaoren* (stir-fried) and *Yuanzhi* (processed) – 1 *liang* each; *Xiangfu* (wine-fried) and *Gancao* (honey-fried) – 8 *fen* each.
Grind into powder, form into pills with honey, and take with plain boiled water.
For qi deficiency, add *Renshen* – 1 *liang*.

**Blood Stagnation and Infertility in Women**
When a woman’s blood is deficient and her menses stagnate, accumulating without movement, causing lower abdominal pain and long-term infertility, **Wuwu Decoction** is indicated.

**Wuwu Decoction**
*Danggui* and *Shudihuang* – 3 *qian* each; *Baishao* (wine-fried) – 2 *qian*; *Chuanxiong* and *Rougui* – 1 *qian* each.
Decoct in water and take.
For qi stagnation, add *Xiangfu* (processed) – 1 *qian*; for yang deficiency with mounting pain, add *Xiaohuixiang* – 1 *qian*; for inhibited water pathways, add *Zexie* – 1 *qian*; for nausea and vomiting, add *Ganjiang* – 1 *qian*.

**Menstrual Irregularity and Infertility in Women**
When a woman’s menstrual flow is irregular and her qi and blood are disharmonious, she cannot conceive.

Or, after giving birth to one child, there may be a prolonged interval of many years. **Seed-Jade Wine** is indicated; taken for one hundred days, it can enable conception. If qi and blood are insufficient, with menstrual stagnation and phlegm congealment, take it for half a year, and efficacy will naturally appear.

**Seed-Jade Wine**
*Danggui* (whole) – 5 *liang*, sliced. This moves and nourishes the blood.
*Yuanzhi* – 5 *liang*, washed in licorice decoction. This resolves stagnation within the blood, moves qi, and dissolves phlegm.
