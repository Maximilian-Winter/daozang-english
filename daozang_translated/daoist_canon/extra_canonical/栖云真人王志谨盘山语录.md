# 栖云真人王志谨盘山语录

**Preface to *Recorded Sayings of Perfected One Qiyun, Wang Zhijin, at Mount Pan***

The blind cannot partake of the colors green and yellow, nor can the deaf share in the sounds of pipes and chimes. Is this affliction confined to the body alone? Nay, the mind and intellect suffer likewise. Though the original, Heaven-endowed truth is complete in all, it is obscured by accumulated dust, leaving the true eye unseeing. Chasing after forms and sounds, tracing footprints and tracks, one sinks into evil destinies, passing through a thousand kalpas of rebirth. Mistaking bamboo flutes for sunlight, striking bronze basins for the sun’s reflection—without encountering a true master, how can black and white be distinguished? Clinging to phrases and grasping at texts only deepens confusion. Thus, Master Qiyun, unable to bear this, administered medicine for the affliction, clearing ears and prying open deafness, polishing eyes and scraping away cataracts, hoping that all might see clearly and each awaken to understanding. In seeing and hearing, may they be free and unburdened, all returning to the true Way, no longer chasing the lost sheep.

Master Liu, a disciple of long standing, secretly recorded the master’s every word and sigh, compiling them into a collection of over a hundred entries—truly a guide for beginners on the path of the Dao. He commissioned craftsmen to carve the woodblocks, that its transmission might be broadened. This humble Daoist of Gufeng Peak, though but a latecomer among his disciples, upon seeing this work, rejoiced. With reverence, he purified himself and composed this preface.

**Recorded at Mount Pan on the First Day of the First Month, Dingwei Year**

At that time, the master expounded at Mount Pan:

For beginners on the path of the Dao, if one immediately seeks what lies beyond words, understanding will find no foothold, no reliance, and doubt will surely arise. With no effort in the heart, faith will falter; without faith, there can be no practice; without practice, one strays into reckless learning, and over time, grows weary and retreats. Now, I shall speak to you of what lies before your eyes, what fills your ears—what you can believe and practice. Proceeding from the coarse to the subtle will not lead you astray. Though these are but sounds and forms, they are the very functioning of the Dao.

What, then, is something you can believe? Do you not see the vast emptiness, the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, wind and clouds? Are these not clearly before your eyes? They are the models for cultivation, the gates to entering the Dao.

Consider the clouds emerging from the mountains: they come and go without intent, drifting freely. Nothing in the realm of objects can cling to them—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the wind stirring all things: it blows now here, now there, utterly without stagnation, leaving no trace. Neither grasses nor forests can obstruct it; it passes through with a single sweep—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the great mountains: towering and majestic, steadfast and unshaken. No thing can touch them—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or water: by nature soft and flowing downward, benefiting all beings without contention, conforming to square or round, its essence clear and tranquil. When it gathers into rivers and seas, it embraces the hundred streams without distinction, containing fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs alike—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the sun and moon: their radiance shines without partiality, illuminating all four directions, bright day and night, boundless in clarity—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the heavens above: their substance is ever pure, pure yet all-embracing, covering all without exception. Toward the ten thousand existences, they bring benefit without harm—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the earth below: its substance is ever still, motionless and silent, bearing the weight of all things without favor or bias—so too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be. Or the vastness of empty space: boundless, containing all, embracing all, whether sentient or insentient, covering heaven and supporting earth. It encompasses without discrimination, neither moving nor still, neither being nor non-being, neither identical to nor separate from the ten thousand things. It possesses the clarity of heaven, the stillness of earth, the brightness of sun and moon, and the transformations of the ten thousand things—yet empty space remains one and the same. So too should the heart of the Dao-practitioner be.

The Dao is one with heaven and earth; its functioning is thus. Its essence lies within. When effort is perfected, understanding arises naturally. In activity and repose, it accords with the Dao, and there is always one who presides. If one seeks only the place where words and thoughts cease, one has already missed it. Having entered the mysterious gate, each must strive diligently.

Someone asked: How does a beginner cultivate the heart-ground and enter the gate?

The master replied: Sever with a single stroke all the hearts of affection and attachment, scheming and calculation, forethought and afterthought, deception and entrapment. Abandon entirely the attachments to wine, lust, wealth, and temper; to right and wrong, self and others; to clinging and craving, private and perverse thoughts, desire for gain and sensual pleasure. Externally unburdened, the body becomes light and free; internally unstained, the heart becomes light and free. With long and thorough practice, deluded thoughts will naturally cease. Ever vigilant, guard and attend to it: be cautious in speech, moderate in eating and drinking, reduce sleep. Inner and outer assist one another. When the dust and grime are entirely cleansed, leaving not a single thing behind, in time your original life-spirit will naturally manifest, and you will enjoy freedom—this is the supreme Dao-practitioner.

Someone asked: How does one attain purity and stillness in cultivation?

The master replied: The heart not chasing after things is called a settled heart; the heart not receiving things is called an empty heart. A heart that is settled and empty is pure and still—purity and stillness are the Dao itself.

Someone asked: Cultivators often speak of eliminating emotions and desires. What lies beyond these?

The master replied: Eliminate emotions, and you arrive at non-emotion; eliminate desires, and you arrive at non-desire. Beyond non-emotion and non-desire—what, then, is *this*?

Someone asked: A cultivator must remain unwavering in every moment—how can one achieve this unwavering state?

The master replied: In the beginning, when the heart is untrained, one drifts in and out without awareness, unable to gather or release. When encountering circumstances or things, one clings to them entirely, muddled and confused, only ceasing when utterly exhausted. Failing to recognize oneself is to be in darkness—no different from those reborn in ignorance, slipping unknowingly into another shell, only to return when their karma is exhausted. This is the result of being in darkness. Yet if one relies solely on knowledge and awareness, one is obscured by that very knowledge and awareness. If a cultivator examines themselves in every moment of the day and night, untarnished by worldly dust and emotions, gliding lightly past circumstances and things, this is the unwavering state.

Someone asked: How does one safeguard the matters of nature and life?

The master replied: Even when moving through the myriad dusty realms, though one may harmonize with them, one must remain the master, not blindly following their course. Let affairs not obstruct the heart, nor the heart obstruct affairs. Guard it like the eye—if even the finest speck of dust appears, close the eye and refuse it. Protect it thus, and over time, results will manifest. But if the heart receives anything, it is led away by external things, and one can no longer be the master.

Someone asked: My thoughts follow one after another, and I cannot sweep them away—what should I do?

The master replied:
*Day after day, sweeping the heart’s ground,*
*Sweeping only stirs more unrest.*
*If you wish the heart’s ground to be still,*
*Lay down the broom’s handle.*

The questioner bowed in gratitude.

Someone asked: Those who cultivate must first establish resolve—how does one establish resolve?

The master replied: In every moment, whether in movement or stillness, amid all circumstances, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, let your thoughts rest in the Dao. Unshaken by demons, unmoved by harm, whether in ease or peril, remain thus. Devote this body without hesitation, advancing with unyielding diligence, unafraid of life or death—this is a person of resolve. Thus the sutra says: *"The strong in practice have resolve."*

The master arrived at Nangong and, sitting one night at Changzhen Abbey, addressed the assembly: Those who leave home in the beginning, unable to stand alone, must rely on the monastic community or form bonds with fellow cultivators, supporting one another to avoid bias. Yet there are three kinds of companions: cloud friends and mist companions, good friends and wise friends, and wild friends and strange friends.

Those of noble character, who refine their hearts, investigate karma, sever worldly attachments, and roam beyond the mundane, seeking like-minded companions—these are called cloud friends and mist companions, for their hearts resemble clouds and mist, untouched by worldly affairs. Others study scriptures, play the qin, recite poetry, engage in lofty discussions, and debate right and wrong—these are called good friends and wise friends, for though they do not refine their hearts, they also do no evil. Then there are those who neither cultivate their hearts nor study the classics, heedless of karma. Their words are perverse, their actions reckless. At the slightest provocation, they start quarrels, boast of their strength, flaunt their cunning, bully the good, and form cliques—these are called wild friends and strange friends.

After these three kinds of people pass away, each is placed according to their deeds and receives their due retribution: The cloud friends and mist companions ascend into the formless, roaming the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or celestial officials. The good friends and wise friends, their worldly hearts not yet exhausted, remain within the human realm, cycling through rebirths. The wild friends and strange friends, having received offerings from all directions yet lacking merit, must repay their debts—some fall into Fengdu, others into the realm of beasts, trapped in the suffering of samsara. When it comes to this, what use is regret? Those of wisdom and discernment should ponder this carefully and seek the most advantageous path.

Someone asked: What is the awakened nature?

The master replied: Pointing east and drawing west—set aside such empty gestures. Better to apply real effort. For example, whatever lingers in the heart, whatever appears before the eyes—emotional desires, afflictions, the illusion of self and others—is like a vast, slick well of glass before you. If you do not guard against it in the slightest, you will fall in and remain trapped for ten thousand kalpas. But if you see it clearly and recognize its nature, then as you are about to step forward, swiftly retreat—this very act of swift retreat and vigilance is your awakened nature. If you have clearly fallen into the pit of self and others yet still point to the empty sky and speak of transcendent matters, what has this to do with awakened nature?

Someone asked: What is the stabilized nature?

The master shifted his seat forward, sat upright in silence, and after a long while said: What stabilized nature are you asking about?

The questioner did not understand. Another master present rose, bowed, and expressed gratitude. The master said: *Zhang drinks the wine, but Li gets drunk.* The questioner laughed heartily.

Someone asked: I cultivate primarily for the great matter of life and death, yet my seeking remains unclear, leading to recklessness—what is the meaning of this?

The master replied: A single thought of non-arising is non-dying. Those who cannot achieve this do so because their hearts are entangled in emotions and their natures are stained with dust. As emotions and dust play their games, life and death never cease. To seek liberation, let go of whatever arises, letting go again and again until not a trace remains. The original source is pure—unmoved by sounds, unmoved by forms, at ease wherever you are, empty and carefree, enduring as heaven and earth, the true master naturally revealed.

For when the heart is upright, all affairs are upright; when the heart is crooked, all affairs are crooked. With mastery within, what others love, you do not love; what others dislike, you do not dislike. Every old habit is gradually turned around. The six senses emptied, the true master abides in stillness—what fear of life and death remains?

When one reaches such a state, yet fails to gather and stabilize, unable to contain or conceal, drifting outward like one possessed by spirits or demons—racing wildly, unbridled and reckless—this is the scattering of spirit and qi, losing mastery over oneself. Taking this as true joy, true delight, one mimics the ancients by singing and dancing in the streets, unaware that the ancients, too, once untangled their bonds and found liberation elsewhere, delighting in that alone. How could they have indulged their minds in frantic folly to deceive the world?

Yet they did not know that joy without joy is true joy, delight without delight is true delight, and knowing without knowing is true knowing. Now, swept away by the discriminating mind, with perverse qi invading the heart, one falls into madness and dissipation—no remedy remains.

Someone asked: With eyes open, there are dusty realms; with eyes closed, dream realms; in crowds, realms of adversity and favor—how can one find stability?

The master replied: For the practitioner, gathering the heart is fundamental. When adversity arises, pass through it with joy; when favor arises, pass through it without attachment. What do these dusty realms have to do with you? Among others, even a three-year-old child should not be opposed or offended—always yield to them. When others oppose or offend you, always endure it. Enduring and yielding, the work is naturally accomplished. When all people show respect, when all difficulties are borne by oneself, over time, as the heart and circumstances become pure and familiar, one finds stability everywhere. All realms pass by as ordinary, with no stirring of the heart. Amidst the ten thousand conditions, the heart rests in peace, untouched by even a speck of dust—pure and free, unwavering day and night. This accords with the hearts of sages and worthies.

Someone asked: "To know the One is to complete all things," and yet it is also said: "Embrace the primordial and guard the One." What is this One?

The master said: It is the undifferentiated nature, the state without discrimination. Once you know of its existence, you fall into enumeration and can no longer be one. One gives rise to two, two to three, and three to the ten thousand things—how can it be guarded? It is better to be without even the One. Thus, the ancestral master said: "Embracing the primordial and guarding the One is effort—yet in the enduring vastness, there is not even a One." From this place of not even a One, one illuminates one’s own fundamental nature—how could it be nothing?

Thus, the sutra says: "To know emptiness as not empty, to know form as not form—this is called illumination."

Someone asked: Among those who leave the household life, some study the ancients’ cases, some study scriptures, and some say that the ancient teachings illuminate the heart—is this correct?

The master said: The practitioner’s work is to refine the heart, to ascend from the ordinary to the sacred. Yet since leaving the household, they have not made this their task, instead searching through the words of the ancients, making a livelihood from ink and paper, counting lines and tallying characters, entangling themselves in vines of discourse. They exhaust all effort—what good does it do? When King Yama comes to call, not a single phrase, not a single word will serve. They would have been better off passing their days in ignorance. Take the effort now spent in such pursuits and direct it toward one’s own fundamental work—then time will not be wasted in vain.

What is one’s own fundamental work? It is this single point of luminous clarity that governs the body, received from the Dao, pristine and constant from ancient times to the present—what more could one desire? When one clarifies and understands this principle, it becomes the warrant for transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred. If you trust this, begin at once to work on it. You, too, have such a case—why count others’ treasures? Quickly make use of it yourself, and from now on, you will not be deceived by others.

Once, while the master was engaged in labor, he gave a general discourse: Long ago, beneath the Eastern Hall, there was a man named Zhang Xian who was skilled in carpentry. He never opposed others, was humble and yielding, and never showed anger in his expression. The assembly all approved and constantly praised him, and word reached the Perfected One. The Perfected One said: Not yet. Let us test him first—like gold that has not been refined, its authenticity is unknown.

One day, he was ordered to make a meditation bench. The man assented and began the work. Before it was finished, he was ordered to make doors and windows, and he provisionally complied. Already, a hint of impatience arose. Before half the work was done, he was ordered to make several boxes. The man refused and argued before the Perfected One, insisting on completing one task before starting another.

The Perfected One then said: Previously, everyone praised you for being able to respond to others without opposition, never losing your composure. Today, the test has revealed the truth. For the practitioner, refining the heart in response to circumstances is paramount. With inner mastery, one is at ease and harmonious; outwardly, one responds to affairs with perfect accuracy. What is urgent, what can wait—one acts from what is most pressing, even if it means grinding one’s bones to dust, yet the heart remains unmoved. What difference does it make whether this task or that is done first?

All are but transient things—what fixed essence do they possess? The heart must die, the mechanism must live; simply respond to what is most pressing in the moment, calmly and steadily, unmoved and unobscured. This is what is meant by "constantly responding, constantly still."

Someone asked: "There are those who say that karmic retribution spans three lifetimes—is this true?"
The answer: "Have you not heard the ancient saying: *'When enlightened, karmic obstacles are fundamentally empty; when unenlightened, one must repay past debts.'* Once, a man bore malignant sores so agonizing that pus and blood flowed unceasingly. Unable to endure, he sought a secluded place and hanged himself. Such a person, neither having understood his own nature nor willing to bear the debt of pus and blood from a past life, though he brought about his own death, would still have to repay it in his next existence. How do we know this was past karma? There was once a high official—whose name need not be mentioned, for the law of cause and effect suffices—whose nature was cruel and tyrannical. Whenever displeased, he would beat his attendants and servants. One day, he suddenly felt an itching pain on his buttocks; scratching it only tore the skin, and gradually, flesh split open as if freshly flogged, the pain unbearable until he died. Thus, we know that debts of pus and blood must inevitably be repaid. Not only this, but even minor matters—joy and anger, slander and praise, blows and scoldings, right and wrong, aversion upon meeting—all are old karmic entanglements from past causes, now demanding repayment in this life. One must accept them gladly, without protest, enduring with patience; only then is the debt repaid. If one contests, it is like refusing to settle a debt, deepening the accumulation, binding the karmic knot ever tighter, with no end in sight. Moreover, Heaven favors repayment; even the grievances and injuries between people are nothing but karmic debts.

Once, when the Perfected One Changchun resided at Changchun Abbey, a great army suddenly returned from the north. He hid in the distance to avoid them but encountered a nobleman he knew well, whose family had long practiced the Dao. The nobleman said his wife had been captured and that he wished to exhaust his family’s wealth to ransom her and let her leave the world. He sought the Perfected One’s counsel, but Changchun flatly refused. By the time the matter was discussed, the army had already moved far away. Later, the nobleman asked why he had refused. The Perfected One said: 'Your wife and her captor share a three-year karmic debt. Now that they have met, it is their past affinity. In three years, she will return here to leave the world.' Indeed, three years later, she was released, took up the hairpin and robe, and came to Changchun Abbey to pay respects to the Perfected One. Through her lifelong practice of goodness, she was able to enter the Dao. Only then did the nobleman believe and bow in gratitude without end.

The Master, seeing a Daoist practitioner ill, expounded: 'For those who cultivate the Way, eating and drinking are measured, movement and stillness are regular, the heart and spirit are at peace, and there is no reckless action. If illness arises by chance, it is Heaven’s decree—how could one dare refuse it? It is also the unfolding of one’s own fate, or perhaps a karmic affliction from past causes. First, one must see through the four great elements as illusory. If sick, let it be sick; if dying, let it be dying. The heart remains patient and enduring, allowing transformations to take their course. If the mind is not fixed on illness, severe illness lightens, and mild illness heals on its own. With the inherent nature at peace, turbid and noxious qi disperse. This is repaying the debt of illness, passing through another barrier. If one does not understand this, the heart will be unsettled. At the slightest ailment, the mind becomes frantic, wailing ceaselessly, crying out in pain, cursing Heaven and Earth, resenting others for not supporting, blaming them for not seeking a physician, scolding them for not preparing medicine, reproaching them for not inquiring after one’s health. All the while, the dark karma of ignorance arises, leaving no rightful path. One forgets that life and death are already determined—what use is panic? The heart grows even more disturbed, unable to find peace. Moreover, one does not realize that the heart is the master of the body. If the master is not at ease, the whole body falls into chaos. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *'A flustered heart and scattered mind are the gates to hell'*? Such a state invites transgressions. In this way, mild illness turns severe, and severe illness leads to death, for one’s nature is clouded by turbidity. If one’s actions lack restraint and illness arises from excess, it is self-inflicted—who else can one blame? Those who cultivate the heart-ground would never act thus. Let each reflect on this."

A master, seeing a patient at the brink of death unable to depart, addressed all present: "Those who cultivate the Way must first see through the illusory nature of all worldly conditions, and next recognize this bodily form as but a heap of dust. In daily affairs, remain detached; at the hour of departure, one will naturally attain freedom.

Once in Shandong, an abbot lay dying, lingering without release. Someone was sent to inquire of Master Changchun. The master replied: 'In life, he clung to external conditions and objects, neglecting inner cultivation—thus he remains entangled, unable to break free.' He sent these words: *'This body is not yours; your nature is fundamentally empty. When not a single thought arises, lay down the whole body.'* Upon hearing this, the abbot seemed to awaken. He instructed his fellow practitioners: 'I was deluded by external conditions, neglecting the work of the heart-ground. Now, at the threshold of death, I falter. I urge you all: devote yourselves to cultivating body and mind, and resolve this great matter of life and death.' With that, he passed away.

Another Daoist, nearing death, could not depart. He asked those around him: 'How can I go?' One said: 'Meditate on truth.' He meditated for days but still could not go. Another said: 'Meditate on emptiness.' Again, he could not go. An old immortal heard of this and came to see him. The man recounted his previous attempts, yet still could not depart. The old immortal rebuked him: 'What did you bring when you came? What do you seek to take when you go? Rest in equanimity and await your time—when it comes, you will depart.' The sick man bowed in gratitude and died.

Generally, those who cultivate the Way regard all external conditions as provisional tools for the present moment, while their true nature requires steadfast effort. If one moves through worldly affairs with detachment, how could one fail to be detached at the hour of death? If one clings to things and affairs, how could one be detached then? Cultivate diligently—life and death are unpredictable. When the day comes, what use are external conditions? Let each reflect on this."

The master also said: "Those who cultivate the Way must first establish resolve. Yet once resolve is set, many become rigid. Rigidity prevents adaptability in worldly affairs. Even if one becomes adaptable, one may grow complacent, letting days slip by. Thus, learners are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns.

Those with resolve often lack understanding; those with understanding often fail to act; those who act often do not persevere. In cultivating the Dao, one must first return to the ancestral source, then establish resolve. One must discern adaptability, remain single-minded, and practice diligently without cease—then success is assured."

Someone asked: "What is the ever-constant Dao?"
The master replied: "Set aside the ever-constant for now. In the twelve hours of day and night, examine your own heart-ground. Observe: what is it before thoughts arise? When thoughts arise, discern whether they are deluded or upright. Eradicate deluded thoughts; employ upright ones.

What is a deluded thought? When idle, all anticipatory musings are false and errant. What is an upright thought? When faced with affairs—serving others, benefiting beings, honoring superiors, pacifying the multitude—all good intentions not for oneself are upright thoughts. In stillness, embody tranquility; in activity, act with rectitude. Neither indulgent nor restrained, neither day nor night obscured, moment by moment unclouded—constantly responsive, constantly still, steady and serene—this is the ever-constant Dao."

The master also said: "Those who cultivate the Way struggle with this obstinate heart, which since beginningless time has cycled through rebirth, piling bones like mountains, dying and being born ten thousand times. Only now do they awaken to past errors and seek liberation. Thus, they dare not eat by day nor sleep by night, refining this obstinate heart, inverting every convention to make it serviceable. Without refining the heart, even if one mimics others—staying awake, suppressing thoughts—when touched, anger flares like smoke and fire. What use is a hundred years of sleeplessness? If the obstinate heart remains, one still cycles through rebirth.

To transform this heart, day and night, in movement and stillness, shatter this obstinate heart to pieces—only then can it be of use. The original true spirit resembles heaven and earth. Then, stillness is the Dao, activity is the Dao, speaking is the Dao, silence is the Dao—what more is there to seek? One becomes a Daoist free and unburdened."

The master often said: "Those who cultivate the Way must apply effort to refine and relinquish the deeply ingrained habits of their minds. Even this body, when its time comes, must be abandoned—how much more so the illusions of the heart? Remove them all, and no afflictions or obstacles remain. External affairs and things need not occupy the mind; the comings and goings of the present are like mosquitoes—brushed away, one feels at ease. Yet the thoughts hard to dispel from the heart—these are the seeds of rebirth.

When Master Changchun dwelled at Pan Ravine, tigers and leopards came and went at night, appearing morning and evening. Initially fearful, he considered building a fence. Then he reflected: 'In such a place, with this fear, I seek to shield myself—can I truly evade life and death?' He let it be, remaining unshaken, accepting life and death as they came. Fear vanished, and amid the trials of life and death, he stood firm and unmoved. All bonds dissolved at once—this is practicing the difficult.

The master also said: "Those who cultivate the Way must thoroughly investigate the great matter of life and death. Apply effort to yourself, day and night, with an undisturbed mind and purified senses."

When encountering realms of sound and form, see as if not seeing, hear as if not hearing—let nothing take root within the heart. Others may stir and clamor, but these are not one’s own affairs, like wind passing before the eyes.

The master also said: "Those who cultivate the Way should only observe the good in others’ actions and emulate it themselves. Do not fixate on others’ faults, lest you lose yourself. Do not engage in mutual fault-finding. To harbor right and wrong is to have an unaligned mind; progress will be long delayed. The upright can suppress the crooked, while the crooked constantly slander the upright. Those who cling to the notion of self and habitually slander others fail to understand themselves—they belong to heterodox and perverse traditions. If one possesses true knowledge and right view, one must examine one’s own mind for bias and error, searching out one’s own faults. To meddle in others’ wrongs is not the way of the upright."

Someone asked: "What are *gong* and *xing*?"
He replied: "Closing the mouth is *gong*; opening the mouth is *xing*."

"What does it mean to close the mouth as *gong*?"
"To attain through silence, without thought or worry, sealing the mouth and forgetting speech, seeking no recognition, concealing one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—this is closing the mouth as *gong*."

"What does it mean to open the mouth as *xing*?"
"To offer expedient means, teach others to practice, benefit all beings, and point the way to the true Dao—this is opening the mouth as *xing*."

Someone asked: "Are seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, grasping, walking, and thinking the nature?"
He replied: "The nature of the Dao is neither identical to nor separate from these. Movement and stillness, speech and silence—these are the functions of nature, not its essence. The essence of nature is neither moving nor still, neither speaking nor silent. An ancient said: *'To know the ancestral source of the great Dao, do not depart from movement and stillness, speech and silence.'* Yet if you take movement and stillness, speech and silence as the nature, you mistake the servant for the master. The master commands the servant—how could the servant be the master? All lifting of hands and moving of feet, all speech, seeing, and hearing, all myriad forms and postures, even long periods of stillness—these are all servants, not the master. The master in the hall never reveals itself outwardly, yet those who receive its use and command naturally take themselves as the master."

Someone asked: "If I devote three years to rigorous practice, can I escape rebirth?"
He replied: "Those who cultivate the Way must establish resolute determination, refining the mind with unceasing diligence, moment by moment. Do not presume upon the future or harbor conceit, hoping for liberation. Once, a Daoist novice left the household life and boasted: *'Rebirth is a trifle—I need only apply some effort to be free of it.'* Though he began with resolve, an unexpected grave illness befell him, lingering for years and gradually eroding his will. How could this be achieved with arrogance?"

Someone asked: "When I walk or sit alone in the mountains, I personally witness mountain spirits foretelling future events—is this real?"
He replied: "The minds of ordinary people cling to the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, dull and unclear. When beginners leave the household life, they grind away at the dust of the mind. If they happen to attain stillness, they may suddenly perceive a tranquil realm, giving rise to strange visions—phantasmal apparitions they mistake for the mind-ground. Overjoyed, they sing and dance without cease. Some may see future events, or hear voices in the void foretelling things that later come to pass, or even witness past masters, true spirits, or divine beings appearing before them to entrust matters of the mind-ground. If one clings to these experiences, one falls into delusion. If not dispelled, they become a sickness of the mind, incurable by any method. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *'Seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing are also afflictions'*? How much more so for what the eyes see, the ears hear, and the mind thinks—all belong to the realm of sound and form. Have you not heard the sutra: *'It cannot be seen by sight, cannot be heard by hearing, cannot be spoken of in words, cannot be reached by thought'*? To take what appears in the realm of sound and form as real is to fall into heterodox paths.

Once, a Daoist in meditation suddenly tasted wine in his mouth and dreamed of someone offering him wine. The next day, someone indeed brought him wine. This is the mind’s emptiness resonating with spirits—nothing extraordinary. To cling to it is to fall into heterodoxy. Another Daoist, while sitting, suddenly felt his spirit leave his body and wander hundreds of steps away before returning, seeing his original form still seated upright. Though this happened several times, it was nothing extraordinary—merely the usual wandering of thoughts, only slightly more distinct. To regard it as an achievement is to fall into delusion. A folk saying goes: *'A thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; ordinary peace and stability accord with the Dao.'*

When the assembly discussed the opening of *Zhizang* (Treasury of Wisdom), with words flowing like a spring, the master said: "Those who cultivate the Way, in their initial resolve, depart from the dust, like a mirror newly polished. When the Treasury of Wisdom suddenly opens, thoughts become verses—do not cling to them. If the mind becomes fixed, functioning without stimulus, it turns into wild wisdom, devoid of merit. This is merely the functioning of spirit, not the essence of the Dao. Do not parade it as a skill; only through nurturing and refinement does merit arise."

When the assembly discussed dwelling in the mountains, the master said: "Those who cultivate the Way must see through people when they come and respond to circumstances as they arise. Each response is like a single act—once past, it is past. Once, a Daoist dwelled in the mountains, wearing clothes of grass and eating wild plants, vowing never to descend, believing he had cast off all worldly entanglements. One day, two men bearing weapons came demanding food. The master quickly cooked mountain fruits for them, but before they softened, one of the men reached into the pot, tasted them, and angrily said: *'Such things are not fit for human consumption!'* He was about to smash the pot. The master said nothing. Seeing the men’s anger and hearing their harsh words, he secretly devised a plan. On the pretext of leaving, he found the staff he had hidden, grasped it firmly, and shouted: *'You two, come out! You may not be able to get near me!'* "

The two men stepped outside and laughed, saying: *"Master, dwelling in the mountains has nurtured such a triumphant heart in you—better to descend and become an ordinary man."* With that, they departed, and as he watched, they suddenly vanished. The master then suspected they were sages testing him and regretted deeply. This was a trial he had failed at the threshold of circumstance.

The master, undisturbed by the opinions of others, once said: *"Long ago in Shandong, a Daoist boasted to his teacher that he had refined away the fire of ignorance."* The master replied: *"If the fire of ignorance is extinguished, the heart remains unmoved—then you are a good man."* Later, the master secretly sent someone to test him.

At dusk, the man arrived at the hermitage, but the gate was already shut. He raised his voice and struck the door violently with his staff. The Daoist inside responded, his tone already unsettled. With reluctance, he opened the door, and seeing the visitor’s fierce demeanor, his expression shifted. When they entered the hall, the man did not remove his shoes but leapt onto the seat, utterly lacking in courtesy. The Daoist grew furious and severely rebuked him. The man clasped his hands and smiled: *"I dared not act so—your teacher sent me to test whether your heart remains unmoved. Now, before the trial even began, it was already evident. No further testing is needed."* The Daoist was deeply ashamed, left with no words to reply.

Generally, even those who cultivate the Way, though they may have skill, dare not boast of it. Unawares, they are exposed in the trial. Only when one truly reaches the state of a withered heart and emaciated form does the thought of self-praise vanish. Once self-praise arises, the trial is already failed. Even if one attains the state of immovability, there is still more beyond.

The master, discussing the practice of dwelling in seclusion and guarding stillness, said: *"Once, a Daoist had sat in a walled enclosure for years. One day, the community asked him to come out, and he moved about freely. An old friend saw him and asked: ‘Brother, what you gained in stillness—can it be applied amid clamor? I wonder if you have truly reached the point of immovability.’* The man grew haughty and remained silent for a long while. The friend pressed on: *"I have a touchstone to distinguish truth from falsehood. Brother, try speaking of the heart you attained in years of stillness—let us see how it fares."* The man replied: *"What is there to say of stillness?"* The friend said: *"If it is like this, then you will repay your debt with fur and horns."* The man flew into a rage, hurling insults. The friend laughed: *"This is what you gained in your enclosure—truly tested now."* The man grew resentful and cut off the friendship for life.

This man had never tempered his heart amid circumstances. Though he sat in stillness for a hundred years, it was all in vain. He was like a horse tethered in place—once the rope is untied, it bolts as before. *(A walled enclosure: a single room built within a circular wall, sealed except for a small window to receive food, allowing the practitioner to focus solely on cultivation. To sever ties with friends: to devote oneself entirely to practice.)*

The master once said: *"A cultivator is like a master carpenter hewing wood—first, one must align the heart’s inked line, then gradually apply axe and adze to the crooked and wayward parts, shaping it into proper timber for use as needed. One must not disturb the heart’s inked line; if it is lost, there will be no standard to follow. When the crooked and wayward are fully pared away and the heart’s inked line stands true, it will naturally resonate with others, and all implements may be fashioned."*

The master also said: *"A cultivator should always keep the heart free of affairs, upright and proper, moment by moment, hour by hour, examining the true abode of one’s original life and primordial spirit, clear and unobscured, merging with the vast emptiness—only then is this the heart of one who walks the Way. Through accumulated days and piled-up effort, spiritual verification will naturally arise. Thus, all manifold activities are not as good as ceasing and examining oneself. If one constantly directs the mind toward external things, drifting through days in habitual routine, it differs not at all from the mundane heart."*

When the assembly discussed taking up the abbot’s seat, the master said: *"A cultivator who assumes the abbot’s role must measure his own strength, move with simplicity and ease, and pass the days lightly. He must not vie with the worldly for fame and profit, thereby losing his original heart and forgetting the great cause of life and destiny—this is the true principle. If one can temper the mind in this way, turning reluctance into willingness, facing hardship with resolve, and attaining a heart that is stable and unshaken, then in receiving guests from all directions, one benefits both self and others, settles the mind, and accumulates practice—merit and conduct will both be complete. If one does not temper the heart but mistakes things for the self, one will remain bound by stingy and greedy habits, narrow and constricted, chasing after transgressions and worldly concerns, thus ruining one’s future path."*

The master, urging the assembly to dwell in the monastic community, said: *"Master Danyang’s lyric states: ‘To learn the Dao, dwell in the monastic community, assess depth and shallowness, and choose the good as your intimate friends.’ If one has not yet grasped the ultimate principle, holding fast to the essentials, then in the monastic community, all instruct one another, lifting the guiding threads and holding the key points, together cultivating the supreme Dharma-gate of the mind-ground—this is no small matter. There are those without insight or aspiration who neither seek wise companions nor dwell in the monastic community, idly speaking of wandering, yet without discussing the mind-ground. They go south and north, across a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers, wasting straw sandals in vain, only seeking places of convenience and ease. At the slightest touch or bump, they flee at once. When it comes to finding a good place for themselves or seeking favorable conditions, such monastics know not what is most urgent for themselves, nor how to pass the days. They merely seek ease—this is all. Yet they do not realize that ahead lies the decisive arrival of birth and death. What will you rely on to cope? How can one drift through days, squandering time? What did you originally leave the household to pursue? Clear-minded gentlemen, ponder this carefully."*

When those engaged in labor grew restless, the master said: *"Though external conditions for cultivators are provisional, one cannot fail to respond. Respond without self, the substance of the heart empty and vast. When matters arise, there is no obstruction—thus, emptiness does not obstruct the ten thousand affairs, nor do the ten thousand affairs obstruct emptiness. Like the myriad forms and beings in heaven and earth, all move of themselves, without hindrance. If the mind harbors the notion of self, matters will provoke opposition, leading to friction. One cannot pass through swiftly, and upon encountering obstacles, the self’s heart is stirred. Once the self’s heart is stirred, there is no peace. Though one toils all day, the labor is in vain. Dwelling in the great assembly and engaging in work, one must vigilantly guard the self’s heart, not allowing it to be easily moved. Constantly search for one’s own faults, never mind the faults of others—this is merit and conduct. When matters arise, one must take them on. Amidst the ten thousand conditions and dusts, do not follow them. With a heart that is bright and clear, do not discriminate—passing days thus, the beginner’s mind does not retreat, and great merit is naturally attained."*

The master said: *"A cultivator with one part effort generates one part of a superior mind; with ten parts effort, ten parts of a superior mind arise. Once there is a superior mind, there is the notion of self. The notion of self and the superior mind create great obstructions—how can one attain the state where the heart is empty and conditions cease? One must resolutely add determination, placing one’s own body and mind beneath the ten thousand things, always staying behind others, thinking oneself a thousand, ten thousand times inferior to others—only then can the mind of pride and superiority be dispelled. When the heart is like the great void, there is no self; without self, one resonates with the Dao."*

The master said: *"The states encountered by cultivators in stillness are manifold, all transformations of one’s own consciousness arising from stillness to entice the sovereign heart. Have you not heard the ancient saying: ‘All conditioned things are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow’? If one wishes to dispel consciousness, yet consciousness remains, it will transform into forms and images—demonic heads and ghostly faces—confusing the master of the heart. If the master remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, the body like empty space, with no place to abide, they will naturally dissipate. There will be no conditions to demonize, no things to corrupt."*

*"Once there was a Daoist who had attained rest for the heart. One day, as he sat, he suddenly saw countless evil spirits descending from the sky. The man stabilized his heart, his body like empty space, darkly undiscriminating. He staked his life, willing to live or die. The demons dispersed of themselves, for there was a master within, serene and unmoving—how could there be demonic illusions? The deluded mind not yet exhausted manifests such forms. When the nature is profoundly still, they vanish of themselves."*

Someone asked: *"What of the merit of one who practices in a walled enclosure?"*
The master replied: *"When Master Changchun was in Shandong, he came to a temple where there was one sitting in a walled enclosure. As the assembly prepared the vegetarian feast, someone informed the master: ‘The gentleman in the enclosure wishes to speak with you.’ The master instructed that they meet after the feast. Unexpectedly, the master went out and came to the enclosure. He struck the door loudly with his staff several times. The gentleman inside, thinking it an ordinary person, responded in anger. The master then turned away."*

After the feast, the assembly again requested that they meet. The master said: *"I have already tested him. This man still harbors the mind of ‘I’—he is not yet fit for discourse."* And so he departed.

Generally speaking, dwelling in stillness is fundamentally for the great matter of nature and life, to gather and secure, to nurture as one’s work. Unmoved by circumstances—this is the proof. Now, the sound of the knocking at the door was a circumstance; the response was the mind. If the mind had forgotten the self, it would be like cold ashes extinguished, stirred yet without flame. Unmoved by circumstances, calmly passing through—this is the sign of work upon the mind. Now, hearing a trifling empty sound, he was already moved in heart. How could he ever pass through all adverse circumstances? Though he sits in a walled enclosure, what use is it? Accepting others’ offerings, how can he repay such a debt of the mouth? Far better to turn toward the realm of activity, toward affairs and things, and single-mindedly temper this heart—such a one is a person of true insight.

Someone asked: *"Those who cultivate the Way speak of knowing and awakening, yet also call them illness. What is the meaning?"*
The master replied: *"True knowing is the knowing of not-knowing; true awakening is the awakening of no-awakening. The original true spirit, obscured for ten thousand kalpas, has only now awakened—this is called awakening. All knowing and seeing arise from this. If one speaks of having knowing and having awakening, and insists on constant knowing and constant awakening, this is self-entanglement, self-imposed moxibustion upon a body without illness. If one is utterly without knowing and without awakening, one will simply penetrate into another shell. Having awakened to the original source, knowing and awakening are but tools for use. Use them when needed, but do not make them constant."*

The master said: *"When one who cultivates the Way suddenly stills the dusty mind and extinguishes worldly cares, the original true source of the self stands revealed alone—this is the primordial master who has always been. Once one takes up this burden, one is carefree and at ease, and all dharmadhātus are penetrated at once. If one reaches this state, one must conceal one’s light and hide one’s traces, protect and nurture it—more yields more merit. If one raises the intention to display it, one will unknowingly dim one’s radiance."*

The master said: *"Those who cultivate the Way differ in the sharpness of their nature. Those of dull nature should not cling rigidly. They ought to dwell in the assembly, humble their minds, and form affinities with those who understand principle and illuminate the mind. When the affinity ripens, they will naturally be guided into the Dao and gradually awaken. If one’s nature is dull and stagnant, and one has no insight, yet daily keeps company with those of the same kind, associating with worldly dust, the dusty circumstances will ripen, and one will surely retreat from the Dao. One may encounter demonic realms, perceive hellish visions, with no one to save them, sinking forever—how deeply lamentable!"*

The master said: *"Once, a man dwelling in a walled enclosure heard others speak of the ‘ground of realization.’ After entering the enclosure, he wished to see this ground. As this thought arose, it manifested in response. Not knowing it was false—what the ears heard belonged to sound, what the eyes saw belonged to form, what the mind imagined belonged to delusion—he saw golden youths and jade maidens, true immortals and sages appearing in form, seen clearly in broad daylight. Yet this was but an illusory realm, created by deluded thought. Taking it for the ground of realization, he could not break free, muddling through his life, ensnared by demons and spirits. He did not know that the ‘ground of realization’ is where the ancients’ minds and actions reached a state of stability and rest—hence the name. Like a place where one dwells, clearing brambles, sweeping away rubble, the ground is leveled so one may reside—this is called the ‘ground of realization.’ For one who cultivates the Way, when the mind-ground is stable and unmoved by contact with affairs, this is the ‘unmoving ground of realization.’ When the ten thousand dusts cannot stain it, this is the ‘pure ground of realization.’ When one’s original dharmakāya is revealed, bright and clear in every part, and one can take it up—this is the ‘luminously complete ground of realization.’ All such ‘grounds of realization’ have boundaries and limits. If one reaches the state of no ground, no direction, beyond names and words—this is what is called ‘mysterious and again mysterious.’ How could one claim that what is seen by the eyes, heard by the ears, or imagined by the mind is the ultimate?"*

The master said: *"Non-action is the Way of Heaven; action is the way of man. Non-action is one with Heaven; action is one with man. Like a man carrying a burden—if both ends are balanced, it rests steadily. If one end is dropped, it becomes lopsided. If both ends are let go, even the carrying pole is gone, and one returns to the original state."*

The master said: *"Once, during rain at the Eastern Hall, the manager called for general labor, regardless of age, to move bricks. All competed to respond, except for one old immortal who sat unmoving. When the task was done, the assembly gathered. Someone spoke of this to Master Changchun, who rebuked them: ‘Bricks all broken—what are they worth? One person tempering the mind, truly reaching the place of rest, is like a priceless jewel.’ Consider each person’s mind-ground and how it is applied! In the teaching, obtaining the right person is most precious."*

The master said: *"Once, beneath Master Changchun’s hall, there was one who served in the kitchen. All praised his gentleness and humility, saying he was never moved in heart. The master, knowing this, secretly had someone test him. In the morning, they moved the miscellaneous items in the kitchen to another place. When the man went to prepare congee, soaking the rice and filling the pot, he urgently sought the ladle and scoop but could not find them. The congee overflowed, and he was greatly disturbed in heart. Seeing this, the master taught: ‘Even if it all spilled, it is but an external thing. Why let it harm the mind?’ The man then awakened and bowed in gratitude without end."*

A physician asked: *"I practice medicine and have revived over a hundred people from death. What is the karmic result?"*
The master replied: *"Even if you saved all the people in the world, it would not compare to saving yourself from the cycle of birth and death. Worldly blessings have limits, but if you cultivate to the state beyond birth and death, this blessing is boundless."*

A craftsman asked: *"I built a great hall without asking for wages. With such sincerity, what karmic result will there be?"*

The master replied: *"It is not as good as a person of purity sitting in stillness for a single hour. For the blessings of action may decay, but the blessings of non-action never decay."*

The master addressed the assembly: *"In this world, all that one does and all that one makes will inevitably bring retribution. Thus, those who embody the Dao attain the Dao; those who perform blessings receive blessings; those who commit evil receive evil. Those who love others are loved in return; those who hate others are hated in return. Those who respect others are respected; those who slight others are slighted. Those who humble themselves are elevated; those who trust others are trusted. Those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed. Those who exalt themselves are suppressed; those who seek precedence are contested. Those who are self-assertive are opposed. As the saying goes: ‘Plant orchids and you reap fragrance; plant millet and you reap grain.’ Such is the principle of retribution. If one acts with a mind for profit, dissembling and deceiving to win the hearts of others, one loses authenticity."*

The master said: *"For those who cultivate the Way, the greatest taboo is speaking of others’ strengths and weaknesses, right and wrong, or the rise and fall of worldly affairs—matters unrelated to oneself. Such things must not be discussed with the mouth nor pondered in the heart. To speak of right and wrong is to obscure one’s own clarity. If one focuses on refining the heart and constantly examines one’s own faults, how can there be time to meddle in the affairs of others? In all people, there is some good worth emulating; the faults of others should be avoided, not dwelt upon. Gradually, one attains stillness."*

The master addressed the assembly: *"For those who cultivate the Way: if you wish to attain the Dao in your hometown, do not stay; if you wish to ascend to immortality after eating meat and drinking wine, do not indulge; if you wish your family to become immortals, do not cling to them. Do not love what others love; do not condemn what others do not. Do not mistake your own delusions for truth. Do not seek the Dao in sleep—awake! Do not associate with unwholesome companions; do not speak useless words. When things go well, do not rejoice; when they go ill, do not grieve. Learn from those better than yourself; teach those who are not. When others wrong you, it is your fortune; when you wrong others, it is your misfortune. Words beyond deeds are empty; deeds beyond words are solid. Desire and emotion belong to the world of men; a heart free of dust belongs to the immortal’s path. To willingly humble oneself is to be exalted; to willingly embrace poverty is to be enriched. Returning to the constant and aligning with the Dao, following principle and harmonizing with others—this is the upright path to walk. Do not enter deviant gates. Penetrate the Dao, illuminate virtue, and embody both substance and function in perfect completion—this is called the Perfected Whole."*

The master said: *"In ancient times, those who studied the Dao, if their hearts were not yet enlightened, would travel a thousand miles to seek a teacher and inquire. If their affinity was true and their hearts were clear, free of doubt, they might then dwell in a humble hut, or lodge in forests and springs, or beg in the marketplace, or establish a temple. They would settle their hearts, guard the Dao, and remain unchanged—such were the superior cultivators of truth. There are those who leave the household life, yet their nature remains unclear. Lazy in inquiry, proud and competitive, they cling to their own views, feigning the appearance of a high adept. They neglect their practice and lose their conduct, falling short in both worlds. They accept offerings from others without considering whether their own virtue is sufficient to receive them. Such people are unfit for seclusion, unfit for begging—when the hour of life and death arrives, they will be of no use. For they refuse to apply effort to the root, and even after a hundred years, they will have achieved nothing."*

The master said: *"Those who cultivate the Way should gather their hearts like a wooden statue of a sage seated in the hall. Whether no one is present all day or whether banners and canopies surround it, whether incense and flowers are offered or whether slander and praise come and go—it remains thus. The difference is that the wooden statue does not come alive, while the cultivator’s heart is spiritually awakened, vibrant and clear, illuminating the Dao and virtue. Yet in all matters and all things, it does not cling."*

The master said: *"The Daoist refines the heart like forging gold into a rooster. Though its form resembles a rooster, its heart remains unmoved. It stands alone among the flock, and though roosters are combative, none dare approach. The one who embodies the Dao has a heart like cold ashes and a form like withered wood. Though the world may be full of those who love to contend, none can contend with such a one. Thus the scripture says: ‘Only because they do not contend does the world not contend with them.’"*

The master said: *"This true heart—embodying substance and function, free of self and other, upright and proper—has been received since before the primordial chaos, before heaven and earth existed. It cannot be called existent, nor can it be called nonexistent. All sages and worthies of ancient and present times, all Daoists under heaven, have received this and then put it to use. The thousands of scriptures and ten thousand treatises, even the entire canon, speak only of this. Heaven is guided by it, earth is guided by it—even the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, the boundless expanse of emptiness, are governed by this subtle principle. Those who comprehend it are not led astray by external things, not manipulated by thoughts and concerns, not deceived by the six senses. This is the daily practice of immortals, the conduct of sages, the path of those who advance in the Dao."*

The master said: *"When dwelling in a monastery, people gather from all directions—how could they all be the same, each one identical? It is like a great mountain, where all manner of plants grow: some are useless, some become timber, some stand alone, some cling to others. There are rare and auspicious sprouts, and there are wild brambles and thorns—all different, each following its nature and growing freely, each in its own order. The mountain stands majestically, making no distinctions, yet embracing all. Flowing water and piled stones, lush forests and abundant grasses, beasts running and birds singing—all manifest wondrous spiritual workings, each supporting the other. Like hemp supporting the mallow, they grow straight without need of support. Over time, each attains its fulfillment. If one sought to cut the long to patch the short, or change green to yellow, not only would none find peace, but their original nature would be lost."*

The Master said: In former days when I dwelt as abbot in Shandong, I shut my door all day and received no visitors, passing over a decade thus. My heart was set on stillness, yet I performed no meritorious deeds. Sitting alone where none came near, untouched by others—without encountering circumstances or things—how could this heart reveal either completion or ruin? It was but time idly spent. If heaven did not benefit things, the four seasons would not turn; if earth did not benefit things, the myriad beings would not grow. Failing to benefit oneself and others, what virtue is there? Thus the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring said: *"In movement, bring peace to people and benefit to things"*—for this accords with the Dao of heaven and earth.

The Master said: If a cultivator’s Mysterious Pass remains blocked and their mind-ground unclear, their karmic consciousness cannot abide in non-action—this is due to lack of merit and power. They should instead apply effort within the realm of action, following the teachings according to their capacity. Receive those who come with humility, keep the mind lowly, revere teachers and companions, constantly practice kindness, and cast aside selfishness and deceit. Over time, as conditions ripen, daily progress will bring breakthroughs. Is this not far better than carrying an empty burden at both ends? Unable to abide in non-action, yet unable to act—drifting through days without merit or practice, settling into comfort, indulging the palate, meddling in worldly affairs, seeking prominence in bustling places, indulging body and mind without fear of the divine, calculating gains and losses—have you not heard the words of the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring: *"To cultivate the mind-ground, wholly cast aside worldly affairs; to labor in the teachings, stir up great dust and toil"*? Yet if one lacks the work of the mind-ground *and* fails to labor in the teachings, drifting through days—ask yourself: what manner of person is this?

The Master said: Conditions and causes are fated, not subject to human effort. One must follow nature and await destiny with equanimity. Inner cultivation and outer conduct depend entirely on the self. If one applies effort, one gains merit; whether one acts or not, each reaps their own reward. If the teachings remain closed, one should withdraw and lie low, harmonizing the mind with heaven. When the teachings open, outer conduct must also respond, aligning with heaven and serving others. Merit is not嫌多, nor conduct嫌广—only when the mind is firm and steadfast can accomplishment be achieved.

The Master said: The Dao is present everywhere, manifest in all things. Every form is true; it depends solely on one’s timely application—what else is there? Alas, the human mind is burdened by worldly dust and karmic obstructions, failing to grasp the root. They pluck leaves and seek branches, drift with the waves, and few turn back. Even those who delve deeply do not seek truth, fabricating illusions, seeing spirits and ghosts, piling heads upon heads, turning back and forth in confusion. They do not awaken to the impermanence of the illusory body, the fleeting nature of time. When a single breath does not return—what then?

The Master said: In daily life, let the mind be free of杂念, the intent not wander outward. Release without dissipation, restrain without constraint. Illuminate the mind and recognize the dharma, abandoning cunning and departing from emptiness. In all twelve hours, let each thought arise in the present. If one clings to the present, this is not the principle; if one departs from the present, there is no such place. Harmonizing movement and stillness, knowing going and coming, letting go of all things without entanglement or obstruction—this is a person of carefree ease. Yet words all fall short; one must discern for oneself.

The Master said: Heaven and earth are the parents of the myriad things. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without distinction. How could they favor one thing as good and another as bad? They cover and bear, illuminate and nourish equally. Thus, those in high positions are placed there by the mandate of heaven and should emulate heaven’s all-covering care, nurturing and cherishing all those below, making no distinctions of high and low. Those below are likewise ordained by heaven’s mandate and should emulate earth’s bearing of heaven, respecting and obeying those above without the slightest negligence. Dwelling between heaven and earth, one must accord with their Dao—otherwise, acting beyond one’s station invites misfortune, calamity, and punishment.

The Master said: The cultivator who remains unblemished in their original lineage, applies intention to conduct, swiftly passes through external phenomena, does not cling to human affairs, does not entertain wayward thoughts, establishes not even the slightest trace, and remains unstained by the tiniest speck—radiant, empty, and luminous, neither clinging to emptiness nor existence, neither grasping dharma-appearances nor self-views—who gathers the light of all beings and, over time, mutually sustains and harmonizes inner and outer, attains the station of the sages and worthies. What doubt remains?

The Master said: The cultivator should act or withdraw according to their lot, take or discard as fitting, keep the mind lowly, and take impartiality as their rule. Examine the source of movement and stillness, moderate the use of seeing and hearing, sever all karmic ties, and single-mindedly abide in the true and constant. Thus, through endless kalpas, they remain unchanging and indestructible.

The Master said: The Daoist in daily life embodies heaven and follows earth, ever pure and ever still, luminous yet not obscured. Benefiting beings and aiding life, though mingling amid the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, the true source remains profoundly tranquil, unbroken. Naturally, one escapes the bonds of birth and death—this is the great matter of karmic causes. Alas, the unawakened, lacking inner mastery, are assailed within by desire and tempted without by the senses. Unable to be free, the four kinds of birth revolve, the six paths turn—exchanging their very skin, never to be as they are today.

The Master said: Those who pursue the Dao embrace simplicity and contain purity, subtly penetrating and silently moving. They eliminate passion and abandon desire, diminishing and preserving, acting without selfishness, conducting affairs with clarity, yielding to others, cultivating benevolence and accumulating virtue. The slightest fault they remove; the most minute merit they accumulate. Right and wrong both dissolve; mind and dharma both forgotten. The mechanism of the highest truth naturally becomes clear.

The Master said: When one first leaves the household life to cultivate the Way, it is fundamentally for this great matter of nature and destiny. Yet as the years pass unnoticed, one is swayed by external things, learning instead mere verbal tricks and a hundred kinds of skills—nothing more than the work of servants and maids. How can this be known? For all such arts and crafts must be displayed before others. Is this not being enslaved by others? How can it be the work of one who abides in pure non-action? Thus it is said: “The wise are not used by their wisdom, but the foolish use it; the skillful are not employed by their skill, but the clumsy employ it.” For example, the eloquent speak while the silent listen. Examine this carefully: which is hurried, and which is at ease? Those who wish to cultivate the Way must first clarify their mind-ground and then guard simplicity and clumsiness. Then all the wise and skillful under heaven will be at their service.

The Master said: The essential subtleties transmitted by the true teachers of the highest Way accord secretly with the will of Heaven in all their actions. How can one cling to a single aspect and call it the Dao? Observing their traces, the ancient ones each applied themselves differently, yet the wondrous source of their spiritual origin was never at variance. It is like the functioning of the human mind: in the eyes it sees, in the ears it hears, in the mouth it speaks, in the mind it thinks, in the hands it grasps, in the feet it walks. Though its functions differ, the essence of the mind remains unchanged. Moreover, the secret instructions of the true teachers—what is called “a special transmission outside the teachings”—transcend words and thoughts. Those who awaken attain it for themselves; this is the wondrous subtlety of the true teacher’s secret transmission.

The Master said: My Dao is secretly transmitted. It cannot be sought with intention, nor attained without intention. It is known through not-knowing, attained through not-attaining. The deluded of this world seek the Dao through attire, through speech, through demeanor, through dharma-forms—none grasp its great completeness. They do not realize that the Dao leaves no traces; to seek it through traces is not the Dao. Further, investigate: from whence do these traces arise? Knowing their origin, one finds that what abides within is beyond sound and form, beyond fabrication, beyond demeanor, beyond dharma-forms. It cannot be known by knowing, nor recognized by recognition. It is simply this: the original perfection, truly real, uniting with Heaven and Earth, with sages and worthies, with spirits and ghosts, with the myriad things. How could the dusty traces of voice-hearers ever perceive it? As the Perfected One of Danyang said: “True joy, true leisure—beyond all discussion. Most subtle, most wondrous—beyond all deliberation.” Where there is no deliberation, one draws near.

The Master said: Those who leave the household life and dwell long in the monastic community, receiving instruction and discipline morning and evening, may still grow negligent, procrastinate, and fail to advance. Their resolve for the Dao weakens day by day, while worldly affairs increase. Reckless and unrestrained, they cannot abide in emptiness and stillness. How much more so for those who remain in the world, solitary and independent, their worldly passions lingering, entangled in objects of desire? Obstacles to the Dao arise at every turn, yet they remain unaware. Even if they encounter sages and worthies, they cannot be transformed. With a hundred deceptions, they delude the marketplace, gradually sinking into perdition. Their blessings diminish while their karma grows, their transgressions deepening day by day. If they would but turn their heads, they might still be saved. But if they cling to the dust and turn from the Dao, there is nothing to be done—hell is not far off.

The Master said: Those who study the Dao should never weary of inquiry and questioning. It is like one traveling a road: by asking diligently, one does not go astray. Even in worldly skills, without a teacher one cannot succeed. How much more so with this great Dao, which cannot be seen or heard? Without encountering a teacher at the outset, by what means could one awaken? Of all sufferings, none is greater than birth and death. Without drawing near to a perfected one, how can one escape? Thus it is said: “The ancients did not study the Dao lightly; they served true teachers until old age.” If one does not know where to begin, nor draws near to those who have attained, then even with resolve and practice, a thousand errors and ten thousand mistakes will arise.

The Master said: Those who study the Dao from the beginning must discipline themselves for the benefit of others, silently accumulating merit and conduct. If one indulges the mind and acts without principle, not only does one disgrace the teaching, but one also brings misfortune upon oneself. To serve the body and mouth without purity or frugality, no different from the worldly—such a one consumes the sweat and blood of the ten directions, and this is no small matter. What is enjoyed in ease must be repaid in suffering. When birth and death arrive at last, there will be no escape. Since you dwell within this gate, why not refine the mind?

Someone asked: What is the meaning of a cultivator of the Way remaining sleepless through the night?
The Master replied: The cultivator does not sleep in order to refine the mind. If the mind is not gathered in, what is accomplished? Consider those who gamble, play chess, weave, spin, or grind—those who stay awake all night—are they all people who have attained the Dao? Such people, in all twelve hours of the day, are lured by the mind of profit. They are merely greedy for wealth, their minds agitated like mosquitoes biting the skin, and so they cannot sleep. The cultivator of the Way is not like this. Sleep is one of the desires. If it is not transformed, it nourishes delusion and ignorance, belonging to the yin realm. It is like one guarding against thieves, sitting upright and waiting—then the thieves retreat of themselves. In refining the mind, one must be vigilant lest it drift away. For this mind has no fixed substance: in yang it is bright, in yin it is dark. When familiar states do not arise, there is non-action and purity. The luminous pearl of nature shines clearly—this is why one remains sleepless day and night.

Someone asked: What is the principle behind cultivators of the Way willingly enduring poverty and cold?
The Master replied: If one merely takes poverty, suffering, hunger, and cold to be correct, then all the destitute and struggling people on the streets would be immortals. The cultivator of the Way takes virtue and the Dao as the mind, purity as the thought, cutting away deceit and falsehood, greed and reckless action—all dispatched in an instant. Forgetting form and self, one does not fix the mind on things outside the body. Thus it is said: “This skin covering the flesh—what better or worse is there to choose?”

Filling the belly with food—what need to choose between fine and coarse?” One investigates birth and death and takes the refinement of the heart as one’s task, thus paying no heed to the suffering of the body.

Someone asked: Are there still future retributions of sin and blessing?
The Master replied: Let us not speak of the future; consider only the present. When you set your mind to it and wish to burn incense and bow before the sacred, taking the incense in hand, your heart forms a vow: “May my family be safe, may fortune and longevity increase.” This is not the mind that performs good, yet you expect to receive blessing—even if you do receive it, you will not know. For those who cultivate goodness, the cultivation is clear but the recompense is hidden, and thus there is never one who knows. If you conceive an evil thought and take up a knife to kill, the moment this mind arises, you must repay with your life. This cannot be done openly in a place of perfect justice; one waits for the obscure and unfathomable moment to commit the deed, yet before long it is exposed, and you must repay with your life. This is not hoping for sin and receiving sin—this sin is clearly known. For those who do evil, the act is hidden but the retribution is manifest. These are the evident matters of human action; how much more does Heaven observe what people do not know? Where can one flee? One cannot but be cautious.

Someone asked: Heaven and hell have long been spoken of—are they real?
The Master replied: Heaven is the yang realm, governing goodness and blessing; hell is the yin realm, governing evil and misfortune. The ancients established teachings: heaven and hell arise from the human heart. The conduct of the heart responds obscurely. If one is constantly pure and still, benefiting all, practicing all goodness with clarity and without delusion, one belongs to the yang realm. If one commits all manner of evil, scheming and entrapping, following perverse paths, one belongs to the yin realm—ignorance and darkness grow in turn, and filth and defilement all enter the black register. Neither humans nor spirits tolerate it; the sovereign of the heart is vexed, myriad sufferings press in, and no one comes to the rescue—this is hell. As the ancients said: “A clear heart and tranquil mind are the path to heaven; a confused heart and disordered mind are the gate to hell.” It is like a mountain path where one hears rumors of bandits lying in wait to rob and kill travelers. If you believe it and retreat, you will avoid harm; if you do not believe it and proceed drunkenly, should there be no trouble, all is well—but if bandits truly lie in wait, you fall into their trap, and repentance comes too late. The teaching of hell is of this same principle. Generally, doing evil is not like doing good. Even if good brings no reward, what fault is there? Forcing one’s way in evil paths brings calamity. If one does not repent even when the truth is clear before one’s eyes, how can one foresee the hidden and obscure?

Someone asked: It is said that the supreme matter is complete in every person—why refine it further?
The Master replied: The ordinary mind, unrefined, is like white gold within ore—before smelting, it is but a stubborn stone. Placed in the great furnace, impurities are burned away, and the true substance is separated. Once it becomes gold, it is no longer ore. The cultivator is likewise: taking the mind, long obscured and stained, as crude ore, using resolve as the great furnace and wisdom as the smith, diligently refining it until not a trace remains, one smelts forth one’s own originally unimpeded true heart. Once it is true, it is no longer false. One must protect it, guard it firmly, and store it away, thus enjoying its use—this is the priceless, eternally luminous pearl of antiquity.

Someone asked: When one reaches the state of purity and non-action, has one penetrated through?
The Master replied: Speaking in terms of substance, this seems so but is not. As for the true matter, it cannot be spoken, cannot be thought, cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing. Only when subtlety transcends names and words does it begin to correspond. It neither adheres to movement nor stillness nor departs from them—how can it be fixed as non-action and purity?

Someone asked: I once heard that Master Danyang attained the Dao swiftly by awakening to death—what is the meaning of this?
The Master replied: The cultivator should regard this body as a condemned prisoner being dragged to the execution ground, each step bringing one closer to death. Taking death as one’s thought, one abandons all things. Though sounds, sights, and splendid surroundings encircle one, the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, every thought is forgotten, and even this body is relinquished—how much more all else? Refining the heart in this way, one sees swift attainment, gaining life within death, neither born nor dying. Those newly entering the Dao, seeking to escape birth and death, should hold this thought. Human life is but a moment; if a single breath does not come, one is in the realm of death. Apply the mind urgently, cultivate diligently, dispel the ordinary mind, benefit oneself and others, and rescue one another in turn. One cannot be negligent.

Someone asked: If the heart is without defilement and one roams freely, following conditions, does this accord with the Dao?
The Master replied: To set the mind on being without attachment is to be attached; to have a mind without defilement is to be attached to non-defilement. The moment one desires stillness and concentration, one has already fallen into the root of intention. Following conditions and relying on others still becomes a perverse view. Being without defilement and without attachment are both medicine. When there is no illness, the medicine is removed; if the illness departs but the medicine remains, it ultimately becomes a medicinal illness. Only when the paths of speech and thought are cut off does one arrive home. There is no longer any need to ask about the journey.

The Master said: The Dao cannot be spoken of; one can only point to good and evil. Goodness completes the supreme, world-transcending cause—there is heaven and no hell. Evil leads to falling into boundless suffering—there is hell and no heaven. These two paths arise from delusion and awakening. In awakening, one becomes a sage in an instant; in delusion, one sinks for endless kalpas. Having fortunately obtained a human body, how can one not reflect?

The Master said: The paths of the ordinary and the sage are the same; it is only a matter of clarity and obscurity. In clarity, one is a sage; in obscurity, one is ordinary. The heart of the ordinary person is unwilling to carve away emotions and relinquish attachments, to abandon falsity and remove perversity. Drifting with circumstances, turning with passions, seeking momentary pleasure, one accumulates eons of calamity—unaware, unthinking, unenlightened, unawakened.

The Master said: Those who cultivate the Way must first clarify their own fundamental teaching, then thoroughly understand transformative instruction. If the fundamental teaching is not understood, it is like a person without eyes—unable to distinguish the path, each step erring and faltering. If transformative instruction is not clear, it is like a person with eyes sitting in darkness, then falling into partiality and self-view. One must master both to respond with perfect completeness. If neither is mastered, it is like sitting in great darkness while also being eyeless—when will one ever emerge?

Someone asked: Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir—what does this mean?
The Master replied: The original true nature is precisely this. As it is swift, sharp, firm, and luminous, transforming and melting all, it is called "gold." Having undergone refinement and tempering, perfectly complete and indestructible for ten thousand kalpas, it is named "elixir." Its substance is like empty space, inwardly and outwardly radiant and translucent, not clinging to the slightest thread, unstained by a single speck of dust, shining brilliantly, illuminating and responding without limit. Thus, the ancestral master said:
*"The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir,
The four temporal conditions are the furnace that refines it into a sphere.
Unstained and thought-free, delusions dispelled,
Naturally it rolls forth to ascend the immortal’s altar."*

People of the world who speak of the Golden Elixir as something fabricated in form, tied to passions and desires, hold views of hell—these are the deeds of the lewd and deviant. Such views deviate from the human Dao and lead one into the realm of beasts.

The Master said: Those who study the Dao, in the place where they are untouched by the myriad affairs, unstained by the dust of the senses, and in communion with heaven and earth—here they must thoroughly investigate and penetrate. Then, *"Before heaven, heaven does not oppose it; after heaven, it follows heaven’s timing. If even heaven does not oppose it, how much less do humans? How much less do ghosts and spirits?"*

Someone asked, *"What is the mysterious and wondrous?"*
The answer came: *"Who taught you to ask this?"*
The questioner clasped his hands and said, *"This disciple conceived it himself."*
The answer came: *"If so, then you already understand."*
The questioner laughed and bowed in reverence.

Someone asked, *"The past is not to be pursued, the future not to be anticipated—what of the present?"*
The answer came: *"Extinguish movement but not illumination. Yet you must further comprehend: who is it that extinguishes movement? Once attained, the power rests in your hands—whether to extinguish or not is yours to decide."*

Someone asked, *"I do not ask of the past or future mind—what is the present mind?"*
The Master looked straight ahead and said, *"This is not the present."*
Then he lowered his head and said, *"This is not the present."*
Turning back, he asked, *"Do you understand?"*
The questioner laughed and said, *"I do not."*
The Master replied, *"With eyes wide open, you fail to grasp even the present—how then speak of past or future?"*

Someone asked, *"What are fortune and misfortune?"*
The answer came: *"Piling wood makes a forest; piling stones makes a mountain; piling water makes a sea. Piling goodness makes fortune; piling evil makes misfortune. The source of fortune and misfortune lies in the mind alone—only through accumulation do they take form. Can one not be cautious?"*

Someone asked, *"What are good and evil?"*
The answer came: *"Every kind thought is good; every unbalanced thought is evil. The goodness unknown to others is the greatest good; the evil unknown to others is the greatest evil. Yet where neither good nor evil is contemplated, there lies something beyond."*

Someone asked, *"Ordinary people fall ill, and Daoists fall ill—what is the difference?"*
The answer came: *"Long ago, Master Danyang fell ill, yet physicians could not read his pulse. Master Huqiu sat in stillness, yet diviners could not discern his truth. Why? When the mind is not bound to things, creation cannot alter it; when nature does not stray from its source, even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it—how much less the common arts of medicine or divination? This is how it differs from ordinary people."*

The Master said: *"Those who cultivate the Dao yet fail to open their true eye or awaken their perfect mechanism merely chase after others’ footprints, measuring words and phrases—all in vain. It is like a blind man hearing others speak of the sun and moon’s light yet never seeing it himself, only imagining. This is because he has not worked upon his own mind."*

Someone asked, *"In the midst of movement and stillness, how can one be thus?"*
The answer came: *"When the mind is pure and still, even amid bustling crowds and clamorous markets, if it concerns not oneself, let the world clamor—it is no different from an empty chamber where nothing exists. Yet if in a secluded cell, far from others, one stands as if in a crossroads marketplace, facing the sacred and true without daring to entertain the slightest delusion—then neither movement nor stillness hinders. What further confusion could arise?"*

Someone asked, *"If one harmonizes with the world yet remains unattached to things, how is this so?"*
The answer came: *"Heaven is heaven, earth is earth, mountains are mountains, waters are waters, things are things, and I am I. Though mingling with all, how can they truly attach?"*

Someone asked, *"All forms and shapes differ—how can they be seen as one?"*
The answer came: *"Heaven is the Dao, earth is the Dao, the myriad things are the Dao. That is the Dao, this is the Dao. Though forms vary, the Dao is everywhere present—how can they not be one?"*

Someone asked, *"People seek joy, yet Daoists embrace hardship—why?"*
The answer came: *"Worldly people know not true joy. They take what pleases the heart as joy, yet desire leads them into suffering, mistaking it for joy. Daily, they scheme and calculate, seeking worldly pleasures. When unfulfilled, they are beset by sorrow and disturbance, their spirits never at ease—this is the greatest suffering. Those who study the Dao do not seek worldly joy. Their minds abide in the great Dao, encountering hardship without suffering. Without suffering, there is constant joy, and the heart attains freedom. Where there is joy, there is suffering; without joy, there is no suffering. A mind free of both joy and suffering—this is true joy."*

Someone asked, *"How can one transcend the causes of sin and fortune?"*
The answer came: *"Sin and fortune belong to the shell of yin and yang. If you step beyond this shell, then there is no sin or fortune. What is the shell of yin and yang? Whenever the slightest selfish, perverse, covetous, or malevolent thought arises in the mind, it belongs to the yin shell. Even the slightest good thought belongs to the yang shell. Within yin, there is retribution for evil; within yang, there is reward for good. But if one has refined the mind until it is like empty space—neither good nor evil, without the slightest entanglement, and master of oneself—then fortune and misfortune cannot touch them, and cause and effect cannot sway them. This is one who has stepped beyond the shell of yin and yang. Laypeople, never harboring a single good thought, spend their days scheming for wealth and profit, living at others’ expense, deceiving and entrapping—all is a single mass of dark, ignorant karma. They remain trapped within the shell of yin and yang, unable even to tread the yang path—how then could they step beyond it? If you seek to be free of sin and fortune, free of cause and effect, is it not difficult? You have forged this yourself—how can you escape?"*

Thus, bow your head and close your eyes—let Old Yan* attend to it.

Someone asked: What truly becomes of the matter of future rebirth?
The answer: A human life, shaped by its own passions, forges the mold for its next existence. Those who do good create a mold of goodness; those who do evil create a mold of evil. When this karmic body is spent and the one nature departs this shell, it is like iron smelted into molten gold—poured by the Creator into the self-made mold, becoming human or beast, each reaping what it has sown. Does the Creator intend for you to become a beast? Does it intend for you to enter the Six Paths? No—it is the shell you have forged in this life that traps you, inescapably. Where this nature goes, so follows its form: the cruel become serpents, the miserly become dogs, the lustful and murderous become swine, the greedy and violent become wolves—all generally follow this pattern. Between heaven and earth, the myriad forms and shapes are beyond enumeration, each self-made and self-endured. Thus the ancients said: *"Associate with metal and stone, and you become metal and stone; associate with water and fire, and you become water and fire."* Their words are true. In an instant, one loses the human form, and for ten thousand kalpas it is not regained. Why not reflect on this?

Someone asked: I am now old and cannot study much—pray, Master, speak a word of the utmost mystery and wonder.
The answer: Cast aside your search for the utmost mystery and wonder, and that is it.

Someone asked: The teachings of the world each claim their own truth, distinguishing right from wrong, orthodoxy from heterodoxy—how can one know which is true?
The answer: There are two paths: one of cultivation, and one of worldly engagement. Those who cultivate make this mind as clear and still as heaven and earth, as bright as the sun and moon, as ceaselessly transforming as the four seasons. They respond to affairs yet return to their root—ask not what lies beyond, for this is the very functioning of the true Dao. Only those who cultivate can achieve this. As for those who recite scriptures with their lips, adorn the Dharma-body with fine trappings, and present themselves as pleasing figures to win others’ admiration—these are but the branches, flowers, and leaves of the teaching, used for worldly engagement. What do they have to do with cultivation? What do they have to do with the true Dao? They are but temporary expedients. Moreover, if their hearts are filled with strife—over self and others, wealth and profit—no different from the common folk, how can they claim to represent the true teaching? Let those with clear eyes see this.
