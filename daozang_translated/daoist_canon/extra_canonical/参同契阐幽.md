**Preface to *The Kinship of the Three Elucidating the Obscure***

*By Zhu Yuanyu of the Qing Dynasty*

The Great Dao is fundamentally beyond words and names, beyond forms and appearances. Vast and undifferentiated, none know its beginning. Yet without borrowing words and names to express it, the Dao would never be revealed. In ancient times, Fuxi’s *Book of Changes* directly pointed to Qian and Kun, while Laozi’s *Classic* fully expounded the Dao and its virtue. Through these two sages, the primordial chaos was pierced, and the root of life and nature within each person found its place. Thus, the Great Dao became luminous!

These two works sprang from the same source, but later, alas, they diverged into the Confucian and Daoist schools. Those who followed the *Changes* became petty scholars of images and numbers, while those who adhered to the Daoist path became longevity-seeking alchemists. The study of returning to the root and restoring life nearly vanished. Who could unite and penetrate both? Only *The Kinship of the Three*!

This text emerged in the Han dynasty, where the patriarch Wei Boyang employed the trigrams and hexagrams to reveal the root of nature and life. Nature is the primordial spirit, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas; life is the primordial qi of the Void, the original essence of utmost purity. Grasping one implies two, lifting two implies three, and uniting three returns to the One. Thus, when speaking of spirit, essence and qi are present. Essence and qi are not coarse; when speaking of essence and qi, spirit is present, yet spirit is not essence. When speaking of nature, life abides; life is not mired in existence. When speaking of life, nature abides; nature is not lost in nothingness. These two words alone contain the true teaching—they may be divided or united, expanded or gathered.

In the *Changes of Fuxi*, Qian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams; in Laozi’s *Classic*, the Dao and virtue are the master of all phenomena. Later masters and schools, in all their varied discourses, never strayed beyond the scope of these two words. Following them forward is called "Heaven’s mandate is nature"; reversing them is called "Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach life." The grand Dao converges in the three teachings, and the thousand sages share a single destination. All else is but side paths and winding trails.

This method of reversal and return is not inherently complex. The author, out of compassion, would surely wish to point directly to the truth. Yet fearing that those who understand would be few and unable to bear its clarity, he had no choice but to craft words from the wordless and establish names and images from the nameless and imageless. With painstaking effort, he concealed the mother and spoke of the child, weaving the two-word truth into seven scrolls.

Thus, he divided governance, nurturing nature, and dietary refinement into three gates, and further separated medicinal substances, the crucible, and the firing times into three schools. Within each gate lie three gates, and within each school lie three schools. Through threefold interpenetration, the ninefold transformation is complete—this is the meaning of *kinship* in *The Kinship of the Three*.

Only through *participation* do the proper alignments of nature and life become visible; only through *unity* does their non-duality appear; only through *harmony* is the essential return of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching life revealed. Within the seven scrolls, there is constant division and union, expansion and gathering—roughly, the earlier sections emphasize division and expansion, while the later ones emphasize union and gathering. Interwoven and ever-changing, the text naturally forms its structure—this is why *The Kinship of the Three* is not easily known or spoken.

Yuanyu, in his youthful years...

In his childhood years, he yearned for the Dao. Initially, he paid homage to Master Zhang Bixu of the Northern School, who pointed out the mysterious pass, allowing him to gain an entry into this book—though he had yet to glimpse its inner sanctum. From then on, he traversed the Five Peaks and visited masters far and wide, yet few could dispel his accumulated doubts. Finally, deep within Zhongnan, he was fortunate to meet the Elder of Lingbao, who unlocked the *Yi* within his heart, revealing all within and without with perfect clarity. Only then did he realize that a single grain could contain the world and a mote of dust could turn the Dharma-wheel—these were no empty words. Yet the subtleties of this higher mechanism cannot be lightly discussed.

He still recalled the parting exhortation of the Elder at their crossroads, urging him to broadly ferry others across so the lineage would not be severed, for the karmic conditions lay mostly south of the great river. Thereafter, he packed his belongings and journeyed south, entering the circle to cultivate the Dao. Relying on the strenuous support of fellow practitioners in Piling, he roughly resolved the great matter. In the *dingyou* year, he brought his disciple Pan Jingguan to Huayang to practice quietude and peruse the Daoist Canon. Casually drawing out a volume of the *Kinship of the Three*, he read it several times with delight, like a pauper discovering a treasure trove, overjoyed beyond measure.

All his life, he had privately reflected that this book’s origins ran deepest, serving as the primal ancestor of alchemical classics and the lifeblood of all perfected ones. When the Patriarch Wei personally transmitted this book to Xu, the Attendant of Qingzhou, Xu concealed his name and wrote a commentary on it—now lost to time. Later commentators proliferated, many misconstruing its meaning. Some even led it astray into the forge-fires of heterodox schools, further obscuring the Patriarch’s intent.

Yu, deeply moved by this, resolved to lift its obscurity. Thus, he secluded himself for winter retreat. Each day, he recited one or two chapters of the original text, exploring its profound meaning with his disciple Pan, who recorded their insights. In the stillness of deep mountains and quiet nights, they sat by lamplight around the hearth, delving into the text’s innermost secrets. When understanding eluded them, even spirits seemed to offer guidance, until at last, clarity dawned in a sudden breakthrough. After eighty dawns and dusks, the draft was complete. He titled it *Unveiling the Obscure*, declaring: "This book, long buried in the ninefold depths of earth, now ascends to the ninefold heavens above; long submerged in the dark valley, it now bathes in the radiance of the Salty Pond." After finishing the draft, he and Pan revised it several times, stripping away all superficial layers to preserve only the truth, like a secret treasure hidden beneath one’s pillow.

In the *dingwei* year, Xu Jingdu petitioned for its circulation, making it available to fellow seekers. Zhang Jingjian assisted in this endeavor. Thus, craftsmen were commissioned, and patrons eagerly responded, bringing the seven fascicles to completion in sequence. They requested a preface from me, so I briefly recount what I received from my teacher, offering it for the scrutiny of those well-versed in the Dao.

I also wish that readers of this book will not cling to mere words or rigid concepts. Seek understanding only from within its teachings: first, to encompass the transformations of creation, and then to shatter the emptiness of the void. What need is there to dissect governance, nurturing life, or the ingestion of elixirs? What need to distinguish between medicinal substances, crucibles, or the timing of the fire? Even the duality of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (destiny) need not be established. If one grasps it thus, it may suffice to repay the kindness of Patriarch Wei, Master Xu, and all the ancestral masters above them; it may suffice to repay the kindness of Fuxi, Laozi, and all the sages above them. And the gratitude for all beings—sentient and insentient, the mountains and rivers, the earth, and all creatures—will likewise be repaid. The Dao is equal in all things, manifesting in every particular. One will see that both the sentient and insentient alike radiate the great treasury of luminosity, dispelling darkness and illuminating the obscure. From this, I too shall remain silent, utterly forgetful of words.

Respectfully composed on the first day of the second lunar month in the *jiyou* year of the Kangxi reign by Zhu Yuanyu, disciple of the Longmen lineage of the Northern School.

*The Kinship of the Three* by the Perfected Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han.
*Unveiling the Obscure* by the Cloud Yang Daoist Zhu Yuanyu.

*The Kinship of the Three* was composed by the Perfected Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han, using the principles of the *Yijing* to elucidate the Dao of alchemy. The essence of the *Yijing*’s Dao lies in nothing beyond the interplay of yin and yang, and the application of the alchemical Dao likewise lies in nothing beyond the interplay of yin and yang. When yin and yang unite, they form the *Yijing*, and the Great Dao resides therein.

*Can* (參) refers to the interweaving of the three; *tong* (同) means convergence; *qi* (契) signifies mutual resonance. The text is divided into three chapters—upper, middle, and lower—each encompassing the three schools of governance, nurturing life, and ingesting elixirs. Only by interweaving these three schools, merging the *Yijing*’s nature and emotions, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s nurturing of life, and the crucible’s workings into one, does one resonate with the Great Dao of fulfilling nature and destiny. To grasp one aspect is to possess all three. The final fascicle’s "Three Resemblances" clarifies this principle.

**Upper Chapter (First Fascicle: On Governance, comprising five sections—this is the upper portion of the upper chapter)**
This fascicle focuses on governance, with the nurturing of life and ingestion of elixirs already implicit within it. The so-called "governance" presents the symbolic forms of *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li*, subtly embodying the hierarchical structure of ruler and minister. The ruler governs through non-action, while the minister acts—this is the principle underlying both the nurturing of life and the ingestion of elixirs. Thus, the final fascicle also refers to the *Yijing*’s emotions and nature.

**Chapter One: The Gate of Qian and Kun**
*Qian* and *kun* are the gates of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams. *Kan* and *li* form their framework, turning the hub and aligning the axle. The four trigrams of the *pin* and *mu* serve as the bellows. Enveloping the Dao of yin and yang, they resemble a craftsman wielding the inked cord, holding the reins, aligning the compass and square, and following the tracks. Ruling from the center to govern the exterior, their numbers are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendars. The lunar phases consist of five and six, weaving the warp and weft at the sun’s command. Combined, they form sixty, with hardness and softness manifesting both internally and externally. At dawn, *zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *meng* assumes its duty. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, applied in sequence. Before reaching the end of the month, the cycle concludes and begins anew. The sun and moon set the measure, their movements and stillness varying in timing. Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. Autumn and winter engage the outer function, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Rewards and punishments align with spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow cold and heat. The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, they harmonize with the four seasons, and the five phases attain their principle.

This chapter first presents *qian* and *kun* as the gates encompassing all transformations, serving as the guiding principle of the entire text.

*Qian* and *kun* are the gates of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams. *Kan* and *li* form their framework, turning the hub and aligning the axle.
This passage speaks of the Dao of yin and yang as nothing beyond the scope of *qian* and *kun*. In the realm of heaven and earth, this single body of yin and yang is called the Dao; its transformative mechanism is called the *Yijing*; its numinous application is called the elixir. The *Yijing*’s yin and yang do not extend beyond *qian* and *kun*; the alchemical Dao’s yin and yang do not extend beyond *xing* (nature) and *ming* (destiny). *Qian* and *kun* are *xing* and *ming*. Yet one must thoroughly investigate the workings prior to their emergence to understand that heaven and earth originate from this, and human life begins from this. The alchemical Dao is founded upon this.

Originally, before the primal chaos, when the single *qi* had yet to manifest, it could neither be spoken of nor named. Vast and empty, without form or boundary, this is called true emptiness. Yet within emptiness, there is non-emptiness—this is called wondrous existence. Only by recognizing existence within emptiness can the beginningless beginning be forcibly named the origin of heaven and earth. Only by recognizing emptiness within existence can the beginning of existence be forcibly named the mother of the myriad things. Existence within emptiness is the Supreme Ultimate without the Ultimateless; emptiness within existence is the Ultimateless within the Supreme Ultimate. The essence of the Supreme Ultimate is originally neither movement nor stillness. Movement without movement is why *qian* constitutes heaven, and the light and pure have their root.

Stillness without stillness—this is why *kun* constitutes earth, and the heavy and turbid have their foundation.

Between one movement and one stillness lies humanity as the heart of heaven and earth, wherein the ceaseless generation of the *Yi* resides. Though the embryo is formed, primal chaos remains undivided; thus it is said the Supreme Ultimate contains the Three.

When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, *qian*’s solitary yang pierces straight through the nine depths of earth, and *kun* receives it. Within yin, yang is enfolded—solidified, it becomes *kan*, and this is called “Heaven One generates Water.” In the earth it is water; in the heavens it is the moon.

When movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns, *kun*’s solitary yin ascends straight to the nine heavens above, and *qian* governs it. Within yang, yin is contained—ruptured, it becomes *li*, and this is called “Earth Two generates Fire.” In the world it is fire; in the heavens it is the sun.

Thus from the Supreme Ultimate arise the Two Modes, and from the Two Modes arise the Four Images. Heaven and earth are not revealed without sun and moon; *qian* and *kun* do not circulate without *kan* and *li*. Therefore, in the Dao of the *Yi*, *qian* and *kun* serve as the body, while *kan* and *li* serve as the function.

Why is this so? As a thing, *qian* is concentrated in stillness and direct in movement. All sixty-four hexagrams’ yang lines enter and exit through *qian*’s gate, yet ultimately they are but the original solitary yang. As a thing, *kun* is contracted in stillness and expanded in movement; all sixty-four hexagrams’ yin lines open and close through *kun*’s portal, yet ultimately they are but the original solitary yin. One yin and one yang—this is called the true *Yi*.

*Qian*, knowing the great beginning, is truly the father of all yang, thus the Dao of *qian* completes the male, manifesting as *zhen*, *kan*, and *gen*. *Kun*, forming things, is truly the mother of all yin, thus the Dao of *kun* completes the female, manifesting as *xun*, *li*, and *dui*. From this interchange and transformation, generation ceaselessly arises, layering into sixty-four hexagrams and branching into four thousand ninety-six. Is this not what is meant by “*Qian* and *kun* are the gates of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams”?

Why, then, among the Six Children, are only *kan* and *li* employed? Because *zhen*, *xun*, *gen*, and *dui* each receive a partial aspect of *qian* and *kun*, while *kan* and *li* alone receive their true essence. In the primordial arrangement, *qian* is positioned in the south and *kun* in the north; only by exchanging their central lines do *kan* and *li* emerge. In the later arrangement, the hexagrams reverse, placing *li* in the south and *kan* in the north, yet *qian* and *kun* still envelop them externally, the framework of heaven and earth remaining unmoved, while *kan* and *li*—the sun and moon—naturally revolve within.

In the small, this is day and night, waxing and waning; in the greater, it is the seasons of spring and autumn, cold and heat; in the greatest, it is the epochs of cosmic cycles. It is like driving a chariot: the hollow center is the hub, and the two turning ends are the axle. The chariot cannot move itself; it relies on the axle at both ends, and the axle, in turn, relies on the hub at the center to rotate. The chariot turns by means of the axle, and the axle revolves by means of the hub—only then is its function complete. Such is the relationship of *kan* and *li* to *qian* and *kun*. Is this not what is meant by “*Kan* and *li* frame the structure, turning the hub and aligning the axle”?

Laozi said: “Thirty spokes share one hub. It is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the chariot lies.” This is what is meant.

This chapter serves as the guiding principle of the entire work, and this passage, in turn, is the guiding principle of the whole chapter. In the alchemical practice of the Dao, the gates of *qian* and *kun* become the furnace and crucible, while the framing of *kan* and *li* becomes the medicinal ingredients; the fire-times emerge from within. The four trigrams of the female and male serve as the bellows and flute. They enwrap the Dao of yin and yang, just as a skilled charioteer follows the marking line, holds the reins and bit, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the external, the calculations are recorded in the pitch-pipes and calendars.

This passage speaks of *qian* and *kun* transforming into *kan* and *li*, thereby enveloping the Dao of yin and yang. *Qian* is originally pure yang, the male. Yet when its middle line transforms to produce *li*’s lesser yin, the male turns into the female. *Kun* is originally pure yin, the female. Yet when its middle line transforms to produce *kan*’s lesser yang, the female turns into the male. When *kun* shifts into *kan*, beneath the ninefold earth, its depths are unfathomable; the qi mechanism moves and ever arises—this is the bottomless bellows. When *qian* shifts into *li*, above the ninefold heavens, a single thread subtly connects; its fundamental nature is empty yet inexhaustible—this is the perforated flute. Laozi said: “Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows and flute?” This is what he meant.

Thus it is said: “The four trigrams of the female and male serve as bellows and flute.” The two *qi* of *kan* and *li* move back and forth, entering and exiting between heaven and earth, so that day and night, darkness and dawn, spring and autumn, cold and heat never deviate by even a hair’s breadth. Though called four trigrams, in truth they are but one *kan* and one *li*. Though called two trigrams, in truth they are *kan* and *li*, with one yin and one yang between them. They encompass the entire body of the sixty-four hexagrams and the full function of their three hundred sixty lines, all enveloped within. Is this not like a skilled charioteer who holds the reins according to the marking cord, aligns the wheels with the compass and square, and follows the tracks? The horse has its bit and bridle; the chariot has its ruts and tracks. The standards are manifest before one, each to be observed and followed. Externally, one holds fast to the standard and aligns with it, yet within there must be the charioteer who governs from the center—precisely the one mentioned above who turns the hub and aligns the axle. The method of governance is neither too swift nor too slow, adapting to every direction and matching every rhythm. A numerical order exists within, which is the measure of the fire’s timing discussed below. The twelve pitch-pipes of the *lü* and the twelve celestial stems of the calendar are nothing but six yin and six yang, circulating and revolving without the slightest deviation. When the fire’s timing and regulation attain this standard, this becomes the guiding principle of the celestial revolution. Thus it is said: “Governing the external from the center, the numbers are recorded in the *lü* and calendar.”

The lunar phases have five and six; warp and weft serve the sun’s command.
Combined they make sixty, with firm and yielding in outer and inner.
At dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* takes up its duty; by dusk, *Meng* receives it.
Day and night each govern one hexagram, used in proper sequence.
Before reaching the last day’s darkness and dawn, the cycle ends and begins anew.

This passage speaks of the waxing and waning, darkness and dawn, measured by the lunar month—the fire’s timing of the lesser celestial revolution. The *Book of Changes* has sixty-four hexagrams; excluding *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, which correspond to the furnace, crucible, and elixir, the remaining sixty hexagrams and their three hundred sixty lines precisely match the degrees of the celestial revolution. The middle lines of *Kan* and *Li* govern one day and one month, grasping *Qian* and *Kun* as they move within the three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees. The guiding principle of the celestial revolution never exceeds this scope. The sun is the great yang; the moon is the great yin. The yang number takes five as its center; the yin number takes six as its center. Doubling six yields the twelve *lü* and celestial stems as their standard. Multiplying five by six gives thirty, the number of a lunar month. As the sun and moon weave their warp and weft, they form the waxing and waning, darkness and dawn. The moon’s waxing and waning, its fullness and emptiness, follow the sun’s revolution, as if receiving its mandate. Thus it is said: “The lunar phases have five and six; warp and weft serve the sun’s command.”

Day and night divide the warp and weft of the sun and moon. Within these thirty days, combined they form sixty hexagrams, from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Jiji* and *Weiji*, with all hexagram images complete. Within each hexagram, the inner and outer bodies are invariably opposed. Opposed forms include *Zhun* and *Meng*, *Xu* and *Song*, and the like; paired forms include *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo*, and the like. Some have firmness on the outside and yielding within, others yielding on the outside and firmness within—*Zhun* and *Meng* serve as examples. In *Zhun*, one yang moves below, resembling dawn; in *Meng*, one yang rests above, resembling dusk. Day and night alternate, yet the two hexagrams are but one. At dawn of the new moon, the cycle begins with *Zhun* and *Meng*, and by the last day of the month, it concludes precisely with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. The sixty hexagrams complete one lunar cycle, then end and begin anew, circulating without end.

The sun and moon set the measure; movement and stillness have their times.
Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.
Autumn and winter engage the outer function, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.
The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in due season.
Thus responding to the four seasons, the five phases attain their principle.

This passage speaks of the two solstices and two equinoxes, measured by the solar year—the fire’s timing of the greater celestial revolution. “The sun and moon set the measure” means the sun governs the day, positioned at high noon. From the first stirring of one yang to the fullness of six yang belongs to the sun’s seasonal *qi*. The moon governs the night, positioned at midnight. From the first stillness of one yin to the fullness of six yin belongs to the moon’s fire timing. “Movement and stillness have their times” means the stirring of one yang and the advance of fire correspond to *Zhun* and occur early; the stillness of one yin and the retreat of fire correspond to *Meng* and occur late. Know that the measure of one day is the measure of one month, and the measure of one month is the measure of one year. Also know that the movement and stillness of one year do not exceed those of one month, and the movement and stillness of one month do not exceed those of one day. These two sentences connect the preceding and following, serving as the guiding principle of the entire passage, which then elaborates on the year’s seasonal timing.

The inner and outer bodies of the hexagrams encompass the four seasons. Take *Zhun*, for example: beginning with the first line, the advance of fire marks the *zi* hour when one yang first stirs. Progressing to the top line, it becomes pure yang at *si*. Moving from the inner body to the outer function, it corresponds to spring and summer. In *Meng*, beginning with the top line, the retreat of fire marks the *wu* hour when one yin first stills. Progressing to the first line, it becomes pure yin at *hai*. Returning from the outer function to the inner body, it corresponds to autumn and winter. This describes the seasonal timing of the winter and summer solstices and their union.

The great yang at *mao* corresponds to the spring equinox, embodying virtue with the image of punishment. The great yin at *you* corresponds to the autumn equinox, embodying punishment with the image of virtue and reward. Thus it is said: “Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn.” The sun rises in *yin* and sets in *shen*; fire is born in *yin*, resembling heat. The moon rises in *shen* and sets in *yin*; water is born in *shen*, resembling cold.

Thus it is said: “Dusk and dawn follow cold and heat.” Benevolence governs expansion, righteousness governs contraction; the lines’ explanations each have their governing principle. This still reflects the image of following cold and heat. Joy inclines toward reward, anger inclines toward punishment. They arise in accordance with the season, never exceeding their proper measure. This still reflects the image of corresponding to spring and autumn. This speaks of the bathing phase of the spring and autumn equinoxes.

In this way, water, fire, wood, and metal each hold to one seasonal qi, and within them the true earth harmonizes and blends. The fully complete qi of creation’s harmony coalesces to form the elixir. Thus it is said: “In this way, they correspond to the four seasons, and the five phases attain their principle.”

The preceding section spoke of the lesser celestial cycle’s firing times corresponding to a month; this section speaks of the greater celestial cycle’s firing times corresponding to a year. One must understand that the operations within are all methods of gathering and concentrating: gathering the year into months, months into days, days into hours. It all comes to rest in a single moment, distinguishing movement and stillness. Within this, the ebb and flow depend entirely on the bellows and key of Kan and Li—what is called “the Dao of covering and veiling yin and yang.”

This chapter uses the images of creation to clarify the functions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. The human body contains a small heaven and earth, and its images are likewise. Qian is the head, the image of father and heaven; Kun is the abdomen, the image of mother and earth. Zhen is the feet, Xun the thighs—near the earthly realm, the images of eldest son and eldest daughter. Gen is the hands, Dui the mouth—near the heavenly realm, the images of youngest son and youngest daughter. Kan is the ears, Li the eyes, moving at the center of heaven and earth, uniquely occupying the human position, the images of middle son and middle daughter. The remaining four limbs and hundred bones, the three hundred sixty joints, the eighty-four thousand pores—these are the scattered distribution of the many hexagrams and lines.

Yet all this is what has form and name, known to all. Who knows that which is formless and nameless? Before father and mother were born, it was perfectly complete, all-pervading, utterly empty, spiritually penetrating, and fundamentally unstained. No cultivation or verification was needed; in emptiness there was non-emptiness, the true master of the void. This is what is called the single Supreme Ultimate in its entirety.

Then a single spark of numinous light came from the Great Void, suddenly sensing and attaching, entering straight into the central palace of the spirit chamber to become the master of the body. This is what is called each possessing a Supreme Ultimate. Once the master resided in the spirit chamber, it connected above to the heavenly hub and below to the sea of qi. Before essence and life were divided, it was still the original, undivided face.

When the central palace’s ebb and flow began to stir, it drew in the qi of the Great Void through the two apertures, passing straight through the heavenly hub and descending to the sea of qi. Qian below joined Kun, and one line within Kun became solid, forming Kan—this was the root of life. Once Kun became Kan, its single yin line followed the heavenly qi upward to the heavenly hub. Kun above joined Qian, and one line within Qian broke, forming Li—this was the root of nature. Then, with a *he* sound, the umbilical cord was cut, and nature and life were divided into the upper and lower arcs.

This is what Lü Zu meant when he said: “Exhaustively seek the moment of receiving qi at birth; marvel not that the celestial mechanism is entirely revealed.” From this point onward, the postnatal takes charge. There are gates and doors, never departing from Qian and Kun, and the bellows’ operation depends entirely on Kan and Li. Kan sinks into the sea of qi, primordial essence deeply hidden in the great abyss, its depths unfathomable beneath the ninefold earth—this is the bellows’ function. Li ascends to the heavenly hub, numinous light penetrating the Great Void, piercing straight to the summit of the nine heavens—this is the key’s function.

The sun emerges, the moon enters; breath comes and goes, precisely at the center of heaven and earth’s eighty-four thousand *li*. One opening and closing divides day and night; one ebb and one rest determines the dark and new moons; one gloom and one ease distinguishes cold and heat; one joy and one anger corresponds to spring and autumn. The four seasons and five phases are all fully present, and creation lies within one’s own body.

Thus, those who study the Dao, if they can open their own gates and doors, may recognize the Qian-Kun furnace and cauldron. If they can operate their own hub and axle, they may gather the Kan-Li medicinal substances. If they can work their own bellows and key, they may practice the sixty hexagrams’ yang fire and yin tally. This is what is meant by: “What follows to give life to humans, when reversed, forms the elixir.”

Chen Xiyi said: The sun is the heavenly qi descending from the west to join the earth; the moon is the earthly qi ascending from the east to join heaven—the image of male and female uniting in essence. Heaven and earth cannot produce cold and heat; cold and heat arise from the sun and moon’s distance. Heaven and earth cannot produce the four seasons; the four seasons arise from the sun and moon’s north and south. Heaven and earth cannot produce day and night; day and night arise from the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Heaven and earth cannot produce the dark and new moons; the dark and new moons arise from the sun and moon’s conjunction. Though yin and yang are subtle, they are not beyond the sun and moon. Though creation is vast, it is not beyond Kan and Li.

Thus, though the changes of the many hexagrams are not uniform, they do not depart from the middle lines of Kan and Li—like a wheel’s thirty spokes sharing a single hub.

**Chapter Two: The Two Uses of Kan and Li**

Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them. Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. “Establish their positions” means arranging the positions of yin and yang in pairing. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two uses of Qian and Kun. These two uses have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids. Their comings and goings are not fixed, nor are their positions above or below constant. Hidden and submerged, they transform within. They enfold the ten thousand things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. Using the formless to govern the formed, the vessel’s use is emptiness.

Thus, in tracing their ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish. Words are not idly made; theories do not arise in vain. They are drawn from verification and effect, measured against the numinous and bright. By analogy and structural composition, the original principles are confirmed.

Kan is the lunar essence of Wu, Li the solar radiance of Ji.
Sun and moon form the *Yi*, hard and soft in mutual balance.
Earth reigns through the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end.
Blue, red, white, and black each dwell in their quadrant,
yet all draw from the Central Palace, the work of Wu and Ji.
This chapter reveals that the two uses of Kan and Li do not depart from the One Center—
it fulfills the opening chapter’s theme of the hub turning the axle.

Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them.
Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun.
“Establishing positions” means arranging the positions of yin and yang in pairing.
The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li.
Kan and Li are the two uses of Qian and Kun.
These two uses have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids.
Their comings and goings are not fixed, nor are their positions above or below constant.
Hidden and submerged, they transform within.
They enfold the ten thousand things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.
This passage speaks of the wondrous workings of Kan and Li as residing within the fixed positions of Qian and Kun.

In the *Yi*, they are Qian and Kun; their modeled images are Heaven and Earth.
In the *Yi*, they are Kan and Li; their modeled images are sun and moon.
These are the postcelestial Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—formed and named.
Before Heaven and Earth, sun and moon existed, there was only the undifferentiated Great Void.
Within this Great Void, originally nothing existed—round, luminous, and vast—this was the precosmic Qian.
Within it, a thing formed in undifferentiated wholeness, pervading and filling all—this was the precosmic Kun.
From the Void, qi arose as the utmost yang qi, and within this utmost yang lay the reverent, utmost yin.
This ascends from Kun.
The Void contains Being—this is Li within Qian.
Qi congeals into essence as the utmost yin essence, and within this utmost yin lies the blazing, utmost yang.
This descends from Qian.
Being contains the Void—this is Kan within Kun.
One ascends, one descends; the pivot lies entirely in the center.
When the pivot moves, Heaven and Earth divide.
Once Heaven and Earth divide, their positions are fixed.
Naturally, Heaven takes its place above, Earth below;
the sun emerges in the east, the moon arises in the west.
Thus, in Fu Xi’s precosmic round diagram, the Qian trigram resides in the south, the Kun trigram in the north—
Heaven above, Earth below, encompassing all images.
This is the fixing of Heaven and Earth’s positions.
The Li trigram resides in the east, the Kan trigram in the west—
sun and moon face each other, traversing the center of Heaven and Earth.
Water and fire do not oppose each other.
Yet only after the bodies of Heaven and Earth are established do the functions of sun and moon operate.
Thus, the *Xici Zhuan* states: “Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them.”
This is a direct pointer.
Master Wei feared that later generations would not know what Heaven and Earth are, nor what the *Yi* is,
so he added this annotation:
Heaven and Earth are not the external images of Heaven and Earth, but rather the natural, spiritually empty images of the one Qian and one Kun—
the “gate and door” referred to in the previous chapter.
“Establishing positions” does not mean physical positions, but rather the natural pairing of one yin and one yang—
the “vast expanse” mentioned in the previous chapter.
The *Yi* is not the *Yi* of trigrams and lines, but rather the natural movement of the one Kan and one Li, the true breath coming and going—
the “bellows” referred to in the previous chapter.
Are not the transformations of Heaven and Earth the very transformations of our own bodies?

What is meant by “Kan and Li are the two uses of Qian and Kun”?
Qian is originally old yang, but its center transforms into young yin.
The one yin within Li is the true essence of Kun’s origin.
Thus, Li turns from east to south.
The precosmic Qian position becomes the postcosmic Li, turning one into nine, making the head the tail.
Thus, the line statement bears the image of “having no head.”
Qian’s “use of nine” is the use of Li.
Kun is originally old yin, but its center transforms into young yang.
The one yang within Kan is the ancestral qi of Qian’s origin.
Thus, Kan turns from west to north.
The precosmic Kun position becomes the postcosmic Kan, turning six into one, making the end the beginning.
Thus, the line statement bears the auspiciousness of “eternal steadfastness.”
Kun’s “use of six” is the use of Kan.
This mutual concealment of sun and moon is why they are the ancestral origin of the *Yi*—
the wondrous workings of true water and true fire interacting.
Sun and moon, from ancient times to eternity, rise and set within the Great Void,
moving above, below, and all around—nowhere they do not operate.
Just as in one hexagram, the six lines each have their fixed positions,
yet the two uses of Kan and Li circulate through the six positions, present everywhere.
Their workings are numinous.
Thus it is said: “These two uses have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids.”

The sun departs, the moon arrives; the moon departs, the sun arrives.
How can their comings and goings be fixed?
Li is the yin within Heaven, ever desiring to draw near below.
Thus, the sun travels from east to west, descending to meet Earth.
Kan is the yang within Earth, ever desiring to draw near above.
Thus, the moon travels from west to east, ascending to meet Heaven.
How can their positions above and below be constant?
Within Li lies true water, enveloped by double yang.
Water concealed within fire—dark within, bright without—bears the image of hidden submergence.
Within Kan lies true fire, encased by double yin.
Fire concealed within water—bright within, dark without—bears the image of concealed submersion.
Water and fire mutually conceal each other, transforming endlessly.
All occurs within that single hollow point at the center, bearing the image of “transforming within.”
From here, one lifts Heaven and Earth, grasps Qian and Kun—
the great Dao does not exceed this scope.
Thus it is said: “They enfold the ten thousand things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.”

The above all elucidates the two uses of Kan and Li,
rightly revealing the meaning of “the *Yi* moves within them.”
“Using the formless to govern the formed, the vessel’s use is emptiness.”
Thus, in tracing their ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish.
This passage focuses entirely on the wondrous workings of Kan and Li.

The two uses of Kan and Li originally have no line positions.
They circulate through the six voids—this is the Void.
Yet they enfold the ten thousand things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao,
showing that the Void suffices to govern Being.
All tangible vessels in the world have solid forms.

Ultimately, what is solid and existent cannot function on its own.
Only by relying on what is empty and nonexistent can it be governed.
As Laozi said: “Clay is shaped into vessels, yet it is their emptiness that gives them their use.”
So it is with Kan and Li—using the nonexistent to govern the existent, their wondrous function lies entirely in the central void.
Thus it is said: “Using the nonexistent to govern the existent, the vessel’s use is emptiness.”
From nonexistence entering existence is called *xixi*—the moment for advancing the fire, when Kun’s three lines transform into Qian.
From existence entering nonexistence is called *xiaoxiao*—the moment for withdrawing the tally, when Qian’s three lines transform into Kun.
From the new moon, when the Zhen trigram takes effect, passing through Dui to Qian;
from the full moon, when the Xun trigram takes effect, passing through Gen to Kun—
in this process, the line positions of Kan and Li are nowhere to be seen, which is called the vanishing of Kan and Li.
Yet they do not truly vanish; they circulate through the six voids, flowing without cease.

Words are not idly fabricated, nor are theories baselessly conceived.
They are drawn from verification and effect, calibrated to the workings of the numinous.
By analogy and structural alignment, principles are established as evidence.
To know the *Yi* in the sun and moon is precisely such analogy and structural alignment—
this is the image of calibrating to the numinous, with clear verification.
Thus it can be taken as evidence of principle, not mere idle discourse.
This passage merely introduces what follows.

Kan is the essence of the moon, Li the radiance of the sun.
Sun and moon embody the *Yi*, with firmness and softness in perfect balance.
Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end.
Green, red, white, and black each occupy their respective directions,
yet all are governed by the central palace, the work of Wu and Ji.
This passage speaks of the union of these two entities, never departing from the true earth of the central palace.

Kan is the moon, containing within it the Wu earth.
Wu earth originally derives from Qian, yang submerged in yin, its essence concealed within—
what is called “dim and obscure, yet within it lies the essence.”
Li is the sun, containing within it the Ji earth.
Ji earth originally emerges from Kun, yin attached to yang, its radiance outwardly expressed—
what is called “elusive and indistinct, yet within it lies the substance.”
When the radiance of the sun and the essence of the moon converge in the central yellow path,
they unite to form the primordial Great Simplicity.
This is precisely because within them, one Wu and one Ji—firmness and softness—are inherently paired and perfectly matched.
Thus it is said: “Sun and moon embody the *Yi*, with firmness and softness in perfect balance.”

Wu and Ji earths can be divided or united.
In terms of the four seasons: wood flourishes in spring, with Chen earth concealed within;
fire flourishes in summer, with Wei earth concealed within;
metal flourishes in autumn, with Xu earth concealed within;
water flourishes in winter, with Chou earth concealed within.
Wood, fire, metal, and water, from beginning to end, are all enveloped within the true earth of the center.
Thus it is said: “Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving through beginning and end.”
In terms of the four directions: the Azure Dragon, bearing the virtue of wood, resides in the east;
the Vermilion Bird, bearing the virtue of fire, resides in the south;
the White Tiger, bearing the essence of metal, resides in the west;
the Dark Warrior, bearing the essence of water, resides in the north.
Thus it is said: “Green, red, white, and black each occupy their respective directions.”
North (1) and west (4) combine to form five—this is Wu earth, within which lies the obscure essence.
East (3) and south (2) combine to form five—this is Ji earth, within which lies the elusive substance.
Relying on this true earth of Wu and Ji to harmonize water and fire, to blend metal and wood,
the five phases and four images converge within the central yellow, and the Great Elixir is formed.
Thus it is said: “All are governed by the central palace, the work of Wu and Ji.”

The sun is firm, the moon is soft—they balance each other to become the Great Simplicity.
Thus the *Yi* is called Kan and Li—how could this be idly fabricated?
It is analogy and structural alignment.
The five phases and four seasons all derive from the earth of the central palace.
Thus the *Yi* moves within them—how could this theory be baseless?
It is established by tracing principles as evidence.
This passage summarizes the overarching meaning of the entire chapter.
The opening states, “The *Yi* moves within them,” and further, “transformation occurs within”—
this precisely refers to the true earth of the central palace.
The discussion of the two entities, Kan and Li, never departs from the true earth, thereby forming the Three Families.
To speak of the two entities is to include the four images within them; to speak of the Three Families is to include the five phases within them.
All medicinal substances and fire phases are contained therein.
The great function of Qian and Kun culminates in Kan and Li;
the wondrous function of Kan and Li returns to Wu and Ji.
The key to the entire *Cantong Qi* lies here.

Appendix:
Master Tan said: “Kneading emptiness into clods, one sees the clods but not the emptiness—this is earth after the opening of Heaven and Earth.
Grinding clods into emptiness, one sees the emptiness but not the clods—this is earth in the primordial chaos.
How wondrous!”

Chapter Three: The Sun and Moon Contain the Tally
*(The four lines beginning “The sun contains the essence of the five phases” were mistakenly included in the “Ruler and Minister Govern the Polity” chapter in common editions; this has now been corrected according to the collated藏本.)*

The *Yi* is imagery.
No imagery is more luminous than the suspended images of the sun and moon.
The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the regulation of the six pitch-pipes.
Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew.
Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.
Like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns—entering and exiting, coiling and uncoiling.
The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing from the lines, one extracts the tally—
the tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams.
From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen comes to receive the tally.
At this moment, Heaven and Earth unite their essences, sun and moon mutually sustain each other.
The male yang broadcasts the primordial bestowal; the female yin transforms the yellow embryo.
Chaos intermingles and exchanges, establishing the root and foundation.
Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating the spirit to form the body—
all creatures emerge by treading this path, and none that wriggle and move do not follow it.
This chapter particularly illuminates the function of the sun and moon,
investigating the origin of the medicinal substances.

The *Yi* is imagery.
No imagery is more luminous than the suspended images of the sun and moon.
The sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the regulation of the six pitch-pipes.
Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew.

To fathom the numinous and comprehend transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.
Like spokes converging at the hub or a wheel in ceaseless turn, they emerge and enter, coil and unfurl in alternation.
This passage speaks of the sun and moon’s conjunction, whose numinous transformations arise from spontaneity.

The preceding chapter having clarified the dual functions of *kan* and *li*,
it revealed the two entities of sunlight and lunar essence,
yet did not exhaust the principle of their conjunction.
Master Wei thus reiterates the words of the *Yi* to expound it further.
For the sun and moon as *Yi* constitute the pivotal key of the entire *Cantong qi*.
This *Yi* is the Great *Yi*; this image is the imageless image—
what the world can neither see nor know.
To know the imageless *Yi*, one need only look within;
to know the imaged *Yi*, one must gaze upward and downward to attain it.

Among the images formed in heaven, none are more manifest than the sun and moon.
Thus the *Xici zhuan* states: “*Yi* is imagery,”
and further: “No suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon.”
Why are the sun and moon uniquely called great?
The sun bears the essence of the great yang fire, its fundamental body luminous and all-pervading;
the single dark speck within is the true water of great yin.
Yang conceals yin within: outwardly white, inwardly black—hence it assumes the *li* image.
The moon embodies the essence of great yin water, its fundamental body purely dark and lightless;
the single bright speck within is the true fire of great yang.
Yin conceals yang within: outwardly black, inwardly white—hence it assumes the *kan* image.

The yang essence is fire, and fire possesses light.
The yin essence is water, and water only reflects images.
Thus the moon itself has no light; it shines only where the sun’s rays strike.
Light arises where the sun illuminates; the lunar *po* arises where it does not.
At the conjunction of *hui* and *shuo*, sun and moon share the same palace.
The moon lies beneath the sun, the sun above the moon;
the moon’s body is enveloped by the sun, its illuminated half facing heaven,
its dark half facing earth—hence it is called *hui*.
When the moon moves twenty-five degrees from the sun, a faint light appears to humanity—called *zaishengming*.
When it moves over ninety degrees, half its light becomes visible—called *shangxian*.
When sun and moon occupy opposite degrees, the moon above and the sun below,
their illumination mutually reflects: the dark half faces heaven,
the bright half faces earth, its light full and universally radiant—hence it is called *wang*.
After *wang*, as their opposition gradually shifts,
when the moon is twenty-five degrees from the sun, a faint darkness appears—called *zaishengpo*.
When it is over ninety degrees away, only half its light remains visible—called *xiaxian*.
From this point, its light gradually wanes until, its body concealed and light extinguished, it is called *hui* again.

Thus the moon’s body is not inherently round or crescent;
its phases arise solely from the sun’s illumination.
In truth, the moon waxes and wanes, while the sun knows no fullness or deficiency.
Just as the postnatal fate of mortals—birth, aging, sickness, death—shifts unpredictably,
only the single spark of prenatal nature-light remains perfectly luminous, crystalline, and enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

The celestial sphere spans 365¼ degrees.
The great yang sun traverses one degree per day, completing one circuit in a day and night—
hence a day and night together are called “one day.”
After thirty degrees, it meets the great yin moon.
The great yin moon moves slightly over thirteen degrees per day;
after slightly over twenty-nine days, it meets the sun again—
hence the cycle of *hui*, *shuo*, *xian*, and *wang* is called “one month.”

“Sun contains the essence of the five phases”: the sun, as great yang,
possesses the essence of fire, and within it the crow embodies the essence of water.
It receives the essence of wood to nourish its *qi*,
and the essence of metal to radiate its light.
At its center, it embraces the essence of earth to encompass its beginning and end—
only then is its luminous body and function complete.

“Moon receives the regulation of the six pitch-pipes”: on the *shuo* day,
the first yang establishes *zi*, and the pitch-pipe corresponds to *huangzhong*.
By *wang*, the three yangs are exhausted, corresponding to *zhonglü*.
Yang reaches its limit, and yin arises.
On the *wang* day, the first yin establishes *wu*, and the pitch-pipe corresponds to *ruibin*.
By *hui*, the three yins are complete, corresponding to *yingzhong*.
Yin reaches its limit, and yang arises again.
The six pitch-pipes encompass the six *lü* within.
Five is the center of yang numbers; doubling it yields the ten stems.
Six is the center of yin numbers; doubling it yields the twelve branches.
Five days make one *hou*; six *hou* make one *qi*.
Five multiplied by six equals thirty, precisely matching the degrees of sun-moon conjunction.
*Hui*, *shuo*, *xian*, and *wang* form an endless cycle; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew.

What is meant by “to fathom the numinous and comprehend transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives”?
Master Zhang said: “Unity gives rise to the numinous; duality gives rise to transformation.”
Judging by the luminous suspended images of the sun and moon, they appear as two entities.
Yet the single speck of yin *po* within the great yang is true water,
and the single speck of yang *hun* within the great yin is true fire.
In body, the sun and moon are *Yi*; in function, water and fire mutually conceal each other—
this is the unfathomable numinousness of yin and yang.
Thus one must trace the origin of the numinous to know whence transformation arises.
For when the sun departs, the moon arrives; when the moon departs, the sun arrives.
Their ceaseless alternation is one yet never fails to be two.
In truth, the *qi* of the great yang is concealed within the moon,
and the essence of the great yin is concealed within the sun.
Though called “departure” and “arrival,” there is in reality no departure or arrival—
two yet never fails to be one.

Whenever yin and yang stand in opposition, each departure and arrival is called transformation.
The numinous, however, is wholly present within, utterly still and unmoving, without departure or arrival.
To know transformation is to follow the sequence of what departs;
to fathom the numinous is to know inversely what arrives.
The sun and moon’s alternation endures eternally without cease—
like spokes converging at the hub or a wheel turning the carriage,
one emergence and entry distinguishing day and night,
one coiling and unfurling determining *hui* and *shuo*.

The cyclical shifts of the four seasons’ cold and heat, the ascending and descending movements of a single *yuan*-cycle—all are contained within this. Only because the numinous is unfathomable does transformation remain inexhaustible.

Within our bodies, the sun’s radiance and the moon’s essence mutually nourish and transform, converging entirely in the central palace. The unmoving primordial spirit alone can embrace both, fully sharing in the workings of creation. The *Yijing* contains three hundred and eighty-four lines, from which the *fu*-symbols are drawn—*fu* referring to the sixty-four hexagrams.

From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the *fu*. At this very moment, heaven and earth commingle their essences, sun and moon mutually sustain one another. The potent yang scatters primordial bestowal; the receptive yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles and conjoins, the first sprouts take root. Cultivation nurtures the budding node, spirit congeals to form the body. All beings tread forth from this, and every creeping, moving creature arises from it.

This passage speaks of the sun and moon’s conjunction producing the first yang. The sun and moon are the *Yi*, the root of creation. The three hundred and eighty-four lines are the functioning of the celestial revolution. Now, the *Yi* contains sixty-four hexagrams; excluding the four cardinal hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—which correspond to the furnace, cauldron, and elixir materials—the remaining sixty hexagrams yield three hundred and sixty lines, precisely matching the degrees of the celestial revolution, neither more nor less, like tallying tokens.

“Drawing the *fu*-symbols from the lines” means that within the sixty hexagrams, each must have one ruling line that holds the *fu*. For example, in *Zhun*, the ruling line is at the first position; in *Meng*, it is at the top. From the perspective of the *Yi*, it is called a hexagram; from the perspective of the elixir, it is called a *fu*.

The transition from the dark of the moon to the new moon is like the passage from *hai* to *zi* in a single day. Between the dark and new moon, sun and moon conjoin. At the northern region of *Xu* and *Wei*, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—one yang returns, precisely corresponding to the first line of *Zhen*. Thus it is said: “From the dark to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* arrives to receive the *fu*.”

At the moment of their conjunction, heaven enters earth, the moon envelops the sun. Heaven entering earth presents the image of essence-commingling; the moon enveloping the sun presents the image of mutual sustenance. *Qian* governs the scattering of essence, its true yang within the primordial descending to earth; *Kun* governs reception and transformation, its true earth within the yellow womb sequentially embracing and enveloping it. Thus it is said: “The potent yang scatters primordial bestowal; the receptive yin transforms the yellow womb.”

One primordial, one yellow, mutually enveloping, their form resembles an egg. At this time, the sun and moon halt their wheels and return to chaos. Within this chaos, they spontaneously intermingle and commingle, producing a single true seed. The foundation of the elixir is established from this. Thus it is said: “Chaos intermingles and conjoins, the first sprouts take root.”

Once this single true seed is obtained within *Kun*, it becomes the budding node. It must be cultivated and nurtured, never allowed to scatter and dissipate. Over time, it gradually congeals, and the primordial spirit begins to form an embryo. The first yang of *Zhen* emerges to receive the *fu*. Thus it is said: “Cultivation nurtures the budding node, spirit congeals to form the body.”

This single true seed is the root of all life in the great earth. Not only is it the source from which we receive the *qi* of our bodily existence, but even the tiniest creeping, moving creatures with consciousness arise and are nourished from this single point. Thus it is said: “All beings tread forth from this, and every creeping, moving creature arises from it.”

This Dao, which creation follows to generate beings, is what we must reverse to generate ourselves. As it is said: “Following it makes one human; reversing it makes the elixir.” The conjunction of the dark and new moon is the living *zi* hour; the primordial bestowal and yellow womb are where the medicine is produced. Cultivation is the gathering and uniting; the budding node is the primordial spirit.

The sun’s departure and the moon’s arrival are nothing but the true fire and *fu*-timing. To seek the primordial true seed, one must establish the root in chaos.

*Baoyizi* says: The potent yang is the dragon; the receptive yin is the tiger. “Scattering primordial bestowal” is the dragon ascending the primordial heavens and descending as rain. “Transforming the yellow womb” is the tiger entering the earth and producing metal. Heaven above entering earth below is the image of chaos intermingling and conjoining. From this, the first sprouts take root, and through cultivation, the budding node is nurtured. Once the spirit congeals, the body naturally forms. From the vastness of heaven and earth to the tiniest creeping, moving creatures with consciousness, all emerge from this.

Producing this single point externally is the descent of the root and the flow of the branch, the inexhaustible Dao of generation. Producing this single point internally is the return to the root and restoration to the origin, the Dao of long life and transcendence.

**Chapter Four: The Advance and Retreat of Heavenly Symbols**

Here, Confucius praises the vast chaos, the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* pervading emptiness. Investigating antiquity to the primordial sovereign, *Guanju* establishes the beginning.

Capping and marriage, *qi* intertwines; the first year then sprouts and flourishes. The sage is not born in vain, observing above to reveal the heavenly symbols. The heavenly symbols advance and retreat, bending and extending in accord with the seasons. Thus the *Yi* unites the heart of heaven, the hexagram *Fu* establishes the beginning’s sprout.

The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to establish the first signs. Waning and waxing respond to the seasonal rhythms, ascending and descending according to the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, clarity emerges, *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*, the first quarter is level as a string. On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete, fullness flourishes in *Jia* of the east. The toad and the hare’s spirit, the *qi* of sun and moon shine doubly bright. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s node; the hare spits forth its radiance.

Seven and eight mark the Dao’s completion, bending and lowering in descent. On the sixteenth, the mandate turns, *Xun* and *Xin* appear at dawn. *Gen* stands in the southwest, the last quarter at twenty-three. *Kun* and *Yi* on the thirtieth day, the yang path loses its companion. The node is exhausted, and succession passes on; the embodied one is reborn as the dragon. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*, *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.

Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. These four combine to make thirty, the yang *qi* searches for extinction and concealment. The eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never losing the center. The primordial essence is subtly wondrous and difficult to perceive; through calculation and measurement, its symbolic proofs are revealed.

In stillness, observe its images, modeling and likening its forms. Erect gnomons as standards, divining and awaiting to determine fortune and misfortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment when lines move. Above, observe the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, examine the flows of earth’s forms; in the center, investigate the human heart—comparing and verifying the Three Powers.

In movement, follow the nodes of the trigrams; in stillness, rely on the judgments of the *Tuan*. When *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. This chapter speaks of the celestial tally’s advance and retreat, which serves as the model for the firing times of the Golden Elixir.

Here, Confucius praises the *Hongmeng*, the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* pervading the void. Investigating antiquity reaches back to the Primordial Sovereign; the *Guanju* establishes the beginning. Cap and marriage intertwine *qi*; the first year then sprouts growth. This passage marks the inception of the firing times.

The previous chapter spoke of the interval between the dark and new moon, when the single yang receives the tally, specifically marking the time when the medicine is produced—yet the waxing and waning of the Golden Elixir’s firing times were not fully revealed. Here, they are entirely disclosed.

Of the great ways of Heaven, none surpass the Five Phases. Of the great ways of humanity, none surpass the Five Classics. These may mutually elucidate one another, each having its own origin. The *Yijing* is the head of the Five Classics, and the two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* are the head of the *Yijing*. The two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* are split from the Supreme Ultimate, and this Supreme Ultimate itself, when united, is the *Hongmeng* single *qi*; when divided, it is the two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* unite their virtues, their bodies containing the myriad transformations, their functions penetrating the Great Void.

Thus, Confucius praised them, saying: "Great is the origin of *Qian*! Supreme is the origin of *Kun*!" Is this not the beginning of yin and yang? Confucius, in editing the *Book of Documents*, began with the Two Canonical Texts, first recording the passage on investigating antiquity. Investigating antiquity reaches back to the Primordial Sovereign—this is the beginning of the *Book of Documents*. In editing the *Book of Songs*, he began with the Two Southern Courts, first listing the *Guanju* chapter. The *Guanju* establishes the beginning—this is the beginning of the *Book of Songs*. Ritual values the completion of a person, with cap and marriage as the beginning of procreation, hence it is said: "*qi* intertwines." The *Spring and Autumn Annals* records years, with the first year as the beginning of the annual sequence, hence it is said: "then sprouts growth." This immortal elder borrows worldly classics to illustrate the Daoist method.

The *Hongmeng* is the single *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. *Qian* is the cauldron that conceals the root of nature; *Kun* is the furnace that conceals the stem of life. Between them, the image of the sun and moon traversing the void. The Primordial Sovereign alludes to the primordial ancestral *qi*; the *Guanju* alludes to the mutual resonance of the two substances; "intertwining" alludes to the merging of the two *qi*; "the first year sprouts growth" refers to the initial stirring of the single yang, when the true seed is born.

The sage is not born in vain; above, he observes the manifest celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, bending and extending in response to the seasons. Thus, the *Yijing* unites the heart of Heaven, and the *Fu* trigram establishes the beginning of sprouting. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to establish the foundation. Waxing and waning respond to the seasonal pitch-pipes; rising and descending are based on the pivot of the Dipper. This passage precisely points to the return of the single yang as the foundation for making the Elixir.

The sage here refers to the sage who composed the *Yijing*. "Not born in vain" expresses the idea that he was not born without purpose. The celestial tally refers to the conjunction of the sun and moon, the natural tally of the Way of Heaven—what was called in the previous chapter "selecting the tally according to the lines." In the Dao of the Elixir, this is the timing of advancing and retreating. From the new moon to the full moon is the advance of yang fire, yang extending and yin bending, corresponding to the six hours from *zi* to *si*. From the full moon to the dark moon is the retreat of yin tally, yin extending and yang bending, corresponding to the six hours from *wu* to *hai*. In the Dao of the Elixir, movement and stillness, bending and extending, each has its proper time.

The sage silently observes the primordial transformations, knowing that the time must not be lost. He always commits his will to emptiness and nothingness to respond to it. As the *Yin Fu Jing* says: "Observe the Way of Heaven, grasp the movements of Heaven." The Way of Heaven, through the conjunction of the sun and moon, has advance and retreat, bending and extending. The Dao of the Elixir also takes the conjunction of the sun and moon; its advance and retreat, bending and extending are none other than the *Yijing*. Yet the sun and moon as the *Yijing* are truly governed by the heart of Heaven. The heart of Heaven is the master within creation—it is the Supreme Ultimate. The precelestial Supreme Ultimate creates Heaven and Earth in formlessness; the postcelestial Supreme Ultimate moves Heaven and Earth in form. In Heaven, it is precisely between the north and south poles; in humans, it is between the functions of *kan* and *li*. One *kan* and one *li*, combined, make the *Yijing*, governed by the heart at the very center of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: "The *Yijing* unites the heart of Heaven."

The heart of Heaven unites all things, yet it is seen only in the *Fu* trigram. Why? The essence of the heart of Heaven is originally neither movement nor stillness. The function of the heart of Heaven, however, is precisely in the alternation of movement and stillness. At the interval between *hai* and *zi*, when stillness is at its utmost, the sun and moon conjoin, the mysterious mechanism halts its turning. This heart is perfectly centered, without the slightest trace to be seen. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is most profound, the myriad transformations return to the root—suddenly, from nothing, being is born; from extreme stillness, movement arises. From the depths of utmost yin, a single speck of true yang bursts forth, revealing the face of *Qian*’s origin. And from this, the foundation of the Elixir is established.

Thus, Confucius praised the *Yijing*, saying: "*Fu*—is this not the manifestation of the heart of Heaven and Earth?" Master Shao’s poem says: "At the winter solstice, the midpoint of *zi*, the heart of Heaven does not change." This is what is meant by: "the *Fu* trigram establishes the beginning of sprouting." The *Fu* trigram has *Zhen* within and *Kun* without. The single yang of *Zhen* obtains the original body of *Qian*; though it receives the true seed from the father *Qian*, it truly relies on the nurturing of the mother *Kun*. Like an infant just conceived, its form is complete though small, still not yet emerged from the mother’s womb. Thus it is said: "The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to establish the foundation."

Once the single yang has returned, it waxes and wanes, first corresponding to the Yellow Bell among the six pitch-pipes. When the single yang first stirs, it descends and then ascends, as the Dipper’s handle points precisely to *Yuanxiao*. The alchemist who attains this blows the pitch-pipes of his body, and water and fire naturally harmonize. He turns the Dipper’s handle of his body, and metal and wood naturally merge. Is this not what is meant by: "Waxing and waning respond to the seasonal pitch-pipes; rising and descending are based on the pivot of the Dipper"?

This marks the moment described in the previous chapter when *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. On the third day, clarity emerges as *Zhen* (☳) and *Geng* receive from the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* (☱) receives *Ding*, and the first quarter hangs level as a taut cord. By the fifteenth day, the celestial stem’s body is complete, fully ripened as *Jia* faces east. The toad and the rabbit’s spirit—sun and moon’s *qi*—shine in dual brightness. The toad observes the hexagram’s nodes; the rabbit spits forth radiant light. When seven and eight of the Way are fulfilled, it bends and descends in gradual decline. On the sixteenth, the turning point shifts governance, as *Xun* (☴) and *Xin* meet the dawn’s level glow. *Gen* (☶) stands straight in the southwest; the last quarter arrives on the twenty-third. On the thirtieth day of *Kun* (☷) and *Yi*, the yang path loses its companion. When the node is exhausted, succession is passed on, and the embodied dragon is reborn.

This passage expounds the *Eight Trigrams’ Reception of the Celestial Stems* to verify the advance and retreat of the elixir’s firing times. As stated earlier, the return of the single yang occurs at the *hai-zi* hour in a day, at the winter solstice in a year, and at the dark-new moon in a month. To understand the firing times of the lesser celestial cycle in a month, one must carefully examine the *Celestial Stems’ Reception* in the *Former Heaven Eight Trigrams*. At the cusp of dark and new moon, sun and moon conjoin their tally. *Qian* and *Kun* remain unsevered; primal yellow is not yet divided.

The yang light is enveloped by the yin essence, concealed and unseen. This is the moment when our body returns to the root and restores life. Once the union is complete, the moon gradually drifts apart from the sun, and within the yin essence, yang begins to stir. By the third day, a faint glow first appears above the *geng* direction. The *Zhen* trigram receives *geng*, advancing to embrace a single yang—this is the initial manifestation of the primal nature, and the lead cauldron grows warm. Thus it is said: *“On the third day, it emerges as clarity; Zhen receives geng in the west.”* By the eighth day, the yang spirit gradually strengthens while the yin essence wanes; within the yin, yang now holds half, and at dusk, it appears in the south—this is the first quarter. The *Dui* trigram receives *ding*, advancing to embrace two yangs—here, the primal nature reveals itself further, and light pierces the curtains. Thus it is said: *“On the eighth day, Dui receives ding; the first quarter is level as a cord.”* By the fifteenth day, sun and moon face each other; the yin essence is entirely dispelled, and the yang spirit flourishes in fullness. Its light is complete, appearing at dusk in the east. *Qian* receives the six *jia*s, advancing to pure yang—now the primal nature shines forth, and within the cauldron, a single luminous spark glows day and night. Thus it is said: *“On the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete; in fullness, jia appears in the east.”*

Yet this lunar essence must unite with the solar spirit to achieve its radiance, truly corresponding to the two images of toad and hare. The toad symbolizes the essence of the great yang, while the hare’s essence symbolizes the light of the great yin. The toad, lurking at the water’s bottom, gazes intently, ceaselessly inhaling the golden essence of the sun into its belly. This illustrates the solar spirit infusing its essence into the moon, drawn inward from without. All hares in the world are female, bearing no males; gazing afar at the jade hare in the moon, they conceive, and when they give birth, they do so from the mouth. This illustrates the lunar essence receiving the sun’s light and releasing it from within. *Li* (☲) and *ji* govern the sun’s light, inherently bestowing. *Kan* (☵) and *wu* govern the moon’s essence, inherently transforming. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. Thus, from the last quarter to the dark-new moon, the moon emerges in the west at the *you* position, its entire body absorbing the sun’s essence and qi. From the first quarter to the full moon, the moon waxes in the east at the *mao* position, its entire body revealing the sun’s radiance. Thus it is said: *“Toad and hare’s essence—sun and moon’s qi shine as one.”* The reason for invoking the toad and hare lies in the toad’s gaze and the hare’s ability to birth from its mouth. The waxing and waning of the moon’s light wholly depend on its regard for the sun’s light to advance or retreat.

A single yin arises in *Xun* (☴), its light gradually withdrawing until the dark moon—this is the mechanism of creation’s inward turn. A single yang arises in *Zhen* (☳), its light gradually unfolding until the full moon—this is the mechanism of creation’s outward turn. At the cusp of dark and new moon, the sun’s light is absorbed into the moon’s essence, swallowing and devouring each other, stirred to conception. Only when the third day’s *geng* emerges is the light, once swallowed, regurgitated, turning from west to east, from *geng* to *jia*, until the full moon, when its radiance is complete. Thus it is said: *“The toad gazes at the trigram’s node; the hare births light by spitting.”*

After the fifteenth day of the full moon, yang reaches its zenith above; fullness cannot endure, and what rises must descend, what expands must contract—yang fire transforms into yin tally. Thus it is said: *“The seven-eight path is spent; bending, it descends low.”* From the sixteenth day onward, yang becomes the guest, yin the host. The yang spirit submits to the governance of the yin essence, and within the spirit, yin begins to stir. At dawn, it appears in the *xin* direction. The *Xun* trigram receives *xin*, retreating to embrace a single yin—this is the beginning of nature returning to life. Thus it is said: *“On the sixteenth, succession is passed on; Xun and xin appear at dawn.”* By the twenty-third day, the yin essence gradually strengthens while the yang spirit wanes; within the spirit, yin now holds half—this is the last quarter. At dawn, it appears in the *bing* direction. The *Gen* trigram receives *bing*, retreating to embrace two yins—this is nature halfway returned to life. Thus it is said: *“Gen aligns with the southwest; the last quarter is the twenty-third.”* By the thirtieth day, *Gen*’s single yang, lost in the northeast, now resides in the *yi* direction of *Kun*’s earth, embodying the image of the northeast’s lost companion. The single yang spirit is wholly gathered into the yin essence—this is nature returning to life, the primal yang reverting to chaos. Thus it is said: *“On the thirtieth day of Kun and yi, the yang path loses its companion.”* Yet yang cannot be entirely eroded; when the trigram’s node is exhausted, what wanes must cease, what descends must rise. The end of *Bo* (剥) is the beginning of *Fu* (复); the end of the dark moon is the beginning of the new. *Zhen*’s single yang, having inherited the body of the father *Qian*, now re-establishes its foundation in the mother *Kun*. Above *geng*, light is once more birthed by spitting. Thus it is said: *“When the node is exhausted, succession is passed on, and the embodied dragon is reborn.”*

*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six are likewise balanced. These four combine to thirty, and the yang qi seeks concealment. The eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never losing the center. This passage concludes the beginning and end of the *Celestial Stems’ Reception*.

The *Eight Trigrams’ Reception of the Celestial Stems* originally derives from the *Former Heaven* circular diagram, most profoundly abstruse. *Kan*, the middle son, receives *wu*, yin enfolding yang—the body of the moon. *Li*, the middle daughter, receives *ji*, yang enfolding yin—the body of the sun. *Zhen*, the eldest son, and *Xun*, the eldest daughter, receive *geng* and *xin*. *Gen*, the youngest son, and *Dui*, the youngest daughter, receive *bing* and *ding*. Between them, each yin and yang pair matches the other. The father *Qian* alone receives *jia* and *ren*; the mother *Kun* alone receives *yi* and *gui*. From origin to end, key to beginning and conclusion, they encompass the six children within. Thus it is said: *“Ren and gui pair with jia and yi; Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end.”* The six children are lesser yin and lesser yang; lesser yang is seven, lesser yin is eight, together making fifteen.

Qian and Kun are old yang and old yin. Old yang is numbered nine, old yin is numbered six, together also making fifteen. This precisely corresponds to the upper and lower crescents, forming the image of the full moon. Thus it is said: *“Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six are likewise equivalent.”* The two lesser and two elder yin-yang pairs respond to the qi of the two crescents, mutually waxing and waning. Therefore, from new moon to full moon, yang grows while yin naturally wanes. From full moon to dark moon, yin grows while yang likewise wanes. At the dark moon, yang qi wanes and recedes, seeming to vanish and disappear, nearly exhausted. Yet who knows that a single point of primordial essence lies deeply hidden within the cavernous void, cycling endlessly without cease? Thus it is said: *“The four combine to thirty; yang qi wanes and hides away.”*

The eight trigrams are arrayed in a circle, sun and moon unite as jade disks to generate light. The three yang and three yin mutually wax and wane, seemingly without fixed positions for Kan and Li. Yet as they circulate through the six voids, ascending and descending, it is none other than the central qi of Kan and Li that shifts and moves between them. This is why the sun and moon are the Changes, governing the celestial mind and serving as the standard for the advance and retreat of the three yin and three yang. Thus it is said: *“The eight trigrams array their luminaries; their movement never loses the center.”*

The primordial essence is wondrous and difficult to perceive; one infers and measures it to verify its signs. In stillness, observe its image and model its form. Set up a gnomon as a standard to divine auspices and determine fortune. Issue commands in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of a moving line. This passage speaks of the correspondence between every movement and stillness and the celestial tally.

The trigrams and lines have movement and stillness; so too does the firing time of the golden elixir. When the appointed time has not yet arrived, one should wait in emptiness. For when Kan and Li unite, between them naturally resides a single point of primordial essence—this is the true seed of prior Heaven. It is that of which it is said: *“Vast and obscure, within it lies essence.”* This entity is most numinous and wondrous, beyond sight or hearing, difficult to conjecture. One can only infer the waxing and waning of the received celestial stems as verification of the celestial tally’s advance and retreat. Thus it is said: *“The primordial essence is wondrous and difficult to perceive; one infers and measures it to verify its signs.”*

The advance and retreat of the celestial tally have no form; within the formless and imageless, it seems to exist yet not exist. One should simply empty the mind and experience it, modeling its form and carefully awaiting its ebb and flow. Thus it is said: *“In stillness, observe its image and model its form.”* When the appointed time nears, one should move to respond. For between the dark and new moon, yang desires to arise yet has not departed from yin; the mechanism has stirred yet not departed from stillness. From within stillness, one must observe with utmost care. Like astronomers who set up gnomons to measure solar halos, or diviners who observe omens to determine fortune, not a single error can be made. Thus it is said: *“Set up a gnomon as a standard to divine auspices and determine fortune.”* This speaks of the moment before movement.

When the pivot is triggered and Heaven and humanity respond in unison, one must then apply the work of gathering. Like the court issuing great decrees at the proper time, or the seasons of creation being timely enacted, not a single moment’s delay is permissible. Thus it is said: *“Issue commands in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of a moving line.”* This “time” is the “time to partake” in the *Yin Fu Jing*, referring to the living midnight hour between the dark and new moon. When the first yang stirs at the winter solstice, it belongs to the proper midnight hour.

Observe above the patterns of the River Chart, examine below the flows of earthly forms, and investigate between them the human heart, synthesizing and considering the Three Powers. In movement, follow the nodes of the trigrams; in stillness, rely on the judgments of the hexagrams. Qian and Kun put their functions into effect, and only then is the world governed. This passage speaks of the principle of every movement and stillness pervading the Three Powers.

Above is Qian, below is Kun—this encompasses beginning and end, the positions of Heaven above and Earth below. The central qi of Kan and Li shifts and moves between them, the position of humanity in the center. Here the images of the Three Powers are already fully present. This principle of movement and stillness thus penetrates Heaven and Earth, encompassing the River and Luo. The patterns of the River Chart refer to the Dragon Diagram; the numbers of the River Chart, fifty-five in total, cycle endlessly without cease, round to resemble Heaven’s movement. Observing above the patterns of the River Chart is to look up and contemplate the celestial patterns. The flows of earthly forms refer to the Luo Writing; the positions of the Luo Writing, four cardinal and four ordinal directions, are governed by the central five, square to resemble Earth’s stillness. Examining below the flows of earthly forms is to look down and inspect earthly principles.

Humanity is the heart of Heaven and Earth. Between Heaven and Earth lies the human heart—this is what Shaozi meant by *“Between one movement and one stillness lies the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.”* For this heart is neither movement nor stillness, yet can move and be still, uniting Heaven and Earth as the pivot of creation. Thus it is said: *“Investigate between them the human heart, synthesizing and considering the Three Powers.”*

In movement, respond to Heaven: yin and yang advance and retreat, necessarily following the nodes of the trigrams’ lines. Thus it is said: *“In movement, follow the nodes of the trigrams.”* This is what the *Xici Zhuan* means by *“In movement, observe its changes and contemplate its omens,”* and also the meaning of the earlier phrase *“issue commands in accord with the seasons.”*

In stillness, respond to Earth: hardness and softness have exterior and interior, never exceeding the words of the trigrams’ lines. Thus it is said: *“In stillness, rely on the judgments of the hexagrams.”* This is what the *Xici Zhuan* means by *“In stillness, observe its images and contemplate its words,”* and also the meaning of the earlier phrase *“model its form.”*

When stillness reaches its extreme, true yang stirs above the nine heavens—this is Qian’s primal yang employing nine, and the primordial spirit ascending to Qian’s crucible. When movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness, true yin hides below the nine earths—this is Kun’s primal yin employing six, and the primordial qi returning to Kun’s furnace. The primordial spirit is nature; the primordial qi is life.

With nature perfected and life established, the celestial heart sits in solemn dignity at the central pole. The hundred joints and myriad spirits all converge and return to life—is this not what is meant by *“When Qian and Kun are employed in action, the world is then ordered”*? The first chapter states, *“Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the Changes,”* while the second chapter says, *“Heaven and Earth take their positions.”* Here, the opening reveals *“the virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the empty void,”* the middle speaks of *“Qian and Kun encompassing beginning and end,”* and the conclusion declares *“Qian and Kun employed in action.”* Thus, from beginning to end, it is only Qian and Kun that serve as the essence—making the meaning of the “gate and door” all the more evident.

The first chapter states, *“Kan and Li frame the structure, turning the wheel and aligning the axle.”* The second chapter says, *“Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun.”* This chapter first speaks of *“the qi of sun and moon shining in dual brightness,”* then of *“their movement shifting without losing the center,”* and finally reveals *“the two functions.”* Thus, from beginning to end, it is only Kan and Li that serve as the function—making the intent of “framing the structure” all the more transparent.

Master Baoyi said: *“The toad is the essence of metal qi, thus it waxes gradually according to the hexagram’s phases. The jade hare is the spirit of mao-wood, thus it emits light when gazing upon the great yang.”* This chapter is profoundly abstruse. The wondrous meaning of *na jia* derives from the ancient *Hetu* and the Primordial Circular Diagram, serving not only as the great linchpin of the entire *Cantong Qi* but also as the very marrow of the *Changes* of Fu Xi. The two images of the toad and the hare’s spirit are especially rare and perilously sublime. The Venerable Wei nearly coughed up his heart and liver over this—from now on, commentators and authors may look at one another and smile.

**Chapter Five: The Sovereign and Minister Administering Governance**
How could one not be cautious?

At the forefront of administering governance lies *(renewing the old and reforming the decayed)*. It encompasses the subtle and the meticulous, unfurling and bestowing treasures. The essential Dao and its pivotal handle, the unifying thread of transformation—these are the warp and woof of cosmic order. When the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without. The five planets move in错综 or orderly paths, responding to the seasons in mutual resonance. When the four and seven fall into discord, they diverge and converge, bowing and rising. The Literary Star governs and records, while the censors and ministers are questioned and held to account. The hundred officials and their bureaus each oversee their respective domains. Tracing beginnings to endings, one discerns the threads of survival and demise.

Should the sovereign grow arrogant and indolent, swelling with excess and straying from the Dao; or should ministers turn deceitful and sycophantic, their conduct deviating from the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the lunar phases, the expansions and contractions of celestial cycles, will fall into disorder, bringing forth calamity and blame. Those who uphold the law must admonish and reprove, exposing faults to admonish the ruler. When the Pole Star holds its rightful place, *(receiving)* the center, it moves with ease, entrusting matters to those below. When the Hall of Light enacts governance, the state remains free of harmful ways.

This chapter employs the successes and failures of sovereign and ministers in administering governance as a metaphor for the successes and failures of the fire-phase in the alchemy of Golden Elixir. How could one not be cautious?

At the forefront of administering governance lies *(renewing the old and reforming the decayed)*. It encompasses the subtle and the meticulous, unfurling and bestowing treasures. The essential Dao and its pivotal handle, the unifying thread of transformation—these are the warp and woof of cosmic order. When the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without. The five planets move in错综 or orderly paths, responding to the seasons in mutual resonance. When the four and seven fall into discord, they diverge and converge, bowing and rising. The Literary Star governs and records, while the censors and ministers are questioned and held to account. The hundred officials and their bureaus each oversee their respective domains.

This passage employs governance as a metaphor for the caution required in the initial stages of regulating the firing process. The essence of the firing process demands vigilance from beginning to end, guarding against danger and contemplating risk without a moment’s laxity. Just as a ruler must be especially prudent at the outset of governance, so too does the great Dao of the Golden Elixir take the celestial mind as its master and essence-qi as its function—akin to a sovereign’s command over ministers. Hence, it is called "governing administration."

When the adept first enters the chamber, the initial stirring of yang is termed the "primary meridian," much like a ruler’s ascension to the throne and the reform of the calendar, marking the first year. The preceding chapter’s "first year" signifies the sprouting of the germ, echoing this principle. Thus, the immortal master sighs and begins, "How could one not be cautious? At the forefront of administering governance..."

"Encompassing the subtle and the meticulous" refers to stillness and inward guarding, the sealing of all gates. "Unfurling and bestowing treasures" signifies movement in response to opportunity, issuing decrees in accord with the moment. The "pivotal handle" is the Dipper’s handle, for the Dipper is the celestial tongue, measuring and harmonizing primordial transformation, governing the entire heavens. Like a net’s main cord or a garment’s fastening, it is the essential Dao. This illustrates that the celestial mind within the body is the guiding principle of all transformations. The workings of the elixir path rely entirely on the celestial mind’s operation of the Dipper’s handle to advance and shift. Hence, it is said, "The essential Dao and its pivotal handle, the unifying thread of transformation."

Since the celestial mind is the warp and woof of all transformations, movement in alignment brings universal fortune, while deviation invites misfortune. The *Xici Zhuan* states, "When the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without"—this is its meaning. In the *Book of Changes*, it is the lines and images; in the heavens, it is the stellar configurations. The sky has three enclosures: the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, home of the North Star, lies deepest within. The Supreme Subtlety Enclosure follows, and the Celestial Market Enclosure comes after. Beyond these, the five planets—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—and the twenty-eight lunar mansions encircle the enclosures. The ruling stars within the enclosures all depend on the Dipper’s handle; every planet and fixed star, whether moving in sequence or retrograding, obeys its command.

When the Dipper’s handle moves in harmony, the five planets and fixed stars all follow their proper courses. Should the handle falter, the encircling planets immediately reverse their paths. Their resonance with the seasons reveals immediate omens of misfortune. The celestial bodies across the heavens likewise deviate from their regular paths, leading to "divergence, convergence, bowing, and rising." This mirrors the human celestial sovereign: when it remains unmoved, the five senses err, and the hundred meridians surge chaotically—what is called the slightest deviation preventing the elixir’s formation.

The aberrations of celestial phenomena cannot be blamed on the myriad stars; nor can a ruler’s misgovernance be attributed to the hundred officials. Each office has its overseer—who, then, is the true master? In the heavens, it is the Literary Star and the censorial ministers. The Literary Star comprises the six stars of the Winnowing Basket within the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, known as the Southern Culmen, recording the register of human longevity. The censorial ministers are the Three Terraces and Four Auxiliaries within the enclosure, corresponding to the three powers and four images, each stationed in its proper quadrant, encircling and upholding the celestial pole.

The Literary Star in the heavens is like the six ministries of a ruler; the censorial ministers are like the chief ministers. The chief ministers assist the sovereign in harmonizing yin and yang, while the six ministries carry out their decrees. Thus, the hundred officials and their bureaus, without need for reproach, naturally oversee their respective domains. This is akin to the firing process: when the heart-sovereign resides at the center to govern the exterior, the Dipper’s handle and the Northern Asterism sit in vigil, the handle revolving to regulate water and fire in perfect harmony. Naturally, the six roots attain great stability, the hundred meridians achieve profound harmony, and no reckless or errant movements occur.

Tracing the origin and contemplating the end reveals the threads of survival and ruin. Should the ruler grow arrogant and indulgent, exceeding bounds and violating the Dao, or should ministers turn deceitful and perverse, acting outside proper norms, the waxing and waning of celestial bodies will deviate, foretelling misfortune. The enforcers of the law will censure and reproach, admonishing the ruler for transgressions. When the celestial pole is rightly aligned, governance flows effortlessly; when the Hall of Light enacts policies, the state suffers no harmful Dao. This passage speaks of the firing process’s essence: the sovereign must remain as vigilant at the end as at the beginning.

Every movement and stillness in the firing process, from start to finish, demands unceasing caution—just as a ruler’s every action, from beginning to end, must be equally vigilant. Vigilance transforms ruin into survival; negligence turns survival into ruin. The threads of survival and ruin diverge here. This great matter is the shared responsibility of ruler and ministers, yet the sovereign alone bears ultimate authority. For ministers obey the ruler as qi obeys intent. When the heart-sovereign is reverent and steadfast in its purpose, no deceitful sounds or perverse sights can intrude. But if the heart-sovereign grows arrogant and self-willed, deviating from the proper Dao, the senses will respond with deceit, and actions will stray from the norm.

The celestial mind and the human mind share a single source. Should the celestial mind falter even slightly, celestial movements immediately turn anomalous. Not only do the five planets err and the fixed stars deviate, but even the moon’s phases—new moon, full moon, waxing, and waning—follow regular patterns. Yet when it should wax, it wanes; when it should wane, it waxes. Eclipses and obscurations bring innumerable misfortunes. The heavens have stars that enforce the law, censuring faults—namely, the Left and Right Enforcers within the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure. The court mirrors this, establishing left and right enforcers to censure transgressions. Yet the fault of violating the Dao lies not with the hundred officials, nor even with the censorial ministers, but with the ruler alone. This is the principle that all transformations follow the mind, returning to the source to trace the origin. Hence, it is said, "The enforcers of the law censure and reproach, admonishing the ruler for transgressions."

The ruler’s mind gains or loses its balance in a single reversal. For only when the sovereign establishes the supreme standard do the people return to that standard. If the mind-monarch can remain still and unmoving, governing with non-action to preserve perfect rectitude, the hundred limbs naturally follow its commands—just as the Northern Apex abides in its place and the host of stars naturally encircle it. Thus it is said: *“When the Apex-star holds its proper position, it rests at ease, entrusting all below.”* Once the mind-monarch sits in solemn dignity within the chamber of spirit, the myriad nodes and spirits all become reverently obedient, just as when the king sits in the Hall of Light to receive the feudal lords, the four seas and nine provinces submit without exception. How then could there be any who emerge to obstruct transformation and harm the Dao? Thus it is said: *“When the Hall of Light enacts governance, the state suffers no harm to the Dao.”*

The Apex-star in the celestial pattern is the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, the abode of the Northern Apex. In the ruler, it is the inner chamber where he retires to rest. The Hall of Light in the celestial pattern is the Celestial Market Enclosure, where the Emperor-star descends. In the ruler, it is the place of court assemblies, the thoroughfare to the nine Yi and eight Man. Where the mind-monarch resides, within lies the Grotto Chamber, without lies the Hall of Light—above corresponding to the celestial enclosures, below mirroring the court’s tranquility. Thus it takes the image of governing the polity.

This chapter clarifies the governance of the Dao through the illumination of the elixir path, making it most evident. The elixir path, from beginning to end, does not depart from the mind-monarch’s operation. Hence, the ruler is likened to the celestial mind, the ministers to the medicinal substances, the Literary Prosperity and Grand Supporters to the Three Fields and Four Images, the law-enforcing ministers to the officials of the ears and eyes, and the hundred officials and functionaries to the essence and qi throughout the body. Fortune arises from receiving qi; misfortune from guarding against qi. *“Presence”* signifies obtaining the medicine in an instant; *“absence”* signifies losing it in a moment.

What is prized in governing the polity is that one must externally repel all perverse influences and internally assist the true sovereign. When the mind-monarch sits in solemn dignity at the Everlasting Apex, the myriad transformations submit to the Hall of Light—is this not the essential path of returning to the true? The first chapter of this work clarifies the gates of Qian and Kun to reveal Qian and Kun as the body; the second chapter clarifies the two functions of Kan and Li to reveal Kan and Li as their use; the third chapter speaks of the conjunction of new and full moons to produce the medicinal substances; the fourth chapter speaks of the celestial tally’s advance and retreat to enact the firing times—all are images of governing the polity. Yet the meaning of governing the polity must be made clear: in the celestial pattern, it is the Everlasting Apex governing the host of stars throughout the heavens; in the court, it is the sovereign governing the hundred officials and functionaries; in the elixir path, it is the mind-monarch governing the essence and qi throughout the body—this is the meaning of governing the polity. Thus this chapter concludes it.

The preceding section (the middle chapter of the upper volume, comprising three chapters on nurturing inherent nature) is the middle of the upper volume. This volume focuses on nurturing inherent nature, with governing the polity and ingesting the elixir already contained within it. For the primordial ancestral nature is still and unmoving, yet responsive and immediately penetrating. It does not depart from the Central Yellow, serving as the master of the myriad transformations. To speak of nature is to include destiny within it; to speak of nurturing inherent nature is to return both primordial essence and primordial qi to the primordial spirit. Only by knowing and nurturing it can one accord with the great Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—emptiness and spontaneity. Thus the final chapter is again titled *Nurturing Inherent Nature in the Manner of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*.

**Chapter Six: Refining the Self and Establishing the Foundation**

Within, nurture the self in tranquility and emptiness.
Trace back to the hidden luminosity, inwardly illuminating the body.
Seal the orifices, fortify the numinous root.
The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.
Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought.
The Yellow Center gradually opens its principles, moistening and reaching the skin.
Begin with rectitude, and the end will be cultivated—once established, it can be upheld.
With the One, all is concealed; the world knows nothing of it.

This chapter speaks of refining the self and establishing the foundation in attaining the One—it is the initial practice of nurturing inherent nature.

*Within, nurture the self in tranquility and emptiness.
Trace back to the hidden luminosity, inwardly illuminating the body.
Seal the orifices, fortify the numinous root.
The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.
Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought.*

This passage speaks of the initial foundation of refining the self. The preceding chapters on governing the polity merely expounded the transformative patterns of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li. Only here is the work of refining the self directly pointed out, showing the practitioner where to begin. As Ancestor Lü said: *“The sevenfold return of the elixir lies in man, but first one must refine the self and await the time.”* Master Zhang Ziyang said: *“If one wishes to complete the nine transformations, one must first refine the self and hold the mind.”* Refining the self is nurturing the self. The self is the earth of the center within Li, the abode of the root of inherent nature. Only because the primordial Qian-nature has transformed into the posterior Li, and the primordial spirit has turned into the consciousness-spirit, does the yin qi within the heart flow ceaselessly, easily lost and difficult to uphold—without the primordial supreme yang qi of Kan, there is nothing to restrain it. Yet the primordial One Qi arises from emptiness; without the work of attaining emptiness and preserving stillness, how can one trace back to the origin and return to the root? Thus it is said: *“Within, nurture the self in tranquility and emptiness.”*

At the moment of receiving qi in birth, there was originally a single point of numinous clarity, possessed by all. Only because the posterior takes charge, the root is lodged in the dust, the dust turns into consciousness, and daily one races outward in pursuit, inevitably turning away from enlightenment and joining with the dust, mistaking the servant for the master. Thus one must moment by moment withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, so that the single point of numinous clarity naturally hides and does not reveal itself, deeply concealed as if empty. From this, silently illuminating within, one comes to know that the body of the four great elements is but a temporary aggregation, ultimately a bubble of illusion—immediately one attains liberation. Thus it is said: *“Trace back to the hidden luminosity, inwardly illuminating the body.”*

Dui is the mouth, the gateway of entry and exit for the entire body. All places where primordial qi leaks are called Dui, but they are all governed by the square-inch aperture. The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *“Within the square inch, carefully conceal and store”*—this is the meaning of sealing. Within this square inch lies a single point of the most numinous substance, the root and stock of all generation and transformation.

Thus it is called the "numinous stock." To fortify it is to prevent leakage and wavering. The Three Lights in heaven are the sun, moon, and Dipper; in humans, *Li* corresponds to the sun, *Kan* to the moon, and the Heavenly Heart at the center to the pivot of the Dipper. One *Kan* and one *Li*, meeting north and south. Turning inward to listen and illuminate, the true person hides in the deep abyss; sealing the gates and fortifying the guard, the primordial pearl is obtained from the formless. Thus the Heavenly Heart remains still and unmoving, and the work of refining the self is accomplished. Hence it is said: *“The Three Lights sink into obscurity, nurturing the child-pearl.”*

Yet this original single point of numinous light flickers in and out of existence, neither near nor far, ever present before one’s eyes—yet people do not recognize it. Sought within the body, it cannot be found; sought outside the body, it cannot be found. Thus it is said: *“Invisible when seen, near yet easily sought.”* Gradually the Yellow Center penetrates principle, its moisture reaching the skin. When the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated; when the trunk stands firm, the branches may be grasped. The One is for concealment—no one in the world knows this.

This passage speaks of the work of refining the self as lying in attaining the One. The *Scripture on Salvation* says: *“Within the center, the five qi harmonize, and the hundred spirits merge.”* Clearly, the Yellow Court’s cinnabar chamber is the gathering place of all transformations. It is like the North Star’s abode, around which all stars naturally array themselves. Those who cultivate the Dao nurture the child-pearl here, neither forgetting nor forcing; over time, spirit and clarity arise of themselves. Gradually, the four directions and eight reaches open, the nine orifices, hundred channels, three hundred sixty joints, and eighty-four thousand pores of the body all become unobstructed, naturally radiant and harmonious, responsive and fully permeable. This is what the *Book of Changes* means by *“excellence within, flowing to the four limbs.”* Hence it is said: *“Gradually the Yellow Center penetrates principle, its moisture reaching the skin.”*

The Dao has a beginning and an end, a root and branches. The beginning is the initial work of refining the self; the end is the completion of the inner chamber’s task. The beginning is like the trunk of a tree, the root; the end is like its branches, the branches. Yet one must know that the very first step is also the final step of completion. As the saying goes: *“Grasp the root, and you need not worry about the branches.”* The first step plants one firmly on the correct path; from there, advancing step by step, the work of cultivation naturally aligns at every stage. The origin can encompass the end, just as the root can embrace the branches. Thus it is said: *“When the beginning is correct, the end will be cultivated; when the trunk stands firm, the branches may be grasped.”*

But then, what is the beginning, and what is the root? It lies in the One alone. Before birth, attaining the One makes one human; after birth, embracing the One completes the elixir. For the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the myriad things. Following the natural course to give birth to humans and things—this is the One. Yet reversing the course, the Three returns to the Two, the Two returns to the One, and the One returns to emptiness. Coming against the current to become a sage or immortal—this, too, is the One. The Most High said: *“Attain the One, and all affairs are complete.”* And again: *“The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female.”* The Valley Spirit is utterly empty yet utterly numinous, its wondrousness endlessly generative. From this endless generation emerges the Mysterious Female. Its essence is the One; its function is twofold. The secret lies in the two words: *concealment* and *obscuration*. To conceal is to seal the primordial gate; to obscure is to veil the female portal. Without the One at the center, how could concealment and obscuration be achieved? Yet without concealment and obscuration on the outside, how could it become the One? This subtle aperture’s wonder cannot be grasped without a true teacher’s guidance. Even with wisdom surpassing Yan and Min, none could force a guess—how much less the world’s ordinary people? Hence it is said: *“The One is for concealment—no one in the world knows this.”*

The so-called *Yellow Center* refers to the center of the ancestral aperture. The so-called *One* refers to the One within the ancestral aperture. Knowing the center, one knows the aperture; knowing the One, one knows the aperture’s wonder. Knowing the aperture’s wonder, one knows the original ancestral nature—and thus knows that guarding the center and embracing the One is the first step in nurturing one’s nature.

**Chapter Seven: The Mutual Function of the Two Apertures**
The superior virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue labors without ceasing, its function unending. Closing above is called *having*; closing below is called *nothingness*. Nothingness serves the above, where spirit and clarity reside. This two-aperture method—even the golden qi mutually depends on it. Know the white and guard the black, and spirit and clarity will come of themselves. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One. The beginning of yin and yang, it contains the Yellow Sprout. The master of the five metals, the Northern River Chariot. Thus lead is black without but holds golden radiance within—clothed in coarse robes yet hiding jade, appearing as a madman. Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of metal; the child shelters the mother’s womb. The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent—now deep in the abyss, now floating on the surface. Withdrawing, it spreads and distributes, each guarding its own domain.

Gathered, it resembles whiteness; refined, it becomes vermilion. Tempered into a protective barrier, the true resides within the white. Square and round, inch and span, blended and mutually constrained. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted. Surrounded by walls and gates, shaped like Penglai. Encircled and sealed, four directions hesitating. Guarded with utmost secrecy, blocking all treachery and evil. Curved pavilions connect, warding against the unforeseen. Free from thought, yet difficult to weary. Spirit and qi fill the chamber—none can detain them. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it is ever with the person.

This chapter directly points to the function of the *Kan* and *Li* apertures as the key to the golden elixir. The superior virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue labors without ceasing, its function unending.

When the upper is sealed, it is called "being"; when the lower is sealed, it is called "non-being." Non-being serves to uphold the upper, where the numinous dwells. These two apertures follow this method, their golden *qi* mutually dependent. This passage points to the wondrous function of the two apertures.

The Great Dao is not numinous without the One, nor transformative without the Two. The previous chapter states that the One is for concealment—having already shown people how to attain the One. Yet the marvel of concealment lies in this: its essence abides in the One, while its function does not depart from the Two. For the wondrous function of the golden elixir resides solely in the postcelestial *Kan* and *Li*, and the marvel of *Kan* and *Li* does not transcend the precosmic *Qian* and *Kun*. In the end, it is only the two words: *nature* and *life*.

Nature is the precosmic spark of spirit, the essence of true emptiness. Its essence is perfectly complete and all-pervading, neither diminishing nor increasing. In heaven, it is the primordial *Qian* that initiates all; in humans, it is the original face before parents were born. Thus it is called *superior virtue*. Within it, nothing exists—only the radiance of spirit shines, utterly free from the dust of the senses. If one seeks to measure or deduce it through the mind’s calculations, one strays ten thousand miles away. For nature is inherently natural, beyond all conjecture. It is truly unattainable when sought. Hence it is said: *"The superior virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny."*

Life is the precosmic primordial *qi*, the wondrous function of being. Its function pivots the Three Powers and encompasses the myriad transformations. In heaven, it is the generative *Kun* that nurtures all; in humans, it is the root of destiny established at the first cry of birth. Thus it is called *lesser virtue*. Within it, the primordial *qi* circulates, hidden in heaven and earth, manifesting without fixed form.

If one clings to the realm of form and sinks into emptiness, guarding stillness, one falls into the poisoned sea. For life belongs to the realm of activity and does not dwell in dead emptiness. A single breath uncirculated means death. Thus it is said: *"Lesser virtue acts with effort, its function unceasing."*

*"When the upper closes, it is called ‘being’"*—this is *Kun* entering *Qian* to become *Li*. The primordial *Qian* is originally the superior virtue, but when a single yin from *Kun* ascends, the yang *qi* of *Qian* closes it from without. This is what is meant by *"the utmost yin, solemn and still, emerges from heaven."* With this one yin within *Qian*, nature transforms into life, responding and thus communicating, becoming the active lesser virtue. People only see the emptiness within the body of *Li* and take it for true emptiness, unaware that this very point of emptiness is the wondrous being within true emptiness, called *"being within non-being."*

*"When the lower closes, it is called ‘non-being’"*—this is *Qian* entering *Kun* to become *Kan*. The primordial *Kun* is originally the lesser virtue, but when a single yang from *Qian* descends, the yin *qi* of *Kun* also closes it from without. This is what is meant by *"the utmost yang, blazing and bright, arises from earth."* With this one yang within *Kun*, life transforms back into nature, utterly still and unmoving, returning to the effortless superior virtue. People only see the fullness within the body of *Kan* and take it for wondrous being, unaware that this very point of fullness is the true emptiness within wondrous being, called *"non-being within being."*

Once *Kun* receives the *qi* of *Qian*, it returns this point of true yang upward to *Qian*. This is called returning to the root and restoring life. From within the primordial chamber of spirit, a single *yinin* is produced—this is the indestructible primordial spirit of ten thousand kalpas. Thus it is said: *"The non-being serves the above, where the numinous dwells."*

The wondrous function of the numinous resides entirely in the central yellow’s rightful position. Yet without the true essence of metal from *Kan* ascending and the true *qi* of water from *Li* descending, with being and non-being interpenetrating and the two communicating in harmony, how could the numinous ever arise? Thus it is said: *"These two apertures follow the method—metal and qi likewise depend on each other."* These two apertures are the wondrous openings of *Kan* and *Li* in their functions, the so-called Gate of the Primordial Female, unknown to the world.

Knowing the white and guarding the black, the numinous comes of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One. The beginning of yin and yang, it originally contains the yellow sprout. The master of the five metals, the river chariot of the north. Thus lead is black without but holds golden blossoms within. Cloaked in coarse cloth yet bearing jade, outwardly a madman. This passage directly points to the metal within water as the primordial elixir mother.

Following the above, the so-called numinous does not arise spontaneously but requires a certain process. This process lies entirely in knowing the white and guarding the black. The white is the true essence within *Kan*; the black is the true water within *Li*. If one can thoroughly perceive true emptiness and silently preserve wondrous being, a single point of the numinous naturally arises from the formless. As the *Heart Seal Sutra* says: *"Preserve non-being, guard being—accomplished in an instant."* This alone is the golden elixir, the point where the postnatal returns to the prenatal. Thus it is said: *"Know the white, guard the black—the numinous comes of itself."*

Master Wei, fearing that people might not recognize the original source of the golden elixir, reiterates: the white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. This white is not tangible metal but the primordial nature within the empty kalpa. The primordial nature is originally pure and unstained white—this is the face of *Qian* before birth, what is called superior virtue. Is not the white the essence of metal? This black is not the water that flows on earth but the one *qi* born of the formless. This one *qi* is originally the undivided primal chaos—this is the root of *Kun* after the first cry of birth, what is called lesser virtue. Is not the black the foundation of water?

The primordial metal-nature is the undifferentiated great Dao, as yet unnamed by the One. Once the Dao generates the One, its signs emerge, and it is called the water of Heavenly One—the pivot of the Dao, wherein the metal-nature is concealed. Thus it is said: *"Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One."* The first point of true water conceals true metal, the root of the ceaseless generation of primordial *qi*. Thus it is said: *"The beginning of yin and yang originally contains the yellow sprout."* The yellow sprout takes the image of metal concealed within water, referring to the primordial One.

The primordial One *qi* is precisely the metal-essence of *Qian*, able to govern all transformations and serve as the true sovereign of the postnatal five phases’ ceaseless generation, deeply hidden within the northern pole’s great abyss. Thus it is said: *"The master of the five metals, the river chariot of the north."* The five metals borrow the external refinement of silver, lead, cinnabar, mercury, and earth to illustrate the essence of the five phases within the body. This single thing, being purely black without, resembles lead. Yet within its blackness it contains white, thus also bearing the image of golden blossoms. It is like one cloaked in coarse cloth yet bearing jade within, outwardly a madman yet inwardly a sage—is this not the unfathomable numinous? This distinguishes true lead from common lead. If one can know the white and guard the black, the numinous comes of itself.

The wondrous function of the golden elixir lies solely in the metal within water. This passage particularly reveals its symbolic form. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor,"* and the *Awakening to Reality* says: *"Black within holds white—this is the elixir mother."* This is what is meant. Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of metal; the child harbors the mother’s womb. The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent.

As if the great abyss—now sinking, now floating. Withdrawing, they disperse, each guarding its own domain.

Gathered, it resembles white; refined, it becomes vermilion. Tempered into defense, the true dwells within the white.

This passage further points to the dual function of the metal and water apertures, merging two into one. The previous section spoke of metal within water in synthesis; here, it distinguishes the two bodies of metal and water. The essence of metal naturally generates water—it is water’s mother. True metal within *qian* lies concealed within the *kun* water’s envelope, hence: *"the mother conceals the child’s embryo."* This is what the earlier passage meant by *"closing below, it is called absence."*

Water is born of metal—it is metal’s child. True water within *kun* is hidden within the *qian* metal’s frame, hence: *"the child harbors the mother’s womb."* This is what the earlier passage meant by *"closing above, it is called presence."*

When metal and water interact, it is like the *qi* of the two crescents rising on both sides and uniting as one—from this, the true person emerges. The true person resides in the central palace, neither existing nor not existing, numinous and unfathomable. Thus: *"The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent."*

*"As if the great abyss"*—the true person abides in the deep abyss. *"Now sinking, now floating"*—floating and sinking, it guards the compass within. At the moment of metal and water’s union, both dwell in the center. Once united and withdrawn, the true person remains in the middle, while the two again disperse above and below, one south, one north—*"each guarding its own domain."*

Initially, the metal gathered from the northern *kan* is a sheet of pure white. When forged with the true fire of the southern *li*, it suddenly radiates brilliance—is this not *"gathered, it resembles white; refined, it becomes vermilion"*?

Yet this single true seed, neither existing nor not existing, is of the most subtle essence. It must rely on the central yellow *kun* mother to encircle and nurture it, only then can it securely abide in the chamber of spirit, unmoving and unshaken. Thus: *"Tempered into defense, the true dwells within the white."*

This passage speaks of merging two into one, the image of the medicine entering the furnace. It is what was earlier called *"the absent offers to the above, where the numinous dwells."*

Round and square, inch and span—intermingled, they restrain one another. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted. Beside it stand ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle. Encircled and sealed, four paths hesitate. Guarded with utmost secrecy, all treachery is barred. Curved pavilions connect, warding against the unforeseen.

Here, thought may cease; sorrow and toil cannot enter. The chamber brims with spirit and *qi*—none can detain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person.

This section particularly reveals the symbolic form of the furnace and crucible, with the firing process contained therein. Within the Central Yellow Spirit-Chamber, the space spans no more than an inch—round to symbolize Heaven, square to symbolize Earth, and at its center dwells the True Person. Vast and undifferentiated, its shape resembles a hen’s egg. As the *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"Square and round, an inch within lies this place."* Thus it is said: *"Round and square, inch and span—intermingled, they restrain one another."*

This inch-wide space is the Primordial Pass. The Primordial Pass is a single aperture that broadly encompasses the Six Directions, yet subtly penetrates the finest dust. Before Heaven and Earth existed, this aperture was already present, known as the Heaven within Heaven. Within it is stored the Primordial Ancestral *Qi*. Is this not what was called *"born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted"*?

This aperture resides at the very center of Heaven and Earth. To its left and right, the Two Modes divide; above and below, the Three Powers are established. To the left, it connects to the Primordial Gate; to the right, it reaches the Mysterious Portal. Above, it pierces the Celestial Barrier; below, it penetrates the Earthly Axis. Eight-sided and exquisitely wrought, it resembles the isles of Penglai and Fanghu. Is this not what was called *"beside it stand ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle"*?

*"Encircled and sealed, four paths hesitate"* refers to deep roots and firm stems, securely anchoring the Eight Gates to prevent what is within from escaping. *"Guarded with utmost secrecy, all treachery is barred"* means withdrawing the gaze and returning the hearing, shutting out all distractions to prevent what is outside from entering. Though the numinous aperture is interconnected without obstruction, one must still guard against danger and consider risks. Thus it is said: *"Curved pavilions connect, warding against the unforeseen."*

In concentration, the light of awareness is unbroken, yet one must remain at ease and natural. Thus it is said: *"Here, thought may cease; sorrow and toil cannot enter."* Within the Spirit-Chamber, the Primordial Ancestral *Qi* is inherently complete in every person, originally overflowing and abundant. Yet people themselves cannot long retain it. Thus it is said: *"The chamber brims with spirit and *qi*—none can detain it."*

Once the True Person is settled within the Spirit-Chamber, one must attend to it constantly, guarding it at every moment. If even a single moment is neglected, one risks losing it entirely. Thus it is said: *"Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish."*

In this state, one dare not act or rest freely. Instead, one’s every movement and stillness must correspond with the True Person within the Spirit-Chamber—when it moves, one moves with it; when it is still, one is still with it; when it rests, one rests with it. Without forcing or forgetting, continuously and subtly present, the firing process is thereby perfected. Thus it is said: *"In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person."*

This section describes the symbolic form of the furnace and crucible while also encompassing the function of nurturing and refinement. It embodies the operation of *"metal and *qi* mutually assisting one another"* as mentioned earlier. This chapter first reveals the aperture of being and non-being as the true furnace and crucible, then distinguishes the functions of the metal and water *qi* as the true medicine, and finally instructs on the nurturing, protective work of the true firing process. The essentials of the Golden Elixir are fully contained herein—one must not overlook them.

**Chapter Eight: Discerning the True and False**

The method of traversing the viscera judges right and wrong;
Inner contemplation gives rise to thoughts.
Treading the steps of the Dipper’s stars,
The Six Jia follow the days and hours.
The Yin path scorns the nine-and-one,
Defiling and disturbing the primordial womb.
Ingesting *qi* sets the intestines rumbling,
Exhaling the true, inhaling external evil.
Day and night without sleep,
From new moon to dark moon, never resting.
The body grows daily weary,
Bewildered as if in a daze.
The hundred vessels boil and surge,
No moment of clarity or tranquility.
Piling earth to erect altars,
Morning and evening offering reverence.
Ghosts and spirits manifest forms,
Haunting dreams with stirring omens.
The heart rejoices, the mind delights,
Self-assured of extended years—
Yet suddenly death cuts short the lifespan,
The corpse decays, the bones exposed.
Actions ever go awry,
Rebellious and contrary, the pivot is lost.
The arts are myriad,
A thousand strands, ten thousand more,
Advancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old,
Twisting and turning, they stray into the Nine Dark Realms.
The wise heed this meaning,
Vastly perceiving the source of error.

This chapter enumerates the errors of heterodox paths to distinguish true from false. To know the rightness of the Great Dao, one must first examine the wrongness of the side paths.

The methods are countless, their deviations too many to list; here, we briefly outline them:

*"The method of traversing the viscera judges right and wrong; inner contemplation gives rise to thoughts"*—this refers to the heterodox path of visualizing the Five Viscera through forced concentration.

*"Treading the steps of the Dipper’s stars, the Six Jia follow the days and hours"*—this refers to the heterodox path of pacing the Big Dipper’s stars and adhering to talismanic arts.

*"The Yin path scorns the nine-and-one, defiling and disturbing the primordial womb"*—this refers to the heterodox path of "nine shallow, one deep," practicing Yin absorption to supplement Yang.

*"Ingesting *qi* sets the intestines rumbling, exhaling the true, inhaling external evil"*—this refers to the heterodox path of swallowing external *qi* and expelling the old to take in the new.

*"Day and night without sleep, from new moon to dark moon, never resting"*—this refers to the heterodox path of moving essence and circulating *qi*, sitting constantly without lying down.

The above five heterodox paths all seek within the body. Through bizarre and forced practices, their harmful consequences ultimately lead to bodily exhaustion, mental confusion, and the hundred vessels surging uncontrollably, leaving no moment of clarity or tranquility. Such are the pernicious effects of seeking within the body.

*"Piling earth to erect altars, morning and evening offering reverence. Ghosts and spirits manifest forms, haunting dreams with stirring omens"*—this refers to the heterodox path of worshipping and refining ghosts and spirits, which appear in dreams and take shape.

*"The heart rejoices, the mind delights, self-assured of extended years—yet suddenly death cuts short the lifespan, the corpse decays, the bones exposed"*—this heterodox path seeks outside the body. Initially, one offers morning and evening reverence, vainly hoping for ghostly assistance to prolong life. Unaware, one becomes possessed by these spirits, falling into the dark arts of Yin demons. Eventually, one may suffer royal calamity or strange illness, seeking longevity only to meet an early death.

The exposed, decaying corpse becomes the mockery of the vulgar world. Those who seek outside the body meet with such dire consequences. The opening words "right and wrong" run through this entire chapter, declaring that the great Dao of the Golden Elixir lies wholly in nurturing one’s nature—it cannot be confused with these heterodox paths. The work of nurturing nature was already expounded in the two preceding chapters. The heterodox paths run counter to this, thus incurring all manner of calamities: every action and step goes awry, defying the pivot of the Dao and losing its fundamental mechanism.

The arts of these paths are myriad—thousands upon tens of thousands—yet all deviate from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals. The wise heed this meaning and, with clarity, discern the proper course. This passage concludes by exposing how heterodox paths betray the Dao.

The great Dao of the Golden Elixir is none other than nurturing one’s nature, rooted in the Yellow Emperor’s and Laozi’s principle of emptiness and natural spontaneity. Thus, the *Yinfu Jing* and *Daode Jing* directly point to the supreme vehicle of fully realizing nature and destiny, sharing the same pivotal mechanism as the *Yijing* composed by the Three Sages. Yet people, failing to awaken, often stray into heterodox paths. Their movements and choices diverge endlessly, reaching the height of perversity and losing entirely the pivot of the Dao.

The five or six methods listed above—whether sought within the body or beyond it—are but a brief illustration of one corner. Extending this principle, one may infer the myriad strands and countless variations. Generally speaking, if it is not the Yellow Emperor’s and Laozi’s practice of returning to life and reverting to the root, then it is not the profound mystery of the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Palaces and Grotto-Chambers. These practitioners willingly stray onto side paths, like walking backward in search of what lies ahead, expending effort in vain twists and turns. Those with discerning eyes should swiftly arouse faith, seek out a true teacher, and exhaustively investigate the original face of the root-source of nature and destiny. If one can, upon hearing even a single phrase, penetrate the essential teaching, only then will one recognize that there is but one level and unobstructed path, accessible to all. With further dedicated practice—diligently refining and sublimating—one may escape the side paths and transcend to the other shore.

The preceding section (*Lower Scroll, comprising seven chapters on "Subduing and Ingesting"*)—this chapter focuses specifically on "subduing and ingesting," though the governance of vitality and nurturing of nature are already implicit within it. The earlier chapters on governing vitality merely expounded the symbolic patterns of one yin and one yang, while the chapters on nurturing nature merely pointed to the fundamental reality of one nature and one destiny. As for the union of yin and yang, the merging of nature and destiny, there lies a wondrous function. This is why the practice of "subduing and ingesting" serves as the crucial mechanism of the Golden Elixir.

To "subdue" is to employ the mutual restraint of two substances for their function; to "ingest" is to merge two substances into one. It metaphorically uses common lead and mercury as analogies for the true seed of nature and destiny, and borrows the external imagery of the crucible and furnace to allude to the transformative dynamics of body and mind. Manifesting the formless through the formed—this is the essential teaching of "subduing and ingesting." It is not something that can be attained through the heterodox practices of burning reeds or playing with fire.

The medicine within the furnace must be refined with true fire, hence the later chapter speaks of "the affair of the furnace and fire."

**Chapter Nine: The Union of the Two Arcs**

The *Fire Records* are not groundless;
They elucidate the *Yijing* to clarify their meaning.
The crescent models the furnace and crucible,
The White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement;
Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl,
Accompanied by the Green Dragon.
Raising the East to meet the West,
Soul and spirit naturally constrain each other.

The upper arc corresponds to *dui*, numbered eight;
The lower arc to *gen*, also numbered eight.
When the essences of the two arcs unite,
The body of *Qian* and *Kun* is thereby formed.
Two eights make one *jin*—
The Dao of Change stands firm and unshaken.

This chapter directly points to the qi of the golden and watery arcs—first separated, then united—to reveal the true medicine. *"The Fire Records are not groundless; they elucidate the Yijing to clarify their meaning."* The crescent models the furnace and crucible; the White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement. Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl, is accompanied by the Green Dragon. Raising the East to meet the West, soul and spirit naturally constrain each other. This passage designates the true qi of the two arcs as the material for the Golden Elixir.

In the earlier chapters on nurturing nature, only the great Dao of emptiness and natural spontaneity was discussed, without mention of such terms as Dragon, Tiger, lead, or mercury. Only here are these names introduced. The critical operation at the furnace hinges entirely on the two substances of gold and water—termed the furnace and crucible, lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger, the upper and lower arcs. These various metaphors all refer to the same thing.

It is commonly said that the ancient alchemical classics include *Six Hundred Fire Records*, and that Wei Boyang modeled his *Cantong Qi* upon them—this is not the case. The *Fire Records* never existed as a separate text; their content is already present in the primordial *Yijing* of Fu Xi. The sun and moon embody the *Yijing*, nothing more than one yin and one yang. In essence, they belong to *Qian* and *Kun*, while in function, they reside in *Kan* and *Li*. All other names derive from these, with *Qian* and *Kun* representing the symbolic forms of the furnace and crucible, and *Kan* and *Li* representing the symbolic forms of the medicine. The remaining sixty hexagrams and three hundred sixty lines embody the symbolic forms of the firing times. Each day corresponds to two hexagrams, and the cycles of a month precisely match the three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial sphere. When a month is further aligned with a year, it yields the *Six Hundred Fire Records*. Ultimately, it is still the sun and moon embodying the *Yijing*—one yin and one yang, nothing more. Hence it is said: *"The Fire Records are not groundless; they elucidate the Yijing to clarify their meaning."*

*Kan* is the true water of Great Yin, inherently the essence of the moon. Yet it must receive the mandate of the sun. At the conjunction of the dark and new moon, when yin reaches its extreme and turns to yang, the spirit is born within the soul, and true yang arises at the new moon. The fire’s power is still weak; by the third day at dusk, when the first yang stirs in the *geng* direction as *Zhen*, the crescent moon’s inverted arc forms the image of the crescent furnace. Within the water of *Kan*, the essence of metal is produced—this is what is meant by *"the Tiger is born from water."* The metal concealed in the furnace must be refined to emerge, forming the upper arc of *Dui*. Thus it is said: *"The crescent models the furnace and crucible; the White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement."* Here, the furnace and crucible are invoked to encompass the medicine.

*Li* is the true fire of Great Yang, inherently the light of the sun. Yet it must unite with the moon. At the full moon’s opposition, when yang reaches its extreme and turns to yin, the soul generates the spirit, and true yin arises at the full moon. The watery qi remains concealed; by dawn on the sixteenth day, when the first yin descends in the *xin* direction as *Xun*, the moon’s fullness brims, taking the form of flowing pearls. Within the fire of *Li*, the liquid of wood is born—this is what is meant by *"the Dragon emerges from fire."* The nature of wood is to yield to metal, ever inclined to flow downward, forming the lower arc of *Gen*. Thus it is said: *"Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl, accompanied by the Green Dragon."* Here, the medicine is invoked to encompass the furnace and crucible.

Thereupon, the Dragon of the East is driven to meet the Tiger of the West. The flowing pearl and golden essence, as nature and temperament harmonize, the earthly soul and heavenly spirit—metal and wood—naturally restrain each other. Thus it is said: *"Raising the East to meet the West, soul and spirit naturally constrain each other."* This speaks of the wondrous interplay of the two orifices, the mutual embrace of golden qi.

The upper arc of *Dui* is numbered eight; the lower arc of *Gen* is also numbered eight. When the essences of the two arcs unite, the body of *Qian* and *Kun* is thereby formed. Two eights make one *jin*—the Dao of Change stands firm and unshaken. This passage describes the union of the qi of the two arcs to form the Elixir.

From the single yang of *Zhen* and *Geng* rising as a crescent to the two yangs, it belongs to the upper arc of *Dui*. Its hexagram qi receives *Ding*. At this time, the fetal metal within water holds half the soul, and the soul within metal holds half the spirit—this is what is meant by "the upper arc’s metal, half a *jin*." If inverted, it may also be called "water, half a *jin*," hence it is said: *"The upper arc of Dui is numbered eight."*

From the single yin of *Xun* and *Xin* descending as a flowing pearl to the two yins, it belongs to the lower arc of *Gen*. Its hexagram qi receives *Bing*. At this time, the fetal water within metal holds half the soul, and the soul within water holds half the spirit—this is what is meant by "the lower arc’s water, half a *jin*." If inverted, it may also be called "metal, half a *jin*," hence it is said: *"The lower arc of Gen is also numbered eight."*

Previously, the two substances were taken to restrain each other, thus called metal and wood. Here, they are taken as one body generating the other, thus called metal and water. Their use is one and the same.

The body of *Dui* is originally pure *Qian*; with the top line changed to *Kun*’s single yin, it becomes the Youngest Daughter. The body of *Gen* is originally pure *Kun*; with the top line changed to *Qian*’s single yang, it becomes the Youngest Son. Now, when the two sides ascend and unite as one, pure metal returns to *Qian*’s nature, standing within to form the crucible’s enclosure, while pure water returns to *Kun*’s destiny, dwelling without to shape the womb. A single grain of the Golden Elixir is born within the Yellow Earth’s cauldron. Is this not *"When the essences of the two arcs unite, the body of Qian and Kun is thereby formed"*?

Know that at the time of the two arcs, the whole body is already present. Yet when the whole body is attained, the two arcs are no longer seen. The whole body’s union arises naturally, while the two arcs’ division holds wondrous use. This is what is meant by *"The moon’s fullness lies in the oral instruction."*

Once the two arcs unite, lead is but half a *jin*, and mercury only eight *liang*, precisely matching the weight of one *jin* of the Golden Elixir. The complete body of *Qian* and *Kun* is formed from the divided bodies of *Gen* and *Dui*, while the divided bodies of *Gen* and *Dui* emerge from the central bodies of *Kan* and *Li*. The bodies of *Kan* and *Li* are nothing more than the sun and moon. What was previously called *"the sun and moon as Change"* now attains balance, free from the peril of slanting or decline. Thus it is said: *"Two eights make one jin; the Dao of Change stands firm and unshaken."*

It is the use of the postcelestial two arcs to restore the body of the primordial *Qian* metal—this is the true function of the Golden Elixir. This is what is meant by *"elucidating through the Changes,"* the foremost principle of internal alchemy.

**Chapter Ten: Metal Returns to Its Nature**

When metal enters fierce fire,
Its color remains, its radiance undiminished.
Since the world’s opening,
The sun and moon have never lost their brightness.

Metal does not lose its weight,
The sun and moon retain their forms as ever.
Metal is born from the moon,
At dawn it receives the sun’s sign.

Metal returns to its mother,
At the moon’s wane, sun and moon embrace.
Concealing its frame,
It sinks into profound emptiness.

Metal regains its original nature,
Its majestic light blazes within the cauldron.

This chapter directly points to the primordial nature of metal as the foundation of the Elixir’s Dao. The previous chapter addressed the two arcs of metal and water as a dual method; here, the two are merged into one, directly revealing the root of metal’s nature, so that those who cultivate the Dao may know their destination.

Just as worldly true gold, when refined in fierce fire, naturally doubles in radiance without losing its luster, how much more so this original nature of metal, which belongs to the primordial *Qian*, born before heaven and earth, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas—who could steal its radiance? Thus it is said: *"When metal enters fierce fire, its color remains, its radiance undiminished."*

When chaos first split and heaven and earth opened, the single yang within *Qian* broke forth to become *Li*, while the single yin within *Kun* solidified to become *Kan*. *Kan* belongs to the Great Yin, its essence is metal. *Li* belongs to the Great Yang, its light is fire. When the true metal within *Kan* is tempered by the true fire within *Li*, its radiance naturally coalesces and does not scatter. Thus, the sun and moon unite as one body, their light enduring through ancient and modern times without cease. Hence it is said: *"Since the world’s opening, the sun and moon have never lost their brightness."*

When worldly true gold is refined in fierce fire multiple times, its weight never increases or decreases by even a hair’s breadth. How much more so the original nature of metal, which is neither deficient nor excessive? Though it undergoes myriad transformations within the great furnace of *Qian* and *Kun*, its weight remains utterly unchanged. Thus, since the existence of the sun and moon, though they rise and set, wax and wane, enduring countless eclipses, their perfect brightness persists through the ages—only because the nature of metal is indestructible. Therefore it is said: *"Metal does not lose its nature; the sun and moon retain their forms as ever."*

The radiance of metal is fundamentally one, yet the sun and moon each receive a portion. The sun’s light constantly governs external illumination, while the moon’s essence constantly governs internal concealment. Ultimately, the sun and moon are not two bodies, nor are their radiance and essence two things. Though the metal essence within *Kan* seems to reside in the moon, it truly receives its embryo from the sun. People only see that on the third evening, a single yang light suddenly appears from the *Geng* direction, as if metal is born from the moon. Yet they do not know this point of light originally comes from the sun. Only at the meeting of the dark and new moons, when the sun and moon conjoin, does the sun’s spirit reflect upon the moon’s soul, and conception occurs. When at dawn the first yang stirs, the moon’s soul traces back to the sun’s spirit to generate light—*Zhen* arrives to receive the sign. Thus it is said: *"Metal is born from the moon; at dawn it receives the sun’s sign."*

The metal essence within *Kan* originally separated from the *Qian* metal, hence *Qian* is its father. It was also produced from the *Kun* earth, hence *Kun* is its mother. When the moon is at its darkest, it unites with the sun, the two embracing each other. The sun is above, the moon below; the sun’s essence enters the moon, entirely gathered by the Great Yin. The moon’s light is enveloped within the sun, entirely absorbed by the Great Yang. Light is exhausted, the body concealed—utterly dark and without radiance. This is the image of *Kan* metal returning to *Kun* earth.

Thus it is said: *"Metal returns to its mother; at the moon’s darkest, sun and moon embrace."* When metal returns to its mother, the moon is enveloped by the sun, and the yang light retreats, concealing itself in the depths of the northern void—*Xu* and *Wei*—where a single speck of metal essence sinks into the vast emptiness of the North Pole’s Great Abyss. In the workings of creation, this is the union of sun and moon, the celestial mechanism halting its wheel. Within the self, it is the moment when spirit returns to the qi-cavern, the Great Medicine enters the furnace. Thus it is said: *"Conceal its frame, sink into the hollow void."*

Before long, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born anew; the nature of metal revives. At the *Geng* direction, a single yang stirs—within creation, this is the dawn of light; within the self, the Great Medicine is about to emerge, rising from the *Kun* furnace to ascend the *Qian* tripod. Only now does the true metal within *Kan* return to its origin, restoring the nature of its *Qian* father. Radiant, it becomes the elixir, its brilliance illuminating the Great Void. Is this not *"Metal regains its original nature; the tripod’s majestic light blazes forth"*?

This chapter directly points to the nature of metal as the root of creation and the foundation of life. The mystery of creation lies entirely in the *Hetu*: water leads the Five Phases, so Heavenly One generates water. Flowing downward, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and only then does earth generate metal. Metal stands alone at the end, yet it gathers the qi of all Five Phases—thus creation regards metal as its consummation. Earth concludes the Five Phases, so Heavenly Five generates earth. Tracing upward, earth is generated by fire, fire by wood, wood by water, and water by metal. When metal revives, it opens the source of the Five Phases—thus creation also regards metal as its origin. This is the marvel of ending and beginning anew.

Within the self, metal corresponds to the primordial ancestral nature, which, before the union of father and mother, was as vast as the Great Void. After the fusion of essences, the Four Great Elements—earth, water, fire, wind—provisionally combine to form the illusory body. Only when a speck of true nature from the Great Void descends into it can life be established—thus the self regards metal as its origin. When the illusory body composed of the Four Great Elements ultimately perishes, this metal nature alone does not change with it, enduring through ten thousand kalpas—thus the self also regards metal as its consummation. This is the marvel of no beginning and no end.

Long ago, Fuxi composed the *Yijing*, splitting open the Great Ultimate and cleaving the heart of heaven. The first point to descend formed the *Qian* hexagram. *Qian* is heaven, and Confucius glossed it: *"All things rely on it for their beginning."* *Qian* is metal, and Confucius glossed it: *"Pure and refined."* This is the standard for fully realizing one’s nature and fulfilling destiny through the ages. Śākyamuni attained this and manifested a body sixteen feet tall, hence he is revered as the *Golden Immortal*. The Primordial Beginning attained this and coalesced a millet-sized pearl, hence it is treasured as the *Golden Elixir*. The roots of the Three Teachings are one in this metal nature; beyond this, one falls into byways and crooked paths. Those who study the Dao should ponder this deeply.

From the two words "metal nature," one may fathom where the sages of the Three Teachings stand—this truly exhausts the secrets of heaven. From this perspective, the *Cantong Qi* is a book everyone should read, at all times.

**Chapter Eleven: The Full Work of the Two Earths**

*Midnight and noon unite as three; Wu and Ji are called five.*
*Three and five harmonize—eight stones set the norm.*
*Breathing nurtures each other; stillness (thought) becomes husband and wife.*
*Yellow earth is metal’s father; flowing pearl is water’s child.*
*Water treats earth as its ghost—earth subdues water’s rise.*
*Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding balance to adjust gain and loss.*
*When water prevails, fire is extinguished—both die and return to thick earth.*
*The three natures unite, sharing the same ancestral root.*
*Giant fennel still extends years; the returned elixir can be ingested.*
*Metal’s nature never decays—thus it is the treasure of all things.*
*Alchemists refine and consume it, gaining long life.*
*Earth wanders through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.*
*Metal and cinnabar enter the five viscera, mist dispersing like wind and rain.*
*Steaming and permeating the four limbs, complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.*
*Hair turns from white to black; fallen teeth return to their place.*
*The old man regains youth; the aged woman becomes a maiden.*
*Transforming form to escape worldly calamities, one is called a True Person.*

This chapter reveals the work of the Two Earths in creation and elixir formation, showing the essentials of returning to the root.

*Midnight and noon unite as three; Wu and Ji are called five.*
*Three and five harmonize—eight stones set the norm.*
*Breathing nurtures each other; stillness (thought) becomes husband and wife.*

This passage speaks of the two functions of water and fire, which must return to the central earth. The marvelous workings of the elixir path are none other than water and fire; the marvelous workings of water and fire do not depart from *Wu* and *Ji*. Roughly speaking, to mention one is to include two; to mention two is to include three; to unite three is to return to one. Thus, when water and fire achieve balance, their function relies entirely on the true earth of the center.

Water belongs to the due north, the true midnight; within the self, it is the *Kan* *Wu* moon essence, born of Heavenly One, its number one. Fire belongs to the due south, the true noon; within the self, it is the *Li* *Ji* sun radiance, born of Earthly Two, its number two. When these two unite, they form the number three. *Kan* contains *Wu*, which is yang earth; *Li* contains *Ji*, which is yin earth. Within the self, this is the true intention of the central yellow. Earth is born of Heavenly Five, uniquely attaining the number five. Thus it is said: *"Midnight and noon unite as three; Wu and Ji are called five."* United, the three natures are complete.

Water and fire, being of different natures, cannot enter each other. Only by relying on the earth’s virtue of the center, which harmonizes in many ways, can they achieve mutual benefit. Thus, water (one) and fire (two), together with the central earth, form the Four Images, which double into the Eight Trigrams. The four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, arrayed in a circle, form the image of the eight stones.

Is this not the meaning of *"When the three and five harmonize, the eight stones establish the fundamental order"*?

External alchemy aligns the five metals with the Five Phases and the eight stones with the Eight Trigrams. When the elixir head arrives, the five metals and eight stones are all transmuted into true gold. Thus, the immortals borrow external images to illustrate internal work—one must not cling to the images or adhere rigidly to the text.

Once water and fire achieve mutual benefit, their union and separation give rise to the ebb and flow of breath. The exhalation reaches the root, the inhalation reaches the stem, all relying on the true earth of the central palace to contain and nurture them. This breath is not the qi of mouth and nose but the true breath. The true breath moves without interruption, uniting and separating within the central earth, no different from husband and wife in their pairing—this is the true embryo. When the true embryo of the central palace remains unmoving, the one water and one fire naturally breathe within it. Just as the true embryo of the great void remains unmoving, the sun and moon naturally breathe within it. Is this not the meaning of *"Breaths intermingle in nurturance, abiding as husband and wife"*?

This passage directly points to the true breath (original text reads "intention," likely an error) as the mother of the golden elixir. The *Nanhua Jing* states: *"The true person’s breath reaches the heels."* The *Xinyin Jing* states: *"Breath nurtures clarity."* The *Huangting Jing* states: *"Behind lies the secret gate, before the life door; sun emerges, moon enters—breath abides."* All speak of the true breath.

Here, the northern true *zi* is water, the southern true *wu* is fire—this refers to their fundamental nature. Later, the flowing pearl within *Li* is water, the golden essence within *Kan* is fire—this refers to their inverted mutual use.

Yellow earth is the father of metal; the flowing pearl is the child of water. Water treats earth as its ghost—earth subdues water so it does not rise. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding balance to adjust victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; both perish and return to the fertile earth. When the three natures unite, their original nature shares a common ancestor. This verse speaks of the wondrous function of true earth, which unites the three families into one.

The two earths, *Wu* and *Ji*, belong respectively to water and fire. Within water and fire, metal and wood are concealed, yet they never depart from earth. From the moment of receiving qi at birth, the true yellow earth of the center is the source of the golden essence—this metal is originally the ancestral nature of the *Qian* family, the unmoving primordial spirit of the central palace. Only when *Qian*’s metal is broken and flows into *Kun* does it solidify into *Kan*. The golden essence within *Kan* belongs to *Wu* earth—this is the so-called golden flower. Since the golden essence within *Kan* is born of the *Qian* father, it is said: *"Yellow earth is the father of metal."* When *Qian*’s one yang enters *Kan* and is replaced by one yin, it breaks into *Li*—this is *Kun*’s true water transforming into the wooden liquid within *Li*, which belongs to *Ji* earth, the so-called flowing pearl of the great yang. Since the flowing pearl within *Li* emerges from the *Kun* mother, it is said: *"The flowing pearl is the child of water."* This speaks of the three natures following their natural order of generation.

When the three natures follow their natural order, they must arise from the earth of the central palace. When they oppose and restrain one another, they also begin with the earth of the central palace. Thus, the work of the elixir path lies entirely in the true intention. Where thoughts arise is the root of human life and death. Following them leads to endless cycles; reversing them halts the wheel of rebirth. One begins here and returns to the root here.

One must know that the true water within *Li* is called one nature, the true fire within *Kan* is called one nature, and the true earth of the center alone is called one nature. Before their return, they are forcibly divided into three natures; after their return, one realizes that the three natures were originally just one nature. At the very beginning, the Supreme Ultimate contained the three in unity, the undivided heart of heaven and earth. When the primordial chaos was split, water and fire divided into the upper and lower arcs, joining with the central earth to form the three families—this is the process of unity dividing. Later, the qi of the two arcs reunite, the two earths *Wu* and *Ji* dissolve into the center, and they return to a single ancestor. As Zhang Ziyang said: *"Pursue the two qi along the yellow path, unite the three natures in the original palace."* Thus it is said: *"When the three natures unite, their original nature shares a common ancestor."*

First, it speaks of husband and wife in terms of the union of two natures; then, it speaks of father and child in terms of their origin.

The investigation of the ancestral origin ultimately merges into a single nature. Husband and wife are likened to *Kan* and *Li*, father and mother to *Qian* and *Kun*—these form the Two Modes and Four Images. The ancestral origin is likened to the central primordial earth, which is the place of returning to the Supreme Ultimate, the wondrous point of regaining the root and restoring life. *"Sesame may prolong life, but the Returned Elixir can be ingested. The nature of gold does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. Alchemists refine and consume it, and their lifespan attains longevity."* Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules. Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist in wind and rain. It steams and reaches the four limbs, brightening the complexion with radiant beauty. White hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow in their original place. The old man reverts to a youth, the aged woman becomes a maiden. Transforming form to escape worldly calamities, one is called a *Perfected Person*. This passage speaks of the miraculous effects of *fushi* (refining and ingesting the elixir).

When the three natures unite, they form the Golden Elixir; when swallowed, it is called *fushi*. This is entirely distinct from the heterodox practices of consuming medicinal substances. Even common herbs like sesame can prolong life and extend years—how much more so the indestructible, adamantine nature of gold, which endures for ten thousand kalpas? Would it not be the supreme treasure among all things? If Daoist adepts can refine this primordial *qi*, how could their lifespan not be prolonged? *Wu* and *Ji* earths have no fixed position; they circulate through the four seasons. In the east, they become *Chen* earth; in the south, *Wei* earth; in the west, *Xu* earth; in the north, *Chou* earth. Wood, fire, metal, and water are all within the boundaries of earth. When forging the elixir, one relies on this earth to establish the foundation of the central palace; when refining the elixir, one still relies on this earth to stabilize the boundaries of the four directions. Thus it is said: *"Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules."*

Golden sand is the Returned Elixir, formed from the union of two substances. "Entering the five viscera" means entering the mouth, referring to the moment of ingestion—this is not the heterodox practice of consuming medicinal substances. From *"dispersing like mist in wind and rain"* onward, all describe the natural effects after refining the elixir. Once the elixir is swallowed, its numinous transformations are unfathomable. The eighty-four thousand pores of the body seem to billow with clouds and scatter like mist, as if a storm were suddenly upon them. The four limbs are naturally steamed, the complexion naturally radiant. White hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow. The old man becomes a youth again, the old woman a maiden. Neither the cycles of kalpas nor the constraints of creation can restrain them. Though the seas may turn to fields, I remain carefree and at ease—is it not fitting to *"call them Perfected Persons"*?

**Chapter Twelve: Uniting with Like Kind**

When lead powder is cast into fire, its color is destroyed and it returns to lead. When ice and snow meet warm broth, they dissolve into the Supreme Mystery. Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury. Transformation arises from its authenticity; beginning and end follow one another. To become an immortal who refines and ingests the elixir, one must use substances of the same kind. Planting grain requires grain, hatching chicks requires eggs. Assisting nature with like kind makes things easily formed and refined. Can fish eyes be pearls? Can fleabane become catalpa? Like attracts like; disparate things cannot form treasures. Swallows do not hatch phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames, fire does not moisten downward. The world is full of scholars, talented and profound. Yet if they fail to encounter the right opportunity, they waste their fire and squander their resources. Relying on textual interpretation, they recklessly impose their own ideas. Without proper cause or connection, their measures lose control.

Pound and refine chalcanthite, mica, and alum-magnetite.
Sulfur burns the camphorwood, mercury and mud refine each other in flight.
Smelt the Five-Stone Bronze to serve as the pivot’s aid.
Mixed natures of different kinds—how could they dwell as one?
A thousand attempts must end in ten thousand failures; seeking cleverness only breeds folly.
From youth to white-haired age, halfway doubts arise like foxes.
Turning from the Dao to cling to a deluded path, stepping from the straight into crooked byways.
Peering through a tube yields no broad vision—how can one gauge what lies ahead?
Even luck brings no encounter; only the sage truly knows.
This chapter speaks of like kind following like, the only way to refine and ingest the elixir—external alchemy loses its truth.

Lead powder cast into fire, its color ruined, reverts to lead.
Ice and snow met with warm broth dissolve into the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from its truth, beginning and end naturally follow one another.
This passage rightly speaks of water and fire, like kind transforming to form the elixir.

What is like kind?
People know only that *Kan* is water, yet do not know that the single yang within *Kan* originally comes from the *Qian* household—it is precisely the true fire of the Great Yang.
Yang and yang are of like kind, thus the true fire within *Kan* ever strives to blaze upward and return to *Qian*.
People know only that *Li* is fire, yet do not know that the single yin within *Li* originally comes from the *Kun* palace—it is precisely the true water of the Great Yin.
Yin and yin are of like kind, thus the true water within *Li* ever strives to descend and return to *Kun*.
This is the meaning of the *Great Change*: “Water flows to the moist, fire moves to the dry.”
That which originates in heaven inclines upward; that which originates in earth inclines downward—each follows its own kind.

The Master first illustrates with worldly examples:
Lead powder, though refined from black lead, upon meeting fire immediately reverts to lead.
Ice and snow, though congealed from cold water, upon meeting broth instantly dissolve into water.
Thus fire returns to fire, water returns to water—original nature cannot be violated.
Those who refine the golden elixir take only the gold within water; the gold within water is the root of life, originally issuing from the *Qian* nature.
From *Qian* it breaks into *Li*; *Li* is the root of essence, containing true yin, receiving the fire-qi of the southern direction—this is the image of cinnabar.
The adept seeking to understand the lineage of life must take essence as the master.
Thus it is said: “Gold takes cinnabar as its master.”
Yet this cinnabar within *Li*, when met with fire, flies upward and is not easily subdued—it still relies on the gold within the northern water to restrain it.
The adept seeking to understand the lineage of essence must take life as the foundation.
Thus it is said: “Harmonizing with mercury.”
Know that cinnabar and mercury are originally one body, differing only in name.
At first, they transform from one body into two things; in the end, they must transform from two things back into one.
Only this true yin and true yang, of like kind, interact and mutually serve.
Thus it is said: “Transformation arises from its truth, beginning and end naturally follow one another.”
The method of transformation is nothing more than flowing *wu* to *ji*, inverting host and guest, so that the postnatal *Kan* and *Li* return to the prenatal *Qian* and *Kun*.
As Zhang Ziyang said: “Yin and yang, when of like kind, interact; the two eights, when matched, naturally unite”—this is the meaning.
To become an immortal who refines and ingests the elixir, one must use substances of the same kind.
Planting grain requires grain, hatching chicks requires eggs.
Assisting nature with like kind makes things easily formed and refined.
Can fish eyes be pearls? Can fleabane become catalpa?
Like attracts like; disparate things cannot form treasures.
Swallows do not hatch phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames, fire does not moisten downward.
This passage provides further evidence for the principle of like kind.

The method of *fushi* (elixir refinement and ingestion) relies solely on cinnabar and mercury, transforming these two substances into the elixir. Gold restrains cinnabar—this is the meaning of *fu* (subduing). Swallowing it into the five viscera—this is the meaning of *shi* (ingestion). Without *fushi*, there is no way to become an immortal; without substances of the same kind, there is no way to refine and ingest them. Thus it is said: “To become an immortal who refines and ingests the elixir, one must use substances of the same kind.” These two lines are the key to the entire passage, and all the subsequent analogies and metaphors serve to elucidate the two characters *tonglei* (of like kind). Every sentient and insentient being in the world belongs to its own kind. When things of the same kind come together, it is like planting grain with grain or hatching chicks with eggs—their *qi* naturally assists one another, so that things are easily transformed and refined. If disparate things are forcibly combined, it is like fish eyes that cannot become pearls, fleabane that cannot become catalpa, swallows that cannot hatch phoenixes, or foxes and hares that cannot nurse horses. Their natures are entirely distinct, inevitably leading to discord and making it impossible to form treasures. Moreover, water by nature flows toward moisture and tends downward—once it flows, it cannot be forced upward. Fire by nature seeks dryness and tends upward—once it moves, it cannot be forced downward. This is why *Kan* and *Li* each follow their own kind, and why cinnabar and mercury transform into the elixir. This is the meaning of *fushi*.

Many scholars in the world possess lofty talent and refined skill. Yet if they fail to encounter the proper method, they waste their fire and squander their resources. Relying on texts alone, they arbitrarily impose their own interpretations. Without a clear thread of principle, their measures and efforts go astray.

Pound and refine chalcanthite, mica, and alum-magnetite;
Roast brimstone with camphorwood, blend clay with mercury and sublimate.
Smelt the Five Minerals into bronze, using them as auxiliary pivots.
Yet disparate natures reject kinship—how could they ever unite in one body?
A thousand attempts must end in ten thousand failures; seeking cleverness, one becomes a fool.
From youth to white-haired age, doubt arises midway.
Turning from the Dao to cling to deluded paths, one strays from the straight way into crooked byways.
Peering through a tube, one’s vision is too narrow to gauge what lies ahead.
Though one may hope for luck, the encounter never comes—only the sage truly knows.
This passage thoroughly exposes the fallacies of furnace-and-fire theories:
All that possesses form and substance is not the true essence of kindred nature.

To refine the Returned Elixir, one must gather the proper medicinal substances—
those of singular nature and life, inherently formless and wondrous in their primordial state,
metaphorically called "lead" and "mercury," yet utterly unlike common cinnabar or quicksilver.
To refine the Returned Elixir, one must establish the furnace and tripod,
place the medicinal substances within, and employ primordial true fire for forging—
metaphorically called "furnace and fire," yet utterly unlike burning thatch or playing with flames.
The work of the Returned Elixir relies entirely on the fire-phase for refinement,
followed by gentle nurturing, culminating in transformation.
When a single grain is perfected, it sheds its husk and enters the mouth—
metaphorically called "subdued ingestion," yet utterly unlike consuming metallic or mineral concoctions.

Yet the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas,
and moreover, worldly beings, lacking sufficient fortune, seldom meet a true master.
Thus, many drift into false arts.
There are reckless men who, proud of their talents and erudition,
refuse to seek guidance from a true teacher, arbitrarily imposing their own interpretations
and misconstruing the alchemical classics.
They mistake common minerals for "lead" and "mercury,"
take mere smelting for "furnace and fire,"
and regard ingestion of substances as "subdued ingestion."
Ignorant of the proper thread and measure,
they amass the Five Metals and Eight Minerals,
indiscriminately employing the Three Yellows and Four Spirits.
Since these are not inherently kindred substances, how could they ever unite to form an elixir?
It is like mistaking a fish’s eye for a pearl or expecting a fox or hare to give birth to a horse.
Such false arts inevitably lead to ten thousand failures for every thousand attempts,
leaving one with no achievement even in old age.

Minor harms drain one’s wealth and resources, while greater ones cost body and life. Seemingly clever yet truly foolish, they cling to doubt yet embrace falsehood—persisting in delusion, turning from the Dao, straying from orthodoxy into heterodoxy. Unwilling to admit their own errors, they instead misdirect others onto wrong paths. With the narrow vision of "viewing the sky through a tube or measuring the sea with a gourd," they write books and establish doctrines, misleading future generations, blocking the paths of those to come, and blinding the eyes of later seekers. When examined through the Dharma-eye, not a single truth remains in their teachings. Yet such individuals remain oblivious, still hoping for a one-in-ten-thousand stroke of luck—how utterly absurd!

The first chapter reveals the true qi of the two celestial arcs; the second chapter uniquely uncovers the precelestial metal-nature; the third chapter then speaks of the convergence of the three natures. Only then does the elixir enter the mouth, the rank of true person is attained, and the essence of subdued ingestion is fully expounded without residue. Yet世人, deluded by the collateral arts of smelting and refinement, often falsely claim "subdued ingestion" while using substances that are not of the same kind. Thus, this chapter reiterates its warnings to shatter their illusions.

Master Lü’s admonitory verse declares:
*"Not realizing the elixir of return originally has no form,
They foolishly ingest metals and minerals instead!"*
Left implicit yet unspoken—does this not embody the immortal elder’s intent to dispel delusion?

**Chapter Thirteen: Following the Teachings of the Three Sages**

As for the three sages, they culminate in Fuxi, who first drew the eight trigrams, modeling them on Heaven and Earth. King Wen, of imperial lineage, structured their forms and composed the line statements. Confucius, the near-sage and hero, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords were raised by Heaven, succeeding one another to govern their eras. Though their steps differed in excellence, their merit and virtue were not disparate. Their creations followed in succession, their calculations precise down to the smallest fraction. What has form is easily measured, but what leaves no trace is difficult to plan. Their deeds set models for emulation, and for the world they established these *Classic of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*. Possessing no innate faculty of foresight, they awakened through the guidance of teachers.

As if lifting the hem of a gauze curtain, eyes blazing as one ascends the high terrace. The *Fire Records* span six hundred chapters, yet their intent differs not at all. The texts expound with solemn gravity, yet the world fails to ponder deeply. Tracing their origins and currents, the hidden and the manifest originally dwell as one. I dare not speak lightly of this for the worthy, nor dare I take writing lightly. If I were to seal my tongue in silence, cutting off the Way would incur the crime of execution. Yet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk risks leaking the celestial tally. Wavering, I sigh repeatedly, bowing my head to stitch together this folly.

There are methods and measures to refinement, yet how could all be fully expounded? I shall briefly outline the essential framework, where branches and leaves appear in luxuriant profusion.

This chapter speaks of following the three sages’ *Changes* to elucidate the great Dao.

As for the three sages, they were none other than Fuxi, who first drew the eight trigrams, modeling them on Heaven and Earth. King Wen, of imperial lineage, structured their forms and composed the line statements. Confucius, the near-sage and hero, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords were raised by Heaven, succeeding one another to govern their eras. Though their steps differed in excellence, their merit and virtue were not disparate. Their creations followed in succession, their calculations precise down to the smallest fraction. What has form is easily measured, but what leaves no trace is difficult to plan. Their deeds set models for emulation, and for the world they established this *Book of Changes*.

This passage speaks of the three sages’ creation of the *Changes* as the wellspring of the great Dao.

The body of the Dao is one with the Great Void, fundamentally without name or image. Before the remote antiquity, all was a chaotic undifferentiated whole—oblivious to the Dao, yet nothing was not the Dao! Only after the sages created the *Changes* was this chaos cleaved open, and all celestial mechanisms fully revealed.

The *Book of Changes* began with Fuxi’s drawing of the trigrams, King Wen’s composition of the line statements, and Confucius’ completion of the Ten Wings. Only after these three sages did the Dao of the *Changes* become complete. Fuxi, the sage who opened Heaven, held the cosmos in his grasp and the myriad transformations in his heart. At that time, he observed the heavens above and the earth below, exhaustively grasping the root of creation. Heaven did not withhold the Dao, and thus the Yellow River brought forth the *Chart*, and the Luo River the *Script*, serving as verification. From this, he clearly perceived that the root of creation was but the Supreme Ultimate, and the essence of the Supreme Ultimate was contained within the *River Chart* and *Luo Script*. Within the River and Luo, the Five is the Supreme Ultimate! From this, one yin and one yang divided to form the Two Modes, from the Two Modes arose the Four Images, and from the Four Images arose the Eight Trigrams.

Once the eight trigrams were drawn, their sequence was: Qian as one, Dui as two, Li as three, Zhen as four, Xun as five, Kan as six, Gen as seven, and Kun as eight. Qian marks the origin, Kun the culmination, the two encompassing yin and yang. Zhen is the root of Heaven, Xun the cavern of the Moon. From their midst, creation unfolds. Their positions are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, Kan in the west, Dui in the southeast, Gen in the northwest, Xun in the southwest, and Zhen in the northeast. The pure and centered yin and yang occupy the four cardinal directions, while the mixed and peripheral occupy the four corners. Heaven is positioned above, Earth below, Qian and Kun fixing the positions of noon and midnight. The sun rises in the east, the moon in the west, Kan and Li arrayed at the gates of dawn and dusk. Mountains stabilize the northwest, marshes flow to the southeast, wind arises in the southwest, and thunder resounds in the northeast—all conforming to the natural patterns of creation.

When doubled into sixty-four hexagrams, their sequence and positions remain largely the same. Before the trigrams were drawn, the *Changes* resided in Heaven and Earth; once the trigrams were drawn, Heaven and Earth resided in the *Changes*. This is what is meant by “modeling them on Heaven and Earth.” This is the *Changes* of Fuxi’s Primordial Heaven.

The *Changes* of Primordial Heaven established its structure but did not exhaust its application. Later, the *Lianshan* began with Gen, and the *Guicang* with Kun. Though the *Changes* of the Xia and Shang each had their uses, their profound meanings were not yet manifest. By the transition from Shang to Zhou, King Wen endured imprisonment in Youli, his person experiencing hardship, and the great application appeared before him. He then reversed Fuxi’s configuration, inverting the transformative mechanisms of Qian and Kun. In their positions, Li fire moved from east to south, replacing Qian’s position, for Qian’s great application lies in Li, the image of turning toward the light. Kan water moved from west to north, replacing Kun’s position, for Kun’s great application lies in Kan, the place of hidden utility. Zhen wood, originally in the northeast, advanced to the east to replace Li, for wood and fire are companions. Dui metal, originally in the southeast, retreated to the west to replace Kan, for metal and water are allies. Qian the father was moved to the northwest, placed before Kan water, embodying Qian’s meaning of knowing the great beginning. Kun the mother was placed in the southwest, positioned behind Li fire, embodying Kun’s meaning of completing things. Gen came to the northeast, occupying the position of Zhen in Primordial Heaven, where the eldest son becomes the youngest, yang having advanced to its limit and then retreating. Xun went to the southeast, occupying the position of Dui in Primordial Heaven, where the youngest daughter becomes the eldest, yin having retreated to its limit and then advancing. The young and intermingling yin and yang occupy the four cardinal directions, while the old and unmingling occupy the four corners. The meaning is taken from *jiaoyi* (exchange) as application. The sequence of the eight trigrams thus begins with “The Lord emerges from Zhen” and ends with “Completion is spoken in Gen,” cycling endlessly, beginning and ending the myriad things. The meaning is taken from *bianyi* (transformation) as application. The sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams begins with Qian and Kun, centers on Kan and Li, and concludes with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. The meaning is taken from *fandui* (opposition) as application.

Once the positions were altered, the images were appended with statements. Those attached to the hexagrams are called *tuan* statements, such as “originating, prospering, benefiting, and persevering.” Those attached to each line are called *yao* statements, such as “the hidden dragon does not act.” The images and prognostications are brilliantly complete—this is what is meant by “structuring their forms and composing the line statements.” This is the *Changes* of the Later Heaven of the Zhou.

Confucius, born after the sages, developed a fondness for the *Changes* in his later years, wearing out the leather bindings of his bamboo scrolls three times. Its meanings grew ever more refined.

The Ten Wings were composed to serve as the feathers and wings of the sacred classic. The *Xiang*, *Tuan*, and *Wenyan* commentaries exclusively expound the line statements of King Wen’s Later Heaven arrangement, while the *Xici*, *Shuogua* also elucidate the images of Fu Xi’s Earlier Heaven. The *Xugua* and *Zagua* reveal the marvels of interconnected resonance and the dynamic mechanism of opposition. Within them lie the profound words of "fulfilling one’s nature to reach destiny," the arcane principles of "exhausting the divine and knowing transformation"—nothing is left unaddressed. This is what is meant by "the Ten Wings to assist it." They guide people from the Later Heaven back to the Earlier Heaven, and thus the Dao of the *Changes* attains its fullest completion.

The Three Sages were all endowed by Heaven, arising in succession to illuminate the great Dao. Though their compositions and transmissions followed in sequence, their merit and virtue admit no hierarchy. Fu Xi’s *Changes* drew from the workings of creation; King Wen’s *Changes* drew from Fu Xi; Confucius’s *Changes* drew from both Fu Xi and King Wen. Whether composing or transmitting, they stemmed from a single source, their distinctions finer than a hair’s breadth. The formless pertains to the Dao of the metaphysical—this is the Supreme Ultimate. The formed pertains to the implements of the physical—these are the hexagrams, lines, images, and numbers. The metaphysical Dao is difficult to fathom, while the physical implements are easier to ponder. Thus, by drawing the hexagrams, appending the line statements, and composing the Wings, the Dao of the interplay of yin and yang is fittingly embodied within.

The Three Sages established this book of the *Changes* precisely so that generations of Dao-seeking scholars might model themselves upon its images. Those without prior understanding rely on teachers to awaken. It is as if lifting the curtain to gaze from a high terrace—bright and clear. The *Six Hundred Fire Records* share the same aim, yet their texts are solemnly expounded, while the world fails to reflect deeply upon them.

Tracing its source and flow, the hidden and the manifest originally dwell as one. How dare I, in addressing the worthy, treat the writing of this lightly? Yet if I seal my tongue in silence, I would sever the Way and incur condemnation. To commit my thoughts to bamboo and silk, I fear, would leak the celestial tally. Wavering, I sigh; bowing and raising my head, I string together these foolish words.

Refinement has its methods—how could I exhaustively set them forth? I shall briefly outline its warp and woof, that its branches and leaves may appear in luxuriant array. This passage speaks of modeling the *Can Tong Qi* upon the *Changes*, directly recounting its source and flow.

The Wei Lord himself declared that the Great Dao is not transmitted without a true teacher. Even the heaven-endowed Three Sages, in their compositions, followed in the footsteps of others—how could I, lacking any prior endowment of knowledge, presume to advance the Great Dao on my own? Fortunate to have encountered a true teacher and awakened, my long-standing obstructions dissolved, my doubts melted like ice, and my eyes became luminously clear, as if lifting the curtain to ascend a high terrace—how joyous!

The *Changes* contains sixty-four hexagrams. Excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, which correspond to the furnace, tripod, and medicinal substances, the remaining hexagrams proceed at two per day—Zhun in the morning and Meng in the evening. A month of thirty days accords with sixty hexagrams; ten months of three hundred days accord with six hundred hexagrams. Ultimately, the years are gathered into months, the months into days, the days into hours—all the work of firing and timing resides in a single moment. Though the text is solemnly expounded, its purport is no different; there are not truly six hundred *Fire Records*.

Alas, the world fails to study deeply or ponder the source and flow. If one could but investigate, this single Kan and Li—dark moon and bright sun, kindred dwelling together, sun and moon as the *Changes*, penetrating day and night—would be the supreme, most wondrous Dao. Now that I have awakened through my teacher, I see clearly that the Dao lies before me. I may only discuss it with one or two worthy ones; I dare not lightly commit it to writing. Yet to seal my mouth and bind my tongue would truly risk defying the heavenly Dao and incurring reproach. To fully inscribe it on bamboo and silk, I fear, would leak the celestial treasure and invite transgression.

Caught between advance and retreat, wavering and bowing, I can only borrow the images of the *Changes* to convey the formless workings of the Great Elixir. After exhausting all refinement, I roughly set forth the warp: the tripod, the medicinal substances, and the broad outlines. I gather the firing and tempering, faintly revealing the branches. This is to aid later learners in grasping the meaning and forgetting the words. For writing does not exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning.

The *Can Tong Qi* of the Immortal Elder truly aligns with the Three Sages’ *Changes* in its aim to fully realize nature, reach destiny, and fathom the divine and comprehend transformation—as if tallying halves. Those in the world who are destined to meet a teacher will, upon encountering this single verification, attain clarity!

**Chapter Fourteen: The Law and Image of the Returned Elixir**

With metal as the embankment, water enters and flows freely.
The number of metal is fifteen; the number of water is the same.
Before the furnace, fix the weights and measures—
five parts water, with a surplus.
Take these two as the true,
the metal’s weight as in its origin.
The earth (three) then does not depart (enters),
the two (fire) accompanying it.
The three substances mutually contain and receive,
their transformations appearing divine.
Below lies the qi of Grand Yang,
steaming and seething in an instant.
First liquid, then congealing,
it is called the Yellow Chariot.
When years and months draw to an end,
one’s nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed.
The body becomes like ash and earth,
its form like dust in a bright window.
Pound, refine, and combine them,
then hold and enter the vermilion gate.
Securely seal their junctures,
striving to make them whole and firm.

Flames blaze below,
the Dragon and Tiger’s cries ceaseless day and night.
At first, the civil is cultivated;
in the end, the martial is accomplished.
Observe with utmost care,
scrutinizing the balance of cold and warmth.
Cycle through the twelve nodes,
and when each is complete, draw closer still.
Qi wanes, life nears its end,
body dies, and soul departs.
The hue shifts to purple,
brilliant—this is called the Returned Elixir.
Ground to a single pellet,
the spatula’s touch is most divine.

This passage fully presents the symbolic method of the Returned Elixir,
serving as the standard for entering the chamber.

Use metal as the embankment,
so water may enter with ease.
The metal’s number is fifteen,
the number of water is the same.
Before the furnace, fix the weights and measures—
five parts water, with a surplus.
Take these two as the true,
the metal’s weight as in its origin.
The earth then does not depart,
the two accompanying it.

This section speaks of the two qi of metal and water as the true seed of the Golden Elixir.
Indeed, the wondrous work of the Returned Elixir, from beginning to end,
lies solely in these two—metal and water.
When established, they become the furnace and cauldron;
when gathered, they become the medicine;
when refined, they become the fire-timing.
Even in withdrawal, addition, and transformation,
all operations depend on them.
Yet the Daoist adept must know the order of precedence—
without first establishing the embankment, one cannot employ metal and water.

The metal within Kan (Water) is originally concealed within,
yet what is within must emerge.
In the work of the Golden Elixir, one must first establish the embankment,
firmly sealing the six gates so the primordial qi does not leak outward.
The water within Li (Fire) easily overflows without,
yet what is without must enter.
Once the embankment is set, overflow is forbidden,
true essence no longer escapes, and naturally flows into the furnace with ease.
Thus it is said: *"Use metal as the embankment, so water may enter with ease."*

Within the two substances of metal and water lie the two earths, Wu and Ji.
The generating number of earth is five, its completing number ten.
The metal within Kan embraces Wu—this is its five of the ten.
The water within Li embraces Ji—this is also its five of the ten.
The two earths combine to form the *gui*,
the qi of the two phases perfectly rounding and fulfilling.
Thus it is said: *"The metal’s number is fifteen, the number of water is the same."*

Once the embankment is set, one may proceed to the furnace.
In the furnace’s pairing, it is still the two—metal and water—
but their weights and measures must not err by even a hair.
True water and true metal must be perfectly balanced,
neither in excess nor deficient.
Thus water is limited to five parts,
guarding against overflow—it must not be excessive.
Metal must also be five parts,
its weight as in its original measure—it must not be deficient.
When metal and water attain their truth,
true earth naturally harmonizes between them.
For within Li, Ji is embraced—its five parts of water are Ji earth;
within Kan, Wu is embraced—its five parts of metal are Wu earth.
Thus, in the two substances of metal and water, true earth is already present.
When Wu and Ji earths converge at the center,
they too attain their five-part base number,
the three families meeting to complete the three and five.
Thus it is said: *"The earth then does not depart, the two accompanying it."*

The meaning of the three and five derives from the *Hetu*:
east three and south two, wood and fire as companions;
north one and west four, metal and water as friends.
Here, only metal and water are mentioned, not wood and fire,
for metal and water are essence and spirit, like a person’s form.
Wood and fire are spirit and soul, like a person’s shadow.
When the form moves, the shadow follows—never apart, step by step.
So too are wood and fire with metal and water.
When essence and spirit unite and transform,
spirit and soul likewise attain wondrous union.
Such is the marvel of the Golden Elixir’s creation.

The three substances mutually contain and receive,
their transformations appearing divine.
Below lies the qi of Grand Yang,
steaming and seething in an instant.
First liquid, then congealing,
it is called the Yellow Chariot.
When years and months draw to an end,
one’s nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed.
The body becomes like ash and earth,
its form like dust in a bright window.

This section describes the union of Kan and Li, the symbolic method of the Golden Elixir.
The qi of the two phases—metal and water—are nurtured by true earth,
becoming the three substances of one family.
Within them, transformations arise,
their divine workings unfathomable.
Once the embankments fore and aft are firmly set,
allowing no leakage, the true qi in the furnace naturally stirs.
Then the yang within Kan is drawn to fill the yin within Li.
The true fire of Grand Yang in the Northern Sea steams upward,
and in an instant, the true water of Li Palace responds,
first turning to white liquid, then congealing to utmost firmness.
The two unite in the Yellow Chamber, revolving without cease,
forming the image of the Yellow Chariot.
As it is said: *"The Infant and the Maiden emerge together,
only to be led into the chamber by the Yellow Dame."*

Yet before these two unite, one must guide them with true intent;
after their union, one must guard them with true intent.
A speck of yang qi gathers into thick earth,
life’s mechanism turning to destruction—
like the depths of winter, when all things wither and return to the root.
Thus it is said: *"When years and months draw to an end, one’s nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed."*
At first, spirit enters qi, motionless and still,
like withered wood or dead ashes.
In time, life’s mechanism stirs again,
a speck of true qi faint and indistinct, rising like mist—
like wild horses or dust motes.
Thus it is said: *"The body becomes like ash and earth, its form like dust in a bright window."*
This is the symbolic image of Kan and Li’s first union,
the Great Medicine about to be born.

Pound, refine, and combine them,
then hold and enter the vermilion gate.
Securely seal their junctures,
striving to make them whole and firm.
Flames blaze below,
the Dragon and Tiger’s cries ceaseless.

At first, the civil fire enables refinement;
in the end, the martial fire achieves completion.
Observe with utmost care,
examining closely to regulate warmth and coolness.
Cycle through the twelve nodes,
and when each node concludes, attend to it anew.
When qi is exhausted and life nears its end,
the body dies, and the hun and po dissolve.
Its hue shifts to deepest purple—
brilliant, it is called the Returned Elixir.
Ground to a single pellet,
the *daogui* is most divine.

This passage describes the symbolic image of Qian and Kun’s union,
the method of the Returned Elixir.
Once Kan and Li have conjoined within the Yellow Chamber,
the two substances are fused and refined into one,
nurtured within the Kun furnace.
When the time arrives, the Great Medicine is born—
what is called *"the lead of the Water Realm, but a single flavor."*
Once the Great Medicine emerges, hasten to gather it,
using true intent as the medium,
revolving the wind to blend them,
slowly ascending from the Kun furnace into the Qian tripod,
where it condenses into the Elixir.
Thus it is said: *"Pound, refine, and combine them,
then hold and enter the vermilion gate."*
These two lines encompass countless acts of absorption, licking, gathering, and sealing.
The vermilion gate is the Crimson Palace, the Qian tripod.
Once the medicine ascends into the tripod,
it gradually congeals and coalesces,
then is slowly drawn downward from the Qian tripod
and returned to the Yellow Court.
At this moment, employ the method of firm sealing,
deepening and securing it further,
until emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its fullness—
only then will the single speck of true yang qi not leak away.
Thus it is said: *"Securely seal their junctures,
striving to make them whole and firm."*
When sealing is absolute,
a single yang stirs beneath the Nine Earths,
bursting forth like a raging fire breaking through a barrier.
At the precise midnight hour, swiftly apply the true fire in response.
In an instant, Qian and Kun open and close,
Dragon and Tiger contend,
and the cries of dragon and tiger resound.
Thus it is said: *"Flames blaze below,
the Dragon and Tiger’s cries ceaseless."*

When the Great Medicine first arises,
use the civil fire to nurture it,
so it may ascend and emerge from the furnace.
Once the Great Medicine is born,
use the martial fire to forge it,
so it may coalesce into a treasure and return to the tripod.
Thus it is said: *"At first, the civil fire enables refinement;
in the end, the martial fire achieves completion."*
In this process, the firing times must not err by even a hair’s breadth.
If civil fire is misapplied with excess vigor, the flames will burn too fiercely.
If martial fire is misapplied with insufficient strength, the flames will grow too cold.
One must gauge the proper balance of gentleness and intensity,
adjusting the rhythm of warmth and coolness,
to achieve the mean.
Thus it is said: *"Observe with utmost care,
examining closely to regulate warmth and coolness."*

At midnight, kindle the fire from the *weilu*,
responding to the first stirring of yang in the *Fu* hexagram—
this is the Root of Heaven.
Continue until the six yang lines fill Qian,
where motion reaches its peak and reverts to stillness.
At noon, withdraw the fire from the *niwan*,
responding to the first stillness of yin in the *Gou* hexagram—
this is the Grotto of the Moon.
Continue until the six yin lines fill Kun,
where stillness reaches its peak and reverts to motion.
Thus it is said: *"Cycle through the twelve nodes,
and when each node concludes, attend to it anew."*
This is the symbolic image of the great union of Qian and Kun.
Motion and stillness generate each other in endless cycles.
Refine ceaselessly, day by day drawing forth lead and adding mercury.
Over time, lead is exhausted and mercury dries,
yin wanes as yang waxes,
until conditioned nature is transformed into true nature,
and the spirit of consciousness into the primordial spirit.
When the dregs of yin are fully purged,
the breath of the corpse vanishes and the root of life severs;
when the yang spirit takes form,
the mortal body dies and the hun and po dissolve.
Thus it is said: *"When qi is exhausted and life nears its end,
the body dies, and the hun and po dissolve."*
This is the moment Guan Yinzi spoke of: *"When not a single breath remains,
the Dao will come to meet you."*

With prolonged refinement,
after extinction comes revival,
the heart dies and the spirit lives,
and the Elixir within the tripod becomes full and luminous,
filling the great void.
Is this not *"Its hue shifts to deepest purple—
brilliant, it is called the Returned Elixir"*?
The Golden Elixir originates from the Qian household,
and returns to Qian—hence it is called the Returned Elixir.
Its color turns purple through the forging of water and fire qi.
The Returned Elixir has qi but no form,
no different from a pellet of powder or a *daogui* of seven parts—
yet its transformations are as divine as this.
From here, one sheds the womb and changes the tripod,
recreating Qian and Kun.
The child gives birth to grandchildren,
transformations beyond measure.
Beyond this point, none can know what lies ahead.
Is this not *"Ground to a single pellet,
the *daogui* is most divine"*?
The *dao* is the metal within water;
the *gui* is the two earths of *wu* and *ji*.
Thus, from beginning to end,
it is only through the transformations of metal, water, and earth
that the Returned Elixir is formed.
As Master Cui’s *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says:
*"Drink the *daogui*, glimpse the workings of heaven."*
And Lüzu’s *Spring in Qin Garden*:
*"At that time, I drank the *daogui* myself—
who would believe a child was born from nothing?"*
Their meanings are much the same.

This chapter fully reveals the symbolic image of the Returned Elixir,
a pivotal passage in the section on internal alchemy.
First, it speaks of the union of the two substances,
where qi is subdued in the Kun furnace to produce the medicine.
Then, it speaks of the first stirring of yang,
where the spirit is congealed in the Qian tripod to form the Elixir.
The first two sections describe the workings of the Golden Elixir,
while the latter section describes the workings of the Returned Elixir.
As *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says:
*"Born in Kun, planted in Qian."*
And *Awakening to Reality*:
*"Relying on Kun’s position to form the body,
planted in Qian’s Palace of Mutual Response."*
Both draw from this chapter.
*Chapter Fifteen: The Meaning of the Returned Elixir.*

Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise yet not cumbersome.
Raising water to douse fire, suddenly extinguishes its radiance.
Sun and moon mutually eclipse,
ever at the juncture of the dark and new moon.
When water prevails, Kan encroaches upon yang;
when fire wanes, Li dims the day.
Yin and yang consume one another,
their interaction the natural Way.

Names fix their essence,
characters speak of their nature.
When metal returns to the origin of nature,
only then is it called the Returned Elixir.
I dare not speak idly,
but emulate the writings of the sages.
Ancient records depict the Dragon and Tiger,
the Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flowers.
Huainan refined Autumn Stone,
Yuyang added the Yellow Sprout.
The worthy may uphold and practice this,
the unworthy must not partake.
The Dao of past and present is one,
our discourse reveals its counsel.
Scholars, exert yourselves further,
reflect deeply and ponder.
The essential words are fully revealed,
lucid and never deceiving.

This chapter concludes that the meaning of the Returned Elixir lies solely in the nature and essence of water and fire.

Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise yet not cumbersome.
Raising water to douse fire, suddenly extinguishes its radiance.
Sun and moon mutually eclipse,
ever at the juncture of the dark and new moon.
When water prevails, Kan encroaches upon yang;
when fire wanes, Li dims the day.
Yin and yang consume one another,
their interaction the natural Way.

This section speaks of the interaction of water and fire—though mutable, it does not lose its constancy.
The essence of the Elixir Way lies in nothing more than one water and one fire.
Water and fire originally emerge from a single source, later dividing into two substances.
Within Qian, a single yang flees into the Kun palace to form Kan, where the true fire of Great Yang resides.
Within Kun, a single yin turns into the Qian palace to form Li, where the true water of Great Yin resides.
The two qi of water and fire mutually conceal their roots, transforming endlessly, the Five Phases fully contained within.
Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, and metal in turn generates water—
a leftward cycle of mutual generation, the forward sequence of the River Chart.
Fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and water in turn overcomes fire—
a rightward cycle of mutual conquest, the reverse sequence of the Luo Book.
One forward, one reverse; one generation, one conquest—
the myriad transformations of the Five Phases never exceed this scope.
Thus it is said: *"Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases, it is concise yet not cumbersome."*

Heavenly One generates water, water being true yang, yet it falls into the Great Yin of the north, so water is ascribed to yin.
Earthly Two generates fire, fire being true yin, yet it rises to the position of Great Yang in the south, so fire is ascribed to yang.
When yin prevails, it encroaches upon yang;
when water prevails, it can extinguish fire.
For the formless water and fire of the primordial state, their function is mutual support.
For the formed water and fire of the later state, their function is mutual conflict.
Thus it is said: *"Raising water to douse fire, suddenly extinguishes its radiance."*

The sun and moon in the heavens are the water and fire of the world.
The sun belongs to the essence of Great Yang fire, its light never waning.
The moon belongs to the essence of Great Yin water, borrowing the sun’s light.
At the juncture of the dark and new moon, the sun and moon converge along the ecliptic, called the conjunction.
Yet though they share the same longitude, they differ in latitude, so even at conjunction, the sun is not eclipsed.
If they share both longitude and latitude, the moon does not avoid the sun, and the yang light is obscured by the yin spirit—
thus solar eclipses always occur on the new moon.
Thus it is said: *"Sun and moon mutually eclipse, ever at the juncture of the dark and new moon."*

Human life aligns with the workings of creation as if tallying tokens.
People know only that Kan water is the moon, unaware that the single true water within Li is precisely the moon’s essence.
They know only that Li fire is the sun, unaware that the single true fire within Kan is precisely the sun’s light.
At the juncture of the dark and new moon, sun and moon unite, water and fire mutually conceal—
a single true fire of Great Yang sinks to the depths of the northern sea.
As Shaozi said: *"The sun enters the earth, the image of their union."*
In the Elixir Way, this is the meeting of Kan and Li, the moment when yang first stirs.
At this time, one should nurture and refine, the latent dragon must not be lightly employed—
only when the yang light emerges above the earth does it shine brilliantly at midday.
If true yang cannot take command and remains trapped within yin, unable to emerge from the furnace,
this is the image of the northern cold water overwhelming and extinguishing the Great Yang.
Once true fire is submerged by cold water, the sun’s light is heavily obscured by yin—
even at the height of yang’s power at midday, it grows faint and dim, suddenly devoid of radiance.
Thus it is said: *"When water prevails, Kan encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, Li dims the day."*

Kan resides in the northern, secluded palace, at the midnight position, the image of the new moon.
Li resides in the southern, luminous land, at the noon position, the image of the sun at day.
Only when water and fire are balanced do they interact harmoniously.
If one prevails, they eclipse and bring disaster.
The mutual eclipsing of sun and moon is the meaning of *"raising water to douse fire, suddenly extinguishes its radiance."*
This should be compared with the middle section: *"At the dark and new moon, they eclipse and obscure, overwhelming one another."*
Though this speaks only of their mutability,
if water does not prevail and fire does not wane,
the sun bestows virtue, the moon unfurls its light—
the natural nature and essence of water and fire are the constant Way of yin-yang interaction.
How could eclipses and disasters arise?
Thus it is said: *"Yin and yang consume one another, their interaction the natural Way."*

When sun and moon deviate from their constant Way, it is called eclipse.
When yin and yang follow their nature, it is called mutual nourishment.
Just as the union of the celestial sun and moon has constancy and change,
the interaction of Kan and Li within the body has success and failure—
one must be cautious and meticulous.

Names fix their essence,
characters speak of their nature.

When gold returns to its original nature, it may truly be called the Reverted Elixir.
This passage speaks of gold reverting to its nature—this is the ultimate meaning of the Reverted Elixir.
The primordial essence within Li is the true water of Greater Yin, also called "wood-fluid."
The primordial qi within Kan is the true fire of Greater Yang, also called "gold-essence."
In the Dao of the Elixir, water and fire serve as the body, gold and wood as the function.
Master Guan Yin said: *"Gold and wood are the interaction of water and fire."*
Though gold and wood are two distinct things, their root is but a single gold-nature.
This gold-nature originally emerges from the primordial Qian; before birth, it is pure and refined, indestructible through ten thousand kalpas.
Yet after birth, once the primordial chaos is broken, it enters the Kun palace—this is the gold-essence within Kan, where Qian’s nature transforms and is called "emotion."
The one yang of Qian having become Kan, the one yin of Kun enters within—this is the wood-fluid within Li, where Kun’s emotion transforms and is called "nature."
For wood governs tranquility, and thus it is termed "nature"—as it is said: *"Man is tranquil at birth; this is Heaven’s nature."*
Gold governs movement, and thus it is termed "emotion"—as it is said: *"Stirred by things, the nature’s desires move."*
Though the two emerge as different names, they are like a single person who has both a given name and a courtesy name: though name and courtesy name differ, nature and emotion remain one.
Thus it is said: *"Names fix their essence, characters speak of their nature."*

Originally, the gold within Qian transformed into Kan—this is nature turning into emotion.
Once this turning occurs, all things turn without cease; the cycle of rebirth and inversion lies before one’s eyes—this is the "forward path" that gives rise to humans and beings.
Now, if one retrieves the true gold within Kan and returns it to Qian, this is emotion reverting to nature.
Once this reversion occurs, all things revert without exception; firmness, wholeness, and constancy are suddenly attained, transcending all leakage—this is the "reverse path" that perfects sages and immortals.
If the practitioner of the Dao, after awakening to responsiveness, does not lose that initial state of serene stillness, the Elixir may then be reverted.
Thus it is said: *"When gold comes to return to its original nature, it may truly be called the Reverted Elixir."*
These two lines are not only the key to the entire *Cantong Qi*, but also thread through ten thousand scriptures and a thousand classics.
The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *"Like gold ore mixed with gold-essence, once the gold is pure, it no longer forms impurity."*
The *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: *"Like smelting gold ore, the gold is not produced by smelting; once it has become gold, it does not revert to ore. Through endless time, the nature of gold remains uncorrupted."*
This is the same principle.
Lü Chunyang said: *"Gold, when it floats, reveals its nature; wood, when it sinks, reveals its heart."*
Zhang Ziyang said: *"The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar; the jade pool first receives silver within water."*
This, too, is the same principle.
Thus it is clear: the three treasuries of Buddhist scriptures expound only the two words "gold-nature," while the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics attest only to the two words "Reverted Elixir."
Moreover, when compared with the *Changes* of Fuxi, they align as perfectly as tallying tokens—one may suddenly awaken to this truth.

The symbolic imagery of the Reverted Elixir has already been set forth in the previous chapter; here, only its name and meaning are concluded.
I dare not speak idly, but follow the pattern of the sages’ writings.
Ancient records reveal the dragon and tiger; the Yellow Emperor praised golden blossoms.
Huainan refined autumn stone; Yuyang added the yellow sprout.
The worthy may uphold and practice this; the unworthy should not partake.
The Dao of past and present is one; in conversation, we expound our thoughts.
Let scholars strive earnestly, reflecting deeply and pondering.
The essential teaching is utterly plain, shining clearly and never deceiving me.

This passage speaks of the fundamental principle of the Reverted Elixir, truly transmitted from the ancient sages.
Since the beginning of creation, there has been only this single point of gold-nature.
Attaining this for self-cultivation, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood—it is precisely this.
Attaining this to save the world, writing books and establishing teachings—it is also this.

Across a thousand ages past and a thousand ages yet to come, whenever a sage arises, this heart and this principle remain unchanged—far beyond the reach of all empty rhetoric or twisted interpretations. Thus it is said: *"I dare not speak falsely, but emulate the writings of the sages."* The true gold-nature is originally nameless and wordless; ancient sages, in awakening later learners, forcibly assigned names and terms, which vary endlessly. The Way of the Reverted Elixir takes the qi of the two arcs, dragon and tiger, to pair and complete it—hence the ancient alchemical classics reveal the two entities, dragon and tiger. Thus it is said: *"Ancient records reveal dragon and tiger."*

Yet this is not all. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor refined the Reverted Elixir and praised it as "golden blossoms"; Huainan, upon completing the elixir, named it "autumn stone"; Yuyang, upon completion, called it "yellow sprout." Dragon and tiger symbolize one metal and one wood; golden blossoms symbolize metal within water; autumn stone, though originally black, turns white, also symbolizing metal within water; yellow sprout symbolizes metal within earth. In the end, though names differ, their nature and essence are one. This is what is meant by *"concise yet not cumbersome."*

For instance, in this text, terms like dragon and tiger, golden blossoms, and yellow sprout appear repeatedly—sometimes metaphorically representing two substances, sometimes the true seed—all derived from the transmitted writings since the Yellow Emperor’s time. How could these be mere empty rhetoric or twisted interpretations meant to mislead later learners? Yet this practice can only be upheld and pursued by the worthy; it must never be shared with the unworthy. Why? The worthy possess innate wisdom and clarity; with a single enlightening word from a true teacher, they immediately seek the primordial golden qi, refine the Reverted Elixir, and remain unswayed by distractions. The unworthy, dull and easily deluded, upon hearing of dragon and tiger, suspect it to be the external path of furnace and fire; upon hearing of golden blossoms or yellow sprout, they guess it involves the five metals or eight minerals; upon hearing of autumn stone, they think of refining and consuming urine. Mistaking the great Dao of the ancient sages, they stray into the heterodox arts of alchemical forging—how could such individuals be fit for this practice?

Yet all these varied names ultimately refer to nothing but the primordial gold-nature. There is only this one truth; anything beyond it is not genuine. After the ancient sages and worthies grasped the principle and mastered the practice, they wrote books and established teachings. Though each expressed it in their own way, when it came to the essential truth, they spoke as if face-to-face, revealing the most urgent and vital points without a single word of self-deception or deceit toward others. If scholars can seek out a true teacher, delve into the profound mysteries, and strive earnestly with deep reflection, comparing all with this text, they will find not even a hair’s breadth of discrepancy. Then they will realize that the great Way of the Reverted Elixir lies right before them, and the immortal elder has indeed not deceived them. Why hesitate to accept it directly, only to be led astray by doubts?

This is the concluding section of the "Subduing and Ingesting" chapter in the preceding text, specifically summarizing the two characters "Reverted Elixir." Thus Master Wei explains his purpose in writing and urges particular caution.

Yet a doubt arises: Master Wei states that the *Can Tong Qi* was composed by following the *Book of Changes* of the Three Sages, yet here he speaks of emulating the sages, specifically referring to those after the Yellow Emperor—this is the first point of confusion. Furthermore, it is commonly said that Master Wei did not know from whom he received his teachings but composed the *Can Tong Qi* by modeling it after the ancient *Dragon-Tiger Classic*—this is the second point of confusion.

I have privately examined the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* as transmitted in recent times, reading it repeatedly. Not only is its meaning shallow, incomparable to the *Can Tong Qi*, but its chapters and sentences are clearly imitative, even mimicking the tone and style—its path of plagiarism is glaringly obvious. This is likely the work of some meddlesome person who, seeing the line *"ancient records reveal dragon and tiger"* in this text and failing to understand its meaning, fabricated a false book to deceive the world and confuse the masses. Later scholars like Peng Xiao and Wang Dao, lacking discernment, were willingly deceived and even used this book as a basis for composing their own works—how grievously mistaken!

Since Wang and Peng set this precedent, later practitioners of furnace and fire have all revered the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* as their guide, forcibly linking it to this text in an unbreakable bond. As a result, the great Way of the Golden Elixir has degenerated into the heterodox arts of alchemical forging—truly lamentable. Then what does *"emulating the sages"* truly mean? It broadly refers to the various patriarchs since the Yellow Emperor, and *"emulating"* means tracing the origins of the various names like golden blossoms and yellow sprout. It does not specifically point to the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*. If it did, then where do names like golden blossoms and yellow sprout come from? Even if the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* did exist, it would have been an ancient text, vaguely transmitted in Master Wei’s time, but long since lost today—certainly not the spurious *Dragon-Tiger Classic* circulated in recent times.

Then how do we reconcile *"emulating the sages"* with *"following the Three Sages"*? The two are not contradictory. The various names in this text—dragon and tiger, golden blossoms—were passed down in writings since the Yellow Emperor, while the three symbolic methods of medicinal substances, furnace and cauldron, and firing times are unquestionably derived from the *Book of Changes* of the Three Sages. This is how *"governing and subduing"* and *"subduing and ingesting"* form an inner and outer correspondence. The reference to consulting alchemical classics is clearly evidenced in the concluding lines of the middle section: *"Only the ancient sages and worthies refined the nine cauldrons."* The origin from the *Book of Changes* is even more clearly evidenced in the concluding lines of the final section: *"The song recounts the great *Book of Changes*, the transmitted words of the Three Sages."*

The concluding sections of the latter two parts resonate with this chapter, and neither of those sections mentions the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* even once. Thus, it is beyond doubt that *"emulating the sages"* here is a general reference. I do not presume to offer arbitrary interpretations but merely follow what the immortal elder himself has revealed. This is a major unresolved question of ancient times; though my insights are limited, I humbly point it out. Whether others approve or blame me, how could I dare refuse?

The chapters on *fushi* (ingesting the elixir) in this section are even more profound than those in the previous two volumes. With this elucidation, they shine as brightly as the sun at midday.

As for the case of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic*—where the false has mingled with the true—no one has dared to speak of it for over a thousand years. Now that it has been thoroughly exposed, how utterly exhilarating!

**Middle Section of the *Cantong Qi* (Upper Volume, "Governing the Polity," four chapters—this being the foremost of the middle section).**
The first section’s fifteen chapters are divided into three volumes: governing the polity, nurturing nature, and ingesting the elixir, corresponding to the three essentials of medicinal substances, the crucible, and the firing process. The great Dao of the Golden Elixir is already fully expounded here, yet while it presents the overarching framework, there remain subtle operations that have not been exhaustively examined. Fearing that learners might fail to discern these and stray into divergent schools, this section is likewise divided into three volumes, dissecting the distinctions chapter by chapter, each part mirroring and complementing the first section.

Some modern scholars have divided the first section into the "Classic" and this section into its "Commentary," while others have separated the four-character lines as the "Classic" and the five-character lines as the "Commentary." They do not realize that only when the three sections are read as a continuous whole does the *Cantong Qi* form a complete work. A thousand years later, who can arbitrarily decree what is "Classic" and what is "Commentary," merely fragmenting its chapters and verses? All such claims are baseless conjectures, which I reject.

This volume focuses on governing the polity, though the nurturing of nature and the ingestion of the elixir are already implicit within it, its meaning aligning with the first section.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Four Symbols Revolving Within the Center**
*Qian* (Heaven) is firm, *Kun* (Earth) is yielding; they unite and encompass one another.
Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other.
Through this, transformation unfolds, and essence and *qi* expand.
*Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) crown the head, their radiance spreading forth.
Mysterious and obscure, beyond depiction in diagrams,
The sages measured and ordered them, arranging the primal foundations.
The four merge into chaos, directly entering the void of non-being.
The sixty hexagrams revolve, spread out like a chariot.
The dragon-horse is harnessed; the enlightened ruler governs the times.
In harmony, all follows; the path is level and not deviant.
Deviant paths are perilous and treacherous, toppling nations and families.

This chapter speaks of the self-transformation of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, illuminating the wondrous mystery of the primordial circle within.

*Qian* is firm, *Kun* is yielding; they unite and encompass one another.
Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other.
Through this, transformation unfolds, and essence and *qi* expand.
This passage describes *Qian* and *Kun* as the essence of *Kan* and *Li*. For *Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Book of Changes*, the true source from which *Kan* and *Li* emerge. The primal *Qian* is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the primal *Kun* is the mother of the myriad things. *Qian* moves and is straight, its nature fundamentally firm, thus it initiates and embodies the Way of the Father. *Kun* is still and receptive, its nature fundamentally yielding, thus it nurtures and embodies the Way of the Mother. The two unite and contain all transformations. Hence it is said: *"Qian is firm, Kun is yielding; they unite and encompass one another."*

The father governs bestowal, capable of knowing the great beginning—this is what is meant by *"the male yang disseminates the primal and extends it."* The mother governs reception, capable of completing things—this is what is meant by *"the female yin transforms and envelops the yellow."* Hence it is said: *"Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other."* Only when the two depend on each other can transformation be accomplished. *"Transformation"* (造) is the movement from non-being to being; *"change"* (化) is the movement from being to non-being. From non-being to being, true emptiness takes wondrous form—*Qian* conceals *Kun* within. From being to non-being, wondrous being returns to true emptiness—*Kun* conceals *Qian* within. *Qian* concealing *Kun* is the primordial unity of essence; *Kun* concealing *Qian* is the ancestral origin of *qi*. With host and guest inverted, the wonder of transformation is revealed. Hence it is said: *"Through this, transformation unfolds, and essence and qi expand."* This speaks of *Qian* and *Kun* uniting to generate the medicinal substances of *Kan* and *Li*, just as the *Book of Changes* says: *"Heaven and Earth intermingle, and the myriad things are transformed into harmony."*

*Kan* and *Li* crown the head, their radiance spreading forth.
Mysterious and obscure, beyond depiction in diagrams,
The sages measured and ordered them, arranging the primal foundations.
The four merge into chaos, directly entering the void of non-being.
This passage describes *Kan* and *Li* as the function of *Qian* and *Kun*. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite, *Kan* and *Li* form between them. *Li* is the essence of utmost yin; *Kan* is the *qi* of utmost yang. Though they arise after Heaven and Earth in the manifest world, they are born before Heaven and Earth in the primordial. In the workings of transformation, they become the solar spirit and lunar soul, their radiance illuminating all, capable of generating the myriad things. Within our bodies, they become the solar essence and lunar brilliance. When their radiance is gathered, it can produce the great elixir. Is this not what is meant by *"Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading forth"*?

This primal essence and primal *qi*—ethereal and indistinct—are neither being nor non-being, usable yet invisible, difficult to fathom. How could they be transmitted through diagrams? It is entirely thanks to the sages who composed the *Book of Changes* that they were measured in many ways. Using *Qian* as the father and *Kun* as the mother, *Kan* as the son and *Li* as the daughter, the text aligns them with the crucible, the furnace, and the medicinal substances. There is nothing here but the arrangement of the foundations of primal transformation, enabling those who practice inner observation to know where to begin.

If cultivators of the Dao can model the crucible and furnace after *Qian* and *Kun*, and gather the medicinal substances by concentrating *Kan* and *Li*, then the solar essence and lunar radiance will naturally coalesce and revolve within the ancestral aperture, merging into chaos and returning to the primordial void of a single *qi*—the great elixir lies within. Hence it is said: *"The four merge into chaos, directly entering the void of non-being."* This speaks of *Kan* and *Li* uniting and returning to the ancestral aperture of *Qian* and *Kun*, just as the *Book of Changes* says: *"When male and female unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and generated."*

The sixty hexagrams revolve, spread out like a chariot.
The dragon-horse is harnessed; the enlightened ruler governs the times.
In harmony, all follows; the path is level and not deviant.
Deviant paths are perilous and treacherous, toppling nations and families.
This passage describes the regulation of the firing process. Excluding the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—which correspond to the crucible and medicinal substances—the remaining sixty hexagrams are arranged in cyclical order, corresponding to the revolutions of the celestial sphere. In a single day, they align with *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*; in a single month, with the new moon, full moon, and quarter phases; in a single year, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter. They circulate endlessly, forming the image of a chariot being spread out. Yet where there is a chariot, there must be a horse to harness it.

What is meant by "dragon-horse"? The dragon governs the heavens, mastering ascent and flight. The horse treads the earth, mastering regulation and submission. When compounding the elixir, spirit and qi guard one another, daring not to soar—thus the celestial yang dragon of governance transforms into the earthly kun horse of traversal. Step by step, it follows the compass and square, as a sovereign governs ministers, establishing the web of law and discipline, not daring the slightest laxity. Hence it is said: *"The dragon-horse is harnessed; the enlightened ruler governs the times."*

The method of driving a chariot aligns closely with that of governing the state: one must hold the six reins in hand, harmonizing and attuning them. The chariot follows the horse, the horse obeys the driver, advancing steadily along the grand thoroughfare. It is fitting to remain upright and level, not tilting or slanting. Should it tilt even slightly, peril and obstruction lie ahead, and overturning follows swiftly—just as a ruler who strays from the constant Way endangers the state.

In the Dao of the elixir, the body is the chariot, intention the horse, and the one who governs them is the heart-monarch. At the moment of gathering and union, one relies on the heart-monarch’s steadfastness to curb the waywardness of the intention-horse. The slightest negligence risks damaging one’s nature and harming the elixir—how can one not be vigilant?

In all cases, there is a single master: in the chariot, it is the driver; in governance, the enlightened ruler; in the heavens, the handle of the Dipper; in the Dao of the elixir, the celestial heart—all speak of holding the reins in hand. The passage in the previous chapter on governance, *"The essential Way and the handle of the Plough,"* conveys this same meaning.

The main purport of this chapter corresponds to the opening chapter of the preceding section. The passage on *"qian’s firmness and kun’s yielding"* echoes the discourse on *"the gates of qian and kun."* The passage on *"kan and li at the forefront"* mirrors the discussion of *"kan and li as the encompassing frame."* The passage on *"the sixty hexagrams in cyclical order"* aligns with the teaching on *"turning the hub and aligning the axle, governing the exterior from the center."* The rest may be inferred by analogy, though this is but a rough approximation.

*Chapter Seventeen: Movement and Stillness in Accord with the Times*

When the noble person abides in their chamber and utters words of goodness, they elicit response from a thousand *li* away. This refers to the lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang. Store the vessel and await the proper time; do not transgress the hexagram’s month. *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Here I merely present two images, unable to exhaust their details. Establishing righteousness and enacting punishments, applying benevolence and bestowing virtue—those who defy them meet misfortune, while those who follow them attain good fortune. Follow the calendar and decrees with utmost sincerity and meticulous care. Diligently observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. At the solstices, the measurements shift; discord and crookedness arise. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the equinoxes, alignment falters, not even a moment’s delay. Floods and droughts contend; wind and rain lose their rhythm. Locusts surge like boiling water; strange omens emerge on all sides. Heaven displays its portents: mountains collapse, the earth splits. The filial child’s devotion moves the imperial standard. Words uttered near at hand flow afar to distant lands. Some bring disaster, some bestow fortune; some usher in great peace, some incite war. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intent. Movement and stillness follow constancy, adhering to their guiding line. The four seasons proceed in harmony, aligning with the *qi*. Hardness and softness are decisively divided, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* flows in ceaseless circulation, bending and stretching, reversing and returning. This chapter speaks of the firing times in inner alchemy—every movement and stillness must not lose its proper season.

When the noble person abides in their chamber and utters words of goodness, they elicit response from a thousand *li* away. This refers to the lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber, issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang. Store the vessel and await the proper time; do not transgress the hexagram’s month. *Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days. Here I merely present two images, unable to exhaust their details. Establishing righteousness and enacting punishments, applying benevolence and bestowing virtue—those who defy them meet misfortune, while those who follow them attain good fortune. This passage speaks of movement and stillness not losing their proper time, serving as the standard for the firing times. The essential point of refining the elixir lies entirely in the celestial firing times, and the essence of the firing times lies entirely in every movement and stillness. The preceding chapter described the sixty hexagrams spreading out like a chariot’s canopy, revealing that the rhythm of the firing times shares the same pivotal mechanism as a ruler’s governance. The trigger of this mechanism must not be treated carelessly, even by a hair’s breadth. Thus, it is again likened to *"the noble person abiding in their chamber and uttering words of goodness, eliciting response from a thousand *li* away"*—this is the original text of the *Great Commentary on the Yi*. Master Wei further elucidates it, explaining that the lord of ten thousand chariots is the original Celestial Ruler, the nine-fold chamber is the inner chamber of the spirit, and the Celestial Ruler, dwelling in this secluded chamber, remains still and motionless, purifying the mind and withdrawing into concealment. When moved, it responds and communicates, issuing decrees and commands—all in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang, observing the Dao of Heaven and wielding the workings of Heaven.

When yang reaches its zenith and yin begins to arise, this is called the "Moon Grotto," its hexagram being *Gou* (姤), its month positioned at *wu* (午). When yin reaches its zenith and yang begins to arise, this is called the "Celestial Root," its hexagram being *Fu* (复), its month positioned at *zi* (子). If the time is not yet ripe, one must await it in stillness; if the time must not be missed, one must move to meet it. Thus it is said: *"Store the vessel and await the time; do not transgress the hexagram and month."*

When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, the myriad transformations sprout forth—this is the image of *Zhun* (屯). The inner body of *Zhun* receives *zi* (子), its outer body receives *shen* (申); water is born in *shen*, taking the meaning of sprouting life. Thus it is said: *"Zhun takes zi and shen."* This is what was referred to in the previous section as *"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from zi to chen and si."*

When movement reaches its extreme and stillness begins, the myriad transformations withdraw and conceal themselves—this is the image of *Meng* (蒙). The inner body of *Meng* receives *yin* (寅), its outer body receives *xu* (戌); the fire repository lies in *xu*, taking the meaning of concealment. Thus it is said: *"Meng uses yin and xu."* This is what was referred to in the previous section as *"In autumn and winter, employ the outer body, from wu to xu and hai."*

The two hexagrams alternate in reversal, one day and one night, thereby distinguishing the two solstices of winter and summer. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own day-night reversals, which one may extend and apply accordingly. Thus it is said: *"I merely present the two images; I cannot exhaust their details."*

Once the two solstices are established, the two quarters are divided between them. The upper quarter employs the spring equinox, fundamentally belonging to *mao* (卯) Wood, yet within its virtue lies punishment, reversing to the meaning of stern killing. Thus it is said: *"Establish righteousness and set punishment."* The lower quarter corresponds to the autumn equinox, fundamentally belonging to *you* (酉) Metal, yet within its punishment lies virtue, reversing to the meaning of gentle benevolence. Thus it is said: *"When facing benevolence, bestow virtue."* This is what was referred to in the previous section as *"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn,"* at the time of bathing.

The single cold and single heat of *zi* and *wu*, the single killing and single birth of *mao* and *you*—these are the great divisions of yin and yang, where not even a hair’s breadth may be misaligned. If one aligns with their rhythms, then the external fire and internal tally naturally resonate, just as the lord of ten thousand chariots, enthroned in the nine-fold chamber, issues a single decree and elicits response from a thousand *li* away. Otherwise, a thousand *li* away all will defy. Thus it is said: *"To go against it is ominous; to follow it is auspicious."*

According to the calendar and decrees, utmost sincerity and meticulous care must be observed. Diligently await the days and hours, scrutinizing the waxing and waning of cold and warmth. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm. If the two solstices alter their measures, leading to discord and distortion, then midwinter may become scorching summer, and midsummer may bring frost and snow. If the two equinoxes deviate, even by a moment’s error, water and drought will contend, wind and rain will fall out of season, locusts will surge like boiling water, and manifold anomalies will emerge. Heaven displays its portents: mountains collapse, the earth splits. The filial son, with devoted heart, moves the August Ultimate.

What issues from one’s own mouth may flow afar to distant lands, bringing either calamity or fortune, either ushering in great peace or inciting warfare. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intentions. This passage precisely speaks of the rhythms of the firing process—going against them brings misfortune, while following them brings good fortune.

The single stillness and single movement of the firing process are like decrees that must not be transgressed. Those who cultivate the Dao need only follow and traverse them. In all advances and retreats, comings and goings at the boundaries of the two solstices and two equinoxes, the mind must be utterly sincere, the intent wholly focused. Diligently await the days and hours of ascent and descent, scrutinizing the waxing and waning of cold and warmth—this is what the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* calls *"Only with utmost sincerity does one accord with the natural principle."*

If one slightly transgresses the decrees, even the slightest deviation, regret and harm will converge, damaging the elixir crucible. How can this be verified? Take, for example, the winter solstice, when the first yang arises: by principle, one should advance the fire, yet one must nurture the sprouting of the latent dragon, and the fire must not be excessively intense. At the summer solstice, when the first yin descends: by principle, one should withdraw the fire, yet one must guard against the gradual onset of frost, and the fire must not be excessively cold. If one acts perversely or distorts the proper measures, altering the constant degrees—applying excessive heat when it should not be hot—then midwinter reverts to scorching summer; applying excessive cold when it should not be cold—then midsummer reverts to frost and snow.

As for the spring and autumn equinoxes, yin and yang are evenly balanced, water and fire are in equilibrium. At this point, one must bathe, cleansing the mind and purifying thoughts, harmonizing and blending the center. Only then can the true *qi* within the crucible congeal. If the intent is not focused, scattering in all directions, then even a moment’s error will follow. If water is excessive, it becomes a flood;

If fire is excessive, it becomes a drought; and blind winds with strange rains fail to meet their proper seasons. Not only this—if the moment’s timing is amiss, then in minor cases, locusts arise at once, and the jade crucible and golden tripod boil over; in major cases, mountains and rivers split asunder, the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon flee in chaos. All these are what is meant by “to go against it is inauspicious.”

This occurs because the Heart-Monarch has grown lax, and the Spirit-Chamber lacks a master, thus summoning calamities and transformations. If the Dao-practitioner can instead turn the light inward and guard it, never straying for even an instant—like a filial son serving his parents, seeing the formless and hearing the soundless—then with such focused intent, the Supreme Ultimate is naturally moved. The Supreme Ultimate is the true sovereign within Heaven, the primordial spirit of the Heavenly Valley within oneself. The precelestial primordial spirit is utterly still, inherently without coming or going, facing or turning away. But once a postcelestial thought stirs, good and ill fortune are immediately felt in response. It is like a filial son serving his parents: though their bodies may be apart, their moments are subtly connected; even a thousand *li* away, aches, itches, and pains are never unshared. Is this not what is meant by “near, it issues from one’s own mouth; far, it flows into distant lands”?

Thus, every moment aligns, and calamities do not intrude—this is what is meant by “to follow it is auspicious.” Here, we see only a single mechanism of resonance: whether one goes against it to summon misfortune or follows it to bring blessing; whether one remains composed to receive the felicity of great peace or acts restlessly to brew the disasters of war. The origins of good and ill fortune, regret and remorse—do they not all arise from the breast of the one who dwells within? For to go against it is inauspicious, to follow it is auspicious; auspiciousness and inauspiciousness stand opposed, with regret and remorse lying between them. Though there is but one auspicious outcome, three others—misfortune, regret, and remorse—dwell among them. How can one not be cautious?

Movement and stillness have their constancy; one must adhere to the guiding line. The four seasons follow their proper order, harmonizing with *qi*. Hard and soft are decisively distinguished, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* flows in circulation, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating. This passage concludes by stating that movement and stillness have their fixed times, and one must not lose their standard.

For in the Dao of the Elixir, movement and stillness align with the workings of Creation: when movement reaches its extreme, it enters stillness, sinking into profound obscurity—here, one must empty oneself and await the moment. When stillness reaches its extreme, it emerges into movement, arising from the dim and indistinct—here, one must apply intent to gather and refine. If, when stillness is called for, one introduces movement, or when movement is called for, one introduces stillness, this is forced and artificial, losing the constant Way. Hence it is said, “Movement and stillness have their constancy; one must adhere to the guiding line.”

Once the constancy of movement and stillness is understood, at the two solstices, one should advance the fire and retreat the tally; at the two equinoxes, one should nurture with warmth and bathe. Each must be fitting, only then can one correspond with the proper *qi* of the four seasons. Hence it is said, “The four seasons follow their proper order, harmonizing with *qi*.”

Hardness pertains to the martial fire, softness to the civil fire. When body and mind have not yet merged, one must employ martial fire to temper them, never allowing the slightest softness to intrude. When spirit and *qi* have already harmonized, one must employ civil fire to secure and strengthen them, never allowing the slightest hardness to intrude. Hence it is said, “Hard and soft are decisively distinguished, never encroaching upon one another.”

The essentials of the Golden Elixir lie entirely in harmonizing the Four Images and gathering the Five Phases. The Four Images are arrayed in a circle, with the virtue of Earth at the center; east, west, south, and north each have their boundaries—one must neither exceed nor fall short. Hence it is said, “The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting.”

Where there is the *qi* of yin and yang, there are the qualities of hard and soft; where there are the qualities of hard and soft, there are the times of movement and stillness—this is the true *Yi* within oneself. The true *Yi* flows throughout the body, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating, all in perfect accord. It is like a ruler issuing a decree, and a thousand *li* away, all respond. This chapter elaborates on the measures of the fire-times, mutually illuminating the earlier passages on the early and late stages of *Zhun* and *Meng*, and the cold and heat of spring and autumn.

The earlier passage presented the general outline, thus speaking only of attainment and not of loss; here, the details are expounded minutely, thus both attainment and loss are set forth, so that Dao-practitioners may know what to emulate and what to guard against.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Union of Kan and Li**

Between the dark and new moons, tally and action converge at the center. Primal chaos and vast obscurity—feminine and masculine follow one another. Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich, bestowing transformation and flowing in circulation. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured. Employ it to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.

It begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning to the right, it revolves like a wheel, spitting forth sprouts. In the hidden depths, images appear, scattering radiant essence. Above *Ang* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges to set forth. Yang *qi* initiates its inception—*Chujiu*, the Hidden Dragon.

Yang is established in threes, yin flows in eights. On the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. *Jiu’er*, the Dragon Appears—peaceful and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the body of *Qian* is complete. *Jiusan* watches in the evening with trepidation, the divine tally waning and breaking. As flourishing and decline gradually transform, it ultimately returns to its origin. *Xun* inherits its lineage, securing and upholding it.

*Jiusi*, Perhaps Leaping—advancing and retreating, the Way is perilous. *Gen* governs progression and cessation, one must not exceed the proper time. On the twenty-third day, one guards the crescent phase. *Jiuwu*, the Flying Dragon—Heaven’s position brings joy. *Liwu*, Earth submits, binding and encompassing beginning and end. It nurtures the many offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds.

*Shangjiu*, the Exalted Dragon—its virtue battles in the wilds. *Yongjiu*, soaring and fluttering, becomes the compass and square of the Way. The yang numbers are exhausted, and once exhausted, they arise anew. Following emotions to unite with nature, turning and joining together. The revolving jade mechanism ascends and descends, rising and falling. Circulating through the six lines, it is difficult to perceive. Thus, it has no fixed position—it is the ancestral founder of the *Yi*.

This chapter speaks of the union of Kan and Li to produce the elixir, corresponding to the lunar phases of new moon, crescent, full moon, and waning. This is the fire-timing of the minor celestial cycle. Between the dark of the moon and the new moon, the tally is joined and the center traversed. Primal chaos and vast obscurity—female and male follow one another. Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich, bestowing transformation and flowing freely. The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured. It is fitting to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.

This passage describes the conjunction of dark and new moon, when the sun and moon meet, forming the root of the great elixir. The marvel of creation lies in the mutual generation of movement and stillness, an endless cycle. Yet without gathering, there can be no dispersion; without hibernation, there can be no growth. Thus, reckoned by the great kalpa, there is *zhen* and then *yuan*; reckoned by a year, there is winter and then spring; reckoned by a day, there is *hai* and then *zi*; reckoned by a month, there must be the dark of the moon before the new moon—this is the image of ending and then beginning anew.

Why is it called the dark and new moon? The moon itself has no light; it receives the sun’s spirit to shine. On the thirtieth night, its light is exhausted and its body concealed—this is called the dark of the moon. At this time, the sun and moon travel together along the ecliptic, their tally joined precisely between dark and new moon. The sun’s essence and moon’s light within our bodies, one south and one north, rely on true intention to draw them together, meeting at last in the central yellow chamber of the spirit. Water and fire achieve harmony precisely between *Xu* and *Wei*, where emptiness reaches its utmost stillness and the numinous arises of itself—this is the true dark and new moon within a single moment. Thus it is said, “Between the dark and new moon, the tally is joined and the center traversed.”

The sun and moon of creation enfold one another with spirit and soul; the sun and moon within our bodies respond to one another with essence and light. When the spirit returns to the qi-cavern, there is neither seeing nor hearing, neither heaven nor earth. The revolving jade mechanism halts for a time, returning to primal chaos and reentering vast obscurity. Within this murky undifferentiation, true yin and true yang naturally pair. Thus it is said, “Primal chaos and vast obscurity—female and male follow one another.”

Within the union of primordial female and male lies the true seed. The primordial qi swirls in profound obscurity, as when the sun’s spirit bestows essence and the moon’s soul receives transformation, allowing essence and qi to flow in hidden communion. Thus it is said, “Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich, bestowing transformation and flowing freely.”

At the moment when sun and moon join their tally, heavenly qi descends into earth, the divine wind falls silent, mountains and seas conceal their clouds. A single point of numinous brightness is enveloped within the chaotic aperture, beyond all seeking. This is the state where a single thought does not arise, and even spirits and gods cannot know it. Thus it is said, “The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured.”

Heaven enters earth, yang enfolds yin within, returning to the root and reviving the mandate. Profoundly hidden as if empty, it is no less than the hibernation of dragons and snakes across the nine provinces or the concealment of pearls and jade in rivers and marshes. Tan Jingsheng said, “Attaining the gate of vast qi, one returns to the root; knowing the vessel of primordial spirit, one sheathes its light.” This is what is meant. Thus it is said, “It is fitting to secure the body, concealing form and hiding away.”

It begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning to the right, it brings forth the wheel and spits forth the sprout. The hidden abyss reveals its image, emitting and dispersing radiant essence. Above *Ang* and *Bi*, *Zhen* sets forth on its march. Yang qi initiates its inception—*Chujiu* is the hidden dragon.

This passage speaks of *Gen*’s solitary yang reversing to become *Zhen*. People know that the moon loses its brightness on the dark of the moon, yet do not realize it truly begins at the last quarter. The last quarter belongs to *Gen*, which in the Later Heaven arrangement occupies the northeast. Among the twelve earthly branches, it lies between *chou* and *yin*; among the twenty-eight lodges, it corresponds to the degrees of *Ji* and *Dou*. For the Way of Heaven turns left in forward motion, beginning at the center of *zi*. The qi of Earth turns right in reverse motion, beginning between *chou* and *yin*.

To understand Heaven’s forward motion, observe the sequence of a year: its order proceeds from north to east, then to south, and from south to west, returning to the north—from *zi* to *chou*, from *chou* to *yin*, emerging from *Zhen* and completing in *Gen*. This is the forward-moving Five Phases of the Later Heaven.

To understand Earth’s reverse motion, examine the lunar lodges in the *Na Jia* system. In the *Na Jia* cycle, *zi* turns right, moving backward to *wei* and *shen*, from north to west, then from west to south—this is the qi of the first quarter, its image the gaining of companions. *Wu* then turns east, moving backward to *yin* and *chou*, from south to east, then from east to north—this is the qi of the last quarter, its image the loss of companions. The two quarters meet precisely between dark and new moon, where *Bo* in *Gen* reverses to become *Fu* in *Zhen*—this is the reverse application of the Five Phases in the Earlier Heaven.

The Way of the Golden Elixir relies entirely on the Earlier Heaven. The *Na Jia* system shares the same body as the celestial Great Yin. True Water of the Great Yin is born at *wu*, from the single yin of *xun* on the sixteenth to the two yins of *gen* on the twenty-third. Yin comes to strip away yang, leaving only the last fruit. Then, turning from east to north, it arrives precisely at the junction of *chou* and *yin*, at the degrees of *Ji*-Water and *Dou*-Wood, spiraling into *yi* and *gui*. *Gen*’s solitary yang is utterly lost, becoming *Kun*. Within the body, this is the spirit entering qi, the myriad transformations returning to the root—this is the image described as “*wu* turns east, the northeast loses its companions.”

At this time, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. True Fire of the Great Yang arises at *zi*, for yang has no principle of total destruction. The mutual polishing of sun and moon occurs precisely in the northern land of *Xu* and *Wei*. Once their conjunction is complete, they gradually turn from north to west. The moon’s soul here faintly reveals yang light—this is called “turning to the right, bringing forth the wheel and spitting forth the sprout.” A single point of true fire lies hidden in the depths of the northern sea—this is called “the hidden abyss reveals its image, emitting and dispersing radiant essence.” As the radiant essence gradually emerges, on the first and second day, and by the third day, it arrives precisely at the junction of *wei* and *shen*, at the degrees of *Ang*-Sun and *Bi*-Moon. Above *geng*, at dusk, a hook appears like an upturned bowl. Within *Kun*, a single yang emerges to become *Zhen*. Within the body, this is the first warming of the lead crucible, the tender new sprout of the medicine—this is the image described as “*zi* turns right, the southwest gains its companions.”

Though yang qi has now arisen, its inception remains nascent, its fire-force still faint—precisely corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram’s “first nine: the hidden dragon.” At this stage, one should only gently nurture the *zi*-pearl, not yet apply fierce fire. This passage speaks of the sun and moon uniting as jade disks, giving birth to the great elixir of golden cinnabar—this is the work of the *living zi-hour*. As Master Yin the Perfected said, “To seek the great elixir as the root of cinnabar, one must recognize the living *zi*-hour within the body”—this is precisely its meaning.

Between the dark of the moon and the new moon, *Kan* and *Li* unite to form *Qian*. *Qian* is true metal, hence it is called “golden cinnabar.” Thus, the fire-times of golden cinnabar correspond exclusively to the six yang lines of *Qian*. Yang is established through three; yin communicates through eight. On the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. The second nine: the dragon appears—peaceful and luminous. This speaks of the advance of two yang lines to become *Dui*. Three is the position of lesser yang, belonging to *Zhen*; eight is the number of lesser yin, belonging to *Dui*. The *Zhen* hexagram contains yang within yin, hence “yang is established through three”; the *Dui* hexagram carries yin within yang, hence “yin communicates through eight.” On the third day, the moon emerges in the *geng* direction, bearing the image of *Zhen* stirring; on the eighth day, the first quarter moon appears in the *ding* direction, bearing the image of *Dui* moving. When the moon reaches the first quarter, the golden essence in the crucible begins to flourish, the dragon’s virtue stands at its center—thus it is also the image of “the second nine: the dragon appears—peaceful and luminous.” Yet in *Zhen*, the one yang has only just stirred beneath two yin; in *Dui*, the one yin has already moved above two yang—within virtue lies punishment, within generation lies destruction. This is the time of bathing.

When the three and five virtues are perfected, the body of *Qian* is complete. The third nine: vigilant at dusk—diminishing the spirit-tally. Gradual decline and transformation return to the beginning. This speaks of the three yang reaching *Qian*, where yang’s extremity gives birth to yin. When the moon reaches the full-moon day, the virtues of three and five are perfected and the body of *Qian* is complete. At this time, the elixir has ascended the crucible, the golden essence is full and abundant, its light penetrating the great void. Yet at the height of fullness comes decline—one must guard against diminution, hence the image of “the third nine: vigilant at dusk.” This is precisely the time of “all day long, dry and dry again.” The Dao of *Qian* gradually transforms, as *Xun*’s one yin comes to receive the tally. The end of yang is the beginning of yin—this is the time of guarding the city.

*Xun* continues its succession, firmly securing and holding fast. The fourth nine: perhaps leaping—advance and retreat are perilous. This speaks of the one yin’s retreat to become *Xun*. When the body of *Qian* is pure and the yang fire excessive, it must be followed by the yin tally, relying entirely on *Xun*’s one yin to firmly secure and hold fast, gathering and restraining the yang qi. At this time, the “perhaps leaping” of the fourth line of *Qian* has transformed into the “binding sack” of the fourth line of *Kun*. For the fire-times of golden cinnabar take only the three yang of *Qian*; when the three yang retreat, they become three yin. At the extremity of advance comes retreat—one must guard against peril on the path. This is the time of considering danger.

*Gen* governs advance and halt, not to be transgressed in timing. On the twenty-third day, one guards the time of the half-moon. The fifth nine: the flying dragon—heaven’s position brings joy. This speaks of the two yin’s retreat to become *Gen*. With one yang above, the solitary fruit remains—what would advance in yang comes to an abrupt halt. At this time, water and fire are in balance, the yang qi in the crucible gradually congeals, gradually returning to storage. The timing must not be transgressed—precisely on the twenty-third day, one guards the time of the last quarter. The “flying dragon in heaven” of the fifth line of *Qian* transforms into the “yellow skirts, supremely auspicious” of the fifth line of *Kun*—within punishment lies virtue, within destruction lies generation. Thus there is the image of “heaven’s position brings joy.” This is also a time of bathing.

The sixth five of *Kun* receives, binding and encompassing beginning and end. It nurtures and shelters the many children, becoming the mother of its kind for all generations. The ninth above: the exalted dragon—battling virtue in the wilds. This speaks of pure yin returning to *Kun*, where yin’s extremity gives birth to yang. Though the phrase “sixth five” seems to refer specifically to the fifth line of the *Kun* hexagram, it actually encompasses the entire sequence of the moon’s phases from half to full, dark to new. For in the eight trigrams’ correspondence to the heavenly stems, *Qian* and *Kun* bind beginning and end, encompassing the six children within. The six children all rely on *Qian*-father for their inception and on *Kun*-mother for their completion. The creative transformations of a single month comprise three yin and three yang in their entirety. The moon is the great yin—its watery body is pure black, without light—yet it receives and embodies the golden essence of the great yang, borrowing its body to generate light. One yang arises in *Zhen*; from the new moon to the full moon, this is *Qian* borrowing its body. One yin arises in *Xun*; from the full moon to the dark of the moon, this is *Kun*’s true body. Yet from beginning to end, that single point of yang light belongs entirely to the essence of the great yang of *Qian*, merely borrowing *Kun*’s yin-darkness to bear and receive it.

*Qian*-father’s essence relies entirely on *Kun*-mother’s body to encompass and bind it. From the first to the fifth line of *Kun*, the phases of a single month are perfectly complete—hence “the sixth five of *Kun* receives, binding and encompassing beginning and end.” The six children do not exceed the bounds of *Qian* and *Kun*. The three sons and three daughters each follow their kind: the yang souls are always sunlight, belonging to *Qian*; the yin essences are always moonlight, belonging to *Kun*. Yet the three yin are all subsumed under *Qian*—this is the principle that *Qian*’s origin governs heaven, the way of the father. The three yang are all embodied in *Kun*—this is the principle that *Kun*’s origin receives heaven, the way of the mother. Thus *Qian*’s position in the ninth above is called the “line of the ancestral temple,” truly the father of the six children; *Kun*’s position in the sixth above is called the “line of the ancestral temple,” truly the mother of the six children. This speaks from the perspective of *Kun*’s compliance with *Qian*—hence “it nurtures and shelters the many children, becoming the mother of its kind for all generations.”

The great elixir of golden cinnabar originally emerges from the *Kun*-furnace, only then ascending to the *Qian*-crucible. Ascending and then descending, it falls into the Yellow Court. The work of nurturing the fire remains in the *Kun*-furnace, awaiting in stillness the return of the one yang. From beginning to end, the way of the mother is present throughout.

When *Qian*’s upper nine exhausts its change, it becomes *Kun*’s upper six. Yet one must know that yang has no principle of total depletion—its great fruit remains above, towering and unmoved. This is why Jing’s *Fire-Pearl Forest* *Yi* takes the upper line as the ancestral temple, embodying the principle of non-transformation. Thus *Kun*’s upper six line reads: *“Dragons battle in the wilds; their blood is dark and yellow.”* The dragon battling in the wilds is none other than *Qian*’s upper nine, the dragon at its zenith. When yin reaches its extreme, yang contends with it; only after this battle do they achieve harmony. *Kun* is the realm of the limitless, hence the battle is said to occur “in the wilds.” In the later heaven, *Qian* resides in the northwest, the land of utmost yin, so it is also said to battle “in *Qian*.” The *yuan* belongs to *Qian*, the *huang* to *Kun*; through this single battle, *yuan* and *huang* first intermingle, and within them the yang essence is conceived, forming the body of *Zhen*. Thus *Zhen* is called *yuan-huang*: “Within the earth, there is thunder”—the first stirring of the one yang, splitting open the primordial chaos, turning into the dawn of *Fu*!

*“Use the nine, soaring and free, as the compass and square of the Dao.”* The yang number has run its course; when it ends, it begins anew. Pushing forth emotion to unite with nature, they turn and join together. Circling like the turning jade armillary, ascending and descending, rising and falling. Flowing through the six lines, yet difficult to perceive. Thus it has no fixed position, becoming the ancestral origin of the *Yi*. This passage speaks of the ceaseless circulation of the two functions of *Kan* and *Li*, serving as the conclusion to the entire chapter.

*Qian*’s three and *Kun*’s six combine to form nine. *Qian*’s “use of nine” encompasses *Kun*, while *Kun*’s “use of six” cannot encompass *Qian*. Observing the above, the three yangs and three yins are all governed by *Qian*, while *Kun* merely envelops and complies within. Thus when *Qian*’s nine is invoked, *Kun*’s six is already contained within. Moreover, the great Dao of the golden elixir is rooted in *Qian*’s nature. *Qian* is pure yang, and must be refined through nine revolutions before completion. Hence it is said: *“Use the nine, soaring and free, as the compass and square of the Dao.”* *Qian* belongs to the great yang; when yang is exhausted at nine, it transforms into lesser yin. The *Qian* of the prior heaven, in one revolution, becomes the *Li* nine of the later heaven. One becomes nine, and nine reverts to one—originally without beginning or end. Thus it is said: *“The yang number has run its course; when it ends, it begins anew.”* This is what is later called *“the number of one and nine, ending and then beginning again.”*

Within *Kan* lies the essence of metal, residing in the west; within *Li* lies the nature of wood, residing in the east. Separated by the distance between east and west, they have no means to meet—entirely dependent on the Dipper’s handle to revolve between them, so that the metal’s emotion naturally returns to nature. Hence it is said: *“Pushing forth emotion to unite with nature, they turn and join together.”* The ancients established the jade armillary and sighting-tube to symbolize the revolutions of the celestial sphere. Only these two—nature and emotion—emerge with the sun and enter with the moon, now rising, now descending, now ascending, now falling. Longitude is the north-south axis, while latitude becomes the east-west path. North and south are measured by the meridian of *zi* and *wu*; east and west by the parallel of *mao* and *you*. Like the armillary’s ceaseless revolution, its beginning is unfathomable—this is precisely the function of the *mao-you* celestial circuit. Thus it is said: *“Circling like the turning armillary, ascending and descending, rising and falling.”*

From *Zhen* to *Qian*, from *Xun* to *Kun*, the three yangs and three yins wax and wane among themselves, with no visible presence of the *Kan* and *Li* lines. Yet as the sun departs and the moon arrives, and the moon arrives and the sun departs, their ebb and flow, advance and retreat—all are the wondrous functions of *Kan* and *Li*, though nothing is visible. Hence it is said: *“Flowing through the six lines, yet difficult to perceive.”* The sun and moon grasp *Qian* and *Kun*, circulating through the six voids—this is called the *Yi* without form. This formless *Yi* governs the celestial heart, from which the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines emerge. Is this not the *Yi* without fixed position, the ancestral origin of the *Yi*?

*Qian*’s primal power governs heaven, completing the nine revolutions—thus the “use of nine” becomes the compass and square of the Dao. The sun and moon are the *Yi*, inherently without fixed form—hence the golden elixir is the ancestral origin of the *Yi*, spoken of in mutual terms. This chapter focuses on the workings of the golden elixir. At first, during the dark and new moon conjunction, *Kan* is drawn to fill *Li*, emotion returns to nature, and the one yang is born—this is the foundation of the golden elixir. Then, when the medicine arises in the *geng* direction, ascending from *Kun* to *Qian* and descending again, the three yangs are matched—this is the function of the golden elixir, known as the “fire times of the lesser celestial circuit.” This is a crucial key in the *Cantong Qi*, yet its wonders are only fully revealed when read together with the following chapter.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Union of Qian and Kun**

At the dawn of the new moon, *Fu* arrives, and the yang qi begins to flow. Its entry and exit are unhurried; the marker is set, subtly firm. The Yellow Bell establishes *zi*, and the omen flourishes. Spreading warmth and softness, the common people thrive in constancy. Tending the furnace and applying the twigs, the path opens and light is born. The radiance gradually advances, and the days grow longer. *Chou*’s Great Chariot sets the balance of high and low. Lifting to form *Tai*, hardness and softness rise together. Yin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives. Converging at *yin*, advancing with the season. Gradually passing through *Dazhuang*, flanking the gate of *mao*. Elm pods fall, returning to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, and day and night first divide. *Guai*’s yin retreats, while yang ascends and advances. Washing and cleansing the wings, shaking off the dust of the past. *Qian*’s vigor shines brightly, broadly covering the four neighbors. Yang ends at *si*, centered and interacting. *Gou* begins the sequence, treading frost first. The cold spring at the well’s bottom—*wu* becomes *Linzhong*. The guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host. Withdrawing from the world and relinquishing position, gathering one’s essence. Cherishing virtue and awaiting the time, dwelling in obscurity. *Pi*’s blockage is impassable; sprouts do not grow. Yin extends while yang contracts, names are damaged and harmed. Observing its measures, examining the mood of mid-autumn. Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, growing beneath the cover. *Bo*’s limbs rot, its form diminishing. When the transformed qi is exhausted, the utmost spirit is lost.

When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. Ever in accord with earth’s patterns, it receives from heaven and spreads forth. The primordial profound and distant, though separated, remain connected. Responding to measure and nurturing life, they are the origin of yin and yang. Vast and indistinct, none know their beginning. Those who lose the track first wander astray, while those who follow become lords. No level ground remains without slope—this is the Dao’s nature. Change and renewal flourish, waxing and waning mutually dependent. *Kun* ends and *Fu* begins, like tracing a linked ring. Emperors and kings ride and govern, enduring for a thousand generations.

This chapter speaks of *Qian* and *Kun* uniting to congeal the elixir, corresponding to a year’s six yang and six yin, the fire-timing of the great celestial cycle. The new moon’s dawn is *Fu*, where yang qi first flows. Entering and exiting without haste, it establishes the marker of subtle firmness. *Huangzhong* aligns with *zi*, and its signs gradually manifest. Spreading gentle warmth, the myriad steams attain constancy.

This passage speaks of the first yang’s movement in *Fu*, the initial foundation of the returning elixir. The preceding chapter described *Kan* and *Li* uniting to produce the great medicine—this is the work of the living *zi* hour, where within a single day’s twelve hours, intent may arrive at any moment. Once the great medicine is produced, the precelestial *nayin* fire-timing of yang ascending and yin descending is employed, called the small celestial cycle. Only after one full cycle is complete, when the true *zi* hour arrives, is the great celestial cycle’s fire-timing used.

What is the true *zi* hour? From *Zhen* to *Qian*, movement reaches its extreme and stills; from *Xun* to *Kun*, stillness reaches its extreme and moves again. Attaining emptiness to the utmost, preserving quiescence to its depth—one speck of true yang lies hidden in the ninefold earth, this is the juncture of *hai* and *zi*. When the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, being arises from nonbeing. Suddenly, at midnight, thunder shakes open the earth’s gate, cleaving the heart of heaven and earth from primordial chaos—this corresponds to the winter solstice’s new moon dawn. Thus it is said, “The new moon’s dawn is *Fu*, where yang qi first flows.” This is what is meant by “where the first yang stirs, before the ten thousand things are born”—this is the true *zi* hour within our bodies.

When the first yang returns, its qi is still faint. At this time, one should nurture the hidden dragon with warmth, not hastily advancing the fire. The former kings, on the solstice, closed the passes, allowing nothing to enter or exit, all to refine the protective barrier and guard this faint yang. Thus it is said, “Entering and exiting without haste, establishing the marker of subtle firmness.” Though the yang qi is faint, its mechanism cannot be restrained. Among the twelve pitches, it precisely corresponds to *Huangzhong*; among the twelve earthly branches, it precisely corresponds to the Dipper’s handle pointing to *zi*—all are images of sprouting, growing, and progressing from faint to manifest. Thus it is said, “*Huangzhong* aligns with *zi*, and its signs gradually manifest.”

The yang fire lies below, warming the lead crucible with gentle heat, naturally harmonizing and softening. Amidst the host of yin, this single speck of yang essence serves as its sovereign. Thus it is said, “Spreading gentle warmth, the myriad steams attain constancy.” The myriad steams, in the hexagrams, are five yin; in humans, they are the body’s essence and qi. “Attaining constancy” refers, in the hexagrams, to the one yang; in humans, to the single speck of yang essence presiding over the ten thousand transformations. This speaks of the first yang’s return, establishing the foundation of the great elixir.

Tending the furnace and applying the twigs, opening the path to generate light. The radiance gradually advances, increasing day by day. *Chou*’s *Dalü* binds the proper balance of low and high. This speaks of the second yang’s advance into *Lin*.

Advancing to the second yang, the furnace’s fire-qi gradually flows smoothly. From here, the path is opened, and light is generated. The radiance gradually progresses, and the solar corona daily lengthens. At this time, the Dipper’s handle points to *chou*, and the pitch corresponds to *Dalü*—first low, then high, an image of advancing the fire.

Looking upward to form *Tai*, firmness and softness flourish together. Yin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives. Converging at *yin*, advancing to seize the time. This speaks of the third yang’s advance into *Tai*.

The third yang looks upward, precisely when humans are born in *yin*, the meeting of creation’s opening, where wood’s virtue flourishes and fire is born in *yin*—yin and yang are evenly balanced. Thus it is said, “Firmness and softness flourish together.” At this time, heavenly qi descends and earthly qi ascends; the small departs and the great arrives, yin and yang unite. One must urgently apply fire to correspond—moreover, the first month’s pitch corresponds to *Taicu*, hence the image of converging and seizing the time.

Progressing through *Dazhuang*, flanking the gate of *mao*. Elm pods fall, returning to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, day and night begin to divide. This speaks of the fourth yang’s advance into *Dazhuang*.

The sun rises in the east at the *mao* position, *mao* being the gate of the great yang. In the year, this is the spring equinox; the second month aligns with *mao*, and the pitch corresponds to *Jiazhong*. Thus it is said, “Flanking the gate of *mao*.” Advancing the fire to the fourth yang, the generative qi flourishes, yet within wood’s womb lies metal, life carrying destruction. Thus elm pods fall and return to their root, an image of virtue reverting to punishment. At the spring equinox, day and night begin to equalize, water and fire each half—this is the time of the upper crescent’s bathing.

*Guai* retreats yin, while yang ascends and advances. Washing the wings, shaking off the dust of lodging. This speaks of the fifth yang’s advance into *Guai*.

Five yang ascend, and one yin is about to end—it must be decisively expelled. The third month aligns with *chen*, and the pitch corresponds to *Guxi*—an image of “washing the wings, shaking off the dust of lodging.” Like the great peng preparing to migrate to the southern sea, it stirs its wings, striking the water and soaring upward. The river chariot cannot tarry here—passing this point, it ascends to the summit of Kunlun.

*Qian* is vigorous, flourishing, and bright, broadly covering the four neighbors. Yang ends at *si*, centered and interacting. This speaks of the six yang’s purity in *Qian*.

The fourth month aligns with *si*, and the pitch corresponds to *Zhonglü*. At this time, yang ascends to its peak, above the nine heavens, firelight pervading, golden liquid flowing abundantly—hence the image of “*Qian* vigorous, flourishing, and bright, broadly covering the four neighbors.”

Yet yang reaches its zenith at *si*, and in that very moment, one yin begins to revolve—yin arrives to contend with yang, hence the phrase “centered and interacting.” From the perspective of the six yang, *si* marks their final culmination; yet from the cycle of *Kun*’s end and *Fu*’s beginning, *Qian* stands as the mid-heaven—each interpretation draws from its own meaning.

*Gou* inaugurates the sequence, treading frost as its first sign. The well’s chill spring emerges at *wu*, corresponding to *Rui Bin*. The guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host. This speaks of the one yin’s retreat into *Gou*. When the six yang reach *Qian*, yang at its peak gives birth to yin, and one must then withdraw fire and advance water. *Xun*’s solitary yin enters to take command. Even at the height of yang’s fiery blaze, the cauldron already harbors yin’s water—just as in the *wu* month of midsummer, the well’s depths yield a cold spring. The warning of treading frost thus attaches to *Kun*’s first line. Yin enters as host while yang retreats as guest; *Gou*’s lunar cavern directly opposes *Fu*’s celestial root. The *wu* month, with its pitch corresponding to *Rui Bin*, also embodies this exchange of host and guest.

Withdrawing from the world and relinquishing rank, one gathers and refines one’s essence. Cherishing virtue and awaiting the hour, one dwells in obscurity and darkness. This speaks of the two yin’s retreat into *Dun*. The sixth month aligns with *wei*, and the pitch corresponds to *Lin Zhong*. As the two yin gradually lengthen, yang’s qi slowly withdraws into the cauldron, like the worthy one who retreats from the world and abides in mountain forests—hence the words “cherishing virtue and awaiting the hour, dwelling in obscurity and darkness.”

Obstruction and blockage prevail, nothing sprouts or grows. Yin advances while yang recedes, names and reputations are ruined. This speaks of the three yin’s retreat into *Pi*. At this time, yang returns to heaven and yin to earth; the two qi fail to interact, and the myriad things do not arise. The seventh month aligns with *shen*, and the pitch corresponds to *Yi Ze*. *Yi* means injury; water born in *shen* can erode and extinguish yang’s fire—hence the image of “yin advancing while yang recedes, names and reputations ruined.”

Observe its measures and weigh its balance, discerning the essence of mid-autumn. The young are nurtured, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, emerging beneath the cover. This speaks of the four yin’s retreat into *Guan*. The moon rises in the west at the *you* position, marking the autumnal equinox in the year’s cycle, with its pitch corresponding to *Nan Lü*. Metal’s qi is stern and withering, grasses and trees all wither, yet within metal lies the embryo of wood, and within destruction resides generation. Thus, the aged revert to youth, the withered revive, and the sprouts of shepherd’s purse and wheat emerge in their wake—an image of punishment transforming into virtue. At the autumnal equinox, day and night first equalize, water and fire each claim half—this is the time of the lower crescent’s bathing. In the mid-autumn ordinances, measures are standardized and balances leveled—hence the opening phrase “observe its measures and weigh its balance.”

Peeling away the limbs, dissolving the form. The transformative qi exhausted, the utmost spirit lost. This speaks of the five yin’s retreat into *Bo*. The ninth month aligns with *xu*, and the pitch corresponds to *Wu Yi*. Yin arrives to peel away yang, yang’s qi vanishes without remainder, like the limbs of grasses and trees rotting away entirely, leaving only the solitary fruit at the crown—hence the image of “peeling away the limbs, dissolving the form.” *Xu* is the convergence of closed things; through change comes transformation, the spirit and qi turn inward, now present, now absent—hence the words “the transformative qi exhausted, the utmost spirit lost.” Yet know that the form is not truly destroyed—it merely seems to vanish at the extreme of peeling away. The spirit is not truly lost—it merely seems absent at the extreme of returning and concealing. This is the image of the six yin’s return to *Kun*.

When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to *Kun*’s origin. Ever in accord with earth’s patterns, receiving heaven’s mandate and spreading it forth. The primordial is distant and boundless, seemingly cut off yet connected. Responding to measure and nurturing the seed—these are the origins of yin and yang. Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning. First lost to the track, later becoming the lord. This speaks of the six yin’s return to *Kun*, the end that is also the beginning. The tenth month, pure yin, aligns with *hai*, and the pitch corresponds to *Ying Zhong*—a time of creation’s closure, when our bodies return to the root and restore life. For humans, *Qian*’s origin is nature, and *Kun*’s origin is life. After birth, the entire body, inside and out, is yin—thus *Kun*’s origin serves as the foundation of life. The initial resurgence of one yang in *Fu* originally emerges from pure *Kun*; when accumulated to *Qian*’s six yang, life fully returns to nature. Then, the one yin of *Gou* again turns back from pure *Qian* to *Kun*’s origin; when accumulated to *Kun*’s six yin, nature fully returns to life. Hence the words “when the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to *Kun*’s origin.”

Nature having returned to life, the primordial spirit silently retreats into qi, motionless and still, inwardly nurturing the great elixir—just as in the depths of winter, all things without exception lie dormant. Heaven’s qi descends into the earth, and earth’s qi in turn receives and employs it. The end of concealment is the beginning of manifest benevolence; a single spark of heaven’s mechanism generates without cease—hence the words “ever in accord with earth’s patterns, receiving heaven’s mandate and spreading it forth.”

The utmost height of heaven lies eighty-four thousand *li* from the utmost depth of earth. The upper extreme is the primordial void, the lower extreme is profound darkness—seemingly distant and unreachable, yet the sun’s light and the moon’s essence, of the same kind, draw together like a lodestone to iron, not the slightest barrier between them. Hence the words “the primordial is distant and boundless, seemingly cut off yet connected.”

The sun’s light in heaven and the moon’s essence in earth, one yin and one yang, meet in timely union, breathing and nurturing, engendering the true seed—this is the primordial *Qian*’s ancestral qi. Hence the words “responding to measure and nurturing the seed—these are the origins of yin and yang.” At the first union of the primordial womb, the great elixir is about to form—precisely at the midpoint between *hai* and *zi*, between movement and stillness, lies the most wondrous mechanism of heaven, earth, and humanity. Even sages and worthies cannot fathom it, for it is said: “In the indistinct, yin and yang generate transformation; in the interwoven, heaven and earth suddenly revolve.”

Here the fleeting moment of radiant splendor—how could mere words capture its workings? Thus it is said: “Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning.”

At first, when primal chaos remained undivided, the heart of heaven resided at the center, and the primordial yellow was indistinguishable—hence the words “first one loses the track.” Then, as the great flood parted and the root of heaven stirred, the myriad transformations returned of themselves—hence the words “later it becomes the sovereign lord,” echoing the *Kun* hexagram’s judgment: “First one strays, later one finds the master.” At this moment, the first yang revives, turning into the *Zhen* hexagram’s initial nine.

No level ground but has its slope—this is the Dao’s spontaneity. Change and flux grow ever more vigorous, waxing and waning in mutual dependence. The end of *Kun* is the beginning of *Fu*, like tracing an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings who ride and govern by this principle endure for a thousand generations. This passage speaks of movement and stillness begetting one another in endless cycles, serving as the chapter’s conclusion.

As the six yangs ascend and the fire is advanced, the six yins descend and the tally is withdrawn—extreme movement gives rise to stillness, extreme stillness to movement, all the natural workings of heaven’s Dao. Thus it is said: “No level ground but has its slope—this is the Dao’s spontaneity.” Yin and yang alternate, revealing the principles of exchange and transformation. When yang flourishes, yin must wane; when yin dissolves, yang must rest—hence the words “change and flux grow ever more vigorous, waxing and waning in mutual dependence.” Movement and stillness have no beginning, end and inception no limit. The close of *hui* is the start of *shuo*; the end of *hai* is the beginning of *zi*; the end of *Kun* is the start of *Fu*. One meets it yet sees no head, follows it yet sees no tail—thus it is said: “The end of *Kun* is the beginning of *Fu*, like tracing an unbroken ring.”

The subtlety of the firing times aligns above with the workings of creation and below with the human body. Within, it can govern the heart; without, it can govern the world. Emperors and kings who ride this Dao to govern endure for millennia; alchemists who attain this Dao to refine the heart preserve their dharma-body for a thousand kalpas—hence the words “emperors and kings who ride and govern endure for a thousand generations.” This being the final chapter of the middle section on governance, it concludes with imperial rule, corresponding to the preceding section’s final chapter on the *Mingtang* and the enactment of governance.

This chapter elaborates the great celestial cycle of firing times, complementing the previous chapter from beginning to end. Only after *Kan* and *Li* unite is the great elixir produced; once produced, it may be gathered; once gathered and placed in the crucible, it may be refined. The previous chapter spoke of the moment of gathering; this chapter speaks of the moment of refinement. For gathering, one must recognize the living *zi* hour’s operation, awaiting the juncture of *hui* and *shuo*, when the two luminaries merge their essences, the *geng* direction reveals the moon, and metal is born within water—amidst the indistinct and the profound, one then seeks the primordial pearl within the formless, moving true fire within non-action. When the moon is full and the elixir congeals, this is called the golden elixir.

For refinement, one must recognize the proper *zi* hour’s operation, awaiting the first stir of yang between *hai* and *zi*, when fire arises within water. Only then does one apply the method of closing *Ren* and opening *Du*, fanning with the wind of *Xun*, and pumping with the bellows. Seizing this moment of vigorous fire, one drives the river chariot, fully laden with golden liquid, reversing its flow upward from the *Taiyuan* pass to the celestial valley. At the moment of union, the hundred vessels return to the origin, the nine gates are thoroughly opened, golden essence penetrates the crown, and silver waves surge to the heavens—scenes too wondrous to describe in full. Once the union is complete and yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, and one must swiftly open the gates and withdraw the fire, gradually descending the tower of layers. At this juncture, one must guard against danger and peril, purifying thoughts and cleansing the heart, until the elixir is returned to the earthen crucible—this is called “when the union of *Qian* and *Kun* ceases, a single point falls into the yellow court.”

Once the elixir enters the crucible, one must employ the *mao-you* celestial cycle’s firing times to congeal it. When the sacred embryo is formed, further nurturing is required, along with the work of nursing. When the embryo is complete and qi is sufficient, the infant moves to the upper field, and the primordial spirit transforms and emerges, naturally uniting form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth—this is called the ninefold transmutation of the golden liquid returning elixir.

Yet these two operations—one internal, one external—differ as heaven and earth. From the mouths of past sages, this transmission has been passed down without being committed to writing. Even Master Wei dared not fully disclose the celestial mechanism. He merely likened the waxing and waning of a single month to a single moment in the golden elixir’s workings, and the six yins and six yangs of a year to the nine transmutations of the returning elixir. The true firing times remain secretly embedded within. Those who study the Dao and meet a teacher must grasp the meaning and forget the image.

**Middle Section (Middle Volume on Nurturing Innate Nature, comprising four chapters—this being the central chapter)**

**Chapter Twenty: Returning Innate Nature and Life to the Origin**

To nurture innate nature is to extend life and await its fulfillment. Reflect deeply on what follows, and first consider what precedes. The body one receives is fundamentally empty and void. Primordial essence spreads like clouds, borne by qi at the outset. Yin and yang serve as measures, the dwelling of hun and po. The yang spirit is the sun’s hun; the yin spirit is the moon’s po. Hun and po serve as each other’s chambers. Innate nature presides within, establishing the inner boundary; emotions operate without, constructing the outer walls. When the walls are complete, the people are at peace. At this time, emotions harmonize with *Qian* and *Kun*.

*Qian* moves and extends, qi spreads and essence flows; *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling. The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversals, eight returns, six dwellings. The male is white, the female red—metal and fire restrain each other. Then water settles fire, the beginning of the five phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and without blemish. The Dao’s form and image are the true one, difficult to depict. When it changes and spreads, each dwells in its own place.

Like a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond, spanning a single inch—this is the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete.

After ten months, it emerges from the womb.
Its bones are soft and pliable, its flesh smooth as malt sugar.

This passage speaks of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) sharing a single source—establishing *ming* is precisely how one nurtures *xing*.
To nurture *xing* is to extend *ming* and delay its appointed end.
Examine the latter and consider the former;
one must ponder what comes first.

The body one receives is fundamentally nothingness.
Primal essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* to take its first form.
Yin and yang serve as its measure, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*.

This section speaks of the work of nurturing *xing*—one must thoroughly investigate the root of *xing* and *ming*.

What is *xing*?
A single spirit, vast and penetrating, round as the great void—this is the *Qian* origin of all beginnings.
What is *ming*?
A single *qi*, entwined and nurturing, governing the ten thousand transformations—this is the *Kun* origin of all life.
This is the *xing* and *ming* of the primordial, existing before parents gave birth, originally a single undivided thing, inherently unstained, requiring no cultivation or verification.
Once born into existence, the Supreme Ultimate divides: *xing* takes form, *ming* is established—these two must then be cultivated together.
Yet *xing* fundamentally neither comes nor goes, while *ming* may be prolonged or shortened. If one fails to sustain *ming*, the single spirit will suddenly depart forever.
Those who cultivate the Dao and seek to nurture *xing* must begin with the root of *ming*.
Thus it is said: "To nurture *xing*, extend *ming* and delay its end."

What does "delay its end" mean?
Every person’s *ming* has a fixed term—its coming cannot be delayed, nor can its going.
Only those of great cultivation take control for themselves, unbound by the molding of creation.
Once *ming* is firmly established, true *xing* resides within it.

If one does not know where the original true *xing* ultimately returns, and *xing* is the great matter of the end, then to seek a return to the end, one must first trace its origin.
One must repeatedly inquire: from where did this speck of true *xing* come before birth?
By what does it stand after birth?
Then one will understand that the cultivation of *ming* cannot be delayed.
Thus it is said: "Examine the latter and consider the former."

At the moment of conception, one merely receives the father’s essence and mother’s blood, which gather and congeal into an illusory body—this is the formed body, not the true body.
The true body is originally one with the great void, luminous and pure, fundamentally empty of all things.
Thus it is said: "The body one receives is fundamentally nothingness."

When the ten-month gestation is complete, a speck of primal essence from the great void, like clouds moving and rain falling, suddenly attaches itself, entering directly into the central palace of the spirit chamber to become one’s master.
There, it splits open the ancestral aperture—with a single thunderous sound, the *xing* of Heaven’s mandate divides into one yin and one yang.

For the *qi* of later heaven’s creation, without the primal essence of earlier heaven, would have no master and could not become numinous.
For the primal essence of earlier heaven, without the *qi* of later heaven’s creation, would have no place to rely upon and could not stand.
Thus *xing* and *ming* are fundamentally inseparable.
Thus it is said: "Primal essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* to take its first form."

Once later heaven’s creation divides into one yin and one yang, the yang spirit becomes the *hun*, which governs the light and pure, belonging to the wood-fluid of the east.
The yin spirit becomes the *po*, which governs the heavy and stagnant, belonging to the metal-essence of the west.
The two dwell within the enclosure of *Kan* and *Li*.
Thus it is said: "Yin and yang serve as its measure, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*."

Since *ming* in humans belongs to later heaven’s creation, it carries with it emotions and consciousness.
Only because the original true *xing* intermingles with the karmic roots from beginningless time do arising-and-ceasing and non-arising-and-ceasing combine to form the eight consciousnesses.
The subtlest aspect of consciousness is thought; the wandering aspect of thought is emotion.
Emotion gives rise to the obstruction of wisdom; thought alters the body’s uniqueness.
Thus true *xing* is inverted, and one vainly enters the wheel of rebirth.

Therefore, those who seek to understand *xing* must first understand *ming*.

The yang spirit is the sun’s *hun*; the yin spirit is the moon’s *po*.
*Hun* and *po* serve as each other’s chambers.
*Xing* governs the interior, establishing boundaries and defenses.
Emotion governs the exterior, constructing walls and ramparts.
When walls and ramparts are complete, the people are at peace.

This section properly speaks of the work of establishing *ming* in later heaven.

In later heaven, the single *hun* and *po* are divided between *Kan* and *Li*.
Since the great yang resides in *mao*, the sun’s *hun* within *Li* is the yang spirit.
Since the great yin resides in *you*, the moon’s *po* within *Kan* is the yin spirit.
Though their bodies dwell separately, the sun’s light in *Li* is precisely the jade hare of the moon—thus the sun’s *hun* returns as a yin spirit.
The moon’s essence in *Kan* is precisely the golden crow of the sun—thus the moon’s *po* returns as a yang spirit.
Thus it is said: "*Hun* and *po* serve as each other’s chambers."

Though later heaven’s two things divide *xing* and *ming*, the original *xing* is entirely entrusted to *ming*.
For once yin and yang divide, all is *ming*.
Moreover, the root of *ming* further transforms into emotion, for the changes and unions of yin and yang are nothing but emotion.

Because *xing* is entrusted to *ming*, the primal essence within *Li* and the primal *qi* within *Kan* are both called *ming*.
Because *ming* transforms into emotion, the wood-*hun* of the sun and the metal-*po* of the moon are both called emotion.
Only the speck of original spirit within the ancestral aperture is the original true *xing*.
The original spirit is the sovereign, settled within the aperture, coming and going without ever leaving its gate.
Is this not "*Xing* governs the interior, establishing boundaries and defenses"?

Essence and *qi* are ministers, strictly establishing embankments, guarding front and back, left and right, cutting off all treachery and evil.
Is this not "Emotion governs the exterior, constructing walls and ramparts"?

When the embankments are firm, the master roams leisurely within the secret chamber, unmoving and unshaken, unstartled and unafraid.
Thus it is said: "When walls and ramparts are complete, the people are at peace."

First, the *xing* within is sufficient to restrain emotion; then, the emotion without naturally returns to *xing*.
Guest and host mutually unite; sovereign and minister follow the Dao.
This is the union of *Kan* and *Li*, the initial foundation of the golden elixir—establishing *ming* is precisely how one nurtures *xing*.

At this moment, emotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun.
Qian moves and straightens, *qi* spreads and essence flows;
Kun is still and contracts, becoming the dwelling of the Dao.
The firm bestows and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes.
This passage speaks of the postnatal returning to the prenatal.

The postnatal Kan and Li are none other than the prenatal Qian and Kun. Yet once Qian and Kun are broken, *xing* turns into emotion, and from then on, emotion takes charge—chasing sounds and pursuing forms, unable to return to the origin. Only when the two substances unite, the city walls are complete, and the embankments are established, does emotion return to *xing*. The yin within Li reverts to Kun, and the yang within Kan reverts to Qian.
Thus it is said: "At this moment, emotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun."

The *xing* of Qian is supremely firm: when still, it is focused; when moving, it is direct. The primordial spirit governs essence and *qi* with absolute rigidity and straightness, unyielding.
Thus it is said: "Qian moves and straightens, *qi* spreads and essence flows."
This speaks of the primordial spirit establishing the embankments—what is called "Qian, the origin of beginnings."

The *xing* of Kun is supremely yielding: when moving, it opens; when still, it contracts. The true *qi* of Qian flows and spreads, and Kun compliantly receives it. The primordial spirit, intermingling and transforming, is nurtured within the Yellow Court’s crucible.
Thus it is said: "Kun is still and contracts, becoming the dwelling of the Dao."
This speaks of the primordial spirit’s original womb—what is called "Kun, the source of generation."

The father, Qian, is firm and governs bestowal, yet bestows only a single point of true *qi*;
The mother, Kun, is yielding and governs transformation, requiring constant nurturing in the Central Palace to form the embryo.
Thus it is said: "The firm bestows and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes."
This speaks of Kan and Li uniting to produce the prenatal primordial spirit—the wondrous workings of the golden elixir.

Nine returns, seven reverts;
Eight returns, six abides.
Male white, female red—
Metal and fire restrain each other.
Water settles fire, the beginning of the Five Phases.
This passage speaks of the Four Symbols and Five Phases merging into a single *qi*.

Once Kan and Li revert to Qian and Kun, the postnatal Four Symbols and Five Phases all return to their origin.
Why is this so?
Heaven One generates Water, Earth Six completes it—this is the essence of the North.
Earth Two generates Fire, Heaven Seven completes it—this is the spirit of the South.
Heaven Three generates Wood, Earth Eight completes it—this is the soul of the East.
Earth Four generates Metal, Heaven Nine completes it—this is the corporeal soul of the West.
Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal are the Four Symbols; together with the central Earth of Wu and Ji, they form the Five Phases.
Yet what are called the Four Symbols and Five Phases are merely the two substances, Kan and Li.
The Kan trigram emerges from Kun, and the Water of the North belongs to yin; its base number is six, but with the addition of Heaven One’s yang, it becomes seven.
The Li trigram emerges from Qian, and the Fire of the South belongs to yang; its base number is seven, but with the addition of Earth Two’s yin, it becomes nine.
Now, the Kan of the North returns to Qian, and the Li of the South reverts to Kun—is this not the image of "nine returns, seven reverts"?

The One of the North returns to the Seven of the South, totaling eight;
The Two of the South returns to the Six of the North, also totaling eight.
Yet it speaks of "abiding" because once the One of the North returns to the South, only the completion number of Water remains, abiding in its place without shifting—precisely six.
Is this not the image of "eight returns, six abides"?

Moreover, the Four Symbols originally derive from two substances. Since nine returns and seven reverts, eight naturally returns and six abides.
Thus the *Wuzhen Pian* speaks only of "returning and reverting," revealing the marvel of creation.
Two and Seven combine to form the Metal of the West, its color turning white;
One and Six combine to form the Fire of the South, its color turning red.
White belongs to Metal, red to Fire—taking the Metal of the West and refining it with the Fire of the South,
Thus it is said: "Male white, female red, Metal and fire restrain each other."

Heaven One’s Water emerges from the Qian Palace, originally the true fire of Great Yang;
Earth Two’s Fire emerges from the Kun Palace, originally the true water of Great Yin.
Only after one reverts and one returns do Water return to Water and Fire to Fire, restoring their original essence.
Thus it is said: "Water settles fire, the beginning of the Five Phases."

Earlier it spoke of Metal and Fire—why now of Water and Fire?
The marvel of postnatal creation lies solely in Kan and Li, yet its thousand transformations and myriad changes bear different names.
In terms of Kan and Li’s positions, they are called Water and Fire;
In terms of the *qi* of the two phases, they are called Metal and Water;
In terms of the functions of Jia and Geng, they are called Metal and Wood;
In terms of the work of refinement, they are called Metal and Fire.
Their applications are inverted and unfathomable, yet ultimately they are merely the two substances, Water and Fire.
Though postnatal Water and Fire are divided into two, they are fundamentally the single *qi* of the prenatal.
Once Kan and Li revert to Qian and Kun, this is precisely "nine returns, seven reverts, eight returns, six abides"—transforming into the single *qi* of the prenatal.

The highest good is like Water, pure and flawless.
The form and image of the Dao—true unity is hard to depict.
Though it changes and spreads, each abides in its own place.

This passage speaks of the primordial singular *qi* as the foundation of the Great Elixir. The Dao is fundamentally formless and void, yet from this void arises the singular *qi*. This singular *qi*, undifferentiated in the primordial chaos, is the true unity of prenatal Water—not the postnatal Water of tangible form. If a cultivator of the Dao can gather emotions into nature and merge dualities into oneness, they may recover this prenatal true Water. Its source is utterly pure and flawless; at this moment, body and mind fuse into one, unstained and unadulterated, naturally transparent within and without, like a vast expanse of water in a vessel—hence the saying, *"The highest good is like Water, pure and flawless."*

The Dao transcends form and name, inherently without shape or image. Yet when it generates the singular *qi*, it seems possible to describe. However, this true unity of *qi* is subtle and elusive, manifesting in the formless and appearing in the imageless—beyond all conjecture or speculation of the mind. Thus it is said, *"The form and image of the Dao—true unity is hard to depict."*

This true unity of Water is the single point of *yinqiao* in the Central Palace, the so-called "Supreme Unity containing the true *qi*." Combined, it is one *qi*; divided, it becomes two substances; further divided, it becomes the Four Images and Five Phases. When they interact, the Five Phases transform entirely within the center. Yet Wood remains in the East, Metal in the West, Fire in the South, and Water in the North—each abiding in its proper place. Hence it is said, *"Though it changes and spreads, each abides in its own place."*

This section declares that the true unity of Water is indeed the foundation of the Elixir. As *The Mirror for Compounding the Medicine* states, *"The Lead of the Water Realm is but a single flavor."* If the scholar understands the principle of gathering the Five and uniting the Four, merging dualities into oneness, the *yinqiao* will form, and the Sacred Embryo will take shape. It resembles an egg, where white and black correspond, spanning an inch in all directions—this is the initial stage. The four limbs and five viscera, along with sinews and bones, are all present. After ten months, it emerges from its womb. Its bones are supple enough to coil, its flesh smooth as maltose.

This passage particularly reveals the form of the Dharma-body. When the Sacred Embryo first congeals, a single spark of original spirit lies hidden in the chamber of spirit, indistinct and undivided, like primordial chaos before the separation of darkness and light—akin to the state of an egg. Thus it is said, *"It resembles an egg, where white and black correspond."* Within the chamber of spirit, the space is perfectly square and round, exactly an inch in diameter. The Dharma-body dwells within, growing and flourishing, just as an infant in the mother’s womb—hence, *"spanning an inch in all directions, this is the initial stage."*

To nurture the true embryo, one must proceed from the subtle to the manifest. First, an image forms; then, a shape. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, bones, and joints—all become complete, fully formed yet minute. Thus it is said, *"The four limbs and five viscera, along with sinews and bones, are all present."* Know that the Four Images and Five Phases envelop the Dharma-body like the four limbs and five viscera; as the Dharma-body gradually solidifies, it resembles sinews and bones—yet it is not truly tangible. When the nurturing is complete, after ten months the embryo is fully formed. The infant leaps forth from the Kun furnace, ascending into the Qian cauldron. From here, the furnace and cauldron are reset, and Heaven and Earth are recreated—ushering in a new transformation. Only then does one’s Dharma-body connect with Heaven and Earth, merging with the Great Void. Thus it is said, *"After ten months, it emerges from its womb,"* taking on the appearance of supple bones and flesh smooth as maltose.

This passage describes the form of the Dharma-body as sharing the same creative process as the physical body receiving *qi* in the mother’s womb. Yet while the natural course produces a human, the reverse course yields the Elixir—distinguishing the sacred from the ordinary. This chapter is the first crucial threshold of nurturing nature, corresponding to the previous section on the mutual interaction of the two orifices.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Mutual Resonance of the Two Qi**

A burning-mirror draws fire—without the sun, it cannot glow.
A moon-pearl gathers dew—without stars or moon, how could it yield water?
The two *qi* are profound and distant, yet their resonance still connects—
How much more so when near, stored within the heart and chest?

Yin and Yang pair with the sun and moon; Water and Fire serve as their signs.
This chapter speaks of the mutual resonance of the *qi* of Water and Fire through like attracting like.

The previous chapter described the soul and spirit as mutual dwellings—these are the two substances, Water and Fire. The Dao of the Golden Elixir takes the sun and moon as its body and Water and Fire as its function. In essence, they interpenetrate; in function, they interact. Without Water and Fire, the sun and moon have no means to manifest their essence; without the sun and moon, Water and Fire have no source for their function. Whether drawn from the body or from external things, the principle is the same.

The burning-mirror is a fire-pearl, shaped like a bronze mirror, solid in its center—symbolizing the single Yang within Kan. This object embodies the fiery essence of the Great Yang. Thus, people use it to draw fire, but it must face the sun to succeed. This is because the spark of true Yang is originally the light of the sun’s soul. The sun is the gathering place of light, while the burning-mirror is the summoner of light. Drawing fire with fire—how could it not be effective? Hence it is said, *"A burning-mirror draws fire—without the sun, it cannot glow."*

The moon-pearl is a pearl from a clam, hollow in its center—symbolizing the single Yin within Li. This object embodies the watery essence of the Great Yin. Thus, people use it to gather water, but it must face the moon to succeed. This is because the spark of true Yin is originally the essence of the moon’s spirit. The moon is the repository of essence, while the moon-pearl is the gatherer of essence. Drawing water with water—how could it not respond? Hence it is said, *"A moon-pearl gathers dew—without stars or moon, how could it yield water?"* This is the principle of the mutual interaction of Kan and Li.

The sun and moon in the sky and Water and Fire in the world are separated by countless miles—truly profound and distant. Yet they resonate across barriers, like a magnet attracting iron. This is because like naturally draws like, so the two *qi* spontaneously resonate and connect.

Drawing from distant things, even the insentient still resonate—how much more so when drawing from the body, where the true Water and true Fire of the sentient lie mere inches apart, utterly void yet supremely numinous, responding in an instant to a single breath? Could the true *qi* of the two celestial arcs fail to resonate and transform?

Thus, the true Water within Li flows forth to meet Wu, while the true Fire within Kan comes to join Ji. By employing symbolic methods to gather the essence of the Great Yin and erecting the crucible to collect the *qi* of the Great Yang, like naturally follows like, coalescing into the *yinqie*. For when true Yin and true Yang mutually abide in their dwelling, they become the sun and moon within one’s own body; when the sunlight and moon essence reciprocally engage, they become the Water and Fire within one’s own body. The gathering and summoning between them rely entirely on the true intent of the Central Yellow—this is the wondrous function of the yang-sundial and moon-pearl within one’s own body. Hence it is said, *"Yin and Yang pair with the sun and moon; Water and Fire serve as their proof."*

This chapter focuses on the mutual resonance of the two things and the affinity of like *qi*, elucidating the fundamental principle of *Xing* and *Qing* in the *Great Change*. For stillness without movement is the essence of *Xing*; response leading to communion is the function of *Qing*. The *Qing* of Li ever resides in the North, while the *Qing* of Kan ever resides in the South—this is how the sun and moon unite as a bi-disc and how Water and Fire intermingle. When the true Water within Li returns to the North and the true Fire within Kan returns to the South, this is how Qian and Kun revert to their origin and how the *yinqie* is established.

The *Upper Canon* of the *Zhouyi* begins with Qian and Kun, taking their fixed positions to establish the essence. The *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* and *Heng*, taking their interaction to achieve function. The hexagram *Xian* depicts a marsh above a mountain, and Confucius’ commentary on it states, *"The two *qi* resonate and commune,"* and further, *"Heaven and Earth respond, and the myriad things are transformed and born."* Clearly, the world contains only these two *qi*: when they flow in harmony and resonate, they give life to beings; when they flow in reverse and resonate, they form the Elixir. Moreover, the two trigrams Dui and Gen precisely correspond to the upper and lower celestial arcs—employing the interactive function of Dui and Gen to restore the unchanging essence of Qian and Kun is no different from the mutual gathering of the yang-sundial and moon-pearl.

Alas! This is the true *Yi* inherent in every person.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Key to the Three Treasures**

The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—
Seal them tight, let no passage through.
The true person hides in the deep abyss,
Drifting and roaming, guarding the center’s rule.

Turning and bending to see and hear,
Opening and closing, all in accord.
They serve as the pivot and linchpin for the self,
In movement and stillness, never exhausted.

*Li*’s *qi* receives *rong* and *wei*,
*Kan* then ceases its hearing.
*Dui* closes, not with speech,
Silent words follow the primordial chaos.

Once these three are secured,
Relax the body in an empty chamber.
Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,
Take no-thought as the constant state.

Proof is unshaken by change,
The mind focused, not scattered.
In sleep, spirit and self embrace,
In waking, await the signs of presence and absence.

The complexion gradually moistens,
The bones and joints grow stronger.
Repelling all yin evils,
Only then is true yang established.

Practice without cease,
And the *qi* of clouds and rain will flow.
Gentle as spring rain,
Fluid as melting ice,
From head to foot it streams,
Then rises again in fullness,
Coming and going through the boundless void,
Pervading the valleys with subtle breath.

Reversion is the Dao’s verification,
Weakness is virtue’s handle.
Cultivate and clear the long-accumulated filth,
In the finest details, harmony is achieved.
The turbid is the path to clarity,
Prolonged darkness yields to brightness.

This chapter speaks of the key to the three treasures,
Inner reality matching outer response—
The essential work of nurturing one’s nature.

The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—
Seal them tight, let no passage through.
The true person hides in the deep abyss,
Drifting and roaming, guarding the center’s rule.

This section summarizes the essential Dao of securing the three treasures.
The cultivator of the Dao possesses inner and outer three treasures:
The inner three are original essence, original *qi*, and original spirit;
The outer three are ear, eye, and mouth.
To return the inner three treasures to truth,
All depends on the outer three not leaking—
As the *Yinfu Jing* states, “The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials.”
At the outset, one must withdraw hearing and dismiss sight,
Carefully seal the *Dui* mouth,
So the true origin does not leak outward.
Thus it is said: “The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—
Seal them tight, let no passage through.”

With the outer orifices unbreached,
The original spirit abides within.
Front and back converge,
And in the center, a positionless true person hides in the deep abyss.
The deep abyss is the North Culmen’s Great Abyss,
The dwelling of the celestial heart—
The original pass, the one orifice.
The original pass lies at the center of heaven and earth,
The exact middle of the four directions above and below,
A suspended cavity, boundless in vastness,
Infinitesimal in smallness—
This is called the center’s rule.
Within it is a master,
Called the true person.
Guard it without losing,
Called embracing the One.
Yet its subtlety lies entirely in non-action and non-idleness,
Neither forcing nor forgetting,
Possessing the image of drifting—
Thus it is said: “The true person hides in the deep abyss,
Drifting and roaming, guarding the center’s rule.”
These four lines are the essential work of nurturing one’s nature,
The guiding principle of the entire chapter.

Turning and bending to see and hear,
Opening and closing, all in accord.
They serve as the pivot and linchpin for the self,
In movement and stillness, never exhausted.

*Kan* belongs to water, the original gate;
*Li* belongs to fire, the female portal;
*Dui* is the mouth, corresponding internally to the square inch.
When the adept enters the chamber,
They should withdraw sight and return hearing,
Turning the usual into the reverse.
The opening and closing of these gates
All correspond to the inner orifice of the original female.
Thus it is said: “Turning and bending to see and hear,
Opening and closing, all in accord.”

Within *Kan* is received *wu*,
Within *Li* is received *ji*.
*Wu*-earth belongs to yang and governs movement;
*Li*-earth belongs to yin and governs stillness.
Though *Li*’s one yin body is still,
In truth it is easily moved,
Restless and shifting, uncontrollable.
Only by relying on the true yang emerging from *Kan* to restrain it—
Like a door’s pivot, a chariot’s linchpin—
Can opening and closing each have their time,
Movement and stillness each their proper moment,
And the original *qi* not be exhausted.
Thus it is said: “They serve as the pivot and linchpin for the self,
In movement and stillness, never exhausted.”

Within the original orifice, the primordial ancestral *qi*
Originally was undivided chaos.
Alas, it first emerges from *Li*, leaking its brightness;
Then from *Kan*, leaking its hearing;
And from *Dui*, opening its gate.
All three scatter without return—
How much of the primordial *qi* remains?
Only by silently lowering the inner screen,
Repeatedly reversing hearing,
Can the *qi* of *Kan* and *Li* not leak.
Thus it is said: “*Li*’s *qi* receives *rong* and *wei*,
*Kan* then ceases its hearing.”
Guard within, forget speech,
So the *qi* of the *Dui* mouth does not leak.
Thus it is said: “*Dui* closes, not with speech,
Silent words follow the primordial chaos.”
This is what is meant by “The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—
Seal them tight, let no passage through.”

The secret here lies entirely in the “mouth.”
This “mouth” is the original pass, the one orifice,
Swallowing and spitting forth heaven and earth.
Since the celestial mechanism cannot be fully revealed,
It is provisionally taken as the *Dui* image—
Not the mouth of eating and drinking in the world.
Only with a true teacher’s guidance can its subtlety be known.

Once these three are secured,
Relax the body in an empty chamber.
Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,
Take no-thought as the constant state.

This section details the work of hiding in the abyss and guarding the center.
Once the three—ear, eye, and mouth—are securely sealed,
Not a single thread leaks,
Then one’s true person naturally remains undisturbed and unconfused,
Roaming freely in the deep abyss.
Within, it is empty and vast,
Devoid of all things,
Like an empty chamber.
Thus it is said: “Once these three are secured,
Relax the body in an empty chamber.”

The primordial one *qi* originally comes from emptiness and nothingness.
One must entrust the will to it,
Awaiting it in emptiness.
Only when the six roots are fully stabilized,
Not a single thought arising,
Can resonance be achieved.

Yet this so-called "no-thought" is but constant responsiveness within stillness, never straying beyond the proper measure—far from the dull inertia of wood or stone. This "thought of no-thought" is the true thought; when true thought stands ever-present before one, only then may the primordial one *qi* be attained, and the moment of obtaining the medicine arrive. Thus it is said: "Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness, take no-thought as the constant state."

This matter is possessed by all, and in itself is no difficult attainment—like raising a pole and seeing its shadow. Yet the difficulty people face in attaining it lies precisely in the mind’s will not being concentrated, shifting moment by moment, scattering in a hundred directions, so that they gaze across the ocean and turn back. If, when entering the chamber, the mind’s will is single and unshifting, free from the malady of scattering, then it may be grasped in a single breath—what difficulty remains in attaining it? Thus it is said: "Attainment is difficult to shift; the mind, concentrated, does not scatter."

Once this mind remains unmoved, throughout the twelve hours—whether in motion, stillness, sitting, or lying—it never strays from the proper measure. Even when retiring at dusk to rest, as the primordial spirit naturally embraces the primordial *qi*, like a seed of fire within a furnace, one must remain ever awake and ever aware, inwardly illuminating the mind to observe the ebb and flow within the proper measure and to watch for the presence or absence of the true seed. Thus it is said: "In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; in wakefulness, one watches for its presence or absence." With such attentiveness, how can one fear the golden elixir will not coalesce or the true person fail to appear? This is the discipline of "the true person hidden in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the proper measure."

The complexion becomes increasingly moist,
The bones and joints grow ever stronger.
All yin evils are repelled,
And then the true yang is established.
If cultivation is unceasing,
The *qi* will course like clouds and rain.
Gentle as spring’s nourishing rain,
Flowing like melting ice,
From the head it streams down to the feet,
Then ultimately ascends again.
Coming and going through the boundless void,
Pervading the valleys with a subtle presence.

This section speaks of the signs of elixir formation. When the body and spirit, originally inseparable, receive the true seed, the inner and outer respond as one: naturally, the complexion becomes moist and radiant, the bones and joints grow strong, and the postnatal yin evils are expelled, establishing the primordial true yang *qi*. For within the body, all is yin evil; when the primordial yang *qi* arrives, yin evils naturally cannot remain. If cultivation is unceasing, its effects are divine: throughout the nine orifices, eight vessels, three hundred and sixty bones and joints, and eighty-four thousand pores, the great harmony of primordial *qi* circulates. One sees it move like clouds, descend like rain, moisten like spring’s nourishment, and flow like melting ice—from the Kunlun peak it descends to the feet, then from the Yongquan point it ascends back to the head, penetrating head and feet, coming and going through the boundless void without obstruction. For in heaven and earth, mountains, rivers, earth, and stone are all blocked and impassable, while only the hollow heavens and empty valleys are interconnected. The human body is the same: flesh and bones are blocked and impassable, while only the primordial apertures and empty valleys, vessel upon vessel, are interconnected, resembling the hollow heavens of creation. The primordial *qi* comes and goes, boundlessly pervading the empty valleys. Thus it is said: "Coming and going through the boundless void, subtly pervading the valleys."

This resembles the earlier passage: "The yellow center gradually opens its principle, moistening and nourishing the skin." Both describe the natural signs of the golden elixir.

Reversal is the verification of the Dao,
Weakness is the handle of virtue.
Cultivate to clear long-standing filth,
And in the finest details, harmony is achieved.
The turbid is the path to clarity,
Prolonged darkness leads to illumination.

This concludes by speaking of the golden elixir’s transcendence of the ordinary. What is reversal? The common Dao proceeds in accord, while the elixir Dao proceeds in reversal—overturning the Mysterious Female, embracing the One without separation, only then can one return to the root and restore life. Is this not "reversal is the verification of the Dao"? What is weakness? The strong and rigid are followers of death, while the soft and weak are followers of life. Concentrating *qi* to attain softness, becoming like an infant, naturally places the handle in one’s grasp. Is this not "weakness is the handle of virtue"?

Moreover, when yin evils are repelled, all long-standing filth within the body is thoroughly cultivated and removed. Once true yang is established, the primordial *qi* penetrates, and even the finest details are harmonized without obstruction. When the golden elixir first forms, the pulse halts and *qi* settles, returning to primordial chaos, re-entering the womb—this is the great death of the body. After a long time, one revives beyond all expectation, directly witnessing the original face, naturally attaining pure clarity, perfect wisdom, and all-pervading illumination, so that heaven and earth become a crystal palace. Thus it is said: "The turbid is the path to clarity, prolonged darkness leads to illumination."

The previous section spoke of the marvels of form; this section speaks of the marvels of spirit. Only when both form and spirit are marvelous can one unite with the Dao in truth. This chapter focuses on securing the three treasures, which is the first step in guarding the center and embracing the One—nurturing inner nature. It corresponds to the earlier chapter on refining the self and establishing the foundation.

**Appendix:**
Bao Yi Zi said: "When the ears do not listen, the Kan water within settles; when the eyes do not see, the Li fire within is nurtured; when the mouth does not speak, the Dui metal does not sound. Once these three are closed, the true person roams freely within."

He also said: "When the seven gates are returned, one nearly forgets life; all pulses sink, form and *qi* dissolve, strength fails to support, and one becomes as dull and turbid as if drunk. This is the verification of the Dao and the handle of virtue. Darkness is the foundation of brightness, turbidity is the source of clarity. From this point onward, perfect illumination, empty penetration, and spiritual communication all begin from darkness and turbidity."

Yu Yu Wu said: "Reversal means turning back. The verification of elixir cultivation lies in extreme emptiness and profound stillness, merging with heaven and earth, then the primordial *qi* returns from the first yang."

"‘Weak’ means soft and yielding. The handle of elixir cultivation lies in holding fast to one’s resolve and not violently disturbing one’s *qi*, being as soft and yielding as an infant—only then can one return to the root and revert to the origin."

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Chapter on Heterodox Schools Achieving Nothing (Title follows tradition)**

The world delights in petty arts,
Not discerning the Dao’s depth or shallowness.
Abandoning the true to follow deviant paths,
They seek swift results but meet obstruction and blockage.
Like the blind without a staff to lean on,
Or the deaf listening to gong and shang notes,
Diving into water to hunt pheasants and hares,
Or scaling mountains to seek fish and dragons,
Planting wheat yet hoping for millet,
Or wielding a compass to draw a square—
They exhaust their strength and labor their spirits,
Yet through the years see no achievement.

To know the method of *fushi* (internal alchemy),
It is most concise and not cumbersome.
This chapter decisively declares the futility of heterodox schools.

Those who study the Dao must first understand:
The Dao and mere techniques differ as heaven from earth.
The complete cultivation of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life),
Returning to the boundless, is called the Great Dao.
A single mechanism, a single trick,
Incapable of self-salvation, is called a petty art.

The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is hard to encounter yet easy to accomplish;
All heterodox schools and petty arts are easy to encounter yet hard to accomplish.
Alas! The foolish people of the world have minds choked with weeds:
Not only do they fail to distinguish depth from shallowness,
Their vision blurred,
But they also cannot discern the true from the deviant.
Often they turn their backs on light to grope in darkness,
Abandoning the true to follow the false.
Originally seeking swift results,
They instead meet obstruction and blockage,
Forever severing the path to the Dao—
Is this not lamentable?

Unknowing that the precelestial *xing* and *ming* transcend form and instrument,
They mistakenly grasp at postcelestial essence and *qi*,
Groping within the body,
Lost and without trace,
Tossed about by others’ delusions,
Utterly without discernment—
This is like the blind without a staff to lean on,
Or the deaf listening to gong and shang notes.

Failing to realize that precelestial yin and yang are of the same kind as oneself,
They guess them to be worldly men and women,
Seeking them externally,
Drifting into licentiousness and depravity,
Harming life and corrupting virtue—
Nothing is more grievous.
This is like entering water to hunt pheasants and hares,
Or scaling mountains to seek fish and dragons.

Not considering that precelestial lead and mercury are originally without substance or form,
They go about burning thatch and playing with fire,
Refining mercury to transmute copper,
Deceiving and bewildering the foolish,
Ruining themselves and destroying their families—
This is like planting wheat yet hoping for millet,
Or wielding a compass while vainly seeking a square.

These heterodox schools expend a lifetime of effort,
Toiling year after year,
Yet in old age achieve nothing.
Instead, they slander the ancestral masters as liars,
Unknowing that the method of the Golden Elixir’s *fushi*
Is most simple and essential:
With *youwei* (action) to trace back to the origin,
And *wuwei* (non-action) to grasp the end,
Its function is one with the creation of heaven and earth.
Even the dullest of men, upon obtaining it,
Instantly ascends to sagehood—
How can it be mentioned in the same breath as heterodox schools and petty arts?

This discussion of the faults of heterodox schools merely outlines the general points.
To exhaustively examine them:
The Chan school has ninety-six kinds of external paths,
The Yuan teachings have three thousand six hundred heterodox schools—
A thousand differences, ten thousand divergences,
Impossible to enumerate fully.
Thus, the Patriarch of Zhengyang composed the *Song of the True Dao*,
The Perfected of Cuixu wrote the *Luofu Lament*,
And extending to Li Qing’an’s *Nine Grades Discourse*
And Chen Guanwu’s *Song of Resolving Delusion*—
All meticulously detail the errors of heterodox schools and external paths,
To awaken the deaf and blind of the world.
Alas! The world does not awaken,
And these deluded traditions continue to spread,
Increasing without end—
Truly pitiable.

The above merely sketches the broad strokes.
One should select the essential sayings of the perfected,
And compile a separate work, *Guide for the Lost*,
To be studied together with like-minded seekers.

This scroll focuses exclusively on *fushi* (subduing and ingesting), wherein the governance of governance and the nurturing of nature are already implicit—its meaning aligns with the preceding section.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Flowing Pearl and Golden Flower**

The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man.
Suddenly obtaining the golden flower, it turns and interrelates,
Transforming into a white liquid, congealing to utmost firmness.

The golden flower takes the lead; in but a moment,
It dissolves and transforms into water—jade-like horse’s teeth,
The Yang then moves to harmonize, nature and emotion in spontaneity.

Pressing upon the timely Yin, restraining and enclosing the forbidden gate,
The compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness,
The stern father issues commands, instructing and admonishing descendants.

The Five Phases vie for dominance, each relying on the other to arise;
Fire’s nature melts metal, metal fells wood to flourish.

The Three and Five unite as one—the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth.
This may be transmitted orally, yet is difficult to convey in writing.

You must turn to the right, at noon rotate eastward;
Mao and You form the boundary, host and guest assume their names.

The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence,
Both feed upon each other, compelled to merge,
Then interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another.

When Yinghuo guards the west and Taibai traverses the heavens,
Wherever the killing qi descends, what can remain unoverturned?
The foxhound guards the rat, the sparrow fears the kestrel—
Each fulfills its nature; how dare they utter a sound?

This chapter speaks of the wood-nature and metal-emotion spontaneously uniting to accomplish the work of *fushi*.

The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man.
Suddenly obtaining the golden flower, it turns and interrelates,
Transforming into a white liquid, congealing to utmost firmness.

This passage describes the union of the natures and emotions of two substances to form the golden elixir.

The primordial body is nature and life—this is Qian and Kun.
The post-celestial function is nature and emotion—this is Kan and Li.
Since Qian and Kun shattered into Kan and Li,
The function of nature and emotion became manifest while the body of nature and life receded.
Following this, one becomes ordinary.
Only when Kan and Li re-unite as Qian and Kun,
Using the function of nature and emotion to restore the body of nature and life,
Reversing this, one becomes sagely.

Within the post-celestial Kan and Li, body and function further divide:
True Yin and True Yang constitute the body, which pertains to water and fire;
The qi of the two meridians constitutes the function, which pertains to metal and wood.
This distinction must not be confused.

Qian pertains to the True Nature of the Great Yang, originally quiescent and unmoving.
Yet upon merging with Kun’s single Yin, nature transforms into emotion,
Becoming the wood-mercury within Li.
From this point, Yin essence prevails,
Li’s light flows outward in compliance,
Flickering and unstable, assuming the form of a flowing pearl.
Once Qian becomes Li, its single Yang enters the Kun palace.
Kun pertains to the Primordial Life of the Great Yin.
Upon receiving Qian’s single Yang, life transforms into nature,
Becoming the metal-lead within Kan.
This speck of golden qi’s essence lies hidden within Kan’s water,
Profound and unfathomable, assuming the form of the golden flower.

Li’s numinous substance constantly circulates, inherently prone to flee and difficult to grasp.
The more urgently one seizes it, the swifter it departs.
Fortunately, Kan’s single True Lead reverses its course to restrain it.
Upon encountering True Lead, True Mercury no longer flees.
Thus it is said: “The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man.
Suddenly obtaining the golden flower, it turns and interrelates.”

When lead enters mercury, mercury relies on lead’s restraint,
While lead also gains mercury’s transformative power.
The two substances meet in the Yellow Chamber, merging into a single qi.
This qi first becomes liquid, then congeals,
Hence it is said: “Transforming into a white liquid, congealing to utmost firmness.”
White is the color of metal; utmost firmness is the nature of metal.
When metal returns to nature, the elixir is already formed.
This is the guiding principle of the entire chapter.

The golden flower takes the lead; in but a moment,
It dissolves and transforms into water—jade-like horse’s teeth.
The Yang then moves to harmonize, nature and emotion in spontaneity.

This passage describes the two substances spontaneously uniting and harmonizing in turn.
The Kan male takes the lead, the Li female responds.
Kan’s single Yang is inherently difficult to extract from the furnace,
Yet when the time arrives, it emerges in but a finger-snap.
Thus it is said: “The golden flower takes the lead; in but a moment.”
Metal born within water can itself transform into water—
The liquid of the golden flower is the True One’s water.
Vibrant and dynamic, formless yet generating form,
It gradually solidifies, resembling the jade-like teeth of a horse.
Thus it is said: “Dissolves and transforms into water—jade-like horse’s teeth.”

Once Kan’s golden liquid ascends, Li’s wood liquid follows to harmonize with it.
East and west, long separated,
Fortunately, True Intention draws them to meet in the Yellow Chamber.
Wood-nature loves metal, metal-emotion yearns for wood.
One leads, the other responds, arising from the spontaneity of nature and emotion,
Not something that can be forced by human effort.
Thus it is said: “The Yang then moves to harmonize, nature and emotion in spontaneity.”
The Yang here refers to the flowing pearl of the Great Yang mentioned above.
Externally Yang yet internally Yin, it readily follows things and flees,
Responding rather than leading.
Only when paired with the True Yang of the golden flower as husband and wife
Does it cease to flee.
At this point, it has transformed into True Yin,
Thus possessing the marvel of the wife’s path overturned—
This must not be overlooked.

Pressing upon the timely Yin, restraining and enclosing the forbidden gate,
The compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness,
The stern father issues commands, instructing and admonishing descendants.

This passage describes restraining the two substances to meet in the Central Palace and produce the true seed.
Once Kan’s golden flower ascends, Li’s flowing pearl descends.
The qi of the two meridians unite in a single moment—
The time must not be lost.
One must press upon it with True Intention.
When the two substances unite, precisely at the midpoint between Xu and Wei,
One should seal the earthly gate and gather the true qi,
Allowing not the slightest leakage.
Thus it is said: “Pressing upon the timely Yin, restraining and enclosing the forbidden gate.”
Once the true seed returns to the earthen cauldron,
It relies entirely on the Kun mother of the Central Palace for warmth and nourishment.
Initially, the mother attends to the child, like a hen brooding her eggs, constantly embracing them.
Later, the child yearns for the mother, like the kind bird returning food, never parting for a moment.
Thus it is said: “The compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness.”

Once the true seed resides in the Central Palace,
The outer defenses must be strictly guarded—
Firmly sealing the eight gates, encircling and closing them tight,
Not allowing the slightest slack.
This is like a child in infancy:
Nurture depends on the compassionate mother,
While discipline relies entirely on the stern father.
Thus it is said: *“The stern father issues commands, instructing descendants.”*

The compassionate mother is likened to the civil fire,
Warming and nourishing within the chamber of spirit;
The stern father is likened to the martial fire,
Fortifying the gates and barriers.
The filial child is the true seed—
The golden flower and flowing pearl,
The two substances conjoined.

From the pressing of timely Yin to this point,
All pertains to the work of the golden elixir,
Accomplished in a single moment.
The five phases intermingle in sovereign reversal,
Mutually sustaining to generate life—
Fire’s nature melts metal, metal’s edge fosters wood’s flourishing.
Three and five merge as one,
The essence of heaven and earth.
This may be conveyed through oral transmission,
But cannot be set down in writing.

This passage speaks of the marvel of the five phases in inversion during elixir-making.
In the common Dao, the five phases follow sequential generation—
Metal engenders water, wood engenders fire—
Flowing unchecked, vital qi inevitably scatters,
Bringing one ever closer to death,
Turning life’s mechanism into one of destruction.
This is what is meant by *“the living are the root of death.”*

In the Dao of the elixir, the five phases are entirely reversed:
The flowing pearl, originally the wood dragon,
Is drawn from the fire of Li;
The golden flower, originally the metal tiger,
Is drawn from the water of Kan.
Water and fire interpenetrate, metal and wood invert—
Only then can one return to the root and restore life,
Preserving it for kalpas without end,
Turning the mechanism of destruction into one of generation.
This is what is meant by *“the dead are the root of life.”*
Thus it is said: *“The five phases intermingle in sovereign reversal, mutually sustaining to generate life.”*

*Sovereign reversal* means the north-south axis of Zi and Wu,
Interchanging as the fundamental framework;
*Mutual sustaining* means the east-west alignment of dragon and tiger,
Establishing the weft of Mao and You.
By the logic of the common Dao,
Metal lies dormant in ore, unable to emerge on its own;
Wood, laden with yin qi, how could it flourish?
First, one must employ the fire within southern wood
To smelt the metal within northern water,
Refining the ore to reveal the golden flower.
Then, one must use the metal within western water
To restrain the wood within eastern fire,
Cutting away yin qi so that wood’s essence may flourish.
Thus it is said: *“Fire’s nature melts metal, metal’s edge fosters wood’s flourishing.”*
This is the essence of *“the five phases intermingle in sovereign reversal, mutually sustaining to generate life.”*

East’s three and south’s two combine to form one five,
North’s one and west’s four combine to form one five,
The true earth of the central palace naturally forms one five—
This is called *“three fives merge, south and north unite, east and west gather within the central earth.”*
This is what is meant by *“one, three, and five unite as one—
The most refined and wondrous principle of creation.”*
Grasping heaven and earth, encompassing the River and Luo,
Its workings must be transmitted orally by a true teacher—
How could they be committed to writing?
Thus it is said: *“Three and five merge as one, the essence of heaven and earth.
This may be conveyed through oral transmission,
But cannot be set down in writing.”*

This passage speaks of inverting the two substances,
So that the five phases return to oneness.
The *Model and Image* chapter of the final section states:
*“Originally but two things—
In the end, three and five.
Three and five merge as one—
All gather in a single place.”*
The verification is clear.

Zi turns to the right, Wu rotates to the east,
Mao and You form the boundary,
Giving rise to the names of host and guest.
This passage speaks of the separation between metal and wood,
And the need to apply the work of bathing.
By the logic of the common Dao’s five phases,
Wood is born in Hai, the thunderous wood arises from Kan water—
This is called *“the dragon emerges from water.”*
Metal is born in Si, the joyous metal is produced from Li fire—
This is called *“the tiger is born from fire.”*

In the inverted Dao of the elixir, it is otherwise:
From Zi, turning right to Wei,
From north to west, and thence to south,
With You metal concealed within,
The golden flower is produced in Kan,
Becoming the qi of the upper arc—
This is called *“the tiger is born from water.”*
From Wu, rotating left to Chou,
From south to east, and thence to north,
With Mao wood concealed within,
The flowing pearl is drawn from Li,
Becoming the qi of the lower arc—
This is called *“the dragon emerges from fire.”*

Yet when Zi is south and Wu is north,
At the moment water and fire intermingle,
One metal and one wood stand as boundaries between them.
Wood’s nature, in the east, serves as host;
Metal’s disposition, in the west, serves as guest.
Inevitably, nature and disposition become estranged,
Host and guest fall into discord.
At this time, one must apply the method of bathing—
Emptying all conditions, leaving not a single thread,
Preserving true intention within the compass,
Harmonizing metal’s disposition with wood’s nature.

When metal returns to the east, becoming host,
And wood returns to the west, becoming guest,
Host and guest exchange their names,
And the qi of the two arcs finally unite as one.

These two—nature and disposition—
In their mutual resonance, are husband and wife;
In their mutual generation, are mother and child;
In their mutual restraint, are father and son;
In their mutual exchange, are host and guest.
Ever shifting, unfathomable—
This is the essence of heaven and earth’s most refined principle.

The dragon calls to the tiger,
The tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.
The two feast upon each other,
Forcing their union,
Then interlock and swallow,
Chewing and devouring one another.
This passage speaks of the merging of the two substances.

Once the five phases are mutually sustained
And host and guest have exchanged places,
The wood dragon, now occupying the position of You,
Calls forth the qi of the black tiger;
The metal tiger, now occupying the position of Mao,
Inhales the essence of the red dragon.
Thus it is said: *“The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.”*
Thereupon, their natures and dispositions become entangled,
Indulging in unrestrained union,
Feasting upon each other,
Merging as one.
At the moment of their union,
They interlock and swallow,
Taking into the mouth and forming the elixir the size of a millet grain.

This passage speaks of the mutual union of the two substances, emerging from the preceding discussion of their interdependence, and specifically expounds the meaning of "consumption." When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the heavens, the killing qi descends—how could anything not collapse? The wildcat watches the mouse, and birds fear the goshawk; each follows its nature—how dare they make a sound?

This section describes the mutual restraint of the two substances. As the five phases clash in dominance, fire’s nature can melt metal, thus fire enters the western metal domain, forming the image of Mars guarding the west. Metal’s nature can fell wood, thus metal seizes the eastern wood position, forming the image of Venus traversing the heavens. Fire overcomes metal, and metal in turn overcomes wood, completing a rightward cycle where nothing escapes conquest—yet this is achieved through counter-restriction, employing only the mechanism of destruction. Hence it is said: *“When the killing qi descends, how could anything not collapse?”* When wood encounters metal and metal encounters fire, their natures and dispositions are naturally subdued, like the wildcat seizing the mouse or birds fearing the goshawk—at first sight, they are captured, and both fall silent without a sound. This is not forced silence but their inherent nature. Once each has attained its restraining nature, how dare they make a sound?

This passage speaks of the mutual binding and restraint of the two substances, emerging from the preceding discussion of the five phases’ conflicting dominion, and specifically expounds the meaning of "submission." For only when they unite without hindering their mutual restraint does the vital mechanism reside within the destructive mechanism. And only through restraint can they achieve union, thus reversing the destructive mechanism into the vital mechanism. The alternation of submission and consumption fulfills the great meaning of "submission and consumption" in the *Returning Elixir* chapter—this is abundantly clear, far removed from the so-called "ingestion techniques" of heterodox schools.

**Appendix:**
Master Baoyi Zi said: *“Human life resides in Mao. The sun rises in Mao, and the myriad things depend on it to live—thus all things rely on the essence of the great yang to establish their lives. The flowing pearl of the great yang is the treasure of life. Yet this life-treasure, when lodged in spirit, becomes restless and scattered in thought; when lodged in essence, it is preserved but difficult to sustain. Hence it is said to ‘constantly depart from man’—it must be subdued by the golden flower.”* (From *Chapter Twenty-Five: Discerning Authenticity and Falsehood*)

Without grasping its principles, one should not speak recklessly. Exhausting family wealth, leaving wives and children hungry and impoverished—from ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path, yet few have met with success, and even fewer have achieved completion. Seeking rare medicines far and wide only leads one astray from the Dao.

If, however, one truly encounters the Way and perceives its beginnings and threads, then by analogy one may weigh the nature of things from start to finish. The five phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains the nourishing fluid, while the father governs bestowal and reception; essence congeals and form flows, enduring like metal and stone without decay. If one discerns the true and does not leak it, one attains the correct Dao—like a pole casting its shadow at once, or a voice echoing through the valley. How can this not be wondrous? It is the supreme image of Heaven and Earth.

Yet if one takes but an inch of wild aconite or a tael of croton seed, swallowing it will cause one to collapse, unable to rise or bow. At such a moment, even if King Wen cast the yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted the hexagrams, Bian Que wielded his needles, or Wu Xian beat his drums, how could they revive the fallen or restore them to swift movement?

This chapter speaks of the Dao’s truth and falsehood, urging one to discern the false and preserve the true.

Without grasping its principles, one should not speak recklessly. Exhausting family wealth, leaving wives and children hungry and impoverished—from ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path, yet few have met with success, and even fewer have achieved completion. Seeking rare medicines far and wide only leads one astray from the Dao. If, however, one truly encounters the Way and perceives its beginnings and threads, then by analogy one may weigh the nature of things from start to finish. This passage speaks of the truth and falsehood in "submission and consumption," which those who study the Dao must discern early on.

The great Dao of the Golden Elixir encompasses Heaven and Earth, embracing the images of the *Yi*; its principles are vast, profound, and subtle. One must thoroughly understand yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation before grasping its mysteries. How could those who fail to grasp its principles dare to speak or act recklessly?

Those who speak and act without understanding often drift into the arts of furnace and fire, depleting their family wealth and leaving their wives and children starving, yet still they do not awaken—truly pitiable. From ancient times to the present, those who have loved the Dao number in the thousands of millions, but those who love it do not necessarily encounter it, and those who encounter it do not necessarily complete it. Seekers of the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who achieve it are as rare as rabbit horns. This is because they abandon their own nature and life, instead entering the mountains to seek mercury or digging in the earth for lead, collecting the five metals and eight minerals, mistaking them for the medicine of immortality—thus straying entirely from the great Dao.

When students seek teachers and inquire into the Dao, they must first possess a discerning eye. If they encounter a potential master, they must examine the origins and threads of their teachings to determine whether they are true or false. If the teacher is genuine, they will certainly have a thorough understanding of yin and yang and a deep grasp of creation’s workings. Simply inquire into the root of nature and life, the principle of like attracting like, and the reversal of the five phases from beginning to end—if not a single point is unclear, then the authenticity of the medicine can be weighed, and the authenticity of the teacher’s lineage can likewise be determined. Thus it is said: *"By analogy one may weigh the nature of things from start to finish."*

The five phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains the nourishing fluid, while the father governs bestowal and reception; essence congeals and form flows, enduring like metal and stone without decay. If one discerns the true and does not leak it, one attains the correct Dao—like a pole casting its shadow at once, or a voice echoing through the valley. How can this not be wondrous? It is the supreme image of Heaven and Earth.

This passage speaks of the reverse overcoming of the five phases to conjoin the Great Elixir—precisely the visible thread of the true method. In the common Dao, the five phases take mutual generation as father and mother; in the Elixir Dao, they instead take mutual overcoming as father and mother. For without overcoming, there can be no generation—killing is precisely where life resides. Take metal overcoming wood: when metal stirs, it immediately generates water. Wood qi, greedy for water’s life, forgets metal’s overcoming. The overcomer becomes the father, and that which overcomes yet generates becomes the mother. Extend this to the five phases, and none is not so. Thus it is said: *"The five phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother."*

The mother’s way belongs to *kun*, governing nurturance, its virtue lying in quiescent gathering. At the moment of union, having received the true seed from the *qian* father, it nurtures within the Central Palace, gradually forming the infant. Thus it is said: *"The mother contains the nourishing fluid."* The mother embodies the principle of greed for life and forgetfulness of overcoming—this is the *"compassionate mother’s nurturance"* spoken of in the previous chapter. The father’s way belongs to *qian*, governing inception, its virtue lying in dynamic directness. At the first encounter, qi spreads and essence flows, bestowing generative qi upon the *kun* mother—this is the true seed. Thus it is said: *"The father governs bestowal and reception."* The father embodies the principle of overcoming as generation—this is the *"stern father’s decree"* spoken of in the previous chapter.

One generates, one overcomes: bestowal congeals the essence of inception, while nurturance flows forth the form of sustenance. When these two wondrously unite, the true embryo is formed—this is the *"five phases interlocked in sovereignty, mutually sustaining life"* spoken of in the previous chapter. At this stage of practice, advancing without cease, the dharma-body attains endurance like metal and stone, imperishable. Only by discerning the true and remaining utterly steadfast, without the slightest leakage, can one achieve the supreme Dao.

From beginning to end, it is simply taking overcoming as generation that reveals the marvel of the five phases’ inversion. Once this marvel is grasped, the Great Elixir is immediately accomplished. It is like a pole casting its shadow at once, or a voice echoing through the valley—this is the natural image of creation’s workings. How could it not be supremely efficacious and verifiable? These are the proofs of the true Dao, its thread visible to the eye—how could heterodox arts and false techniques be confused with it?

Consider the wild aconite of an inch or the croton seed of a tael: once swallowed, the body stiffens, unable to bend or rise. At such a time, even if Zhou Wen were casting yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreting omens, Bian Que wielding needles, or Wu Xian beating drums, could they revive the dead and restore them to running and walking? This passage shifts to another analogy to demonstrate the wondrous efficacy of the ingested elixir.

People know only that poison taken by mouth kills and cannot be revived, yet do not realize that the Golden Elixir taken by mouth grants life that cannot die. Poison taken by mouth, though even sages cannot revive the dead, yet when the Golden Elixir enters the mouth, could even the Creator cause one to die again? Alas that people are enlightened to the one yet utterly benighted to the other! Once the Golden Elixir has entered the mouth, even if one were fed wild aconite or croton seeds, they could not kill. Thus the marvel of the five phases’ overcoming, congealing essence and flowing form, and the ingested elixir’s efficacy is like a pole casting its shadow at once, or a voice echoing through the valley—how can it be equated with false paths lacking the true seed?

This chapter specially distinguishes the true and false of elixir ingestion, opening a single eye for learners of the Dao through the ages, lest they be deceived by blind teachers.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Lead and Mercury Conjoin**

The River Maid is numinous and most spirit-like. When fire is applied, she flies away, leaving no trace of dust. Like a ghost hidden or a dragon concealed, none know where she abides. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as root.

Things lacking yin and yang violate Heaven and contravene the Origin. A hen hatching her own egg—her chick will not be whole. Why is this? Union is not yet complete; the Three and Five have not merged; hardness and softness remain apart. The way of transformation follows Heaven and Earth’s nature. Fire moves upward in flame, water flows downward in moisture—not by any master’s guidance do they behave thus. The governance of inception is correct and cannot be altered.

Observe the moment of male and female union: hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without any craft or control. The male crouches at birth, the female lowers her body, receiving qi at the outset within the womb—not only at birth is this visible, but even at death, they replicate it. This is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union, fixed at the very beginning.

This chapter speaks of true lead and true mercury, two substances restraining and employing one another.

The River Maid is numinous and most spirit-like. When fire is applied, she flies away, leaving no trace of dust. Like a ghost hidden or a dragon concealed, none know where she abides. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout serves as root.

This passage speaks of using lead to restrain mercury—this is the work of the Golden Elixir. *Li* is originally the *qian* body of Grand Yang, the origin of nature. Within it lies a single yin, the true water of *kun*—this is true mercury. As it encloses the feminine within the masculine, it is also called the River Maid. *Kan* is originally the *kun* body of Grand Yin, the origin of life. Within it lies a single yang, the true metal of *qian*—this is true lead. As it generates metal within water, it is also called the Yellow Sprout.

The River Maid symbolizes the postnatal heart. The prenatal nature is originally quiescent and unmoving; transformed into the postnatal heart, it responds to stimuli, pervading Heaven and Earth with utmost numinosity and spirit. In an instant, it traverses the four directions, past and future, without limit. Thus it is said: *"The River Maid is numinous and most spirit-like."* In terms of celestial divisions, *wu* belongs to the Three Rivers’ region, the abode of *li* fire. It also embodies the meaning of desire flowing with the current. The human heart is inherently numinous, but entangled with postnatal emotions and perceptions, it readily chases after things. Thus, when encountering circumstances, it stirs; when meeting conditions, it arises—ceaselessly turning, never pausing. This is just like common mercury: at the sight of fire, it immediately flees, leaving no shadow or trace, impossible to grasp. Thus it is said: *"When fire is applied, she flies away, leaving no trace of dust."* At the moment of flight, like a hidden ghost or a concealed dragon, even a sage cannot fathom its comings and goings—this is what Confucius meant by *"entering and exiting without fixed time, none know its dwelling."*

The River Maid’s division continues...

Thus it is said: *"Hidden as a ghost, concealed as a dragon—none know where it abides."* The River Maid is the yin within *li*, hence she takes the image of a ghost; the yin within *li* originally pertains to Wood Mercury, thus she also takes the image of a dragon. Such is the ease with which numinous mercury is lost and the difficulty of holding it—one must seek the method of restraint and subjugation. Only true lead from *kan* will suffice, for the single yang within *kan* originally emerges from pure gold, being of the same kind as oneself. Following it leads to the flow of emotions, but reversing it turns it into nature. When metal returns to nature, one reverts to the root and restores the origin. The Yellow Sprout then unites with the River Maid, like a ruler governing a minister or a husband restraining a wife, naturally remaining unmoved. As Zhang Pingshu said: *"One must seek the Metal Elder for restraint."* Thus it is said: *"To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root."* This speaks specifically of the mutual restraint between two substances, sharing the same purport as the earlier "flowing pearl and golden radiance."

Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and defy the Origin; a hen hatching eggs on its own will not produce complete chicks. Why is this so? Because union is incomplete, the Three and Five do not merge, and hardness and softness remain apart. The Way of transformation follows the spontaneity of Heaven and Earth. This passage speaks of the error in cultivating a single substance alone.

The Dao is called the interplay of one yin and one yang. Any thing that is purely yin without yang or purely yang without yin violates the principle of *qian* as the source of origination and *kun* as the source of generation. Hence it is said: *"Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and defy the Origin."* When a hen broods over eggs, it first infuses a single point of true yang within, gradually incubating it to form a chick. But if there is only the female without the male, the chick will never form. Why is this? Because solitary yin lacks yang, and union remains incomplete.

In the Dao of elixir refinement, it is likewise: the East’s three and the South’s two must unite with the North’s one and the West’s four, the Four Symbols merging into two substances, which then converge at the Central True Earth. Only when like seeks like and the three and five combine is the sacred embryo formed. If the qi of the three and five fail to merge, it remains but solitary yin and orphaned yang, one hardness and one softness, each sundered and scattered—how then could the true embryo take shape?

For yang governs the bestowal of essence, while yin governs its transformation—this is the natural Way of Heaven and Earth, the interplay of one yin and one yang. Whether in the formation of a mortal embryo or a sacred one, the workings of creation are the same; it is self-evident that one cannot cultivate a single substance alone. Yet this very interplay of yin and yang is none other than the original true nature and true destiny of *qian* as the source of origination and *kun* as the source of generation. Only when both are cultivated and realized together is it called the Great Way of the Golden Elixir. To cultivate destiny without cultivating nature, or nature without cultivating destiny, is to violate Heaven and defy the Origin—such deluded paths often lead to the practice of "absorption and replenishment," which is no different from fleeing drowning only to leap into fire. Alas!

Fire moves and flames upward; water flows and moistens downward. Without a teacher’s guidance, they act thus of themselves. The source of origination governs correctness, and it cannot be altered. This passage speaks of the two substances merging, each returning to its original nature.

The functions of true yin and true yang are best exemplified by water and fire. Fire’s nature is yang and governs movement, and movement must flame upward; water’s nature is yin and governs flow, and flow must moisten downward. How could these be like sentient beings, who follow a teacher’s instruction to act thus? From the very beginning of their origination, the moistening nature of water and the flaming nature of fire were each firmly established in their correctness—how could they be altered later? Observe creation, and you will understand your own body.

The fire within *kan* in our body constantly seeks dryness and flames upward, inheriting the nature of the Father *qian*; the water within *li* constantly flows toward moisture and moistens downward, inheriting the nature of the Mother *kun*. As we have received these natures, so too must we return them to their origin. This is why the *kan* male and *li* female each return to their root, and why the Father *qian* and Mother *kun* each restore their beginning.

As *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Water can flow, fire can flame—within the body, this can be verified."* This is what it means.

Observe the moment when male and female unite: hardness and softness bind together inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without any artifice to control them. The male lies prone, the female bends her body—this is how they receive the initial qi in the womb, not merely at birth when it becomes visible. Even in death, they replicate this pattern, yet this is not something parents teach them. It is determined at the moment of union, fixed from the very beginning.

This passage uses the union of man and woman to illustrate the return of *kan* and *li* to their root. To understand the principle of water flowing and fire moving, observe it in the ways of the world: when a man and woman unite, naturally the hard is above and the soft below, binding as firmly as if sealed by tally, unalterably fixed. How could this be the result of some skilled craftsmanship? It has been thus from the moment of their birth.

When a man is born, his body must lie prone—proneness signifies a nature and disposition invariably turned inward. When a woman is born, her body must recline—reclining signifies a nature and disposition invariably turned outward. From the moment of receiving *qi* within the parents’ womb, one hard and one soft, their physical constitutions are already fixed, merely becoming visible after birth. Yet this is not only apparent at birth; it remains so even in death. When people drown, men still lie prone and women still recline—this is not because parents have diligently instructed them to do so. Rather, at the moment of their parents’ union, the hard occupied the upper position, forming the image of *qian*-Dao becoming male; the soft occupied the lower position, forming the image of *kun*-Dao becoming female. The positions of male and female were already determined in the womb, and after birth, their reclining and proneness remain fixed, no different from the moment of their union.

Once one understands the ways of the world, one grasps the application of the Dao. The *qian* above and *kun* below in the primordial state are the father and mother of our bodies; the *li* above and *kan* below in the later state are the male and female of our bodies. Fire’s nature is to flame upward—this is the disposition of the *kan*-male. Water’s nature is to moisten downward—this is the disposition of the *li*-female. The dispositions of the *kan*-male and *li*-female are the dispositions of the *qian*-father and *kun*-mother. *Qian* is inherently fixed in the upper position, *kun* in the lower. When *qian*-father and *kun*-mother unite to form *kan* and *li*, their positions shift, but their dispositions remain unchanged. Thus, the fire within *kan* still strives to flame upward, and the water within *li* still strives to moisten downward, each seeking to return to its root and revert to its kind. When the *kan*-male and *li*-female unite once more, they naturally restore the constant order of heaven above and earth below, and the primordial *xing*-nature and *ming*-life are recovered.

The union of *qian* and *kun* to form *kan* and *li* is like the initial birth of male and female, one reclining and one prone—this is the inherent endowment. The reunion of *kan* and *li* to form *qian* and *kun* is like the death of male and female, still one reclining and one prone—this is the return to the origin. As it is said, “Each receives its beginning and assumes its proper place, never to be altered again.”

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Refining the Hun and Po**

The *kan*-male is the moon; the *li*-female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, and its body suffers no harm.

When yang loses its harmony, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the dark and new moons, they press close and eclipse, covering and overwhelming one another. Yang’s form diminishes, and yin’s encroachment brings calamity. Male and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nourish. When the feminine and masculine intermingle, they seek their kind.

Metal transforms into water, and water’s nature flows freely. Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot move. The male moves and extends outward; the female is still and conceals within. If the measure overflows or the rhythm is transgressed, the female restrains it. The *po* governs the *hun*, preventing excess.

Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in due time, each attains harmony and together they manifest the sign. This chapter speaks of the mutual regulation of the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* to form the Golden Elixir.

The *kan*-male is the moon; the *li*-female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, and its body suffers no harm. This passage reveals the profound mystery of the sun and moon’s union and their inverted mutual employment.

In the alchemical Dao, *kan* and *li* are the medicinal substances—namely, the sun’s *hun* and the moon’s *po*. In the workings of creation, the sun and moon reflect each other, mutually containing the celestial *hun* and terrestrial *po*. In the human body, water and fire achieve harmony, mutually drawing the sun’s light and the moon’s essence. The principle of their mutual regulation is one and the same.

The previous chapter used the male’s prone birth and the female’s reclining body as an allegory for the two entities, *kan* and *li*. The male is positioned externally yet faces inward; the female is positioned internally yet faces outward. The marvel of their inverted images is already contained within. *Kan* belongs to the true water of the north, corresponding to the moon in the heavens. The moon is the essence of *tai*-yin water, an image of *kun*—it should be called female, yet it contains the *qian*-household’s true fire of *tai*-yang within its *po*, its *hun* within its *po*, taking the image of the Jade Hare, and so it is instead male. *Li* belongs to the true fire of the south, corresponding to the sun in the heavens. The sun is the essence of *tai*-yang fire, an image of *qian*—it should be called male, yet it contains the true water of the *kun*-palace within its *hun*, its *po* within its *hun*, taking the image of the Golden Crow, and so it is instead female. This is the marvel of inversion described in the *Wuzhen Pian*: “The sun resides in the *li* position yet becomes female; the moon is paired with the Toad Palace yet is male.”

The *li* body is originally *qian*. The *qian*-father moves and is positioned externally, yet when transformed into the *li*-female, its disposition turns entirely inward. Thus, though the sun’s light primarily functions externally, it constantly reflects back with *tai*-yin, gathering a single yang light within the yin *po*. The *li* body turns outward into inward, hence it is said, “The sun bestows virtue.” The *kan* body is originally *kun*. The *kun*-mother is still and positioned internally, yet when transformed into the *kan*-male, its disposition turns entirely outward. Thus, though the moon’s essence is primarily concealed within, it constantly responds to the *qi* of *tai*-yang, and the entire body of yin *po* borrows the yang *hun* for its light. The *kan* body turns inward into outward, hence it is said, “The moon unfurls its light.”

In terms of inversion, that which enters within is female, and that which extends outward is male. In terms of their original bodies, that which emits essence is male, and that which receives transformation is female. Though the two entities, *kan* and *li*, are inverted, they do not lose their original bodies. Thus, at the conjunction of the dark and new moons, the sun and moon meet along the ecliptic, merging in primordial chaos, forming a sphere of primal yellow. The sun’s *hun* enters the moon’s *po*, and the moon’s *po* receives it to form an embryo. When the sun’s light and moon’s essence unite in due time, matching their tally, the original luminous body suffers no loss. Hence it is said, “The moon receives the sun’s transformation, and its body suffers no harm.” This is the constant Dao of the sun and moon’s mutual influence.

The Dao of elixir cultivation follows the same principle. Within our bodies, the sun’s light and moon’s essence reflect upon one another moment by moment. When the sun and moon conjoin as a single disk, they give birth to the toad’s radiance, which becomes the root of the golden elixir. If yang loses its tally, yin encroaches upon its brightness; at the dark and new moons, eclipses occur, with obscuration and overpowering in mutual contention. Yang’s form is consumed, and yin’s calamities arise. This passage speaks of the loss of constancy in their mutual influence, akin to the earlier statement: *“When water waxes, it encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, daylight dims.”*

At the conjunction of the dark and new moons, the sun and moon merge. If the yang *hun* can restrain the yin *po*, though it dwells within yin’s body, its luminous essence remains intact. But if the yang light cannot take command, sinking into the Northern Sea with no means of self-emergence, it loses the tally of their union, inevitably suffering encroachment by yin and the loss of its brightness. Thus it is said: *“If yang loses its tally, yin encroaches upon its brightness.”* Once yang is encroached upon by yin, it leads to the calamity of eclipses.

At the time of the dark and new moons, a single yang essence sinks into the depths of the cavernous void. With the fire’s power still weak and the water’s force waxing, yin prevails and obscures yang, while the surging water overwhelms fire, contending and seizing in mutual struggle. The great yang, which should shine at midday, becomes dim. Thus it is said: *“At the dark and new moons, eclipses occur, with obscuration and overpowering in mutual contention.”* The light of the great yang, born of metal’s nature, is originally round, bright, and universally illuminating, never diminishing. Yet once it suffers encroachment by yin qi, its form temporarily fades, and the calamity of eclipses arises. Thus it is said: *“Yang’s form is consumed, and yin’s calamities arise.”* This describes how the loss of the Dao in the sun and moon’s mutual influence immediately summons disaster. In human cultivation, this corresponds to the initial union of *kan* and *li*, when a single yang sinks to the sea’s depths. If, in movement and stillness, the slightest misstep occurs, the true fire becomes trapped in water, unable to emerge from the furnace, manifesting the phenomenon of eclipses. (See Chapter Fifteen of the preceding section for details.)

Male and female depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling to nurture growth. Yin and yang intermingle, seeking their kind. Metal transforms into water, and water’s nature flows unrestrained; fire transforms into earth, and water cannot course freely. The male moves and extends outward, while the female remains still and stores within. If the measure is exceeded, it is constrained by the female. The *po* restrains the *hun*, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in due time, each attains harmony, and both emit their tally’s proof. This passage speaks of the Dao achieved in their mutual influence, akin to the earlier statement: *“Yin and yang consume one another, and their mutual influence follows the natural Dao.”*

The *kan* male and *li* female depend on one another for function. The moon’s *po* draws in the golden crow’s essence from without; the sun’s *hun* exhales the jade rabbit’s marrow from within. Inverting host and guest, one inhales and one exhales, and the true seed thus flourishes. Thus it is said: *“Male and female depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling to nurture growth.”* *Qian* is originally old yang, yet transforms into the primordial maiden within *li*; *kun* is originally old yin, yet transforms into the yellow male within *kan*. Though *qian* and *kun* shatter their bodies, exhibiting the intermingling of yin and yang, the true fire within *kan* still seeks to ascend and return to *qian*, while the true water within *li* still seeks to descend and return to *kun*. Only through refining the shattered body into a pure one is this achieved—this is the principle of *“water flows to the damp, fire tends toward the dry,”* each following its kind. Thus it is said: *“Yin and yang intermingle, seeking their kind.”* Within our bodies, this is the work of *wu* flowing to *ji*, where like attracts like.

*Li* is originally the great yang of *qian* metal, but when a single yin emerges within it, the yang metal transforms into yin water—this is the so-called *“pearl flowing from the great yang.”* Its nature is to flow and wander, uncontrolled, inevitably flooding and circulating without restraint. Thus it is said: *“Metal transforms into water, and water’s nature flows unrestrained.”* Once the water within *li* floods, it comes to restrain the true fire within *kan*. Fortunately, the true fire within *kan* transforms into *wu* earth, which in turn can control water—this is the so-called *“yellow sprout as root.”* The *wu* earth within *kan* and the *ji* earth within *li* unite and settle in the central palace, so that the circulating water finds its embankment and dares not recklessly flow in all directions. Thus it is said: *“Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot course freely.”*

The moon’s essence of *kan wu* is originally dark and stored within, yet its great yang true fire inherits the nature of the *qian* father. Fire’s nature is to move, and movement should extend outward in function. Thus it is said: *“The male moves and extends outward.”* The sun’s light of *li ji* is originally ethereal and functions externally, yet its great yin true water inherits the nature of the *kun* mother. Water’s nature is to be still, and stillness should withdraw and conceal within. Thus it is said: *“The female remains still and stores within.”* This is the marvelous inversion and reversal of the earlier statement: *“The sun extends its virtue, and the moon unfurls its light.”*

Yet when the two unite, movement and stillness must each follow their measure. If yang moves to join yin and becomes excessively immersed, entering but unable to emerge, the great yang true fire suffers encroachment by the flooding water qi. This is like the union of male and female: if desire is excessive, the man becomes constrained by the woman. Thus it is said: *“If the measure is exceeded, it is constrained by the female.”* This is the verification of the earlier statement: *“If yang loses its tally, yin encroaches upon its brightness,”* and the omen of eclipses.

The yin within *li* belongs to the *po*, yet because it is the body of the great yang, it is instead called the yang spirit, the sun’s *hun*. The yang within *kan* belongs to the *hun*, yet because it is the essence of the great yin, it is instead called the yin spirit, the moon’s *po*—this is the so-called *“hun and po serve as each other’s dwellings.”* Now, with fire transforming into earth to restrain the unrestrained water, the *po* can control the *hun* and prevent excess. Thus it is said: *“The po restrains the hun, preventing excess.”* With *hun* and *po* mutually restraining, water and fire in balance, when a single yang moves to advance fire and retreat water, it does not err toward excessive cold.

When a single yin settles and advances water, retreating fire does not err toward excessive heat. Thus it is said: *“Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in due season.”* When water flourishes yet does not exceed in cold, and fire flourishes yet does not exceed in heat, their qi harmonizes in equilibrium, forever free from the calamity of eclipses and obscurations. Thereupon, the sun’s radiance and the moon’s essence merge and converge, reaching the region of *geng*. The metal’s essence emits its light, and as the single yang receives the tally, the great elixir of golden cinnabar is produced. Thus it is said: *“Each attains its harmony, both emit the tally of verification.”* *Verification* means confirmation; *tally* means correspondence—rightly answering the sense of *“tally”* in the preceding text.

This chapter speaks of refining and tempering the *hun* and *po*, harmonizing water and fire, and the subtleties of inversion and reversal—these are the operations of the golden elixir at the crucible. It should be read in conjunction with Chapters Eleven and Fifteen of the preceding section.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Three Families Meet**

Cinnabar and wood-essence merge when they obtain metal; where metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions. These four, in primordial chaos, are arrayed as dragon and tiger. The dragon, born of the odd number of yang, is yang; the tiger, born of the even number of yin, is yin.

The liver, blue-green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother. *Li*, red, is the daughter; the kidneys, black, are the son—the son is the beginning of the Five Phases. The spleen, yellow, is the ancestor. The three substances form one family, all returning to *wu* and *ji*.
*(The line “the son is the beginning of the Five Phases” was misplaced below “the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor” in common editions; it has now been corrected according to ancient texts.)*

This chapter speaks of the three families of body, heart, and intent uniting as one to form the elixir. Man is the heart of Heaven and Earth, thus able to establish the Three Powers and partake of Heaven and Earth. At the moment of receiving qi at birth, the primordial ancestral qi first enters the Central Palace, whole and undivided, in the chaos of the Great Ultimate—this is what is called the heart of Heaven and Earth. After the first cry, the Great Ultimate divides from the womb: above, the Celestial Pass is established, concealing the *qian* nature; below, the Earthly Axis is established, concealing the *kun* destiny. The empty valley lies between Heaven and Earth, concealing the original spirit. From the One Center, creation divides, and the Three Powers are thus fixed. Once the Three Powers are established, the Four Images immediately separate.

For *qian* is the ancestral nature of the prior Heaven, which breaks open to become *li* and transforms into the heart of the posterior Heaven. *Kun* is the original destiny of the prior Heaven, which solidifies to become *kan* and transforms into the body of the posterior Heaven. As for the prior Heaven’s *li*, it further transforms into *zhen*, with wood within fire—this is the image of the *hun* lodging in the heart. The prior Heaven’s *kan* further transforms into *dui*, with metal within water—this is the image of the *po* concealed in the body. From the One Qi, two bodies divide; from the two bodies, the Four Images further divide.

Once the Four Images are established, wood and fire of the east and south dwell together in the yang region, while water and metal of the west and north reside jointly in the yin position. The southern *li* fire, red in color, bears the image of cinnabar, within which true mercury is concealed—this is the wood-essence. It is like the northern *kan* water, where black lead conceals the metal-essence. People know only that fire contains wood, yet fail to recognize that wood contains metal. For wood flourishes in *mao*, and the qi of metal is already gestating within *mao*. The yang *hun* must obtain the yin *po* before its spirit has a place to return—metal does not depart from wood.

People know only that water contains metal, yet fail to recognize that metal contains wood. For metal flourishes in *you*, and the qi of wood is already gestating within *you*. The yin *po* cannot obtain the yang *hun*, so where would its spirit attach? Wood does not depart from metal. Though metal and wood are divided between the two arcs, *hun* and *po* are truly merged as one body. Thus it is said: *“Cinnabar and wood-essence merge when they obtain metal.”*

Heaven’s One generates water, whose image is the Dark Warrior; in man, it pertains to the essence within the kidneys, manifesting through the ears. Earth’s Four generates metal, whose image is the White Tiger; in man, it pertains to the *po* within the lungs, manifesting through the nose. Essence and *po* are both tied to the body, hence: *“where metal and water unite.”*

Earth’s Two generates fire, whose image is the Vermilion Bird; in man, it pertains to the spirit within the heart, manifesting through the tongue. Heaven’s Three generates wood, whose image is the Azure Dragon; in man, it pertains to the *hun* within the liver, manifesting through the eyes. *Hun* and spirit are both tied to the heart, hence: *“wood and fire become companions.”*

In ordinary people, the heart is merely the heart, and the body merely the body—water and fire do not interact, metal and wood remain separate, and so they drift ever farther from the Dao. Those who study the Dao, if they can in every double-hour contain their gaze, concentrate their hearing, regulate their breath, seal their tongue, and still the Four Great, causing spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* to gather in the Central Palace, and water, fire, wood, and metal to merge along the Yellow Path—this is the image of *“the four in primordial chaos.”* Within this chaos, one must be able to merge the Four Images into one body, and also to divide the one body into Four Images.

Originally, wood and fire were companions, and from *li* the wood-fluid is born—this is the dragon emerging from fire. Originally, metal and water were united, and from *kan* the metal-essence is produced—this is the tiger arising from water. Thus appears the image of *“arrayed as dragon and tiger.”* As Zhang Pingshu said: *“The Four Images do not depart from the two bodies.”*

The dragon is born of Heaven’s Three, wood—is its number not odd? Odd pertains to yang, hence it is called the yang dragon. The tiger is born of Earth’s Four, metal—is its number not even? Even pertains to yin, hence it is called the yin tiger. This speaks of the original bodies of dragon and tiger. If the Five Phases are inverted, then the dragon becomes yin, and the tiger becomes yang.

The Five Phases of the elixir path are not tied to the five viscera. Master Wei, fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, spoke of the mother while concealing the child, and provisionally assigned the Five Phases to the five viscera within the body. In the common Five Phases, wood can generate fire, and metal can generate water—what generates is called father and mother, hence the image of *“the liver, blue-green, as father; the lungs, white, as mother.”*

Wood’s three and metal’s four—one yin, one yang. What they generate are called sons and daughters, hence the image of *“Li’s red as daughter, the kidneys’ black as son.”* Water’s one and fire’s two—likewise one yin, one yang. Why then is it said, *“The child is the beginning of the Five Phases”*? It is because Heaven’s one generates water, receiving it first of all. Heaven opens at *zi*, thus occupying the due-north position of *zi*, and is truly the source of the Five Phases. Thereafter wood, fire, earth, and metal are generated in sequence. Hence it is said, *“The child is the beginning of the Five Phases.”* The *qi* of the ancestral origin is concealed within Kun earth, from which metal, wood, water, and fire all emerge, hence the image of *“the spleen’s yellow as ancestor.”* Since water is the source of the Five Phases, it takes the meaning of beginning, which is also the ancestral aperture within our body. Earth is the mother of the Five Phases, thus it takes the image of ancestor, which is the center of our body’s ancestral aperture. The myriad transformations return to the One, and the One in turn returns to the Center—here one may awaken to the work of returning to the root and restoring life.

The *hun* of liver-wood and the *shen* of heart-fire both issue from the heart within *Li*, forming the true emptiness within the wondrous existence of the original state—these are one thing, the so-called *“east’s three and south’s two together make five.”* The *po* of lung-metal and the *jing* of kidney-water both issue from the body within *Kan*, forming the wondrous existence within the true emptiness of the original state—these are one thing, the so-called *“north’s one and west’s four share it.”* Within *Kan* lies *wu*, within *Li* lies *ji*; together they form the central earth, solitary and without counterpart—this is true intent. True intent is the original *qi* of the primordial *qian*, and is yet another thing, the so-called *“wu and ji return from the generative number five.”*

The households of body and mind are by nature difficult to unite; fortunately, true intent acts as the go-between, blending north and south, merging east and west, meeting in the yellow-earth crucible of the Center to congeal a single grain of golden elixir—the so-called *“the three families meet to form the infant.”* When the three things gather, they return to the One, and the One in turn returns to the Center—this is the Dao of returning to the root, restoring life, and reverting to the origin. Thus it is summarized: *“The three things are one family, all returning to wu and ji.”*

The postnatal body and mind are none other than the prenatal nature and life—this is the image of the Two Modes. The postnatal body, mind, and intent are none other than the prenatal original essence, original *qi*, and original spirit—this is the image of the Three Powers. The postnatal true earth is none other than the prenatal ancestral earth of *Fuli*—this is the image of the Supreme Ultimate. When the three things return to one family, it is the image of the Supreme Ultimate containing the Three as One. Has one not attained the embodiment of the Dao at this point? Standing between heaven and earth, one is utterly at one with the heart of heaven and earth. If one can take yet another step at the hundred-foot pole and thoroughly realize the original face before the birth of the body, one will know that though heaven and earth may decay, this does not decay; though emptiness may end, this is endless. Alas! Who can truly know this?

The author of this chapter has already slightly revealed the celestial mechanism; the commentator has fully opened a new perspective. May the reader possess a discerning eye and take care not to enter the mountain of treasure only to return empty-handed.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Reversal of Punishment and Virtue**

Hard and soft alternate in succession, traversing the divisions of the phases. The dragon in the west and the tiger in the east establish the weft of *mao* and *you*. Punishment and virtue meet in joyful union: punishment governs restraint and killing, while virtue governs generation and arising. In the second month, the elm scatters its flowers as the *Kui* star arrives at *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian’gang* star occupies *you*. *Zi* in the south and *wu* in the north serve as mutual guiding principles. The numbers one and nine end and begin anew. Within *Xu* and *Wei*, essence is sown at *zi*.

This chapter speaks of the profound mystery of the dragon and tiger’s two phases and the mutual employment of punishment and virtue. In the elixir path, water and fire are the essence, while metal and wood are the function. *Zi* and *wu* fix the north-south meridian, *mao* and *you* move the east-west weft. Interweaving and interlocking, they correspond to the degrees of the celestial sphere. In terms of the constant Dao of creation, the heavenly Dao has one yin and one yang, the earthly Dao has one soft and one hard. Once the Two Modes are established, they intermingle to form the Four Images: *zi*-water resides in the north, *wu*-fire in the south, *mao*-wood in the east, and *you*-metal in the west. From *zi* to *si* is yang-hardness, moving through the southeast; from *wu* to *hai* is yin-softness, moving through the northwest. Divided into the twelve branches and further into the twenty-eight constellations, the 365 degrees of the celestial sphere each have their fixed positions. Only when the handle of the Dipper shifts in the center of heaven does *zi* rotate to the right, *wu* revolve to the east, hardness reverse to softness, and softness reverse to hardness—all fixed positions become unfixed at this point. Hence it is said, *“Hard and soft alternate in succession, traversing the divisions of the phases.”*

*Zhen*-wood is the dragon, originally dwelling in the east at the *mao* position; *Dui*-metal is the tiger, originally dwelling in the west at the *you* position. Yet when traversing the divisions of the phases, the dragon reverses to *you*, and the tiger reverses to *mao*. East and west form the weft of south and north, hence it is said, *“The dragon in the west and the tiger in the east establish the weft of mao and you.”*

The dragon bears the generative *qi* of the east, an image of virtue; yet when the dragon turns to the west, the *qi* of wood transforms to follow metal, and virtue reverses to punishment. The tiger bears the killing *qi* of the west, an image of punishment; yet when the tiger turns to the east, the *qi* of metal transforms to follow wood, and punishment reverses to virtue. The intermingling of metal and wood occurs in a single moment. If one understands the mechanism of reversal, then harm naturally gives rise to grace, and host and guest meet in joyful union. Hence it is said, *“Punishment and virtue meet in joyful union.”*

People only know that punishment governs killing, yet do not realize that the mechanism of killing is precisely concealed within the mechanism of generation. People only know that virtue governs generation, yet do not realize that the mechanism of generation is precisely hidden within the mechanism of killing. Hence it is said, *“Punishment governs restraint and killing, while virtue governs generation and arising.”*

At the time of the second month, when *mao*-Wood flourishes in full vigor, myriad plants burst into bloom—why then do the elm’s pods suddenly fall? This is because *mao* forms a union with *xu*, and *xu* is about to become the *River Chariot* of the west; the *River Chariot* now occupies the *mao* position, bearing generation within killing, thus manifesting the response of the elm’s pods. This is precisely the image of the killing mechanism lying concealed, where virtue reverses to punishment.

At the time of the eighth month, when *you*-Metal reigns in full strength, a hundred grasses wither—why then do shepherd’s purse and wheat suddenly sprout? This is because *chen* forms a union with *you*, and *chen* is about to become the *Celestial Pivot* of the east; it now holds the *you* position, bearing killing within generation, thus manifesting the image of wheat’s sprouting. This is precisely the image of the generative mechanism hidden within, where punishment reverses to virtue.

Once one thoroughly comprehends the mechanism of creation and transformation, one immediately understands the creation and transformation within one’s own body. Those who cultivate the Dao, at the time when the two crescents merge as one, must revolve the *Celestial Pivot* in reverse, rotate the handle of the *River Chariot* against its course, externally guard the six gates, and internally seal the cinnabar latch.

The cinnabar latch sealed, one washes the heart and bathes in purity—all in but a moment—naturally reversing punishment into virtue, killing into generation, merging the natures and dispositions of the two things into one.

East at *mao*, west at *you*; south at *wu*, north at *zi*—these are the warp and woof of the celestial sphere. In the cinnabar Way, the handle of the Dipper is rotated in reverse, so that the east-west weft, already contrary to the norm, forces the north-south warp likewise to exchange places. How is this known?

Yang is born at *zi*, thus the fire embryo resides in *zi*; yet the true fire of great yang within *kan* originally emerges from the south. Now, with *zi* turning right, it returns to the south. Yin is born at *wu*, thus the water embryo resides in *wu*; yet the true water of great yin within *li* originally comes from the north. Now, with *wu* rotating east, it returns to the north. One water, one fire—presence and absence intermingle. Though called mutual assistance, this is in truth a reversal of their origins.

With north and south exchanged, every celestial pattern and image in the heavens follows in inversion. Hence it is said: “*Zi* south, *wu* north, mutually serving as warp and woof.” The post-heaven Five Phases are employed in reverse, entirely based on the *Luoshu*. The numbers of the *Luoshu* begin at one and end at nine: the north’s *kan* position holds one, while *qian* in the northwest truly initiates the sequence, so the one yang of *qian* lodges within *kan*, and the one of *kan* is the beginning of *qian*. The south’s *li* position holds nine, while *kun* in the southwest truly concludes the sequence, so the one yin of *kun* lodges within *li*, and the nine of *li* is the end of *kun*. Now, with *zi* south and *wu* north, their positions exchanged, *kan* becomes the end and transforms into *kun*; *li* becomes the beginning and transforms into *qian*. One becomes nine, nine reverts to one—endless circulation. In the *Yi*, this is the image of *qian*’s primal yang employing nine, the host of dragons without a head; in the cinnabar Way, it is the work of nine revolutions. Hence it is said: “The numbers of one and nine end and begin anew.”

Heaven’s one generates water; the north’s *kan* position precisely aligns with the degrees of *Xu* and *Wei*, the root-source of creation and transformation. The two constellations *Xu* and *Wei* in the heavens lie between *hai* and *zi*, the place where sun and moon unite as one; in the human body, they correspond to the junction of *Ren* and *Du*, where water and fire simultaneously arise. *Xu* belongs to the sun, *Wei* to the moon—here true water and true fire mutually conceal their essence. As Bai Ziqing said: “Creation is soundless; fire arises within water—its wonder lies in the *Xu-Wei* cavity.” If the scholar of the Way can attain emptiness and guard stillness, return the light of the south’s *li* to illuminate the north’s *kan* earth, so that the primal essence within *li* and the primal *qi* within *kan* naturally nurture one another, then, upon reaching the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, heaven and human respond in unison. A single speck of true yang is born in the Northern Sea, and can be gathered as the foundation of the great elixir. Hence it is said: “Embracing the primal in *Xu-Wei*, sowing essence in *zi*.” This speaks of water and fire achieving harmony to produce the great medicine—it is the same work as the earlier merging of metal and wood.

For *zi* south and *wu* north mutually serve as warp and woof—this is the body of sun and moon. The dragon in the west and tiger in the east establish the weft at *mao* and *you*—this is the function of the two crescents. Yet the marvel of their merging lies entirely in the mechanism of mutually concealing generation and killing. It depends solely on the momentary reversal of bathing, instantly perfecting the work of harmonizing the four images. This should be studied in conjunction with the chapter on the three families meeting.

**Chapter Thirty: The Mutual Resonance of Yin and Yang**

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the islet in the river.
Gentle and graceful is the maiden,
a fine mate for the noble man.

The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not live in solitude.
Black Warrior of turtle and snake,
coiled dragons supporting one another—
thus are yin and yang made clear,
each naturally requiring the other.

Were two women to share a chamber,
their beauty most fair,
with Su Qin speaking persuasively,
Zhang Yi arranging the match,
their tongues sharp as braids,
eloquent in fine words,
opening their hearts in harmony,
vowing to be husband and wife—
even with hair worn out and teeth decayed,
they would never truly know one another.

If the medicinal substances are not of the same kind,
their names and categories different,
their proportions uneven,
their warp and woof lost—
though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace,
Taiyi hold the fire,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
pavilions raised and altars erected,
steps and terraces of jade,
unicorn jerky and phoenix preserved meat offered,
registers held and long kneeling performed,
prayers and sacrifices to spirits,
pleas to the ghosts,
bathing and fasting observed,
vain hopes entertained—
it would be like mending a cauldron with glue,
applying brine to a wound,
adding ice to dispel cold,
using hot water to remove heat,
making turtles fly and snakes dance—
only to see things grow more perverse.

This chapter speaks of true yin and true yang, of like kind resonating with like, to accomplish the great Way of the golden elixir.

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the islet in the river.
Gentle and graceful is the maiden,
a fine mate for the noble man.

The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not live in solitude.
Black Warrior of turtle and snake,
coiled dragons supporting one another—
thus are yin and yang made clear,
each naturally requiring the other.

This passage speaks of the mutual resonance of yin and yang, each according to its kind.

“One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao,” as Confucius wrote in the *Appended Judgments*. “Partial yin, partial yang—this is called illness,” as Qibo wrote in the *Plain Questions*. For all the sages and teachers of old employed substances of true yin and true yang, of the same kind, to transcend the ordinary and enter sainthood. Thus the *Yi* begins with *qian* and *kun*, clarifying the unchanging body of yin and yang; the *Book of Songs* begins with the “Guan Ju,” illustrating the interchangeable function of yin and yang. Even in worldly matters: the osprey’s paired mating and the ode to a fine mate, the resonance of one female and one male; the turtle and snake, coiled dragons forming the Black Warrior, the mutual requirement of one yin and one yang. The turtle and snake pairing with the north’s Black Warrior is indeed the image of *kan*; the osprey pairing with the south’s Vermilion Bird is certainly the image of *li*. The union of heaven’s primal and earth’s receptive in our bodies, the coupling of *kan*’s man and *li*’s woman—how is this different? If one thoroughly understands the laws of the worldly realm, one immediately knows the laws beyond the world.

Should two women share a chamber, their beauty most fair, with Su Qin offering persuasive words and Zhang Yi brokering the match—flaunting eloquent tongues and weaving honeyed speech, baring their hearts to harmonize, vowing to wed as husband and wife—yet even with hair worn thin and teeth decayed, they would never truly know one another. This passage illustrates the folly of cultivating but a single element, for it is not the Dao.

In the Dao of the *Yi*, Kun pairs with Qian, Li with Kan, Xun with Zhen, Dui with Gen—each a union of one yin and one yang, each finding its counterpart, only then achieving the work of mutual resonance. Yet when fire ascends and marsh descends, Dui meets Li, two yins following one another, this is called the *Kui* hexagram. The Master’s commentary on it says: “Two women dwelling together, their wills do not move as one.” Thus, two women sharing a chamber, yin seeking yin—even if they deploy the tongues of Su and Zhang to broker a marriage—will never achieve lifelong harmony. This is what is meant by “cultivating but a single element,” an orphaned yin.

If the ingredients are not of the same kind, their categories disparate, their proportions misaligned, their guiding principles lost—even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, Tai Yi wields the flame, the Eight Lords pound and refine, Huainan harmonizes the blend; even if they erect towering altars with jade steps, offer unicorn jerky and phoenix cured meats, prostrate themselves with registers in hand, pray to the spirits, beseech the ghosts, bathe in purity and fast in reverence, harboring vain hopes—it would be like mending a cauldron with glue, salving a wound with brine, adding ice to dispel cold, or using hot water to quench heat. To demand a tortoise fly or a snake dance would only make their perversity more glaring. This passage makes clear that disparate substances cannot fuse to form the elixir.

What, then, are the same kind? The life-stem within Li, the nature-root within Kan—only when one yin and one yang unite do true lead and true mercury emerge. Yet people fail to realize that true lead and true mercury arise in the primordial, possessing no form or substance. Instead, they seek the dregs of the posterior heaven: the Three Yellows, Four Spirits, Five Metals, Eight Stones—nothing they do not try. This is what is meant by “ingredients not of the same kind, their categories disparate.” Even if they recognize the ingredients, they do not know the methods of gathering, refining, and firing—this is what is meant by “proportions misaligned, guiding principles lost.”

Such benighted fools, refusing to seek a true teacher’s guidance, remain ignorant of the great Way of ingestion and refinement. They vainly believe that the false arts of the furnace and flame might by chance produce the elixir. Year after year, they toil in vain, squandering their wealth, even erecting altars to sacrifice to ghosts and pray to spirits, hoping for aid from the unseen. Yet even if divine sages were to tend the furnace for them, immortals to pound and refine on their behalf, every attempt would end in failure. Those external alchemical arts, their ingredients not of the true seed, their combinations not of the same kind, are like mending a cauldron with glue or salving a wound with brine—utterly dissimilar. Moreover, everyone knows that nothing is colder than ice, hotter than boiling water, that tortoises cannot fly, nor snakes dance. Yet to dispel cold by adding ice, to quench heat with hot water, to seize a tortoise and demand it fly, or a snake and force it to dance—how much more do such actions violate the mutual containment of water and fire, the restraining dynamic of tortoise and snake? Their perversity and contrariness defy description. How is the error of using the wrong seed any different?

The great Dao does not depart from yin and yang; yin and yang are nothing but nature and life. These two emerge as one yet bear different names, fundamentally the same path. In the *Yi* of Fuxi, they are one Kan and one Li; in the scripture of Laozi, they are one Nonbeing and one Being. At the root, a single phrase suffices to clarify. Yet later alchemical texts and philosophical works, with their myriad roundabout metaphors, have only opened the floodgates to confusion, leading many astray into heterodox paths.

The Dao of the elixir sometimes compares the process to man and woman, for Qian’s Dao gives rise to man, Kun’s Dao to woman—these are the numinous father and sagely mother within oneself, not the men and women of the mundane world. At other times, it compares them to lead and mercury, for the primordial essence within Li and the primordial qi within Kan are one’s true lead and true mercury, not the lead and mercury of the material world. Alas, the world is filled with those greedy for wealth and lustful for beauty, who either fall for the delusions of “gathering and supplementing” or the deceptions of “burning and refining.” Compounding the problem, the charlatans they encounter fabricate ever more bizarre claims, falsely citing alchemical texts to deceive the unlearned.

Those deluded by “gathering and supplementing” commit errors too numerous to list, but in essence, they mistake men and women for yin and yang, indulging their lustful desires. Those deluded by “burning and refining” stray in countless ways, but in essence, they mistake cinnabar and mercury for the ingredients, indulging their greed for wealth. Such heretical arts slander the great Dao of the ancient sages and sever the true cultivation of later worthies. Though they claim to study the Dao, they are in fact creating karma—undoubtedly planting the seeds of hell.

There are also those who grasp the principles somewhat more clearly and harbor slightly purer intentions. Fortunate to avoid the two perverse paths, they turn their search inward to body and mind. Yet they do not realize that the body is not the body of the Four Great Elements, but wondrous existence within true emptiness; the mind is not the mind of the fleshly mass, but true emptiness within wondrous existence. Body and mind are one, seamlessly merged—provisionally called the elixir. Alas, without encountering a true teacher, seekers remain blind to the great Dao. They inevitably mistake the illusory combination of the Four Great Elements for the body, the fleeting shadow of the fleshly mass for the mind.

Those attached to the illusory body often fixate on guarding essence and circulating qi, leaning toward contrived effort. Their error lies in seeking the body outside the mind, unaware that true emptiness *is* the body—and even the body they guard is not the true one. Those attached to the phantom mind often cling to seated meditation and entering samadhi, leaning toward non-action. Their error lies in seeking the mind outside the body, unaware that wondrous existence *is* the mind—and even the mind they grasp is false.

Yet they fail to realize: cultivating life without awakening to nature leaves one a fool whose lifespan matches heaven and earth; awakening to nature without cultivating life dooms the eternal yin spirit to struggle endlessly toward sagehood. How much less, then, can the illusory body and phantom mind—along with whatever single thing they cling to—be considered real?

Generally, each school clings to its own doctrine, failing to harmonize with others, all suffering from the illness of partial yin or partial yang, not the great Dao of balanced yin and yang. Master Wei composed the *Cantong Qi*, exhaustively exploring the nature and emotions of the *Great Change*, borrowing the imagery of furnace and fire, and sealing the宗旨 of the Huang-Lao tradition. It reveals nothing but two entities of shared origin yet differing names, enabling all beings on earth to fulfill their nature and realize their life-destiny, directly transcending to the other shore.

Yet one must guard against heterodox arts disrupting the true path, and carefully distinguish them; one must correct the deviations of the Hīnayāna, which loses the truth. Though I have earnestly expounded this in the final chapter on nurturing nature, I fear the world remains unenlightened. Thus, I reclarify the true seed here, shattering all devious bypaths, so that learners of the Dao across the ages may abandon the false and return to the true, discard illusion and attain reality—thereby matching the功用 of the Three Sages who unfolded the *Yi*, Huang-Lao, and scriptures.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Success of Reclusive Ingestion**

Of old, the sagely and worthy, embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the real, refined the Nine Cauldrons in reclusion, concealing their traces and vanishing from the world. They contained essence and nurtured spirit, aligning their virtue with the Three Luminaries. Essence overflowed into the pores, sinews and bones grew firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, the upright *qi* ever abided. Through long accumulation, they transformed their form and became immortals.

Moved by compassion for later generations—those who love the Dao—they gathered scattered teachings, traced ancient texts, and composed diagrams and books to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches, concealing the root; they assigned various names and obscured the true meaning of texts. Scholars who obtained these works stored them in cabinets for lifetimes. Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons followed their ancestors’ paths, passing down confusion through generations, never gaining insight. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and aspirants fell into poverty.

Deeply grieved, I have definitively recorded this text—concise in words and easy to ponder, sparing in affairs and free from tedium. I lay out its principles, verifying them for observation; their measures are precise, allowing for mutual progression. Thus, I employ disordered phrases to open its gates; the wise will reflect carefully and deliberate upon them.

Diligently practice this, day and night without rest. After three years of reclusive ingestion, you will ascend lightly and wander afar, unscathed by fire, undampened by water. You will master presence and absence, ever joyful and free from care. When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, you will conceal yourself and await the time. The Supreme Unity will summon you, relocating you to the Central Land. When your merit is complete, you will ascend, receiving the register and talismans.

*(The fourteen lines beginning with "Diligently practice this" were mistakenly included in the previous chapter, "Discerning the False and Upholding the True," in common editions; I have now corrected this.)*

This chapter comprehensively presents the success of reclusive ingestion, serving as the summation of the middle section of the *Cantong Qi*.

Of old, the sagely and worthy, embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the real, refined the Nine Cauldrons in reclusion, concealing their traces and vanishing from the world. They contained essence and nurtured spirit, aligning their virtue with the Three Luminaries. Essence overflowed into the pores, bones and sinews grew firm; all perverse influences were dispelled, the upright *qi* ever abided. Through long accumulation, they transformed their form and became immortals.

This speaks of how the ancient sages attained the great Dao through reclusive ingestion. "Of old, the sagely and worthy" refers to the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and all the transcendent ones who ascended in antiquity. "Embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the real" denotes the work of guarding the center and embracing the One, returning to the root and restoring life—this is the task of nurturing nature. Yet nurturing nature cannot proceed without the effort of reclusive refinement. In the Dao of the elixir, nine transformations complete the work, hence "refining the Nine Cauldrons." "Concealing their traces and vanishing from the world" refers to examples like the Yellow Emperor, whose elixir was perfected and who ascended at Mount Dinghu, or Laozi, who departed through the pass and manifested transformations in the West.

The original essence, *qi*, and spirit of humans correspond to the sun, moon, and Northern Dipper in the heavens. When these three are complete, they harmonize their virtue with the Three Luminaries. Thus it is said: "They contained essence and nurtured spirit, aligning their virtue with the Three Luminaries." The Yellow Center penetrates the principles, moistening and reaching the skin—hence "Essence overflowed into the pores, sinews and bones grew firm," describing the marvel of the form. Preserving the Great Harmony, nature and life each find their proper place—hence "All perverse influences were dispelled, the upright *qi* ever abided," describing the marvel of the spirit. After nine years of wall-facing, when practice is complete and merit fulfilled, one suddenly transcends the realm of form and *qi*, becoming a true person. Thus it is said: "Through long accumulation, they transformed their form and became immortals"—this is the state of both form and spirit being marvelous, merging with the Dao in reality.

Moved by compassion for later generations—those who love the Dao—they gathered scattered teachings, traced ancient texts, and composed diagrams and books to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches, concealing the root; they assigned various names and obscured the true meaning of texts. Scholars who obtained these works stored them in cabinets for lifetimes. Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons followed their ancestors’ paths, passing down confusion through generations, never gaining insight. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and aspirants fell into poverty.

This passage describes how the ancient sages composed books to awaken the world, yet later generations lost their intent. The ancient sages possessed vast and magnanimous hearts, refusing to be mere self-liberated individuals. Having attained liberation themselves, they inevitably sought to liberate others. Compelled by circumstance, they wrote books and established teachings—such as the Yellow Emperor’s *Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman*, Laozi’s *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*, and all the alchemical classics and texts transmitted by the various transcendents. All were composed out of compassion for later generations of Dao-seekers who could not find the gate to enter. They specifically pointed out the root of nature and life, providing various supports and tracing them into diagrams and books to guide posterity and lead them through the gate.

Yet fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, they spoke of the mother without revealing the child, exposing the branches while hiding the root. Terms like the Three Thieves and Five Bandits, the Mysterious Female, the Bellows and Key, as well as Dragon and Tiger, Yellow Sprout, Golden Flower, and myriad other names—these are what is meant by "assigning various names and obscuring the true meaning of texts." Their true intention was for later scholars to repeatedly investigate and ponder, grasping the meaning while forgetting the images.

Alas, among learners, the deluded are many while the enlightened are few. They refuse to humbly seek a master’s true instruction, like bright pearls and great cowries locked deep in a chest, never to see the light—condemned to lifelong poverty, passing ignorance from father to son, from ancestor to descendant, age after age in delusion’s endless cycle, ever more lost, ever more confused, with no hope of awakening. Not recognizing the treasures of their own house, when will their poverty ever end? It is like an official who never serves, a farmer who abandons the plow, a merchant who discards his goods—thus the determined scholar suffers endless hardship at home. This is the parable of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*: a jewel sewn into one’s robe, unknown to its wearer, who begs for alms elsewhere.

Yet this is not the fault of the ancient sages. In writing their books to awaken the world, they wished for all to attain enlightenment—how could they have foreseen such delusion? As the saying goes: “The rivers and lakes bear no ill will toward people; it is people who cannot cross them and so blame the rivers and lakes. The patriarchs never deceived anyone; it is people who cannot penetrate the teachings and so resent the patriarchs for deceiving them.” If one wishes not to be deceived, one must seek a great guiding master.

I grieve deeply for this and have therefore recorded this text—its words concise and easy to ponder, its matters streamlined and unburdensome. Its principles are laid out in order, verifiable and observable, their measures precise and interlinked. Thus, I have employed disordered phrases to obscure, yet left openings in the gate. Let the wise reflect carefully and contemplate its intent.

This passage expresses my intent in transmitting the ancient sages’ writings to awaken the world. Later learners fail to grasp the great Dao of the ancient sages simply because they cannot find the gate to enter. The Immortal Elder, moved by compassion for later learners, composed the *Cantong Qi* (*The Seal of the Unity of the Three*), expanding upon the images of Qian and Kun, Kan and Li from the *Book of Changes*, borrowing the alchemical terms of Dragon and Tiger, Lead and Mercury, and returning to the essence of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teaching on fulfilling one’s nature and perfecting life. Its language is simple and essential, hence its words are concise and easy to ponder; its purport is unified, hence its matters are streamlined and uncluttered. “Laying out its principles in order” means dividing the one Dao into three schools, thus revealing the branches. “Verifiable and observable” means the three schools originally stem from one Dao, thus concealing the root. Yet the artistry of its composition lies in revealing without fully revealing, concealing without fully concealing—each measure and weight precisely balanced, all drawn from the ancient sages’ texts and refined through careful consideration, making it easier for learners to explore.

If too much is revealed, the celestial mechanism may be leaked; thus, disordered phrases must be used. If too much is concealed, the celestial Dao may be obstructed; thus, openings in the gate must be left. Should there be a person of discerning eyes in the world who, through repeated study of these three chapters, penetrates to the openings within, they will realize that the great Dao lies hidden in the chest before their eyes—possessed by all, with no one rich or poor.

The Immortal Elder’s compassion for later learners truly aligns with the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and all the supreme sages across ages. The *Cantong Qi*, compared to the *Three Hundred Words of the Yin符* or the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue*, is even more detailed in its elaboration. Diligently practice it, day and night without rest. After three years of refining the elixir, you will ascend and travel afar, walk through fire unscorched, enter water undrenched, able to appear or vanish, ever joyful and free from care.

When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, remain hidden and await the time. The Supreme One will summon you, and you will be moved to the Central Continent. When your merit is complete, you will ascend, receive the registers, and be granted the talismans.

This passage speaks of the scholar who delves into the profundities of the *Cantong Qi*, refines the elixir, and attains immortality. The great Dao requires both knowledge and practice to be fully realized. Initially, one may be benighted and unaware; once aware, one may fail to practice; once practicing, one may lack diligence. When a learner receives true instruction from a master and thoroughly understands the principles of elixir refinement, they should gather companions, enter the furnace, and forge with unwavering resolve. As Laozi said: “The superior person, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.” Master Ma Danyang said: “The debt to the master’s kindness is deep and hard to repay; I vow to refine within the furnace until the true is attained.” Thus, “day and night without rest” is what constitutes diligent practice.

The work of refining the elixir may yield the pill in a single moment, yet establishing the foundation generally takes a hundred days, gestating the embryo roughly ten months, and nurturing it with warmth and care approximately three years. As Chen Cuixu said: “A moment’s effort may suffice for cultivation, but maturity requires three years.” Yet one must not rigidly fix the three-year limit—it depends on the diligence or indolence of one’s practice. Once the nurturing is complete, the sacred embryo is perfected, and one can ascend and travel afar.

From this point, the dharma-body is liberated, moving freely and unobstructed. Fire cannot burn it, water cannot drown it. It may conceal or manifest, appear or vanish—appearing, it takes form; vanishing, it leaves no trace. Unhindered in coming and going, how can one not be “ever joyful and free from care”? Embracing the primordial and holding the true is called the Dao; accumulating merit and piling up deeds is called virtue. Only when both are fully realized can one roam playfully among mortals, awaiting the time of ascension. Thus it is said: “When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, remain hidden and await the time.”

Beyond the world of dust lie the Four Seas; within the Four Seas are the Three Isles; within the Three Isles are the Ten Continents. The upper isles are Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou; the middle isles are Furong, Langyuan, and Yaochi; the lower isles are Chicheng, Yuan’guan, and Taoyuan. At their center lies a continent called the Purple Court, the abode of the Supreme One, the sovereign who oversees the merits and deeds of immortals. When one sheds the mortal shell and ascends as an immortal, they first meet the Supreme One, who examines their merits and deeds before granting them gradual ascent. Thus it is said: “The Supreme One will summon you, and you will be moved to the Central Continent.”

When merits fill the Three Thousand of the Great Veil, one becomes an immortal; when deeds fulfill the Eight Hundred of the Great Veil, one becomes a guest. Then, drifting upward, they "receive the register and accept the talisman," attaining the rank of the Supreme Perfected. Thus it is said: "When merits are complete, one ascends; receiving the register and accepting the talisman."

Though this is but a provisional analogy to guide the middle and lower streams, lest they fall into nihilistic views. In truth, the Central Continent is one’s own cinnabar chamber; the Supreme One is one’s own primordial spirit; ascent is one’s own heaven; receiving the register and accepting the talisman is the restoration of one’s original celestial countenance, no longer drifting or sinking with the kalpa’s fire. If one thoroughly comprehends the essentials of refining spirit to merge with emptiness and refining emptiness to unite with the Dao, then all ascents and talisman-receiving may be likened to floating clouds, entrusted to the vastness of space. Is this not the unspoken intent of Master Wei?

Though this chapter concludes the success of the "embryo-ingestion" practice, it serves as the summation of the entire middle section. For the "Governing the Polity" chapters merely expound the imagery of creation and transformation, without touching upon the subtleties of nature and life; the "Nurturing Nature" chapters only point to the gates of nature and life, without exhausting the functions of elixir-making. From "The Flowing Pearl of the Great Yang" onward, seven chapters fully set forth the work of embryo-ingestion—some speak of gathering, some of conjoining, some of refinement. What the first section left unsaid is here revealed without remainder.

As the section draws to a close, the author states his purpose in writing: to seal the wisdom of the ancient sages above and enlighten later worthies below. Those who follow it shall instantly become immortals and patriarchs—how could this not be firmly credible? Here, the meaning echoes the closing lines of the first section, "I dare not speak falsely, but emulate the sages’ words," confirming this as the summation of the middle section. Yet common editions mistakenly place it at the start of the lower section.

As for the passage on diligent practice, it rightly concludes this chapter, though common editions misplace it at the end of the "Discerning the Orthodox and Heterodox" section in the first part—an even greater error. Here, it is restored to its proper place according to the ancient text.

**The Lower Section (Also titled *The Three Categories* or *Supplementing Omissions and Filling Gaps*)**
The first and middle sections each divide into three parts—"Governing the Polity," "Nurturing Nature," and "Embryo-Ingestion"—though their structure appears scattered and disjointed. This section unifies their threads, bringing the three into one category. The first chapter expounds the marvelous workings of the crucible; the second reveals the full efficacy of the firing times; the third clarifies that the Three Ways arise from one, showing how divergent paths return to the same source; the fourth directly points to the return of the Four Images to emptiness, thereby grasping the primordial, limitless Daoist principle; the final chapter recounts the author’s intent in writing, concluding with a veiled name. The five chapters form a coherent whole, and the great meaning of the *Three Categories* becomes clear. What was missing or incomplete in the first two sections is here resolved without remainder. Readers should study this alongside the previous sections to grasp the underlying structure and avoid the flaw of incompleteness.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Marvelous Workings of the Crucible**
Round as three and five, a tenth of an inch in division;
The mouth, four by eight, the lips two inches wide.
Twelve inches long, thickness evenly measured.
The belly aligned with three, seated and warmly suspended.
Yin above, Yang rushing below.
Hard at the start and end, gentle in the middle.
Beginning with seventy, ending at thirty days,
Two hundred and six—skillfully harmonized.
Yin fire white, lead of the yellow sprout,
Two sevens gathered, aiding the human.
Gaze at the brain’s principle, determine the ascending mystery.
The child dwells within, secure and preserved.
Coming and going in play, never leaving the gate.
Gradually growing great, nature and emotion pure.
Returning to the One, restoring the original source.
Cherish reverence, like lord and minister.
After one cycle, the toil is intense.
Guard it closely, lest confusion arise.
The path is distant, again profound and obscure.
If you attain this, you fathom Heaven and Earth.
The elixir’s touch purifies the hun and po.
Attaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao seek its root.
Examine the Five Phases, fix the weights and measures.
Contemplate it deeply—no need for discourse.
Guard it in secrecy, do not transmit the text.
Ride the white crane, mount the dragon’s scales,
Roam the Great Void, visit the immortal lords,
Receive the celestial charts, be titled a Perfected One.

This chapter, though speaking of the wondrous workings of the crucible and furnace, already encompasses the ingredients and firing times within it—thus serving as the summation of the entire *Cantong Qi*.

The marvel of the golden elixir lies wholly in the crucible and furnace. Only by recognizing the crucible and furnace can one gather the ingredients; only by recognizing the ingredients can one apply the fire for refinement. These three are originally of the same thread and mutually interconnected. In the preceding two sections, they were separately addressed as governing governance, nurturing nature, and subduing consumption, with the three concealed within. Yet their meanings were scattered and not yet unified, so Master Wei specially composed this song to bind them together.

**"Round the Three and Five, one inch and a fraction,
Mouth of Four and Eight, lips of two inches,
Twelve inches long, thickness evenly balanced."**

This passage reveals the symbolic forms of the crucible and furnace. Their use has two aspects:

In terms of the golden elixir, the frame of *Li* (☲) is the suspended-embryo crucible, and the frame of *Kan* (☵) is the inverted-moon furnace. The central palace of the spirit-chamber is the human position—this is the symbolic form of the small crucible and furnace.

In terms of the returned elixir, the *Qian* (☰) position above serves as the crucible for congealing the elixir, while the *Kun* (☷) position below serves as the furnace for producing the medicine. The Yellow Court of the central palace is the human position—this is the symbolic form of the great crucible and furnace.

Generally, each has three layers—upper, middle, and lower—to correspond with the Three Powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Once the crucible and furnace are established, the Two Modes, Four Images, Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, twelve earthly branches, twenty-eight constellations, and the 365 degrees of the celestial circuit all emerge from within them.

The furnace and crucible take their model from *Qian* and *Kun*: round to symbolize Heaven, square to symbolize Earth.

**Round to symbolize Heaven**—this is the principle of the circular vessel. Roundness has a diameter of one and a circumference of three, derived from the *River Chart*. The *River Chart* has no corners in its circumference: east (3) and south (2) combine to form one five, north (1) and west (4) combine to form another five, while the central *wu-ji* naturally forms a third five. Together, the Three Fives form a circle. The Three Fives encircle and return to the center, where the empty position of the center has a diameter of no more than an inch—this is the chamber where the Heart of Heaven resides. Within this inch, *Qian* and *Kun* are divided, as Shaozi said: *"Heaven, from the One at the center, divides the workings of creation."* Hence it is said: **"Round the Three and Five, one inch and a fraction."**

**Square to symbolize Earth**—this is the principle of the square vessel. Squareness has a diameter of one and a circumference of four, derived from the *Luo Writing*. The *Luo Writing* has four cardinal and four diagonal directions: east, south, west, and north are the four cardinals (the Four Images), while southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest are the four diagonals. The four cardinals together with the four diagonals form the Eight Trigrams. The division between *zi* and *wu* separates north and south—the Two Modes. The opening in the center of the square vessel resembles a mouth; the boundary between the upper and lower cauldrons resembles lips. The Four Images and Eight Trigrams are arranged around the four sides, corresponding to the four seasons and eight solar terms of creation. *Qian* above and *Kun* below evenly divide the Two Modes, corresponding to the north and south poles of creation—all derived from the division of the One at the center. Hence it is said: **"Mouth of Four and Eight, lips of two inches."**

Once the Two Modes are divided, from *zi* to *si* are the six yangs, corresponding to the spring and summer of creation—this is the time for advancing the fire. From *wu* to *hai* are the six yins, corresponding to the autumn and winter of creation—this is the time for retreating the fire. The cycle of a year corresponds to that of a month, and the cycle of a month to that of a day. Hard and soft are not biased; cold and heat align with the seasons—just as the earlier section states: *"Revolving through the twelve nodes, when the cycle ends, renew the closeness."* Hence it is said: **"Twelve inches long, thickness evenly balanced."**

The workings of the crucible and furnace are drawn from afar in creation and from near in our own bodies—both belong to the natural symbolic forms. All heterodox schools, ignorant of the wondrous subtleties, vainly seek the crucible and furnace outside the body—this is no different from scaling a mountain ten thousand *li* away!

**"Abdomen aligned with three, seated to maintain warmth.
Yin above, yang rushes below.
Beginning and end with martial fire, the middle with civil.
Starting at seventy, ending at three decades,
Two hundred and six, skillfully harmonized."**

This passage speaks of the time when the medicine is born in the furnace and the fire must be carefully regulated.

Within the square inch of the central chamber lies an opening, vast and boundless, resembling an abdomen. When the water and fire *qi* converge in the central palace, the Three Families meet. At the moment of their union, one should sit and guard the central yellow, neither forgetting nor forcing, awaiting the spontaneous arrival of spirit illumination. Only when the water and fire *qi* are harmoniously balanced does warmth naturally arise, and the true seed spontaneously grow. Hence it is said: **"Abdomen aligned with three, seated to maintain warmth."**

The fire of *Li* is originally above, yet the true water within *Li* constantly flows downward to return to *wu*. The water of *Kan* is originally below, yet the true fire within *Kan* constantly rushes upward to join *ji*. All depends on the true earth in the middle for regulation. Hence it is said: **"Yin above, yang rushes below."**

This describes the state of water and fire in mutual completion, when the great medicine is about to be produced. The medicine in the furnace relies entirely on the fire for refinement, yet the firing times include both martial and civil fires. Martial fire governs refinement, while civil fire governs bathing—these two uses are as far apart as heaven and earth.

At the *zi* hour, the tail of yin and the head of yang, one should advance the fire and retreat the water. At the *wu* hour, the tail of yang and the head of yin, one should advance the water and retreat the fire—both employ martial fire. Only during the *mao* and *you* hours in the middle, at the time of bathing, is civil fire used alone. The beginning and end, evenly dividing *Kan* and *Li*, harmonize the two families without departing from the true earth in the middle. Hence it is said: **"Beginning and end with martial fire, the middle with civil."**

At the winter solstice, the first yang stirs—this is truly the beginning of the six yangs. Stillness reaches its extreme and gives birth to movement, resembling the seven-day return. Hence it is said: **"Starting at seventy."** At the summer solstice, the first yin settles—this gradually leads to the end of the six yins. Movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness, resembling the cycle from new moon to dark moon. Hence it is said: **"Ending at three decades."**

At the beginning, one must engage in "wild battle"; at the end, one guards the city—both employ martial fire, which is precisely what is meant by **"beginning and end with martial fire."** The full three hundred sixty days correspond to the degrees of the celestial revolution. Excluding the seventy-three ten-day periods (a total of one hundred days) at the beginning and end, the remaining two hundred sixty days are divided equally into yin and yang over two hundred days. One *zi* and one *wu* correspond to the winter and summer solstices, and together with one beginning and one end, they make three hundred days, exactly matching the ten-month gestation period for the embryo’s completion. The remaining sixty days correspond precisely to the two months of *mao* and *you*, one *mao* and one *you* aligning with the spring and autumn equinoxes—this is the time for bathing. Hence it is said: **"Two hundred six, well-balanced."** "Well-balanced" means neither cold nor hot, gently harmonized to the mean, which is what is meant by **"the middle with civil fire."**

One must understand that martial fire for refinement enters at the juncture of one south and one north, while civil fire for bathing is entirely a matter of inner guarding within the central palace. Thoughts must not arise, and intention must not scatter—the subtlety of the fire timing lies in this very moment. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: **"The fire timing is not bound by hours; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*. As for the bathing method, *mao* and *you* are but empty comparisons."** This is what is meant.

Yin fire is white; the yellow sprout is lead. The two sevens gather, assisting and aiding the person. Gazing at the brain’s principle, one stabilizes the ascent of the mysterious. At *zi*, abiding in the center, one attains peace and preservation. Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the gate. Gradually growing great, emotions and nature become pure. Returning to the One, one restores the original source.

This passage speaks of the initial formation of the Golden Elixir and the work of gentle nurturing within the crucible. The true mercury within *Li* (Fire) is the yin fire, yet it emerges transformed from the vastness of dry metal—an image of whiteness containing blackness. Thus it is said: **"Yin fire is white."** The true lead within *Kan* (Water) is the yellow sprout, yet it bursts forth from the womb of *Kun* (Earth)—an image of lead giving birth to gold. Thus it is said: **"The yellow sprout is lead."**

Seven is the complete number of fire. Since the flowing pearl within *Li* is called yin fire, the yellow sprout within *Kan* is called yang fire. When the two fires converge, they nurture the true person within the divine chamber, as if providing aid and wings. Thus it is said: **"The two sevens gather, assisting and aiding the person."**

When the great medicine first arises, it is born in the *Kun* crucible. When the time is ripe and the mechanism stirs, it must ascend to the *Qian* cauldron. The *Qian* cauldron lies within the Heavenly Valley at the Gate of the Brain, the aperture where all meridians converge—the alchemical classic’s meaning in **"If you wish not to age, return essence to replenish the brain."** As the medicine is born, one must use true intention to gather it, gazing upward in hesitation, sending it forth with spirit, guiding it straight to the Heavenly Valley. Thus it is said: **"Gazing at the brain’s principle, one stabilizes the ascent of the mysterious."**

Once the true seed ascends to the Heavenly Valley, it descends in turn to the Yellow Court, embodied yet subtle, like an infant at peace within the Yellow Court, roaming freely and at ease, attaining permanence in the attainment. Thus it is said: **"At *zi*, abiding in the center, one attains peace and preservation."** The infant dwells securely within the cauldron, its surroundings sealed and closed. There is no coming or going, nor any exit or entry—even if there were, it would never leave the Gate of the Original Female. Thus it is said: **"Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the gate."** Initially but a millet-grain pearl, with sufficient nurturing, it gradually grows from subtle to manifest, filling and expanding. Emotions return to nature, becoming purely refined. Thus it is said: **"Gradually growing great, emotions and nature become pure."**

This speck of true seed originally came from the Great Ultimate. From One it divided into Two, becoming two things; from Two it divided into Three, becoming the Three Families; further dividing into the Four Images, Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces—this is the Dao of descending from root to branch, the natural generation of things. Now, the two things unite, merging Three into One, so that the Four Images, Five Phases, Eight Trigrams, and Nine Palaces all return to the One. This is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin, the reversal that forms the Elixir. Thus it is said: **"Returning to the One, one restores the original source."** This **"One"** can unify the Three Teachings. The *Daodejing* says: **"Attain the One, and all affairs are complete."** The *Huangting Jing* says: **"The Five Phases mutually impel and return to the One."** Even Confucius’ **"One that pervades all"** and Śākyamuni’s **"All dharmas return to the One"** refer to this same principle. This passage consistently advocates guarding the center and embracing the One, the essential teaching of deep-rooted stability. For when the crucible contains the treasure, this work of gentle nurturing must not be lacking.

Cherish and revere it as lord and minister. Through one cycle, it is most arduous. Guard it closely, lest you fall into confusion. The path is distant, again profound and mysterious. Should you attain this, you will comprehend Heaven and Earth. The *daogui* touches, purifying soul and spirit. Attaining longevity, you dwell in the immortal village.

This passage speaks of the work of guarding against danger and considering risk. The primordial ancestral *qi* is the lord; postnatal essence-*qi* is the minister. Once the crucible has obtained the primordial One *qi*, it relies on postnatal essence-*qi* to nourish and protect it, like a minister revering the lord and the lord cherishing the minister—between lord and minister, there is perfect harmony. Thus it is said: **"Cherish and revere it as lord and minister."** In the Dao of the Elixir, nine transformations complete one cycle. Ten months form the embryo, three years nurture it—during this time, the work of drawing and adding must not be neglected in the slightest. Thus it is said: **"Through one cycle, it is most arduous."** Once the original spirit abides within the Elixir’s gate, one must guard it with true intention, closely protecting and sustaining it without the slightest lapse. If true intention ever leaves its place, there is the danger of confusion and loss. Thus it is said: **"Guard it closely, lest you fall into confusion."** The original spirit is swift without haste, arrives without moving, ascending to heaven and descending to earth in an instant—yet it is also dark and indistinct, leaving no trace. Thus it is said: **"The path is distant, again profound and mysterious."**

The Dao of the Elixir has two aspects. In terms of the Golden Elixir, when *Kan* and *Li* unite, the true seed is obtained. But in terms of the Returned Elixir, one must refine essence into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, reset the crucible and cauldron, and re-create Heaven and Earth—there is further work above. Thus it is said: **"Should you attain this, you will comprehend Heaven and Earth."** The millet-grain medicine is called *daogui*. When the *daogui* touches the mouth, the yin *po* is entirely dissolved, and the yang *hun* also becomes obscure. Thus it is said: **"The *daogui* touches, purifying soul and spirit."** This echoes the earlier passage: **"When the body dies, forget soul and spirit—the *daogui* is most divine."** Once soul and spirit are purified, one’s original nature stands alone and unshaken, no longer drifting with the kalpa’s fire, the form lodged in the dust while the spirit dwells in the Great Void. Thus it is said: **"Attaining longevity, you dwell in the immortal village."** This passage consistently conveys the meaning of careful protection, linked like strung pearls with the previous work of nurturing.

Those who delight in the Dao seek its root. Examine the Five Phases, determine the precise measures. Contemplate it deeply—no need for discussion. Guard it in deep concealment, do not transmit it in writing. Ride the white crane, mount the dragon’s scales, roam the Great Void, visit the Immortal Lords, receive the celestial charts, and be named a Perfected One.

This passage speaks of the verification of spiritual transformation after shedding the embryo. The Dao has its root—it lies solely in embracing the One. This is what Laozi meant by **"returning to the root and recovering destiny."**

People of the world seek everything among the branches and leaves, drifting ever farther from the root and growing more distant from the Dao. Thus it is said: **"Those who delight in the Dao seek its root."** The marvels of creation do not transcend the Five Phases. The Five Phases move in sequence or reversal—sequential movement produces the mundane, the creation of the worldly realm; reversal produces the sacred, the creation of the transcendent realm. Yet the principle of reversing the Five Phases is most profound and abstruse. If the slightest measure or fraction is miscalculated, the elixir will surely fail to form. Thus it is said: **"Examine the Five Phases, determine the precise measures."**

The secret of the elixir path lies entirely in the firing process. From the ancient sages, transmission must be heart-to-heart. Those who study the Dao may only hold it in the mind, not speak it aloud; they may only silently comprehend, not commit it to writing. Thus it is said: **"Contemplate it deeply—no need for discussion. Guard it in deep concealment, do not transmit it in writing."** When the firing process is complete and the sacred embryo is fully formed, at the moment of shedding the shell, one may ride a white crane or mount a fiery dragon, soaring beyond the Great Void to pay homage to the Three Realms’ Most Revered. From then on, one receives celestial registers and charts, attains the rank of Great Brahma Heaven Immortal, and is named a Perfected One.

Yet this is no external phenomenon—it is an inner vision. The dragon and crane are one’s own primordial qi; the Great Void is one’s own primordial aperture; the Immortal Lords are one’s own primordial spirit; the celestial charts are the primordial chaos of red script since time immemorial; the Perfected One is one’s original face before birth. As the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: **"All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows—if you see all phenomena as non-phenomena, you see the Tathāgata."** What Buddhism calls the Tathāgata, our Dao calls the Perfected One. If those who study the Dao but recognize the face of the Perfected One, all names and forms may be set aside and need not be discussed.

Yet the meaning of "Perfected One" has two aspects: in the realm of ordinary beings, it is called the Dharmakāya, which all possess; in the realm of sages, it is called the Reward Body, known only through realization. Ultimately, the Reward Body realized by sages is the Dharmakāya possessed by all beings. Though all possess it, because they refuse to accept it directly, they drift through life and death in vain, cycling through the Six Paths—how can this be blamed on the Creator?

This chapter, though it expounds the marvels of the cauldron and furnace, fully encompasses the ingredients and firing process. It is the summation of the Three Essentials of the Golden Elixir. Yet it must be read together with the following chapter to fully grasp the subtleties of the Three Categories.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Firing Process in Full Achievement**

No image is greater than heaven and earth—
The dark ravine spans ten thousand miles.
The River Drum nears the Star Marker,
And the people all tremble in fear.
The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats in error,
Nine years of misfortune befall.
The sovereign observes and takes heed—
The king retreats and reforms himself.
The key has its rises and falls,
And harmful qi scatters in flight.
The Yangtze and Huai run dry,
Their waters flowing into the sea.

Heaven and earth are the female and male,
Wandering between *zi* and *wu*;
*Yin* and *yang* originate in *yin* and *shen*,
Emerging and entering, ever beginning and ending.
Following the Dipper’s handle in its sweep,
Holding the balance to fix the primal order.
Rising and roasting on Mount Zeng,
Fierce fire blazes below.
The White Tiger leads the way,
The blue liquid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
Its five-colored radiance flying.
Trapped in a net cast upon it,
Pressed down, it cannot rise.
Its wails are mournful,
Like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the boiling cauldron,
Its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.
Before half the marked time has passed,
Dragon scales bristle and rise.
Five colors dazzle and gleam,
Transformations without constant master.
The cauldron seethes and surges,
Boiling violently without cease.
Layer upon layer, piled high,
Jagged as interlocking canine teeth.
In form like midwinter ice,
Railing-like stalactites emerge.
Towering and jumbled together,
Crossing and propping one another.
*Yin* and *yang* find their match,
Serene and abiding in harmony.

The Green Dragon dwells in the sixth chamber of *Fang*,
Spring blossoms in the east at *Mao*;
The White Tiger resides in the seventh star of *Mao*,
Autumn’s sharpness in the west at *You*;
The Vermilion Bird is in the second star of *Zhang*,
True *yang* in the south at *Wu*.
All three come to pay homage,
Their families and kin as dear companions.
Originally but two substances,
In the end they become three and five.
Three and five merge into one,
All gathered in a single place.
Refine them according to the method above,
Counting the days to the measure.
First white, then yellow,
Red color permeates inside and out.
This is called the First Cauldron,
Its nourishment like a grain of millet.

This is the work of nature,
Not some devious or false path.
Mountains and marshes exhale their qi,
Rising as clouds to become rain;
Dried mud turns to dust,
Extinguished fire becomes earth;
Shoots dyed yellow,
Like indigo forming green silk.
Hides boiled into glue,
Fermented grain transformed into wine.
Things of the same kind are easily worked upon,
Those of different kinds are hard to craft.
Only this wondrous art—
Examine it carefully, it does not deceive.
Passed down to countless generations,
Its brilliance is self-evident.
Shining like the stars across the Milky Way,
Glowing like the sea’s ancestral waters.
Ponder it until it is thoroughly familiar,
Review it again and again, above and below.
After a thousand cycles, it shines resplendently;
After ten thousand repetitions, it becomes visible.
Suddenly the spirit enlightens one,
The heart’s numen awakens in sudden realization.
Trace the beginning, seek its thread,
And you will surely find the gate and door.

The Dao of heaven favors no one,
Yet it is always transmitted to the worthy.

Yet within the "Fivefold Round of Three" chapters, much is said of the workings of golden elixir and the functions of warming, nurturing, and preserving its coalescence—while the operations of returning elixir, the imagery of union and refinement, remain incompletely expounded. Thus this chapter follows closely to fulfill that intent.

No image is greater than that of heaven and earth—
The Dark Gully spans tens of thousands of miles.
The Drum of the River stands over the Star Marker,
And all the people are struck with terror.
The shadow’s reckless advance and retreat—
Nine years of calamity ensue.
The August Emperor gazes upon it,
And the king retreats to amend his ways.
The pivot has its highs and lows—
Harmful qi scatters and flees.
The Jiang and Huai run dry,
Their waters flowing into the sea.

This passage speaks of the workings of fire-tending, modeled on heaven and earth—one cannot but be vigilant. The preceding chapter unfolded the imagery of the crucible and furnace: the Qian crucible emulates heaven, the Kun furnace mirrors earth. Thus the human body fully embodies a heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are but one vast crucible and furnace within me. The marvels of their transformations are wholly congruent.

The utmost height of heaven lies eighty-four thousand miles from the utmost depth of earth. The Milky Way within heaven is the Dark Gully, rising between the *wei* and *ji* constellations (stars of the Twenty-Eight Mansions) in the *chou* and *yin* positions, extending to the boundary of the *xing* and *liu* stars in the *wu* and *wei* positions—severing the celestial plate for who knows how many tens of thousands of miles. Within my body, the Celestial Pass and Earthly Axis are likewise separated by eighty-four thousand miles, the space between them forming the Dark Gully, demarcating above and below with the imagery of metal and wood in alternation. Hence it is said: “No image is greater than that of heaven and earth— / The Dark Gully spans tens of thousands of miles.”

The Drum of the River comprises three stars: the central one is the Great General, the left is the Left General, and the right is the Right General. With their radiant edges, they govern the sounds of military drums. Located north of the Ox Mansion, they rest directly upon the Star Marker of the Milky Way, corresponding to the *chou* position among the twelve earthly branches—precisely where the Milky Way traverses. The Drum of the River is not inherently a star of the *chou* division; its untimely appearance over the Star Marker signals disorder among the constellations within the Milky Way, foretelling the rise of water disasters—no wonder it evokes terror. At the juncture of *zi* and *chou* within my body lies the very ground where yang fire arises. If one acts recklessly before the proper time, the essence and qi of the entire body scatter in disarray, and the hundred vessels fall into chaos—is this not the very image of the people struck with terror? Hence it is said: “The Drum of the River stands over the Star Marker, / And all the people are struck with terror.”

The *mian* cap and its counterpart pertain to the sun’s shadow—here borrowed to describe the degrees of celestial bodies’ advance and retreat. Within the body, this corresponds to the increments of advancing and retreating fire. Advancing fire is “advance,” retreating fire is “retreat.” To advance when one should not, or retreat when one should not—whether excessive or deficient—is like the solstices and equinoxes failing to align with the water-clock’s measures, thereby summoning floods and droughts. According to the above, the Drum of the River’s position over the Star Marker signifies an improper advance of fire, leading to water disasters. Yao suffered nine years of flooding, hence it is said: “The shadow’s reckless advance and retreat— / Nine years of calamity ensue.” Nine years correspond to the imagery of nine revolutions. If the advance of fire is misaligned in the first revolution, all nine are lost—is this not the gravest of calamities?

The August Emperor refers to the Lord on High, the king to the human sovereign. “Gazes upon it” means making the warning manifest to the sovereign, for celestial portents serve as admonitions—precisely the “calamity” mentioned above. “Retreats to amend his ways” means correcting the errors of “advance and retreat” so that progression and regression align with proper measure. The August Emperor symbolizes the prenatal nature, the king the postnatal heart—their essence is one, though their functions differ. Nature governs non-action, abiding in stillness, resting in the chamber of spirit. The heart governs action, responding immediately to stimuli, revolving the celestial warp. Thus the advance and retreat of fire-tending will invariably hit the mark. Hence it is said: “The August Emperor gazes upon it, / And the king retreats to amend his ways.”

The pivot of the Dao of heaven lies entirely in the north and south poles. The north pole rises thirty-six degrees above the earth, the south pole sinks thirty-six degrees below—an image of low and high. The celestial sphere revolves day and night without cease, yet though the north and south poles govern its rotation, they never depart from their positions. Thus the warp and weft proceed in order, and harmful qi does not arise. Within my body, the Celestial Pass and Earthly Axis likewise rise and fall, corresponding to the north and south poles. When tending the fire, the pivot must be secure—this is to hold the Celestial Pass in hand and embody the Earthly Axis in form and heart. At this stage, the yin qi of the entire body naturally sheds away without residue. Hence it is said: “The pivot has its highs and lows— / Harmful qi scatters and flees.”

Heaven generates water, which inundates the great earth. Only with the vast sea as its destination can flooding be averted. Within the human body, inside and out, nothing is not yin dregs—the confluence of all waters. At the summit of Kunlun lies the Primordial Sea, the gathering place of all waters. Only when the pivots of the north and south poles are secure, compelling the hundred vessels to return to the origin, does qi naturally flow back to the Primordial Sea—like the Jiang and Huai rivers converging in the sea without causing floods. Hence it is said: “The Jiang and Huai run dry, / Their waters flowing into the sea.”

This passage begins by likening the celestial Dark Gully to the imagery of the crucible and furnace, then uses the movements of celestial bodies to illustrate the standards of fire-tending. Misalignment invites the disaster of floods, while proper alignment brings the blessing of returning to the origin. Gain and loss—here lies the measure of fire-tending. This is the guiding principle of the entire chapter.

The female and male of heaven and earth—
They linger between *zi* and *wu*.
The *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,
Exiting and entering, repeating their beginning and end.
Following the Dipper’s swaying handle,
Grasping the balance to fix the primal order.

This passage speaks of the union of Kan and Li, the imagery of their conjoining. *Zi* is the head of the six yang, corresponding to the winter solstice...

*Wu* marks the head of the six *yin*, corresponding to the summer solstice. The two phases of *zi* and *wu*—one *yin*, one *yang*—serve as the north-south axis, the very ground where water and fire meet. When the sun and moon reach this point, they linger, neither advancing nor retreating in haste. Thus, when the sun stands at high noon, the ancients called it *tingwu* ("pausing at *wu*"), signifying this very hesitation. In the alchemy of the Elixir, the ascent and descent of water and fire occur solely within the *zi* and *wu* phases. When the true fire within Kan ascends, the first *yang* stirs anew, its *qi* still faint—one must close the gates to nurture the sprouting of the latent dragon. When the true water within Li descends, the first *yin* arrives in union, its *qi* just budding—one must fasten the crossbar to guard against the first frost’s encroachment. The marvel of creation lies entirely between *wu*-after and *zi*-before, where true intent must linger in hesitation. Thus it is said: *"The female and male of heaven and earth— / They linger between *zi* and *wu*."*

Though the embryo of *yang* fire takes form at *zi*, it is not born until *yin*; though the embryo of *yin* water takes form at *wu*, it is not born until *shen*. The sun, infused with the essence of fire, rises at *yin* and sets at *shen*; the moon, infused with the essence of water, rises at *shen* and sets at *yin*. Clearly, *yin* and *shen* are the ancestral homeland of *yin* and *yang*, the gate through which creation enters and exits. The Dao of the Elixir mirrors this: though the first *yang* within Kan revives at *zi*, it is not until the *yin* position that the true fire emerges from the earth; though the first *yin* within Li unites at *wu*, it is not until the *shen* position that the true water attains growth. One emerges, one enters—endlessly repeating their beginning and end—only then does one witness the true *yin* and true *yang*, born of the same ancestral source yet bearing different names. Thus it is said: *"The *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of *yin* and *yang*, / Exiting and entering, repeating their beginning and end."*

The star *Zhaoyao* lies north of *Genghe*, its rays sharp as blades; when its rays stir, war is sure to follow. The fifth star of the Northern Dipper is named *Heng* ("Balance"), the Dipper’s handle, governing the administration of the celestial center and the regulation of the four directions. Whether pointing to *zi* and *wu* or to *yin* and *shen*, it fixes the positions of wood, metal, water, and fire, and divides the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Though *Zhaoyao* tends toward reckless motion, if it follows the Dipper’s handle in its movement, its motion will align with the seasons, never losing its guiding principle. The Dao of the Elixir emulates heaven, relying entirely on the turning of the Celestial Heart and the shifting of the Dipper’s handle. The Celestial Heart abides motionless at the North Pole, observing only the direction of the Dipper’s handle. When the handle points to *zi* and *wu*, water and fire linger in hesitation; when it points to *yin* and *shen*, metal and wood converge in union. This is akin to *Zhaoyao* following the Dipper’s movement to establish the guiding principles of the celestial sphere. Thus it is said: *"Following the Dipper’s swaying handle, / Grasping the balance to fix the primal order."*

This passage explains how water and fire unite, how metal and wood merge—all through the turning of the Dipper’s handle. Such is the initial work of the union of Kan and Li. When Kan and Li conjoin, the true seed is born. Only when the first *yang* stirs and the Dipper’s handle aligns with *zi* may the work of refinement begin!

Rising to be refined upon the steamer-mountain,
With blazing fire arrayed below.
The White Tiger leads the way in front,
The Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
Its five-colored radiance in flight.
Yet it encounters the spread of nets,
Pressed down, unable to rise.
Its cries are mournful and sorrowful,
Like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the seething cauldron,
Its feathers and wings crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra’s measure has passed,
Dragon scales and manes begin to bristle.
Five hues shimmer and dazzle,
Transforming without constancy.
The cauldron boils and surges,
Violently churning without cease.
Layer upon layer, piled in heaps,
Jagged as interlocking canine teeth.
Its form resembles midwinter ice,
With stalactites jutting forth.
Towering and jumbled,
Intertwined and propped against one another.
When *yin* and *yang* find their match,
They rest in tranquil harmony.

This passage speaks of the union of Qian and Kun, the imagery of their refinement. Earlier, the union of Kan and Li gave birth to the true seed. Now, with further work of conjoining, the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir is nurtured within the Kun furnace—hence the term "refinement," the very "pivot of refinement" mentioned in the previous section. Once the furnace’s nurturing is complete and the first *yang* stirs, precisely at the hour of *zi*, one must swiftly apply fire in response. This requires fierce refinement and extreme forging, along with the work of *shi* (licking), *cuo* (gathering), and *bi* (closing), compelling the golden fluid within the furnace to ascend. Seizing the fire’s momentum, one drives the River Chariot from the *Weilü* cavity, reversing its flow to ascend the Kunlun peak—this is the image of "rising to be refined upon the steamer-mountain." As the *Cuixu Pian* states: *"At the hour of *zi*, when *qi* reaches the *Weilü* Pass, / The River Chariot crosses the steamer-mountain."* Such is the meaning here. Thus it is said: *"Rising to be refined upon the steamer-mountain, / With blazing fire arrayed below."*

The metal essence of the West is the White Tiger; the wood fluid of the East is the Azure Dragon. The dragon, *yang*, leads; the tiger, *yin*, harmonizes. Now, the tiger reverses to lead in front, while the dragon reverses to harmonize behind—this is the image of the Five Phases moving in reverse, *yin* and *yang* overturned. Thus it is said: *"The White Tiger leads the way in front, / The Azure Fluid harmonizes behind."* This marks the great union, where one seals the senses, closes the gates, and employs the work of blowing, inhaling, and absorbing spirit—a practice distinct from the earlier union of Kan and Li. One must discern this carefully.

The Vermilion Bird is the fire essence of the South, stationed in the Li palace—the very "blazing fire" mentioned above. Its nature is flighty and restless; at the slightest encounter with illusory sensory forms, it soars away, beyond control.

Thus it is said:
*"The Vermilion Bird soars and sports,
Its five-colored radiance in flight."*

The Vermilion Bird’s nature is inherently soaring and buoyant—nothing can restrain it—until it encounters the Dark Warrior of the North, whereupon it surrenders and submits. At the moment of Qian and Kun’s union, fire ascends from below while water descends from above; the Dark Warrior seizes the Vermilion Bird, binding it fast in mutual restraint, refusing to release even unto death, as though trapped in a net, its wings pressed down and unable to lift. Thus it is said:
*"Encountering the net’s spread,
Pressed down, it cannot rise."*

Fire, by nature, flames upward; once suppressed by water, its temperament grows frantic, longing to ascend—like an infant parted from its mother, wailing in sorrowful yearning, its cries plaintive. Thus it is said:
*"Its wails so mournful,
Like an infant’s longing for its mother."*

With fire ascending and water descending, host and guest reverse; the Vermilion Bird and the Dark Warrior devour each other, sealed within the crucible, unable to escape—like feathers broken, never again to take flight. Thus it is said:
*"Overturned into the seething cauldron,
Feathers crushed and broken."*

Once water and fire seize and restrain each other, the dragon and tiger must also submit. The four images—Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire—converge within the crucible, firmly sealed without leakage. In but a moment, the elixir coalesces. With the five phases’ *qi* gathered in the crucible, transformation arises spontaneously, like a divine dragon traversing the sky, its scales stirring and mane tossing, its five-colored brilliance dazzling and indescribable in its shifts. Thus it is said:
*"Before half a *lou-ke* has passed,
Dragon scales and manes rise.
Five hues in dazzling display,
Transformations without fixed master."*

As the crucible seethes and roils, dragon and tiger contend, shaking heaven and earth. In an instant, golden essence pierces the crown, silver waves surge like a tide, as though the steamer’s rice nears readiness, the crucible’s waters boiling without cease, surging forth in torrents. Thus it is said:
*"The crucible’s bubbling rush,
Violent surging without rest."*

Just as the boiling reaches its peak, the fire’s force is redoubled, layered and continuous, steaming without end—until the fire is full and the *qi* complete. Within the crucible, true *qi* naturally suffuses and intermingles, like interlocking canine teeth. Thus it is said:
*"Layer upon layer piled,
Like interlocking fangs."*

Once the union is complete, the golden crucible’s waters grow warm, the jade furnace’s fire disperses, and a single drop falls into the Yellow Court—first as liquid, then congealing, gradually solidifying into firmness, like midwinter’s ice, or stalactites bursting from the lattice of stone. Thus it is said:
*"Form like midwinter’s ice,
Latticed stone yielding stalactites."*

The crucible’s true fluid and *qi* circulate: the light and pure congeal in the Mud Pill Palace, while the heavy and turbid return to the *qi* cavern, presenting an image of towering peaks interspersed; the true seed having congealed, the formless generates form, like intersecting supports propping one another. Thus it is said:
*"Towering yet intermingled,
Interlocking like propping beams."*

All the above are the phenomena of obtaining the medicine and forming the elixir in that moment. For when Qian and Kun unite in great congress, true *yin* and true *yang* pair without flaw, hence the signs described. From this point, the war ceases, and the city is guarded with gentle fire—neither forgetting nor forcing—quietly tending the Central Yellow, as in the saying: *"Send it to the earthen cauldron, sealed and secured."* Thus it is said:
*"Yin and yang find their match,
Abiding in tranquil harmony."*

This passage concerns the moment of Qian and Kun’s union: the preceding speaks of the refining method, the middle of the coalescing imagery, and the end of the nurturing work—it is the pivotal point of the entire chapter.

The Azure Dragon dwells in House Six,
Spring’s blossoms at the eastern *mao*.
The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,
Autumn’s awns at the western *you*.
The Vermilion Bird in Zhang Two,
True yang at the southern *wu*.
All three come to court,
Kin as intimate companions.
Originally but two things,
Yet in the end, three and five.
Three and five merge as one,
All gathered in a single place.
Refine them as prescribed above,
Counting the days to completion.
First white, then yellow,
Red suffusing inside and out.
Named the First Crucible,
Its measure like a great millet grain.

This section speaks of the four images and five phases merging into one—such are the phenomena of elixir formation. Earlier, at the moment of great union, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird were all overturned and moving in reverse; here, they return to their proper positions.

The Azure Dragon’s true position is in the East. The eastern constellation House belongs to Wood, its number eight, yet here called "House Six"—for six is Water’s completion number, and Wood is born in *hai*; Wood’s essence originally flows from Kan Water, as the *Ru Yao Jing* calls it: *"Lead Dragon."* The eastern dragon corresponds to spring, the trigram Zhen, the hour *mao*; Wood flourishes in *mao*, when grasses and trees blossom into flowers. Thus it is said:
*"The Azure Dragon dwells in House Six,
Spring’s blossoms at the eastern *mao*."*

The White Tiger’s true position is in the West. The western constellation Pleiades belongs to Metal, its number nine, yet here called "Pleiades Seven"—for seven is Fire’s completion number, and Metal is born in *si*; Metal’s essence is originally forged from Li Fire, as the *Ru Yao Jing* terms it: *"Mercury Tiger."* The western tiger corresponds to autumn, the trigram Dui, the hour *you*; Metal flourishes in *you*, when grains ripen and awns form.

Thus it is said:
*"The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven,
Autumn’s awns at the western *you*."*
The Vermilion Bird’s true position is in the South. The southern constellation Zhang belongs to Fire, and two is Fire’s generative number. The southern Vermilion Bird corresponds to summer, the trigram Li, the hour *wu*; Fire flourishes in *wu*, capable of burning Wood and smelting Metal. Thus it is said:
*"The Vermilion Bird in Zhang Two,
True Yang at the southern *wu* of Li."*

At the time of their convergence, one from the East, one from the West, one from the South—all come to pay homage and encircle the North Star, the Pole of Heaven. The three families gather into one, disparate bones become kin, rejoicing in great peace. Thus it is said:
*"When the three come to pay homage,
Their households become intimate companions."*

Here, the three symbols of Wood, Metal, and Fire correspond precisely to the preceding passage. The earlier and later sections both omit the Dark Warrior, for the Dark Warrior’s true position lies in the North, directly aligned with the pivot of the Dipper. Since the three come to encircle the North Star, the Dark Warrior is already within them—this is the meaning of the middle section’s *"nine returns, seven reversions, eight returns, six abodes."*

Originally, it is the union of true Yin and true Yang. Yet one Dragon, one Tiger, and the Fire of the South together form the three families. Wood and Fire become companions, Metal and Water become friends; when the Earth of the Center is included, the Five Phases are complete. Tracing their root and stock, they are but two substances that branch into three families and five phases, combining to form the number fifteen of three and five. Thus it is said:
*"Their root is but two things,
Their branches become three and five."*

In the beginning, from root to branch, they originally issue from a single stock: one divides into two, two into three, three into five—this is the ordinary Dao’s forward sequence. In the end, from branch back to root, they are gathered again into a single stock: five returns to three, three to two, two to one—this is the Reversed Dao of the Elixir. Thus it is said:
*"Three and five merge into one,
All gather to return to the One Place."*

"Merge into one" refers to the primordial One Qi, the true seed. "Return to the One Place" refers to the Central True Position, the Yellow Court. When three and five become one, it is the transmission from the hearts of the supreme sages, like statutes that cannot be violated. Following this in cultivation, the Elixir is certain to form—yet it is not the work of a single day. Only through accumulation over months and years is accomplishment attained. Still, one must take the first turning, the initial point of the true seed, as the foundation. Thus it is said:
*"Cultivate it according to the statutes above,
Counting the days from the very beginning."*

"Counting the days" refers to the three years of refining and ingestion. "Beginning" refers to the first turning, the starting point. The Elixir’s initial coagulation is inherently pure gold. When the seed is further planted in the Qian Palace, its color is purely white. By the time it descends to the Yellow Court and is sent into the Earth Cauldron, nurtured by the Qi of the Kun Mother, it gradually transforms into a yellow hue. From beginning to end, refined by the Fire of Li in the South, its color blazes red through and through—this is called the Returned Elixir. Thus it is said:
*"First white, then yellow,
Its red color permeates inside and out."*

Each turning of the Elixir corresponds to one tripod; nine tripods correspond to nine turnings. Yet within one turning are already nine turnings, so the work of nine tripods is wholly contained in the first tripod. After Qian and Kun unite in *gou*, with bathing and gentle nurturing, the millet-pearl naturally coagulates in the tripod. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: *"The Primordial Beginning suspended a precious pearl, large as a millet grain, within the Empty Origin... Heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging brilliance entering through the pearl’s opening."* This is the meaning here. Thus it is said:
*"Named the First Tripod,
Its ingestion like a great millet grain."*

This passage speaks of the four symbols and five phases merging into one, the proof of the Elixir’s coagulation. It is the work of nature itself, not some deviant or false path. As the Qi of mountains and marshes steam together, clouds arise and become rain; when mud dries and crumbles, it turns to dust; when fire extinguishes, it transforms into earth. Like the yellow dye extracted from the *huai* tree, or the green silk woven from indigo—leather boiled becomes glue, yeast and grains ferment into wine. Work is easily done among those of the same kind, but skill avails little with the wrong seed. This section describes the Elixir’s success, which arises from the Dao of nature itself.

All the above processes of union and coagulation are but the mutual matching of true Yin and true Yang, returning to my primordial Empty-Origin One Qi. Though it is spoken of as "having action," it is in truth "non-action," all emerging from the natural mechanism of Heaven. It is not like the heterodox minor arts—manipulation, absorption, and various strange fabrications used to deceive the world and delude the masses. This is what the Most High meant by *"the Dao follows nature."* The marvel of the Elixir’s natural Dao accords with the transformations of Heaven and human affairs without discrepancy. When the two Qi interact and steam together, they transform into true liquid—just as the Qi of mountains and marshes naturally steam to form clouds and coalesce into rain. Thus it is said:
*"As the Qi of mountains and marshes steam together,
Clouds arise and become rain."*

Mud’s nature is heavy and stagnant, seemingly unlike dust—yet when it dries and crumbles, it naturally transforms into dust. Fire’s nature is soaring and scattering, seemingly unlike earth—yet when its flames fade and smoke cools, it naturally transforms into earth.

Just as the sprouts of a stump are inherently yellow, when dyed, they naturally become yellow; indigo is inherently green, when woven into silk, it naturally becomes green. Leather is the very source of glue, naturally boiled to form glue; yeast and sprouts are the essence of wine, naturally fermented to become wine. All these are of the same kind, each returning to its origin.

Thus, the workings of transformation are natural, without the slightest trace of artificial contrivance. The Reverted Elixir is no different: the true fire within *Kan* originally emerges from *Qian*, its nature ever desiring to ascend and return to *Qian*; the true water within *Li* originally emerges from *Kun*, its nature ever desiring to descend and return to *Kun*. Moreover, when the dragon intones, clouds arise of themselves; when the tiger roars, wind stirs of itself. As the two *qi* interact, each follows its kind—how could it not be efficacious?

This is what is meant by: *"To refine the immortal elixir, one must use those of the same kind."* How could solitary yin or orphaned yang—all that are not of the same kind—compare? Thus it is said: *"With the same kind, effort is easily applied; without the proper seed, skill is difficult to achieve."*

This passage speaks of the cause of success in the Elixir’s Dao, which lies solely in the two characters *natural* and *same kind*. Only the true seed is originally of the same kind, so their interaction arises from the natural—this cannot be unknown. Such is the marvel of this art, examined in truth and without deceit. Transmitted to the myriad ages to come, its brilliance will be self-evident for all to verify.

Radiant as stars traversing the Han River, resplendent as waters converging in the sea. Ponder it thoroughly, turning it over to examine above and below. After a thousand cycles, its brilliance shines resplendent; after ten thousand repetitions, it may at last be perceived. Suddenly the numinous reveals itself to one, and the heart’s spirit awakens in sudden comprehension. Tracing its beginnings and seeking its threads, one must find its gate and door.

The Dao of Heaven admits no favoritism, yet it is ever transmitted to the worthy. This passage serves as the conclusion to the entire chapter. It speaks of the marvelous Dao of like seeking like and natural interaction—passed down from the ancient sages through the mind-seal of the master, silently realized in secret, without a single word falsely set forth. Thus it is said: *"Such is the marvel of this art, examined in truth and without deceit."* The Great Dao knows no past or present, no before or after; a thousand ages above or a thousand ages below, this heart and this principle remain ever in accord. To read its text is as if to meet its author in person. Thus it is said: *"Transmitted to the myriad ages to come, its brilliance will be self-evident for all to verify."*

The secrets of the firing times are fully recorded herein: in Heaven, they correspond to the stars, like the host of stars traversing the River of Stars; on Earth, they correspond to the tides, like the myriad waters converging in the great sea—without the slightest deviation, not a drop lost. Thus it is said: *"Radiant as stars traversing the Han River, resplendent as waters converging in the sea."* These two lines echo the earlier passage: *"The River Drum and Star Records, the Yangtze and Huai flowing to the sea."*

Within this text, the firing times must be studied not only by recitation but by contemplation; not only by contemplation but by embodiment. The yang fire and yin tally within the body circulate ceaselessly, ascending and descending in every moment. Yet one must not see with the eyes but with the spirit—only then is it attained. Thus it is said: *"Ponder it thoroughly, turning it over to examine above and below."*

From one cycle to endless cycles, from one repetition to ten thousand, the turning continues without cease—*"ever revolving thus, through a thousand, a hundred million scrolls,"* not merely one or two. Thus it is said: *"After a thousand cycles, its brilliance shines resplendent; after ten thousand repetitions, it may at last be perceived."*

Guanzi said: *"Ponder it, ponder it again, and ponder it once more; if still not grasped, the spirits will make it known."* In all ordinary inquiry, one should proceed thus. How much more so with this sacred firing record, where one must not see with the eyes but with the spirit?

After a thousand cycles and ten thousand repetitions, the heart’s spirit suddenly awakens, and wisdom’s nature becomes naturally luminous. All matters, worldly and transcendent, are seen with perfect clarity, as if the spirits themselves had come to reveal it. Thus it is said: *"Suddenly the numinous reveals itself to one, and the heart’s spirit awakens in sudden comprehension."*

The Great Elixir’s Dao has its beginnings and threads, its gates and doors. True yin and true yang, like seeking like—these are its beginnings and threads. Kan and Li unite to produce the medicine; Qian and Kun interact to form the Elixir—one inner, one outer, twofold in function—these are its gates and doors. If later students can trace and seek them, once the threads are grasped, they may glimpse the gates and doors of the Great Dao. Thus it is said: *"Tracing its beginnings and seeking its threads, one must find its gate and door."* Here, the term *"gate and door"* precisely echoes the opening of the first chapter: *"Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the Changes."*

This matter is originally complete in every person, perfectly realized in each. Yet the Great Dao is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, and one must choose the right recipient. To meet someone and not transmit it is to incur the fault of obstructing the Dao of Heaven.

To transmit it to an unworthy recipient is to incur the blame of divulging Heaven’s treasure. Only those of loyal, filial, pure, luminous, benevolent, and upright character—who can moreover sever worldly attachments of affection and cast off all mundane toils—are fit to receive this Dao. As the saying goes: *"The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it is ever transmitted to the worthy."* The Immortal Elder, having expounded the essentials of the firing process, repeatedly and earnestly emphasizes the need to choose the right recipient, revealing a heart both vast and prudent.

Though this chapter describes the firing process and its symbolic correspondences, it serves in truth to conclude the entire work. The preceding chapter was the general summation; this is its closing exposition. The two chapters form a complete whole, and the essential principles of governance, nurturing nature, and ingesting the elixir are all contained within. Each passage may be cross-referenced and verified—precisely what is meant by *"the threefold correspondence."* The discerning will naturally understand.

**Chapter Thirty-Four of the Three Ways Converging in One**
The *Cantong Qi* presents an outline but lacks unity, its discourse diffuse, its finer points incomplete, its details vague and fragmentary. Here, I have compiled and supplemented omissions, refined obscure passages, linked scattered threads, aligned the intent, and ensured the direction remains unerring. Thus, I have composed this chapter and named it *"The Threefold Correspondence."* In this way, the nature and feelings of the *Great Change* are fully revealed.

The nature and feelings of the *Great Change* each adhere to their proper measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, when thoroughly investigated, may be applied in practice. The work of the furnace and fire has a true basis. The Three Ways converge in one, all emerging from the same path. Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—fruit hangs in abundance—yet all depend on the root, never losing their original essence. What is spoken here is sincere, examined, and without error.

This chapter explains that governance, nurturing nature, and ingesting the elixir—though distinct paths—ultimately return to the same Dao. The *Cantong Qi* presents an outline but lacks unity, its discourse diffuse, its finer points incomplete, its details vague and fragmentary. Here, I have compiled and supplemented omissions, refined obscure passages, linked scattered threads, aligned the intent, and ensured the direction remains unerring. Thus, I have composed this chapter and named it *"The Threefold Correspondence."* In this way, the nature and feelings of the *Great Change* are fully revealed. This explains the origin and convergence of the Three Ways in One.

The *Cantong Qi* originally derives from the River Chart and Luo Scripture, expounding the trigrams of Fuxi to reveal the precelestial mind and the *Changes*. Yet it must be grounded in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, employing the symbolic correspondences of the furnace and fire. Only when the Three Schools are mutually referenced and converge in one does it fully accord with the great Dao of realizing nature and destiny.

However, the first two chapters artificially divide the single Dao into three schools, resulting in uneven prose and obscured principles. Therefore, this later chapter is composed to explicitly articulate the idea of correspondence. The chapters *"The Marvelous Function of the Crucible"* and *"The Complete Achievement of the Firing Process"* have already clarified its structure. Yet the principle of the Three Ways converging in One remains unexposed. The Master Wei further explains that in the *Cantong Qi*, the first two chapters merely present an outline, lacking unity, with much diffuse language, while finer subtleties are often omitted or unclear. Hence, this supplementary chapter could not be omitted.

Thus, obscure passages in the earlier text are refined; scattered elements are linked and drawn together. In this way, the principles of the Three Schools return to one, and their direction does not deviate. Governance, nurturing nature, and ingesting the elixir—when summarized, they are called *"the threefold correspondence."* In a single phrase, they are simply *"the nature and feelings of the Great Change."*

For the *Changes* are but the sun and moon—Kan and Li, two things: one yin, one yang; one nature, one feeling. Ultimately, they reduce to the two words *body* and *mind*. If one can harmonize body and mind with the true intent of the Central Yellow, uniting the two in the center, this alone suffices to embody the Dao of all under Heaven. What the Yellow Emperor and Laozi nurture is this alone; what the furnace and fire refine is this alone.

This is why they are called *"the threefold correspondence."* This is why the *threefold correspondence* constitutes the *Triple Concordance.* Observing the "Furnace and Cauldron" chapter, it speaks only of furnace and cauldron, yet the medicinal substances and firing times are already fully presented. In the "Firing Times" chapter, it speaks only of firing times, yet the medicinal substances, furnace, and cauldron are also entirely encompassed—thus one comprehends the great purport of the *threefold correspondence!*

In the *Great Change,* feelings and nature each accord with their measure. In the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, investigation is applied, and governance becomes possible. The work of furnace and fire is truly grounded in evidence. The Three Ways emerge from one, all proceeding from the same path. Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—fruits hang in abundance—yet all reside in the rootstock, never departing from their original simplicity.

What is spoken here arises from sincere intent, carefully considered and without error. This passage precisely elucidates how the Three Ways return to one. Yet世人 merely see that the *Triple Concordance* is divided into three sections, demarcating governance, nurturing nature, and ingesting the elixir, and thus believe these to be three distinct schools. When they speak of the *Great Change,* they take it as mere yin-yang cosmology and drift into sexual arts. When they speak of nurturing nature, they fixate on the bodily form and mind, clinging to preservation. When they speak of furnace and fire, they take it as refining cinnabar and mercury, descending into mere alchemy. The three schools cling to their own views, each failing to communicate with the others—truly a millennia-long night! For fourteen or fifteen hundred years, the *Triple Concordance* has lain buried in the depths, unseen by the light of day.

Heaven does not withhold the Dao; now it is dissected and made clear. The *Great Change’s* nature and feelings precisely refer to the two things Kan and Li. The sun and moon are the *Change*; true essence mutually conceals itself. The two words *feeling* and *nature* are one metal and one wood, one water and one fire, one hun and one po, one dragon and one tiger, one man and one woman—yet in truth, they are but one body and one mind. Body and mind, these two, are naturally paired, forged into one—are they not the medicinal substances of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: *"In the Great Change, feelings and nature each accord with their measure."*

As for the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s nurturing of nature, it may seem to refer to their principle of purity and non-action. Yet they knew that the head contains nine palaces, with the Yellow Court at the center, the dwelling of the Central Yellow Lord. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"The Central Lord governs the Hall of Light."* The Yellow Court is the central yellow position, also called the *Abode of Spirit Virtue,* the *Dao’s Dwelling Furnace,* the *Great Abyss,* or the *Regulating Center*—roughly the primordial ancestral aperture. Recognizing the ancestral aperture, the original spirit has a place to return, and one understands the application of nurturing nature. Its function relies entirely on true intent. With this true intent, body and mind are harmonized, the handle held in hand—is this not the furnace and cauldron of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: *"In the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, investigation is applied, and governance becomes possible."*

As for the work of furnace and fire, it borrows external imagery to illustrate internal practice. Once the medicinal substances enter the furnace, fire must be applied to refine them. Whether paired as dragon and tiger, mercury and lead, flowing pearls and golden blossoms, or yellow sprouts and maiden, these various names all refer to the two things of body and mind. To restrain them is called *"subduing,"* to unite them is called *"ingesting"*—still, it is the harmonizing of body and mind with true intent. One subjugation and one ingestion complete the work of the golden elixir’s furnace and fire, its principle firmly grounded—is this not the firing time of the golden elixir? Thus it is said: *"The work of furnace and fire is truly grounded in evidence."*

Without medicinal substances, there can be no furnace and cauldron; without furnace and cauldron, there can be no firing times. These three are of the same thread, mutually entailing. Mention one, and all three are fully present. Though divided into three sections, their function is never separate. Know that the various names for medicinal substances in the text all refer to one thing; the various names for furnace and cauldron all refer to one place; the various names for firing times all refer to one moment. If one understands this one thing, one knows that all living beings are but this one thing. If one understands this one place, one knows that mountains, rivers, and the great earth all reside in this one place. If one understands this one moment, one knows that kalpas and epochs are but this one moment. For this one thing is this one place, this one place is this one moment, and this one moment is this one thing.

This is called *"uniting the three in one"* and *"grasping the one, all affairs are complete."* Thus it is said: *"The Three Ways emerge from one, all proceeding from the same path."* Originally, there was but one Way, yet when analyzed, it becomes three paths—like plants and trees that sprout stems and branches in spring, bloom with flowers and leaves in summer, and bear fruit in autumn. Yet the source of their growth lies solely in the rootstock. Only when winter strips them bare, returning to the root, does the marvel of the fruit’s generative power become manifest. Thus it is said: *"Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—fruits hang in abundance—yet all reside in the rootstock, never departing from their original simplicity."* This *simplicity* is the *primordial simplicity,* the meaning of returning to the origin.

From one Way branching into three paths, there is the image of stems, branches, flowers, and fruit—this is what is meant by *"revealing the branches."* From three paths returning to one Way, there is the image of the rootstock—this is what is meant by *"concealing the root."* Though the previous two chapters are divided into three sections, appearing like branches, the rootstock’s oneness never fails to run through them. What is spoken arises from sincere intent, but the reader must examine it repeatedly, pondering it thousands of times until enlightenment suddenly dawns. Only then will one know that the Three Ways truly emerge from one, and not be misled by heterodox paths. Thus it is said: *"What is spoken here arises from sincere intent, carefully considered and without error."*

This chapter is the crux of the *threefold correspondence.* Master Wei feared that people might mistake one Way for three paths, or mistake three paths for not being one Way. Thus he explicitly pointed out the root source, emphasizing the two phrases *"all reside in the rootstock"*—but ultimately, what *is* the rootstock?

At the first stirring of the solitary Yang, the heart of Heaven and Earth is revealed, and the marvel of creation-and-transformation resides within it—this is why the three Ways, though diverging in path, converge in return, and the single phrase of the *Cantong Qi* suffices to encompass them. Thus, immediately following the chapter *"Like the Midwinter Season,"* according to the common edition, this chapter originally included a *"Fivefold Correspondence Diagram,"* forcibly aligning it with the *Hetu*’s five positions, each attaining harmony in its own way. This tradition began with Peng Xiao and others, becoming an unshakable convention. Yet a close examination of Master Wei’s original intent reveals that this chapter clearly speaks of the three Ways—governing affairs, nurturing nature, and refining the elixir—emerging from one, hence *"threefold correspondence,"* not *"fivefold correspondence."* For the east’s three and the south’s two unite as one family, the north’s one and the west’s four unite as another, while the central five and ten form their own family. In the threefold correspondence, the marvel of the five positions attaining harmony is already inherent—why add superfluous limbs? Moreover, the three Ways arising from one not only run through the preceding and following chapters but are the very crux of the entire work. How could there be any extraneous meaning to interpose? Furthermore, their so-called *"floating left, sinking right,"* *"generational gold, generational silver,"* and other forced interpretations all veer into the collateral paths of furnace-and-fire, utterly contradicting the work’s grand meaning. They disrupt the coherence of the text’s bloodline, and collation with ancient editions reveals no such diagram. It is clear that this was Peng Xiao’s fabrication, not Master Wei’s original text, and thus it is excised.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Four Phases Return to the Root**
*"Like the Midwinter Season,"*
Grasses and trees all wither and break.
Assisting Yang, it questions merchants and travelers;
The lord of men deeply conceals himself.
Emulating the season, following its decree,
Seal the mouth, refrain from speech.
The Way of Heaven is vast and boundless,
The Great Origin without form or shape.
Vacuous and quiescent, unseen,
Its frame dissolves into dissolution.
Errors lose the thread of affairs,
Words rebound to self-defeat.
This sequence of the four phases
Illumines the blind of later generations.

This passage speaks of the four phases merging and returning to the Ultimateless, directly revealing the supreme and most authentic Dao. People know only the *postcelestial* four phases but not the *precelestial* four phases. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the postcelestial four phases. When these four return to chaos and revert to emptiness, this is the precelestial four phases. The postcelestial four phases have form and name, and their words can be exhausted; they are precisely what is called *"branches, stems, flowers, and leaves."* The precelestial four phases are formless and nameless, and their words cannot be exhausted; they are precisely what is called *"the rootstock."* The *Cantong Qi* expounds Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li throughout, nearly exhausting their meaning. Master Wei feared that people might ascend the branches and forget the root, so at the end of the work, he specially revealed to them the wordless words and imageless intent, continuing from the previous chapter’s *"residing in the rootstock, not losing its simplicity."*

In the world, all grasses and trees grow branches and stems in early spring, spread flowers and leaves in midsummer, and bear fruit in autumn. Though these three are present, they have not yet returned to the root. Only when the midwinter season arrives, when Heaven and Earth are closed and sealed, and the bitter cold congeals, do all branches, stems, flowers, and fruits fall away without remainder, leaving only the rootstock. In creation-and-transformation, this is the convergence of hidden potential; in our bodies, it is the time of returning to the root and restoring life. Thus it is said: *"Like the Midwinter Season, grasses and trees all wither and break."*

At the first stirring of the solitary Yang, the myriad things have not yet arisen. Though it moves, it has not departed from stillness—this is what Shaozi called *"the supreme marvel between one movement and one stillness, the marvel of Heaven, Earth, and humanity."* At this moment, the heart of Heaven and Earth is deeply concealed in the ninefold abyss, its mechanism secure and tight. What is within does not emerge; what is without does not enter—this is the image of *"the solstice closing the passes, merchants and travelers not moving, the latter not inquiring of the directions."* Thus it is said: *"Assisting Yang, it questions merchants and travelers; the lord of men deeply conceals himself."* Merchants and travelers, rushing about in movement, are a metaphor for the activation of the ears and eyes. The lord of men, composed and inactive, is a metaphor for the True Person’s retreat and concealment. The True Person, abiding in the deep abyss, neither emerges nor enters, all restless seeking thoughts forever stilled and never arising again—like merchants and travelers, questioned and thus not daring to proceed. The image of closing the passes corresponds to the winter solstice, though moving, not departing from stillness, following the season’s natural decree. At this time, one should only seal the *dui* and embrace the One, guarding the center. How could one violate the prohibition against excessive speech and the exhaustion of words? Thus it is said: *"Emulating the season, following its decree, seal the mouth, refrain from speech."*

The great Way of the Golden Elixir shares the same creative transformation as the Way of Heaven. The Way of Heaven has *yuan, heng, li,* and *zhen,* cycling endlessly, vast and profound, beyond exhaustive inquiry. *Yuan* and *heng* govern generation and growth, the outward mechanism of creation-and-transformation, what is called *"manifesting through benevolence."* *Li* and *zhen* govern return and concealment, the inward mechanism of creation-and-transformation, what is called *"concealing in function."* At the time of return and concealment, above there is no longer color, below there is no longer abyss. Meeting it, there is no head; following it, there is no tail—this is what is called *"the Primordial Darkness, difficult to fathom, impossible to depict."* Thus it is said: *"The Way of Heaven is vast and boundless, the Great Origin without form or shape."*

Heaven and Earth are the true womb of the Great Void; the sun and moon are the true breath of the Great Void. At the midwinter season, at the juncture of *hai* and *zi,* Heaven and Earth unite in essence, and the sun and moon hold fast. The true breath of the sun and moon is concealed within the true womb of Heaven and Earth—unseen, unheard. The turning mechanism halts, returning to chaos. At this moment, there is no Heaven, no Earth, no sun, no moon, no gates of Qian and Kun, no frame of Kan and Li. All dissolve into a single expanse of the Great Void—this is true emptiness, this is wondrous being, this is the *Yi* before Fu Xi drew it, this is the nameless Dao of Laozi, this is *"what Heaven bears, without sound or scent,"* this is the original face before the arising of sound.

Thus it is said: *"The void and quiescence cannot be beheld; the frame and bounds have dissolved and vanished."*

Within chaos, Heaven and Earth are but Qian and Kun; within chaos, the sun and moon are but Kan and Li. The formless form is the true form; the wordless word is the ultimate word. Those with clear vision may from this contemplate the precelestial *Xin Yi*—indeed, they may dispense with all images and spare all words!

Yet this Dao is such that only those of the highest faculties and keenest instruments grasp it upon contact. The rest, of middling and lesser capacities, know only the *Yi* of forms—how could they know the *Yi* without form? They know only Qian and Kun, Kan and Li with shape and name—how could they know Qian and Kun, Kan and Li without shape or name?

If one were to remain silent and say nothing, one might well risk obscurity and carelessness, leaving distinctions unclear and functions unexplored, causing later learners to fall into all manner of errors—what evidence would they have? Yet if one were to recklessly invent extraneous details, one might only pile heads upon heads, mount donkeys to seek donkeys, leading later learners into all manner of forced interpretations, inevitably harming their very roots.

Thus it is said: *"Errors lose the thread of affairs; words return to self-defeat."*

After repeated reflection, I could do no other than divide this work into three sections, each further divided into chapters, distinguishing and ordering them thus: this is the Gate of Qian and Kun; this is the Frame of Kan and Li; this is the Crucible and Cauldron of Qian and Kun; this is the Medicinal Substance of Kan and Li—these are what is meant by the *Xing* and *Qing* of the Great *Yi*.

When these are brought together and penetrated, then what the Yellow Emperor and Laozi nurtured is none other than this Qian and Kun, Kan and Li; what the furnace fire refines is none other than this Qian and Kun, Kan and Li. All this is but pointing the way for the blind, expending every effort in circumlocution. Yet if one were speaking to those with clear eyes, there would be no need for such manifold distinctions!

Thus it is said: *"Distinguish and order these Four Images to enlighten later generations of the blind."* Since it is called the Four Images, it is no longer the root and trunk! Since it is called "distinguish and order," it is already the root and trunk broken into branches, stems, flowers, and leaves. How could it compare to the supreme subtlety of the undifferentiated, wordless state?

This chapter contains the final earnest admonitions of the *Cantong Qi*, of utmost importance, yet rife with errors through the ages—it cannot but be clarified. Chen Xianwei’s annotated edition moves this passage before the "Taiyang’s Flowing Pearl" chapter, where "the *zi* turns right, the *wu* rotates east," linking the *zi-wu-mao-you* to the Four Images. Yu Yuwu’s edition relocates it beneath the "Confucius Praises Hongmeng" chapter, where "the yang *qi* fades and hides," connecting the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six to the Four Images. Little do they realize that *zi-wu-mao-you* and seven, eight, nine, six all belong to the postcelestial Four Images of form and name—what relevance do they have to the profound concealment, the vanishing of the frame?

Chen Guanwu’s edition comes closest to the correct order, yet it mistakenly merges this with the preceding chapter on the *Xing* and *Qing* of the Great *Yi*. The earlier chapter clearly speaks of the Three Ways, while this one clearly speaks of the Four Images. Though the text flows continuously, their meanings are entirely distinct—how can they be conflated? If these scholars have not yet grasped the meaning of the words and sentences, how can they claim to have attained the author’s intent?

Throughout the *Cantong Qi*, there is no passage that does not elucidate the Four Images. Yet the Four Images, being of form and name, have already fallen to the second level of meaning. Fearing that later learners might pluck the branches and leaves while forgetting the root, the primordial *Xin-Yi* would nearly be extinguished! Thus, in his final words, Master Wei directly points to the undifferentiated, returning to the supreme, single vehicle of the Dao. For by tracing the Four Images back to the Two Modes, the Two Modes back to the Supreme Ultimate, and the Supreme Ultimate back to the Non-Ultimate—whether called the Great Origin, emptiness and quiescence, profound concealment, or the vanishing of the frame—all these expressions, appearing in layers, ultimately reveal the return to the root and restoration to the origin, the subtle workings prior to birth.

When one grasps this subtle working, one realizes that before the brush touched the page, a complete *Cantong Qi* already existed throughout heaven and earth, in the Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, manifest everywhere. Open your eyes and you see it; close your eyes and it is still not unseen. Incline your ear and you hear it; cover your ears and it is still not unheard. This is what the *Daode Jing* means by *"There is a thing, undifferentiated, born before heaven and earth"*; what the *Xici Zhuan* means by *"The spirit has no direction, the *Yi* has no form"*; what Master Shao means by *"Before the first stroke, the *Yi* was already there"*; what Master Zhou means by *"The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Non-Ultimate."*

Nor is this all. Confucius devoted his life to editing, revising, and expounding, yet he said, *"I wish to speak no more—what does Heaven say?"* Is this not the principle that *"words return to self-defeat"*? Śākyamuni taught for forty-nine years, yet claimed *"I have not spoken a single word,"* and in the end transmitted only the wordless gong’an of the flower held aloft. Is this not the meaning of *"keeping silent and not speaking"*? Why then doubt the *Cantong Qi*?

The patriarch composed this work and established these images to enlighten later generations of the blind. Yet for over fourteen or fifteen hundred years, though the book has been transmitted, the blind remain as they were. Some falsely invoke the yin and yang of the Great *Yi* to practice sexual arts; others mistake the nurturing of *xing* in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for solitary cultivation; still others misconstrue the furnace fire’s sublimation of elixirs as mere alchemy. The blind leading the blind, they plunge together into the fire pit. Even if they encounter a true teacher’s guidance, they remain stubbornly unconvinced. How lamentable!

In his final words, the patriarch, with earnest concern, sought to seal his tongue and forget speech, for he foresaw the many blind men of later ages. These are the *Cantong Qi*’s ultimate, all-encompassing lines—who would dare reveal them to this extent? Truly, *"Heaven does not begrudge the Dao!"* Reader, bring your single eye—lest you pass through in vain.

**Postface to the Opening Chapter, Chapter Thirty-Six**

A rustic from the state of Kuai,
A withered scholar from a secluded valley.
Clinging to plainness and simplicity,
I take no joy in power or glory.
Dwelling in obscurity and remoteness,
I disregard profit and fame.
Holding fast to tranquility and indifference,
I seek peace in my time.
At ease in leisure,
I composed this text.
Singing of the Great *Yi*,
I transmit the words of the Three Sages.
Examining their purport,
I find a single thread running through all.
My aim is to follow principle,
To illuminate the spirit.
Let the numinous transformation flow freely,
Bringing peace to the four seas.
I set it forth as a calendar,
For ten thousand generations to follow.
Use it to govern,
And its practice will be effortless.
Draw from it to nurture *xing* within,
In the natural way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Abiding in profound virtue,
Return to the root and restore the origin.
It is near in my heart,
Not apart from this body.
Embrace the One and never let go—
Thus may you endure forever.
Pair it with the sublimation of elixirs,
Arranging the feminine and masculine.
Discard the martial cinnabar of Wudu,
Abandon the eight minerals.
Discern their use to perfect things,
Though the world may prize them.
I array three methods,
Their branches and stems interconnected.
Though they emerge differently named,
All proceed from a single gate.
Not merely piling up phrases,
I harmonize this text in parallel.
There is indeed truth here,
Like pebbles that may yet be admired.
If I were to fabricate falsehoods,
I would only incur superfluous blame.
Thus I name it *Cantong Qi*.
Glancing at its beginning,
The words are few, the Dao vast—
Later generations should revere it.

Entrusting the times to shed harm,
I take refuge in hills and mountains.
Wandering the vast and boundless,
I dwell as neighbor to spirits.
Transforming form to ascend as immortal,
I sink into silence without sound.
A hundred generations hence,
I roam among men.

Spreading wings to the east and west,
To the south and the verge of north,
Tang met with dire straits,
Water and drought kept apart and conjoined.
Branches and leaves withered yellow,
Losing their flourishing splendor.
The fortunate ride upon blessings,
Abiding in peace, attaining long life.

This chapter recounts Wei Gong’s intent in composing this work,
Concealing his name to await later ages.

A rustic from the humble state of Kuai,
A withered life in a secluded valley,
I cling to plainness and simplicity,
Unmoved by power or glory.
Dwelling in obscurity and remoteness,
I disregard profit and fame.
Holding fast to tranquility,
I long for the peace of the times.
At ease in leisurely seclusion,
I compose this text.

This passage speaks of Wei Gong’s intent in secluding himself to write.

According to the *Liexian Zhuan*: "The Perfected One, Wei Boyang, was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. Though his family had long worn the cap and sash of office, he alone did not serve, cultivating the true and dwelling in silence. Nurturing his will in emptiness and non-being, he was broadly learned in literature and versed in the weft and warp of prophecy. Serene and plain, he followed only the Dao, regarding the trappings of rank as chaff and husks. From the Perfected Yin Changsheng, he received the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. Following its method, he refined and attained perfection, then drew upon the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters."

This autobiographical passage closely mirrors the account in the tradition, and thus may be considered a faithful record. Though Wei Gong was originally from Kuaiji, his reference to the ancient state of Kuai was likely a veiled allusion.

The *Song* expounds the *Great Change*,
The legacy of the Three Sages.
Examining its purport,
All is discussed in unity.
The task lies in aligning with principle,
Radiating the spirit.
Spiritual transformation flows unimpeded,
Bringing peace to the four seas.
Marking it as a calendar,
It may be followed for ten thousand generations.
Ordering it to govern,
Its practice is effortless.

This passage states that the *Cantong Qi* is fundamentally rooted in the *Great Change*, embodying the principle of governance. The *Change* passed through three sages—its trigrams, appended judgments, and *Wings*—all aimed at revealing the work of exhausting one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny. Wei Gong, discerning its essential purport, externally aligned with the transformations of creation and internally mirrored the mind and body. Summarizing and examining it, all proceeds from the twofold use of Kan and Li. Its essence is nature and destiny; its function is spirit. When the principle of nature and destiny is aligned, the function of spirit is complete. Thus it is said: "The task lies in aligning with principle, radiating the spirit." To fathom the spirit and know transformation is the wonder of the *Change*. By the One, there is spirit; by the Two, there is transformation. Applying this to cultivate the mind, spirit and transformation are stored in the Central Yellow, yielding the proof of universal principle. Applying this to govern the world, spirit and transformation spread across the four seas, manifesting the achievement of peace. Thus it is said: "Spiritual transformation flows unimpeded, bringing peace to the four seas." Zi to the south and Wu to the north serve as the warp and woof; establishing Wei at Mao and You, the jade armillary turns in cycles—this is the origin of the calendar. Thus it is said: "Marking it as a calendar, it may be followed for ten thousand generations." The lord practices non-action; the minister, action. When the Bright Hall enacts governance, the state suffers no harm to the Dao—this is the standard for ruling the world. Thus it is said: "Ordering it to govern, its practice is effortless." The Dao of the *Change* is the Dao of governance; the Dao of governance is the Dao of the Elixir. Inner sageliness and outer kingship are threaded as one. This passage specifically concludes the guiding principle of governance, which is what is meant by "the nature and feelings of the *Great Change*, each in accord with its measure."

Drawing inward to nurture nature,
Following the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Abundant in virtue and power,
Returning to the root, reverting to the origin.
It is near in my heart,
Not apart from this body.
Embrace the One and never let go—
Thus may you endure forever.

This passage speaks of the principle of nurturing nature through naturalness. Externally, the Dao of purity and non-action derives from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Internally, within the nine palaces of the human body lies the cinnabar gate of the Yellow Court, governed by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi of the Center, harboring the ancestral nature—heavenly and true, naturally so. What is called nurturing nature is simply nurturing this. Thus it is said: "Drawing inward to nurture nature, following the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi." The ancestral nature is the supreme virtue. Originally, it is neither lost nor gained, neither diminished nor increased. If the practitioner thoroughly understands this nature, they may immediately return to the root and revert to destiny, reverting to the origin. Thus it is said: "Abundant in virtue and power, returning to the root, reverting to the origin." The ancestral nature is originally one body, but when divided into two uses, it pertains to the two entities of body and mind. Yet the mind is not the fleshly heart but the true emptiness within original wondrous being; the body is not the four great elements but the wondrous being within original true emptiness. These two are possessed by all, and all cultivation and realization do not depart from this very substance. Thus it is said: "It is near in my heart, not apart from this body." The ancestral aperture is the true center. When the two families of body and mind return to the ancestral aperture, this is the true One. If one can guard the center and embrace the One without ceasing for even a moment, the Dao of long life and enduring vision is attained. Thus it is said: "Embrace the One and never let go—thus may you endure forever." This passage specifically concludes the guiding principle of nurturing nature, which is what is meant by "the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s thorough investigation, refined and governable."

Pair it with the sublimation of elixirs,
Arranging the feminine and masculine.
Discard the martial cinnabar of Wudu,
Abandon the eight minerals.
Discern their use to perfect things,
Though the world may prize them.

This passage speaks of the principle of furnace and fire in the sublimation of elixirs. Internally, it is the Great Dao of true nature and true destiny, the one yin and one yang. Externally, it is likened to true lead and true mercury, the two entities of one feminine and one masculine. In terms of the restraint of hun and po, it is called subduing with dragon and tiger; in terms of mutual absorption, it is called ingestion—this is the work of the golden liquid returning elixir, far removed from the so-called ingestion of side paths. Thus it is said: "Pair it with the sublimation of elixirs, arranging the feminine and masculine." When the world hears of furnace and fire, they invariably assume it refers to the five metals and eight minerals; when they hear of feminine and masculine, they invariably take it to mean orpiment and realgar. Yet these are all post-heaven dregs of form and substance, discarded and unused by the perfected.

Thus it is said: *"Cast aside the ores of Wudu, discard the eight minerals."* Having discarded them, why then pair them with the practice of ingestion? It is simply that the arts of smelting lead to dry mercury and transmuting copper into gold have long existed—worldly men prize such techniques but not the Dao. They invariably hold these in the highest esteem. The patriarchs, having repeatedly weighed this, knew that what the world most treasures are the substances of alchemy. Thus they borrowed the false to reveal the true, embedding the wondrous workings of the golden elixir and ingestion within allegory, so that many would believe and follow. Hence it is said: *"Carefully employ what the world holds dear."*

Wudu lies thousands of *li* west of Liangzhou, yielding orpiment and realgar. The Master Wei states that his *"arrangement of the feminine and masculine"* does not refer to the minerals produced in Wudu. The *Awakening to Reality* says, *"Cease refining the three yellows and four spirits,"* which conveys the same meaning. This passage specifically elucidates the function of ingestion—what is called *"the work of the furnace and fire, grounded in truth."*

Three principles are arrayed, their branches and stems interconnected. Though bearing different names, they emerge from a single gate. These are not mere accumulations of phrases, nor rhymed couplets for literary effect. Rather, they contain profound truth, like a vein of jade hidden in rough stone—once unearthed, its brilliance is revealed. Should I expound falsehoods, I would only incur superfluous faults.

This book is titled *The Kinship of the Three*—precisely because the three teachings intermingle, all issuing from one gate, thereby uniting with the supreme and perfect Dao. If scholars trace its origins, they will see that though its words are few, its Way is vast, encompassing the full path of fulfilling one’s nature and destiny. How could later disciples fail to uphold it? This section particularly reveals the meaning behind the title *The Kinship of the Three*—that *"three Ways arise from one, all following the same path."*

Abandoning the times to avoid harm, I take refuge in the mountains. Roaming the boundless expanse, I dwell among ghosts. Transforming my form into immortality, I sink into silence. A hundred generations hence, I wander among men. Spreading my feathered wings, I traverse east, west, south. In Tang’s time of peril, floods and droughts divided the land. The leaves of the catalpa wither and yellow, losing their splendor. The virtuous ride upon their burdens, secure in everlasting life.

This final passage conceals the author’s name within the text, awaiting discovery by later ages. The sixteen lines, when combined, reveal the immortal’s name: The first four—*"Abandoning the times to avoid harm, I take refuge in the mountains. Roaming the boundless expanse, I dwell among ghosts"*—form the character *Wei* 魏. The next four—*"Transforming my form into immortality, I sink into silence. A hundred generations hence, I wander among men"*—form *Bo* 伯. The following four—*"Spreading my feathered wings, I traverse east, west, south. In Tang’s time of peril, floods and droughts divided the land"*—form *Yang* 阳. The last four—*"The leaves of the catalpa wither and yellow, losing their splendor. The virtuous ride upon their burdens, secure in everlasting life"*—form *Zao* 造. Thus, the entire *Kinship of the Three* was composed by Wei Boyang.

The immortal was a recluse who did not wish to attach his name to the work, yet neither did he desire complete obscurity. Thus he wove ambiguous phrases and hidden allusions, half-concealing and half-revealing, so that later generations might come to know him. This mirrors how the root of a single truth lies concealed within the branches of the three chapters, subtly emerging to await the enlightenment of future readers.

The immortal’s concealment of his name echoes the earlier admonition: *"Seal your lips and speak not of it."* Those who grasp its meaning may encounter it at dawn or dusk, though they may miss it in passing. The first chapter’s closing lines—*"I dare not speak falsely, emulating the sages’ writings"*—and the middle chapter’s—*"I grieve deeply and thus record these words"*—both express the intent to leave teachings for posterity. Yet the meaning remains incomplete until the final chapter, where the author’s purpose is clarified: elucidating how the three Ways arise from one, making *The Kinship of the Three* a bridge between the sages of old and later worthies, a standard for exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and realizing destiny.

Thus this chapter not only unites the three correspondences but indeed serves as the summation of the entire work. *The Kinship of the Three* is a text most difficult to read, for at its outset, one line is divided into three chapters, and in the end, three chapters are fused into a single line—yet the line itself is no line at all. Within this division and fusion, wondrous transformations unfold; even one with the eyes of Li Zhu would seldom avoid dizziness, nor one with the ears of Shi Kuang escape deafness. Now, with my teacher’s full revelation of its hidden depths, it is as though a lamp illuminates a chamber dark for a thousand years. Is this not the compass of Fuxi’s *Changes*, the torch of wisdom for *The Kinship of the Three*?
