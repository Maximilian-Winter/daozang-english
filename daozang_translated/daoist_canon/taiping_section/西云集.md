**Mountain Dwelling – Thirteen Poems**

Shaking off the bonds of fame and profit’s prison,
I return to hide my traces in old forests and hills.
When weary, I sit or lie beneath towering pines,
Brushing clean the mossy mat to pillow on stone.

Harmonious *qi* suffuses the grotto-heaven,
Nurturing numinous essence as my practice ripens.
Drunk and drowsing beneath green cliffs, I hear birdsong—
It calls forth the scripture of long life and enduring vision.

Stolidly forgetting schemes, I escape the world’s cage,
Drifting like cloud and water, east or west as I please.
Drunk, I lean on a pillow in the pine’s shade—
Who plays the reed pipes filling the vast sky?

A solitary wisp of cloud wanders idly,
The twin wheels of sun and moon follow their course.
If a Daoist’s skill could be thus,
I would bury my name among the jade peaks.

A stream of green water winds round the brushwood fence,
On all sides, blue mountains array their emerald slopes.
No carriages or horses pass my gate—
Only wild clouds return now and then to the grotto.

The mountain hall sees no visitors all day,
In the still night, tigers sometimes knock at the door.
With mind and nature serene in this single retreat,
Harmonious *qi* ascends to Kunlun’s heights.

Before the jade peaks, I keep tryst with a friend,
Delighted, we talk and laugh, forgetting the hour.
No red-dust world meets my eyes—
Only white clouds atop my head, mirroring the moon’s glow.

Woods and springs nurture my clumsiness, worldly ties fade,
My heart-mind untainted, the immortal’s joy is fine.
Strolling at ease among mountains and waters,
I return to pillow high on mist and rosy clouds.

On a still night, I wander amid mountain hues,
Leaping into empty space, hands flung wide in purple clouds.
On wondrous peaks, gibbons cry to the moon;
By limpid shallows, tigers roar in the wind.

For a decade, I’ve hidden among jade peaks,
Free and at ease within five-colored clouds.
Beyond the world of men, none know me—
North or south, east or west, I come and go as I will.

Weary of the dusty world, I delight in natural truth,
Beyond things, I wander carefree, my body unbound.
Deep in azure mists, no companions—
Only the high mountain’s flowing waters as my neighbor.

Few walk the mystic gate, yet I’ve not stood out,
Finding a hidden place, I hide myself away.
I seek no worldly glory or noble rank—
I wish only to be a guardian of clumsiness in woods and springs.

The grotto-heaven’s wind and moon, water and clouds,
Magic mushrooms bloom, lotuses open, jade nectar mellows.
Last night, a blue-robed messenger brought sacred words—
All were entrusted to this idle man.

**Expressing Aspirations – Fifty Poems**

Why would I tire of visitors to my study?
I fear they bring in right and wrong.
If we contend over right and wrong,
We lose true leisure and true joy.

In youth, I severed the web of attachments,
Returning to reflect and dwell in the Old Master’s house.
Carefree among water and clouds, I make my living,
My life a path of poverty, softness, and weakness.

Thoughts are like bubbles on water,
Reflecting light to dispel their traces.
If one knows this principle of practice,
Harmonious *qi* flows through the body of its own.

I envy not the lord of ten thousand households,
Forgetting name and abandoning profit, I have no cares.
When hungry, I beg at doors as fate allows;
When full, I return to my hut to study the butcher’s art.

My heart-mind untainted, I escape the world’s cage,
Forgetting words, I grasp the meaning—original emptiness.
Green mountains hold stones flat as pillows—
I gladly become the world’s sleepy old man.

Seeing through the vanity of profit and fame,
I perfect my nature and life, my practice complete.
The clamor of clouds’ proud echoes fills my ears—
Riding a crane, I roam spiritually to the Jade Capital.

My eyes grow weary in the dusty world’s bustle,
Everywhere I turn, no emotions entangle my nature.
Clouds part, the blue sky reveals autumn’s bright moon—
Staff in hand, I step alone onto the Jasper Terrace.

A carefree immortal, drifting at ease,
When weary, I pillow high on clouds to sleep.
In dreams, not a speck of dust soils me—
I transform into golden light filling the cosmos.

I push aside all subtle mechanisms,
Laying down the whole body to enter non-action.
Responding to things with true emptiness—
This is when a man awakens.

Once the One Real is fully realized, all entanglements cease,
No more wasted time chasing desires.
*Qi* full, essence abundant, merit and practice complete,
I ride a whale to return to Yingzhou.

Laying down the whole body, the Dao becomes intimate,
My heart ashen, no longer stained by the mundane.
Numinous light above and below connects heaven and earth—
A free man, I roam north, south, east, or west.

Death within death, death within death,
Ending, then ending again, ending without end.
Three or five times, the crane’s summons arrives—
Riding a phoenix, I soar through the nine skies.

Sword in hand, I battle demon armies,
Vanquishing demon armies to become a Daoist follower.
Steadily riding a white ox through grotto-palaces,
An idle man who seems not idle at all.

My celestial skills are beyond mortal measure,
My otherworldly mechanisms unknown even to ghosts.
Returning from audience in the Flowery Canopy’s halls,
I adjust my rainbow robes to feast at Jasper Pool.

Heart ashen, form withered, I lay down the sword,
Bones and flesh all ascend to Great Luo.
Looking down on the dusty world’s carriages and horses,
They toil daily for paltry fame and profit.

Beyond things, forgetting schemes, I match the sages’ art,
Breaking through Heaven’s Gate to attend Jasper Pool.
Who understands the flute played without holes?
The zither plucked without strings is known only to me.

In every encounter, the heart rests, shedding all demons,
Forgetting words, grasping meaning, I lay down the sword.
The world’s endless turns hold no end—
Only in my hut do I nurture supreme harmony.

Poverty and softness make true cultivation,
Fame and profit’s vanities are all abandoned.
The heart-ground clear, nothing else remains—
Only pure wind and bright moon fill the jade tower.

Practice suddenly awakens, cutting off dust,
Dispersing deluded clouds, the moon of nature shines.
Forging and refining primordial chaos, it returns to my chamber—
Without moving a step, I arrive at Penglai.

Pure light gleams, free of the slightest dust,
Vast *qi* flows endlessly, nurturing the Valley Spirit.
The man of affairs is not like the man of no affairs—
I envy not the man of intentions.

Harmonious *qi* suffuses the nine realms,
The Azure Dragon steadily carries me from the Ten Isles.
In the Hall of Luminous Clarity, reed pipes play—
Drinking fine wine, what joy!

Last night, a mad Daoist rode a dragon,
Coming especially to speak with me of the mystic wind.
The elixir complete, its light waxes and wanes—
Yet it still lacks the world’s pure and tranquil merit.

Everywhere, I see through the original nothingness,
Vast, vast pure wind fills the great void.
Recognizing the true face within—
I take this body as a temporary hut.

Suddenly I shed the clamor and sever worldly passions,
Forgetting schemes, forgetting things—even forgetting form.
Spirit congealed, *qi* knotted, the infant is complete—
Freely I release and gather, entering the profound obscurity.

Mind forgets all realms, emerging from the river of delusion,
Intent does not sink into emptiness—Daoist practice flourishes.
Clouds disperse, the azure pool gleams pure and bright,
Luminous light unwavering, *qi* and spirit harmonized.

Bamboo desk, rush mat, a humble thatched hall—
Carefree, without affairs, I conceal my radiance.
From now on, I no longer idly chant verses,
To spare others the talk of my shortcomings.

The red dust’s dream breaks—joy knows no end,
Responding to things without arising, I gain freedom.
Spirit and *qi* in harmony, merits complete,
The azure simurgh steadily carries me to Yingzhou.

From awakening, the perfect truth holds not a coin,
Not a coin possessed—this is the perfect truth.
Strange how a tattered quilt warms three winters,
For I share half the spring from the pot’s within.

When will envy, stinginess, greed cease?
When will *qi*, wealth, wine, and lust come to rest?
Turning my head, I suddenly awaken—all cast aside,
Letting go, I return to utter freedom.

A hundred years of light—forty already passed,
Not a single accomplishment, temples now grizzled.
Last night, my heart suddenly awakened,
Dwelling in a humble hut, nurturing serenity.

Reciting the *Scripture of Ninefold Cyclical Elixir*,
A decade of drunken dreams startled awake in an instant.
No mind to vie for prominence in the world,
Intent only to hide my name among the mountains.

I’ve wandered north and south, east and west,
Clouds and waters—my conduct nearly sufficient.
The world’s livelihood is but clamor,
The immortals’ way is naturally subtle.

Sitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—
Advancing forward, I enter the land of immortals.
How can the land of immortals be shown to others?
When yin is exhausted and yang complete, the Dao manifests itself.

Sitting in stillness, forgetting words, I reflect—
Advancing forward, I step beyond the dusty frontier.
The cinnabar field holds a treasure beyond life and death,
The square inch without emotion—this is the land of the Dao.

Suddenly severing worldly ties, I yearn for immortal cultivation,
Nature and life merge, attaining spontaneity.
Confronting realms, the mind turns to ash—one without affairs,
In the grotto, high-pillowed, I sleep amidst clouds.

Dualities of good and evil arise without cause,
A single dust-like thought refuses to cease.
Risking death for a decade, battling strife,
At last, I stride alone through the great void.

Dwelling in green peaks, my heart’s delight unfurls,
Reclining amidst clouds and mist—what joy!
Suddenly, my mind and intent leave the mortal world,
The divine mechanism awakens, and I swiftly return.

Green waters, blue mountains—without a speck of dust,
Yet still I seek Penglai in the places I attain.
Though my thatched hut is humble,
Who without merit could ever arrive here?

Turning the light inward, I examine human sentiments,
Reflecting back, I observe the world’s heart.
When worldly sentiments and human passions are exhausted,
I may pillow my head high and sleep on jade peaks.

Not chasing wealth, guarding poverty and leisure—
Why should others cast cold eyes upon me?
With a flick of my sleeve, I return to the green peaks,
Soaring high, I recline atop white clouds.

Fame and fortune—all cast aside,
Worldly affairs and human sentiments—all abandoned.
Straight into the depths of clouded mountains I hide,
In my thatched study, I meticulously study the mysterious teachings.

Utterly clumsy, utterly still,
Pure poverty, pure leisure.
Deep in the golden pavilion mountains, no guests arrive,
A single censer of incense seals the brushwood gate.

Amidst a thicket of worries, worries grow distant,
Within a heap of right and wrong, right and wrong fade.
The divine mechanism silently grasps the principle of conduct,
Between heaven and earth—this is no falsehood.

Heaven and earth teem with tigers and dragons,
Wielding lightning, thundering—creation’s work.
The vast sky roams the carefree wanderer,
How could worldly people possess such a way?

Entering the mysterious gate for twenty years,
I’ve reined in my heart, not letting horse or monkey run wild.
Returning, I clap my hands and laugh before the cliffs—
The Milky Way was always the Milky Way.

Unkempt, grimy, appearing foolish and dull,
Yet within, luminous clarity never dims.
Only when the blue-robed messenger delivers good tidings,
Will you then believe the awakening to the mysterious mechanism.

Three seals on thoughts of self and others, right and wrong,
A single thought returning to the root—Daoist vision clears.
Henceforth, I depart the realm of cause and effect,
Singing alone, drinking alone—rejoicing in non-arising.

Like the arrival of impermanence’s limit,
How much better to cease before death.
Cease, cease, cease—until reaching the realm of non-action,
Only then do I exit the mundane stream and enter the Daoist flow.

Seizing the power of yin and yang’s creation,
I become an immortal of Peng Island’s grottoes.
Dragons lead me to slumber on mountain peaks,
Tigers draw me to sleep beneath the sea.

A single bell’s toll startles the dreaming soul,
Three cock’s crows—departing the imperial city.
Striding alone atop Kunlun’s summit,
I look down upon the floating world’s scramble for fame and gain.

*Leaving My Interests* – Five Poems

The divine sword, since hidden in its scabbard,
Demonic armies shriek—bones and hair turn cold.
I’ve wandered all ten directions of the world,
A single luminous clarity—peace wherever I touch.

Through kalpas, I’ve lost—today I awaken,
Examining every head—breaking free from the mortal prison.
Idly standing before the vast sea’s peaks,
I chance upon a divine raft sailing the heavens.

Girded sword, riding a dragon—mighty in bearing,
Soaring at will across the azure vault.
Passing three mountains by night—dawn still early,
I lodge at Jade Terrace’s foremost peak.

Mountains of uniform green rise into the blue sky,
A few calls of secluded birds in the setting sun.
Bird calls, mountain hues—none understand,
Only the awakened can penetrate creation’s workings.

Examining all ties, I exit the world,
In the depths of emerald cliffs—true leisure.
Lying down, I listen to the murmuring stream,
Gazing southwest—more mountains to behold.

*Occasional Verses* – Seven Poems

Seeing through human sentiments, worldly affairs as empty,
Like tumbleweed and floating clouds, I lodge at heaven’s edge.
Deep in chaotic mountains, I hide my thatched hut,
No longer displaying my illusory form before others.

Thoroughly versed in worldly affairs—they are not steadfast,
I retreat to forests and springs, nurturing vastness.
Only when the divine elixir completes its nine cycles,
Will I ride a black crane upside-down to the three heavens.

Not discussing heavenly or worldly mechanisms,
Among pines, I recline and watch white clouds drift.
If someone comes to ask about cultivation,
I smile and point to the cold, emerald western peak.

At the brink of realms, the mind empties itself,
Harmonious *qi* circulates, filling the merit of practice.
Inspired, I freely chant amidst green peaks,
Weary, I recline high amidst white clouds.

Mountains encircle the setting sun on all sides,
A stream’s sound winds around the thatched hall.
How laughable—worldly people’s hearts are too turbid,
Seeking Penglai’s estate upon the sea.

Clouded mountains rise on all four sides into the vault of heaven,
At their center—a luminous grotto, the Daoist’s hall.

Amidst late spring’s third month, how fine—
Fallen blossoms strewn, their fragrance flowing with the stream.
Golden Pavilion Mountain harbors a grotto-heaven,
Since ancient times drawing recluses, sages beyond the dust.

A stream of cloud and water encircles emerald peaks,
Ten thousand acres of mist and rosy clouds seal jade summits.
Two idle chants:

Moment by moment, awakening to the Profound Mystery,
In every thing, at every turn, the Original Source appears.
Silence holds unfathomable mechanism,
Non-doing enacts principles beyond words.

Heart’s truth speaks not of worldly schemes,
At ease, I chant verses that capture the moment’s joy.
Having affairs—how can it compare to affairless days?
Non-doing surpasses the times of striving.

Two playful verses:

Beneath the pavilion, evergreen pines endure four seasons,
By their side, silent upon the mossy carpet I stand.
Last night, walking along the river embankment,
Willow fluff follows the wind, brushing against me.

Warmth, coolness, cold, heat—four seasons at peace,
Sweet, bitter, pungent, sour—one taste savored.
Though right and wrong enter the ear,
Neither honor nor disgrace touches the heart.

*Western Clouds Collection*, Volume One concludes
*Western Clouds Collection*, Volume Two
Composed by Master Luminous Grotto
Valley Spirit

Beyond things, I forget schemes and stand at ease,
In nothingness, I recognize the original truth.
From Heaven’s Gate surges forth a return to Peng Isle—
This family tradition is called Valley Spirit.

*Dead Heart*, Two Verses

How to still the stirrings of the crowd’s thoughts?
Tracing back, all thoughts arise from the heart alone.
If my heart can die before this life ends,
The Dao of enriching the state and pacifying the people naturally fulfills.

What proof sustains the work of cultivating truth?
When the heart dies, the crowd’s thoughts cease to stir.
Qi brims over, merits and deeds complete—
Spirit-light illumines the divine capital.

*Awakening to the Dao*, Four Verses

The master’s secret words open the heart to awakening,
The family tradition beyond things is nurtured within the world.
Though I traverse the world seeking, I cannot find it—
How could a crow bring it from amidst the flowers?

Forgetting schemes, I sit in blankness and awaken to the true constant,
The dharma-nature shines resplendent, filling the great square.
Lead and mercury, two kinds, gathered within the crucible,
Smelted into a single sheet of crystal light.

Immortals are originally cultivated by humans,
Cut off thoughts, forget form, and escape the prison of the world.
Awakening thoroughly to the bean’s first moment—no image, no thing—
Without leaving the hermitage gate, one arrives at Yingzhou.

The master’s secret words awaken the original beginning,
Coming with no lack, going with no excess.
Years of dust and grime are wiped and polished clean—
The whole body shines with numinous clarity, illuminating the great void.

*Clouds and Waters*

Leaping from the cage of the mundane, transgressions left behind,
Drifting clouds and flowing waters—what fine karmic conditions.
Green sand covers the ground beneath the pines’ shade,
Idly keeping company with a recluse, drunk and asleep.

*Admonitions to the Assembly*, Twenty Verses

Sight and sound forgotten, the heart-ground grows still,
Joy and sorrow cut off, qi and spirit harmonize.

From the primal beginning, awakening thoroughly to no coming, no going—
Can you grasp this family’s tradition?
The heart must not hastily become a guest of the dustless realm;
Sudden awakening, repeated cultivation—cultivation upon cultivation.

The nature resembles the autumn moon in the distant sky,
Clear and void, its reflection flowing with the clouds.
Green temples now strewn with fresh white hair,
Yet petty fame and profit yield nothing.

What use are wealth and nobility in the end?
They cannot buy escape from the wheel of rebirth, nor life beyond death.
Where now are the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei?
Their illusory achievements all come to naught.

Would you follow the ancients like Zhang and Fan?
Come with me to grow old in the clouded niche.
Let all disputes be settled in non-contention,
Let self and others dissolve in the patience of endurance.

If you fully lay down body and mind,
Numinous radiance will illuminate the vast firmament.
Do not ensnare others with the profound and wondrous—
To my eyes, even the profound and wondrous are empty.

Empty all traces, then stoke the fire of progress;
Within the cinnabar furnace, it naturally glows red.
Day and night, you toil over fame and profit,
Morning and dusk, you tend to this illusory body.

Though you may wear purple sashes and golden seals of office,
How can they compare to the nameless, idle Daoist?
On the path of life and death, people mark the years,
On the road of rebirth, travelers count the passing seasons.

Pity those who waste body and mind,
Failing to learn the way of long life and enduring vision.
Do not mistake the illusory form for the constant body,
Nor speak of the profound as if it were profound again.

Within the imageless, fathom the true form;
In the wordless, awaken to the real meaning.
A true man leaves behind emotions and desires,
One who chases profit and fame is no great man.

The tangible form is but dung and dust,
The nameless, numinous essence is the original body.
Banish passions, eat plain fare, dispel yin demons,
Sleep little, keep the spirit clear, and qi will naturally harmonize.

In the twelve hours, no darkness or obscurity,
With three thousand merits complete, seek the misty peaks.
Every person has the share to become an immortal—
Only worldly ties bind them with bitter entanglement.

If you lay down all worldly ties,
You may step upon the clouds from level ground.
How laughable are those fellow Dao-seekers,
Mistaking the head for the shadow, taking it as the celestial truth.

If you do not understand the principle beyond words in cultivation,
You will ultimately fail to grasp the form beyond form.
The path ahead demands careful heed—
Tread with intent through the brambles.

Ten years of diligent practice will see the task complete,
And naturally, the ninefold elixir will be perfected.
Lead and mercury, the two, gathered in the crucible,
Melt into a single piece of crystal light.

Do not let this supreme scene slip from your heart—
Scholars should examine it closely and in detail.
Externally repel yin demons, internally fortify yang;
Beyond this method, there is no other method.

When pure yang is refined and yin demons are exhausted,
Nature and life may truly endure.
The four great elements of the mortal body do not last long—
After a hundred years, all scatter apart.

Only when the heart turns to ash do you awaken to the true empty body,
And the jade-like resonance fills the great expanse.
The wondrous principles of Qiu and Liu are hard for people to grasp,
The mechanisms of Tan and Ma are not transmitted in the world.

This family’s tradition is attained in purity and stillness—
Only then may the practitioner awaken to the profound mystery.

*Idle Thoughts*

Do not idly speculate, carefree one;
Let your hair down, loosen your robe, and nurture your Daoist talent.
Last night, in a dream, I returned to my celestial abode,
Where numinous light transformed and filled the jade terrace.

Shallow pools stir with turbid waves when the wind blows,
Deep abysses remain clear even when disturbed.
Shallow cultivation leaves the heart unsettled,
Deep practice in the Dao makes the nature easily understood.

*Three Admonitions to Master Liang on His Travels*

Sir, do not exhaust yourself in ceaseless toil—
What is the meaning of your daily cultivation?
When all good and evil are fully laid down,
The spirit naturally settles, and qi rises in harmony.

Know that good and evil are but illusory ties;
Without transcending them, how can one be wise?
Have you yet laid down body and mind?
Only then may you escape form and precede the Lord of Creation.

*To Master Liu*

If you truly aspire to be an immortal, sever all attachments;
Only when the nature is settled will you know life is complete.
This principle need not be sought outside—
Do not waste your straw sandals in vain.

**The Craftsman’s Work**

When the craftsman’s hand is fit for labor,
New fire in the furnace, old tongs and hammer.
Forged into a nameless thing—
Who else could resemble the true person so closely?

**Four Poems on My Feelings**

Drifting, drifting through this life,
Gain and loss unstartling, honor and disgrace light.
Who has pierced this truth?
Retreat when it’s time to withdraw, act when it’s time to engage.

By water, against mountains, I build a nest,
A thousand crops in my fields by the stream.
People laugh at my livelihood—
What other skill do I possess?

Avoiding the world, a lazy man with no tricks,
Clumsy and dull, too foolish for subtlety.
No need to speak of worldly affairs—
I’ve won peaceful sleep, my legs stretched free.

My family’s ways painted on the screen:
A lean vine, straw hat, light straw sandals.
I’ve wandered the world with no desire left—
Only the heart of a lone cloud, a wild crane.

**The Difficulty of Learning the Dao**

A thousand hearings, yet leaving home is hardest of all,
A hundred schemes seek leisure, but leisure never comes.
Vexed by worldly dust clinging to the heart’s machinery—
When may I return to lie among the clouds?

**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on Cultivation**

Do not toil over exhaustive study—I tell you plainly:
Cast off the bonds of fame to be a free person.
Dwell neither within nor without, nor in between—
The whole body, empty and void, is the Dharma-body.

**Answering a Daoist Friend’s Question on the Wondrous Teaching**

What of wondrous words and profound sayings?
Their secret is not so vast.
Lay down body and mind to be a carefree guest—
Unclouded spirit, qi harmonized naturally.

**A Daoist Friend Asks How to Transcend Yin and Yang, Creation and Transformation**

New transgressions cease, old ones dissolve,
With no new or old faults, spirit and qi align.
Refine the luminous pearl until it shines brilliantly—
Yin and yang, creation and transformation are transcended in that moment.

**Fellow Daoists Ask What Evidence Proves Cultivation**

What evidence proves the work of refining the true?
Pure conduct and steadfast practice reveal the path.
Observe those on the road of no-birth—
When realms are forgotten and the heart extinguished, Penglai is their home.

**A Friend Asks About Chang’an**

Each time you endure, you gain leisure,
When circumstances arise, do not interfere.
If others vex you but your heart remains unmoved—
This alone is Chang’an.

**Answering a Question on Longevity**

Where root and dust end, the realm is serene and still—
No one there knows death or life.
If you can walk this far,
The nameless, numinous essence fills the great void.

**Answering a Question on Refining Mercury and Lead**

Clouds drift upward to the mud-pill palace,
Form withered, heart ashen, nature spontaneous.
This alone is the art of refinement—
No need to exhaust debate on mercury and lead.

**To Yang Fuying**

The Yang family reveres the perfected ones,
Morning and evening, their incense and devotion are most earnest.
What they receive in this life was accumulated in past lives—
What they cultivate now becomes the cause for the next.

**To Master Li**

Sever desire, forget emotion, and the heart hollows itself,
Penglai is but a footstep away.
I urge you to guard this single coming—
Awaken fully to the primordial: is there even an "one"?

**Two Poems to Liu Boda**

The heart’s transformations are beyond measure,
The enlightened must understand the great constant.
If you fully lay down the whole body,
Vast and boundless, spirit and qi fill the heavens.

A clumsy verse sent to Pengcheng—
No scheme compares to guarding purity and clarity.
When inspired, I roam and chant among green peaks;
When weary, I recline high in the white-cloud capital.

**To Yang Quhua**

For ten years in the dusty world, I sought true worthies,
Only to meet an old immortal from Hongnong.
With both hands, he snapped the locks of fame and profit—
His whole body bathed in the realm of water and clouds.

**Two Poems to Lu Yantong**

Gazing down at the sacred turtle playing in dark waves,
I came to fish it from the river of delusion.
Alas, it would not take the fragrant bait—
Turning away, I returned empty-handed to the Great Veil.

Having cast off the bonds of fame, a talent beyond the dust,
I idly cast my line from the fishing platform.
The bait was thrown at night’s end, but the fish did not bite—
Instead, I was invited by wind and moon into the cave.

**To Master Su**

Rushing south and north through the red dust,
I laugh at those on the roads to Chang’an.
Better to plant grievances within the numinous storehouse—
How could it compare to joy and laughter in the celestial truth?

**Two Poems to Scholar Du**

An empty heart illuminates worldly affairs,
A full belly contains the patterns of creation.
Responding to things with a clear and pure eye—
Naturally, a numinous chapter appears behind your elbow.

Roam freely between heaven and earth,
Carefree and untrammeled through spring and autumn.
Though I have not attained the joy of longevity,
When realms vanish and the heart is forgotten, death brings no sorrow.

**To Wang Zheju**

A descendant of Taiyuan, single-minded in purpose,
His square inch of heart is dustless, his life and fate whole.
Widely guiding the deluded to escape the world’s net,
He follows in the footsteps of the ancestral masters.

**To Lu Yantong**

Breaking the shackles of love and affection with a single stroke,
Leaping free from the platform of right and wrong—
A wanderer amidst mist and clouds in the heart of wild mountains,
I await the knock upon the pine gate to swing it open.

**Two More Poems**

Lu Yantong harbors the intent to leave the household life,
Yet lacks the resolute heart to act.
The divine water of his cinnabar field has run dry,
His temples bald, teeth sparse, eyes diseased and dim.
He comes to the treasure mountain empty-handed,
Only to face hardship a few steps ahead.

Long have I known your heart:
Your lips speak of the profound Dao, yet your nature clings to desire.
Cast aside lustful passions to seek the profound Dao,
Then you may follow me to dwell on the emerald peaks.

**To Master Fu**

You have mastered the ways of gain and loss, glory and decay,
And returned to lodge your traces at Ju Yang Hermitage.
Beyond the world’s affairs, you shall not age,
Ever guiding the deluded as their compass true.

**Two Poems to Householders Pursuing the Dao**

From youth you cultivated immortality, escaping the world’s cage,
Yet still fail to recognize your original face.
To speak of the Dao while remaining at home—
How it would make Lord Pang and Master Xu laugh!

The mechanism of transcendence is hard to grasp amid desire,
Dwelling in the dust, one cannot aspire to the subtle and serene.
If mere words could bring about karmic fruit,
A painted cake would sate hunger—how could that suffice?

**To Yin Guo**

Tending the fire without straying from the furnace’s side,
Once the elixir is complete, you awaken to the profound mystery.
I beg you to seek the wondrous within the subtle,
Where the unshaken crucible and hammer are naturally so.

**A Friend Visits**

The world’s splendor and vanity are all unbearable,
I conceal my light and hide my tracks, reclining amidst mist and haze.
Were it not for a knowing friend coming to call,
Who else would visit this hermitage?

**Visiting a Friend**

Green waters and blue mountains as close neighbors,
Pure winds and bright moons to keep you company.
After eating when hunger is sated, with nothing left to do,
I stroll through the pines to pay my respects to an old friend.

**Responding to a Friend’s Poem Seeking the Elixir**

Let no thing enter your heart,
Wherever you turn, without attachment, your nature finds peace.
Guard well the treasure within your own body,
No need to seek the divine elixir elsewhere.

**Parting from a Friend**

A thatched hut by the water, beside a bamboo fence,
Where immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.
When shall we meet again after this parting?
Riding clouds to pay homage before the ancestral masters.

**Two Poems for Master Li**

Ask not how the practice of cultivation fares,
Once the demonic hordes are vanquished, the weapons fall still.
The celestial palace is not far—
A heart without dust is the Great Heavenly Net.

If you still yearn for talents beyond the world,
Sever all ties with the human realm, cutting off comings and goings.
Seek not the family style beyond appearances—
Within your square inch of heart, the jeweled terrace is clearly revealed.

**For a Birthday**

No need for the zhuangchun’s longevity to bestow upon the worthy,
I offer these humble words to convey to you:
Diligently guard your spirit and qi,
And the days and months within the gourd will naturally extend.

**For Prefect Liu’s Birthday**

A man of sincerity and simplicity, held in all men’s esteem,
His governance and writings are known throughout the world.
No need for mountain recluses to offer blessings—
The days and months within his gourd stretch on endlessly.

**In Memory of Master Fu**

Thirty years within the gates of the mysterious,
Yet his heart never leapt beyond the five phases.
Now, laying down this skin-bag, he departs,
Returning at last to the formless heaven beyond appearances.

**Song Lao’s Transcendence**

He saw through all karmic entanglements, and they gradually dissolved,
Forgetting the self, his qi and spirit harmonized in stillness.
Early on, he completed the work of longevity,
No longer seeking the quietude of the human world.

**Two Poems in Lu Yantong’s Rhyme**

Severing the reins of fame and profit from before,
The radiance of the spirit shines forth, filling the vast sky.
Only then does one know the excellence of the family style beyond the world—
No longer do dreams haunt the homeland of the soul.

Breaking the locks of gain, casting off the dust’s reins,
Clouds and waters lead him to study under the true Yang.
With immortals of the grotto-palace as companions,
He has already left behind the realm of life and death.

**Two Poems in Abbot Rang’s Rhyme**

The sickness of the self must be seen by the self,
In movement and stillness, walking, standing, sitting, or lying.
A thousand kinds of attachments—all severed,
No longer bound by the wheel of rebirth in the human world.

Green waters and blue mountains, ever pleasing to behold,
This body is entirely at ease, like drifting white clouds.
In leisure, there is still a hint of something—
Vaguely, the spirit wanders, inquiring of Penglai’s gardens.

**In Master Sun’s Rhyme**

A thatched hut by distant waters, beside a bamboo fence,
Where immortal friends dwell together, discoursing on the wondrous Dao.
Before the horse and monkey of the mind, the locks are firmly set,
Naturally, a numinous chapter appears behind your elbow.

*The Central Cloud Collection, Volume Two, Concludes*
*The Central Cloud Collection, Volume Three*

**By Master Dongming, in Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**

Only in purity does one perceive the realm beyond the dust,
Only in non-doing can one escape the催 of death and life.
All worldly affairs—cast them aside,
Laughing, point to the clouds and mountains and go home.

**Nine Poems by Grand Master Liu of Taiping, Requesting a Response in the Same Rhyme**

Day and night, I urge you: ponder deeply,
Sever all attachments to avoid calamity.
Turn the mysterious pass, break free from the world’s net,
Together return to Penglai Isle to pay homage to Chongyang.

In cultivation, there is no wondrous harmony or mystery,
Guard the One, forget form, cut all ties of love.
Facing circumstances with no mind—truly clear,
Ride a white deer backward into the Jade Heaven.

Ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky,
The heart rests, no need to discuss the wondrous or mysterious.
The spirit terrace, limpid and pure, is the body of true emptiness,
Responding to things like a mirror hung in space.

Where white clouds part, the blue sky appears,
When black mist withdraws, the moon of nature is full.
If one grasps this principle,
The wondrous, formless body becomes whole of itself.

The Way of Heaven waxes and wanes, the sun and moon revolve,
The human heart, free of filth, is likewise.
Half a sip of ghee ascends to the heavens,
The jade-like tone resounds, celebrating great years.

Cast aside all clamor, delve deeply into the Dao,
Forget both self and things, then awaken to the mystery.
Let go into the vast emptiness—this pure body,
Its radiance surpasses even the Dipper and Ox.

Seeking glory ultimately invites disgrace,
Scheming and pretense—knowing them, one loses the real.
If one grasps this mechanism,
Untroubled, one passes through the waning spring.

Day and night, whet the blade to learn the butcher’s art,
Dawn and dusk, equalize all things, yearn for true cultivation.
When the black mist before your eyes is wholly gathered,
The golden essence behind your elbow flows of itself.

Not in the tip of the brush or the tip of the tongue,
But through true practice, the work is perfected.
After ten years of walking to the place of no-mind,
A single luminous clarity belongs to nature.

**Two Poems in Response to Envoy Yuan’s Rhyme**

To remove the false is called harming the real,
When both real and false are removed, no realm can invade.
The bones of the Dao are refined, the flute and zither play,
Flowing rosy clouds celebrate, drunk in the jade forest.

Pound yin and yang to pieces, set them in the furnace,
Lightly stoke the fire, let it roll and simmer.
The great taboos are defilement by fame, wealth, and desire,
Those who take this elixir will surely extend their years.

**In Response to Instructor Gao’s Rhyme**

The immortal wind is awakened, the pure work complete,
A face of dust—let others not look down.
The heart-ground is wholly cleared, nothing else remains,
Exhausting the spirit, only the Dao sustains life.

**Four Poems in Response to Academician Li’s Rhyme**

In my studio, jade nectar fills the pot and cup,
Before my eyes, the green peach blossoms bloom.
I descended the mountain hall to invite a noble friend,
Yet alas, it came to naught—I returned alone.

I searched through all the fine sights of Yunzhou,
But the Golden Pavilion Mountain held the most.
A flowing stream, one brook, clear and vast,
Steep peaks on all sides, emerald and towering.

From childhood, I left home, far from worldly dust,
Amidst piled mist and rosy clouds, delighting in nature’s truth.
Though I have not yet become an immortal and departed,
For now, I make the green mountains my master.

Returning to the forest springs to study the Great Mystery,
Gather the heart, do not let the horse and monkey run wild.
All worldly affairs—completely unattached,
Vast and boundless, the spirit’s light fills the grotto-heaven.

**Four Poems in Response to Master Fu’s Rhyme**

Worldly fame and merit—I have ceased to strive,
Retiring, I hide away, pillow high, lying amidst clouds and mist.
Boundless leisurely realms all belong to me,
Bright moon and clear wind—no need for coin.

Awakening, I am too lazy to chase profit and fame,
The life of clouds and water is carefree and at ease.
Body and nature, serene, return to the grotto palace,
Suddenly, without care, I arrive in the human world.

All things I knew came to nothing,
Retiring, I lie high in the white-cloud capital.
The three lights’ wisdom shines, all demons scatter,
A single thought of no-birth transcends the five elements.

With mind, one investigates the mindless body,
Without affairs, the mysterious is still entangled in right and wrong.
I only wish these words would awaken people early,
Yet even returning to begin the work may be too late.

**Chongyang**

Frost falls on Wu River, the maple leaves fragrant,
By the fence, the chrysanthemums bloom to my heart’s content.
When shall I see the old man of Yuanming,
To face the west wind and laugh together?

**Mid-Autumn**

Deeper into the night, clouds retreat, the wind grows clearer,
The bright moon’s glow shines all the more.
With intent, I drink and chant, sharing the joy with all,
An immortal invites me to ascend and play in the divine capital.

**Two Poems for the Double Ninth**

The three paths of yellow blossoms glow in the setting sun,
The forest is full of red leaves, drunk on autumn frost.
Hanging up my cap and returning—this is life’s joy,
No envy for the madcap revelry of the poet-official.

How fine is the Double Ninth, leisure drawing near,
Red leaves flutter, playing in the west wind.
The west wind and red leaves—none understand,
Those who do grasp the workings of creation.

**Spring Rain**

The lad transmits the decree, descending from the Jade Capital,
Dragons emerge from the sea, riding the clouds.
Heaven and Earth send down this pure, cool rain,
Nourishing the yellow sprouts that grow all over the land.

**Rejoicing in Rain**

Long drought, the people suffer, praying to the sacred spirits,
Dragons emerge from the sea, riding clouds and rainbows.
Sweet dew descends in abundance, the farmers rejoice,
Donning bamboo hats and straw raincoats, they plow through the rain.

**Hearing the Cuckoo**

Before Golden Pavilion Mountain, the cuckoo cries,
Each call says, “Better to return.”
Which wanderer knows the true meaning of returning?
Only then does one realize how rare the enlightened are in this world.

**Two More Poems**

In the *renzi* year, dwelling in Yunzhou’s Lequan Hermitage.
Five days after the Summer Solstice, sudden snow fills the sky,
A yard above the ground, melting into rain.

Half follows the misty haze, half follows the wind,
Flying from the heavens, fusing with the earth.
Like a carefree Daoist of Cloud Brook,
Cultivating primordial *qi*, filling the void.

The summer heat oppresses, midday sleep deep,
Awakening, six-sided flakes congeal in the sky.
Yin and yang’s creation—knowing it is upside-down,
A single piece of the spirit terrace, cold as ice.

**Fishing Alone on a Cold River**

A single straw raincoat, a single leaf of a boat,
Why not fold your sleeves and come and go at ease?
Knowing this moon-white, wind-clear night,
Which fish would willingly take the hook?

**Roseleaf Raspberry**

A trellis of roseleaf raspberry flowers in full bloom,
The recluse says nothing, pacing back and forth alone.

**When Spring Departs and Returns**

Last year’s spring departed, only to return again,
This year’s spring arrives once more, repeating the same.

**The White Cloud Immortal Invites Reclusion**

Great reclusion need not be in the mountains’ depths—
Even in the city, one may yearn for true cultivation.
To blend with the world while knowing its ways,
With withered form and ashen heart, the nature remains free.

**Fool’s Studio**

Where the Two Modes blur indistinct,
When the primal *qi* was yet undivided.
"Recalcitrant as Hui, dull as Shen"—
Only the sage understands this feeling.

**Inscribed on a Paper Fan**

The immortal realm lies close, its path not long,
The spirit terrace unstained, awakened to truth.
Through the triple burners, summer heat scorches the bowels,
Yet one wave brings a bone-penetrating cool.

**Inscribed at Dragon Gate’s Nine Dragons Abbey**

Dragon Gate’s waters murmur day and night,
Mist and haze veil the low hills.
Endless scenes lie hidden in the jade-green grotto—
Who knows Penglai Isle dwells here among men?

**Inscribed at Lintong’s Huaqing Palace**

Yin departs, yang returns—such is nature’s way,
Cloud-wrapped mountains conceal a cavern heaven.
Through how many cycles of mulberry fields transformed,
The cinnabar in the crucible still refines as before.

**Inscribed at Juyang Mountain’s Mingzhen Abbey**

Behind Mingzhen Abbey rises Juyang Mountain,
Emerald peaks soar amid the azure sky.
Within, many carefree recluses dwell,
Enveloped in white clouds, free and at ease.

**Passing the Frontier at Jin in Autumn, Ding-Si Year**

In dreams, my heart returns to Guanghan,
Awakening, I remain in the dusty world.
A night’s west wind lifts the curtain fiercely,
Blowing open golden blossoms along the winding rail.

**In the Gui-You Year of Zhiyuan, Accompanying the Imperial Censor on a Sacred Mission to the Mountains and Rivers, Passing Jinan**

Relay horses clatter forth from the imperial capital,
Mountains and waters stir the poet’s heart.
In the endless valleys and streams,
Detached from care, forgetting thought, clarity arises.

**Two Poems on Mount Tai**

Stone steps at first ascent daunt the traveler,
Yet rising above the clouds, the heart finds peace.
Whence comes this celestial wind, so distant,
Making this mortal life seem to reach Guanghan?

In mid-March, I pay homage to Mount Tai,
The mountain air crisp, chilling the traveler.
Standing atop the peak to watch the sunrise,
Gazing down at the mortal world, the vista widens.

**Heavenly Altar**

Sleeves billowing in the wind, I visit the immortal altar,
Alone I come and go where none remain.
On jade nights, I pour my own wine,
Who plays the reed pipes in the azure heavens?

**Two Poems on Presenting Dragon Tablets**

After leaving the imperial capital, I reach Heavenly Altar,
Burning incense there to pray for eternal peace.
Delighted to witness the immortal lanterns’ auspicious glow,
Unprepared, I lean on the railing through the fine night.

By royal command, I descend the vermilion steps,
Crossing streams and threading forests into the emerald haze.
On the day of presenting the dragon tablet at the Queen Mother’s Grotto,
Cranes accompany me, soaring amid rosy clouds.

**Accompanying Attendant Cui Shuwen Across Dongting Lake**

Waters calm, wind gentle, auspicious mists clear,
I reverently burn fine incense to pray for sagely brightness.
A clumsy verse composed to pass the time,
Inscribed on Dongting’s wall to mark my passage.

**Inscribed at Zhurong Peak**

Worldly affairs and human sentiments are not worth seeing,
Returning, I conceal my traces behind pine gates.
On the solitary, lofty summit, none come,
Alone I ride the azure dragon, free to roam.

**Two Poems on Juyong Pass**

Half a year, how often I’ve passed Juyong Pass,
Who would believe this idle man is never idle?
What use are these drooping white hairs,
When green mountains remain and waters still murmur?

Pine winds and crying crows see travelers home,
A light rain clears, the path unmuddied.
Tell those who dwell at Juyong Pass,
Spring’s arrival is surely near.

**Dragon Gate**

Autumn comes, twice I pass Dragon Gate,
From head to toe, I bear the emperor’s grace.
Feet treading yellow clouds, I return to my homeland,
Hands lifting the blue sea to Kunlun’s heights.

**Penglai Mountain**

Since parting the mortal world to reach Penglai,
I shall never return to the world of men.
Beneath green peaks, a thatched hut with bamboo fence,
Leisurely facing white clouds, at ease.

**Passing Huizhou**

Straw sandals, a bamboo staff, a short hempen robe,
A drifting cloud, a wandering stream—I pass Huizhou.
Wind and rain urge my verse, yet no fine lines come,
Greedy to watch the dragons play in the blue current.

**Presenting Tablets at Jiyuan**

The jade hall’s rites concluded, I receive heaven’s decree,
Bearing the dragon tablets to cast into the water palace.
In late winter, harmonious *qi* flourishes,
The sacred tortoise swims playfully in the clear stream.

**Presenting Tablets**

Respectfully bearing the dragon tablets from the imperial realm,
I present them at the Jidu and Songyan shrines.
Heaven, for the sage’s sake, expands the realm of longevity,
Green mountains endless, waters ever flowing.

**On Mount Song, Following Attendant Cui Shuwen’s Rhyme**

A star of office, a feathered guest—delighted to travel together,
Harmonious *qi* suffuses, auspicious mists float.
Countless fine mountains greet our horses’ heads,
Each peak more elegant, each more secluded than the last.

**Ninth Month, Lodging at Qiuyang Abbey Amid Rain**

Rain passed, chrysanthemums exude a rare fragrance,
Wind scatters red leaves, hastening autumn’s departure.
Mountain birds fall silent, their mood profound,
Nameless wild grasses hold deeper principles.

**Mount Hua**

Just awakened by the sound of a spring, I seek the true,
Before the wind, beneath the moon.
Leaping upward to the southern peak’s summit,
I turn to gaze at the Northern Star’s reflected light.

**Two Poems on Passing Jingxing**

Spurring my horse at dawn through Jingxing,
The rugged long road stirs my poetic heart.
If this journey were governed by cock’s crow,
How often would my immortal dreams be shattered?

Layered cold clouds gather at my horse’s hooves,
Green mountains loom before its head.
The scenery is fine, yet no fine verse comes,
Greedy to listen to apes’ cries and tigers’ roars.

**Inscribed at Hidden Spring**

Mountain contours coil around the surging spring,
The grotto gate high, clouds and mist emerge.
Turning back from the world’s bustling vanities,
I claim this grotto as my own paradise.

**Self-Portrait**

Thirst quenched with the elixir of heaven and earth,
Hunger sated with the flesh of dragons and tigers.
Such joys are the idle man’s alone—
Not easily known by those who are not idle.

**Quatrain**

Here is the translation:

---

Long have I admired the land west of the Pure Yang Palace in Yongle, Hezhong, where the terrain is most excellent. I once considered relocating the burial site of my late master, the Perfected One of Cloud-Dispersing. The decision remained unresolved when, one day in stillness, I saw my master pass by the door. I hurried after him, but he had already vanished. Thereupon I composed this quatrain:

Unknowing, unaware—one may simply return,
Clear and bright, it is fitting for the season.
Matters of two ends follow your use of them;
Far or near, non-action is yet no lack of action.

**Answering a Question on Cultivation (Two Poems)**
I offer my humble views in reply to you,
The master’s profound words awakening the original truth.
Though I have yet to fully comprehend,
I need not again play the fool’s guide.

When the heart arises, myriad dusty conditions follow;
When intent dissolves, all aligns with the sage’s mechanism.
If one can grasp this principle,
Without moving a step, one arrives at Jasper Pool.

**Expressing My Feelings at Fanghu in Changchun Palace (Two Poems)**
The winding balustrade and secluded garden hold uncommon scenes,
Pines and cypresses stand dense as the setting sun descends.
Jade nectar brewed, I drink it beneath the moon;
Jade hairpins carry fragrance through the courtyard.

I would take the vast sea as fine wine,
And a gourd ladle as my giant cup.
Honoring the aged, I invite them to drink through the night,
Delighted by the company of pine winds and bamboo moonlight.

**Four Poems on the Upper Hermitage of Pengshan**
For ten years I have dwelt in the mountains, far from worldly affairs,
In recent years, my dreaming soul seems lighter.
Sleepless in the deep night, I sit in joy;
The bright moon fills the hall, the wind grows clearer.

Three sides of perilous peaks array like emerald screens,
Deep in the crags, ancient trees bear auspicious clouds.
I came intending to forget thoughts of return,
Yet how can I, when my work remains unfinished?

Within the courtyard, yellow blossoms bloom in all seasons,
Clouds, mountains, waters, and bamboo encircle the pavilion.
Do not say fine scenery goes unvisited—
Wind and moon need no invitation to come of themselves.

Leaning against the mountain, facing the stream, I build my thatched hut,
The gate opens amid the shadows of green pines.
This cave-heaven, though near, remains untrodden by men;
White clouds and secluded birds come and go.

**Inscribed on Mount Song, the Central Peak**
Emerald screens, jade pillars, and the Golden Flask—
I have traversed all peaks, yet none compare.
Orchid and angelica fragrance fills the courtyard,
Water’s radiance and mountain hues encircle my thatched hut.

**The Filial Son**
Loyal and obedient, steadfast, he forgets worldly attitudes,
In mourning, he strictly observes rites, casting aside frivolity.
How many filial sons exist in the world?
How many households emulate such sincerity?

**Two Poems on Seeing a Pavilion at Wutai on Mount Feng**
At Wutai, a pavilion overlooks a clear stream,
Brocade trees and screen-like mountains enclose it on all sides.
A stretch of mist and rosy clouds, the place untouched by footprints—
I take up my staff and walk alone, watching clouds take flight.

Yellow essence and aged trees serve as fine wine,
Earthenware and porcelain cups replace jade goblets.
I specially descended Wutai to invite old friends,
Yet alas, it did not come to pass—I returned alone.

**Addressing the Assembly**
North, south, east, west—all is one sky,
Within it, the subtle principles are truly transmitted.
Myriad affairs do not cling to the heart’s head;
A single luminous clarity belongs to nature.

**Thanking Magistrate Zhang Junyu**
In the summer of the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, Magistrate Zhang Junyu of the Imperial Library was dispatched by imperial decree to discuss the establishment of a shrine in the mountains. Due to my aged infirmity and grave illness, it did not come to pass. Thus, I composed this poem in gratitude.

Delighted to meet a kindred spirit, I spoke of our original bond,
How could I not wholeheartedly explain our lineage’s ways?
Ashamed of my lack of talent to aid the world,
I can only be master to the green mountains.

**Inscribed on White Cloud Hermitage**
On the Double Ninth Festival, people vie to admire the scenery,
I drag my staff of *li* wood to wander among the crowd.
At the immortal’s abode, I ask where the clouds reside—
White Cloud Hermitage lies near White Cloud Tower.

**Returning to the Old Retreat on Jin’ge Mountain**
In my old age, I pass the remaining years beneath the pines,
Recalling a couplet from my predecessor’s poem.
With a generous heart, I while away the days,
Calmly opening my Daoist eye to gaze upon the blue sky.

**For the Tile-Maker**
Green and white, clinking and clanking, four corners square,
Matching length, width, and thickness without dispute.
As if born to be broken, returning to the original master,
I compose this rustic poem as proof.

**Leaving the World (Two Poems)**
From now on, I will have nothing to do with worldly affairs,
For ten years I have lived free and unfettered among the peaks.
When the three thousand merits are complete, I ascend to the origin at dawn,
At midnight, I ride a dragon to the Moon Palace.

Harmonious *qi* circulates, the true nature unfolds,
Refining spirit and merging with the Dao, I rise beyond the dust.
Releasing my grip, I soar on the wind,
Turning my head, I shall not return to the human world.
