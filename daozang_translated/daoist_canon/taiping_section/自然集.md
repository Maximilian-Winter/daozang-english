**Daoist Lyrics #1**

**[Immortal Prosperity] "Rouged Lips"**
The Dao’s mystery is subtle and profound,
First one must awaken to the mind-ground—no easy feat.
Yet there lie the ancient sages’ writings,
Within them hidden the true message.

**[Mixed River Dragon]**
If speaking of the root of the primordial embryo,
Only through containing light and silently guarding emptiness to its utmost.
From movement seek stillness,
Stillness and stability are the subtle and profound.
Silent sitting, forgetting words—
This is the Dao’s communal dwelling,
Sealing the mouth is the Dao’s foundation.

There are those so-called enlightened masters,
Arrogant and self-aggrandizing, spouting wild and deceitful words.
Hearing the Dao by the wayside,
They obscure their own primordial spirit.
They fear neither Heaven’s scrutiny
Nor the six paths of rebirth.

**[Oil Gourd]**
The Dao is fundamentally wordless and actionless,
Its wondrous principle seizes the marrow of Heaven and Earth.
Within it, only the self may know,
From non-being, being arises—this one may yet comprehend.
In the jade crucible, constantly harmonize yin and yang.
Advance the fire’s work without delay,
Through the double gates, penetrate into the Mud Pill Palace.
Naturally, radiant light will manifest.

**[Joy Under Heaven]**
Golden liquid, returning elixir descends the jade ladder,
Refining and simmering, white snow flies.
The yellow sprout gradually grows,
Generating the substance of Heaven and Earth.
Within the body, the true path is not lost,
Transforming into jade pond-filled nectar.

**[Rear Courtyard Flowers]**
Hunger within satiety, satiety after hunger,
Drinking ghee to nourish kidney water.
Securely close the earth gate,
Transform true essence, swallow the jade bud.
Spitting rainbow mists, within the Yellow Court they meet,
Seeing the Metal Elder flush red.
The infant and the wu-ji,
Together with the primordial spirit, mutually protect.

**[Willow Leaf]**
Pursuing straight to the Heavenly Palace to meet,
The Alchemical Maiden weeps tears like rain,
The Ding Lad sighs deeply.
Arranging the auspicious time,
In an instant, gathering and parting, separation.

**[Golden Goblet]**
Mountain-top snow blown by the xun wind,
Sweet dew descends, drinking the medicinal spoon.
Adjusting the fire’s timing with meticulous effort,
For long, fully nurturing the tranquil spirit-turtle.
The elixir is complete, gold fills the house,
The crow and hare roam east and west.
If one inverts kan and li,
Refining soul and spirit, nurturing the embryo’s foundation.

**[Admiring Flowers]**
Temporarily selecting a patch of white snow piled on the ground,
Circulating the two qi, exchanging and drinking from the jade cup.
Within the three fields, warming and practicing the four phases’ harmonious body,
In the Fivefold Luminous Palace, guarding the true reality.
*[Refrain]*:
Refining the six-foot body to cultivate the self,
Transforming seven golden lotuses to follow everywhere.
Matching the eight trigrams, riding the simurgh to return,
Reaching the nine skies beyond,
Utterly displaying majestic might.

**[Finale]**
Ten years of bitter cultivation,
Nine streets as livelihood.
Eight hundred deeds refine the jade body,
The seven-star sword has always dispelled ghosts.
Within the six harmonies, penetrating the subtle and tranquil,
Singing the Dao, practicing the Five Ancestors’ non-action.
Who knows the effort within the four markets?
Nurturing the three fields, gathering beauty.
With the two heavens’ spirits aiding,
A single wheel of bright moon illuminates the mysterious mechanism.

**[Nanlü] "A Branch of Flowers"**
Since I left the household life,
By chance I met an enlightened master.
Enduring hardship for over a decade,
Working diligently through the nights of ignorance.
Transmitted was the Dao’s wondrous emptiness,
Instructing me to firmly secure the cinnabar field.
For this fleeting life, practicing Daoist arts.
Refining the fire’s timing, tempering and augmenting,
Entering stillness and stability—this is the bath.

**[Liangzhou]**
Utterly unmoving, unwavering in resolve,
Refining the golden elixir to escape suffering and leave the mundane,
Exchanging the mortal frame, forgetting words and reducing speech.
In a moment, gathering and restraining lead and mercury.
With root and foundation, returning to simplicity and truth,
With aspiration, soaring through clouds and mist,
With karmic affinity, flying to the celestial thoroughfare.
In initial study, earnestly upholding true words,
Seeing worldly people, greedy for wealth and lust, heedless of their fleeting lives,
Each one striving to amass gold and pearls.
When the great limit arrives, all is naught,
Wasting spirit, leaving the body withered.
From ancient times to now,
Immortals were originally made from mortals.
Determining floating and sinking, recognizing guest and host,
Gathering mercury, gathering lead—do not delay.
Asking oneself: is there being, is there non-being?

**[Announcing to Heaven]**
Transforming pure incense, blowing into the middle sky’s path,
In an instant, creation and transformation occur in a moment.
Gracefully dancing, seeking gulls at the sea’s bottom,
Delighting in the cold and desolate, the sparse and secluded.
Disciple and master,
Laughing and chanting, together stepping toward the immortals’ capital,
Returning home to the three isles of Penglai.
Day and night, effort without thought,
Dim and distant, vague and indistinct.
The Heavenly Gate opens, the Dao is clear and empty,
The earth gate is securely closed, endlessly withdrawing and adding.
The work of clarity and depth is done,
Sitting alone, forgetting words, silent speech,
Driving the river chariot up and down with ease.
The work complete, purely guarding,
Seeming to exist yet like non-being.
Brightly, not obscuring the original path,
Embracing the ten thousand images, the body clings not to a thread’s weight.

**[Crow Caws at Night]**
Circulating kun’s fire, qian’s heavenly mist,
Diligently guarding the jade crucible.
Refining true mercury into the supreme treasure,
Simmering white snow like golden pearls.
Tempering the yellow sprout into the earth mother,
Drinking the medicinal spoon, practicing true earth.
Subduing dragon and tiger,
Summoning wind and rain.

**[Finale]**
Transforming into a golden immortal, shedding the body to ride the wind away,
A single streak of cold light fills the great void.
There is the infant, the Alchemical Maiden,
The Yellow Woman matching the dear daughter.
In an instant, meeting in cloud and rain,
All immortals joyfully dancing.
Departing the worldly dust, leaving love and desire.
Early on, not turning back,
Wholeheartedly seeking Zhong and Lü.
Straight to Penglai to accompany the ancestral master,
Together with the host of immortals, resting in one place.
Ascending and descending the three palaces to the Purple Court,
Regulating breath, endlessly refining true earth.
Gathering the yellow sprout to tame dragon and tiger,
Riding the white crane, mounting the simurgh’s chariot.
Leaving the mortal realm, ascending the immortal path,
Again accompanying the pure wind as a companion,
And with the bright moon as the Dao’s master,
Flying into the Heavenly Palace to wander the immortals’ abode.

**[Double Tune] "New Water Melody"**

Within these gates, I have delved for decades,
Only now piercing the sages’ subtle transformations.
Stilling rise and fall to grasp the wondrous principle,
Advancing the earthly fire to refine the cinnabar field.
First restrain the mind’s horse and heart’s ape,
No longer entangled in worldly俗.
Halt and listen—
Practicing breath’s unbroken flow,
Inhaling and exhaling wind and cloud in due order.
By the time the Three Palaces ascend and transform,
The nine returns and seven reversals hold profound mystery.
Driving the river chariot, moving swift as smoke,
Refining the clear wind to reach the Golden Duke’s court.
Should the Dao-heart grow firm,
The Yellow River’s surging waves turn the mud-pill.
Step by step, gracefully—
The great Way has ever been hard for mortals to envy,
Appearing as shadow without form.
Within the gourd lies another heaven,
Where golden elixir is refined to nurture the fetal immortal.
Along the twin-pass road, qi flows ceaselessly,
Fermenting sweet dew, frequently swallowed.

Intoxicated by the eastern wind—
When the great limit arrives, no choice is made,
Nor does rank or wealth matter.
Simply pushed on, again and again,
Each day vowing anew, vowing anew.
This year deferred to the next,
Delaying cultivation, the path still far.
How to escape the wheel of birth and death?

Like the wild goose’s fall, the triumphant command—
I once met a radiant master who transmitted the true Dao,
Pointing to the effortless teaching.
Taught me to curb greed and desire,
To devote more effort, cultivate more goodness.
Taught me to cast off fame and profit,
To pore over ancient texts.
All reveal the gateway to the mysterious,
To study closely with the true master.
If my merit is complete,
I gain the workings of creation unseen by others.
Just as the heart grows firm,
Firmness comes naturally.

Pouring fine wine—
Within the lead-mercury crucible, the fire burns,
Refining the supreme treasure with ceaseless care.
The wonder lies in the waxing and waning moon,
A clear path revealed.
Drawing the primordial spirit to the palace,
The subtle workings of the three passes transform.
One qi penetrates the three fields,
Nine revolutions in the furnace, smoke and flame.
Dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake coil,
Emerging from spontaneity,
Spontaneously a true person of non-action appears.

Rowing the river oar—
How joyfully I laugh,
Resting with the immortals.
No need to seek the Dao or study Chan,
Only to sit in silence, forgetting words.
Regulating true breath without panting,
There is the prior heaven and the posterior heaven.

Before the palace’s joy—
I urge the worthy:
Pray, always study the *Pointers to the Mysterious*.
The great Dao of non-action entices all,
To fulfill merit and complete the work,
Riding the crane to ascend the heavens.
Only then entering the effortless transmission,
Early fulfilling the vow of cultivation.
Cultivating one who neither comes nor goes,
Who would cling to this world for long years?

Resting the fingers, tuning the strings—
This time, who would be bound by worldly俗?
Transcending the mundane, entering the sagely, following the transformations.
Forgetting both Dao and method, tightly controlling withdrawal and addition,
Singing of the true arrival at Penglai’s paradise.
Composing the lower section’s natural collection,
Early is the *Chapter of Emptiness and Nothingness*.
May the heart’s wishes be fulfilled.

**[Zheng Gong] "Rolling Embroidered Ball"**
Cultivating effort, opening wisdom and concentration,
Refining the Three August Ones to form the sagely embryo.
The infant suddenly startled,
In an instant flying past the spirit terrace.
Arriving at the Yellow Court’s inner palace,
Joyfully stirring the yang pass to array dragon and tiger.
In a moment, forging them into one,
Stilling rise and fall, tempering the three calamities.
The three flowers gather at the mud-pill’s summit,
The five qi return to the origin, circling the jade street.
Descending the twelve towers.

If you’re a talented scholar—
Harmonizing lead and mercury in the smelter,
Suddenly seeing the Kan maiden and Li lad unite.
The Golden Duke is buried here,
Creating the workings of creation, laughing merrily.
How proper and fine—
Who would know my stillness yields great merit?
This time, early free from dust.
In youth, I once paid homage to a radiant master,
Taught me to leap from the bewitching fortress.

Welcoming the immortal guest—
Always tending the jade furnace’s gate,
Must open these eight doors.
Using Kan and Li in inversion,
Driving the river chariot, the ox plows in circles.
Transporting the load into the palace,
Gathering it beyond the three fields.

Red embroidered shoes—
In sitting and lying, yang ascends and yin descends,
One aperture opens, a hundred apertures open in unison.
Nine returns, seven reversals settle the three calamities,
Breath opens to the wondrous Dao,
Regulating true breath to fill the cheeks,
Refining essence and flower to return to the qi sea.

Old Bao—
Refining the primordial spirit to behold self-mastery,
Nurturing the fetal immortal, smiling face aglow,
The three fields’ qi surging through the breast.
Tempering the supreme treasure yields great merit,
Ten thousand words, a thousand phrases, each fitting,
All emerging from the realm of *Dao and Its Virtue* and *The Yin Talisman*.
Activating the heavenly pass to moisten the nine realms,
Gathering medicinal substances beyond heaven and earth.
Within the white cloud’s embrace, ascension swift,
Transforming through kalpas of cultivation.

Playful child—
At first learning, earnestly loving the true heart,
Broadly reading scriptures and commentaries.
Suddenly, the mind’s earth opens in enlightenment,
Recalling past days of burial.
Truly, there is a path to ascend as immortal,
Freely roaming wherever one pleases.
Repaying this karmic debt,
This time, cutting all ties, unstained by a thousand calamities.

**Finale**
In stillness, silently practicing,
Dividing the knife’s edge between black and white.
The spirit terrace empty, enduring patience,
Departing the path of birth and death to cultivate the true,
Instead planting the withered pine day and night.
For now, awaiting the time,
Nearly merit complete, work fulfilled,
Alone ascending the terrace of heaven.

**Second Finale**
No need to read the books of the three teachings,
No need to learn the talent of seven steps.
Only to dimly, silently endure the work’s progress.
Refining the jade body to ride the wind away,
A single beam of cold light entering the sagely ranks.
Becoming a guest of Penglai,
Relying entirely on three thousand merits fulfilled,
Then shedding the mortal frame to attain the immortal embryo.

**Third Finale**
When weary, riding the green simurgh to fly to heaven,
Driving the white crane to return to earth,
Ascending the immortal realm through transformation.
The yellow sprout gradually grows, unknown to others,
In the jade rabbit’s nest, well hidden.
For now, awaiting the time,
Nearly merit complete, work fulfilled,
Alone ascending the terrace of heaven.

**Finale**
There is quiet work, there is meditative work,
Unburdened, unentangled.
This time, the debt to human ties is repaid,
Leaping free from the sea of delusion and strife.

**[Zhenggong] Duanzheng Hao**
Cast aside right and wrong,
Brush away contention and conflict,
Tightly rein in this heart-ape and mind-horse.
I only wish to dance in the west wind, sleeves wide as falling leaves,
Watching the sun and moon turn day into night.

**Gun Xiuqiu**
A thousand households’ rice is enough to beg,
A hundred-patched robe brings no shame.
Why cling to this fleshly shell,
Proud before the lords and nobles of the world?
I only wish to wander carefree, singing Daoist hymns,
Drunk and tipsy, bowing in reverence.
Alms-gathered sacred soup and immortal wine,
A staff and gourd—these are my only possessions.
I only wish to drink today when there is wine,
Beg tomorrow when there is no coin.
In the end, bare-chested and free from care.

**Tang Xiucai**
Some hoard books for their descendants, yet they may not all be kept,
Some amass gold for their descendants, yet it may not all be guarded.
I urge you: do not labor like an ox or horse for your children.
Today, clouds shape mountains with artful grace,
Tomorrow, frost recedes, leaving water’s trace.
How can one endure the racing hare and fleeing crow?

**Gun Xiuqiu**
Just now, the Lantern Festival’s lamps were carried in hand,
Soon, willow branches were planted before the gates at Qingming.
Just as wine cups circled the winding stream in purification rites,
Unnoticed, the dragon boats’ drums thundered in the races.
Just now, it was the seventh day of the seventh month,
Soon, it was the ninth day of the ninth.
How many times can we joyfully linger together?
All our springs and autumns pass in vexation.
You see this tangled world—why not drift with fate?
None heed how swiftly time flows like water,
Turning hair to white.

**Tang Xiucai**
Some build gardens, laying bricks for ponds,
Some erect pavilions, carving beams and brackets.
Exhausting effort to complete their work.
Today, it is the Zhang family’s land,
Tomorrow, it becomes the Li family’s tower.
All is as fleeting as a hand’s turn.

**Gun Xiuqiu**
Clearing brambles to make a pond,
Uprooting weeds to plant flowers and willows,
In four seasons, it blooms like embroidered silk,
Yet how many times can the master wander and return?
Here, pavilions soon decay,
Flowers and trees wither in turn,
Thorns reclaim their place,
Making travelers sigh at the passing of time.
Once, rare blossoms and exotic plants flourished in a thousand hues,
Now, they are but wild grasses and idle flowers, strewn in sorrow.
Truly, this is not the autumn of fallen leaves.

**Dai Guduo**
Speak not of Yao, Shun, Jie, or Zhou,
Better to follow Hao Wangsun, Tan Maqiu, or Liu.
They were disciples of Wen Zhongzi, friends of Kang Cangzi.
Speak not of officials like Zhang Pingshu or courtesans like Liu Xingshou.
Better to follow Perfected Wang, founder of Quanzhen,
Or turn back halfway, like the horse at Ban Prefecture.

**Zui Taiping**
Han Zhongli was once a general,
Lan Caihe was once a wandering performer.
Master Xuanhu never went to sell wine,
Tieguai Li’s body was burned to ash.
He Lianxian guided Cao Guojiu,
Han Xiangzi could brew wine in an instant.
Lü Dongbin, thrice drunk at Yueyang Tower,
Delivered a single green willow.

**Tail**
Speak not of when merit and work will be complete—
Once the mysterious pass is entered, one may join the ranks.
In the realm of self and others, all striving is in vain,
Better to turn back early from the bitter sea.

What of wandering the four great realms,
Or the three isles and ten continents?
These immortals hide their traces, bury their names,
They only wait for the present moment to depart.

**[Zhenggong] (Untitled)**
I practice the art of self-liberation,
You scheme to harm others and build a household.
You call me mad—you are even madder.
Here, I have seen through fame and profit,
While your greed is as vast as the heavens.
Here, I laugh at the arena of fame and gain, seeing it clearly,
Why trouble yourself for children, tossed in endless waves?
Hoarding ill-gotten wealth, amassing useless goods,
When death comes, how will you escape?
Inevitably, you’ll be reborn as a mule or horse.
The path to heaven lies open, yet few walk it,
The gates of hell have no doors, yet many enter.
Fallen and forlorn,
Thus ends the *Natural Collection*.

**[1]** All entries in this section are *sanqu* (vernacular songs). The original lacks musical modes; these have been reconstructed here.

**[2]** This piece was originally titled *Zhenggong* (Proper Palace Mode) but lacked a specific tune name. Based on the *Taihe Zhengyin Pu* (Orthodox Sounds of Grand Harmony) compiled by Zhu Quan of the Ming dynasty, which includes Deng Xueke’s suite under *Zhenggong·Duanzhenghao* (Proper Palace Mode·Upright and Proper) titled *Le Dao* (Joy in the Dao), this tune is adopted here. The following text follows the Ming edition, with emendations noted but not annotated in detail.

*"Begging for leftover broth and dregs of wine,
This fool’s drum and clapper are my stage props."*

**[4]** *Gang yisi* ("just like"): The Ming edition reads *da gang lai zhishi* ("all comes down to"), which is also coherent.

**[5]** The Ming edition renders this line as:
*"Were it not for Patriarch Wang, the revealer of the Perfect Realization,
One could not seize even half a province of the rebirth-cycle’s horses."*
