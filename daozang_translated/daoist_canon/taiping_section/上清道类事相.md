**Fascicle One of *Upper Clarity Daoist Ritual Matters***

**Chapter on Immortal Abodes** (also called *Daoist Precincts*, *Mystic Altars*, *Refinement Halls*, or *Jinghai*)

The *Scripture of Original Forms* states: During the Dragon Han era, the Heavenly Worthy refined the true script within the Seven Treasures Hall of the Northern Ridge’s Mystic Mound, where the celestial radiance of the Great Primordial inscribed the hall’s four sides.

The *Three Caverns Regulations* states: The establishment of *jing* halls and palace chambers follows the precept of "tranquility and governance," cultivating Heavenly Virtue. Heavenly Virtue refers to the earth of *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, and *ding*. For lay households, it is called *jing*; for masters’ abodes, it is called *zhi*. All measure one *zhang* and eight *chi* in length and one *zhang* and six *chi* in width. Those who bear the talismans and registers of the immortals and spirits must establish *jing* and *zhi*.

The *Dharma Wheel Scripture* states: Upon beholding terraces and halls, one’s thoughts become boundless, gazing universally across the eight directions. Body and spirit unite, penetrating the subtle and obscure. Now, *guan* (observation) means to gaze, to observe the eight directions. The eight directions are the eight cardinal points. If one can settle the spirit and stabilize the will, one will penetrate the wondrous and subtle, seeing clearly into the obscure and profound. The obscure and profound, the wondrous and subtle, are the ultimate fruit of the Great Profound and True Unity. Thus, the *Five Thousand Character Upper Scripture* states: "Ever desireless, one observes its mystery; ever desiring, one observes its subtlety." In the present text, the character *wei* (subtle) is mistakenly written as *hui* (emblem), a case of graphic similarity leading to a long-standing scribal error.

The *Upper Clarity Scripture of Transformations* states: The Western Terrace Hall is where the Two Perfected partake of service and where records are inscribed. It also speaks of the Nine Mysteries Hall, the Great Ultimate Abode (where the Upper Clarity’s supreme perfected undergo transformation), and the Purple Supreme Abode (wherein the secret true script of the Great Numinous is concealed).

The *Upper Clarity Scripture* states: The Harmonious Dawn Numinous Abode is where the Jade Dawn Dao Lord resides.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Hall of Shifting Changes is where the Lady of Harmonious Dawn dwells.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Distribution* states: The Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning, at the Radiant Rosy Clouds Abode, commanded the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens to descend and bestow the jade tablets upon the Upper Perfected.

The *Numinous Writ Scripture* states: In the northern realm of Yüdan, there is the Cavern Numinous Hall, its height matching the clouds. Its interior is dark and lightless, its four sides devoid of illumination. Yet another Cavern Numinous Hall exists, luminous and manifest, its four sides transparent as the radiance of the sun at midday. The Heavenly Worthy sealed the celestial script within this hall, hence its name, the Cavern Numinous Hall. It also states: At times, the Supreme Dao Lord, in the Southern Cinnabar Cavern Yang’s Upper Hall of Cypress Mound, bowed in reverence to inquire of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who expounded the *Upper Scripture on the Roots of Transgressions*.

The *Hidden Words of the Numinous Treasure* states: "In the Northern Numinous Hall of Conjoined Radiance, we soar hand in hand above the clouds." It also states: The Heaven of Constant Fusion possesses the Purple Tenuity Hall, situated above the Jade Clarity, resplendent within the Purple Void. It further states: "Passing through the courtyard of the Three Realms, one ascends into the Hall of the Great Numinous."

The *Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Flight* states: The Dao Lord roams the Feathered Shade Hall, resting at the Gate of the Cavernous Vastness.

The *Scripture of the Eight Festivals’ Atonement* states: On the days of the eight solar terms, the Supreme Emperor of the August Prime ascends to the Upper Clarity’s Moonlit Cold realm, the numinous dwelling of the Great Void’s palace, the Cinnabar-Purple Terrace, the everlasting Jade Towers. The host of immortals gathers at the Great Tenuity Abode to deliberate and determine the karmic fortunes of the world’s myriad people.

The *Transmissions of Daoist Learning* states: Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, in his mountain-climbing poem, wrote: "Gazing upward at the arrayed immortals’ halls, looking down upon the jade spirits’ dwellings." It also states: Xu Yufu’s great-grandson, Lingzhen, during the Liang dynasty, was by imperial decree established at Mao Mountain’s Successive Perfected Hall to honor his distant ancestor’s virtue. Tao Hongjing’s residence, the Vermilion Yang Hall, was the former abode of the Senior Scribe Xu. It further states: Kong Lingchan, styled Yanling, a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji, delved deeply into the essentials of the Dao and perused the entire corpus of immortal texts. Emperor Ming of the Song established the Cherishing Immortals Hall beside the Yu Cavern and decreed that he reside there. It also states: Emperor Gao of Chen delivered lectures at the Righteous Immortals Hall. Xiao Ziyi of Lanling, styled Qianhua, rose from his seat clad in coarse cloth and donated his woven silk scripture scarf to serve as an offering. After Ziyi’s passing, the ritual implements and scriptures were all absorbed into the public treasury, and the scarf from the Abbey of Peace remains preserved to this day. It also states: Emperor Wu of Liang established the Great Clarity Hall on Mount Tianmu, inviting all Daoist communities to gather and rest there.

Within stands a dark-azure jade table, draped with a canopy of cloud-woven silk. Water-green jade is carved into inverted dragons, fire essence forms the sun, and black jade is carved into crows. Water essence forms the moon, and various jades compose the toad and hare. Beneath the ground lies a mechanism that ensures the waxing and waning of the moon remain unerring. Fragrant winds arrive cool and refreshing; to receive them with outstretched sleeves is to remain sated for ages without weariness.

The *Upper Scripture of the Phoenix Terrace and Pure Silk* states: "The moon shines upon the Western Flower Hall, its intent harmonizing with the Moonlit Cold Palace."

Gazing afar, the boundless wilds stretch endlessly;
looking upward, one beholds the kalpas’ edge.

Yin Xi’s *Original Record of the Abbey of Lofty Contemplation* states:
In former times, King Kang of Zhou, hearing that Master Yin possessed the grand aspiration of transcendence and immortality, appointed him as a grandee and named his residence the Abbey of Lofty Contemplation. Later, King Mu of Zhou expanded this abbey, summoning reclusive worthies to become Daoists and reside within. From then on, the tradition continued unbroken to this day.

The *Sacred Records of Lord Lao* states:
King Mu of Zhou also built an abbey for Du Chong, styled Xuanyi, of Haojing, appointing Chong as a Daoist within. Later, Chong attained the rank of Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate.

Thus it is known that the establishment of abbeys among men began with King Kang of Zhou. The placement of Daoists within abbeys, however, originated with King Mu of Zhou. As for the name "Daoist," it first arose at the time of the initial separation of Heaven and Earth. The designation of "immortal abbey" predates even the division of Heaven and Earth, existing before the Four Heavens in the Great Luo Heaven. Above the Great Luo Heaven stands the Jade Capital Mountain, home to the Abbey of the Dark Metropolis.

The *Transmissions of Daoist Learning* states:
Emperor Wen of Liu Song established the Abbey of Revering the Void for Master Lu, with Liu Faxian as its director, bestowing upon him the title of National Preceptor. Dong Shuaifa, a native of Pengcheng, was later summoned by Emperor Ming of Liu Song to serve as its director.
It further states: In the fifteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, Emperor Wu built the Abbey of the Supreme Clarity and Dark Mystery for Tao Hongjing to unify and illuminate the teachings of the Dao.
It further states: Zhang Yunzhi, a native of Jiaxing in Wu Commandery, left home in his youth to follow masters and companions. After five years, he was imperially appointed as the director of the Abbey of Revering the Origin at the Southern Cavern of Mount Mao. Later, a separate site before the abbey was established as the Abbey of Jinling, where he secluded himself from worldly affairs to cultivate the supreme Dao.

Xue Biaozhi, a native of Jinling, during the reign of Emperor Gao of Qi, went to Mount Mao to build a hut, subsisting on pine seeds and stream water for many years. When Emperor Gao of Qi sought out reclusive Daoists during his revolution, learning that Biaozhi remained steadfast in the hills and valleys, unmoved by honor or rank, he imperially appointed him as the director of the Abbey of Jinling on that mountain.

Cheng Tongsun, styled Anren, was a native of Guoshan County in Yixing. Of profound and keen disposition, he stood alone and unyielding. In his youth, he left home, maintaining a long-term vegetarian diet. Near and far, all who met him deepened their faith. In the sixteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, he was imperially appointed as the senior seat of the Abbey of Tranquil Mind, where he governed the assembly with exemplary virtue and conduct.

Meng Zhizhou, a native of Jianye in Danyang, lectured at the Abbey of Revering the Void during the Liu Song dynasty, composing the *Repentance Text of the Ten Directions*.

Xue Biaozhi, a native of Jinling, in the second year of the Jianwu era of Qi, sojourned in the eastern lands to seek out true secrets. After three years, he returned and petitioned to establish the Abbey of the Grotto Heaven on the eastern ridge of Great Mount Mao.

Jiang Fuchu, a native of Yixing, came and went from Mount Mao, aspiring to dwell there. Emperor Gao of Qi built an abbey on the mountain, and in the second year of the Jianyuan era, he was imperially summoned to perform the Daoist rites at the Abbey of Zongyang. Fuchu later established the Abbey of Assisting Perfection at the former residence of Director Xu, where he attended to the toils of reception. He then entrusted the affairs of the abbey to his second son, Hongsu, to focus solely on cultivating the supreme methods.

Dongxiang Zongchao, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. He donated his former residence to establish the Abbey of Aspiring to the Mystery. There, he wove vines into a hut, thatched it with mallow, and together with his disciples, labored with their own hands. Though unadorned, the abbey was swiftly completed. During the reign of Emperor Jianwen of Liang, when the Prince of Luling was stationed there, he grandly constructed halls and corridors, all resplendent and magnificent, with ritual implements of exquisite refinement. Yet the master’s dwelling remained a thatched hut, his attire unchanged, his curtains of woven leaves maintaining austerity. He always sat upon a single round, worn-out couch, its surface grooved by his knees, his straw hat and rush mat frayed and unaltered.

It further states: The Daoist Zhang Fameng established the Abbey of Stone Islet on the northern bank of the Yuan Pond’s rocky islet, inviting Jia Leng to lecture there for three years. The Liang emperor commanded Yan Jizhi to reside within, where all offerings of food and ritual feasts were vegetarian. (See the *Biography of Jia Leng*.)

In the early Liu Song dynasty, Prince Jing of Changsha built a Daoist retreat east of Director Xu’s residence. In the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, it was imperially designated as the Abbey of Vermilion Yang. Emperor Ming of Liu Song summoned Master Lu Quan to reside at the Lodge of the Cavalry Barge, where guests and visitors were received with constant hospitality. Thus it is known that the term "retreat" is commonly used across the Three Teachings.

Yin Faren, styled Zidao, was a native of Yangxia in Chen Commandery. He left home in his youth, diligently reciting scriptures and maintaining a vegetarian diet. There was a Chen Wenhe, a wealthy man of the capital, who established the Abbey of Righteous Transcendence and invited Faren to reside there.

The Abbey of the Nine Perfected was the residence of Wang Lingyu, styled Shanbao, a native of Qu’a in Jinling, where he focused on cultivating the supreme Dao. He was imperially granted two hundred abbey laborers, along with gold, silk, incense, and medicines—all provided in abundance.

Xie Xuan, styled Yuanying, was a native of Yangxia in Chen Commandery.

He maintained a perpetual vegetarian diet, devoting himself entirely to cultivating the Dao. On Shangyu Mountain, he cleared away brambles to open a path and established a mountain abbey—an achievement that seemed like divine work.

Zhu Ding, styled Shu’an, was a native of Nan Sha in Xin Yi. Fond of the divine immortals, he entered Haiyu Mountain in his youth to study under Xie Xuan. Seeing his resolve, Xuan allowed him to reside at the Yuanyang Abbey, where he was tasked with safeguarding Master Zhu’s scriptures. Later, to the right of the Yuanchang Abbey, he established a separate retreat, cutting off all human traffic.

Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Dongqian in Wu Xing. At the foot of a waterfall on the southeast side of Mount Lu, he built an abbey named Jianji, a secluded and profound place with magnificent and extraordinary construction. Those who beheld it were filled with reverence, evoking visions of the Kunlun and Lang ranges. Later generations thus honored Xiujing with the title "Master of Simplicity and Tranquility."

Wang Sengzhen, a native of Jin Shou in Liang Zhou, established the Futang Abbey in An Lu of Pan Zhou. Passing through Ying Zhou on his return, he also built the Shenwang Abbey, both of which were exquisitely adorned. Additionally, he founded the Jiuzhen Abbey on Mount Heng. In Jing Zhou, there was the Shixing Abbey, where Yu Chengxian of Ying Zhou expounded the Daoist scriptures. Chu Boyu, styled Yuanqu, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Jun. He withdrew to the Waterfall Mountain of Mount Nan Heng, mastering esoteric arts and delving deeply into mystical diagrams and secrets. He practiced alchemical refinement and ingestion without exception. Emperor Gaozu of the Qi Dynasty summoned him with ceremonial gifts from the two commanderies of Wu and Kuaiji, but he declined on grounds of illness.

Shortly thereafter, Boyu passed away, and Emperor Gaozu mourned his loss. He then ordered the establishment of the Taiping Abbey at the foot of Waterfall Mountain. Boyu had been fond of studying the *Scripture of Great Peace* and practiced its Way, hence the name of the abbey.

Sun Yue, styled Xuanda, was a native of Yongkang in Dongyang. In the third year of Yongming during the Qi Dynasty, he was summoned by imperial decree to serve as the master of Xingshi Abbey. There, he diligently cultivated the supreme Way and earnestly guided disciples, with several hundred constantly receiving his teachings.

It is also said that during the Yongming era, Prefect Wang Liang and Magistrate Gu Hui of Jinling petitioned the court to construct a terrace in the outskirts, where they established the Qizhen Abbey for Li Jingyou, styled Huiguan, a native of Jinling. On the eve of its construction, they dreamed of King Yan of Yan, who presented twenty pillars to aid in building the Daoist sanctuary. Soon after, they arrived at a body of water within the city and saw rosewood pillars filling the water—once the required number was taken, they vanished. Popular lore holds that King Yan of Yan was a figure from the Warring States period.

Xu Mingye, a native of Chigang in Fufeng, left home in his youth and maintained a strict vegetarian diet. During the Taiqing era of the Liang Dynasty, he was invited by the Prince of Nanping, the provincial governor, to reside at the Shenwang Abbey north of the city. When turmoil arose, he retreated to Mount Qingxi in Wuchang, where he established an abbey, earning reverence from both near and far.

Yang Chao, styled Chaoyuan, was a native of Donghai. During the Liang Dynasty, he entered Mount Bao in Wu to serve as the master of Linwu Abbey, where his disciples numbered in the thousands. He also served as the master of Huayang Abbey and separately established the Zhaozhen Abbey to its east.

Feng Faxian, styled Fayuan, was a native of Qu’e in Jinling. During the Chen Dynasty, the Chongyuan Abbey was built on Mount Mao, its grandeur unmatched. In the early reign of Emperor Wu of Chen, a monk from Jinling died and revived after seven days, reporting: "In heaven, a great hall is being constructed, intended for Master Feng of Mount Mao." The monk, upon reviving, sought to visit the mountain to verify his vision. When he arrived at the foot of the mountain and inquired among the locals, he confirmed that Master Feng was indeed still alive.

Zhang Yu, the twelfth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master, left home in his youth. During the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty, he established the Zhaozhen Abbey on Mount Yu and resided there, capable of attaining the immortal Way.

Shi Xixian, styled Jidao, was a native of Wu. He left his wife, maintained a strict vegetarian diet, and established an abbey. Emperor Wu of Liang praised him and bestowed upon it the name Datong Xuanguan.

There was also Xu Shizi, styled Dewei, a native of Dongmei. He left home and adopted a vegetarian diet. Emperor Wu of Chen established the Zongxu Da Abbey and appointed Shizi as its master.

Wang Yuanqi, a native of Taiyuan, was skilled in ritual repentance and served as the master of Jizhen Abbey, where he performed the Three Cycles of the Daoist rites.

Chunyu Puhua, styled Fadong, was a native of Wu Jun who left home in his youth. In the northern market, there was a stone named Sheng. He donated his residence to establish an abbey named Chongxin and was appointed its master.

Zhang Yuanfei, styled Jingming, resided in Caipo Village in Qu’e. Later, she traveled to the capital and constructed the Zhide Abbey north of the Eastern Prefecture’s city. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, she was invited to retreat to Mount Mao, where she built the Xuanming Abbey in the southern cave. There, she abstained from grains, consumed pine roots, and devoted herself to breath cultivation. In the third year of Yongding, she journeyed to Mount Yu in Haiyu, where she announced her transformation at the Nanshaqiu Abbey before returning to be buried on Mount Mao.

There was also Li Lingcheng, a woman from Luling. In her youth, she left home and renounced worldly life, entering Mount Lu. In Yanjing Village of Qianfu Township, she built a cloister named Huaguan. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Liang, a master of precepts named Anjing governed the abbey, which was called Tiande. Tiande referred to the land of Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. Among the laity, it was called *jing* (tranquility), while among the clergy, it was called *zhi* (governance). It measured eighteen feet in length and sixteen feet in width.

All those who bear the sacred talismans and registers of the immortals in their governance must establish a ritual seat for their practice.

*Concluded: First Scroll of Rites and Forms in the Upper Clarity Daoist Corpus*
*Second Scroll of Rites and Forms in the Upper Clarity Daoist Corpus: On Towering Pavilions*

Below, within the immortal halls, stand the seven-jeweled mansions. The *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit* states: "On Mount Penglai stands a golden tower, rising six hundred and forty leagues high." The *Inner Tones* says: "Ascending the terraced pavilion above, one gazes upon the eight directions and the realms of the Three Worlds." The *Jade Instructions of the Great Cavern* declares: "Array golden gates within the Crimson Tower of Primordial Simplicity." The *Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: "The Supreme Origin lies beyond the Void Cavern; Primordial Simplicity rests above the Dark Mystery.
