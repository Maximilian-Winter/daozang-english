**Scroll One of *The Three Caverns' Pearl Bag*: The Chapter on Salvation and Guidance**

The *Biographies of Daoist Scholars* (Chapter Four) states: Ren Dun, styled Shangneng, was a native of Bochang. During the Yongjia era, he retreated to Yunyang Mountain—Yunyang being another name for Maoshan. He ingested red halloysite, occasionally venturing among the people while always holding scriptures and precepts in hand, instructing the ignorant masses. Thus, those near and far reverently followed his teachings. Dun sighed in secret: "Though the people claim to admire goodness, it is but an outward show; I have yet to see a single true heart with whom I might cut metal asunder."

It further states: Du Jiong, styled Zigong, in his prime awakened to faith with diligent devotion. He revered the Orthodox Unity tradition, briefly studying talismanic registers under the Celestial Master, using them to transform and guide others, universally aiding and rescuing all. His conduct was pure and meticulous, his heart empty of self as he uplifted others, seeking no alms or offerings. He established a tranquil oratory, widely propagating salvation and protection, with all his works bearing immediate efficacy.

It further states: When Lu Na served as Minister of Works at the age of forty, he suffered from sores and told Jiong, "Generations have been short-lived, and all face this affliction at life’s end." Jiong submitted a memorial to the heavens and gave him the *Divine Flying Powder*. He said, "Your destined calamity has passed; you may live to seventy." And so it came to pass.

**Scroll Five** states: Yan Junping, whose given name was Zun, was a native of Shu’s capital. He cultivated the Dao for self-preservation. When speaking to others’ sons, he grounded his words in filial piety; to ministers, in loyalty; to younger brothers, in obedience. Adapting to each person’s inclinations, he guided them toward goodness. The people of Shu were transformed by him, and more than half followed his counsel.

It further states: Liu Ningzhi, styled Zhi’an and nicknamed Longevity, was a native of Zhijiang in Nanjun. Dwelling on the southern slopes of Mount Heng, he gathered herbs and practiced ingestion, receiving the Celestial Master’s teachings on transforming the people. He and his wife both wore talismans, rescuing others from disasters and perils, with frequent divine efficacy.

**Scroll Six** states: Zhu Huikai, styled Zhiyuan, was a native of Wucheng in Wuxing. He devoted himself to precepts, self-cultivation, and aiding others. In the eighth year of the Daming era of the Qi, when famine struck the land, Huikai had a modest store of grain. He distributed it all to relieve the destitute, and his village depended on him. Three starving men ate their fill and died, their families suing the county, accusing Huikai of feeding them to death and slandering him bitterly. The magistrate laughed and said, "To die from eating one’s fill after begging—should one resent the host? There is no law for this." He dismissed the case without inquiry.

**Scroll Seven** states: Master Lu was summoned by Emperor Wen of the Song to the palace, where he expounded on principles and the Dao without pause, day or night, tirelessly instructing and exhorting.

**Scroll Eight** states: Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Pingyang in Weijun. He styled himself the Recluse of Huayang, delighting in secret virtue, aiding the distressed and impoverished, and constantly preparing efficacious remedies. He dispensed medicines to the sick, and those near and far relied on him.

**Scroll Nine** states: Pan Hong, styled Wensheng, was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. By nature, he loved to bestow alms. Each winter, he repeatedly made winter garments to distribute to the poor, moving from house to house to provide them.

**Scroll Ten** states: Dongxiang Zongchao, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. During years of famine, he frequently provided large quantities of food, drawing crowds from near and far at midday. Each winter, he made many lined jackets, distributing them as circumstances allowed.

It further states: Yan Jizhi, styled Jingchu, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. He was indifferent to wealth and fond of giving, aiding the distressed and impoverished. Well-versed in the Dao and its principles, whenever a county official fell ill, he secretly performed rituals, privately arranging matters and offering thanks at the proper time.

It further states: Fang Qianzhi, styled Daochong, was a native of Baixian in Zhaojun, Jizhou. He entered the secluded Tianmu Mountain, transforming the villages and countryside, turning evil to good, urging people to seek learning and embrace benevolence, and turning toward the Great Dao.

It further states: Burying the exposed bones of the dead and interring the dry remains of the forgotten, he aided the destitute in times of urgency. Though Prince Shaoling repeatedly sent invitations, Qianzhi refused to meet him. When the prince’s envoys arrived at his residence, he would occasionally encounter them and generously bestow gifts.

It further states: Zhang Xuanche, styled Wenju, was a native of Yiyang Commandery in Sizhou. At the end of the Liang, when great chaos reigned, he followed others eastward to eke out a living and preserve his life. Yet he always shared a pot with the starving, cooking together. Xuanche was kind and yielding, never putting himself first. He constantly pushed the cauldron toward others, letting them take precedence. Even when there was but a handful of cooked food, he always ate last, doing so day after day. Gradually, he grew weak and emaciated, and one day, he passed away. Because he had always put others before himself, he was reborn in a better existence.

It further states: Chu Ya, styled Xuantong, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery. At the end of the Liang, he lived in reclusion on Mount Juqu. He valued giving and disdained wealth, tirelessly aiding others. When his fields yielded a harvest, he gave the grain to the poor. Living among others, he always rose early to sweep and fetch water, ensuring all were provided for, even gathering firewood for beggars. In summer, he planted melons and allowed people to take them freely.

It further states: Zhang Min, styled Gaoming, was a native of Xuancheng. He planted pines and oaks, and whatever was left or given to him, he kept nothing, especially delighting in bestowing alms. He accumulated no wealth, dispersing whatever he received as soon as he obtained it. Whenever he encountered perilous situations or places where prohibited items were found, or when fellow travelers faced public or private obstacles they could not overcome, Min would find a way to carry them through, ensuring their safe passage. On the night of ascending the altar, when the cold was bitter and severe, Min bared his left hand to hold the candle, enduring until dawn without slackening. Whenever he attended others’ rituals, he personally performed menial tasks, sweeping away filth and exerting all his strength.

In the heat, he would yield his curtains and canopy; in the cold, he would offer his clothing and bedding.

Volume Thirteen states: Meng Daoyang, styled Xiaoyuan and also known as Yuan externally, was a native of Pingchang. His nature was kind and benevolent, and he devoted himself entirely to almsgiving. During years of famine, many starved to death, so he frequently prepared food to distribute. He often lamented his poverty, for it prevented him from giving as generously as he wished.

Volume Fourteen states: Sun Youyue, styled Xuanda, was a native of Yongkang in Dongyang. He diligently guided and received disciples, and those who reverently studied under him numbered in the hundreds.

It further states: The Twin Masters of Discourse were men of the Liang dynasty. They abstained from grains, observed prolonged fasts, and practiced asceticism. They traveled to Guangzhou to propagate the teachings, and the people of Nanhai regarded them as their masters.

It further states: Xu Mingye, a native of Chigang in Fufeng, lived during the Taiqing era of the Liang dynasty. He left home in his youth, observed a strict vegetarian diet, and wandered through mountains and rivers, dedicating himself to relief and salvation. During a time of famine when the people suffered hardship, Mingye constantly provided aid. He ensured that all who came received food and drink. Leading his disciples, he tilled the fields and sowed seeds. When the rice and millet were nearly ripe, he traveled near and far, summoning the poor to harvest according to their strength. If he encountered someone suffering from cold, he would remove his own clothes to give them. In the depths of winter, he wore only a single layer of cloth. Whenever he entered the city to perform meritorious deeds, whatever he received he immediately distributed to the needy, never carrying anything out through the city gates. If someone was ill, he would forgo all other meritorious deeds, employing every expedient means to attend to them, for he believed that without his care, their lives would not be preserved. If he visited a household and suddenly departed in haste, it was certain that misfortune or disaster would befall that place.

Volume Fifteen states: Lu Yichong, styled Jingyou, was a native of Yangdu in Haiguan. From a young age, he was deeply devoted to the Daoist teachings. In his interactions with others, he treated the noble and the humble with equal regard. Skilled in comforting the masses, he became a refuge for those near and far.

It further states: Zou Rong, styled Wenhui, was a native of Zhang’an in Linhai. He left home in his youth and was diligent in his duties. He treated all without partiality.

Volume Sixteen states: Yin Zhongkan, a native of Chenjun, served as Senior Attendant to the Crown Prince. From his youth, he revered the Heavenly Master Dao, receiving both the *zhihi* and *Zhengyi* ordinations. He served the teachings with devotion, sparing no wealth. When illness struck his household, he personally inscribed talismans, and they often proved efficacious. When villagers or attendants sought his aid, he would promptly provide relief, bringing no small benefit.

Volume Eighteen states: Deng Yuzhi, styled Xuanda, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. He once dreamed of a crow that spat out a seal and gave it to him. Thereafter, whenever the common folk fell ill, he would treat and heal them with the seal alone, without inscribing talismans, and the afflicted would recover of their own accord.

It further states: Zhuge Lin, styled Maolun, was a native of Langye. Devoted to the Dao, he maintained purity and often fasted to aid others in illness. When treating others or himself, he took no medicine or herbs, drinking only consecrated water, and none failed to recover. During the *Taiyuan* era, Lin’s eyelids suddenly developed growths. He sought water from the Daoist sanctuary to wash them, and after a few days, they gradually healed.

It further states: Puyang—of unknown origin—served the Dao with single-minded devotion, and his prayers were always efficacious. A girl surnamed Zheng, whose given name sounds like *ti* and who suffered from a lame foot, came to him to wash her foot with the consecrated water. The remainder was poured onto a withered jujube tree in the courtyard, and the tree revived while her foot simultaneously healed. After Emperor Jianwen of Jin deposed the heir apparent and later had no sons, Puyang was then in the palace and secretly offered prayers. At the third watch, a yellow *qi* arose from the southwest and descended directly into the chamber. That night, Empress Dowager Li conceived Emperor Xiaowu—such was the power of the unseen Dao.

Volume Twenty states: Ji Huiyan, a native of Yuhang in Wuxing, left home in her youth to become a *bhikṣuṇī*, later renouncing her vows to become a Daoist nun. She then resided on Mount Tianmu, practicing grain avoidance and consuming medicinal foods. Whenever someone fell gravely ill, she would administer a talisman, and all were instantly cured.

*The Upper Register of Immortals* records: At the foot of Mount Tai, an old man named Shifu sold medicines in the marketplace. He claimed to be three hundred years old. When a pestilence later struck and tens of thousands perished, the prefect visited Shifu to seek aid. Shifu carried a vermilion banner and distributed yellow powder through the stricken quarters; all who drank it recovered, numbering in the tens of thousands.

*The Lower Register of Immortals* records: Chang Rong, a Daoist of Mount Chang, called herself a daughter of the Yin king. She ate the roots of *penglei* (creeping fig), and though she was seen by many over two hundred years, her complexion remained that of a woman of twenty. She gathered purple grass, sold it to dyers, and gave the money to orphans and widows. This she did for generations, and ten thousand households came to venerate her.

*The Third Scroll of the Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Shen Xi, a man of Wu Commandery, studied the Dao in Shu. He could only dispel misfortune, cure illnesses, and aid the common people.

The Fourth Scroll records: Huang Luzi, surnamed Ge and named Yue, treated illness by having patients from a thousand *li* away send their names to him; all were cured without his ever seeing them in person.

Volume Five records: Shen Jian, a native of Danyang, was skilled in healing. No matter how severe the illness, all who met him recovered.

The Eighth Scroll records: Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a man of Poyang. He practiced healing with unfailing success, yet performed no sacrifices, used no talismanic water, needles, or medicines. When treating illness, he would simply spread an eight-foot cloth on the ground and sit upon it, neither eating nor drinking. In a moment, the patient would recover, and he would depart. If malevolent spirits caused harm, Yao would draw a prison on the ground, summon them aloud, and their forms—foxes, raccoon dogs, or serpents—would appear within. He would then slay and burn them, and the afflicted would immediately recover.

The Ninth Scroll records: Li Changzai, a man of Shu Commandery, tended to the critically ill and cured them in three days; those less afflicted recovered in a single day. If a case was incurable, he would not attend to it.

It further states: There was a man named Gan Jun, a native of Beihai. He had suffered from leprosy for decades, and no medicine could cure him. One day, he saw an old medicine vendor in the market named Bo He and went to inquire of him. The old man said, "Your illness can be treated. If you truly wish to recover, come to the northern side of the great bridge beneath the magnolia tree at the crowing of the rooster tomorrow, and I shall teach you." The next day, Gan Jun arrived at the appointed place at cockcrow, only to find Bo He already there. The old man grew angry and said, "Do you not wish to be cured? Why have you come late?" He then set a new time for the middle of the night the following day. Thus, Gan Jun arrived at the appointed place at sunset and waited. After a moment, the old man appeared. Gan Jun asked, "Is this not the proper time?" The old man then handed him two volumes of plain script, admonishing him, "With these books, you will not only recover from your illness but attain longevity." Gan Jun bowed twice and received the books. The old man further instructed, "Return home and copy these books until you have one hundred and fifty volumes." Gan Jun pondered their meaning and, applying their teachings inwardly to cultivate his body and nurture his nature, and outwardly to dispel calamities and heal illnesses, found that none failed to be cured. He lived among the people for over three hundred years before achieving the Dao and ascending as an immortal.

*The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* records: The True Man of the Southern Peak and Left Immortal Duke, Supreme Perfected Lord of Grand Void, surnamed Chi and named Zhongying, initially studied the Dao on Mount Jinhua. Suddenly, he fell gravely ill and remained so for sixteen years. The Azure Lad bestowed upon him the *Scripture of Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*, and by reciting it three thousand times while aiding his condition, he fully recovered.

*The Seventh Scroll of Daoist Biographies* states: Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Dongqian in Wuxing. In the seventh year of the Dashizu era of the Song, when Emperor Ming fell ill, Master Lu led the assembly in performing the Three Primes Open-Air Fast for the state’s prayers. On the twentieth day, clouds gathered, winds rose sharply, and a light rain dampened the dust. At the second watch, a yellow qi resembling a precious canopy suddenly ascended from below before the hall, rising some ten zhang in height. It spread over the steps and courtyard for several moments, transforming into five colors that illuminated the eaves and beams. After lingering for a long while, it suddenly revolved and ascended to the scripture platform, where it dispersed and vanished. Over a hundred people who witnessed the fast all saw this, and the event was reported to the emperor, whose illness improved. It was deemed an auspicious sign.

It further states: Meng Jingyi, styled Fuming, was a native of Anqiu in Pingchang. When Prince Jingling of Liang obtained a set of *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*, he casually tossed them aside. Soon after, his hands broke out in carbuncles, causing excruciating pain. He then sent Master Feng to offer apologies. The master composed a repentance text, expressing deep remorse, and though Meng’s condition slightly improved, he ultimately died from this affliction.

The Eighteenth Scroll records: Lou Anle was a native of Qiaoguo. His wife, née Fu, had suffered from wind sores for over a decade, and despite countless treatments, none proved effective. She devoted herself solely to the Daoist gate, hoping for deliverance. In the seventh year of the Yuanjia era of the Song, during a violent storm, the roof of Lou Anle’s elder brother’s house collapsed. Fearing her own home would also cave in and crush her, Fu rushed into the central courtyard, forgetting her foot ailment. Thereupon, her condition returned to normal, a result of her faith in the Dao. How could medicine alone be relied upon?

*The Scripture of the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates* states: The immortal Zhao Chengzi consumed five minerals, which erupted from his body, and he died on Mount Xuan in Shanggu, Youzhou. Six years later, a traveler passing through the mountains saw his rotting corpse with the stones exposed in his abdomen. The traveler took and swallowed them, then departed. Four or five years later, the stones flew out and returned to the mouth of the former corpse, which then revived, its face radiating jade-like light. The Five Elder Immortals gnashed their teeth in rebuke at this thief of the five viscera’s treasures. This leper-faced man—his face afflicted with leprosy—would, upon reaching the first gate, suffer leprosy of varying severity, leading to the death of his entire clan.

*The First Scripture of Divine Incantations* states: Blue qi portends sudden death; red qi, swelling and illness; yellow qi, dysentery; white qi, cholera; black qi, official misfortune. The Red-Headed Ghost wields these qi to spread across the world, slaying the wicked.

*The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* records: Cui Wenzhi—*The Biographies of the Immortals* states he was a native of Taishan—healed the sick with medicines at the foot of Mount Tai. Chi Jun, who had been ill on Mount Jinhua for sixteen years, later recovered from his wind affliction and attained the Dao.

*The Fifth Declaration of Perfected Realities* states: Wind afflictions arise from the dampness and stagnation of the three springs in the yin of hills and graves. Thus, the Earth Officials, through the clashing of water and qi, often produce wind impediment. In severe cases, the entire body becomes unresponsive; in milder cases, half the body or the loss of hands and feet occurs. If one frequently dreams of the northeast or northwest, passing through former dwellings or seeing spirit groves, it is precisely because one is encountering the qi of tombs. The northeast of a grave slightly severs life, while the northwest is the Nine Perils, both inauspicious grounds for tomb disputes. If one sees the deceased there, it is surely a sign. For those who frequently have such dreams, upon waking, face upward, tap the teeth three times, and recite the following incantation:

*"Supreme Primordial, Purple Heaven of the Nine Capitals,
Regulate the hun-soul, protect life,
Lofty and Pure True Person,
I receive the supreme method, the teachings of Grand Mystery,
To attain long life and enduring vision,
Body soaring, form immortal,
Tombs eternally at peace,
Ghostly disputes and treachery sealed,
Hun and po harmonious and joyful,
Evil qi dispelled,
Specters and shadowy beings,
Dare not offend my spirit.
The Northern Emperor strikes and subdues,
Gathering the qi into the abyss,
Recorded in the registers of the Supreme August,
Respectfully reported to the Jade Dawn."*

Recite this twice, then tap the teeth three more times, and one will no longer dream of tombs or deceased family ghosts. For those who frequently have inauspicious dreams, this method may also be applied. Thus, ghostly qi will vanish, and malevolent spirits will scatter.

Moreover, it is said: When the arms fail to respond, it is because stagnant wind-toxin qi has settled in the meridians, congealing upon the bones and causing numbness. Acupuncture and moxibustion should be applied, for these will bring cure. It is also fitting to invoke the Northern Emperor with the "Prayer of Bending and Turning." If performed a hundred times, the affliction will likewise dissipate.

First, slowly massage the afflicted arm with one hand for a long while, then close the eyes and inwardly visualize. Swallow saliva three times, tap the teeth three rounds, compose the mind, and softly intone:

"Supreme Four Mysteries, Five Flowers and Six Courts,
Three *hun*-souls and seven *po*-souls,
Celestial Pass and Earthly Essence,
Divine Palace and Protective Guardians,
Heavenly Womb and Lofty Clarity,
The hundred spirits of the four limbs,
The myriad numina of the nine joints—
Receive the registers of Jade Dawn,
Inscribed in the Jade City.
Jade maidens attend my body,
Jade lads guard my life.
Ever aligned with the Two Radiant Ones,
I ascend as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
My years enduring with sun and moon.
Later, I shall soar beyond, attaining the Great Peace.
Yet now, flowing wind and congealed infirmity,
Possessing ghosts and five flying [demons],
*Wangliang* and tomb-qi,
Yin-qi lingering and encroaching,
Assail my four limbs,
Offend my flourishing and decline.
Supreme Celestial Ding,
Dragon and Tiger display their might,
Slaying inauspicious ghosts,
Crushing wind and malevolence.
Examine and restrain hidden disputes,
Concealed poisons and hidden wrongs,
Restore me to my former state,
My radiance equal to sun and moon.
Should any dare to test me,
The Northern Star shall seize and shatter them,
Defying the luminous majesty above."

In ancient times, Tang Lan dwelled in the forests of Linlü Mountain when he was struck by a ghost, leaving his entire body unresponsive, as if wrapped in silk floss. A Daoist taught him this method, and his affliction was immediately dispelled. This is the "Bending and Turning" method of the Northern Emperor. For all ailments involving bending and turning, this method is excellent—not merely for wind-numbness and unresponsiveness.

Tang Lan now resides on Mount Hua, having obtained the *Hongdan* method and achieved immortality through its practice. Zheng Zizhen was the grandson of Kangcheng. Now dwelling on Mount Yangdi, he once suffered for years from unresponsive legs. In his later years, he combined acupuncture and moxibustion with the "Bending and Turning" prayer, and within a hundred days, his ailment was entirely cured.

The onset of wind and *kao*-qi occurs through gaps in weakened qi. When the body is deficient, illness invades. If one recovers and truly reduces frivolous exertions, wind-infirmities will surely be dispelled. Now, to restrain and control the qi of tomb-infestations, one may also present the "Tomb Dispute Petition," which I shall submit on your behalf. Thus, the infesting qi will be severed.

Formerly, Deng Yunshan, having attained the Dao, suddenly found both hands unresponsive. I sent word instructing him to apply moxibustion to *Fenghui* and *Qujin*. Within six or seven days, he could perform the "Five Animals Exercise." After the acupuncture is complete, one should focus on the moxibustion sites and inwardly circulate the Dao, which is no different from physical practice.

In the past, Lord Zhao Cheng’s legs dragged, leaving him unable to rise. Morning and night, he constantly visualized bowing to the Supreme. After thirty years, the Supreme True Person bestowed upon him a dose of *Liu Ming Tan Huan* powder. Immediately, he could stand and walk, and later attained the Dao. He now resides beneath Mount Heming.

It is further said: Upon waking at night, visualize the solar orb grasped in the afflicted hand. Let the sun’s crimson rays reverse from the arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the rays transform into fire, burning the arm until it is thoroughly permeated inside and out. When this is complete, silently intone:

"Fourfold Clarity of the Upper Origin,
Qi of sun and moon divided,
Flowing light resplendent,
Irrigating the soul with congealed essence.
Divine fire scatters radiance,
Purging filth and refining vapors,
Permeating wind-qi,
Burning away the hundred evils.
Grant me long life,
My four limbs whole.
Infesting *kao*-ghosts and harming qi,
Consigned to the Northern Star."

For students of the Dao, one must first treat illness, ensuring the body is free of vacuous evil, blood deficiency, brain depletion, or stagnant and turbid fluids. Without first treating illness, even the ingestion of medicinals and circulation of qi will bring no benefit to the body.

Formerly, the Daoist Wang Zhongfu, from his youth, was devoted to the affairs of divine immortals. For over forty years, he practiced the "Absorbing the Two Radiant Ones and Feeding on Clouds" method, yet perceived no benefit. His son also practiced it for eighteen years before ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Later, the True Person of Southern Marchmount descended and instructed Zhongfu: "The reason you have not attained transcendence is that your body suffers from grave illness—your brain palace is depleted, sinew fluids unmoistened, and numinous essences unsurging. Though you connect with true radiance and feed on clouds, it has not benefited your body."

Zhongfu then treated his illness with medicinals while continuing his practice. After another eighteen years, he too ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now on the Dark Continent, he received scriptures and became the True Person of the Central Marchmount, presiding over the Nine Mysteries. He remains there to this day.

*The Oral Instructions of the Phoenix Net* states: When a Daoist falls ill, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the heart generating fire to burn the body. Maintain this visualization until the essence is as if tangible, and illness will be cured. This is the method of "storing fire in pain," most secret and efficacious.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll Seven* records: Li Zheng, before entering the mountains, also suffered from wind-numbness, which persisted for a long time before he recovered.

It further states: Fan Bocai of Guiyang was originally a layman, but suddenly fell victim to madness, demonic possession, and consumptive illness. He lay bedridden for years, and though his family summoned masters to resolve the matter, their expenses depleted his wealth, yet his illness remained uncured. Hearing that the Great Dao was pure and simple, requiring nothing, his resolve changed. Learning that Shen Jing had become a diligent Daoist with proven success in treating illness, he abandoned his family and worldly affairs. After fifty days, his illness was entirely cured. Later, he entered Mount Tianmu, consumed sesame, and became the True Person of Primordial Unity.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll Eight* records: Formerly, Bao Zhu of Jibei suddenly suffered from whirling wind. His mouth and eyes became crooked, wind-qi entered his mouth, and his upper and lower teeth incessantly gnashed with loud clattering, day and night without cease. He lived to the age of one hundred twenty-seven.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll Nine* records: Yang Xi’s third daughter recently suffered from consumptive decline; though she has lately improved somewhat, she still has not ventured outside.

It further states: Xu Yufu remarked that Academician Yang’s younger brother was gravely ill and utterly weakened.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll Ten* records: Xu Que, styled Xiyuan, was the Marquis of Jindu Township. Later, he suffered from wind-illness and lost the power of speech. He died in the second year of the Long’an era at the age of seventy.

*The Transmission of Daoist Learning, Scroll Four* records: During a great epidemic, the people rushed to Wu Meng to beg for water. Meng, troubled by the incessant demands, drew water from the river a hundred paces away, allowing them to take it as they wished. All who received the water were cured.

It further states: The Daoist Shu Daoyun had suffered from malaria for three years, and no treatment had brought relief. Wu Meng taught him the *Three Sovereigns’ Poems* and instructed him to recite them aloud. As soon as he began, his illness was instantly cured.

It further records: Dai Ganlu suffered from a loathsome disease and was exiled to the coastal regions. Yun Mingzheng declared, “This can be cured.” After several days of treatment, he was fully restored.

It further states: The Prefectural Administrator Kang Hou of great wealth had a daughter who had been ill for years. Despite consulting countless physicians and invoking every Daoist method, her condition only worsened. Yun Mingzheng arrived at his gate and declared, “I can cure your daughter.” Kang Hou, filled with arrogance, refused to receive him. Having encountered many who claimed mastery of arts yet failed to deliver results, and seeing Mingzheng in tattered clothes and barefoot, he dismissed him as a madman and did not believe him. Mingzheng insisted he could cure long-standing ailments and requested to see the daughter. The Prefect grew furious, for his daughter’s illness had persisted so long that no one could have restored her. Suddenly, the daughter asked her household, “Who wishes to see me?” She then dressed herself, put on her shoes, and emerged, adorned and composed. The Prefect was astonished. Mingzheng said, “The young lady is already cured. She may return inside.” Only then did the entire household begin to acknowledge his divine efficacy.

Scroll Four further records: Ren Dun, styled Shang, possessed the ability to heal illnesses. Those afflicted with the most severe and incurable diseases, abandoned by all hope of recovery, received his treatment and were invariably saved. Such cases were numerous. He spoke little, though when he did, he would foretell future fortunes or misfortunes, and all came to pass as he said. When asked about an illness, if he replied, “There is no suffering; it is not life-threatening,” the patient would surely recover. If he remained silent, none could be saved.

It further states: Du Jiong, styled Zigong, was skilled in healing illnesses and could foresee the good and evil among people. Long Zhi of Shangyu and Si Shen of Qiantang, both shamans, envied Jiong’s mastery of the Dao and constantly slandered him. When informed of this, Jiong said, “To slander the true Dharma is to soon invite karmic retribution.” Shortly after, Zhi’s wife died suddenly, and Shen was stricken with a hidden illness. Both repented and sought forgiveness. Jiong performed rites to absolve them, and they were instantly cured. Later, Shen fell ill again. Jiong said, “You harbor ghostly objects, which is why the qi haunts you.” Shen confessed, “I indeed hid a chest of fine clothes.” Jiong retrieved and burned them, and Shen’s illness vanished at once.

It further records: Wang Xizhi fell ill and summoned Du Jiong. Jiong said to his disciples, “Wang Youjun’s illness will not be cured. What need has he for me?” More than ten days later, Wang passed away.

It further states: When Lu Na served as Minister of Works at the age of forty, he suffered from sores. He told Jiong, “My family has been short-lived for generations, and all have died afflicted by these sores.” Jiong submitted a memorial to the heavens on his behalf and gave him the *Divine Flying Powder*. He said, “Your destined hardship has passed. You will live to seventy.” And so it came to be.

Scroll Five records: An Qiu [missing character], styled Zhongdu, was a native of Changling in Jingzhao during the reign of Emperor Cheng. Gravely ill, his disciples placed him beneath a tree in the courtyard. An Qiu suddenly awoke, fully recovered. It was winter, yet he smelled the fragrance of plums. Opening his eyes, he saw two red plums hanging from a withered branch. His disciple Du reached up to catch them, and the plums fell into his palm. An Qiu ate them, and all his suffering vanished. His body felt light, his vision clear. He then departed with Du, and none knew where they went.

It further states: Guo Wen, styled Wenju, was a native of Henan. Stricken by a severe epidemic, he endured great suffering but refused medicine, saying, “My fate does not depend on medicine.” He fasted for over twenty days yet did not grow emaciated. Later, he passed away and was buried in Lin’an County of Yuhang.

It further records: Liu Ningzhi, styled Zhi’an, with the childhood name Changnian, was a native of Zhijiang in Nanjun. From a young age, he suffered from frailty, dizziness, and confusion, and his condition worsened over the years.

Scroll Seven records: Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Dongqian in Wuxing during the Song dynasty. He secluded himself in Yunmeng Mountain to cultivate the Dao. While briefly descending to seek medicine, he passed through his hometown and stayed with his family for several days. Suddenly, his daughter fell gravely ill, her life hanging by a thread. His family urgently begged him to save her. The Master sighed and said, “I have long severed ties with wife and children, entrusting my body to the profound Dao. My return home is like staying at an inn—how could I still harbor attachment?” With that, he brushed his sleeves and departed without a backward glance. The day after he left, his daughter’s illness was cured.

It further states: Xiujing had long suffered from a qi ailment. Carrying medicine, he entered the mountains and stayed in a separate chamber. Soon after, it was engulfed in flames. His disciples rushed to extinguish the fire, but the Master said, “There is no need to save it. This is the will of the unseen realm, forbidding me to keep the medicine. My illness will soon be cured on its own.” Within days, he recovered.

Scroll Eight records: Gu Huan, styled Xuanping, also styled Jingyi, was a native of Wu in Wu Commandery. The village of Baishan was plagued by malevolent illnesses. The villagers pleaded for his help. Huan went to the village and lectured on the *Laozi*, drawing the hells upon the ground. After a while, foxes, badgers, turtles, and alligators entered the depicted hells in great numbers, and the afflicted were all cured.

Scroll Ten records: Fang Qianzhi, styled Daochong, was a native of Baixian in Zhaojun, Jizhou. From a young age, he abstained from alcohol and never held a cup in his hands until his old age. Though he fell ill, he never took medicine or underwent acupuncture, entrusting his life and death to fate while aiding others.

It further states: Zhang Xuanche, styled Wenju, was a native of Yiyang Commandery. While discussing matters with his fellow villager Zhang Guisun, Guisun suddenly suffered a wind-induced illness and could not rise or move. Xuanche abandoned his studies to personally care for him, handling filthy vessels, overseeing meals, and tending to his needs for three years without complaint. The people of his time admired his loyalty and resolve.

Scroll Twelve records: Jia Leng, styled Xuanmiao, was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery. In his youth, he became a Buddhist monk but returned to secular life after encountering bandits. Later in life, he embraced the Dao and debated right and wrong with various Daoists. In his old age, he fell ill, his lips and teeth failing to close, his speech impeded, hindering his access to the wondrous gate. The Dharma Seat sighed, “This illness of mine must have been brought on by offending the Dao. Much of what I have written has been lost.”

Scroll Fifteen records: Huan Kai, styled Yanshu, was a native of Dantu in Donghai. At the beginning of the Liang dynasty, three ancient lacquered bamboo containers were found in the Kunlun Mountains, amid the level sands of an islet. Inside were three copies of the *Scripture of Great Peace*, written on yellow silk and transmitted by Lord Gan.

The villagers marveled, and widely established quiet offerings at the scripture’s place of origin. Huan Kai then requested a copy from the villagers to take back to the capital for veneration. He first presented it to Lord Tao, who declared, “This is indeed the ancient text of Lord Gan.” Upon hearing that the scripture was to be brought to the capital, he fell gravely ill with malaria, and no treatment could cure him. Tao Hongjing, styled Zhenbai, heard of this and said, “This illness is not mine to fear—it must be the scripture’s retribution. Why not return it to its original place?” Following his advice, the scripture was sent back, and the illness was cured.

Scroll Sixteen records: Kong Lingchan, styled Lingchan, was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. When his mother passed away, he observed mourning with such filial devotion that he abstained from wine and delicacies, living on gruel, vegetables, and plain cloth for the rest of his life. His father, unaware of this, was in the capital. Later, when Lingchan went to the capital to pay his respects, his father saw his emaciated state and, moved with pity, ordered the kitchen to prepare fine dishes and shared them with him. Though Lingchan obeyed his father’s kindness and forced himself to eat, he fell ill as a result. His father, recognizing his innate nature could not be changed, did not press him further.

Scroll Nineteen records: Emperor Ming of Qi fell ill and often summoned the monastic assembly to the inner palace to perform Daoist rites. Upon hearing the recitation of scriptures by Yan Zhiming, styled Huishi, a Daoist from Jinling among the assembly, he felt great admiration and delight, saying his illness was eased. After the ritual concluded and Zhiming returned outside, the emperor could not rest at night. He issued an edict summoning Zhiming to recite before him, and upon doing so, he felt joy and relief. The emperor then granted him an imperial carriage and oxen, and whenever he traveled, he was received with honor by both Daoists and laypeople.

Scroll Twenty records: During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Liang, his heir, Fang Deng, fell gravely ill. His consort, Lady Xu, purified her heart and body and sent someone to the female attendant Li Lingcheng at the Hualin Lodge to perform meritorious deeds. That night, the consort dreamed of two young attendants in blue, their appearance and attire unlike ordinary beings, who called themselves the Hualin Attendants. They were sent to inform her that the illness would be cured if a stone from the altar were retrieved and returned. Upon waking, she asked the heir, who said, “Recently, I had a stone taken from the mountain pool for use and sent it back.” He then sent his tutor, Wang Xiaosi, into the mountains to hold a fast and repent, and the heir recovered.

*The Fourth Scroll of the Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Those afflicted with illness sought healing from Sun Bo of Hedong. Bo did nothing extraordinary—he merely pointed at them, and they were cured.

Scroll Seven records: Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was a native of Houguan. During the reign of the former Lord of Wu, he returned to reside at the foot of Mount Lu in Yuzhang. A man who had suffered from leprosy since youth, on the verge of death, carried himself to Feng and kowtowed, begging for mercy. Feng had the man sit in a room, covering his eyes with five layers of cloth and instructing him not to move. He ordered his household to keep away. The man later recounted hearing something licking him, the pain unbearable, as if rain fell upon every part of him. He estimated the creature’s tongue to be about a foot wide, its breath as large as an ox’s, yet he never saw what it was. After a long while, the creature departed. Feng then removed the blindfold, bathed the man, and sent him away, saying, “You are cured now—just avoid the wind.” Within ten days, the man’s body turned entirely red, his skin gone, and the pain was severe, though bathing in water eased it. After twenty days, new skin grew, and his sores healed, leaving his flesh smooth as congealed fat.

It is also said: Feng lived in the mountains without farming. Though he healed people’s illnesses, he accepted no money or goods. Instead, he asked those cured of serious illnesses to plant five apricot trees for him, and those with minor ailments to plant one. Over several years, the apricot trees numbered in the tens of thousands, forming a lush forest.

Scroll Nine records: Gui Jun was the governor of Xuzhou. He had suffered from leprosy for ten years, and no physician could cure him. Hearing that Lord Gan possessed the Dao, he went to see him. He arrived with hundreds of attendants, their presence imposing. Yet when he reached the gate, Lord Gan did not come out to greet him, and upon entering the room, Lord Gan did not rise. Gui Jun bowed and explained himself. Lord Gan asked, “Why have you come?” Gui Jun replied, “I suffer from this grave illness and seek healing from a divine being.” Lord Gan said, “With so many attendants, I thought you came to rob the Dao. If you truly wish to be cured, send away your retinue and stay to tend the horses—then you may be healed.” Gui Jun dismissed his officials and remained to care for the horses. After three years, he still received no treatment, unaware that his illness had already been cured.

It is also said: Lord Mao studied the Dao in Qi and later attained it, residing on Mount Mao. When people with illnesses came to seek his help, he would ask them to boil ten eggs and place them inside his curtain. After a moment, Lord Mao would toss each egg back to them. If, upon breaking them, the yolks were missing, the person would recover. If the yolks contained soil, the illness would persist. This became his customary method, and the eggs remained unbroken as before.

Scroll Ten records: Feng Junda was a native of Longxi. Whenever he heard of someone, whether known to him or not, on the verge of death from illness, he would treat them with medicine, and they would recover at his touch.

It is also said: Zhao Qu, styled Zirong, was a native of Shangdang. He contracted leprosy and was near death. Someone told his family, “You must abandon him while he is still alive. If he dies at home, this disease will afflict your descendants for generations.” Thus, his family prepared a year’s worth of provisions and sent him to a stone chamber deep in the mountains. Fearing wild beasts, they barricaded the entrance with firewood. Qu, grieving and resentful, wept day and night. After over a hundred days, he suddenly saw three figures before the stone chamber and asked who they were. Qu replied, “I am a destitute man.” Realizing that no one would venture into such a remote mountain forest, he knew they must be divine beings. He knelt and pleaded, recounting his plight. The divine beings entered through the firewood as if passing through mist, untouched by any obstruction. They asked, “If you truly wish to be cured, are you willing to take medicine?”

Qu replied, “I am unworthy and full of wickedness. With this vile affliction, I have already been cast aside, death but a dawn or dusk away. If severing my feet or slicing off my nose could restore my life, I would gladly endure it—how much more so with mere medicine! I only beg the divine beings to grant me survival.”

The divine beings then bestowed upon him five *dou* each of pine seeds and pine resin. They instructed, “Consuming this will not only cure your illness but enable you to transcend the world. When you finish this, your disease will be healed—yet do not cease after recovery.”

Qu had not yet finished the medicine when his leprosy vanished entirely, his body growing robust and strong. He returned home, but his family took him for a ghost. Only after he recounted all that had transpired did they rejoice. He continued the regimen for two years, his complexion growing youthful, his skin luminous, his speed rivaling that of a flying bird.

It is further said: Elder Chen has dwelled on Zhu Yu Peak for six hundred and sixty years. The people of Zhu Yu Peak built him a hut and offer sacrifices in each of the four seasons. Yet the Elder consumes neither food nor drink, nor engages in any cultivation. For all matters, those who serve him—when afflicted by illness—beg for sacrificial water from the Elder in a vessel, and upon drinking it, are cured. Those fated to die, however, the Elder does not grant water.

*Note: Zhu Yu (纻藇) is pronounced "yú."*

The *Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Three, states:
A Perfected One asked, “Why do ordinary people suffer frequent illnesses?”

The Perfected One answered: “When the spirit of the liver departs and does not return in due time, the eyes lose their brightness. When the spirit of the heart departs, the lips turn pale. When the spirit of the lungs departs, the nose becomes blocked. When the spirit of the kidneys departs, the ears grow deaf. When the spirit of the spleen departs, the mouth cannot taste sweetness. When the spirit of the head departs, one becomes dizzy and disoriented. When the spirit of the abdomen departs, the center of the belly falls into great disorder, and nothing can be transformed. When the spirits of the four limbs depart, one cannot move on one’s own. The nature of the spirit and essence is to dwell in quiet and secluded places, not in defiled and turbid ones. If one wishes to recall the spirits, one must fast and maintain purity, hang their images in a fragrant chamber, and all illnesses will vanish. Without fasting and purity, the spirits will not return to the person, and all will ascend to heaven to accuse them. Thus, people’s illnesses accumulate, and the dead do not cease.”

*Scroll Forty-Five of the Scripture of Great Peace* further states: “Heaven does not resent people having dwellings, but resents them digging too deeply into the earth, causing wounds. Some obtain the earth’s bones, some its blood. Springs are the earth’s blood, and stones are its bones. The earth is humanity’s mother; recklessly piercing one’s mother causes her to suffer grief and pain, so people are often sick and short-lived. When digging into the earth, one should not go deeper than three feet. The first foot belongs to the yang qi, which is of heaven. The second foot belongs to the qi of living things, which is of harmony. The third foot reaches the earth’s own qi, which is of yin. Beyond this lies injury to the earth’s form, and all is inauspicious. In ancient times, people relied on mountain valleys and caves, not erecting beams and pillars, so they fell ill less often. Later generations excessively harmed the earth, so they suffer more illnesses.”

It is further asked: “Nowadays, some live near flowing water and do not dig wells, yet they still fall ill and die young. Why is this?” The answer: “This is because heaven and earth are already angered by their northern neighbors, who bear the burden of one another’s faults, like a family where one member’s transgression affects their siblings. Thus, digging into the earth to obtain water—water being the earth’s blood vessels—how could one not fall ill?”

It is further asked: “Some people do not disturb the earth, yet when they build a dwelling, misfortune befalls them at once. Why is this?” The answer: “Such people act at inauspicious times, offending the spirits and inviting misfortune.” Asked, “Which spirits do they offend?” The answer: “Spirits are not one but many; one need not seek their names.”

It is further asked: “Some dig into the earth yet encounter good fortune and no illness. Why is this?” The answer: “There is always harm, but if one obtains good earth, the harm does not manifest immediately. Over time, it will still afflict people. If one obtains bad earth, illness strikes at once. Thus, great earthworks bring great misfortune, and small ones bring minor misfortune—this is the earth’s wrath, causing spirits to inflict these disasters and make people ill.”

It is further asked: “Now, when building dwellings in low-lying fields near rivers and seas, where no pillars or beams are needed, and water is found before digging three feet deep, what should be done?” The answer: “This is equally harmful. One should dig even shallower, for this is the earth’s thin skin, near its meridians. Just as a person with thick skin makes it hard to draw blood, which is still an injury, so too with thin skin: blood comes easily, but it is still an injury. The harm lies not in whether the skin is thick or thin, but in seeing blood, which is a transgression. People do not wish to be injured, so why would they wish to injure the earth and provoke its anger? Heaven and earth are humanity’s true origin, the father and mother of yin and yang. How can a child rightfully injure their parents?”

It is further asked: “Now, children receive sustenance from their mother, so people dig wells to drink. What fault is there in this?” The answer: “It is not so. People drink from their mother at the place where springs emerge. A mother’s milk is a person’s spring; just as the earth has water springs, one may drink from them. But how can one recklessly pierce their mother’s skin and drink her blood and fluids?”

*The Upper Scroll of the Perfect Writs* states: “For those gravely ill, the rescue rite is called the Rite of Righteous Fasting. For three days and nights, a person of high virtue serves as the fasting master, with five as attendants. Sincerity and joy are essential; those who have received the registers may also participate. Without joy and moral progress, one may not join the fast. Further, to rescue and release parents, teachers, lords, or fellow Daoists from great disasters and calamities, the fasting officials perform the Great Expiation Rite at an open-air altar, scattering their hair, smearing their foreheads with mud, and paying homage to the Thirty-Two Heavens. During the fast, they recite the *Zi-Wu Chapters* at midnight and noon. If their suffering is sincere, they will surely be moved. This follows the method of the *Fasting Rite of Liquid and Ashes*. Within the fasting hall, they light seven ancestral lamps to extend blessings, and five more lamps—one each at the well, stove, gate, and pavilion—to bring wisdom and fortune. Further, when the Dharma Master expounds the teachings, the assembled officials perform the rites with utmost sincerity, adhering to the proper order. If they do not fail the sick, the recipients will gradually recover. After three days of fasting, if there is evident efficacy, the master is granted thirty years of lifespan, and the attendants twenty, calculated by doubling the days of the fast.”

*Scroll One of the Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* concludes.
*Scroll Two of the Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* begins.

**On Frugality and Austerity**
*From the "Biographies of Daoist Scholars, Scroll Four" in the* Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns, *compiled by the Tang dynasty’s Master of the Vast Sea of Dao, Wang Xuanhe*

It is said: Fan Chai, a native of Langzhong in Baxi (or written as *Chai*), possessed an elegant and refined demeanor. He never spoke of omens or portents, remaining serene and desireless, silent throughout the day. He wove tattered cloth into a net with rope, wearing coarse garments just sufficient to cover his body. Winter or summer, he went barefoot, yet his skin never cracked. He slept little in all seasons, his flesh as smooth as a maiden’s, his countenance fair. When engaging others, he always smiled, and all who knew him respected and found peace in his presence.

In the fourteenth year of the Taiyuan reign of the Liu Song dynasty, he arrived in Jingzhou and dwelled at the tail of Fucheng Isle in Zhijiang County, Nanjun, amidst the reeds. Though he had a hut, it offered no shelter from wind or frost. His bed was made of mulberry branches, stuffed with straw, and beside it stood an empty bamboo basket and a clay jar. He carried these on a pole, resting his head upon them to sleep. Sometimes he would beg for food for ten days at a time, never tasting fine grains, wine, or delicacies—only coarse millet, vegetables, and broth. A single *sheng* of food would sustain him for over ten days. He walked swiftly and spoke rapidly; unless one listened with utmost attention, his words were nearly unintelligible. He often sat in quiet reverence, his demeanor unchanged whether before high or low. He never spoke to worldly nobles or honored men, kept his eyes closed to avoid hearing music, and often lay murmuring to himself. When asked, he would say, "King Jianwu has come." Moments later, he would resume, answering other questions in ways that defied comprehension.

It is also said: He owned not a single possession, his basket and jar always empty. From afar, his patched and multicolored robes, tattered hat, and decades-old garments appeared unclean, yet upon closer inspection, they were strangely fragrant and immaculate.

*Scroll Five* further records: Liu Ningzhi, styled Zhi’an and nicknamed Changnian, was a native of Zhijiang in Nanjun. He refused all gifts from nobles and officials, dividing his family’s wealth and property among his younger brothers and nephews. Emerging from the wilderness, he built a humble abode with his own hands, taking nothing he had not earned. He and his wife lived in shared austerity, finding contentment in hardship. Unconcerned with trivial matters, they would push a cart of beans into the marketplace, selling at whatever price the day offered. Whatever food remained after their needs, they gave to the poor. Even in famine, when they themselves went without grain, they never abandoned their principles.

His wife was the daughter of Guo Quan, the Prefect of Liangzhou, who had sent her off with lavish dowry. Ningzhi distributed it all among their relatives, giving until nothing remained, and his wife bore no resentment.

It is also said: Fond of mountains and rivers, he took his wife and children to cross cliffs and ridges, building a small thatched hut. His family followed, and none knew where they ultimately settled.

*Scroll Ten* records: Zong Chao of Dongxiang, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. When the Prince of Luling of the Liang dynasty built him halls and corridors, all were grand and resplendent, with ritual implements of exquisite craftsmanship. Yet the master’s own dwelling remained a thatched hut, unchanged. His clothing, bedding, and curtains were all simple and unadorned. He often sat upon a round, withered stump, its surface worn smooth by his knees. His straw hat and woven mat were threadbare and broken, yet he never replaced them.

It is also said: Yan Jizhi, styled Jingchu, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. He left his family to follow the Dao, eating only vegetables and wearing plain cloth, his body never covered by even an inch of silk.

*Scroll Eleven* records: Zhang Ze, styled Shi’he, was a native of Wu in Wu Commandery. Devoted to the Dao and its teachings, he drifted through the world, speaking or remaining silent as circumstances demanded. Though poor, he lived within his means, never troubled by his condition.

*Scroll Thirteen* records: Yu Chengxian, styled Chongguang, was a native of Yanling in Yingchuan. Well-versed in the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, he lived with purity and frugality, wearing plain cloth and a woven mat. For over forty years, he maintained a vegetarian fast, devoting himself to teaching and expounding the Dao.

It is also said: Meng Daoyang, styled Xiaoyuan and also known as Yuan, was a native of Pingchang. Naturally kind and benevolent, he clothed himself in plain garments and ate only vegetables, owning nothing beyond the essentials. Diligent in his practice, he never grew weary, performing rituals and prostrations regardless of cold or heat.

*Scroll Fifteen* records: Dai Sheng, styled Shirong, was a native of Qu’e in Jinling. He left home in his youth and, though impoverished, once worked under Liu Biao, a local official fond of hunting. Sheng abandoned this life to enter Maoshan.

*Scroll Sixteen* records: Kong Lingchan, styled Lingchan, was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. After his mother’s death, he renounced wine, meat, and delicacies, living on gruel, vegetables, and plain cloth for the rest of his life.

*Scroll Eighteen* records: Deng Yuzhi, styled Xuanda, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. He withdrew to Mount Nanyue, traveling alone and dwelling in no fixed abode. In cold and heat, he wore only tattered robes, never tying his hair after mourning. When his hair grew long, he cut it. He lived during the Yongming era.

The *Biographies of Immortals, Scroll One* states: You Bozi wore only a single garment in winter and a coarse coat in summer. His appearance changed year by year, and after decades, he appeared younger. No one could fathom his age.

The *Biographies of Divine Immortals, Scroll Four* states: Kong Yuan of Xuchang subsisted on *fuling* and pine nuts, wearing coarse clothes and eating simple fare.

Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Taiyang in Hedong. At 170 years old, he ate white stones and built a thatched hut by the mountainside. His clothes were tattered, so he sold firewood in the market to buy old garments. In winter, he wore only a single layer, his complexion ruddy, resting as if in the heat of summer after drinking wine.

**On Concealing Radiance**
From the *Lower Scripture of the Great Cavern*:
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, his form submerged in the Eight Mysteries, his radiance concealed within the Ten Thousand Sources. Vast and boundless, he pervades the unseen, his branches marked by rosy clouds. His divine splendor stirs outwardly, his *qi* suffuses the flaming isles. In harmony with the great transformation, he dwells in the primordial void. The vast emptiness embraces the strange, and form dissolves with the transient.

*Biographies of Daoist Scholars, Scroll Five* records: Dongfang Shuo, styled Manqian, was a native of Yanci in Pingyuan.

Purity in the Dao yet concealment in its traces, clarity in essence yet obscurity in its manifestations. As for those of far-reaching mind and expansive capacity, of vast talent and brilliant eloquence, of untrammeled erudition and mastery across all fields—such was his nature.

There was also Yan Junping, whose given name was Zun, a native of Shu Commandery. He would wear no garment not befitting the Way, consume no food not in accord with it. He often practiced divination in the market of Chengdu, earning a hundred coins daily—enough for his sustenance—whereupon he would close his shop, lower the curtain, and cultivate the Dao. Profound and unwavering, he never made frivolous displays nor pursued superficial virtue. Though long secluded, he never altered his resolve, never served in office, and passed away at home in his nineties.

**Scroll Six** records: Zhu Huikai, styled Zhiyuan, was a native of Wucheng in Wu Commandery. By nature, he dwelt in seclusion, ever practicing tranquility and inner refinement. He often cut off all travel and social visits. When asked how he could remain so reclusive, he replied: *"To speak of activity is to find even the Six Directions insufficient; to speak of stillness is to find even a single room more than enough."*

**Scroll Eight** records: Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Pingyang in Wei Commandery. During the Ming Emperor’s reign, he retired to Mount Zhong, where he built a hermitage and concealed himself in deep seclusion.

**Scroll Thirteen** records: Yu Chengxian, styled Chongguang, was a native of Yingchuan. Twice summoned to serve as Registrar of his home province, he refused. When envoys were sent to formally appoint him, he shut his door and withdrew into seclusion, preventing them from advancing.

**Summoning Daoist Adepts**
From *Biographies of Daoist Scholars, Scroll Seven*:
Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Dongqian in Wu Commandery. He secluded himself on Mount Lu’s Waterfall Mountain to cultivate the Dao. Emperor Ming of the Liu-Song, desiring to propagate Daoist teachings, widely sought those of eminent virtue. Admiring the master’s character, he dispatched envoys to summon him. In the third year of the Taishi era (467 CE), the emperor issued an edict to Wang Jingzong, Governor of Jiangzhou, ordering him to urge the master’s journey to the capital with all due courtesy. The master declined on grounds of illness, yet the edicts came repeatedly. Though the emperor could not secure his presence, his admiration only deepened. Imperial messengers followed one another in an unbroken stream, for his arrival was deemed inevitable.

The Master then declared: "His Majesty is wise and far-seeing, yet deigns to regard one as unworthy as I with favor. Gazing upward, I feel the vastness of spring’s generosity; looking downward, I am deeply ashamed and fearful. Even Laozi relinquished his post as royal archivist to aid the Zhou court, and the Perfected Immortal [Zhang Daoling] set aside his golden seal and bamboo tablet to assist the Wu dynasty. Those who have attained the Dao and become lofty perfected ones still humble themselves—what am I, that I alone should preserve my own integrity?" Thereupon, he commanded his disciple Chen Piaozhi to journey to the capital.

Upon first arriving in Jiujiang, the Prince of Jiujiang inquired of him regarding the similarities and differences between Buddhism and Daoism. The Master replied: "In Buddhism, it is the *Liushen* [‘Retained in Qin’]; in Daoism, it is the Jade Emperor—these are but different paths leading to the same end." The prince and his ministers praised his words.

Upon reaching the capital, the emperor ordered the Director of the Imperial Secretariat, Ji Lin Zixuan, to convey his decree, bidding the Master reside in the Rear Hall. The Master found no joy in this and temporarily stayed at the *Biaoqi Hanghu Kezi* Abode. Imperial messengers bearing inquiries came in an unbroken stream, and both court and common folk rejoiced in anticipation.

Thereafter, the emperor commanded the Minister over the Masses, the Prince of Jian’an, and the President of the Imperial Secretariat, Yuan Can, to prepare a grand banquet of wide embrace, setting forth a seat to welcome worthies. Eminent scholars of the age were broadly assembled, and the finest minds of the time gathered at the solemn Buddhist monastery. At that time, masters of profound discourse let their eloquence flow like rivers, and learned śramaṇas advanced their arguments with sharp brilliance. Daoists and Buddhists vied in debate, each posing challenges to the other. The Master, however, set forth principles with concise words, resolving entanglements and blunting sharpness. The prince and his ministers sighed in admiration, and all present, near and far, were pleased and convinced.

When the gathering concluded, a memorial was presented to the emperor. Within ten days, another assembly was convened at the *Hualin Yanxian* Pavilion. The emperor personally attended, and all the princes and ministers gathered. The Master, wearing a deer-hide cap, paid his respects to the emperor and ascended. The Son of Heaven grew even more reverent, personally inquiring of the Dao and seeking the ultimate principle. The Master expounded upon the mysteries of the Daoist gate, elucidating its traditions and lineages, all of which reached the subtlest and most profound, none failing to embody wondrous standards. The emperor’s heart was delighted.

The prince and his ministers then asked: "We have never heard Daoists speak of the two ages [past and future]." The Master replied: "The scriptures say, ‘I know not whose child it is, but it resembles the ancestor of the Emperor.’ Since there is an ancestor, there is clearly a descendant. Since there is an ancestor and a descendant, there is clearly a middle. Zhuangzi said, ‘As it is born, so it dies’—this also clarifies the three ages. Yet the words are few and the principle profound; the world has not yet awakened to it."

The court sought to entice him with honors, but the Master remained distant and unmoved.

The Song emperor then built the Hall of Lofty Emptiness north of the capital to honor him, constructing grand edifices and widely inviting eminent companions. There, the Master broadly opened the gates of the Dao, deeply expounding its arcane classics. Court and commoner alike turned their attention to him, and both Daoists and layfolk gave him their hearts. The flourishing of Daoist teachings reached its zenith in this era.

Volume Eight states: Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Pingyang in Wei Commandery. Devoted to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he thoroughly studied the methods of the Dao and styled himself the Recluse of Huayang. Initially, he rested at Mount Gouqu in Jurong County, ascending its cliffs to seek stillness. When Emperor Ming of Qi ascended the throne, fearing discord with the hidden spirits, he urgently requested the Recluse to visit the renowned sacred peaks, offering prayers and paying respects. Thus, Tao traveled through five commanderies over three years. Upon completing his tasks, he was welcomed back and allowed to rest at Mount Zhongling. Messengers came and went several times a month, bearing lavish gifts and provisions, fulfilling every request. The court and common folk alike inundated him with letters, their frequency becoming burdensome.

Volume Nine states: In the second year of Jianwu under the Qi, Tao received an imperial edict to pray at the eastern sacred mountains and exhaustively seek the scriptures. It also states: Jiang Fuchu, a native of Yixing, came and went from Mount Mao, aspiring to dwell there. Emperor Gao of Qi built an abbey on the mountain, and in the second year of Jianyuan, he issued an edict inviting Jiang to perform Daoist rites at Chongyang Abbey.

Volume Twelve states: Meng Zhizhou, a man of Emperor Wu of Liang’s time, was broadly learned. Prince Jinghui of Liang governed Shenji and invited Zhizhou to lecture at Guangzhai Temple. When the monk Fayun arrived, he initiated the discourse. Fayun’s profound understanding was unmatched, and he treated Zhizhou with disdain. Yet as they exchanged words, Zhizhou’s expositions shone brilliantly, and the assembly of monks marveled and submitted to him.

Volume Fourteen states: Sun Youyue, styled Xuanda, was a native of Yongkang in Dongyang. He abstained from grains, consuming hemp fibers, pine, and wood. In the third year of Yongming under the Qi, he was summoned by edict to serve as abbot of Xingshi Abbey.

Volume Sixteen states: Kong Lingchan, a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji, deeply studied the essentials of the Dao and perused the entire corpus of immortals’ texts. Emperor Ming of Song established Huaixian Abbey beside the Yu Cavern and decreed that Kong reside there. He was later promoted to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, granted the title Gentleman of the Palace, and bestowed with a deer-fur cap, a coarse fur robe, and bamboo and silk vessels. The emperor’s handwritten edict read: “You possess the bearing of the ancients. I grant you the attire of a recluse. On the day of your ascent, you may come to visit me.”

Volume Nineteen states: Xu Shizi, styled Dewei, was a native of Donghai. When Emperor Wu of Chen established Zongxu Abbey, he appointed Shizi as its abbot. Six or seven years later, Shizi passed away at the abbey. Emperor Wen issued an edict reproaching the lack of funerary provisions, and thereafter, all matters concerning his burial were supplied by the imperial court.

**Ritual of Presenting Tablets to Mountains and Waters**
*The Fourteenth Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* states: Those who study long life and preserve the luminous spirits must rely on the benevolence of mountains and the wisdom of waters, for these are the foundations of movement and stillness. To rely on benevolence is to be still and long-lived; to rely on wisdom is to be active and joyful. Joy is near water, longevity like mountains. Dwelling in mountains and delighting in waters is the method of long life. One should present tablets bearing one’s name and pay homage to the spirits of mountains and waters. The numinous sovereigns of the emperors protect the virtuous, enabling them to cultivate benevolence and wisdom and attain long life as divine immortals.

On the eight seasonal nodes at the hours of *yin* and *wu*, write in cinnabar on a white hibiscus tablet: “Your humble descendant, [name], of [state, commandery, county, village, and rank], seeks long life, transfers his register to the Great Clarity, alters the record of death, and inscribes the talisman of life.” When the tablet is filled, face the mountain’s king, burn incense, open the censer, bow twice, read the tablet, bow twice again, and kneel. Wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, bow twice more, and place it upon a rock. Let no one witness this. Close the censer and depart without looking back.

For waters, board a boat and drift to the center of the current. Bow twice, then face the water’s king, open the censer, bow from the heart, read the tablet, bow again, wrap and bind it as before, and tie it to a clean stone to sink it. Beginning at the start of spring, perform this twenty-four times over three years, and you will surely summon the perfected. If, due to public or private matters, you miss a single node, begin anew. If the count is complete but no response comes, your merit is slight and your conduct coarse—redouble your efforts and cultivate with precision. Over time, spirits will descend, and you will know good and ill fortune, understanding both the hidden and manifest. Cease only when the Dao is achieved.

*The Upper Jade Instructions of the Red Writ* states: The Primordial Numinous Treasure addressed the Water Sovereign, cutting away the tablet of sins. The superior method is as follows: “The Yellow Emperor of the Numinous Treasure, [your name], aged [years], born on [month, day], yearns for divine transcendence and long life without death, with the Three Origins preserved together. O Nine Prefectures’ Water Sovereign, Twelve River Sources, and the great spirits of the Jiang, Hai, Huai, and Ji rivers and the vast seas, I beseech you to erase my sinful name, report it to the Nine Heavens, and present it to the Water Palace. By golden dragon courier, [your name] submits this announcement to the local earth god of [state] on the first day of [month, year].”

Write this in cinnabar on a silverwood tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, and have a golden dragon bear the tablet into the depths of the Three Rivers. Initially, attach nine golden clasps to the tablet before sinking it; thereafter, this is unnecessary. After three presentations, cease. Cast the tablet into a clear, cold abyss, face north, click your teeth three times, and upon finishing the reading, pray: “Supreme and exalted Five Elder Lords of the Primordial Beginning, perfected beings of the ten directions, divine immortals of Mount Taihua, the Red Writ’s proclamation opens all that is hidden. Ascending to the Nine Heavens, I request the descent of the Jade Writ, the sun, moon, and five planets, the Northern Dipper’s seven origins. In the center, I announce this to the Five Peaks and the sacred mountains of the four directions; below, to the rivers and seas, the Twelve Water Sources, the Nine Prefectures’ Water Sovereign, and the great spirits of the vast seas. Today, I make this supreme announcement, unfolding ten thousand wishes. I present the jade tablet, beseeching the erasure of my sins, those of my thousand ancestors and ten thousand forebears, the nine clans and all kin, and the sins that have stained me. May all be universally erased, their roots severed, their names recorded in the Water Palace and proclaimed before the Emperor. May my seven generations of ancestors depart from the Eight Difficulties and ascend to the Nine Heavens, clothed and fed by nature. May my sins be released and dispersed, known to all spirits. I entreat the golden dragon to bind the Water Officials in covenant. As I have stated, let the golden dragon courier transmit this.”

It is further stated: The Primordial Numinous Treasure announces to the Five Marchmounts and the sacred mountains, seeking the erasure of sins and the attainment of transcendence.

The supreme method declares: The Numinous Treasure Yellow Emperor Master, so-and-so, born in such-and-such a year, month, and day, of such-and-such age, whose fate is bound to the Yellow Emperor and whose name is registered at Mount Tai, yearns for divine transcendence and immortality, to ascend through the world and soar into the Upper Clarity.

O Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts, most divine and numinous, I beseech you to erase my name from the ledgers of sin and inscribe it in the Nine Heavens. I present this petition at the sacred mountain, to be transmitted by the golden dragon courier.

On the first day of such-and-such a month and year, I, the disciple, submit this announcement at such-and-such a state and such-and-such a marchmount.

Inscribe this in vermilion on a silver-wood tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, affix nine golden clasps, and bury it with a golden dragon at the marchmount of one’s fate, all in accordance with the above method.

At the marchmount of one’s fate, face east, knock the teeth nine times, and upon finishing the reading of the tablet, recite the prayer:

Mysterious Elder, Radiant and Clear,
Primordial One who oversees the Perfected.
Five Elders of the Emperor,
Vermilion Script and Cinnabar Texts.
Heaven and Earth in their origin,
Governing the Three Primes.
Drawing in qi and summoning assembly,
Hastening the ascent of transcendents.
Supreme talismanic mandate,
A single Dao spanning the Ten Heavens.
Sun, moon, and stellar lodges,
Five Marchmounts and sacred mountains.
Above the heavens, below the earth,
Vast spirits of the deep,
Overseeing life and recording destiny,
At the Southern Three Gates.
Binding the jade tablet,
Inscribing names in the celestial register.
Erasing the books of sin,
Promoting to the ranks of imperial ministers.
A thousand ancestors and ten thousand forebears,
Nine clans and all kin,
All delivered from the Five Paths and Eight Difficulties,
Departing the Three Evils,
Their souls ascending to the Nine Heavens.
Liberated in life and death,
Preserved for ten thousand kalpas.
Today I make this supreme announcement,
Heard by all spirits.
I entreat the golden clasps
To bind the Perfected Officials in covenant.
As I have stated,
Let the golden dragon courier transmit this.

It is further stated: The Primordial Numinous Treasure announces to the Nine Earthly Soil Sovereigns, beseeching the obliteration of sins, the proclamation of names, and the attainment of transcendence.

The supreme method declares: The Numinous Treasure Yellow Emperor Master, so-and-so, born in such-and-such a year, month, and day, of such-and-such age, whose fate is bound to the Nine Heavens and whose register is held by the Central Dipper, yearns for divine transcendence and immortality, to ascend through the world and soar into the Upper Clarity.

O Central August One of the Nine Earths,
Yellow Spirits of Wu and Ji,
Five Emperors of the Soil Palace,
I beseech you to erase my record of sins
And inscribe it in the Great Mystery.
I present this petition at the Central Palace,
Submitting the tablet to record my name.
Today I pledge my sincerity,
To be transmitted by the golden dragon courier.

On the first day of such-and-such a month and year, I, the disciple, submit this announcement at the central precinct of such-and-such a commandery, state, village, and hamlet.

Inscribe this in vermilion on a silver-wood tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, affix nine golden clasps and one golden dragon, and bury it at the central palace of one’s dwelling, all in accordance with the above method.

In the central courtyard, face the sovereign, knock the teeth twelve times, and upon finishing the reading of the tablet, recite the prayer:

Heaven unfolds, Earth extends,
Nine qi divide the numinous.
Three luminaries share the same talisman,
Ten directions shine in clarity.
Five Elder Emperors,
Opening the Perfected and governing life.
Cinnabar Script and Jade Texts,
Yao’s primordial essence ascends.
Universally announced to the world,
Nine Soil Sovereigns and numinous spirits.
Today I make this supreme announcement,
All transcendents confirm my birth.
I yearn for my divine transcendence,
I present my jade name.
Great August One of the Soil Palace,
Erase my sins and punishments.
Submit the tablet to the Upper Palace,
Inscribe it in the registers of Splendor and Azure.
Ascend and soar,
Heaven and Earth share the numinous.
Nine clans and all kin,
Their decayed bones renewed in glory.
Their souls ascend to the Southern Palace,
Transformed in the transcendent courts.
On this auspicious day, I proclaim my mandate,
Heard by all spirits.
I entreat the golden clasps
To manifest the covenant of utmost sincerity.
As I have stated,
Let the golden dragon courier transmit this.

The Dao declares: To deliver the people of all heavens, liberating them from the Five Paths and Eight Difficulties, enabling them to pass beyond the Three Evils, and ensuring they encounter the Dao in every lifetime, one must present the Three Prime Jade Tablets on the days of the Eight Nodal Points and the jiazi cycle, erasing the ledgers of past sins and proclaiming names to Heaven. Each matter is to be presented three times before all heavens, the Three Officials, and the Nine Palaces, with successive transmissions and separate submissions to Heaven. All spirits will revere and protect, the Five Emperors will attend, the Three Realms will receive and welcome, gates and thresholds will be ordered, the earthly spirits of the world and the deities of sun and moon will come to pay homage. A thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not rashly interfere. With resolve firm and pure, all aspirations will be fulfilled. Seven generations of ancestors will be delivered from the Three Wretched Paths and the Five Sufferings, ascending to the Heavenly Halls. The blessings of life and death will reciprocate like echoes. The Three Officials and Nine Palaces record the merits and transgressions of people—this principle is most clear.

The second scroll of *The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* concludes.
The third scroll of *The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* begins.

Master Wang Xuanhe of the Vast Ocean of Lu, Feathered Guest of the Great Tang, on the Methods of Ingesting and Consuming:

*The Biographies of the Immortals, Lower Scroll* states: "Cease eating and rest the roots to expel grain-qi. Through breathwork and guiding the qi, exhale the old and inhale the new."

*The Upper Scroll of Jade Characters of Inner Sounds* states: "If you wish to become an immortal and not die, you must expel the Three Worms and the corpse-worm lurking beneath the heart. Regularly at midnight and cock’s crow, recite this invocation:

*To the Azure Fang of the East, consume the Azure Fang, drink the morning blossom—three swallows, then stop.
To the Vermilion Cinnabar of the South, consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool—three swallows, then stop.
To the Central Wilds, where Wu and Ji rise high, consume the essence-qi, drink from the Sweet Spring—three swallows, then stop.
To the Luminous Stone of the West, consume the Luminous Stone, drink the numinous liquid—three swallows, then stop.
To the Mystic Nourishment of the North, consume the Mystic Nourishment, drink the Jade Syrup—three swallows, then stop.*

After thirty days of this, the Three Worms will all die, and the corpse-worm will flee. The true spirit and true qi will naturally settle; the corpse-worm will no longer return to the heart, and you shall become an immortal. This is the method of the Five Directions and Five Fangs—it is also the Five Kitchens. Thus, the *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* by Laozi states: 'Cultivate and uphold the Great Harmony, neither deficient nor excessive. Taste it and find no flavor; smell it and find no fragrance. If you come to know this, your destiny aligns with the true stars. Once received, it is never lost, and eternal joy arises naturally.' The *Forty-Four Methods Scripture of the Yellow Plain* also contains this text on ingesting and invoking."

*The Upper Scripture of Astronomy* states: "The reason the people of remote antiquity lived long was that they did not consume grains even in haste."

*The Scripture of Great Possession* says: "The Five Grains are the chisels that hollow out life, rotting the five viscera and shortening the lifespan. Once these roots enter the mouth, do not hope for longevity. If you desire not to die, keep your intestines free of filth."

*The Seventh Scroll of the Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: "Lu Xiujing, styled Yuande, was a native of Dongqian in Wuxing. Though outwardly he mingled with worldly affairs, inwardly he preserved purity and simplicity. From youth, he practiced grain avoidance and slept alone."

The sixteenth scroll states: "Tao Yan, styled Aijing, was a native of Xunyang in Lujiang. At fifteen or sixteen, he consumed and ceased grains, initially still eating wheat flour, later only jujubes."

*The Lower Scroll of the Essential Rites of the Numinous Treasure Fast* states: "If Daoists eat the Five Grains but take no other sustenance, they will hunger. If consuming medicinal substances, take them precisely at noon; after noon, drink only clear water and cease eating. At dawn, drink congee; at midday, eat vegetables."

*The Lower Scroll of the Great Perfection Regulations* states: "Those who study the records of external and internal cultivation to learn immortality should all consume and swallow qi to repel evil and cure illness. For those who cannot yet cease grains, meals should be regular: congee at dawn, vegetable stew and rice at midday, with dried vegetables and fermented beans—enough only to stave off hunger, not to indulge in rich flavors or fine tastes. Take care never to kill living beings or waste fat and fresh foods. As for sauces and vinegar, these too must not be overused, for excess harms one’s nature. Moreover, do not overeat; it is best to stop one or two mouthfuls short. After eating, walk leisurely to aid digestion. Before and after meals, meditate on the boundless grace of the ancient sages, whose beneficence endures without end. Universally wish that all beings attain fullness and satisfaction, that they may receive the sweet dew and mushroom nectar, never hunger again, and no longer crave the dusty flavors of the world. If accepting food from others, feel humility and gratitude toward the host. With heart and mouth, wish the donor wealth, joy, fullness, and long life, that they too may partake of the flavor of the Dao, forever free from calamity and decline, without hunger or thirst. Always have Dharma-food and worldly food to offer all beings without end, aiding and liberating them with generosity, free from regret or stinginess, never harboring resentment, forever sharing joy. After the first meal, scatter rice in the mountains and waters, beneath cliffs and forests, or beside fences and walls—never toss it onto rooftops, lest insects and birds peck through and cause leaks and decay."

*The Scripture of the Forty-Four Methods of the Yellow Plain* states: "Whenever Daoists are about to eat, they should hold their chopsticks in the left hand, tap the plate three times, and softly invoke: *'The Two Mysteries ascend the Dao, the Four Poles are clear and cool. The Supreme One, the Lord Emperor, and the hundred spirits are at peace. Receive the roots of the Three Palaces, irrigate and nourish the numinous spleen. Partake of the Great Harmony, feast on the five fragrances. The life of the soul-embryo, the seven fluids flow and settle; the hundred passages harmonize, the five viscera bloom with radiance. The Twin Sovereigns merge with the light, soaring to ascend the Upper Clarity.'* After eating, tap the plate three more times—this is called the Way of the Soul-Embryo receiving fragrance and the hundred spirits feasting on the roots. Practicing this regularly makes one’s spirit bright and qi harmonious, the hun and po at peace, repelling evil and dispelling trials, forever preserving good fortune and purity."

*The Ninth Scroll of the Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: "Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a native of Kuaiji. Entering the mountains, he encountered an immortal woman who resembled an image. He kowtowed and begged for longevity. The woman said: *'Your qi from blood and food is not yet exhausted. Cease grains for three years, then return—I will await you here.'* Xiang returned home, ceased grains for three years, and went back. The woman was still in the same place and gave him a scroll of the *Scripture of the Returning Elixir*, saying: *'Attain this, and you shall become an immortal. Do nothing else.'*"

*The Scripture of the Nine Radiances* states: "Jujubes are the fruit of the rosy clouds; rosy clouds are the essence of the sun. Consuming them, the body generates jadelike radiance—this is the method of reflecting the Upper Clarity."

*The Rituals of the Three Sovereigns’ Fasts* states: "Those who cultivate the Dao eat once at midday and once at the hour of living qi at midnight. These two meals, day and night, are taken at the hour of living qi to avoid the hour of dead qi. At other times, not even the slightest morsel may be tasted, for it would violate the dead qi. If ill or gathering herbs, or consuming medicines to cease grains, follow what is appropriate without rigid constraints. Food is for nourishing the body; when the body is at ease, the spirit is joyful. Those who are not hungry find cultivation easy to accomplish; those weakened by hunger and emaciation will not achieve their work."

It further states: "At the hour of the single meal in Daoist practice, one must burn incense in contemplation, making offerings to the former sages. With eyes closed, one visualizes the descent of the prior spirits, who partake of the offering for a long while. One’s wishes and thoughts extend to all beings, that all may be equally sated and fulfilled."

*The Scripture of the Five Wondrous Talismans of the Cavernous Mystery* states: "Consuming the essence of the moon grants longevity; consuming the essence of the stars ascends one to the Grand Clarity."

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection, Second Scroll* states: "Ingesting *yunya* allows one to cease grains and expel the corpse-worms."

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection, Fourth Scroll* states: "Ingesting *yunya* enables the cultivation of the Dao of True Unity, the preservation of primordial qi, and the swallowing of saliva. If hunger arises, one should consume wheat-based foods, gradually reducing grain intake until grains are abandoned entirely. One must not abandon them all at once—this is what is meant by 'diminishing and diminishing again, until reaching non-action.'"

*The Scripture of the Golden Tablet and Jade Characters* states: "Those who consume medicinal substances to cease grains must abstain from wine, meat, and the five pungent vegetables. They should bathe, wear clean clothes, and burn incense." This is also seen in *The Scripture of Great Possession and Wondrous Mystery*.

*The Cavernous Mystery Scripture of the Supreme Unity* states: "If you cannot consume medicinal substances to cease grains and purify the intestines to refine the true, you should at least moderate all foul and bloody meats, as well as mixed foods of pungent and rank vegetables, strictly prohibiting them. This can extend the span of life."

It further states: The Perfected Consort Wang of the Purple Tenuity, a true immortal, advocated the consumption of *muxu*: "For the true person nurturing life, the Most High treasures it. The Seven Classics and Five Effulgences, the Two Pure Internal Dao—all emerge from it. Consuming and employing various medicines, gathering and refining the hundred herbs, warding off pestilence and securing life, *mu* is the finest. It flushes away the hundred evils, dispels illness, and resists aging. The body generates radiant luster, filling the flesh and replenishing the brain. Without diligent devotion, one cannot obtain it—without natural endowment, without methods and recipes, one will surely wither."

It further states: "Nurturing nature and halting aging, preserving the blackness of hair—this is what the *mu* family governs." It also states: "Now, *mu* blocks the paths of evil and obstructs the roads of ghosts. Consuming its nine preparations refines the spirit and quickens the four limbs, making the constructive and defensive qi light and agile. Ingesting its decoctions and powders dispels the hundred illnesses—this enables longevity and enduring vision." The methods for compounding *mu* are numerous, so they are not transcribed here.

It further states: "Rub the face and eyes with both hands until slightly warm, making this a regular practice, to be done frequently. When a person ages, wrinkles first appear below the eyes. When a person’s qi and power wane, it first begins between the nostrils. These two places are the gates of wrinkles and decline, the passes of the body’s qi and strength. Thus, in daily life, one should regularly practice this method to ward off wrinkles and decline, preserving qi and strength in constant harmony."

*The Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll One Hundred Fourteen* states: The Azure Lad gathers *feigen*, swallows solar effulgences, ingests the Luminous Spirit Talisman, the Lunar Splendor Talisman, and the Talisman for Expelling the Two [Demons]. He binds the three *hun*, restrains the seven *po*, wears the Star and Constellation Talisman, consumes *huadan*, drinks Yellow Water and Returning Water, eats *huangang*, consumes phoenix brain, eats pine pears and plum jujubes, ingests silver, purple gold, and cloud fat, eats bamboo shoots, wears the Five Spirit Talismans—with these, his transformations are endless. He transcends beyond the Three Realms, roaming within the Six Directions."

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection, Seventh Scroll* states: "Those who consume the Five Minerals can eat nine times a day, with the hundred passages flowing purely. They can also go a full year without hunger, reverting from old age to infancy. When food is encountered, they eat; when not, they remain at ease. This is the wondrous method of the highest immortals, the marvelous efficacy of ceasing grains." Tao Hongjing’s commentary states: "Though they eat nine times a day, they absorb and exhale without sound, their flow and transformation unchanging, producing no saliva. Though they go a year without eating, their complexion becomes fresher."

The Azure Lad says: "Dry mineral [powder] with rice, mixed with eastern green and vermilion essence—one dose immediately extends a person’s lifespan by a thousand years, with each day’s consumption further prolonging it."

The Perfected of Pure Numinosity also says: On Mount Huo, there were Daoist practitioners Deng Boyuan and Wang Xuanfu, who received the method of consuming *qingjing* [azure essence] rice and swallowing solar effulgences. They practiced this from the time of the Celestial Master Fang until thirty-four years had passed, whereupon they could internally perceive the five viscera and write in darkness at midnight.

It further states: "Thrice-steamed azure rice is not an ordinary food." It also states: "Eating wheat-based foods makes reducing grains easier, or supplementing and filling the body is simple. The intestines and stomach become full, no longer empty and weak. Consuming [azure] rice, the hundred harms cannot injure you, illnesses cannot afflict you. It dispels all distracting thoughts, severs the Three Corpses, sharpens hearing and vision, and lightens the steps."

The commentary states: "Cinnabar and azure harmonize the spirit and nurture qi, enabling one to resist and repel disasters and pestilence. Thus, harms and illnesses no longer assail you. With the essence and *hun* in joyful harmony, there are no worries or sorrowful thoughts. Once grains are abandoned, the corpse-worms naturally dissolve. The liver and kidneys become clear and moist, the ears and eyes bright and penetrating, the sinews strong and bones firm—movement is like flying."

It further states: "In famine years without grain, or when impoverished and unable to obtain it, one may consume *nanzhu* alone, or mix it with *fuling*, or blend *nanzhu* with honey, or combine it with pine and cypress leaves."

It further states: "Ceasing grains does not necessarily grant longevity. The necessity of ceasing grains lies in following the cultivation of numinous wonders, freeing oneself from the burdens of cooked foods and rooted grains, and consuming medicinal minerals to seek swift efficacy."

It further states: "Through grains, one ceases grains, transforming the six bowels gradually." It also states: "For ease of absorption and attraction, nothing surpasses the Seven Luminaries. For swift success in cultivation, nothing exceeds the Nine Ways. For steadfast preservation, nothing surpasses *zhensheng*. For urgent defense and protection, nothing surpasses *hunshen*. For rapid efficacy of medicinal minerals, nothing excels *qingjing*. For utmost responsiveness in prayer and worship, nothing is superior to morning and evening offerings."

Those who consume the Five Minerals stabilize the five viscera. If they briefly die, their white bones become like jade. The seven *po* attend them, the two *hun* guard their dwelling, the Three Primes rejoice in rest, the great spirits close within, and externally, they infuse the skin and flesh. Though the body may decay, if the viscera and bowels remain unharmed, their appearance and form remain as in life. The bone marrow does not wither, the sinews and brain interflow, the *hun* and *po* stand guard, the Three Palaces are tranquil and still. Since the great spirits no longer roam the Nine Transformations but remain closed within the Cavern Chamber, they will only resume their circulation on the destined day of rebirth.

Should one emerge after forty years, twenty years, ten years, or three years—each according to their will—at the moment of rebirth, blood is gathered anew, flesh nurtured, fluids generated, and essence reconstituted into form, surpassing even their appearance before death. This is what is meant by "the Perfected refining the body in the Great Yin, transforming countenance in the Three Bureaus."

The Heavenly Thearch Lord states: "Refining the body in the Great Yin excels all; consuming the Nine-Turned Elixir, one’s form becomes upright and solemn, the complexion like numinous clouds. Ascending the Terrace of the Great Ultimate, one’s name is inscribed among the Perfected."

It further cites the Nine Radiance Serene Consort: "Worries and burdens do not disturb the Mystic Abode; sorrowful thoughts do not agitate the Crimson Ford. In tranquil detachment and distant contemplation, one delights in the shared reflection of light. Observing the four seasons in their revolutions, daily attaining perfection, one gazes into the farthest reaches, all having merged with the divine."

On the seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month, one visualizes the Mystic Elixir.
On the first, eleventh, sixteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-sixth days of the month, one visualizes the Precious Mirror—envisioning one’s two eyes transformed into two luminous mirrors, illuminating the entire body.

On *dingmao* days, one pays audience to the Azure Lad.

At the *chen* and *chou* hours, one visualizes the Double Radiance—all these are methods for cultivating the Dao.

It further states: "Ascending the Mystic, pacing the flying steps, and returning in gratitude; restraining the *hun* and controlling the *po*—these too are its methods."

The *Upper Clarity Scripture on Dispelling Demons* says: "Jade teeth and dense blossoms, the Seven Yangs’ Infant, the fluid of the Nine Jades, the essence of the Eight Precious Stones, the purple nectar of the Four Pistils, the Five Pearls descending to give birth to the Three Florets flying as steel, the twin pearls of lunar brightness, orchid liquid and golden stalks, sweet dew in jade vases, divine lotus elixir and cinnabar powder, cloud branches linked in camps, jade groves forming at dawn, the Western Thearch’s plain abundance—rinsing and transforming these, one enters the Purple Court."

It further says: "The waters of the Eastern Culmen’s Weaving Maiden, the westernmost reaches of Long Geng and Yu Yuan, the southern extremity of the Yang Light’s root, the northern depths of the Great Yin’s Liquid Citadel."

It further says: "From the north, gather the black crabapple of the Mystic Expanse; gazing upward, rinse the vermilion honey of cloud mountains. From the east, pluck the cinnabar mulberries of Fusang; bending down, probe the patterned algae of the Long Abyss. Above, harmonize the flying jade of the Nine Turns; below, swallow the rosy treasures of the Azure Mystery. The Great Void forms its rings; the Plain Infant cradles them. The Purple Dragon Lad, the Nine-Enveloped Phoenix Brain, the Hidden Mushroom of the Great Ultimate, the Crimson Tree of the Solar Path, the Rainbow Plum of the Supreme, the Great Grass of the Celestial Han, the Giant Pearl of the Southern Palace, the Aged Supporter of the Western Ministers, the Three-Beamed Dragon Flower—these are what the Numinous Consort seeks. Those who obtain and consume them divide their spirit into myriad paths."

It further says: "The secluded mushrooms of the Upper Clarity, the Great Harmony; the speckled dragon’s black embryo, the striped tiger’s white foam—these emerge from the Western Mound. The Seven Mysteries’ flying nodes, the Nine Apertures’ jade pearls, cloud nectar and numinous fluid, the jade richness of the Mystic Orchard, the white glue of Bell Mountain, gold born of blue unfolding, the stone brain of Langfeng, the black river’s coral, the white discharge of Meng Mountain, the jade lungs of the Numinous Mound, the azure simurgh’s golden essence, the Eastern Flower’s vermilion melon, the nine-jointed interlacing, the purple hemp of the Supreme Subtlety. Jade blossoms and jade fruits, the whale waves of Flowing Abyss, the red river’s crimson jade. From the north, draw from the well of the Great Ultimate; in the center, string the vermilion veins of the Patterned Cinnabar. The divine peach of the Cloud Court, the jade fluid of Kun Garden. The night essence and solar grass, the azure ford and blue reeds. Above, summon the divine radiance; below, drink from the dark rapids. Gaze upward to grasp the jade essence of the Mystic Orchard; bend down to pluck the purple crabapple of the Garden Mound. The divine clam of White Water, the red leeks of the Eight Heavens—once in ten thousand generations, their radiance flows through the nine descendants. Those who obtain and consume them are treasured by the Supreme."

It further says: "Refining the nine stones into smoke, the cinnabar fluid and jade sap, the flowing pearls of Xunshou, the essence of speckled blossoms, the golden fluid of the cinnabar furnace, the purple blossoms and rainbow petals, the Nine Turns of the Great Clarity, the nectar of the Five Clouds, the dark frost and crimson snow, leaping through the Three Yellows, the white fragrance of the Eastern Sea, the azure coins of Canglang, the surplus grain of the high mounds, the flying fields of piled stones, the returning elixir of the Great Void, the dark firmness of the Great Simplicity, the flowing grass of eternal light, the flying thousand of the cloud lads—these too enable one to ascend and soar lightly."

It further says: "The thirty-six mushrooms, the flying furnace refining smoke, the solar waters and lunar blossoms, the richness of the Five Lords—these stabilize the five viscera and refine the countenance, transforming the body. Even the cloud-scattered marvelous blossoms, the golden powder and jade softness, can extend one’s years to ten thousand."

It further says: "The dark water and cloud blossom nectar, the five yellows within the dense numen, the essence-dried stone □ meal, the many greens and vermilion flowers, the fruits of the white chariot’s flying nodes, the purple wood’s yellow of the flowing crow—consuming these at once grants one a lifespan of a thousand epochs."

It further says: "The fat of pine and cypress in the shade, mountain ginger that subdues essence, calamus, ophiopogon, sesame, polygonatum, chrysanthemum, lycium, cliff honey, poria, peach bark, alisma, Solomon’s seal, coptis, cimicifuga, rehmannia, gastrodia, vermilion blossoms, and the numinous flying ice cassia—consuming these brings minor benefit, yet grants no hope of ascending to the azure heavens."

The *Supreme Unity Cavern-True Mystery Canon* states: "The Supreme Unity draws in the purple mist." The Supreme Unity is the spirit within the human body.

The *Eight Simplicities Canon* states: "The blossom of the moon is the qi of the solar radiance, reflected in the Eastern Well."

The *Twenty-Four Images of Life* states: "At dawn, array the essence of the Five Stars; at midday, gather the essence of the sun’s nectar; at dusk, consume the yellow blossom of the moon."

The *Eight Yang Songs of the Nine Chapters* states: "Looking up, one inhales the pearl-like blossoms; looking down, one awakens to clarity."

The *Seventh Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: "As the years and months grow distant, let diligence never wane. Strengthen the body and refine the qi; cultivate the elixir with propriety. Then the five richnesses transform the countenance—this is the liquid of the dark water. The seven yangs alter the substance—this is the essence of the crooked. The crane refines the void—this is the nine-times-cycled cinnabar. The dragon soars with the sun—this is the blossom of langgan jade. The tin scroll ascends the jade steps—this is the journey to the Supreme Subtlety. Receiving the affair in the jasper chamber—this is the journey to the Jade Dawn. My Dao is complete."

The text further states: "Inhale the blossoms of flying langgan jade, rinse the dragon embryo, drink the essence of jade, ingest the golden elixir, draw from the nine transformations, consume the numinous treasure, practice the Nine Perfected, refine the frost of white lang, and the ten-times-cycled purple blossom. Conceal and shift the white haze, disperse the spirit and stone essence, form the golden radiance numinous pellet—these are the dregs of the *Golden Sword Scripture’s* Crooked Dawn Elixir, the Nine Palaces Right Perfected Lord Guo’s Lesser Golden Licorice Pellet Formula, Master Chang Sang’s Wood-Inhaling Method, Bian Que’s Death-Reversing Formula, the Sesame Powder, the Poria Pill, the Nine Jade Nectars, the Eight Jade Flying Essences, the Supreme Lord’s Refined Immortal Pellet—these are the Eight Jade Elixirs.

The Grand Ultimate Perfected’s Azure [Grain] Meal, the Upper Immortal’s Numinous Formula, the Grand Ultimate Perfected’s Cloud Bud Jade-Inhaling Method, Master High Mound’s Four-Fan Divine Immortal Powder Formula, the Tortoise Terrace Queen Mother’s Four Youths’ Numinous Formula, the Supreme Lord’s Eight Jade Flying Essence Elixir’s Embryo-Ingesting Method, the Returning Spirit and Guarding the Corporeal Soul’s Yellow-Red Inner Perfected Preserving Numinous Pine-Soot Flowing Azure-Purple Pellet, the Primordial Spirit’s Root-Cutting Worm Pellet, the Cinnabar’s Dark Essence, the Golden Azure Purple Syrup, the Eight Jade Crimson Liquid, the Dragon Embryo and Phoenix Brain, the Cloud Lang Jade Blossom, the Nine Cauldrons’ Cloud Powder, the Rainbow Elixir and Stone Brain, the Nine Blossom Elixir, the Northern Nurtured Fire Elixir, the Flowing Pearl Elixir, the Furnace Fire Elixir, the Min Mountain Elixir, the Rainbow Elixir’s Liquid, the Cloud Blossom Elixir, the Singing Elixir, the Golden Liquid, the Eight Directions’ Dao-Guiding Elixir, the Stone’s Yellow, the Cloud Syrup, the Grand Ultimate Perfected’s Bequeathed White Powder and Azure Essence Stone Meal, the Flowing Brightness Powder, the Refined Immortal Pellet, the Worm-Cutting Pellet, the Alisma and Cypress Fruit Pellet, the Alisma and Wood Powder.

The *Seventh Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: 'The five stone cloud richnesses.' The Azure Youth Lord says: 'The five lords’ richnesses settle and generate the five viscera, refining the countenance and transforming the body.' The following is excerpted from the *Five Stone Cloud Richnesses Formula, Fourth Scroll*, cited and annotated in the *Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection*.

The third scroll contains the Langgan Elixir, the Crooked Dawn Elixir, the Nine-Turn Elixir, the Five Lords’ Stone Richness, the Azure Essence Stone Meal, the Four Guardians Pellet, the Four Youths’ Powder, the Four-Fan Powder, the Licorice Pellet, the Primordial Spirit Pellet, the Poria Pellet, the Sesame Pellet, the Flowing Azure Pellet, the Flowing Refined Richness, and the Wood-Ingesting Method.

It further states: 'Cinnabar-yellow seals the ears to dissolve the corpse—this is the essential Dao of refining the corporeal soul.' The Corporeal Soul-Cutting Method: '[Missing character] extinguishes the Three Worms. Cloud buds sever grain to expel the corpse. The Primordial Spirit Pellet kills grain worms and withers the Three Worms. The Five Phases Purple Text eliminates the Three Worms. Ingesting white awn disperses the Three Worms. Frequent bathing washes and refines the corpse and corporeal soul.'

It further states: 'Ingesting and severing grain, resting from grain in the mountains. Severing grains to purify the intestines, purifying the fast and resting from grain. Ingesting [missing character] meal for five years severs grain. Swallowing cloud buds to sever grain. To sever grain, first ingest the Primordial Spirit Pellet and the Supreme Unity’s Four Guardians Pellet—these also sever grain. If one does not sever grain, the *Great Cavern* cannot yet be attained. Severing grain has its own methods in the world. These nine methods consider severing grain as excellent.'

It further states: 'The Licorice Pellet, ingested in small amounts while desiring food, harmonizes with grain to achieve immortality. Next, ingest [missing character] meal while supplementing grain without neglect, benefiting the body and dispelling illness, filling and fattening the flesh, then ascend mountains to chant cavern scriptures and discourse on subtleties.' These two methods consider not severing grain as excellent. Combined with the seven white numinous vegetables, harmonized with scallions to dissolve [impurities], hence it is called 'combining.' The cloud grass’s dark purity: the black sesame’s richness, the wood’s essence cloud grass—grass moistened like clouds, also likened to clouds containing water, with grass holding its essence. 'Dark' refers to color; 'purity' refers to nourishment. The blossoms of lush herbs’ sweet wine: white honey. The sweet wine is the blossoms of lush herbs, brewed into wine. Honey is the earth’s essence. The five lights and seven scallions’ numinous vegetables: scallion greens. 'Scallion' is pronounced *hu mai* (胡迈反). The 'five' refers to the fifth month, when they are unearthed to avoid the harm of intense fire. The 'seven' is the metal number. White scallions are pungent, the flavor of metal, the essence of scallion metal. 'Numinous vegetables' refers to divine greens. The white plain flying dragon: white quartz. 'White plain' describes its form and color; 'flying dragon' refers to its hidden transformations. The dark water jade liquid: the dark purity’s rich water. 'Jade liquid' is the quartz’s liquid, also called flying dragon cloud richness. 'Flying dragon' is the name of quartz; 'cloud richness' is the name of cloud richness grass. Also called the refined five stones’ blossom ointment. 'Blossom' refers to essence; 'ointment' refers to dark richness. Fanning the southern candle’s eastern glow, summoning the vermilion spirit of the first bud. 'Southern candle' is the essence of yang things; 'eastern glow' is the light of hidden numinosity. 'First bud' is the tender leaf of the thorn tree."

The vermilion spirit is the pure and radiant essence of cinnabar liquid. When the five fluids harmonize and dissipate, the hundred passages become full and flowing, the fluids of the five viscera achieve balance and regulation, and all joints receive their proper overflow—thus, there is no longer the affliction of withering and desiccation.

It is also said: Reinforce this with morning rinses of the Flowering Spring’s five-directional numinous essences, sounding the drum of the Jade Pool, inhaling and exhaling the dark purity, and concurrently employing the method of cloud sprouts—rinsing and washing with clear springs to assist in replenishing their moisture. Then both qi and substance will be sound and flourishing.

The Flowery Richness, when steamed in the □ direction until the stomach is full and settled with malachite, transforms honey to reverse aging and restore youth, making the eyes bright and clear. Malachite stabilizes the generative essence and replenishes fluids, thus filling the intestines with □ radiance.

It is further said: Therefore, with a single initiation of a thousand calculations, longevity follows the flourishing of years. As the years advance with the medicine, one ascends the immortal courts in flying steps. After consuming one dose, life no longer declines. The Five Clouds generate the body, embodying the spirit, qi, and essence. The Azure Lad says: A thousand years of long calculation refers to a single dose. Thus, it is said that a thousand calculations begin with one initiation; consuming ten doses grants ten thousand years of life. When the elders of the five directions descend to bestow the Azure Essence upon a person, and the spirit attaches to the body, that person becomes a perfected one.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One’s Azure Essence Dried Stone □ Meal is a divine recipe of the highest immortals. The commentary states: This herb possesses the spirit of Azure Essence and is also mixed with vermilion and azure to make dried meals, hence it is called Azure Dried Stone □ Meal. □ is pronounced *xùn*. This is a divine recipe of the highest immortal palaces, not a lesser method.

The azure rice of Mount Yu-zhang’s Western Mountain and the Azure Dragon rice of Wu and Yue are examples. Azure rice regulates deficiency and receives the qi of medicines. Pound the Southern Candle herb and tree to extract their juice, then soak the Azure Dragon rice in it to prepare the medicine for consumption. This tree is woody yet resembles a herb, hence it is called the Southern Candle herb-tree. It is also named Monkey Medicine, Male Continuance, Posterior Excellence, Wei-na Wood, and King of Herbs and Trees. It grows on Mount Song’s Shao-shi, Mount Bao-du’s Chicken Head Mountain, and in all famous mountains—not merely in a few places. In the regions of Jiang-zuo and Wu-Yue, it is especially abundant. The locals call it Monkey Uncle or Dye Uncle, resembling gardenia. Its seeds resemble the fruit of the *Zanthoxylum* tree. The *Inner Transmission of Perfected King Jun of Pure Emptiness* elaborates on its methods in full.

The *Upper Prime Treasure Scripture* states: Those who consume the qi of the King of Herbs and Trees commune with the spirit; those who consume the sap of the Azure Candle will never fall. The Southern Candle is Azure Essence, hence it is also called Azure Candle. Consuming it leads to immortality.

It is also said: Regularly rinse with the Flower of the Dark Pool to benefit the six fluids. The commentary states: Diligently cultivate the Way of Cloud Sprouts to replenish the qi of the six palaces. Malachite is empty and luminous, with a youthful countenance—it is a superior immortal-grade mineral medicine as well as an herb or tree.

Regarding the thorn tree, the *Six Jia Yin Talismans* states it is also called Goat Thorn, Hollow Sparse, and Strong Thorn. The *Upper Clarity Six Jia Inner Scripture* contains the *Upper Clarity Jade Palace Five Thearchs’ Inner Contemplation Upper Method*, the *Upper Clarity Numinous Flight Six Jia Inner Contemplation Communion with the Numinous Upper Method*, and the *Pure Emptiness Perfected One’s Offering to the Numinous Flight Upper Method*.

The *Eight Simplicities Scripture* states: The sun’s essence is red with the metal’s essence; the stone’s radiance is the flower of the Water Mother. Refined by the sun’s soul, its eight rays shine. Consuming it, the mysterious gates of essence and spirit generate wondrous light in the body, granting the same lifespan as the sun and moon.

The Yellow Flower of Moonlight: On the twenty-fifth day of the lunar month, when the moon passes above the Eastern Well, bathe in its numinous radiance to adorn and refine the essence’s rays, making the Yellow Flower bright and resplendent. Those who seek immortality should gather the Yellow Flower from the Eastern Well on that day, consume the yang essence from the moon’s soul, allowing it to flow and moisten the nine orifices, and spiritually stabilize the five palaces’ chambers. Cultivating this Way, one ascends to the moon’s court. The moon’s soul resides within the Eastern Well, which is the gateway where the sun and moon’s radiance commune.

The *Three Primes True Unity Scripture* states: Su Lin consumed the Flowing Azure Purple Pellets of Preserving the Numinous Pine Smoke, granting longevity, emerging from yin into yang, and making one’s complexion shine like jade.

It is also said: Perfected One Juan-zi stated: Those who wish to consume medicines must first expel the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses are not expelled, even if one abstains from grains and the five flavors, the worms will not die. The body will grow heavy, dreams will be unreal, and thoughts will be confused and inverted. Evil desires will not be eliminated because the worms reside within, agitating the five spirits.

It is further said: The Restraining Immortal Pellets are the Supreme Eight Proprieties’ Flying Essence Elixir. There are also the Worm-Restraining Divine Pellets. It is also said: Master Qin Gao received the Way of Stabilizing Qi and Benefiting Life, and practiced the method of Replenishing Essence and Returning the Elixir.

The *Upper Scripture of the Sacred Sword* states: The Supreme Ultimate’s Curved Dawn Eight Radiance Flying Essence is named the Supreme Ultimate Hidden Radiance Recorded Form Numinous Pellet. Consuming it enables one to float upon the clouds and soar through the Great Void.

The *Three Primes Jade Tallies* states: The Nine Heavens’ True King rides the nine-colored phoenix.

The *Scripture of the Three Ways’ Sequential Practice* states: The Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen received the essentials of the Highest Sequential Practice of the Three Ways—the Way of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence. Gathering and guiding the numinous radiance, sipping the August Flower, gazing upward to consume the Flying Root, contemplating the Seven Luminaries in the Purple Dawn, the Three Radiance’s reflections hanging down, the Seven Essences flanking the chariot, the Five Numinous intertwining like sashes, the Four Offices composing the chapters, the Western Tortoise determining the records—this is titled the Inscription of the Lofty Dawn.

The *Fourth Hidden Instructions of Ascending Perfection* states: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One consumed the Four Poles’ Cloud Sprouts.

The *Upper Scripture of the Sacred Sword* states: The Barbarian Immortal Mushroom is the flower of flying to heaven. There is also the Fragrance of Reversed Life and the Mountain of Jade Honey.

The *Golden Root Scripture* states: Consume the radiance and swallow the qi, chewing the mysterious root.

The *Upper Scripture of Great Possession* states: The Three Ones of the Mud-Pellet Heavenly Thearch are the numinous ancestors of the single body, the life roots of the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids and humors, and the jade chamber of the soul’s essence. Thus, the Stomach Pool’s body is square to receive things, the Brain Palace is round and empty to accommodate the true. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit smoke, virtue equips one with heaven and earth, and one merges with the Great Mystery—hence it is named the Mud-Pellet.

The Mud-Pellet is the supreme spirit of the bodily form. It is also said: Between the brows, when one retreats inward, on the left resides the Luminous Youthful Perfected Lord, on the right the Luminous Female Perfected Official, and at the center the Luminous Mirror Spirit Lord. These three lords jointly govern the Hall of Luminosity. They wear belts adorned with four jade bells and hold jade mirrors in their mouths, the bells and mirrors all of red jade. Should a Daoist feel fear, they may visualize these three spirits causing the jade bells to chime, their sound reaching the Great Ultimate, and the mirrors to emit light for ten thousand yards. Visualizing these three lords exhaling red qi to pour into the adept’s mouth will subdue a thousand demons and extinguish ten thousand ghosts. If the Daoist feels hunger or thirst, they may absorb and swallow this qi, and in a moment exhale red qi to pour into their own mouth, then absorb and swallow it again—soon they will be sated.

Moreover, upon rising each morning, one should swallow saliva thirty times, wipe the face with the hands, and rub the eyes as a regular practice, visualizing the spittle transforming into fluid essence.

The *Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme One Heavenly Lord* states: Those who wish to visualize and absorb the qi of the sun and moon must first understand the images of the sun and moon. The sun is round in form but square in its radiance, while the moon is square in essence but round in its image. The radiance is concealed within the form, and the essence is hidden within the image. The radiance is red, the image yellow—these are the hun-souls of the sun and moon. Knowing this Dao, one may then exhale and inhale the flowing rosy clouds.

The method for absorbing solar qi: At dawn, gather the moon’s essence; at midnight, visualize it so that its light and image illuminate one’s Mud-Pellet, penetrating the five viscera and suffusing the entire body—thus may one attain long life. It is also said: Visualize the sun entering your mouth as if savoring its flavor. Visualize the moon entering your navel, descending to the Gate of Life to illuminate the chamber of yin.

It further states: Close the eyes and click the teeth five times. With the third finger of the left hand, press the philtrum beneath the nose seven times. With the second finger of the right hand, press between the brows nine times. This is the method of restraining the three, five, seven, and nine to seal and govern the gates of the hundred spirits.

The *Eight Gates Scripture of the Mysterious Mother* states: The medicines consumed by the Perfected of Great Simplicity include *Cloud-Grass of Mysterious Purity*, which is the fat of black sesame vine—also called *Mysterious Purity*. *Flower of Sweet Wine* is white honey. *Five Radiance Seven White Numinous Greens* is garlic chives. *White Essence Flying Dragon* is white quartz. The fat of black sesame and white honey congealed like snow are also mentioned. It further states: *Cloud-Fat* is fragrant, sweet, and delicious; it strengthens and replenishes essence, stabilizes the five viscera, preserves qi, and congeals fluids, nourishing the hun and po souls—it is the supreme medicine. It is also called *Mysterious Water Jade Liquid*, *Flying Dragon Cloud-Fat*, and *Refined Essence of the Five Stones*. After fifteen years of consumption, the body will emit jade-like light, internally and externally luminous, attaining long life with heaven and earth and the ability to command ghosts and spirits. After three years, one will be able to read at night. This medicine surpasses the ingestion of the eight minerals. Moreover, when the five minerals enter the throat, they refine the five viscera, causing five-colored flowers to bloom within them.

It further states: Those who regularly absorb the essence of the sun and moon should frequently eat bamboo shoots. Bamboo shoots are the embryo of solar essence—also called *Great Luminosity*. One should also eat pine needles, for the pine is the finest of trees. To absorb the sun and moon, one must consume these substances to resonate with their qi.

The Perfected of Great Void states: The pine is the finest of trees. All pines and cypresses are called *fine trees*.

The *Scripture of Great Pervasion* states: The Dao Lord disperses teachings to nourish the form, expelling the old and receiving the new, gathering essence and expelling filth. Rinsing with morning radiance to summon the Solar Sovereign, drawing in night’s brightness to embrace the Moon Pearl, knotting the luminous and absorbing the celestial, the twin effulgences unite in journey. Flying mushrooms and mysterious blossoms clothe one like a mountain’s raiment.

It further states: The Dao Lord exhales and inhales the seven darknesses, wields the six perfections with wisdom, and lodges the eight liberations to achieve far-reaching clarity. Light and unbound, the heart rests in serene simplicity, returning to the state of infancy.

It further states: The Dao Lord gazes upward to pin the sun’s radiance in the hair, gathers fallen moon pearls, plucks the crimson fruits of the forest of jade, and consumes the purple lotuses of the Mysterious River. Leaning against the numinous carriage, he governs the tiger-script.

It further states: The warm foam of the three yellows transmutes essence; the crimson liquid refines spirit. The nine jades emit their brilliance, the jade-like stones transform endlessly. Azure reflects the watery yang, the eight jades scatter their light. The lush green nectar rides the dawn’s mist, flowing gold and moon-brightness, the Mysterious Ford’s jade liquid, the numinous fat of the five lords, the scattering light-leaves of sound. One chant unfolds eight manifestations, the waves of wisdom like fire’s essence, the jade ginger of Yi and Li, the golden mirror of a hundred convergences, the refining incense of śarīra, the lush and numinous treasure—transforming and transmuting the patterns of scripture. Once the knife’s edge is arrayed, life becomes immeasurable. These are the precious medicines of the Sovereign of Primordial Perfection, the secrets of the Celestial Thearch. Some refine the five-cloud jade-flower numinous gold elixir, the vermilion soul and green lotus, the flowery fat and azure essence, the southern candle and emerald [omission], the cinnabar sand and hollow azure, gathering the five dawns’ jade abyss and pure nectar—all capable of reverting the old to the new and transforming age into infancy.

It further states: Suspend the crucible and refine five times to soften water; the nine jades merge and coalesce into jade. Fire-jade becomes pearls, flowing gold gathers jade. Aligning with the supreme contract, how could life be overturned?

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection, Fourth Scroll* states: The Perfected of the Great Ultimate consume the Cloud-Sprouts of the Four Poles, the supreme immortal method, bowing to the primal radiance of the five directions and consuming the essence of the nine rosy clouds. The commentary states: This refers to the primal qi of the clear dawn and the radiant essence of the first rosy clouds. The yang number of the sun is nine—hence the nine rosy clouds. The main text states: Thus the divine light shines internally, the vermilion flowers manifest externally, and the body generates jade-like luster. The commentary states: The form, together with the luminous, draws in the dawn’s radiance to quench thirst and consumes the essence of rosy clouds to nourish the root. The viscera and the divine light merge in brilliance; the complexion and countenance glow with the vermilion flowers. Jade-like moisture suffuses the body, harmonious qi illumines the form—all achieved by the numinous edge of the five dawns and the abyssal liquid of the six streams.

It further states: Those who obtain the ninefold jade liquid and the eightfold flying essence of fine jade unite the two luminaries at life’s end, their fate harmonizing with Heaven and Earth.

It further states: When emptiness and tranquility fill the interior, guarding the primal while swallowing saliva—this is called the True One.

It further states: Draw the divine with the six liquids and five qi.

It further states: Constantly swallow the crimson liquid to nourish the Three Palaces.

It further states: Cloud sprouts are the essence and qi of the Five Elders, the rosy mist of the Great Ultimate. Thus, one gathers the numinous edge of radiant light to harmonize the six liquids. In profound and obscure resonance, the ten thousand spirits descend; in hidden illumination, they seek one another, responding without a call.

Therefore, when the dragon intones over the abyss, rosy clouds descend from the heavens; when the tiger roars on the sacred peak, the four winds surge in all directions. The yang-burning mirror summons brightness, and vermilion fire arises in abundance; the yin-gathering vessel rarely meets shade, yet dark streams brim and overflow—naturally, their depths defy measurement. How much more so for the scholar who anchors the heart in the mysterious, refining the roots of the Dao, purging impurities from the breast, and preserving true correctness within the Three Palaces? They gather the scattered radiance of the five dawns, consume the rosy nectar of the six bodies, harvest the rare treasures of the nine heavens, and utter the arcane and wondrous secret words. Dragon brilliance leaps forth, luminous light shines sevenfold. They savor the three flowers upon their gleaming teeth, take their fill of liquid at the edge of their lips, internally refine the six viscera, and open their faculties to penetrating clarity. Inhaling and exhaling the primal of Heaven, they temper the hun and po to refine the form.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Fifth Scroll* states: The Yellow Mountain Lord’s formula says: In nurturing nature and consuming medicinal substances, one should not eat garlic or pomegranate seeds. Daoists must not partake of these, and they are also forbidden from chamber arts. Not only do these obstruct the efficacy of the medicine, but each pound consumed also diminishes one’s lifespan by a hundred days. Shen Xi’s oral formula states: When ingesting divine medicine, do not face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, one must not spit, lest one lose essence and qi, shortening lifespan and rendering the medicine’s potency as inert as earth.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Seventh Scroll* states: During the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, a woman named Wei Zi, daughter of Zhang Qing, regularly consumed mist qi. She claimed that mist qi is the flowering essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the flourishing qi of metal and stone. Prolonged consumption enables one to disperse the form and enter emptiness, merging the body with clouds and mist. Wei Zi said: She received this method from Ting Wenqi, the Jade Consort of the Eastern Sea. It further states: The female immortal Li He transmitted the rites for consuming the qi of the five planets and attaining the Dao. It further states: The immortal woman Fan Qiulin practiced gathering the radiance of the sun and moon, consuming the blossoms of the ninefold luminous mirror. It further states: Chen Shijing consumed atractylodes and the cold blossoms of alisma. It further states: When the Perfected One of the Primordial Unity first entered Mount Tiantai, he consumed sesame. It further states: Sima Jisheng consumed the blossoms of bright cinnabar, gathering the radiance of the supporting dawn, rendering his complexion like that of a twenty-year-old girl, his beard three feet long, black as ink.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Ninth Scroll* states: Gather the sun’s blossom on the left, and on the right, seize the moon’s root.

*The Inner Formula of the Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected Ones of the Upper Clarity* states: The incantation for hastening to the sun and moon reads: Consume the azure essence of the sun’s grain, drink the cloudy sapphire’s richness, feast in the city of the eight poles, ascend the terrace of luminous perfection, sit in the hall of rare groves, and chant the words of the Jade Dawn. It further states: O spirit of the sun’s soul, radiant child of the pearl’s light, let me journey west to the gate of the six ridges, enter the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn in the Woven Silk Hill’s Eight Radiance Upper Chamber. May I obtain the talisman of a thousand lights, wear the insignia of the streaming star’s night glow, sit in the Hall of Great Harmony, ascend the Terrace of the Seven Spirits, drink the moon’s blossom and cloud’s cream, consume the yellow jade’s purple nectar, chant the verses of the Most High, and recite the words of the Jade Dawn.

It further states: The formula for the Divine Elixir of the Eight Radiance and Four Blossoms of the Most High, the Crimson-Born Five-Pearl Spirit Pill—this elixir has eight names: sometimes called the Four Blossoms’ Flower, sometimes the Purple Jade Sap of the Great Tenuity, sometimes the Five-Pearl Flower Elixir, sometimes the Crimson-Born Dawn Blossom, sometimes the Three-Flower Upper Elixir, sometimes the Most High Flying Rigor, and sometimes the Nine Dawns’ Upper Elixir.

*The Arrayed Records of the Latter Sage Dao Lord* states: The Yellow Water Moon Blossom Elixir, the Returning Water Jade Essence Elixir, and the Azure Reflection Liquid of the Water Yang. Thus, the Perfected Ones of the Most High feast upon the seven awakenings and roam the ten thousand directions—truly, it is through the flying essence of the four liquids and the cinnabar sovereign of the five pearls. It further states: When spat upon the ground, it becomes the light of the sun and moon. It further states: The northern capital’s langgan blossom is the cinnabar-born elixir’s grain.

*The Scripture of the Seven Stars’ Transference* states: When thirsty, sip from the fine well’s vast spring of jade mushrooms; when hungry, ingest the dragon embryo’s fine jade and the crimson tree’s red child.

*The Scripture of the Purple Radiance of Blazing Light* states: The Nine Sovereigns’ Great Essence, the Perfected Lord of the Northern Ultimate, augment my essence-embryo, strengthen my three hun, draw the sun’s blossom on the left, and seize the moon’s essence on the right.

*The Scripture of the Dao’s Foundation and Exhalation* states: When Daoists cultivate the body through exhalation and inhalation, fasting for one ten-day period, their essence and qi grow slightly warm, their complexion sallow. By the second ten-day period, movement causes dizziness and vertigo; the limbs feel restless, defecation becomes slightly difficult, urination turns reddish-yellow, or there may be a single movement—loose in the front, hard in the back. By the third ten-day period, the body grows emaciated, and walking becomes laborious. By the fourth ten-day period, the complexion brightens, and the heart and mind find peace. By the fifth ten-day period, the five viscera harmonize, and essence and qi are internally nurtured. By the sixth ten-day period, the body returns to its former state, and the joints function smoothly. By the seventh ten-day period, the heart detests clamor and deceit, and the will aspires to lofty heights. By the eighth ten-day period, one becomes serene and tranquil, faithfully understanding the methods and arts. By the ninth ten-day period, one’s countenance becomes sleek and lustrous, and one’s voice clear and resonant. By the tenth ten-day period, essence and qi are fully present, and the effects grow daily more manifest. If cultivation continues without cease, lifespan naturally lengthens. After three years, scars and marks fade, and the complexion gains luster. After six years of cultivation, the marrow fills and the brain solidifies, and one foreknows life and death.

After nine years of practice, one commands ghosts and spirits, and is titled a "Perfected Person," assisting the Supreme August One above. One’s lifespan aligns with Heaven, and one’s radiance merges with the sun. Should the teachings be transmitted to the unworthy, the transgressor bears the calamity.

*The Celestial Writings of the Upper Canon* speaks of the Dragon-Embryo Golden Elixir of Nine Refinements, which preserves form and dispenses with grain, repelling the myriad deviations. The Five-Titled Master’s ritual includes the Purple Court Golden Night.

*The Jade Instructions, Lower Scroll* states: The Primordial Five Qi invariably ascend at cock’s crow to assemble at the Numinous Treasure Jade Mountain in the Mystic Capital’s Upper Palace. As the yang light first brightens, it scatters the radiance of the Primordial Beginning, surveying the myriad heavens. Its qi is lush and dense, its brilliance warm and pervasive, its essence like moon-pearls, its light like purple clouds. The qi revolves like a chariot’s wheel, ascending to govern the passes of the Nine Heavens, centrally securing the numinous mountains of the Five Emperors.

The appended note reads: The roots of the Five Teeth of the Learned Scholar, the Great Wisdom Perfected of the Upper Palace, and the host of sages all partake of this radiance at its appointed time, inhaling its essence aloft. In harmony with Heaven, they attain boundlessness. Later sagely Daoists, who abstain from grain, maintain long fasts on the Five Peaks, sever ties with the dusty world, and aspire to purity and truth, may daily ingest the solar root’s rosy dawn and swallow the sun’s essence. They swiftly perceive their bodies suffused with jade-like luster, their faces aglow, and ascend to the rank of Jade Sovereign.

*The Scripture of Guiding and Absorbing the Three Luminaries* states: The Three Luminaries are named Flowing Essence, Luminous Infant, Dharma Qi, Yang King, Cloud Blossom, Guiding Immortal, Nine Transformations, and Settled Radiance—these refer to the immortal arts of embryo refinement through the Three Luminaries.

*The Transmission of Daoist Learning, Scroll Two* records: Xu Mai, styled Shu Xuan, was originally named Ying in his youth but later changed his name. He wandered into Xincheng Daoshan, consuming the valley’s *ju* vine and seeds, and practiced qi-absorption, sustaining a single breath for over a thousand cycles. In the second year of the Jin Yonghe reign, he relocated to the Western Mountains of Lin’an. It further states: Yan Xuanzhi of Gaoping and Peng Chu of Langye both sought instruction from Xu Mai. Xu Mai said, "Master Yan may practice qi-absorption to cease grain consumption. Master Peng should take herbs to augment his qi." He then taught Peng to ingest *zhu* (atractylodes) and entrusted him with the method. After three years of devoted service, Xu Mai said, "You have grasped this; you need only cultivate diligently." With single-minded devotion, their hearts became like dead ashes, their forms like discarded husks. Each was to seek a secluded place to refine their essence. Thereupon, Xuanzhi went to Qian to focus on ingesting *zhu*.

Scroll Three further records: Wang Jia, styled Zinian, a native of Longxi, dwelled in a cave hewn into the cliffs of Dongyang Valley. He consumed no grains, wore no fine garments, and practiced pure emptiness and qi-absorption, shunning worldly intercourse. Yao Chang and Murong sought him, but he did not respond.

*The True Reports, Scroll Five* states: Fan Youzhong of Liaoxi was the Supervisor of Huayang. He underwent embryonic transformation and shape-shifting, and now resides here, perpetually absorbing the Three Qi. The method of the Three Qi involves visualizing blue, white, and red qi, each like a bowstring descending from the eastern sun into the mouth, drawing it in ninety times until sated. After a decade of practice, the three-colored qi spontaneously arise within the body, and one attains transcendence. This is the High Prime Lord’s method of the Inner Effulgences of Grand Simplicity. Practicing it daily with eyes closed yields ever-improving results.

The Jade Maiden of Eastern Sea’s Eastern Flower, Ting Wenqi, transmitted the Mist-Swallowing Method to the Female Perfected of Containing Truth Terrace, Zhang Weizi. At dawn, in quiet repose, one may sit or lie as preferred. First, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the hair and temples until the five viscera are seen. Then exhale through the mouth twenty-four times. As one performs this, the eyes perceive five-colored qi coiling around the face. With prolonged practice, one habitually rides clouds and mist in travel.

It further states: In practicing the Way of Preserving the Mysterious and White, at dawn one sits or lies as desired, visualizing black qi in the Mud-Pellet Palace, white qi in the heart, and yellow qi in the navel. The three qi arise together like clouds covering the body, then transform into fire that burns the body, rendering it translucent and unified inside and out. The practice continues until midday, concluding with 120 qi-absorptions. The Dao is thus complete, granting longevity, averting disasters, and repelling harm. It strictly prohibits wine, meat, and the five pungent flavors. One should dwell apart in quiet contemplation, especially avoiding sexual intercourse, for it leads to death.

It further states: In learning the Dao, one must only seek to silence the breath and nurture the spirit, drawing the breath to its utmost and exhaling gently. One must not speak loudly or shout, lest the spirit be wearied and depleted. Such practices do not nurture life.

*The True Reports, Genuine Mandates, Scroll Four* states: The body soars on high, tasting the mysterious and savoring the real. Drawing in the radiant luminaries, the Six Spirits congeal in stillness. The Eight Brilliances shine forth, submitting to the numinous root. Sorrows and burdens do not disturb the Mystic Abode; grief and longing do not agitate the Crimson Ford.

*The True Reports, Scroll Seven* states: Fan Youchong of Liaoxi underwent embryonic transformation and shape-shifting, and now resides here, perpetually practicing the method of the blue, red, and white Three Qi, thereby attaining transcendence. It further states: Xu Zongdu of Jinling received the qi-restraining Way from the Master of Wind Valley. It also records: Long Shu, styled Bogao, a man of the Later Han, learned the method of ingesting embryonic qi from the immortal Diao Daolin. He shed his form and departed, concealing himself on Fangtai, where his master was the Recorder of Destinies. There was also Liu Aping, who dwelt in a grotto on Fangshan, perpetually absorbing the morning qi of the sun and moon. His complexion was like jade, and he appeared to be about thirty years old.

*The Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: In the ancient Chanli world, King Dui had a daughter named Guayin who, at fourteen, had never spoken. The king abandoned her in a desolate mountain. With no provisions, she daily faced the sun to swallow qi and drew in the moon’s essence, naturally sustaining herself without bodily decline.

*The Cavernous Numinous Chapters* states:
At dawn, ingest the qi of the Five Clouds;
at dusk, chant the Three Morning Lights.

It further records:
Feast on qi to fill the long mounds,
swallow saliva as golden water blooms.
Seal the night to pluck the decayed frame—
restore youth to teeth of ivory white.
The body enters the kalpa of no death,
its name inscribed in the Jade Numinous Capital.

*The Nine Songs of the Eight Yang Essences* declares:
Seven-jeweled jade grains, golden elixir,
purple rays concealed in lingzhi—
gather with the left, pluck with the right,
night-glowing phoenix brain,
tiger foam, cloud jade,
exquisite frost, rare flavors—
one taste and the body brushes the Great Void.

*The Hidden Writ of the Rushing Sun and Moon’s Two Radiant Forms* states:
Drink the moon’s flowery cloud cream,
consume the essence of yellow jade and purple perfection.

*The Second Scroll of the Traditions of Daoist Learning* records:
In place of rock candy cakes, use stalactites.
These two substances both arise from the moisture of stones.
This appears in the *Biography of Xu Mai*.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states:
King Mu of Zhou journeyed north to Kunlun,
where he drank the crimson mountain’s stone marrow
and ate the fruit of the jade tree.

*The Third Scroll of the Traditions of Daoist Learning* records:
Yan Ji, styled Zhongwei, lived at the end of Emperor Ming’s reign in the Han.
From youth he cherished the Dao and virtue,
and never served in the world.

At first entering Mount Huayin, he consumed tree saplings, great yellow essence, cultivated mica, realgar, cinnabar, and zhi grasses.

*The Fourteenth Scroll* states: Shuang Xi, styled Zhongyuan, was a man of the Liang dynasty. Initially, after abstaining from grains, he grew emaciated. A wealthy man, Fan Xin, requested him to identify efficacious herbs and provided servants to gather them. Soon after, he regained his strength. The water buffalo given by the Fan family had plowed the mountains for many years.

*The Twentieth Scroll* states: The female official Xiao Zhen, a native of Dantu in Donghai, left home in her youth to study the Dao in Yishan, consuming only cypress leaves.

*The Upper Scroll of the Biographies of the Immortals* states: Chi Jiang Ziyu was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. He did not eat the five grains but consumed the flowers of a hundred herbs. Another, Wo Quan, was a herb-gatherer from Mount Huai. Fond of eating pine nuts, his body grew hair several inches long, his eyes became square, and he could fly to keep pace with galloping horses.

Master Luli received the *Mountain-Hidden Numinous Treasure Formulae*:
First, the *Flying Turtle Mat of Yi and Luo*;
Second, the *White Yu’s Correct Mechanism*;
Third, the *Balanced Pressing Union*.
Consuming these daily restores youth. One could walk five hundred li in a day, lift a thousand斤, shed skin ten times in a year, and finally ascend as an immortal.

*The Inner Transmission of the Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness* states: The Lord of the Dao of Immortals bestowed upon Lord Wang two sheng of *Cloud Azure Yang Water* and *Morning-Flown Cinnabar Fat*. Lord Wang bowed and consumed them. Over nine years, he could see ten thousand li away, walk three thousand li in a day, sit and vanish at will, and command a host of spirits.

*The Licorice Pill Formula* from the transmission of Lady Wei of Mount Nanyue:

First, six liang of licorice.
Second, three liang of cinnabar, of the finest quality.
Third, five liang of rhubarb.
Fourth, seven liang of dried rehmannia.
Fifth, ten liang of white wood.
Sixth, five liang of schisandra.
Seventh, five liang of ginseng.
Eighth, four liang of poria.
Ninth, three liang of tangkuei.
Tenth, four liang of asparagus.
Eleventh, two liang of stephania.
Twelfth, three liang of polyporus.
Thirteenth, two liang of asarum.
Fourteenth, two liang of cassia seeds.

For these fourteen ingredients, use only the freshest and finest herbs; do not employ stale or aged ones. First, grind each finely without sifting, then weigh the powders to ensure the correct liang. Place them in a mortar in order, beginning with licorice, and pound one thousand times. Next, add cinnabar and pound another thousand times. Continue adding each ingredient in sequence, pounding one thousand times after each addition. In total, the fourteen herbs require sixteen thousand poundings, amounting to thirty thousand poundings in all.

Once the medicine is prepared, form it into honeyed pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take ten pills after meals, beginning with a small dose; up to thirty pills may be taken. This medicine internally eradicates illness, is non-toxic, and has no prohibitions. Consuming it for a year yields great benefit; do not expect immediate results. Women who take it will bear many children and suffer no illnesses. Prolonged consumption leads to immortality and deathlessness.

Prepare the medicine in a separate, clean room. Do not allow many people to witness the process. Bathe, purify yourself, and maintain a fast for three or four days before grinding the ingredients. It cures a hundred afflictions and a thousand diseases; their names cannot all be recorded here. As for the practices of consuming medicines and guiding qi, the various scriptures contain much on this; it will not be repeated here.

*Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns, Scroll Three*
*Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns, Scroll Four*

**Master Wang Xuanhe of Luhai, Feathered Guest of the Great Tang, on the Art of Grain Abstention**

*The Sixth Scroll of Accounts of Daoist Learning* states: Chu Boyu, styled Yuanqu, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery. He secluded himself on Mount Huo, refining essences and ingesting mist, and for many years abstained from grain.

*The Scripture on Exhalation and Inhalation* says: Grain abstention is the Way of the primordial spirit. When one first practices qi-ingestion for one or two days, the grain-qi has not yet stabilized, and the complexion appears dull and sallow. By the third day, grain-qi departs, and essence-qi arrives. On the fourth and fifth days, essence-qi harmonizes yin and yang. By the sixth day, spirit and essence settle, the ears and eyes grow keen, steps become nimble, and the body daily strengthens. On the seventh day, one constantly desires to ascend lightly—such is the effect of the supreme Way. In dreams and waking, one faintly perceives communion with divine luminosity. By the eighth day, the spirit roams the eight extremities; one can act in silence, the mouth naturally savors sweetness, and the will and bones strengthen of themselves. On the ninth day, spirit and essence are complete; the weak in form grow strong, and the spirit-qi daily solidifies. Without movement, one travels afar; without approach, one draws near. The complexion daily brightens. By the tenth day, all spirits arrive, the gates are sealed, jade maidens attend, and one ascends lightly to either side, drifting like a heron in the clouds—thus is the Way attained.

It further states: The Way treasures essence as its jewel. Bestowed, it gives life to others; retained, it gives life to the self. Life to the self ensures eternal transcendence—this is the rank of a worldly immortal. Bestowing life to others is the fulfillment of merit, after which one retreats into reclusion. The vulgar deem this arduous; how much worse to forget bestowal and cast it aside, wasting much through lack of study, thus aging and forfeiting life! Lord Lao said: Essence is the river that flows through the blood vessels. When essence departs, one withers and ages—hence its value. The human body is a state; spirit is its ruler, essence its minister, and qi its people. Constantly cherishing essence is the essential Way.

Lord Lao said: The Way is qi. Treasuring qi is to attain the Way; attaining the Way is to endure long. Spirit is essence. Treasuring essence is to attain spirit luminosity; attaining spirit luminosity is to attain long life.

It further states: The Way of long life treasures essence as its jewel, for essence is that by which humans are born. Essence is the treasure—hence it is called the Way. The Way of a single day: sated at dawn, hungry at dusk. The Way of a single month: not losing its waxing and waning. The Way of a single year: lean in summer, plump in winter. The Way of a hundred years: moderating grain and eating jujubes. The Way of a thousand years: solitary man, no woman. This is called long life and enduring vision—none can count its measure. The above passages all derive from the foundations of the Way.

*The Scripture on Exhalation and Inhalation* further states: I have heard the Eight Lords say: Those who eat plants gain strength; those who eat meat gain courage; those who eat grain gain wisdom; those who eat qi gain spirit. The sage, who eats nothing, does not die.

*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: When immortals and Daoists ingest qi, it is not due to divine power but to the accumulation of essence and the focus of harmonious qi. All people eat grain and the five flavors; I alone consume the great harmony of yin-yang qi—thus I do not die. Resting the root and eating qi is the Way of life; returning essence through yin and yang is the supreme treasure. How fortunate to cultivate the body and attain longevity! Yet some vainly yearn for distant things, believing them nonexistent, and thus revert to folly, hastening old age. A thousand gold pieces spent on burial bring no benefit; grief, wailing, and lamentation only bring remorse. Nothing compares to long life as the greatest good. Thus, the essentials of the Way are few in words and brief in writing. If the brush falls upon truth, cultivate it without falsehood, and you will ascend to Great Wu without ceasing.

*The One Hundred Twentieth Scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace* states: Therefore, those who eat have a fixed term of life; those who do not eat conspire with the spirits. Those who eat qi attain spirit luminosity; those who neither drink nor eat complete their years with Heaven and Earth.

*The One Hundred Forty-Fifth Scroll* states:
Question: What do those of the upper, middle, and lower ranks who attain the Way and transcend the world consume?
Answer: The highest of the upper rank consume wind and qi; the second rank consume medicinal flavors; the third rank eat sparingly to clear their intestines and stomachs.

It further states: Heaven is distant and boundless. Without consuming wind and qi, how can one move swiftly and circulate through the Way of Heaven? One must also communicate merit with spirit officials, forming companionship—hence the consumption of wind and qi. Next, one should join forces with the essence of Earth, harmonizing the five soils, traversing high and low mountains and rivers, entering water along the mountains, and mutually communicating with Earth, sharing in its merit. One cannot eat grain—hence one drinks water and travels. Those who practice moderation in eating as the Way have not yet fully formed their semblance; they differ only slightly from ordinary people. Thus, eating sparingly to clear the intestines is also a means to attain the Way.

*The Scripture of the Foundations of the Way* states: Consuming medicinal herbs and eating wheat is excellent! In ancient times, the Daoist Gan Shi ingested qi and ate wheat to transcend the world.

It further states: One who unites with the Way does not speak of attainment; the true one remains awake day and night without sleep. Sun and moon merge their light; one is neither hungry nor thirsty—this is the breathing of the tortoise and dragon embryo.

It further states: Those who eat grain are called grain immortals. If they practice without ceasing, they may prolong their years. Those who do not eat grain may ascend through the clouds and transcend the world, attaining deathlessness.

*The Inner Transmission of the Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness* states: The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: Those who receive life-qi from the five grains form embryos and nurture beings, inevitably embracing the flowing essence of grain-qi. Uniting with the myriad transformations of the true also refines the mysterious moisture of the five grains. Like a child lodging in its parents, one relies on what gives life to grasp life itself. If one does not follow the original source of what gives life but abruptly abandons its foundation, has there ever been one who did not wither in partial vision and sever their years, withering away? All should follow their origin, comply with its flow, refine and harmonize it, subtly dispersing the root. Thus, the constructive and defensive qi are easily refined in daily use, and the six viscera transform grain gradually. Therefore, relying on grain is the excellent art of employing life; following the root to depart from the root is the wondrous trace of grasping illumination.

Thus, fanning the eastern radiance of the southern candle, summoning the vermilion spirit of the nascent sprout, the five fluids become serene and still, the hundred passages fill and overflow. The spirit delights in the three palaces, the hun-soul softens and the po-soul settles into tranquility. Further invigorated by morning rinsing with the blossoming spring, the five directions’ ethereal essence, drumming the jade pool, and inhaling the mysterious essence, the radiant fatness flourishes in the □ direction, the stomach fills and is steadied by the void azure. Therefore, a thousand calculations unfold as one, longevity flourishes with the years, and with each year the elixir advances—one ascends the immortal court in flying steps.

Those who consume a full dose will never again face the collapse of life. Five-colored clouds arise around the body, and the bodily spirit, qi, and essence are all refined. They may eat nine times in a single day, the hundred passages flowing smoothly, or go a full year without hunger. Returning from old age to infancy, they eat when encountering food and remain at ease when not—this is the wondrous method of the highest immortals, the marvelous numen of grain-abstention.

The aforementioned "southern candle" is an immortal herb. Though its form is woody, it resembles a grass, hence it is called the "southern candle grass-wood." It is also named "monkey medicine," "male continuance," "posterior brilliance," "Weina wood," and "king of grasses and trees." It grows on Song Gao’s Shaoshi Peak and Baidu’s Jitou Mountain, and its methods of ingestion have already been recorded in the *Register of Dietary Practices*. This formula also appears in the *Dengzhen Yinjue* (Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection), Scroll Ten. The previous dietary practices described therein are largely similar to this, with only minor differences.

The *Scripture on Exhalation and Inhalation for Daoist Foundations* states: Those who abstain from grains, cease rice consumption, and consume only pure substances must not drink wine, for it causes confusion, knotting the qi and vessels, obstructing the hundred meridians. It generates heat—better not to drink at all, that one may remain pure and undefiled.

The *Supreme Yellow Plain Scripture of Forty-Four Methods* states: All Daoists who absorb harmonious qi, preserve the spirit, ingest the radiance, and pursue longevity must carefully avoid the five pungent vegetables and the corruptions of wine and lust. Thus did the divine beings of old say: The five pungents are the axes that hew at the storehouses of life; wine and lust are the coffin and outer casket that bury the body. Only by severing the harm wrought by axes and sealing the deathly abode of coffin and casket may one ascend the path to longevity and gradually tread the trail to divine transcendence.

The *Scripture of Boundless Transformation* states: Those who eat meat and the five pungents—no spirit will dwell within their bodies.

The *True Record of the Golden Book* states: Consuming the five pungents mars the countenance of immortality. The five pungents are: scallion, garlic, leek, Chinese chive, and *xingqu* (the latter now obscure in common usage).

The *Register of Divine Elixirs and Immortal Medicines* and the twenty-ninth section, "Hidden Mountain Grade," of the ninth scroll of *Dietary Practices* both list the names of immortal herbs.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Eight Radiant, Four-Blossomed, Purple-Essence, Five-Pearled, Crimson-Born Spirit Elixir* states:

First, Crimson Mound Vermilion Child—*Oral Instructions* say this is cinnabar, the finest essence from Ba and Yue.
Second, Cinnabar Mountain Sun-Soul—*Oral Instructions* say this is realgar, selected for its cavernous luminosity.
Third, Mystic Terrace Cinnabar Flower—*Oral Instructions* say this is orpiment.

Twentieth, Majestic Pattern Central King—*Oral Instructions* say this is tiger brain.
Twenty-First, Submerged Brilliance Converging Radiance—*Oral Instructions* say this is pearl from within a clam.
Twenty-Second, Zhangyang Feather Mystery—*Oral Instructions* say this is white aconite.
Twenty-Third, Green Hidden Stone Mother—*Oral Instructions* say this is magnetite.
Twenty-Fourth, Central Mountain Abundant Fat—*Oral Instructions* say this is *Taiyi*’s remnant root, taking the yellow from its center.

These twenty-four ingredients combine to form the Eight Radiant, Four-Blossomed, Five-Pearled, Crimson-Born Spirit Elixir. Ingesting one *liang* of this elixir will cause nine morning lights to sprout from the head, the face to bear jade radiance, and flying reflections of precious luminosity to illuminate all beneath heaven. One will ascend to the Purple Void, enter and exit the Jade Purity, and repose in the Morning Chamber.

The *Supreme One’s Numinous Elixir of Cloud-Petal Jade Dust* states: The flourishing fruit is the bright pearl of spring’s awakening. Sesame is the profound numen of autumn’s clarity. Cinnabar jujube is the cloud fungus of flourishing yang. Poria is the crimson dawn’s hidden embryo. When the five flowers merge with mist and the three qi refine the essence, the six qi are harmonized, the hun-souls nurtured, and the spirit guarded. Those who obtain this method will become Heavenly Immortals, their aged white returning to the mysterious, their infant visage restored, their countenance that of a youth. A thousand harms will not assail them, and their lifespan will extend ten thousand years.

It further states: The method of the Mystic Water Cloud-Essence Elixir is also called the Vermilion Essence of Flourishing Clouds. Consuming five *ge* daily will make the body fragrant and the face bear the radiance of youth—this is a divine transcendence method.

It further states: The Supreme One’s Four Guardians Pill generates spirit in the five viscera, guards the six bones, nourishes the seven orifices, harmonizes the nine barriers, refines the three hun-souls, brightens the two pupils, preserves the one body, and grants longevity of ten thousand years.

It further states: The Three Spirits Dragon Bone benefits the six fluids, nourishes the nine intestines, and halts the whitening of black hair.

The Supreme One’s Pill and Powder Method of Sweet Flag states: It guards the center and refines the spirit, granting longevity and enduring vision, filling and congealing the bone marrow, replenishing the brain’s blood. With prolonged consumption, the complexion becomes purple like that of a young maiden. Another name is Nine Cycles of Primordial Essence. Sweet flag is also called the *changyang* numinous herb.

All the above are drawn from the *Inner Instructions of the Supreme Purity’s Nine Perfected* as their foundation.

The *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* contains the Nine Cycles Frost Snow, Jade-Tooth Flower Elixir, Returning White Jade Mystic Water, Flowing Gold Liquid Essence, Jade Grove Congealed Flower, Sun-Moon Water—all methods for ascending to heaven in broad daylight as a flying immortal.

It further states: The Immortal Mother’s Gold Elixir, also called the Queen Mother of the West’s Age-Halting, Old-Age-Reversing Flying Elixir, grants immortality to those who consume it, their faces bearing the youthful countenance of a maiden.

The *Scripture of Purple Radiance and Blazing Light* states: The Flying Elixir’s purple flower and flowing essence possess a hundred shifting hues.

It further states: The ointment of jade embryo and jasper liquid.

The *Scripture of Flying and Soaring Feathers* states: The ointment of refined gold essence—consuming a single mouthful grants a lifespan of seventy thousand years.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Great Ultimate Lord’s Guarding Life and the Five Viscera* states: The cloud herb of mysterious clarity is the fat of black sesame, also called Mystic Clarity. The blossoming nectar of herbs is white honey. The five lights and seven whites of numinous vegetables are Chinese chives. White Simplicity Flying Dragon is white quartz, also found in the *Nine Perfected’s Inner Instructions*.

The *Arrayed Records of the Latter Sage Dao Lord* states: The Jade-Tooth Flower Elixir is a medicinal species. Crimson Mound Vermilion Child, ten *jin*—*Oral Instructions* say this is cinnabar. Cinnabar Mountain Sun-Soul, five *jin*—*Oral Instructions* say this is realgar. White Simplicity Flying Dragon, one *jin*—*Oral Instructions* say this is white quartz. Azure Essence Jade Maiden, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is malachite. Purple Mound Patterned Marquis, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is purple quartz. Azure City Flying Flower, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is azurite. Northern Emperor Mystic Vermilion, one *jin*—*Oral Instructions* say this is saltpeter. Nine Spirits Yellow Youth, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is sulfur. Five Essences Metal Ram, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is actinolite. Cloud Flower Flying Petal, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is mica.

White Tiger Shedding Teeth, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is gold-tooth stone. Flowing Cinnabar White Cream, one *jin*—*Oral Instructions* say this is lead powder. Reversing Spirit Bone, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is halite. Dark Terrace Moon Essence, five *liang*—*Oral Instructions* say this is orpiment.

Together these fourteen flowering elixirs, when refined into one *liang*, become One Immortal. White Flower has one name: *Zhangju*; one name: *Zhangming*; one name: *Zhangsheng*; one name: *Zhangcao*; one name: *Zhanglu*; one name: *Tongshen*; one name: *Tongjing*; one name: *Tongling*; one name: *Royal Maiden*; one name: *Household Immortal*; one name: *Household Treasure*; one name: *Household Zhi*; one name: *Extending Life*; one name: *Longevity Herb*; one name: *Guardian of the Palace*; one name: *Guardian of the Homestead*. The Twelve Divisions have one name: *Night Call*; one name: *Night Cry*; one name: *Inducing Essence*; one name: *Yang Brightness*; one name: *Yin Brightness*; one name: *Red Kudzu*; one name: *Danglu*.

Altogether twenty-four names, corresponding above to the twenty-four qi of Heaven and Earth. Ingesting a *fangcun*-spoonful enables communion with spirits and attracts fortune.

*The Esoteric Transmission of Wen Shi* states: Laozi, traveling east with the Pass Keeper, ascended the Sun Cavern’s Ever-Bright Mountain, plucked the cinnabar mulberries of Fusang, and scattered the vermilion blossoms of the forest like stars.

*The Fourth Scroll of Daoist Biographies* states: Jiaozhi produced the cinnabar gathered by Ge Hong. The fourteenth scroll records: Shuang Xizu, styled Zhongyuan, during the fourteenth year of Liang Emperor Wu’s *Tianjian* era, personally journeyed to Wuling to seek cinnabar. He distributed both public and private funds, amounting to several tens of *jin* of gold, all to relieve the destitute.

**Elixir Furnaces and Incense Burners**

*The Fourteenth Scroll of the Cavernous Spirit Canon* states: When ingesting cinnabar and burning incense, use five incense burners. *The Scripture of Great Cavern True Script, Zhi Elixir, Azure Jade Burner, and Refined Root of Supple Vajra* also appears in *The Arrayed Records of the Three Heavenly Lords of Highest Clarity*.

*The Concealed Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: Regarding the incense burner for burning incense, no one describes its form or mold. The ancients often used *boshan* burners and tripods. *The Eight Mighties’ Dragon-Summoning Scripture* mentions the *boshan* incense burner.

*The Upper Scroll of the Great Perfection Regulations* states: The Lofty Mystery Terrace has a great incense burner, five *chi* in height, perpetually burning incense without the smoke ever ceasing.

*The Sixth Scroll of the Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: Jade lads scatter wondrous blossoms; jade maidens present the incense burner. The third scroll states: The Seven Treasures Terrace has a seven-jeweled incense burner, burning myriad wondrous incenses, their fragrance suffusing boundlessly.

*The Third Scroll of the Scripture of the Ocean of Emptiness* states: At that time, the Ocean of Emptiness’ Wisdom Treasury arose, adjusted his robe at his seat, held the incense burner, stood reverently facing the Heavenly Worthy, his gaze unwavering, his mind free of distraction.

*The Upper Scripture of Astronomy* states: The sun and moon hang their radiance; the golden burner stands lofty—sometimes at the Gate of Separation, sometimes in the Palace of Destiny.

*The True Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* states: Immortals know only how to fly elixirs and summon frost, to smelt cinnabar clouds, to dissolve gold with water-jade, and to blaze the nine furnaces to the heavens.

*The Tenth Scroll of Daoist Biographies* states: Dongxiang Zongchao, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. Once, while performing the Dao at an open-air altar, the incense in the censer suddenly overflowed when the *lian* note sounded. Again, though no fire burned in the burner, smoke arose of its own accord, filling the space and lingering long without dissipating.

The fourteenth scroll records: Shuang Xizu, styled Zhongyuan, lived during the Liang dynasty. Fond of reading scriptures, he never let them leave his hands. When the Marquis of Linru was appointed as the Pure Envoy to Jingzhou, his attendants placed an incense burner before Xizu and departed without a word.

The fifteenth scroll states: Tao Hongjing sealed the Three True Treasure Scriptures in a tin casket and cast them into a cliffside cavern. He also placed a pure gold magpie-tailed incense burner beside the scriptures for their veneration.

The twentieth scroll states: The Daoist nun Song Yuxian was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. Though born a woman, her resolve was not her own. When she reached marriageable age, her parents betrothed her to the Xu family. Secretly, she prepared ritual garments. Upon arriving at her husband’s home, during the Six Rites, she donned a yellow cloth skirt and coarse hemp robe, held a magpie-tailed incense burner, and refused to partake in the wedding rites. The guests and hosts were astonished, but the husband’s family could not compel her. She was cast out and returned home, thus becoming a renunciate.

*The Upper Scripture of the Great Kalpa* states: Heavenly maidens hold the fragrant trays of the Net of Heaven, bearing jade burners, burning the incense of the Nine Harmonies.

*Volume Four of the Three Caverns’ Pearl Satchel* concludes.
*Volume Five of the Three Caverns’ Pearl Satchel* begins.

The *Sitting-in-Forgetfulness and Refined Contemplation* by Wang Xuanhe, the Feathered Guest of the Vast Sea of Lu in the Great Tang

The *Nanhua [Zhuangzi]*, "On the Equality of Things, Second Chapter," states: Nan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest and sat, gazing upward and exhaling with a sigh, as if he had lost his counterpart. The sixth chapter says: Cast off the limbs, dim the hearing and sight, depart from form and abandon knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called sitting-in-forgetfulness. The fourth chapter says: Maim the form, and one will not be conscripted for labor; how much more so if one maims their virtue? It also says: Do not listen with the ears, do not listen with the heart, but listen with qi. Qi is emptiness awaiting things. When the empty chamber generates brightness, auspiciousness abides therein.

*The Second Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: Master Zhang the Celestial Master roamed the Five Peaks, refining his contemplation and accumulating resonance. The Perfected descended, and the Dao was accomplished, earning him the title Celestial Master.

Volume Five cites *Records of Assembled Immortals*: Liu Ningzhi, styled Zhi’an, with the childhood name Longevity, was a native of Zhijiang in Nanjun. Devoted to the Dao with diligent progress, in the fourteenth year of Yuanjia, while in refined contemplation, he suddenly felt a sharp pain on his forehead. Scratching it, he obtained nine precious pearls, which he floated in clear water, illuminating the entire chamber. At that time, the Prince of Linchuan was stationed in Jiangling and sought to see the pearls, so Liu gave three to his messenger.

*The Scripture of Daoist Traces* states: The Green Lad said: In refined contemplation, one must first burn incense to the left and right.

*The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Eight Effulgences* says: Refine contemplation for a hundred days, and Perfected Ones will descend in form. Immortals will visit your chamber, converse with you, bestow upon you the elixir of transcendence, and transmit to you the Way of the Divine Perfected.

*Preface to the Scripture of the Five Thousand Characters by Lord Ge the Immortal* says: Through refined contemplation and distant resonance, the Supreme Dao Lord dispatched Perfected Ones to bestow the *Scripture of the Five Thousand Characters* upon Emperor Wen, its subtleties profound. It also says: In tranquil contemplation, awaiting the Perfected, the myriad wonders converge in response. Inwardly observing one’s form and shadow, spirit and qi endure long. When the body harmonizes with the Dao and virtue, the ten thousand spirits tremble in submission, calamities vanish in the Nine Yin, blessings arise in the Ten Directions, and the nation and family are at peace—who can fathom this?

The *Zhuangzi*, "The Great Master" chapter, says: Sitting-in-forgetfulness means casting off the limbs, dimming hearing and sight, departing from form and abandoning knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare. This is also the meaning of refined contemplation.

The *Nanhua Treatise*, "On the Equality of Things," also says: Nan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest and sat, sighing as if he had lost his counterpart. Thus, his movements were like dragging withered wood, and his sitting was like a heap of dead ashes. This, too, is the meaning of refined contemplation.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states: The Daoist of the Five Spirits, Zhi Ziyuan, in a quiet chamber refined his contemplation, visualizing the Five Stars above his head: Jupiter on the left, Venus on the right, Mars at his knees, and Saturn in his heart, each emitting radiant qi and color. Practicing this for a long time, whether going out or traveling afar, he never forgot to contemplate, and nothing could withstand him. These five spirits, when united with the human body, enable one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

*The Inner Transmission of Lord Pei* states: The Buddhist Daoist Zhi Ziyuan received from Lord Pei the inner arts of longevity. It also says: Seeking herbs and refined contemplation, though both lead to the Dao along the same stream, differ in their origins. Ingesting herbs preserves the form, and when the form is sound, the spirit is at peace. Refined contemplation pacifies the spirit, and when the spirit is unimpeded, the form is preserved. These two principles mutually support each other, yet there are grades of superiority. Now, fearing the spirit’s leakage while the form is abandoned, refined contemplation is deemed superior. No one has seen the form depart while the spirit remains, so ingesting herbs is considered inferior. Those who attain the Dao through one practice alone also reach the shore of the Way, yet it is not as perfect as combining both, allowing herbs and contemplation to work in tandem, form and spirit to merge. Then, like adding fuel to extend the day, the blade moves without obstruction, the course of life is naturally established, and the realm of death cannot arise.

*The Fifth [Scroll] of True Reports* says: Ordinary people should constantly visualize their own form in refined contemplation, making it as vivid as possible, appearing before them. Have the light of the sun and moon perpetually shine upon the face, illuminating the entire form, with the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine inches before the face. Once the visualization is complete, click the teeth three times and softly recite: "The Primordial Womb’s Upper Perfected, Twin Effulgences of the Three Mysteries, restrain the seven po on the right, bind the three hun on the left, so that my spirit and luminosity may abide with my form forever." Afterward, click the teeth twenty-one times and swallow saliva twenty-one times. This is called the Way of the August Lord’s Recording of Form and Binding of the Hun, enabling one to become a spiritually luminous immortal and live forever without dying. If one cannot recite the incantation, visualization alone is also permissible.

*The Seventh [Scroll] of True Reports* states: The Immortal Zhang Weizi was the daughter of Zhang Qing from the time of Emperor Zhao of Han. Once, in quiet seclusion, she refined her contemplation with sincere devotion, and the Jade Consort of Eastern Florescence from the Eastern Sea, Ting Wenqi, descended to her, bestowing the Way of Ingesting Mist. The method of ingesting mist originated from this.

It also says: Ping Zhongjie of Kuocang Mountain, a Daoist from Hedong, received from his master, Master Song, the Way of the Heart-Mirror. After forty-five years of such practice, his refined contemplation made his body grow younger, and his form possessed true qi. The Central Yellow Elder dispatched an envoy to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and dragons. He now resides in the Cloud Terrace of Canglang.

It also says: Fan Boci, a native of Guiyang, entered Tianmu Mountain to ingest herbs and consume sesame. After seventeen years of refined contemplation, the Supreme Perfected Lord of Life and Destiny descended and bestowed thirty-six scrolls of scriptures. Later, he ingested the returning elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, now known as the Perfected of the Mysterious Unity.

*The Records of the Golden Perfected of the Great One* states: Once, Lord Pei resided on Kongtong Mountain, cultivating refined contemplation. In the first year, his form became faint and indistinct. In the second year, the Five Thearchs rode the sun, their forms appearing at his left and right.

In the third year, he laughed and played in joy throughout the day. In the fifth year, the Five Thearchs and the Sun Lords then accompanied Lord Pei in riding the flying dragon chariot, journeying east to the Heaven of the Sun’s Cavern, the Palace of Fusang on the Eastern Mengchang Long Mound, the City of the Eight Poles. They ascended the Terrace of Illuminating Perfection, sat in the Hall of Sparse Forest, and were bestowed the Nine Talismans of the Wielding Spirit and the Symbols of the Nine Provinces. They consumed the Azure Essence of the Sun’s Nourishment and drank the Empty Azure Mysterious Spirit. From then on, they roamed daily with the Five Thearchs and the Sun Lords. This is called the Way of Chasing the Sun.

*The Scripture of the Seventy-Four Transformations of the Supreme Clarity* states: If one can refine contemplation in a quiet chamber, cast aside worldly burdens, and sincerely focus on the vision of the Great Radiance, gazing upon the palaces of the Supreme Clarity, stabilizing qi through settled stillness, and calming the spirit within the Great Void, then within ten days one will behold the spirits, and within a year one will soar aloft. Accumulated resonance stirs within an inch, and transformations flourish upon the peaks of the clouds. One surveys the limits of the hundred spheres and masters the seventy-four wondrous transformations of the Dao. Blessings are immeasurable—these are the noble practices of the divine scriptures and the supreme esoteric formulas of the highest immortals.

It also says: If one can pacify the heart in the chamber, contemplate the divine countenance in its natural state, refine qi to reach the clear heavens, and let virtue flow through the nine fordings, then one will summon the hidden splendor of the numinous radiance, reviving the decayed and aged to endure forever. Blessings and felicity cling to the mysterious enterprise, and primordial auspiciousness disperses among one’s kin. This may be called enjoying the prosperity of life and death, while ancestors are reborn as embryonic immortals. Such is the wondrous transformation of the Great Image—how majestic is this numinous scripture!

*The Scripture of Natural Esoterica* says:
Close the eyes and visualize the Perfect Real,
Refine contemplation to summon the Ten Elders.
Ascend as an immortal, forever without action,
The divine countenance eternally wondrous and fair.
Thirst is quenched with the nectar of the Jade Pool,
Hunger is sated with the Golden Radiance Herb.

Thus, Master Chen, in cultivating the Dao and meeting the Perfected, necessarily took refined contemplation as the foundation and entering visualization through stillness as the priority.

**The Rites of Prolonged Fasting**
*The Great Mystery Scripture, Eighth Scroll: Commentary on the Transmission of Precepts by Laozi* states: In fasting and offerings, abundance or frugality should be arranged according to the occasion. The great method values clarity and emptiness, with simplicity as the highest principle.

*The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection, Fourth Scroll* says: Formerly, Ji Wei observed prolonged fasting for three years, exhausting his sincerity in solitary contemplation. Thereby, he was able to ingest the essence of the sun and moon’s radiance, and his body became suffused with divine light.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Fifth Scroll* states: On days of *jiayin* and *gengshen*, when corpse-demons vie to disrupt the spirit and stir defilement, one must not share a mat with a spouse or engage in conversation. Instead, one should enter seclusion, fast, face east, and bow with the heart, visualizing the spirit and contemplating qi, awaiting the response of the divine luminaries. This accords with one’s intent in making offerings. By doing so, Jade Maidens will descend to attend.

For those who study the Dao, one must first restrain the hun and po souls, eliminate corpse-demons, and on the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, *gengshen* and *jiayin* days, enter seclusion, fast, bathe to cleanse the dust, and sit upright on a mat. It is best not to sleep. With a cinnabar brush, mark the left eye beneath the cheekbone, and with a realgar brush, mark the right side beneath the nose, allowing a small portion to enter the valley within. After marking, first knock the teeth together three times and silently pray:
*"The flying wrappings of the Upper Radiance scatter cinnabar and realgar as mist. Qi seizes the numinous and evil, corpse-defilement sinks and vanishes. Harmonize the hun and refine the po, unite the form with the Great Spirit. Grant me undying life, eternal preservation for ten thousand years, keen hearing and penetrating vision, perpetual advantage and smooth passage."*
After the prayer, knock the teeth together three more times, swallow saliva three times, and press the second finger of the right hand beneath the left eye seven times. Press firmly without lifting the hand. Then press these two points thoroughly—these are the gateways through which the seven po and wandering corpses travel, the bridges through which thieving spirits and evil qi pass. Thus, receiving the essence of cinnabar and realgar blocks the path of corpse-demons, while the two radiant forces fumigate and disperse chaotic qi. This is the supreme method of the Great Ultimate. By practicing it regularly, the hun and po become harmonious and gentle, corpse-defilement scatters and vanishes, and one attains the long life of the divine immortals, with penetrating vision and unimpeded qi. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts will entirely cease.

*The Scripture of Immeasurable [Virtue]* says: Observing prolonged fasting in the first month and reciting this scripture severs the earthly bonds of past lives’ wandering souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace. Observing prolonged fasting in the seventh month and reciting this scripture grants one the attainment of divine immortality, with one’s name inscribed in the Yellow Register of the heavens, erasing death and ascending to life. On the eight nodal days, reciting this scripture makes one a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, reciting this scripture purifies the hun-soul and spirit, preserves the myriad qi forever, spares one from suffering and distress, and grants a luminous body. The Three Realms will attend and guard, the Five Thearchs will receive, the myriad spirits will pay homage, one’s name will be recorded in the heavens, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one will ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Eighth Scroll* states: Xin Xuanzi, styled Yanqi, was a native of Dinggu in Longxi and lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han. From youth, he was fond of the Dao, followed the precepts and commandments, cultivated苦行 with utmost sincerity, ate vegetables at midday, refined his form and preserved his essence, avoiding external distractions. Sometimes he wandered in the mountains and forests, shunning worldly dust. His aspiration was to rely on Master Jin of Mount Goushen and accompany Lingyang in treading the mysterious. Thus, he changed his name to Xuanzi and styled himself Yanqi. This is also recorded in *The Fourth Scroll of the Transmission of Daoist Learning*.

*The Scripture of the Lesser Kalpa* says: In burning incense and paying homage, one should eat once at midday.

*The Fourth Scroll of the Transmission of Daoist Learning* also states: Fan Chai was a native of Langzhong in Baxi. Fair-skinned with beautiful hair, fine eyebrows, and bright eyes, his demeanor was refined and elegant. He spoke only after being seen, never discussed omens or portents, was tranquil and desireless, and remained silent all day. He knotted tattered cloth into a net, wore straw to barely cover his body, went barefoot in winter and summer without his feet cracking, and never slept through the four seasons. In the fourteenth year of the Taiyuan era, he arrived in Jingzhou and resided at the tail of Fucheng Isle in Zhijiang County of Nan Commandery. There was a hut that did not shield against wind or frost. He used mulberry branches for a bed, with eastern straw stuffed between them. He had one empty bamboo container, one clay jar, and used a broken jar as a pillow to lean on while sleeping. Sometimes, he would carry the jar to beg for food for ten days. He abstained from polished rice, fine grains, rich wines, and flavorful fruits, consuming only coarse millet rice, vegetable broth, and about one *sheng* of food, which sufficed for over ten days.

Volume Ten states: Dongxiang Chaozong, styled Yilun, was a native of Qianzou in Gaomi. From childhood, he departed from worldly ways, avoiding marriage and officialdom. His conduct was earnest and sincere, enduring what others could not. He ate only at midday, his meal consisting solely of hemp and wheat. His disciples and family all admired his vegetarian fare, and in the refined hut where he dwelled, no fish or meat entered. Residing at the Hall of Rare Mystery, when Emperor Wu of Liang promoted the three teachings in unison, he decreed that all meals be vegetarian. Though edicts were issued, few could adhere to them. Yilun, however, observed the rule faithfully, so that all within the hall followed a vegetarian diet. If any privately violated the precept, they were immediately expelled. Even the kitchen offerings were bloodless, and far and near, people marveled at his purity and simplicity.

It further states: Fang Qianzhi, styled Daochong, was a native of Baixian in Zhaojun of Jizhou. He devoted himself to aiding others while neglecting his own body, observing the six periods of the day in fasting. During each of these six periods, he performed repentance rites for the ten directions. Few in the world could follow his example, so he often practiced alone. As his life neared its end, he suspended his fast for seven days before passing.

It further states: Zhang Min, styled Gaoming, was a native of Xuancheng. He dismissed his wife and children, left home to receive the Dao, and maintained a vegetarian diet in perpetual fasting. He regarded his seven-foot body as illusory, sparing no effort to cherish it. Secluding himself in the tranquility of Mount Wu, he cut off all desires for over twenty days. Fierce men and wild beasts gathered near his dwelling, and as his qi and life waned, his kin and friends urgently entreated him to eat. He reluctantly consented, and soon recovered. In the first year of the Dajian era of Chen, he again abstained from food and drink, saying, "I shall preserve this body, but it is not meant for long endurance. It benefits no one. Why strive for prolonged existence? To cultivate the Dao and establish conduct, must one remain here?" When others sought to persuade him further, he refused to listen.

Volume Eighteen states: Shen Faxi, styled Shizhen, was a native of Wukang in Wuxing and dwelled on Mount Zuo’e. Great propagators of the Dao would gather Daoists and laypeople on the fifteenth day of the first month to establish a communal fast and circumambulate the mountain with lanterns.

The *Precepts of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern in Ninety-Two Articles* states: In practicing the Way of Feminine Unity, one may eat lightly at dawn but should not become full. At midday, one may eat a full meal, and after that, only sweet fruits and nuts are permitted.

The *Essentials of Ritual and Discipline for the Numinous Treasure Fast* states: Daoists observe perpetual fasting. After midday, only clear water may be drunk, and one may abstain from food entirely. At dawn, one drinks congee; at midday, one eats vegetables.

The *Baopuzi* states: Hong believed that those who observe extended fasts are either nobles or Daoists whose bodies are inherently weak and unable to endure the six periods of daily rites. He suggested burning incense and performing prostrations thrice by day, omitting the night. If one wishes to fast for a day and night, one may practice the six periods of the Dao. If one wishes to recite scriptures and lecture for a day, one may do so in three periods, with two periods at night for reviewing or reciting scriptures.

The *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Perfection Precepts* states: To delight in life, love the Dao, and cultivate its arts; to maintain a vegetarian diet in perpetual fasting until attaining the Dao—this is the foremost practice. Next are fasts of a thousand days, a hundred days, or a month; moderating and simplifying one’s diet; practicing qi refinement and taking medicinal herbs; and consuming sweet foods as one is able, while discreetly engaging in other matters. Urgent public or private affairs may temporarily interrupt these practices, but once resolved, one should resume without slackening body or mind. Thus may one become a perfected immortal. Those who practice in name only, with negligence and indolence, will face increased trials.

The precepts further state: In a year, the six months of the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh lunar months are for fasting. Within a month, the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days—these ten days are called the Ten Straight Fasts. On these days, celestial spirits descend, and those who cultivate diligently will gain blessings.

The *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Perfection Precepts* states: Perpetual fasting with the six periods may be practiced according to one’s capacity. For major rituals, constant recitation of scriptures, and lectures on auspicious days, communal fasts may be held in three periods to deliver the deceased, rescue the critically ill, absolve sins, and dispel misfortune—all may be practiced in six periods. For scripture recitation and lectures in three periods, two periods at night may be used for review or recitation.

It further states: Those who serve as teachers of the Dao and lead others in cultivation must have a fixed abode and proper attire, their movements and actions worthy of observation, their conduct exemplary. Thus do sages embrace the One as a model for the world, guiding transformation and guarding unity so that all under heaven return to the same source. Returning to purity and emptiness, guarding stillness with sincerity—though one may not yet be free from dependence, one should constantly learn to reduce selfishness, gradually relinquishing worldly affairs, and cultivate the Three Practices. In cultivating the Three Practices, fasting is fundamental. Fasting means alignment, purity, and stillness. It is not necessary to practice the six periods of the Dao, recite scriptures in three periods, or maintain nocturnal contemplation of spirits, repentance, and invocation of the divine. To lose even one of these is to forfeit the others. He who attains one must first master the three: he who masters the body sits upright and undisturbed; he who masters speech silently comprehends the profound; he who masters the mind unites spirit with the Dao. Such a one becomes a master and attains sagehood and immortality. Those who have not fully achieved this should master the body by performing morning rites and abstaining from killing, theft, and lust; master speech by reciting scriptures and refraining from falsehood, frivolous speech, divisive words, and abusive language; and master the mind by contemplating the spirit, relinquishing greed, anger, and delusion. Once the ten evils are cast aside, the ten virtues naturally arise, and one unites with the Dao in truth. Those who cannot do this should not presume to be teachers, nor forcibly establish governance for the sake of profit.

The *Lower Scroll of the Red Writ and Jade Instructions* states: In the Supreme Mystery Palace of the Northern Emperor, on Gengshen days, the Three Corpses and the spirits of the hun-souls report human transgressions to the Celestial Lord. On such days, if one observes fasting and upholds the precepts, contemplating the spirit day and night, the Three Corpses cannot ascend to heaven and accuse one of sins. The earthly officials report one’s good deeds, presenting them to the Celestial Lord. The Great Unity rejoices and records one’s name on the left contract, ensuring one’s place among the eternal people.

The Most High Supreme Palace’s Perfected and Divine Honored One regularly dispatches the Great Unity’s Central Terrace Envoy on Jiazi days to traverse all heavens and earths, inspecting the gods and spirits, dispersing miscellaneous vulgar ghosts and essences. If on such days one observes fasting and burns incense, the Central Terrace Envoy records all good deeds and memorializes them to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Emperor. The Supreme Emperor then removes one from the oversight of the celestial and terrestrial ghost-spirit overseers, inscribes one’s name in the Jade Register, and ensures one’s place as a Perfected Person forever.

The *Dharma Wheel Sutra* states: One maintains long fasts in secluded mounds, unwavering through day and night, partaking only of cypress and pine, drinking from limpid pools. One rests in shadowy caves, journeys alone, herds with deer, shelters the body in forests, sits among wild beasts, listens to the mournful cries of birds. Wind and clouds grow desolate, all things sink into eternal decay. Ice seals the ravines, pristine snow blankets the courtyard. The cold pierces the flesh, yet the will remains resolute. One endures hardship in the mountains, facing every trial without weariness, never seeking rest, ceaselessly seeking the Dao, until at last the imperial heart is moved.

The *Second Scroll of the Transmission of Daoist Learning* records: Celestial Master Zhang abandoned his home to study the Dao, carrying scriptures as he traveled. He entered the stone chamber of Mount Songgao, secluding himself for nine years of fasting. He wandered the Five Peaks, his concentrated devotion accumulating until the Perfected descended and the Dao was achieved. Thus he was called the Celestial Master.

The long fast is greatly emphasized in the various scriptures, but this is not elaborated here. Here ends the fifth scroll of the *Three Caverns’ Pearl Bag*.

**Sixth Scroll of the Three Caverns’ Pearl Bag**
*Compiled by the Tang Dynasty’s Master of the Vast Sea of Dao, Wang Xuanhe*

**On the Rites of Fasting Assemblies**

The *Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Canon: Commentary on the Transmission of Laozi’s Scriptures and Precepts* states: When transmitting the Dao and virtue in a fasting assembly, the ritual limit is thirty-eight persons; no fewer than six may be reduced. Of these six, one serves as the officiating master, and five as guarantors. The guarantors (*bao*) embody six meanings: treasure (*bao*), burden (*he*), illumination (*ming*), witness (*zheng*), deliverance (*du*), and completion (*cheng*). They are as precious as treasure, bearing the task of instruction; they illuminate sincere devotion, attest to virtuous practice, deliver through trials, and perfect the attainment of the utmost truth.

The fasting rites last nine, seven, five, or three days—no fewer than one. To reduce by even a single day renders it a gathering, not a fast. Distributing wealth to feed the worthy is called a gathering. Written petitions are submitted to invite overseers of the assembly. Thus, the *Laws of the Three Assemblies of the Mystic Capital* states: On the eighth day of the fourth month, celestial disciples assemble, all partaking in expiatory meals. The commentary explains: This releases celestial disciples from the wind-destroyed minor atonements for the sins of mortals.

Among the thirty-eight participants:
1. **Three Masters**: One principal master and two assisting masters—these are the Dharma Masters.
2. **Five Guarantors**: Five persons—these are the Chief Lecturers.
3. **Six Illuminators**: Six persons—these are the Fasting Overseers.
4. **Seven Witnesses**: Seven persons—these are the Scripture Attendants.
5. **Eight Deliverers**: Eight persons—these are the Incense Attendants.
6. **Nine Completers**: Nine persons—these are the Lamp Attendants.

If the full thirty-eight cannot be assembled, the number may vary according to circumstances. All must be disciples of divine attainment, persons of refined talent, capable of serving as guarantors and witnesses. Together, they receive the ritual texts and undertake the fast before the precepts are conferred.

The *Central Scroll of the Three Primordials Canon* states: On the fifteenth day of the first month (Celestial Official), the fifteenth day of the seventh month (Earthly Official), and the fifteenth day of the tenth month (Water Official), these three officials ascend to assemble at Jade Capital Mountain to review the ledgers of life and death, sin and fortune. On these days, fasting assemblies must be held.

**On the Relinquishment of Precepts**

The *Lower Scroll of the Perfected Regulations* states: If one who has received Daoist scriptures, precepts, or registers later finds cause to relinquish them, this is permitted, but one must not abandon them in betrayal. To depart without notice makes return difficult. If one relinquishes and later seeks to return, the path back to the supreme Dao remains open. Those who must depart should sincerely inform their master, who will offer parables and admonitions, establishing proper measures. If the measures are not established and the admonitions go unheeded, they shall burn incense, invoke the Three Treasures, and perform the Three Bows. With heart and mouth, they shall declare: “The scriptures, precepts, and regulations I have received are void with my person; the Three Realms, Six Destinies, and the Great Dao are all void; all dharmas are void, all is void.” After reciting this thrice and performing the Three Bows, they may depart, free to follow their wishes. However, they must never slander the true Dharma or reveal secret teachings. Violators shall forever fall into hell, with no hope of rebirth in goodness. Should one later regret and seek to re-receive the precepts, they must first establish merit, offering service and wealth, before regaining them according to the proper rites.

The *Lower Scroll of the Perfected Regulations* further states: If one’s precepts or registers are suddenly lost, half the penalty shall be remitted, and they need not re-receive them.

The *Lower Scroll of the Orthodox Unity Dharma Texts* states: For lost registers, the penalty is five bundles of firewood, three *liang* of cinnabar, and feeding three worthy persons. For the loss of one general register, the penalty is half a bundle of firewood, four *liang* of cinnabar, and feeding five worthy persons. For ten lost, one bundle of firewood, five *liang* of cinnabar, and feeding ten worthy persons. For seventy-five lost, ten bundles of firewood, seven *liang* of cinnabar, and feeding fifty worthy persons. For one hundred fifty lost, thirty bundles of firewood, nine *liang* of cinnabar, and feeding one hundred worthy persons. Once the penalty is fulfilled, the registers may be re-received.

It also states: If the loss is unintentional—whether at home or elsewhere, due to public or private coercion, fire, flood, theft, or banditry—one must truthfully report the time and place of the loss. If the lost register cannot be found, one shall atone by offering firewood and kitchen provisions to redeem the sin, then re-receive the registers, no longer bound by the original terms.

**On the Pure Precepts**

The *Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery Canon: Commentary on the Transmission of Laozi’s Scriptures and Precepts* states: After receiving precepts or completing scripture study, one must fast on the last day of the lunar month and the fifteenth day. During the fast, one observes the Pure Precepts and the Gentle Precepts, reciting them a hundred or a thousand times through the night, without limit beyond the required number. Those capable of this may not reduce it below nine recitations. On other days of fasting or quietude, one may recite while walking, coming, or going, without waiting for the fast. Consult masters and fellow practitioners, reflecting and acting accordingly. One need not recite aloud; heart and mouth must align. In crowds, do not speak the words aloud; ensure they reside in the heart, and the perfected sages above will respond.

The *Lower Scroll of the Orthodox Unity Dharma Texts* states: All Daoist disciples shall first receive the protective talismans and the Three Precepts, then progress to the Five Precepts and Eight Precepts, before receiving registers. If one has not received precepts before receiving registers, they shall receive them afterward in proper sequence. Study and recitation must be fluent, with constant reflection and practice. Forgetfulness or error constitutes a violation. Before receiving registers, no spirits may be summoned; afterward, spirits respond to one’s every movement. Those who fail to uphold the precepts will find spirits unresponsive; transgressors will be forsaken by their divine attendants, who return to the celestial bureaus. The reviewing officials shall then impose calamities, illnesses, public and private disasters, misfortune, and failure in all endeavors. To achieve success, establish virtue, leave darkness for light, dispel evil with goodness, and replace misfortune with fortune—all depends on upholding the precepts. The spirits shall then protect them.

The precepts have distinct texts that must be studied and practiced with precision. Should one fail to comprehend, forget, or misinterpret them—or transgress due to coercion by superiors, fear of death, or deliberate violation—all such acts constitute offenses, collectively termed "breaking the precepts." One must then repent, confess, and reform. Those who violate the precepts bear false witness, betray the Dao to follow heterodoxy, and mingle with Buddhist and secular affairs. Such lack of devotion, divided loyalty, and wavering faith obstruct progress. If, after three admonitions from a master, one still fails to reform, it is deemed obstinacy; persistence in error is rebellion against the Dao. Defiance of the master’s authority warrants the revocation of one’s registers. Those who turn to Buddhism or secular pursuits, or abandon their master’s compassion, may seek redemption without reproach if they reform. Those who provoke others, forsake fundamentals for trivialities, or nominally follow the Dao while violating its true statutes shall find no refuge among the celestial bureaus. Only through prolonged repentance, renewed merit, and supplication may one regain favor and ascend through virtue. There is also *The Rites of Pure Precepts, Registers, and Offerings*, a separate volume for practice.

**On Merit, Prohibitions, and Taboos**
*The Green Statutes of the Central Palace of the Great Mysterious Capital* states: Those who cultivate the Supreme Clarity methods must not turn northward or face their natal direction, lest they offend the Jade Dawn and profane their original true nature. Five such violations bar one from immortality; ten incur punishment by the Left Bureau, leading to death and descent into the Three Paths of Hell, from which one may not reenter the human realm for ten thousand kalpas.

It further states: Disciples who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and the Four Luminances, bearing the sacred writs and moving under the Three Radiances, must not sleep with their heads uncovered, nor appear without headwear or clothing, lest they insult their body-spirits and disgrace the true writs, causing the divine spirits to depart and leaving only an empty corpse. Three such violations bar one from immortality; five lead to death in hell, with no human rebirth for ten thousand kalpas.

It also states: Disciples who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and the Four Poles’ Luminances must not recklessly enter defiled or mournful places, weep sorrowful tears, or offer condolences at funerals. Five such violations sever merit and obstruct immortality; ten lead to death in hell, with no human rebirth for ten thousand kalpas.

*The Yellow Plain Scripture of the Forty-Four Directions* states: Daoists practicing visualization of the supreme methods or cultivating the Great One must avoid seeing corpses or blood-impurities. They should dissolve a grain of cinnabar in water, then wash their eyes, rinse their mouth, and cleanse their hands and feet, reciting softly:
*"The Three Radiant Ways of the Upper Dao,
The Great One guards my form.
The Lord of Destiny, the Five Spirits of Yellow Peace,
Dispel blood-corpses, dissolve inauspicious impurities.
The Seven Axillae’ entanglements disperse,
The Five Viscera bloom anew.
Grant me transcendence,
Long to enjoy prosperity and integrity."*

Daoists receiving the methods of discipleship must not speak of death. Mentioning death disturbs the life-force, causing it to abandon its dwelling, allowing death-qi to enter. The soul departs, and malign qi lingers in the orifices, foreshadowing illness and death.

*The Scripture of the True One’s Regulations* states: Those who establish merit must not violate prohibitions or taboos. They should harmonize with their body-spirits, avoiding mutual harm. Such conflict invites disaster and misfortune. To dispel calamities, one must not act on their natal day or annual fate-day, as these harm the body.

On one’s natal day, one may circulate the Great Cycle of Heaven to refine qi and nurture the body, but must not act recklessly. On one’s annual fate-day, one may cultivate generative qi, nourish the spirit, and foster essence, but must not act recklessly. On the day of absolute fate, one must not act at all, lest it invite disaster and annihilation. On the day of Jupiter, one must not act, lest it invite official punishment and imprisonment. On the Six Harm days, one must not act, lest it invite illness, decline, and misfortune. On the last day of the lunar month, one must not act, lest it invite disaster, withering the body and dissipating qi. On the Year-Breaking day, one must not act, lest it invite disaster and familial misfortune.

The days of *wù-chén* and *wù-xū* are forbidden. *Xū* is the Celestial Gate, *chén* the Earthly Portal; *xū* is guarded by the Dog, *chén* by the Dragon. *Xū* is the Central King Spirit. On these days, the Venerable Elder visits the Most High Lord Lao to review and record the names of all men and women due for birth in the Jade Register. The Nine Elders visit the Nine Venerable Lords to review and record those due for death in the Death Register. The Virtue Elder visits the Lord of Virtue to record the merits of all men and women in the Left Contract. The Heavenly Emperor’s Elder visits the Heavenly Emperor to inscribe the transgressions of all men and women in the Right Contract. The Immortal Capital’s Elder visits the Lord of the Immortal Capital to record those destined for immortality in the Immortal Register. The Celestial Master returns to the Celestial Bureau to review the ledgers, distinguishing good from evil. On these days, the Celestial Gate is closed, the Earthly Portal sealed; dragons roam the Five Peaks, and dogs traverse the river bridges. The Central Yellow Dog Spirit guards the Celestial Gate, the Central Yellow Elder guards the Earthly Portal, and all external affairs are suspended. One must not burn incense, perform Daoist rites, or submit memorials.

Those who recklessly violate these days shall have their souls seized by the Central Yellow Great Spirit and delivered to the Prison of Inquiry for interrogation. For sixty days, no memorials may be submitted, and after sixty days of punishment, the souls shall be returned to their bodies, bringing misfortune, decline, loss, illness, and slander. If on *wù-xū* day one falls ill or faces official trouble, one should sit upright, reflect on transgressions, and repent sincerely. The deities shall perceive one’s sincerity and suspend punishment. If one submits a petition the following day, a decree of pardon shall be issued.

Moreover, it is said: Those who have received the Great One’s method and bear it within shall, upon encountering the mourning of parents, observe three months before the full term of mourning is complete; for *da gong* mourning, one month must pass. Only then may they perform Daoist rites and submit petitions or supplications.

Those who have received the Heavenly Perfected Three Ones or the Vermilion Realm of the True One’s method and bear it within shall, upon encountering the mourning of parents, observe one hundred days; for *qi* mourning, thirty days; for *da gong* mourning, one month. Before the monthly limit is fulfilled, they may not perform Daoist rites or submit petitions or supplications.

Those who bear the Yellow Writs and Contracts within shall, upon encountering the mourning of parents, observe one year; for *qi* mourning, one hundred days; for *da gong* mourning, forty days; for *xiao gong* mourning, one full month; for *si ma* mourning, one month. Before the monthly limit is fulfilled, they may not perform Daoist rites or submit petitions or announcements.

Should one violate these restrictions, they shall fall into the Prison of Level Yin. Within this prison, there is ever muddy mire, slippery and impassable; those under interrogation are forced to walk through the mire, unable to take a single step without falling to the ground. Thus shall they endure for three hundred years. Once the interrogation is complete, they shall be reborn as short, wretched beings, despised by all.

The *True Records, Ninth Scroll* states: On the *gēng-shēn* day of the first month, the *xīn-yǒu* day of the second month, the *gēng-xū* day of the third month, the *guǐ-hài* day of the fourth month, the *rén-zǐ* day of the fifth month, the *guǐ-chǒu* day of the sixth month, the *jiǎ-yín* day of the seventh month, the *yǐ-mǎo* day of the eighth month, the *jiǎ-chén* day of the ninth month, the *dīng-sì* day of the tenth month, the *bǐng-wǔ* day of the eleventh month, and the *dīng-wèi* day of the twelfth month—these are the days of the Supreme Thearch’s execution. On these days, no petitions may be made, and no affairs are auspicious.

The *Immortal Records of the Golden Writs* states: Those who study immortality...

Do not turn to face north when relieving yourself, nor look up at the Three Luminaries. Do not comb your hair, remove your clothes, or spit or curse while facing north—this violates the Destructive Decree of the Celestial Sovereign, which corresponds to the yearly *xià chén*. The "Sovereign" refers to the abode of the Sovereign *qi*. Do not curse the sun, moon, or stars. Do not impose punishments on the Eight Nodal Days. Do not harbor anger on the first day of the lunar month. Do not eat the hearts of a hundred herbs on the third day of the third month. Do not cut grass or fell trees on the eighth day of the fourth month. Do not draw blood on the fifth day of the fifth month. Do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month. Do not dwell on evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month. Do not purchase footwear or items that touch the feet on the fourth day of the eighth month. Do not move bedding on the ninth day of the ninth month. Do not punish or reprimand others on the fifth day of the tenth month. Do not forgo bathing on the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Do not neglect fasting, burning incense, and reciting the names of immortals on the third day of the twelfth month. All such taboos are great prohibitions for heaven and humanity; the Three Officials record and examine them, deeming their violation a grave offense. Some cause the three *hun* and seven *po* to scatter and contend; others incur the hatred of the Womb Spirit, a time when the Three Officials receive evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, malevolent spirits seize the vermilion gates, and at night, one offends the divine perfected. Afflictions flow and transform, and many prohibitions remain unknown to wondrous arts. If you can uphold and cultivate these precepts, you will become a candidate for immortality; if you violate the heavenly prohibitions, you will suffer harm and ruin.

The *Yellow Smoothness Scripture of Questions to the Supreme* states: Upon receiving the scriptures of Laozi, do not partake in vulgar sacrifices. It further states: Those who have received the Daoist methods should, when coming or going, avoid newly built or newly deceased households, and if they encounter a corpse or coffin on the road, upon returning to their dwelling, they must bathe with fragrant water before burning incense. It also states: Those who have received the methods must not enter the home of a woman in childbirth or see a corpse. If separated by distance or barriers, they may continue their daily rituals without restriction by day counts. If no such separation exists at home, they must wait forty-five days before resuming their rituals.

The *Lower Scroll of the Orthodox Unity Scriptures* states: To waver between the Dao and heterodoxy is to lack devotion; harboring dual intentions is foolish and indecisive, a betrayal of the Dao and a rebellion against one’s master and elders. The law decrees that such a person’s lifespan be shortened.

The *Supreme Yellow Simplicity Scripture of the Forty-Four Methods* states: In all matters of cultivating the Great One and practicing the supreme methods of spirit visualization, be cautious never to see a corpse or blood and filth. Seeing one corpse results in being unable to perform rituals for a year and forfeits a year’s progress. This is the discipline of the Imperial One, which retroactively penalizes past transgressions and blocks future advancement. If one sees three corpses in a year, the penalty is three years of forfeited progress and three years of suspended rituals. If one sees twenty-four corpses, they may never again cultivate the Great One in pursuit of immortality. It further states: For those who cultivate the supreme methods and the Way of the Feminine One and the Great One, the *qi* of the three *hun* and five spirits within the body constantly suffuses their headscarves and garments, while the essence of the seven *po* and nine numina dwells beneath their shoes. Thus, Daoist students must not sleep on shared mats, their hempen robes must not be lent to others, and their shoes must not be soiled by filth or touched by others, lest the three *hun* be startled. It also states: When cultivating the affairs of the Great One and making ritual vows, be cautious never to kowtow. Kowtowing overturns the Nine Heavens, disturbs the perfected, and causes the divine officials to reverse their decrees. The Mud Pill Palace is inverted, the Celestial Thearch wails in the Earthly Bureau, and the Great One weeps in the Central Field. Those who do this repeatedly gain no benefit from their visualization; the Three Perfected abandon their palaces, the Seven Spirits are buried and scattered, and the Dark Abode admits misfortune. This is the greatest taboo for the Five Spirits of the Great One. Therefore, those of true attainment merely visualize the act of kowtowing in their hearts, moving their essence to respond, without physically prostrating to invoke the numinous.

It further states: Those who cultivate the Way of the Great One and the Perfected must not perform ritual bows. Bowing is also taboo for the Five Spirits of the Imperial Lord. If one must make a vow during visualization, they should bow only in their heart, without physical prostration.

The *Upper Clarity Great Cavern Precepts of the Ninety-Two Articles* states: In practicing the Way of the Feminine One, one must not weep in sorrow. Weeping for even a moment causes the Five Spirits to wail in the Upper Bureau, the Great One to weep in the Central Field, the spirits to perish, the essence to vanish, and the numinous perfected to depart the body, leaving an empty corpse—what hope of immortality remains? It also states: One must not see a corpse; doing so results in being unable to perform rituals for a year and forfeits a year’s progress. If one sees three corpses in a year, they may not perform rituals for three years and forfeit three years’ progress. Seeing twenty-four corpses means losing the Dao; the earlier text of the *Supreme Simplicity* is largely in agreement with this. It further states: One must not speak of death or wish death upon oneself in anger. Speaking of death forty times disqualifies one from becoming a Perfected, as it is a sin of abandoning life, and within three years, the body will perish. It also states: One must not wear garments of the five colors. Adorning oneself in fine, ornate clothing causes the true spirits to depart, inner depravity to arise, the heart to run wild, the Three Corpses to flee in secret, the Red Child to take flight, and the Dark Chamber of the Long Separation to shatter the form and dissolve the bones, resulting in bodily death and the obliteration of one’s name. If one wears plain, undyed hempen robes, one may chant the Cavern Scriptures all day—what could one not attain? Riding clouds and driving dragons, one may roam the Great Ultimate.

The *Thirty-Six Precepts of the Numinous Treasure’s Inner Discipline for Immortals* states: Those who practice the dark arts should wear plain clothes and straw sandals; donning ornate garments results in losing the Dao. It also states: One must not speak of vulgar, heterodox, or filthy matters; three violations result in losing the Dao. It further states: One may bow to one’s paternal grandparents and parents if they follow the same Dao, but not otherwise.

Those of the same Dao from uncles and younger brothers downward may not be bowed to either. Violations result in bodily death.

It further states: One may not attend the auspicious gatherings of one’s parents.
It also states: Though parents, brothers, wives, and children share the same bond, and though they possess the merit of shared blood, none may sit on the same bed, eat from the same plate, for their Dao differs. All are considered corpse-defilement. Violations result in losing the Dao.

It further states: Husband and wife may not sleep in the same chamber, for impure thoughts arise in the heart, and the Dao is forever lost.
It also states: Unless bound by the same covenant, none may sleep in the same chamber; unless sharing the same bond, none may sit on the same bed, eat from the same plate, or wear the same clothes.

The *Numinous Treasure’s Regulations on Mourning Attire* states: During the year-long mourning for paternal grandparents, one may not approach the corpse but must observe mourning in a separate chamber. For five days, one may not receive condolences. The same applies to uncles and brothers, with a nine-month mourning period.
It further states: After the mourning rites are complete, one bathes, dons the headscarf and plain robes, and may not wear worldly attire. Violations result in losing the Dao, and the offense is severe, subject to the highest penalty. If one’s parents permit, one may extend mourning for a hundred days, then don the headscarf and coarse hempen robes, observing heart-mourning for three years without further outward grief—this is the *Numinous Treasure’s Audience Regulations*. If one retreats into the hidden mountains, all mourning and weeping are entirely severed.

The *Statutes on Establishing the Body and Practicing the Dao, Fifteenth* states: Those who bear the registers of immortal offices and numinous talismans may not bow or wail indiscriminately.
It further states: Before parents, the sovereign, officials of two thousand *shi*, provincial governors, and the Three Dukes, one must show reverence but may not perform ritual bows.

The *Statutes on Entering Governance, Twentieth* states: One may not enter governance within a month of a funeral; one may not enter governance if weeping exceeds three days; one may not enter governance if defiled by impurity before the new moon; one may not enter governance if three years have not yet passed a hundred days. All these refer to offenses of grief and defilement, for one dares not offend the divine luminaries. On *wu-chen* and *wu-xu* days, one may not enter governance; on days of taboo, one may not enter governance; when summoning officials or soldiers, on *bing-yin*, *ding-mao*, *bing-shen*, *ding-you*, *wu-shen*, and *wu-xu* days, one may not enter governance. Violations of taboos while practicing the Dao and cultivating truth result in the deduction of life-years. *Po* days may be used to dispel disasters, *Jian* days to establish merit, but days of punishment and harm may not be used. The annotation states: One may not use days of self-punishment, killing, or harm. When submitting memorials, one may not use *Jian*, *Po*, or *Bi* days.

The *Statutes on Submitting Memorials, Thirteenth* states: *Yin* punishes *Si*, *Xu* punishes *Wei*, *Zi* punishes *Mao*, *Shen* punishes *Yin*, *Mao* punishes *Zi*, *Si* punishes *Shen*, *Chou* punishes *Xu*, *Wei* punishes *Chou*.

The *Twentieth Statute* further states: One may not hold fasts or offer wine and meat within the *zhi*, for eating and drinking defile the primordial purity, incurring a penalty of forty-five days of plain fasting. The annotation states: Minor defilement lasts three days, major defilement seven days; one may seek absolution accordingly.

According to the *Three Caverns’ Regulations on Establishing Jing Halls, Eleventh*: A layperson’s hall is called *jing*; a master’s hall is called *zhi*. The statutes further cite: The *jing* must be established in the *Celestial Virtue*. *Celestial Virtue* refers to the earth of *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, and *ding*. It must be eighteen feet in length and sixteen feet in width. All who bear immortal talismans and registers must establish a *jing* or *zhi*.

The *Twentieth Statute* further states: One may not violate the taboos of the Three Masters or the four generations of the Three Masters’ ancestors. Violations incur a penalty of seven deductions from one’s life-span. These taboos also apply when entering the *zhi*. The annotation states: The Celestial Master is one’s lineage master; the taboos include the names of the master’s great-grandfather, grandfather, father, and the master himself.

*Precepts of the Eight Prohibitions for Fasting, Presented with Full Titles by Your Servant Lu Xiujing*:

The Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao, the Responsive and Numinous Sage, and all divine luminaries—now there are good men and good women who seek to receive and uphold the Eight Precepts, observing a pure fast for one day and one night, using it to restrain body and mind and extinguish the afflictions of the three karmic actions.

The *Cavern Spirit Scripture, Twelfth* states: Fasting is urgent for alignment, for aligning body and mind. When body and mind are aligned, one remains free from disorder and decay. Decay arises from many causes, but the major ones are eight:
1. One may not kill living beings to sustain oneself;
2. One may not indulge in lust for pleasure;
3. One may not steal from others to provide for oneself;
4. One may not lie to demonstrate ability;
5. One may not become intoxicated to indulge the will;
6. One may not recline on high, broad, and grand beds;
7. One may not compete in adorning oneself with fragrant oils;
8. One may not indulge in song and dance to perform as an entertainer.

If today’s good men and good women can refrain from these eight transgressions, the eight forms of decay will have no means to arise, and the Eight Precepts will naturally be established. If upheld without lapse for a long time, one will prolong life and preserve destiny, attaining divine penetration and unobstructed insight. Therefore, those who fast receive and uphold the Eight Precepts, contemplate the truth, and practice the Dao, will find their path boundless and their manifestations swift, all as expected. Now that the reception is complete, one bows twice, rises twice, and retires while upholding the precepts.

The lower eight ranks are governed by the Most High.

On the seventh day of the first month in the second year of *Han’an* of the Most High, at the hour of noon, the twenty-four treatises—upper eight, middle eight, and lower eight—were aligned with the twenty-four qi and bestowed upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling.

25. **Star Mansion**: The Upper Treatise is Distinct Form; the Lower Treatise is **Ganghu Mountain**.
26. **Spread Star**: The Upper Treatise is Preserving Qi; the Lower Treatise is **Baishi Mountain**.
    This treatise governs those born in the *wu* hour.

28. **Chariot Star**: The Upper Treatise is the Golden Hall; the Lower Treatise is **Jushan Mountain**.
    These two treatises govern those born in the *si* hour.

In the first year of *Jian’an*, on the seventh day of the first month, the Celestial Master revealed the lower four treatises, naming them the Complete Treatises. Together with the previous twenty-eight treatises, they fully correspond to the twenty-eight lunar lodges.

The stellar treatises are established in accordance with Heaven, and through the cycles of kalpas, those who receive the mandate as Celestial Masters each clarify and propagate the teachings to save the world and deliver humanity, until the era of Great Peace. When the Lord of Great Peace emerges, additional offices will be established, and those with talent and virtue will be promoted to the rank of Great Spirits.

Furthermore, the *Illustrated Twenty-Four Treatises of Celestial Master Zhang* states: On the seventh day of the first month in the second year of *Han’an* of the Most High, at the hour of noon, the twenty-four treatises—upper eight, middle eight, and lower eight—were aligned with the twenty-four qi of Heaven and the twenty-eight lunar lodges, and bestowed upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling for propagation and transformation.

Celestial Master Zhang, a native of Feng County in Pei State, was named Daoling, styled Fuhan. His nature was stern and upright; he was learned in the classics and cultivated in conduct, mastering the Dao with skill. In the second year of *Yongping*, the Han Emperor issued an edict appointing him Prefect of Jiangzhou in Ba Commandery.

In the first year of *Yuanhe*, on the tenth day of the third month (a *xinchou* day), an imperial edict appointed him Minister of Works. The Duke was enfeoffed as Marquis of Jixian County, tasked with gathering *zhi* herbs and compiling illustrated classics of immortals to procure for the state elixirs of longevity and transcendence.

In the first year of *Han’an*, on a *dingchou* day, an edict summoned him to respond to the Most High. He then resigned his office and entered the territory of Yizhou. In that same year, within the boundaries of Linqiong County in Shu Commandery, at Red Stone City on Queting Mountain, he settled in tranquil contemplation. On the first day of the fifth month, at midnight, a procession of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended before Red Stone City. Golden carriages and feathered canopies were accompanied by an innumerable host of dragon and tiger spirits, ghostly soldiers, and attendants. Five figures appeared among them:

One declared, “I am the Archivist Beneath the Pillars of Zhou.”
Another said, “I am the Most High Lord Lao, newly manifested.”
A third announced, “I am the Central Yellow Perfected Sovereign, the Most High August Emperor.”
A fourth stated, “I am Zhang Liang, Master of the Han.”
The fifth proclaimed, “I am the maternal grandfather of the Celestial Master, the Han’s aide, Master Ziyuan.”

They affirmed: “Your bones and destiny align with the Dao; you are to inherit the legacy of ancient loyal ministers. Today, we confer upon you the hereditary title of Ghostly Marshal, so that your descendants may lead the state without end.” Thereupon, Lord Lao personally transmitted to Daoling the *Step-by-Step Mandate of the Most High*, instructing him to tread the cosmic warp and weft, govern the Three Heavens, assist the state and sustain destiny, nurture all beings, and regulate the *qi* of spirits. He was established as the State Preceptor. In accordance with its measures, he founded the twenty-four *zhi* and nineteen *jinglu* retreats, and was entrusted with the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Awesome Might, to punish the false and perverse. He was allied with the myriad spirits under heaven through divided talismans, all adhering to the Orthodox Unity Dao.

On the seventh day of the seventh month in the first year of *Shanghuang*, the Most High Dao Lord Lao established the essential oral instructions of the eight upper *zhi* grades, held in the palm. The Five Dragons of the *Fu Kui* shaped heaven and earth, arrayed mountains and peaks, and Lord Lao established the *zhi* positions to transform the vulgar. The foolish, insatiable in their greed, fail to grasp this true path to immortality—how could it be casually transmitted to the unrefined?

**First: Yangping Zhi**
Located within the boundaries of Fan County in Shu Commandery, one hundred eighty *li* from Chengdu. The route follows the Luo River into the twin peaks of Two-Fork Mountain, a waterway of forty *li*. To the east of the *zhi* stands Dragon Gate, guarded by divine waters, with two cypress trees growing above. To the southwest lies a great spring, its waters flowing eastward. The *zhi* corresponds to the Horn Mansion; its rise is initiated by the noble, and its governance endures. The Heir Master, son of the Celestial Master, was named Heng, styled Lingzhen. Broad in wisdom and lofty in aspiration, he concealed himself to cultivate immortal arts. Emperor Ling of Han summoned him to serve as Gentleman of the Palace, but he declined. On the fifteenth day of the first month in the second year of *Guanghe* (a *jisi* day), he ascended to immortality upon this mountain. A *zhi* stele was erected, with a pair at the gate, named the Heir Master’s *Zhi*.

To the right lies Yangping Zhi Mountain, which contains the Main Registrar’s *Zhi*, the Heir Master’s *Zhi*, and the Lineage Master’s *Zhi*.

**Second: Lutang Mountain Zhi**
Located in the northern countryside of Fan County in Shu Commandery, three hundred *li* from Chengdu. Above stand immortal chambers and terraces, ancient sites of transcendence. In the first year of *Yongshou*, the Most High Lord Lao, together with Celestial Master Zhang, convened at this *zhi* with the Four Guardian Generals of the Great Year, the spirits of river shrines, and a hundred ghosts to carve stone and swear oaths, all adhering to the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Awesome Might. The mountain bears pines and cypresses, and the Five Dragon Immortal Caverns, through which boats may pass. Holding a torch, one may enter the cavern for three days without exhausting its depths. The *zhi* corresponds to the Neck Mansion; its rise is initiated by the archer, and its governance endures for eighty years.

**Third: Heming Divine Mountain, the Most High’s Zhi**
The *zhi* stands upon it, the mountain linked to Qingcheng Tian’guo Mountain, two hundred *li* from Chengdu, within the boundaries of Linqiong County in Shu Commandery. The direct path spans three hundred *li*, unknown to the world. It is the place where Ma Dizhi and He Danyang attained the Dao. Before the *zhi*, three waters converge into a single belt, where divine dragons reside. There are four golden nails, two stone vessels of gold and silver, and three *hu* of silkworms—some say Yin Xi presides over them. The *zhi* corresponds to the Root Mansion; its rise is initiated by the lowly, and its governance endures for sixty years. *The Fifth Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: When Celestial Master Zhang encountered turmoil in the Central Kingdom, he entered Heming Mountain in Shu to study the Dao.

**Fourth: Liyuan Mountain Zhi**
Located within the boundaries of Fan County in Shu Commandery, connected to Lutang Mountain Zhi, eighty *li* apart, two hundred fifty *li* from Chengdu. Above grow fruit pines and divine herbs; consuming them grants ascent to immortality. The Four Dragon Spirits emerge from the Gate of Riding. Fan Li presides over it. The *zhi* corresponds to the Room Mansion; its rise is initiated by the commoner, and its governance endures for twenty years.

**Fifth: Ge Gui Mountain Zhi**
Located within the boundaries of Fan County in Shu Commandery, connected to Liyuan Mountain, two hundred thirty *li* from Chengdu County, forty-eight *li* from the water mouth of Yangping Zhi. Yang Xianxian attained the Dao here. Above stands Pine-Chestnut Mountain, six hundred *zhang* in height.

**Sixth: Gengchu Zhi**
Corresponding to the Heart Mansion, initiated by the Daoist, its governance endures for ninety years.

**Seventh: Gengchu Zhi**
The mountain rises three hundred ninety *zhang* above the plain, located west of Yangquan County in Guanghan Commandery, five *li* from the county seat and two hundred eighty *li* from Chengdu. Immortals constantly come and go here, where one may transcend calamity and cultivate nature. This was once the place where Zhang Li attained the Dao. The mountain has two stone chambers and three dragon heads, with Huai River winding around it. Corresponding to the Tail Mansion, initiated by the ordained Daoist, its governance endures from beginning to end.

Each person established one *Zhi*, called the Successor Master’s *Zhi*. However, the Successor Master’s *Zhi* and the Chief Clerk both belonged to the Celestial Master’s lineage, and thus another *Zhi* was established.

Now, according to the *Statutes on Offices and Governance of the Mysterious Capital, Chapter Nine*: Daiyuan Zhi and Pingdu Zhi are external wandering *Zhi*. From this, it is known that Emei Zhi and the others are also wandering *Zhi*.

**Twenty-Four Qi Grades**
According to the *Statutes on the Opening of the Mysterious Capital*: The twenty-four *qi* serve as celestial emissaries. Each *qi* spans fifteen days; a year has twelve months, with two *qi* per month, totaling twenty-four *qi* in a year—all are natural *qi*.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery* states: The Three Origins are established by three *qi*. The Three Heavens are: the Beginning *Qi* as the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Original *Qi* as the Heaven of Yu the Great’s Remnant, and the Mysterious *Qi* as the Heaven of Great Redness.

The *Upper Gate of Mastery by Song Wenming* states: Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, Greater Yang, and the Central Harmonizing *Qi* combine to form the Five *Qi*. These Five *Qi*, together with the earlier Mysterious, Original, and Beginning *Qi*, complete the number eight, as the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: "Each of the Three Origins has eight, totaling twenty-four *qi*, from which the species and clans of living beings arise."

This *qi* disperses into clouds and mist, coalesces into forms and shadows, emerges as differentiation, and enters as the True One. Its root is called the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning and Great Brahmā, which divides into three to form the Upper Three Heavens.

As the *Hidden Instructions on Ascending Perfection: Exegesis on Times and Days* states: The twenty-four *qi* are: Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, Waking of Insects, Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, Beginning of Summer, Lesser Fullness, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, Lesser Heat, Greater Heat, Beginning of Autumn, Limit of Heat, White Dew, Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost’s Descent, Beginning of Winter, Lesser Snow, Greater Snow, Winter Solstice, Lesser Cold, and Greater Cold—these constitute the twenty-four *qi*.

The *Fifth Declaration of Perfection* states: The Eastern Azure Heaven of Nine *Qi*, the Southern Cinnabar Heaven where Three *Qi* flow in essence, the Western Heaven of Seven *Qi*, and the Northern Mysterious Heaven where Five *Qi* circulate—these also combine into twenty-four *qi*. As for the Center, it is said: The Central Yellow Center governs the *qi*, presiding over the Mysterious and True, unconcerned with *qi* numbers, as it governs the twenty-four *qi* of the four directions.

The *Scripture of the Arrayed Records of the Lords of the Three Heavens of Supreme Purity* states: Where *qi* resides, it follows where the spirit is born. Where the spirit is, *qi* is; where the spirit departs, *qi* departs. *Qi* is the upright *qi* of the twenty-four spirits. When dispersed, it scatters into clouds and mist; when coalesced, it forms shapes and shadows. When emitted, it becomes immortal transformation; when absorbed, it becomes the True One. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it serves as the omen of the body; in motion, it serves as the omen of the spirit.

**Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences of the Twenty-Four Spirits**
From the *Inner Instructions of the Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected of Supreme Purity*, already recorded in the previous *Eighth Category: The Eight Effulgences*—not repeated here.

**Twenty-Four Hells**
According to the *Middle Scroll of the Regulations of the Great Perfected*: Beneath the Wanyuan Heaven lies Mount Fengdu in the north, in the *gui* region. On the mountain are eight hells governing the Upper Three Offices:
1. **Heaven-Monitoring Hell**
2. **Heaven-Pacifying Hell**
3. **Void Hell**
4. **Natural Hell**
5. **Ninefold Pacification Hell**
6. **Pure Edict Hell**

At the center are eight hells governing the Middle Three Offices:
1. **Mysterious Sands Northern Hell**
2. **August Heaven Hell**
3. **Prohibition and Punishment Hell**
4. **Mysterious Sands Hell**
5. **Form Rectification Hell**
6. **Statutes and Ordinances Hell**

4. **Forty-Nine Hells**
5. **Heavenly One Northern Hell**
6. **River Earl Hell**
7. **Accumulated Kalpas Hell**
8. **Female Perfected Hell**

The twenty-four hells each have twelve subordinate officials: golden-headed, iron-faced, colossal celestial enforcers, totaling 2,400 per hell, wielding golden hammers and iron staves to govern the punishment of sinful souls according to the dark statutes.

**Twenty-Four Earthly Responses**
As recorded in *The Scripture of Myriad Chapters*: When the Primordial Beginning unfolded the chart, the earth emitted twenty-four responses, rejoicing the divine perfected.

1. At that time, the primordial heavens were in chaos, devoid of light. The morning cock heralded dawn, the Four Sceneries grew bright and clear, the Dark Heavens unfurled, and the earth expanded, giving rise to the Five Phases.
2. For thirty-six thousand days and nights, the earth below shared the same radiance, illuminating even the darkest nights with boundless brilliance.
3. The Azure Bird bore a missive to inform the Five Thearchs, rectifying the heavens’ divisions and degrees.

7. The startling phoenix sang in unison, their soaring cries resonant and clear.
8. Flocks of birds danced in flight, rejoicing at the heavens’ edge.
9. Dragons leapt and frolicked, stirring the deep abysses and marshes.
10. The Yellow River’s waters flowed smoothly, fish scales interlacing in harmony.

**Twenty-Four Perfected Charts**
As recorded in *The Scripture of the Five Invocations, Upper Scroll*: To seek the Daoist methods, first bathe and cleanse away filth and stench, and one shall obtain the *Eastern Well Chart*.

**Twenty-Five Natured Colors**
As recorded in *The Central Scroll of the Left Mysteries, Ninth Chapter*: The eyes perceive the five colors, the ears hear the five sounds, the nose smells the five fragrances, the tongue tastes the five flavors, and the body senses the five touches.
The *Thirteenth Chapter* states: Fragrances refer to rank, scorched, fishy, rotten, and aromatic; touches refer to hard, soft, cold, hot, and neutral—all are knowable.
The *Thirteenth Chapter* further states: Possessing these five sets of five—twenty-five natured colors—constitutes the small life of the ordinary person.

**Twenty-Seven Gates of the Dharma, Names and Numbers**
Twenty-seven ranks of immortals, perfected, and sages; twenty-seven great men; twenty-seven heavenly beings within the human body; twenty-seven life-*qi* lords.

**The Twenty-Seven Ranks of Immortals, Perfected, and Sages**

As recorded in *The Comprehensive Gate of Song Wenming*: the highest rank is called *sage*, the middle rank *perfected*, and the lowest rank *immortal*. The *sage* rank further divides into three, the *perfected* rank into three, and the *immortal* rank into three, totaling nine ranks. Each of these nine ranks again divides into three, making twenty-seven ranks in all.

*The Profound Meaning of Dao and Virtue by Song Wenming* further cites *The Eight Simplicities Scripture*: the highest *perfected* are attended by two thousand jade boys and jade maidens, the middle *perfected* by one thousand, and the lowest *perfected* by five hundred. *The Ninefold Return to the Primal Simplicities Scripture* likewise distinguishes ranks.

*The Great Cavern Scripture* states: from life one attains the Dao, from the Dao one attains immortality, from immortality one attains *perfected* status, and from *perfected* status one attains *Upper Clarity*. The Yellow and Lao Lords are *upper immortals*, having mastered the Dao of the *upper immortals* but not yet attained the *upper perfected*.

In Buddhism, those who achieve the four fruits are called *worthy sages*; upon attaining Buddhahood and the Dao, they are styled *great immortals*. When the Dao is complete, they ascend from the beginning of flight to the *Great Ultimate*, and upon achieving the *Supreme Realm*, they are called *lofty immortals*.

The heterodox teachings speak of transforming the spirit into a wondrous form, where the hun-soul becomes the spirit of the body, and when unified, it becomes the *true body* and attains the Dao.

*The Thirteenth Chapter of Discourses on the Mysterious Gate*, in its section on *Positions and Karma*, states: beyond the realms, there are three nines—twenty-seven ranks—known as the names of *worthy sages*.

*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected* states: the *Lesser Vehicle* of immortals has nine ranks: (1) *upper immortal*, (2) *lofty immortal*, (3) *great immortal*, (4) *spirit immortal*, (5) *mysterious immortal*, (6) *true immortal*, (7) *heavenly immortal*, (8) *numinous immortal*, and (9) *ultimate immortal*. The *Middle Vehicle* of the *perfected* has nine ranks: (1) *upper perfected*, (2) *lofty perfected*, (3) *great perfected*, (4) *spirit perfected*, (5) *mysterious perfected*, (6) *immortal perfected*, (7) *heavenly perfected*, (8) *numinous perfected*, and (9) *ultimate perfected*. The *Great Vehicle* of *sages* has nine ranks: (1) *upper sage*, (2) *lofty sage*, (3) *great sage*, (4) *spirit sage*, (5) *mysterious sage*, (6) *true sage*, (7) *immortal sage*, (8) *numinous sage*, and (9) *ultimate sage*.

Though the three nines differ, all are free from desire and engage in contemplation. The object of contemplation is not without distinction, hence the differences among *immortals*, *perfected*, and *sages*. The *upper sage*, *lofty sage*, and *great sage* are the highest ranks of *sages*; the *spirit sage*, *mysterious sage*, and *true sage* are the middle ranks; and the *immortal sage*, *numinous sage*, and *ultimate sage* are the lowest ranks. The ranks of *sages* being thus, those of *immortals* and *perfected* may be inferred. These three nines of people, when viewed in relation to the realms within, constitute the *Great Vehicle*.

**The Twenty-Seven Great Men**

As recorded in *The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected*: the twenty-seven great men correspond to the nine ranks each of *sages*, *perfected*, and *immortals*, totaling three nines—twenty-seven. They align with the celestial lodges, where the twenty-eight lunar mansions omit one, as one is hidden.

**The Twenty-Seven Heavens**

These have already been recorded in the sections on the *Three Names and Numbers*, *Three Qi*, and *Three Heavens*.

**The Twenty-Seven Lords of Life-*Qi* Within the Human Body**

As recorded in *The Scripture of Laozi’s Pillow for Opening the Gate*: within the human body are twenty-seven lords of life-*qi*: the hair is the *Azure City Lord*, the head the *Three Terraces Lord*, the eyebrows the *Eight Poles Lord*, the left eye the *Gazing Clarity Lord*, the right eye the *Mysterious Clarity Lord*, the left ear the *Hearing Clarity Lord*, the right ear the *Decisive Clarity Lord*, the nose the *Lord of the Wondrous Gate of the Celestial Circuit*, the mouth the *Jade Gate Lord*, the lips the *Jade Portal Lord*, the teeth the *Twenty-Eight Primordial Officers Lord*, the tongue the *Limitless Lord*, the throat the *Colonel Lord*, the larynx the *Nine Ministers Lord*, the liver the *Crimson Palace Lord*, the lungs the *Floral Canopy Lord*, the gallbladder the *Longevity Lord*, the heart the *Cinnabar Field Lord*, the navel the *Purple-White Lord*, the stomach the *Great Granary Lord*, the spleen the *Yellow Court Lord*, the left kidney the *Mysterious Wondrous Lord*, the right kidney the *Primal Upright Lord*, the large intestine the *Nourishing Mother Lord*, the small intestine the *Dao-Conducting Lord*, the intestines the *Guardian of the Dao Lord*, the *Triple Burner* the *Mysterious Foremost Lord*, the left thigh the *Small Chariot Lord*, the right thigh the *Wandering Lord*, the left foot the *Thunder and Lightning Lord*, and the right foot the *Cloud and Qi Lord*. These twenty-seven lords of life-*qi* should always remain concealed within the body’s armor; they must not be recklessly revealed.

If counted in detail, there are thirty-one lords, but the specifics are unclear.

The Twenty-Eight Methods of the Central Gates, Each with Its Own Categories

The twenty-eight constellations, as recorded in *The Thirty-Two Heavenly Fast Rites of the Three Sovereigns*, are as follows: the northern quadrant comprises Dongbi, Yingshi, Wei, Xu, Xunu, Qianniu, and Nandou; the eastern quadrant comprises Ji, Wei, Xin, Fang, Di, Kang, and Jiao; the southern quadrant comprises Zhen, Yi, Zhang, Xing, Liu, Gui, and Jing; the western quadrant comprises Shen, Zi, Bi, Mao, Wei, Lou, and Kui. Each quadrant contains seven, totaling twenty-eight.

When one observes the fast of the Three Sovereigns, one invokes the twenty-eight constellations to dissolve the celestial nets and terrestrial webs, to alleviate karmic retribution, and to prolong life.

*The Rites of the Five Tombs Offering* states: the seven constellations of the eastern quadrant are Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, and Ji; the seven constellations of the southern quadrant are Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, and Zhen; the seven constellations of the western quadrant are Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, and Shen; the seven constellations of the northern quadrant are Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, and Bi. For households with curses or entanglements spanning forty-six generations, these twenty-eight constellations possess the power to resolve and disperse them.

The Thirty-Two Methods of the Central Gates, with Their Names and Categories

The thirty-two heavens, as recorded in *The Scripture of Limitless Salvation* and *The Inner Sounds of Jade Characters Below*, are as follows:

1. **Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven**, separated from Taiming Yuwan Heaven by ninety-nine myriad and nine thousand *qi*. Modern exegesis states that one *qi* comprises ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety layers.
2. **Taiming Yuwan Heaven**, separated from Hetong Heaven by eighty myriad *qi*.
3. **Qingming Hetong Heaven**, separated from Pingyu Heaven by seventy myriad *qi*.
4. **Xuantai Pingyu Heaven**, separated from Wenju Heaven by sixty myriad *qi*.
5. **Yuanming Wenju Heaven**, separated from Moyi Jue Heaven by fifty myriad *qi*.
6. **Shangming Qiyao Moyi Heaven**, separated from Yueheng Heaven by forty myriad *qi*.

*The Central Scroll of the Supreme Perfection Regulations* states: these are the heavens of the Desire Realm, where yin and yang commingle, beings are born of wombs, and lifespans accumulate to ten thousand years.

*The Profound Meaning* states: those who uphold the ten precepts and purify their verbal karma ascend to the Desire Realm; those who purify their physical karma ascend to the Form Realm; those who purify their mental karma ascend to the Formless Realm; those who enter the nine grades of practice ascend to the Heaven of Seed People. These ranks were previously recorded in the "Three Categories of Names and Numbers" under the section on the three karmas.

*The Inner Sounds* states:
7. **Xuwu Yueheng Heaven**, separated from Mengyi Heaven by thirty myriad *qi*.
8. **Taiji Mengyi Heaven**, separated from Heyang Heaven by twenty myriad *qi*.

These eight heavens belong to the eastern quadrant, governed by the Qi of Beginning Azure.

9. **Chiming Heyang Heaven**, separated from Gonghua Heaven by ninety million *qi*.
10. **Xuanming Gonghua Heaven**, separated from Zongpiao Heaven by eighty million *qi*.

14. **Guanming Duanjing Heaven**, separated from Gongqing Heaven by forty million *qi*.
15. **Xuanming Gongqing Heaven**, separated from Jiyao Heaven by thirty million *qi*.

26. **Yuantong Yuandong Heaven**, separated from Miaocheng Heaven by eighty-eight thousand *qi*.
27. **Hanchong Miaocheng Heaven**, separated from Jinshang Heaven by seventy-seven thousand *qi*.

*The Central Scroll of the Supreme Perfection Regulations* states: these eighteen heavens constitute the Form Realm, akin to the Desire Realm. Though yin and yang possess form, they do not commingle; beings are born through transformation, partake of fragrant essences, and do not excrete waste. Their lifespans accumulate to billions of years, free from premature death or harm.

28. **Xiule Jin Shang Heaven**, separated from Changrong Heaven by sixty-six thousand *qi*.
29. **Wushang Changrong Heaven**, separated from Yuji Heaven by fifty-five thousand *qi*.

30. **Yulong Tengsheng Heaven**, separated from Fandu Heaven by forty-four thousand *qi*.
31. **Longbian Fandu Heaven**, separated from Jiayi Heaven by thirty-three thousand *qi*.
32. **Pingyu Jiayi Heaven**, separated from the *qi* of Brahmā-conduct by twelve thousand *qi*.

The *qi* divisions of these eight heavens belong to the Dark Heaven of the North.

*The Central Scroll of the Supreme Perfection Regulations* states: these constitute the Four Kinds of Human Heavens, where those who study the Dao may become seeds of humanity. The Queen Mother welcomes them. Those who ascend to the upper four heavens are called *Brahmā-conduct*; though perilous, they do not fail. They pacify all kinds of people, do not fall into the Three Wretched Realms, and may roam the Three Clarities.

As the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* truly expounds, this has already been recorded in the previous section on the four kinds of human and heavenly beings, as well as in the section on the names of the Three Realms. If divided by the four directions, each direction has eight heavens, and four times eight makes thirty-two heavens. If divided by the Three Realms, it follows the arrangement below.

Song Wenming’s *Profound Meaning of the Dao and Its Virtue* states that these thirty-two heavens specifically govern the fruits of fortune, differing from the Nine Heavens and the Thirty-Six Heavens. The fruits of fortune arise from karmic actions, and karmic actions originate from the six roots: eye, ear, nose, mouth, body, and mind. If the mouth’s karma can subdue the body and mind, one ascends to the six heavens of the Desire Realm in accordance with merit. The six heavens are from Taihuang Heaven to Shangming Heaven.

Among the six roots, some still engage with sensory objects, some are conditioned by objects but do not engage, and some gradually no longer condition or engage—altogether three kinds. Three times six makes eighteen, thus giving rise to the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm. The eighteen heavens are from Xuwu Yueheng Heaven to Wuji Tanshi Heaven. When the six roots no longer condition or engage at all, one is born in the four heavens of the Formless Realm. The four heavens are from Haoting Heaven to Xiule Heaven. The reason there are only four heavens is that the six roots are all purified, leaving only benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—hence four heavens. Those who have faith belong to the realm of the Dao and are not born in the Three Realms.

Altogether, these twenty-eight heavens constitute the Three Realms. Though subdued, if not severed, residual habits remain, and thoughts are not forgotten; thus, one does not attain eternal existence and still resides in the Three Realms. When lifespan ends, one perishes and follows the path of their actions.

From Changrong Heaven to Jiayi Heaven are four heavens, called the Four Palaces of Donghua, Nanji, Xiling, and Beizhen. They penetrate the realm of the Dao and serve as the heavens of the seeds of the world. Below, they follow the kalpic destruction, combining with the previous twenty-eight heavens to make thirty-two heavens.

*Profound Meaning, Lower Scroll* further queries: the Five Virtues of the Supreme One all reside in one division, yet only faith is said to belong to the Dao and not be born in the Three Realms—is this not contradictory? The answer is: the Five Virtues all belong to the Supreme One. Saying that faith belongs to the Dao and does not condition the Three Realms does not mean the other four virtues do not belong to the Dao. It simply means that through conditioning the Three Realms, one ascends and transcends. Faith does not condition the Three Realms because, as the scripture states: "Its essence is most true, and within it is faith." The hidden commentary says: studying the Dao depends on cinnabar faith; faith is the foundation of practice, leading directly to the Three Clarities. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are the virtues of the Dao. They arise in sequence, no different from the Great Precepts. When all Five Virtues are complete, wisdom alone is singled out for praise. Speaking comprehensively, the Five Virtues are all the Dao.

The *Treasure Mystery Sutra* also states: "The highest virtue is equal to Heaven and returns to unite with the Dao." Speaking separately, faith alone belongs to the Dao, while the other four belong to virtue—no difference. The *Book of Changes* says: "The Way of Heaven is called yin and yang; the Way of Earth is called soft and hard." Yet it also says: "Heaven is yang, Earth is yin; Qian is hard, Kun is soft." The *Jade Explanation* states: "Without the Numinous Treasure, Heaven cannot be born; without the Numinous Treasure, Earth cannot be completed." Yet it also says: "Above, establishing Heaven and Earth is called *ling*; below, stabilizing the Five Peaks is called *bao*." And again: "In Heaven it is called *ling*; on Earth it is called *bao*." Such examples of synthesis and separation, unity and distinction, are many. If one’s mind is sunk in oblivion, it may not seem contradictory.

Song Wenming’s *Miscellaneous Questions on the Numinous Treasure* states: the Three Realms and thirty-two heavens, according to the *Inner Sound of the Numinous Treasure*, are arranged in the four directions. The *Sutra of Resolute Mind and Its Diagram* presents them as three layers. Yet the present commentary explains them as ascending like a ram’s horns—contradicting both. Why? The answer is: this is how both can be reconciled. The ram’s horns follow Zhuangzi’s meaning. The *Ritual of the Grand Ultimate Perfected* by Fuzhai says: Zhuangzi was the Immortal of Nanhua, so his analogy of ram’s horns can be trusted. Like the intestines’ winding path, it spirals upward. The higher it turns, the loftier it becomes—this is layering, and it also encompasses the four directions.

The *Discourse on the Mysterious Gate, Scroll 20* states: the Thirty-Six Heavens are still the wondrous realm of the Three Clarities. Though their positions lie beyond the realms, their transformations are unfathomable. In small measure, they enter the Three Palaces; in great measure, they transcend the Six Directions. All are the divisions of the sagely response, opening and guiding, transforming and receiving. Speaking of this *qi*, it is neither yin nor yang—profoundly transcendent and pure.

Below this, following the *Numinous Treasure Sutra*, the thirty-two heavens are used to illustrate the Three Realms. Thus, the *Sutra of Salvation* says: "The primordial net flows forth through the thirty-two heavens." These thirty-two heavens all reside in the Void, revolving through the ten directions, rising from the northeast on the whirlwind terrace like ram’s horns. Now, according to the *Sutra of the Original Source*, the directional correspondences are as follows:

1. The *qi* of **Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven**, belonging to the northwest, is the *qi* of Brahmā.
2. The *qi* of **Taiming Yuwan Heaven**, belonging to the Eastern Wall constellation.

Third, the *qi* of **Qingming Hetong Heaven**, belonging to the Encampment Mansion.
Fourth, the *qi* of **Xuantai Pingyu Heaven**, belonging to the Rooftop Mansion.
Fifth, the *qi* of **Yuanming Wenju Heaven**, belonging to the Emptiness Mansion.
Sixth, the *qi* of **Shangming Qiyao Heaven**, belonging to the Woman Mansion.
Seventh, the *qi* of **Xuwu Yueheng Heaven**, belonging to the Ox Mansion.
Eighth, the *qi* of **Taiji Mengyi Heaven**, belonging to the Dipper Mansion.

The above eight heavens reside in the eastern direction, corresponding to the Wood number. Their resonant tone is nine, thus collectively termed the "Nine *Qi*"—the azure *qi* associated with the seven northern mansions.

Ninth, the *qi* of **Chiming Heyang Heaven**, belonging to the northeast, the *qi* of Brahmā.
Tenth, **Xuanming Gonghua Heaven**, belonging to the Winnowing Basket Mansion.
Eleventh, **Yaoming Zongpiao Heaven**, belonging to the Tail Mansion.
Twelfth, **Zhuluo Huangjia Heaven**, belonging to the Heart Mansion.
Thirteenth, **Xuming Tangyao Heaven**, belonging to the Chamber Mansion.
Fourteenth, **Guanming Duanjing Heaven**, belonging to the Base Mansion.
Fifteenth, **Xuanming Gongqing Heaven**, belonging to the Neck Mansion.
Sixteenth, **Taihuan Jiyao Heaven**, belonging to the Horn Mansion.

The above eight heavens reside in the southern direction, corresponding to the Fire number. Their resonant tone is three, thus collectively termed the "Three *Qi* of the Cinnabar Heaven"—associated with the seven eastern mansions.

Seventeenth, the *qi* of **Yuanzai Kongsheng Heaven**, belonging to the southeast, the *qi* of Brahmā.
Eighteenth, **Tai’an Huangya Heaven**, belonging to the Axletree Mansion.
Nineteenth, **Xianding Jifeng Heaven**, belonging to the Wings Mansion.
Twentieth, **Shihuang Xiaomang Heaven**, belonging to the Spread Net Mansion.
Twenty-first, **Taihuang Wengchong Futong Heaven**, belonging to the Star Mansion.
Twenty-second, **Wusi Jiangyou Heaven**, belonging to the Willow Mansion.
Twenty-third, **Shangdie Ruanle Heaven**, belonging to the Ghost Mansion.
Twenty-fourth, **Wuji Tanshi Heaven**, belonging to the Well Mansion.

The above eight heavens reside in the western direction, corresponding to the Metal number. Their resonant tone is seven, thus collectively termed the "Seven *Qi* of the White Heaven"—associated with the seven southern mansions.

Twenty-fifth, the *qi* of **Haoting Xiaodu Heaven**, belonging to the southwest, the *qi* of Brahmā.
Twenty-sixth, **Yuantong Yuandong Heaven**, belonging to the Three Stars Mansion.
Twenty-seventh, **Taiwen Hanchong Miaocheng Heaven**, belonging to the Turtle Beak Mansion.
Twenty-eighth, **Taisu Xiule Jin Shangtian**, belonging to the Net Mansion.
Twenty-ninth, **Taixu Wushang Changrong Heaven**, belonging to the Triaster Mansion.
Thirtieth, **Taishi Yulong Tengsheng Heaven**, belonging to the Stomach Mansion.
Thirty-first, **Longbian Fandu Heaven**, belonging to the Bond Mansion.
Thirty-second, **Taiji Pingyu Jiayi Heaven**, belonging to the Straddling Mansion.

The above eight heavens reside in the northern direction, corresponding to the Water number. Their resonant tone is five, thus collectively termed the "Five *Qi* of the Mysterious Heaven." The central direction corresponds to the Earth number, with a resonant tone of one, which unifies the four directions—hence no separate placement is made. Moreover, the Three Clarities are revered as the central axis.

These thirty-two heavens revolve ceaselessly, their *qi* systems governed by the interplay of yang moving within yin and yin moving within yang. The thirty-two heavens ascend in sequence, spiraling upward along the ram’s-horn path, ultimately ascending through the Dao-conduct to enter the Three Clarities.

The *Hidden Commentary on the Treasure Formula* states: "The Mysterious Staircase arises from the Whirlwind Terrace in the northeast—this is the Mysterious Heaven, the origin of ascent, signifying the celestial staircase emerging from the whirlwind." Additionally, the *Inner Tone* and the *Five Refinements of the Corpse* both array the thirty-two positions, distributing them across the four directions. Here, we briefly follow this text as one interpretive path.

**Question:** Why are humans attributed to the heavens but not to the four corner heavens—**Taihuang Huangzeng**, **Chiming Heyang**, **Yuanzai Kongsheng**, and **Haoting Xiaodu**?

**Answer:** Because the corner directions lack stellar mansions.

The *Sacred Records of Lord Lao, Scroll Ten: Deceptive Heresies* states: "This is the Jade Clarity Realm, where the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning resides above the thirty-fifth heaven." It further says: "The *Great Perfection Records of the True Worthies* states: This is the Highest Clarity Realm, where the Grand Supreme Lord of the Dao resides above the thirty-fourth heaven." And: "The Great Clarity Realm, the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, is where Lord Lao resides above the thirty-third heaven." It also says: "The Buddha, a Western foreigner who attained the Dao, presides over the Palace of Extended Truth on the thirtieth heaven—this is the king of Kapilavastu."

The Thirty-Two Emperors—according to the *Sutra of Boundless Salvation*—are as follows:
1. Yuyan Yuming
2. Xu’anatian
3. Yuanyu Qijing
4. Liudun Neixian
5. Chou Falun
6. Tianhuai Yan
7. Zhengding Guang

When the Great Vehicle’s myriad practices reach perfection, fully possessing the seventy-two marks, one severs ties with the human world, transcending to ascend heaven in broad daylight, achieving the supreme and ultimate Dao, the ancestor of all immortals, the honored among all sages. Thus, the *Sutra of Insightful Wisdom and the Great Precepts* states: “Resplendent is the vajra body, surpassing the Supreme Transcendents.” Therefore, it is said: the Dao within the Dao, the immortal among immortals.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes* states: “Atop the head’s crown, the Primordial Ultimate is boundless, universally perceiving the immeasurable, penetratingly illuminating the supreme and most true, profoundly tranquil and mysteriously pervading, the source of great wisdom.” If one does not possess the seventy-two marks, all will perish and be reborn among humans, further cultivating merit and establishing virtue, progressing from the subtle to the manifest, thereby attaining the seventy-two marks, transcending to ascend heaven in broad daylight and achieve the supreme Dao without duality. Thus, it is called the True One, the Primordial Beginning, the Great Dao.

Thus, the *Jade Register of the Three Primes* states: “The body penetrates the purple void, the spirit reflects the golden countenance.” The seventy-two marks brightly illumine the great firmament.

The *Dharma Wheel Sutra* states: “Attaining the vajra body with seventy-two marks, the nape bears perfect clarity, penetratingly reflecting the great void, ascending to the rank of lofty immortal.” It further states: “The thirty-two marks of excellence all shine forth from within the body. The nape bears seven-jeweled light, illuminating the forms of all heavens.”

As for Laozi’s seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, Laozi undergoes nine transformations: In the first transformation, his body is six feet and six inches tall, wearing a fish-hawk crown and eight-fringed phoenix robe; in the second transformation, his body is seven feet and seven inches tall, wearing a layered crown and white robe with red collar and sleeves; in the third transformation, his body is eight feet and eight inches tall, wearing a *tongtian* crown and five-colored robe; in the fourth transformation, his body is nine feet and nine inches tall, wearing a *bixie* crown and cassia-silk robe; in the fifth transformation, his body is ten feet and three inches tall, wearing a dragon-serpent crown and vermilion radiance robe; in the sixth transformation, his body is ten feet and seven inches tall, wearing a *xuwu* crown and black feathered robe...

In the seventh transformation, his body is ten feet tall, wearing an *yuanqi* crown and dragon-serpent robe; in the eighth transformation, his body is eleven feet and five inches tall, wearing a *baibian* crown and natural robe. When Laozi undergoes his ninth transformation, his body possesses seventy-two marks, corresponding to the seventy-two *qi*, and eighty-one excellences.

The seventy-two marks are as follows: His head is round, modeling Heaven; his crown resembles Kunlun. His hair is coiled like morning clouds, his jade-like nape rising gently. His hoary hair is like a crane’s, over seven feet long; his tiger-like whiskers and dragon-like beard are pure and silken. His brows resemble the Northern Dipper, their color like emerald green; between them grows a purple hair, over five inches long. His ears lack outer rims, with three openings within, rising level with his crown, thick and firm. His two eyes are clear as mirrors, their pupils shining with solar essence and purple light; his square pupils are bright and refined, with green veins at their center. His nose has twin pillars, shaped like a cut tube. His mouth is square as the sea, his lips red as cinnabar. His breath carries a purple hue, its fragrance like orchids. His teeth are like contained cowries, firm as silver, thirty-two in number, evenly aligned above and below. His tongue is long and broad, patterned like brocade; jade-like springs overflow within, its taste sweet and fragrant, its sound like gold, its tone like jade. His cheeks resemble transverse ridges, his jaw like a mound; his forehead is radiant as the sun, his temples concealed as the moon. His brow bears straight, rhinoceros-like lines, his dragon-like visage divinely mutable; his golden countenance is yellow-hued, his jade-like bearing lustrous. His forehead has three lines, ascending in alignment; his celestial court is level and full, his face square—a sign of longevity. His abdomen bears white moles, his jaw a jade-like orb. His neck has three folds, white as a crane’s and towering. His arms hang past his knees, his hands bearing ten lines. His fingers have jade-like nails, his body green down. His back bears the *He Kui* star, his chest the recumbent bone. His heart has nine apertures, its exterior patterned like brocade. His navel is an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His feet are square as a carpenter’s square, his soles like paired *Dharma* wheels. His steps tread the Two and Five, his toes bearing Qian and Kun. His blood is white within, his outward appearance aged. His body is twelve feet tall, his entire form exuding fresh fragrance. His gait is like a tiger’s stride, his movement swift as a dragon’s.

These are the seventy-two marks. To his left, he is supported by the Azure Dragon; to his right, the White Tiger. Above his head arises the Vermilion Bird; beneath his feet treads the Dark Warrior. His body is like *vajra*, his countenance like lapis lazuli. A fivefold radiance encircles him, purple *qi* rises above his head, and the true character gleams upon his chest. These nine excellences, combined with the preceding seventy-two marks, form the eighty-one excellences.

The *Golden Book of Immortal Records* and the *Arrayed Chronicles of the Nine Mysteries of the Later Sage* both state: The Azure Lad said, "Those with bone registers are inclined toward immortality. Those inclined toward immortality possess immortal aspirations. Among those with immortal aspirations, some are weary, others steadfast. Weariness stems from insufficient merit in past lives; steadfastness arises when the mysterious register and predestined fate are settled. Generally, when celestial registers manifest in the Mysterious Palace, the *qi* and seasons align with the bodily form; when register characters are revealed in the Supreme Ultimate, the heart and spirit are rectified in the cinnabar chamber. If one is born with a name inscribed in the Golden Tower and Jade Register, their eyes will shine with solar light, their teeth will be green, and their blood white. Such a person is benevolent and delights in immortality, intelligent and outstanding. If one possesses the Golden Book and Jade Register of the Upper Clarity, their back will bear the *He Kui* star and their chest the recumbent bone. Such a person is reverent, humble, and extends virtue even to insects. If one bears the cinnabar script and azure characters of the Supreme Ultimate, their hands will display the characters of 'inverted greatness' and 'accumulated humanity.' Such a person is discreet and devoted to truth, pure and tolerant of others. If one has a name inscribed in the dark and white registers of the *Fangzhu*, their eyes will have four pupils with purple light illuminating their form. Such a person cultivates profound and wondrous practices, cleanses the present, and avoids defilement. If one bears the inner jade weft of the Cloud Chamber, their eyes will be round and observant, their mouth dragon-like, their tongue fine. Such a person is open-hearted and embodies truth, discerning and decisive. If one has a cinnabar character and purple name in the Vermilion Palace, their movements will resemble the phoenix’s dance and the simurgh’s leap, their navel palace radiant. Such a person is attentive to life’s inquiries, their heart open and pure. If one has their name compiled in the Jade Register of the Grand Clarity, their voice will carry the tone of jade and the resonance of gold, their mouth square, their eyes round. Such a person is magnanimous and broadly loving, cherishing others as a mother. If one has a name inscribed on the jade slips of the Grand Simplicity, their abdomen will reveal a white aspiration, their mouth emit purple *qi*. Such a person is compassionate and spiritually attuned, humbly benevolent toward all. If one bears the cinnabar script and purple register of the Southern Culmen, five *qi* will rise from their head, connecting to the layered clouds of the celestial towers. Such a person is harmonious, benevolent, and aids the destitute, relieving hardship and rescuing from peril. If one has their name recorded in the mysterious jade registers of the Dipper, their heart will have nine apertures, their lungs bear brocade-like patterns, their jaw a jade orb, their eyes green veins, and their brow angles two ascending lines. Their facial contours are orderly, their temples exposed, their bright hall level and white. The dry lines serve as the passage to true transcendence, the broad forehead as the dwelling of the numinous. Such a person is compassionate toward the poor and humble, their benevolence extending even to birds and beasts. If one bears the azure-gold and cinnabar script of the Upper Primordial in the Mysterious Palace, their heart will be cinnabar with purple apertures, their bones encircled by yellow blossoms, their breath fragrant, and their teeth filled with jade-like fluid. Such a person delights in gazing at the moon’s flowing rosy clouds and the stars’ luminous scenes from youth, their essence pure, their bones firm, their sincerity deep and secret. If one has a name inscribed in white jade and gold characters on the Cinnabar Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, their liver will be green with purple vessels, their kidneys patterned like layered silk, their dark breast brimming with essence, their form rivaling their spirit in purity. Their body is fragrant and supple, their blood clear, their *qi* lustrous. Such a person is devoted to the distant and mysterious, savoring the numinous essence, benevolent toward inferiors, and rescues those in hardship and suffering."

If the Three Primordials Palace bears jade tablets inscribed in azure script, such a person will have a purple brain and brocade tongue, dark aspirations at the temples, green intestines and vermilion marrow, square feet and rounded brow, hidden reinforcing bones, soft hair with purple sheen, three gates at the orifices, movements slightly restrained, eyes gleaming with flowing light, azure essence congealing into fluid, palms marked with four fungi, and teeth with triple palates. Such a person possesses a numinous heart and benevolent love, their kindness stirring the divine; they delight in subtle reverence and trust, love forests and spring, cherish clear-flowing waters, hold mountains and rivers in their heart, yearn to inscribe their name on the Azure Peak, preserve their *po* and nurture their *hun*, their aspirations soaring toward serene tranquility, and long for the celestial immortals.

All who bear these thirteen superior forms are of the highest destiny, certain to attain the rank of supreme immortality—this may be achieved through study or even without it.

Next is the Dark Mountain upon the nose. The Dark Mountain refers to a black mark upon the nose. There should also be a Dark Mound upon the abdomen, directly opposite the Dark Mountain. The Dark Mound is likewise a black mark. If either is lacking, the immortal’s physiognomy is incomplete. If one’s breath is foul and one’s nature tolerates filth, the signs of the Dark Mountain and Dark Mound are entirely ruined.

Next is the Azure Bone. Those with Azure Bone delight in the fragrance of the five incenses and are drawn to the study of divine and numinous matters.

Next are the crane’s gait and dragon’s stride, a jade pillow upon the nape, hidden dawn behind the ears, azure marks beneath the ribs, a network of veins upon the body, a true heart and tranquil gall, firm ears and expansive *qi*—these are all signs of lesser immortals.

Those born with these signs need not study the Dao—they are destined to become immortals.

It further states: "The Lady of Yangdu was a girl who sold wine in the marketplace. Born with joined brows and long, slender ears, all marveled at her, calling her a celestial being. She wed a man of Ye named Duzi, and together they entered the mountains."

*The Latter Biographies of the Immortals* states: "Master Ning had a hairy body, broad ears, and unbound hair."

The *Laozi’s Scripture on Virtue and the Dao* states: "Thick hair is the root of attaining the Dao; sweat on hands and feet signals abundant essence-*qi*.

Those with names inscribed on the Imperial Chart in green characters and bones of purple that harmonize with the True may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years."

It further states: "The *Purple Writ of the Blue Essentials*—those with marrow of gold and bones of jade, their names inscribed on the Imperial Register, may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years."

*The Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Right Palace of the Great Mystery Capital* states: "Those with jade bones may transmit the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles* from the treasure store of the Upper Clarity."

*The Inner Biography of Perfected Lord Wang of the Clear Void* states: "Perfected Lord Wang, whose name was Bao and style Zideng, consumed dragon-bright pearls and crimson harmonious cloud fungi. His body radiated golden light, his neck bore a halo, the Seven Luminaries scattered blossoms, and flowing radiance illumined his form."

*The Inner Biography of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount* states: "Her essence was lofty and resplendent, her round spirit doubly radiant, her body that of a phoenix and bones of a dragon. Her brain shone with precious luminosity, her five viscera bore purple networks, and her heart had feathered patterns."

*The Scripture of the Eight Luminaries of the Most High* states: "Those who consume the four medicines, purple nectar, five pearls, and crimson life-generating elixir will have their heads emit the light of the Nine Dawns, their faces bear jade splendor, and flying radiance illumine precious luminosity. They will perceive all under heaven, ascend through the void to the Purple Void, enter and exit the Jade Clarity, and repose in the Morning Chamber."

It further states: "The *Secret of the Celestial Net’s Flight* is concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Jade Void. Those with names inscribed on the Imperial Register in gold, jade tablets of the Upper Clarity, and bones harmonizing with the True may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years."

It further states: "The *Orthodox Law of the Three Heavens* is concealed within the Golden Chamber of the Jade Clarity atop the Nine Heavens. Those with names inscribed in gold and jade characters, bodies bearing purple storehouses and jade marrow, may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years."

*The Scripture of the Golden Register’s Simplified Writ* states: "Closing the eyes and visualizing the body as golden, the neck bears a halo like the sun’s image, illuminating the ten directions. Within the body, all is clearly seen, both inner and outer."

*The Scripture of the True Talismans for Dispelling Demons* states: "Those with marrow of gold and bones of jade, whose five viscera generate blossoms and bodies emit wondrous light, whose names are recorded in the Blue Box, may behold the Cavern Scripture."

*The Inner Biography of the Purple Void Primordial Lady* states: "Perfected Lady Jinglin said to Hua Cun: 'Now I observe your essence—lofty and resplendent, your round spirit doubly radiant, your body that of a phoenix and bones of a dragon. Your brain shines with precious luminosity, your five viscera bear purple networks, and your heart has feathered patterns. Thus your form dwells in the morning clouds, and your spirit communes with the numinous streams.'"

When the Dao harmonizes with supreme peace, and the governance of immortals aids in rule, one’s innate response proves fitting for use—such talent is truly magnificent. The role of such a person is surely not in vain.

*The Scripture of the Hidden and Secret Treasures of the Great Ultimate* states: The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said, "For one who bears the auspicious marks of an immortal, the essential quality lies in a compassionate heart. By encountering all things with kindness to nurture these marks, one may attain immortality. If one cannot restrain the nature and tolerate faults, the immortal marks will be ruined."

*The Inner Biography of the Supreme Perfected* states: Yin Xi’s eyes held the essence of the sun, his form was tall and refined, his arms hung past his knees, and his neck bore a radiant halo. His five viscera bore patterns, his face had the seven stars, above mirroring the celestial patterns and below aligning with earthly principles—nothing was lacking. Thus, he was entrusted with refining his essence, transcending birth in the final kalpa, and destined to become the foremost of noble perfected ones.

*Monthly Ranks of the Heavenly Years*
*The Jade Essence True Scripture of the Three-Nine Plain Speech* states: On the auspicious hour of the first year of the Beginning Era, the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, at the northern pivot of the celestial shift, halted their chariots at the Three Origins, aligned with the splendor of the Nine Emperors, and ascended to the High Jade Palace of the Purple Void Heaven.

*The Three-Nine Plain Speech* states: Unveiling *The Jade Essence True Scripture of the Numinous Pass* governs the myriad immortals.

*The Scripture of the Three Origins’ Jade Tallies and Three Origins’ Array* states: In the first year of the Pure Void Era, the Celestial Venerable of the Origin taught *The Scripture of the Three Origins’ Jade Tallies* to the Three Heavenly Jade Lads in the Cloud Chamber of Bright Radiance within the Palace of Grand Empyrean. It further states: In the first year of the Pure Void Era, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the cyclical sign being gengyin and the hour aligning with the celestial stem, the Celestial Venerable of the Origin ascended in fasting to the Upper Clarity Palace. There, he proclaimed the covenant to the boundless—without summit, without color, without shadow, without form, without name, without ancestry, without lineage, without limit, without end—and the naturally limitless Dao of the Nine Mysteries of the Cavern Clarity. He bestowed the *Three Origins’ Jade Tallies* upon the Three Heavenly Jade Lads, commanding them to transmit it to later disciples whose mysterious names would mark them as Perfected of Upper Clarity.

*The Lower Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: In the first year of the Green Dragon Era, when the year-star resided in xinhai, on the first night of the ninth month, this *Great Cavern Scripture of Thirty-Nine Chapters* was received by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity.

*The Scripture of the Nine Empyreans of the Heavenly Return, Recorded by the Seven Saints of the Jade Emperor* states: In the first year of the Central August Era, on the seventh day of the ninth month, the Seven Saints united in numinosity to present *The White Tallies and Azure Registers of the Nine Empyreans of the Heavenly Return*, elucidating its profound principles.

*The Scripture of the Eight Effulgences’ Flight and Ascent* states: The Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Establishing Beginning Era, on the auspicious hour of the celestial stem in the eastern pivot, observed a pure fast. At the Seven-Treasure Jade Terrace of the Grand Void, he swore a golden and azure covenant with heaven to receive the numinous scripture, summon spirits, subdue demons, and reveal the mysterious chapters of the Seven Origins.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: In the third year of the Primal August Era, within the Flying Dawn of the Grand Void’s Upper Empyrean, the Yellow Elder of the Central Yellow, though but seven years old, grasped the essentials of longevity.

*The Inner Instructions of the Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: The Yellow Elder of the Center was born in the sixth year of the Upper August of Pure Numinosity.

*The Scripture of the Seven Stars’ Celestial Shift* states: For those who seek the five supreme wishes of the Lord Emperor’s immortal path, the Lord Emperor regularly observes these five wish-fulfilling assemblies: the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month. Ascend to the Jade Palace within the Highest Jade Hall of the Great Ultimate’s Jeweled Palace, and meditate upon the five wishes in the secluded chamber. Yearn for the mysterious and true to descend from the void, and with jade chapters and golden tones, proclaim them across the Grand Void. Summon the Five Emperors to guard the numinous, and ferry the myriad assemblies into the cinnabar chamber. Thus, through sincere aspiration, the perfected are drawn near, and their response descends.

On these days, one should bathe, purify, and fast, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow in reverence to the four directions, face due east, and sit upright. East is the direction of the dawning radiance. Strike the teeth thirty-six times and recite the wishes as follows:

**First Wish:** May I be born of the primordial qi, my body formed within it, equal to the Three Luminaries, and may I eternally enjoy the root of the boundless.

**Second Wish:** May my body ever dwell within the Jeweled Palace and Jade Chamber above the Grand Void, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and sharing the table of the Mysterious Mother by night. When thirsty, may I sip from the vast well of jade mushrooms and the red tree’s crimson child; when hungry, may I partake of the dragon embryo’s jade fat.

**Third Wish:** May my body generate seventy-two radiant auspices, with extraordinary hair and bones, and may I don feathered robes to ride the void and mount the sky, entering and leaving the imperial palace. May myriad blessings converge, and may my life be boundless.

**Fourth Wish:** May I be born with the unborn and die with the undying, reborn after death to become an emperor-king, ruling the Ten Heavens and governing the host of immortals.

**Fifth Wish:** May all sentient beings—those already born and those yet to be—along with those who preserve the Dao of the Three Luminaries, the ancestors of the Seven Mysteries, ascend to the Southern Palace. May the world’s blessings be without exception, and may the four directions’ five wishes assemble in the Jade Hall.

**Next Wish:** May the Nine Mysteries nurture my body, and may my hun-soul, po-soul, and true spirit eternally dwell within my palace, ascending to commune with heavenly immortals and descending to reach the cavern abyss. May the wishes for heaven, earth, wind, clouds, and spirits unite as one, and may my name be inscribed for eternal life. May purple mists descend from heaven, and may the Five Numinous Ones guard the earth. Riding clouds and mounting the void, may I ascend in a green chariot to the Golden Gate, advancing to the Jade Clarity. May blessings extend to my seven ancestors, who shall be reborn in the womb, and may the five supreme wishes unite for eternal prosperity and purity.

**Middle Wishes (also five):**
May I attain the root of the Dao,
May I harmonize yin and yang,
May I abide in the Grand Void,
May I merge with the Great Nonbeing,
May I unite with the Great Mystery.
Feasting in the Jade Chamber with the Emperor,
May I share karmic ties,
Wandering and gazing upon the Gate of Life,
Unfurling the waves of the Nine Heavens.
May the Primordial Father inscribe my name,
May the Mysterious Mother record my years,
May peaches and elixirs congeal my essence,
And may my cinnabar field be secure.
May my body ascend to the Golden Gate,
My name inscribed in the Jade Chapters,
My seven ancestors liberated,
And blessings and fortune converge.

**Lower Wishes (also five):**
May I attain the Grand Void,
May I attain the Great Existence,
May I attain the Great Above,
May I attain the Great Perfected,
May I attain the divine immortals.

May I traverse the peaks of the Five Marchmounts,
Drifting between the Nine Heavens,
Moving in and out of the Gates of Opening,
Shifting beyond the Portals of Death.
May Heaven and Earth be my father and mother,
May the Three Luminaries guard my myriad spirits,
May I keep the nine springs’ numinous apertures,
And receive the qi of spontaneity.

The eight directions and five wishes resound in harmony.

The *Dragon-Soaring Hidden Instructions on the Foot-Long Silk* states: In the first year of the Shangjing era, on the third day of the third month, at the dawn of the Yuan Shi, the Grand Realized One suddenly received the *Flying Feather Scripture*, which blazed forth in the Jade Void’s courtyard, and also produced the *Scripture of White Feathers and Black Pinions*.

The *Seventy-Four Methods of Shangqing Transformation* states: The Lord of Longevity and Controller of Destiny of the Southern Culmen, whose register is held in the Supreme Purity’s Mysterious Record, bears the surname Wang, personal name Gaisheng, and style Yidu. In the first year of the Taixu era, during the reign of Luo Xi Fan Meng Shang, in the time of Zhu Ming Xie Qian, he was born in the domain of Donglin Guangchang, in the village of Changle.

The *Scripture of the Seven Turns and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent* states: In the first year of the Yuanjing era, the *Precious Scripture of Supreme Purity* was compiled in one fascicle and sealed in the mountains of the Western Regions.

The *Upper Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants* states: On the first day of the first month of the first year of the Shangxu era, during the Heavenly Yuan’s Convergence of Auspices, on the jiazi day coinciding with the celestial stem, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Grand Thearch were moved by the arrival of a blue-black crow, which bore in its beak a purple scripture and presented it to these two lords.

By the first year of the Zhonghuang era, on the first day of the third month, the gengyin day when the Celestial Virtue coincided, within the Frost-Spirit Cinnabar Hall and the Jasper Terrace’s Yellow Chamber, Yuan Shi commanded the Five Immortals to unbind the cloud-brocade wrappings of frost-laden silk and the dense bamboo slips, producing the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Girdle, Golden Pendants, and Grand Empyrean*, which was transmitted to the Highest Jade Dawn and Grand Dao Lord of the Supreme Clarity.

It further states: In the first year of the Shangkai era, on the first day of the ninth month, a blue-black crow bore the Golden Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ secret characters and presented it to the Queen Mother of the West.

The *Hidden Writ of the Primordial Yuan* states: In the first year of the Zhonghuang era, on the first day of the third month, the jiazi day when the Celestial Virtue coincided, the High Minister, the Azure Lad, purified himself in fasting upon the empty mountain.

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: Hong Natai was born in the first year of the Zhuling era, in the bingwu year, in the Dan Tonglong Luo Wei Heavenly Cavern of the Luminous Jade Land of Zhu Huo’s slopes.

The *Upper Scripture of the Golden Chamber’s Life-Prolonging Methods* states: The Supreme Realized Prohibited Lord of the Southern Culmen, Controller of the Registers, in the first year of the Shihuang era, in the renwu year, on the seventh day of the seventh month at noon, in the Seven-Treasure Cavern of the Boundless Longevity Heavenly King’s domain, beneath the Purple Terrace and Jasper Grove of the Phoenix Capital, inquired of the Heavenly Venerable regarding the methods of life-prolonging and age-reversing. By the first year of the Zhonghuang era, these were transmitted to the Supreme Yuan Lord of the Southern Culmen, the Venerable Master of Myriad Beginnings, and the Golden Gate Thearch.

The *Preface to the Sectional Exegesis of the Laozi* states: In the first year of the Wuji Lingdao era, on the jiazi day of the seventh month, Laozi transmitted the *Five Thousand Character Text’s Sectional Exegesis and Diagrams* to the Pass Keeper Yin Xi, who received them for the sake of longevity.

The *Inner Transmission of the Wenshi* states: In the first year of the Shanghuang era, in the dingmao year, on the twelfth day of the first month, the bingwu day, Laozi descended to become the Zhou’s teacher. It further states: In the first year of the Wuji era, in the guichou year, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month at noon, Laozi transmitted the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* in its two fascicles. It also states: In the first year of the Zhou Wuji era, in the guichou year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Laozi crossed the pass.

Now, according to the *Essential Record of the Two Teachings*: The first year of the Shanghuang era was the reign title of the Human Sovereign Lord, predating the Zhou by seventeen reigns, an extremely remote era. It may be that the Zhou dynasty emulated this in its own reign titles, or perhaps it mirrored the celestial era names. This resembles how the Earthly Sovereign Lord named the first year of the Chiwu era, and Sun Quan of Wu also named the first year of the Chiwu era. Similarly, the Yuanhuang Lord named the first year of the Kaihuang era, and the Sui dynasty also emulated the name Kaihuang for its first year.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writ* states: By the first year of the Shanghuang era, the male and female forms of the various heavens had become purely unadorned, but their minds gradually deteriorated, fearing decline and decay. As the orthodox teachings were incomplete, I manifested in every land to perfect their minds. According to this, these are the era names of the various heavens, not those of the Human Sovereign Lord. It appears that the Human Sovereign Lord emulated these in establishing his own era names.

According to the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Engendering*, Shanghuang is an eon name, preceding the Kaihuang eon and following the Chiming eon.

The *Seventy-Four Methods of Shangqing Transformation* states: The Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen was born in the domain of Donglin Guangchang, in the village of Changle. It further states: He established the Spirit Palace in the Dark Bureau, securing the register in the Primordial Chart. In the northern wilds of Yangli, in the golden-clouded state of Yinhui, he intermingled the two qi to refine and transform, harmonizing yin and yang to support one another. Thus, Yuan Shi inscribed his command upon the Southern Culmen, and the Three Perfected wrote their writs in Donghua. The curling incense smoke drifted, and he wandered to gaze upon the purple cliffs of the Empyrean. He extinguished the knots of death in the Primordial Womb and repaired the Supreme Perfected in the Dark Capital.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Highest Jade Void coalesced into the Golden Phase Palace of Jade Clarity, the Jasper Heavenly Prefecture of the Eightfold Luminous Village in the Dingzhen Ward, named the Primordial August Supreme Elder.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Highest Clarity Primordial Void coalesced into the Golden Slip Palace of Jade Clarity, the Grand Clarity Prefecture of the Open Luminous Village in the Tongzhen Ward, named the High Numinous Nine Heavens King.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Highest Mystery Primordial Purple Void coalesced into the Cinnabar Numinous Palace of Jade Clarity, the Open Clarity Prefecture of the Threefold Union Village in the Yuanming Ward, named the Jade Perfected Nine Heavens Elder.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Highest Void Primordial Cavernous Void coalesced into the Jade Performance Palace of Jade Clarity, the Golden Fusion Prefecture of the Upper Opening Village in the Zhengyuan Ward, named the August Elder of the Three Heavens.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Ascendant Yuan Perfected and Highest Luminous Primordial Void coalesced into the Jasper Upper Palace of Jade Clarity, the Cinnabar Luminous Prefecture of the Threefold Simplicity Village in the Yuanzheng Ward.

The Ward is named the Jade Youth of the Upper Three Heavens. The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Highest August Yuan Sixfold Void coalesced into the Jade Inaugural Golden Palace of Jade Clarity, the Heavy Guest Prefecture of the Upper Union Village in the Sixfold Assembly Ward, named the Jade Treasure Elder of the Nine Empyreans.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Mysterious Upper Yuan Jade August coalesced into the Jade Sevenfold Radiance Palace of Jade Clarity, the Phoenix-Born Prefecture of the Upper Void Village in the Transcendent Transformation Ward, named the Purple Radiance Perfected King of the Nine Empyreans.

It further states: The qi of the Supreme Yuan Perfected and Mysterious Void Yuan Upper August coalesced into the Jade Primordial Treasure Palace of Jade Clarity, the Golden Upper Prefecture of the Separation-Union Village in the Luminous Light Ward, named the Highest Void August Lord.

The above are the names of villages and wards from the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Transformations of the Upper Clarity*, of which there are many more; they are not recorded here in full.

The *Scripture of the Seven Revolutions and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent* states: The Purple Dawn journeyed south to the Vermilion Mound, the Great Cinnabar’s Ultimate Scorching Flowing Fire Ward, where the Southern Culmen Supreme Yuan Lord requested the jade tablets of the Great Cinnabar.

It further states: It journeyed north to the Feathered Yin’s Ninefold Mystery Cold Ward, where the Supreme Yin Jade Dawn Ninefold Yuan Perfected Consort came to receive the treasured chapters of flowing essence and flying radiance.

The *Lower Yuan Register of Mount Tortoise* states: The Northern Mystery Highest Void August Lord resides in the Jade Clarity Purple Jade Palace’s Cinnabar Jade Prefecture, Golden Phase Village, Three Augusts Ward, where the revolving perfection descends and reflects into the jade gates of the adept’s two kidneys.

It further states: The Western Florescence Void August Lord resides in the Jade Clarity Sound Primordial Palace’s Eightfold Terrace Prefecture, Fourfold Luminosity Village, Subtle Culmen Ward, where the revolving perfection descends and reflects into the posterior gate of the adept’s lungs.

It further states: The Eastern Luminosity Void August Lord resides in the Jade Clarity Purple Tenuity Palace’s Vermilion Bird Prefecture, Southern Yang Village, Cavernous Life Ward, where the revolving perfection descends and reflects into the ninefold gates of the adept’s liver.

It further states: The Central Abode Void August Lord resides in the Jade Clarity Golden Numinosity Palace’s Phoenix-Call Prefecture, Dark Spirit Village, Union Clarity Ward, where the revolving perfection descends and reflects into the adept’s spleen palace.

The above are the names of various villages from the *Lower Yuan Register Scripture*, of which there are many more; they are not recorded here in full.

The *Precepts of the Host of Perfected, Third Scroll* states: In the Scorching Valley lies the Land of the Upright Tree, sixty thousand li east of the mountains of Kuaiji.

The *Scripture of the Eightfold Might for Summoning Dragons* states: Above it reaches the foundation of the Jade Capital; below it extends to the Abyssal Cavern Ward.

The *Commentary on the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states: The Eastern Florescence is the province of the immortals and perfected. It lies between the First Radiance, where the Jade Guardian of the High Dawn governs. The First Radiance is the land of the sun’s rising.

It further states: The Dark Continent has the ford of Weak Waters, which none but immortals may cross.

The *Transmissions of Daoist Learning, Twentieth Scroll* states: Lady Zhang Yuan, styled Pure Brightness, resided in Cai Slope Village of Qu’e, and at the age of eleven already maintained a perpetual fast.

The *Scripture of the Orthodox Dao of the Three Heavens* states: There was the August Lord of Former Ages, who now appears as Laozi. The one who descended in the first year of the August Lord to serve as the Zhou preceptor was surely the August Lord of the Later Heavens.

This resembles what is said in the *Upper Scroll of the Comprehensive Gate Treatise*: There are the Former Three Yuans, the Middle Three Yuans, and the Later Three Yuans, which serve as analogies for one another.

It resembles what is cited in the *Seventh Scroll of the Mysterious Gate Treatise* from the *Sixth Scroll of the Cavernous Spirit Scripture*: There are the Former Three August Lords, the Next Three August Lords, and the Later Three August Lords, which are analogous.

It resembles how the Liang dynasty’s Xiang Daoist school referred to the Great Clarity Realm, also calling it the first year of the Great Clarity.

The *Chapter on the Differentiation of Lands, First Scroll* and the *Chapter on Responding to the Dao and Descending into Birth* also contain passages on differentiation.

The *Eighth Scroll of the Cavernous Spirit Scripture* states: The Yeni Heaven extends eighty-one myriad li downward, its terrain shaped like a waning moon.

The *Lower Scroll of the Jade Characters of Inner Sound Scripture* states: The Heavenly Venerable, together with the Five Elder Thearchs and the great sages of the ten directions, expounded in the Cypress Mound Abode of the Vermilion Bright World the great Brahmanic esoteric language and the boundless cavernous chapters of the celestial script in eightfold assembly. The Heavenly Venerable issued a command, and the hosts of heaven reverently obeyed. Thereupon, the four assemblies rose as one, made obeisance, and the Heavenly Venerable raised a hand to point upward, then lowered it to point downward—without above or below, without limit or end, without depth or distance, without obscurity or concealment, without great or small, without number or termination. All were universally delivered, equally illumined, and with a flick of the finger, the assembly heard all. At that moment, the four assemblies simultaneously raised their hands, flicked their fingers toward the heavens, and the thirty-two heavens’ sun, moon, and stars all shone at once. The ninefold dark abyss to the bottomless depths was pervaded with light, no darkness remaining. The hidden was universally revealed, the Earth Treasury laid bare, mountains, rivers, streams, and ravines all leveled as one. Winter blossoms bore fruit, withered trees sprouted anew. All rejoiced, and beings received the merit. Fish and dragons leapt, birds and beasts sang joyfully. Divine songs resounded in harmony, no sorrowful cries were heard on the roads. Heaven stilled, earth silenced, the Three Offices lay hidden in tranquility. The registers were closed, the Five Paths ceased to arise, humans and spirits rejoiced in peace, and the sagely Dao flourished in great harmony.

The *Fifth Scroll of the Scripture of the Ten Latitudes of the Five Thousand Words* states: The Perfected One Talara transformed and journeyed to the land of Zhendan in the Middle Kingdom. The land of Zhendan is called Jambudvīpa. The people of Jambudvīpa were wicked, foolish, and stubborn, and many beings did not believe in the true scriptures. He further divided his form to transform thirty-six kingdoms and also transformed the king of the Naiquan Kingdom. The king detained him and entrusted him with governance, and the king followed in every detail the laws of the Three Caverns from the Five Thousand Words.

The *Eighth Scroll of the Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: I circulate the five qi through the eight extremities, sometimes called the Most High, sometimes called the Venerable Lord, sometimes called the Mysterious Ancestor, sometimes called the World’s Teacher.

The *Third Scroll of the Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: Among them are those who appear as national preceptors, those who appear as the patriarchs of the Confucian groves, and those who appear as upholders of ritual and law. In a single day, I traverse the ten directions—one cannot use the form and substance of the foolish and vulgar to limit the sagely ones.

The *Scripture of the Purple Azure Golden Root* states: In life, his surname was Yao and his given name Boyuan. He nurtured his heart in the realm of bright rosy clouds, roamed the ruins of the Jade Kingdom, wielded the tally of the Primordial August, and cast his shadow upon the mounds of the nine domains.

It further states: The Primordial August Jade Emperor ascends to the capital of the Nine Elder Immortals’ Metropolis, the chambers of the Nine Bends, roaming without bound and feasting in the Nine Heavens.

It further states: The Ninth Completion Duke, the Nine Heavens Venerable, rides a flying phoenix and a dark dragon, wandering above the Whitewater Sands and the empty mountains.

The *Scripture of the Golden Root* states: The boundless heavens of the Dark Mound Jade Kingdom, the misty shores of the Ninefold Citadel—this is the birthplace of the Azure Essence Emperor Lord.

*Volume Eight of the Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* concludes.
*Volume Nine of the Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns*
Compiled by Wang Xuanhe, the Feathered Guest of the Tang’s Vast Sea
*On Kalpas and Cycles*

The *Scripture of the Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens of Highest Clarity* states: The heavens are round, governed by twelve celestial nets; the earth is square, ordered by twelve terrestrial records. The celestial net revolves through its pivots, three hundred sixty wheels completing one cycle. The terrestrial record’s mechanism turns, three hundred thirty wheels making one degree. Three thousand six hundred celestial cycles constitute a yang surge; three thousand three hundred terrestrial degrees form a yin eclipse. Heaven’s qi culminates in the Supreme Yin; earth’s qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yang. Thus, when yang is stimulated, it surges; when yin is obstructed, it eclipses. When yin and yang surge and eclipse, the qi of heaven and earth reverse. The reversal of heaven and earth’s qi is called a minor kalpa. When minor kalpas intersect, the ten thousand emperors exchange thrones, the nine qi alter their courses, the sun and moon contract their motions, land surges from the Nine Springs, the Water Mother bursts through the Five Rivers, the Great Crow gathers at Dragon Gate, and the Five Emperors convene in the Dark Metropolis. At this time, the wicked and defiled perish, while the virtuous people endure.

Nine thousand nine hundred celestial cycles constitute a yang eclipse; nine thousand three hundred terrestrial degrees form a yin surge. When yang eclipses, qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yin; when earth surges, qi is schemed in the Supreme Yang. Thus, when yang is obstructed, it eclipses; when yin is stimulated, it surges. When yang and yin eclipse and surge, heaven and earth transform. The transformation of heaven and earth is called a great kalpa. When great kalpas intersect, heaven overturns and earth collapses, seas surge and rivers burst, people drown and mountains sink, gold and jade dissolve, the Six Directions merge into darkness, white corpses drift boundlessly, solitary spirits lament in the vast waves, the Great Crow sweeps filth from the sacred peaks, the Water Mother assumes office at the Nine Rivers, the Five Dragons exhale qi in the Northern Origin, the Heavenly Horses harness their reins to subdue demons, the Red Locks subdue spirits at the Gate of Chen, the Year Star extinguishes kings in the Golden Net, the sun and moon darken in the Three Eminences’ halls, the five qi halt their halos above the Nine Ridges, the Dragon King drums blossoms above the Eastern Well, the River Lord receives judgment beneath the Nine Seas, the Sage Lord manifests his chariot in the bright rosy clouds, and the Five Emperors examine the good and evil. At this time, the myriad evils are eradicated, ghosts and demons vanish without trace, and of the Eight Wastes and Four Extremities, not one in ten thousand remains. As for the convergence of heaven and earth, none but the Highest Three Heavens can avert it, and none without the Azure Registers and White Tallies can escape it.

It further states: The Celestial Pivot lies at the northwest corner of heaven, aligned with the Dipper. The Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper are the handle of the Celestial Pivot’s net, the canopy of the King of Dawn, the qi of the twelve celestial hours of the Nine Heavens’ Brahman conduct. When the Dipper’s net revolves, the Nine Heavens turn in unison. Heaven has four seasonal gates, and the Nine Heavens encompass thirty-six seasons. In one day and night, the Dipper’s net revolves through one seasonal gate. Over thirty-six days and nights, it traverses all thirty-six seasons. When the thirty-six seasons conclude, the Nine Heavens complete one wheel; three hundred sixty wheels make one cycle of the Nine Heavens. When the Nine Heavens complete one cycle, the qi of the Six Heavens all return to the Highest Three Heavens. Heaven alters its revolutions to hasten their degrees, and three thousand six hundred cycles constitute a minor kalpa. When minor kalpas intersect, the nine qi are rectified, the ten thousand emperors exchange thrones, people perish and ghosts vanish, the good and pure are governed, and the Six Directions are pacified and unified.

Nine thousand nine hundred cycles mark the end of a great kalpa. When a great kalpa ends, the numbers of the Nine Heavens are exhausted, and the revolutions of the Six Heavens are spent. When the Six Heavens’ revolutions are spent, qi is stimulated in the Three and Five, and malevolent spirits rampage, seizing the moment to act, spreading poison and annihilating people. All this arises from the exhaustion of revolutions and the extremity of numbers, riding the opportunity to stir, thus reaching this state.

The earth’s mechanism lies in the southeast quadrant, beneath the Nine Springs, where the mouths of the Nine Rivers inhale and exhale. The numinous mechanism connects upward to the celestial source’s molding flow, and laterally swallows the abyssal inlets of the Nine Caverns. The twelve terrestrial records push the waters of the Four Convergences; in one day and night, qi swells as they converge at the mechanism of the Nine Rivers. Over thirty-three days and nights, the mechanism turns northwest, unfolds northeast, and contracts southwest. When it unfolds, it overflows; when it contracts, it wanes, cycling through the Four Convergences. The celestial source’s downflow surges in waves—this is called one turn. Three hundred thirty turns make one degree. One degree compels the Water Mother to hasten her meeting with the Dragon King, and the River Lord to receive judgment from the Three Heavens. Three thousand three hundred degrees are called a yin obstruction. When yin is obstructed, it eclipses. When yin eclipses, waters surge, rivers burst, mountains sink, and earth vanishes. Nine thousand three hundred degrees mark the end of a great kalpa, the extremity of yin’s revolutions. At this time, the Nine Springs surge in vast waves, the Water Mother drums at Dragon Gate, mountains and seas merge into darkness, and the Six Directions lie flat. This is the triumph of yin’s revolutions, the stimulation of earth’s qi.

It further states: On the seventh day of the seventh month of the first year of the Red Essence Kaihuang era, at the bingwu hour of midday, [the Perfected One] ascended to the Moon’s Upper Palace in the Jasper Metropolis, received talismans from the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, opened the Golden Yang Jade Casket and the Dark Harmony Jade Maiden’s oral command, and issued the register of the August People. From the three luminaries’ radiance before the Kaihuang era to the Kaihuang era itself, countless kalpas have passed, and the successes and failures of heaven and earth cannot be recounted. The Nine Heavens Venerable, in the Kaihuang reckoning, calculated the celestial origins, examined and predicted the kalpas’ revolutions, recorded the names of those who attained the Dao in the Azure Registers and White Tallies, and inscribed the register of the August People. The numbers culminated in Tang Yao—this was a minor kalpa. At its intersection, gains and losses amounted to two hundred forty thousand people. Those destined to attain it, from the time after Tang onward, numbered forty-six. Between the dinghai year and the preceding and following years, in the jiashen year, the minor kalpa’s convergence occurs, and people’s names are determined.

At this juncture, the Yang’s ninefold calamities and the hundred-sixth cycle of qi converge, the two qi part and unite, and fortune and misfortune intersect—those who pass through shall be spared! Yet after the jiashen year and before the jiashen year, at the inception of the renchen year, nine cycles have revolved, and by the gengzi year, the omens of fortune and misfortune manifest, the Dao’s course becomes clear and bright. A crimson star shall appear in the east, a white comet shall trespass the moon’s gate, monstrous offspring shall emerge from the mouths of insects, and rebellious hordes shall fill the rivers of Yue with corpses. People shall devour their own kind, smoke shall vanish for ten thousand li, mighty ministers shall claim dominion, and feeble lords shall be shrouded in dust. Thereafter, the five numinous spirits shall blaze with auspicious signs, their virtue uniting with the root, and from the lineage of the Dragon Essence shall arise a sovereign who restores the clan. He shall pacify the four barbarians, and those who answer the celestial tally shall prosper.

In the era of the Dragon and Tiger, the three-sixth cycle shall summon forth; the people shall suffer no untimely deaths, and the throne shall know no peril. After Tang, the forty-sixth dinghai year marks the completion of three minor kalpas. Furthermore, from the fifty-fifth dinghai year to the renchen and guisi years, this is the great kalpa’s cycle. When the great kalpa’s cycle arrives, heaven and earth shall overturn, gold and jade shall dissolve, people shall sink into mountains and vanish, and the six directions shall merge into darkness. The revolution of heaven and earth’s destiny—how can one resist its course? Only those inscribed in the Azure Registers and White Tallies of the Three Lofty Heavens may spread their vast wings and soar, ascending the clouds with unblinking gaze!

This is the decree of the Jade Maiden of Mystic Harmony, the discourse of the Golden Yang and Jade Casket on the successes and failures of heaven and earth, the right and wrong of fortune and misfortune.

The *Scripture of Soaring through the Eight Luminaries* states: When the great kalpa’s cycle arrives, the three paths wax and wane, the two qi unite and part, and the ordering of things reaches its term. In the era following Tang, the Yang’s ninefold calamities shall dispel disasters and eliminate misfortune beforehand, vigorously seeking the perfected transcendents above.

The *Precepts of Lord Lao* states: Westward in the Flowing Sands lies the Boundless Land, where a colossal stone stands three hundred zhang high, its circumference spanning fifteen hundred li. To the north of this stone lies Mustard Seed City, its walls forty li square, with stone altars on all four sides, each twenty zhang high. Once a year, flying immortals place a single mustard seed within this city, and with a sweep of their robes, they brush the colossal stone until it wears away, indistinguishable from level ground. When Mustard Seed City is filled with mustard seeds, the cosmic cycle completes, and the world ascends one stage.

The *Essential Rites of the Numinous Treasure Retreats and Precepts* states: A stone like Mount Kun, with mustard seeds filling a forty-li expanse, and celestial beings in gauze robes—once every hundred years, they brush this stone until it is worn away, removing a single mustard seed. Such is the duration of a kalpa’s end; who among mortals could comprehend its vastness?

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Revolutions of Heaven and Earth* states: The Numinous Treasure’s natural revolutions encompass the great Yang’s nine and the great Bo’s six, as well as the minor Yang’s nine and the minor Bo’s six. Three thousand three hundred years constitute the minor Yang’s nine and minor Bo’s six, while nine thousand nine hundred years constitute the great Yang’s nine and great Bo’s six. The heaven’s tribulation is called the Yang’s nine, and the earth’s depletion is called the hundred-six. After the Jin clan’s era, in the jiashen year, the revolutions of heaven and earth’s fortune and misfortune shall conclude at the convergence of the Yang’s nine. At that time, the Dao and virtue shall become manifest, and malevolent forces shall run rampant. The sagely ruler shall assume his mandate in the renchen year. It further states that in the Water Dragon era, the immortal lord shall draw the bow and the eighteen sons shall emerge—this scripture contains ten clauses, which are not recorded here in full.

*Laozi as the Imperial Preceptor’s Rank*
*Scroll Eight of the* Tai Ping Section: *The Transmission of Laozi’s Scripture, Precepts, Rituals, and Essential Instructions* states: Laozi is the great sage who attained the Dao, the teacher of both the hidden and the manifest. When responding to conditions, he transforms and adapts to all directions; when his work is complete, he conceals himself and abides in constancy. Abiding without abiding, he is ever-present without absence; the absence within presence resides in the boundless; the boundless’ bound resides in the Supreme Mystery. The Supreme Mystery is the capital of the Supreme Ancestor’s ultimate dominion. Laozi dwells here, his transformations responding to the ten directions, unfolding the wonders of being and non-being, and endlessly engaging with all things—beyond description.

In recent times, he emerged into the world and was born at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. Descending in humble guise, he was born among the common folk, demonstrating that even those of lowly birth may cultivate the Dao and attain it without hindrance. He traversed the six voids and taught across the three realms. The Dharma beyond the world and the Dharma within the world, the active and the quiescent—none did he fail to fully explore.

During the reign of King Wen of Zhou, he served as the Keeper of the Archives. Some say he lived in the world for over two hundred years, and in the forty-third year of King Ping’s reign, in the year *guichou* of the sexagenary cycle, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month, he expounded the *Five Thousand Character Text* to the Pass Prefect Yin Xi.

The *Scripture on the Conversion of the Barbarians* states: After Fuxi, Laozi was born and became the teacher of emperors, styled Master of Profound Clarity, also called Master of the Fields and Wilds, and composed the *Scripture of Primordial Yang*. During the time of Shennong, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Great Accomplishment, also named Master Guo Cheng, and composed the *Scripture of the Primordial Essence of the Great One*. During the time of Zhu Rong, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Transmitted Foreknowledge, also named Master of Broad Longevity, and composed the *Scripture on Massage and the Circulation of Essence*. These three lineages cultivated together, each governing through non-action, and after eighteen thousand years, brought about Great Peace. The people were pure and simple, and no further governance was needed. Only the natural *qi* of non-being served as the law, without coercion or conquest. The *qi* of the Dao returned to them, and none failed to submit. These were the sovereigns of the Three August Ones.

During the time of the Yellow Emperor, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Broad Accomplishment, and composed the *Scripture of Dao Attainment*. During the time of Emperor Ku, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of the Green Chart, and composed the *Scripture of the Yellow Court of the Dao and Its Principles*. During the time of Emperor Yao, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Accomplished Service, and composed the *Scripture of Proper Affairs*. During the time of Emperor Shun, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master Yin Shou, and composed the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. The Yellow Emperor was supremely sagely, enabling the imperial enterprise to be passed down in succession. Lifespans varied in length, corresponding to the Five Phases, alternating in mutual conquest and dominance, with the strong and weak oppressing one another. These were the Five Emperors.

During the time of the Xia kings, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master Li Zixu, and composed the *Scripture of Primordial Yang*, as well as the *Scripture of Virtue and Admonitions*. During the time of King Tang, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Bestowed Principles, and composed the *Scripture of the Origin of the Dao*. During the time of King Wen, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master of Harmonious Settlement, also called Master of Vermilion Essence, and also served as Keeper of the Archives. During the time of King Wu, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Master Guo Shu, also called Master of Continued Accomplishment, and served as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. During the time of King You, he emerged as the emperor’s teacher, styled Heavenly Elder, also called Laozi, and served as the Archivist Beneath the Pillars. He composed the *Scripture of Longevity* and, together with Yin Xi, composed the *Five Thousand Character Text* in two scrolls. Later, he traveled with Yin Xi to the Western Regions and composed the *Scripture on the Buddha’s Conversion of the Barbarians* in six hundred forty thousand characters. After returning to China with the barbarian king, he composed the *Scripture of Great Peace*. In later ages, he will remain among humankind, desiring that the people of the world cultivate goodness and righteousness, revere and uphold virtuous transformation, assist the Dao and its laws, support the state and sustain destiny, labor for the welfare of the common people, and deliver them from calamitous years, enabling them to encounter the midst of the Great Clarity.

The above, like a cascading river, is now called the *Dao and Its Virtue*. The preface states: "Laozi served as the state teacher in every generation"—this is the meaning of that. Master Meng Zhizhou’s *Comprehensive Titles of the Laozi Scripture* says: "One thousand two hundred Laozi." This refers to those one thousand two hundred, as Laozi himself had other scriptures. It also states: "Later disciples achieved this, as with Boyang." Thus, it is known that the honorific title Boyang originated in the prosperous Zhou era. This title, whether hidden or manifest, is difficult to thoroughly investigate.

The *Jade Emperor’s Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages* states:
*"Subtly the divine artisan,
The numinous virtue, empty and rare.
Illuminating dragon patterns in the azure abyss,
Radiating cloudlike splendor in the nine heavens.
Washing his lofty form in orchid and jade,
Emitting golden essence from the jasper spring.
Arranging the seven records in the celestial register,
Clarifying the inscribed scriptures in hidden scrolls.
Encompassing the sunken and the bold,
Revolving the stagnant wheel.
Gathering the five symbols,
Assembling the perfected of the highest realm.
Truly the Highest’s descending transformation,
To spread teachings to all directions."*

The *Scripture of Great Peace* on Laozi’s conversion of the Western Barbarians states: Laozi traveled west for over eighty years, having been born between the Yin and Zhou dynasties.

Master Guigu’s *Inner Transmission of the Perfected Lord of the Unsurpassed, the Pass Prefect, and the Venerable Master of the Beginning of Literature* states: In the first year of the Zhou’s *Wuji* era, in the year *guichou* of the sexagenary cycle, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of winter, Laozi crossed the pass. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi instructed the gate officers: "If an old man arrives from the east, riding a blue ox and a simple plank cart, do not allow him to pass." Later, they indeed saw an old man fitting this description seeking to cross the pass. The gate officers refused, reporting Yin Xi’s words to him. The old man said: "My home is east of the pass, but my fields are west of it. I wish to go gather firewood—please allow me to cross." The gate officers again refused entry and reported to the Pass Prefect. The Prefect immediately went out to greet him and paid him the respects due a disciple. The old man initially declined and sought to depart, but the Pass Prefect earnestly faced north and served him. Laozi consented and stayed.

At that time, Laozi had a hired laborer named Xu Jia, who was paid one hundred coins per day. Laozi had previously made an agreement with him: "I will repay your wages in full, but I must first travel to the Western Sea, the Da Qin, and the Anxi kingdoms. Upon my return, I will repay you in gold, fully covering the amount owed." Xu Jia, seeing that Laozi was about to embark on a distant journey, doubted he would return and thus refused to wait for his wages. At that time, a beautiful woman, hearing that Xu Jia was owed a large sum, sweetly said to him: "Why not sue immediately to claim your wages? I will be your wife." Xu Jia, swayed by her words, filed a complaint with the Pass Prefect, suing Laozi for the money. The Pass Prefect presented Xu Jia’s complaint to Laozi. Laozi said: "My salary is meager, and I have no servants. I previously hired this man and told him that upon returning from the Western Sea, Da Qin, and Anxi kingdoms, I would repay him in gold, fully covering the amount owed. How have I broken our agreement to be sued?" Xu Jia had followed Laozi for over two hundred years and was owed seven million coins. Laozi said to Xu Jia: "I once told you that upon returning from the Western Sea, Da Qin, and Anxi kingdoms, I would repay you in gold. Why could you not endure the humiliation and now bring a lawsuit against me? You have followed me for over two hundred years, and your life should have ended long ago. It is only by virtue of my *Tai Xuan* talisman of longevity residing within you that you still live."

Upon finishing his words, Laozi saw the *Tai Xuan* talisman of longevity fly from Xu Jia’s mouth and return before him, its script fresh and luminous. Xu Jia had already crumbled into a pile of white bones. Xi, witnessing Xu Jia’s death for betraying his heart, then wished to see Laozi revive the dead. He said: "I shall repay this debt on his behalf. I have prepared the coins—may you pardon Xu Jia’s past transgressions and grant him new life." Laozi, moved by compassion, replied: "Very well! This was never my anger toward Xu Jia; he betrayed his original resolve, and the Dao departed of its own accord." Laozi then cast the talisman once more onto the withered bones, and Xu Jia revived as before. Xi explained the situation to him, and Xu Jia kowtowed in gratitude and repentance. Laozi instructed: "Return what you owe," and dismissed him.

Laozi descended to serve as the Zhou preceptor in the first year of *Shang Huang*, the *dingmao* year, on the twelfth day of the first month, the *bingshen* day. As the Zhou’s Way was nearing decline and the king neglected virtue, unable to govern the people through the Dao and virtue, this age of excess and chaos could not be restored. Thus, the Preceptor traveled in humble attire, intending to journey far away. Xi again bowed and said: "I beseech you, Master, to compose a text for me, expounding the meaning of the Great Dao, that I may uphold and cultivate it." In the first year of *Wu Ji*, the *guichou* year, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month at noon, Laozi composed the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls and bestowed it upon Xi.

Laozi prepared to depart. Xi said: "May I follow you, Master, on your distant travels and witness the transformations of heaven and earth?" Laozi replied: "My path has no fixed abode—I may ascend to heaven, descend into the earth, scale mountains, or plunge into the sea. I may dwell in the lands of the Rong, Di, Man, and Mo, in realms beyond human reach, among spirits and demons, or in perilous straits. I observe the transformations of the ten directions, passing through all barriers, appearing and vanishing at will. You, having only just received the Dao, have not yet purified your impurities—how could you follow me on such a journey? Remain here and recite these two scrolls ten thousand times. When the Dao is perfected within you, then you may accompany me. When your cultivation nears completion, I shall come to receive you. For now, you may not depart."

As Laozi was about to leave, he instructed: "After a thousand days, seek me at the marketplace gate of Chengdu, at the stall of the green sheep." Xi reverently followed his teaching, reciting the scripture ten thousand times. After a thousand days, his body could fly, and he walked through fire and water without burning or drowning. Now that his Dao was perfected, he went to the marketplace gate of Chengdu, to the stall of the green sheep, to seek Laozi. After searching all day without success, he spent the night in longing. On the ninth day, he saw a man come to buy green sheep. Thereupon, he understood and asked the servant: "Why do you buy these green sheep every day?" The man replied: "My master has a distinguished guest who favors green sheep, so he sends me to purchase them." Xi said: "I once had an old acquaintance with that guest. We agreed to meet here—could you convey a message for me?"

Xi then presented precious treasures to him. The servant said: "Very well. You may follow me, and I shall fully convey this message." Xi said: "If so, tell the guest that Guanling Yin Xi awaits outside." The servant relayed his words as instructed. Laozi said: "Summon him forward." Brushing his robes, he rose and ascended his seat of natural lotus, then asked Xi: "Since we parted these three years, what gains and losses have you found in reciting the scripture?" Xi bowed and declared: "By following your teaching and reciting the scripture, I have attained perpetual life without death."

Laozi said: "You once wished to accompany me on distant travels—now that your Dao is perfected, we may journey beyond the eight limits of the great earth." Xi replied: "My long-held wish is at last fulfilled; I have no regrets remaining." Thereupon, Laozi ordered the carriage prepared, and they roamed far between heaven and earth, transforming through many lands. Later, they entered the hermitage of Mount Grdhrakūṭa in the kingdom of Yanbin. As the king of Yanbin was traveling abroad, he asked: "What manner of man is this?" His attendant replied: "A Daoist." The king said: "How does a Daoist come to dwell in seclusion here?"

The next day, upon seeing them again during his travels, the king asked: "What practice do you cultivate that may bring fortune?" Laozi said: "Through fasting, moderation in eating, reciting scriptures, and walking the Dao—above, one may attain the True and achieve deathlessness, transcending birth and death, with transformation and passage governed by intent; below, one may secure the state and prosper the household, or follow the turning of the body to attain the Dao, transcend the world, and enter non-action." The king said: "Excellent!" The following day, as he traveled forth, he saw them once more.

The king asked: "What is most valued in the Daoist arts?"

The Daoist replied: "Our Way prizes naturalness, purity, stillness, and non-action. Through fasting, moderation in eating, and burning incense, one may ascend to heaven, be born into the households of kings and marquises, or follow the Dao to transcend the world—this is the highest attainment."

The king said: "Excellent! I wish to invite the Daoists to partake in the midday meal and practice the Dao. Would that be permissible?"

The Daoist asked: "How many would you invite?"

The king said: "All of them."

The Daoist replied: "There are too many disciples to provide for."

The king laughed and said: "I rule a great kingdom—what could I not obtain? How could I be unable to provide?"

The Daoist said: "We Daoists are but poor followers of the Way, relying on the king’s support. Even the treasures we possess belong to the king. Now, I first wish to invite the people of the kingdom to partake in the midday meal, that we may pray for blessings on their behalf. Would that be acceptable?"

The king said: "Very well! Though I fear the Daoists lack the means to provide for them."

The Daoist replied: "We have sufficient provisions. I humbly request Your Majesty’s presence."

The king said: "I shall arrive on the appointed day."

The Daoist then first invited the ministers and the people of the kingdom, sending immortal youths and jade maidens, along with flying immortals from the four directions, to summon men and women for fourteen days. When all had gathered, the king sighed and said: "Even a poor Daoist can perform such great blessings—how could I, a great king, lack anything and claim inability to provide?"

On the appointed day, he invited the Daoist disciples to a grand assembly. As they arrived, they brought forth the nine ranks of celestial sages and immortals, with over forty days of arrivals unceasing. Later, each day brought strange and varied guests—some Hu, some Cang, some Wu, some Chu—some tall, some short. Half the king’s granaries and treasuries were depleted, yet the people kept coming.

The king said: "As the Daoist said, why are there so many? I truly fear exhaustion and lack of provisions, and suddenly a wicked thought arose: *I suspect this old man is a demonic spirit, not a worthy sage.* Bind the Daoist quickly, pile firewood in the marketplace, and burn him to death as a warning to the people."

Thereupon, they bound Laozi and his disciples. Laozi, unperturbed, allowed them to act, gathering firewood in the city square. He then said to Xi and the other perfected ones: "Simply follow me atop this pyre. Though the entire kingdom comes to watch, they will be unable to harm us."

When the people of the kingdom saw this, those of good heart all exclaimed in dismay: "Why does our king do this?"

The people pleaded desperately for the Daoist, yet he was burned midway—how pitiable, how lamentable! The flames soared to the heavens, and as the kingdom’s people watched, Laozi radiated a body of light that filled the world. Amid the smoke and embers, Laozi, Xi, and the perfected ones sat upon lotus blossoms, holding the *Dao De Jing* and chanting its verses. Even as the fire raged fiercely, they remained seated upon the coals, unmoving.

The king asked, “Is the old master dead yet?”
The messenger replied, “The old master still sits upon the embers, reciting the scripture.”

The king then ordered Laozi to be cast into the deep abyss. Yet when they followed him into the depths, he did not drown. The people saw Laozi emanating light, borne upon a divine dragon whose radiance also illuminated the abyss. There he continued his recitation, untouched by harm.

The king asked, “Are the Daoists dead now?”
The messenger said, “When cast into the deep abyss, the Dragon King emerged to bear him up. The old master’s light shone throughout the kingdom, and again he neither drowned nor died. What is to be done?”

The king said, “Burning him does not kill him, drowning him does not submerge him—what can I do?” Turning to his ministers, he asked, “Could that old master be a heavenly teacher, a sage? Now I wish to serve him—what say you?”

The ministers replied, “Excellent!”

Fearing the old master’s wrath would bring ruin to the kingdom, the king was advised to humble himself and offer apologies. The king replied, “Just so.” He personally approached Laozi and recounted the past events, prostrating himself in apology.

Laozi said, “Earlier, I warned you that you might be unable to provide for us, yet you turned and burned my disciples. How could you defy Heaven and act so lawlessly? Heaven does not permit your wanton slaughter of the innocent. It is because Heaven sees my innocence that I have passed through these perils unharmed. Heaven is about to destroy your kingdom—its fall will come soon.”

The king deeply apologized, admitting his guilt, and pledged to place the entire nation in service to the master, vowing never to grow negligent. Laozi said, “Though you now bow your head a thousand times, your past malice makes your sincerity uncertain. I fear you may yet regret this. What oath will you swear?”

The king replied, “From this day, I shall have all men and women of the kingdom remain unmarried for life, shaving their heads and beards as a covenant. If I break this vow, may I die as proof. How is this?”

Laozi said, “Good.” Then he appointed Yin Xi as the master and commanded the king and his people to serve him. The king was to entrust governance to his crown prince, Yili, while he himself would cultivate the Dao, abandoning his kingdom to seek liberation for the world.

Laozi said, “Excellent! If you wish to renounce your kingdom and study the Dao, I shall leave you a teacher, who shall be called *Fofo*, to serve the Supreme Perfect and True Way. The Dao possesses great methods: if you remain in your kingdom to cultivate, simply uphold the Five Precepts and the Ten Virtues, and you will attain blessings, dispel misfortune, perpetually dwell in the human realm, and enjoy honor, wealth, and nobility. Through this, you may also attain the Dao and liberate the world—why must you abandon your home?”

The king and his ministers all bowed their heads before the master, and on that same day, men and women alike took up the Dao. They were given the three monastic robes, instructed to guard and refine their minds, and given staffs to ward off snakes and insects. They observed moderation in alms-begging as discipline.

Laozi then composed ninety thousand volumes of scriptures and precepts, which they began reciting that very day. Laozi said, “Now that I have transmitted the Dao to you in full, I wish to swiftly journey to the eight directions.” He then returned to his eastern travels, where he expounded the primordial qi of the Great Dao in seclusion, establishing three teachings: the first was the *Supreme Boundless Great Dao*, the second was the *Supreme Perfect and True Way*, and the third was the *Great Peace and Austerity Way*.

The *Scripture of Laozi’s Conversion of the Barbarians* states: “During the reign of King You, I emerged as a teacher to instruct in the methods of the Dao. Observing the emptiness and fullness of the times, I served as the Archivist Under the Pillar, surnamed Li, named Er, styled Boyang. Knowing King You could no longer be guided, I resolved to depart, for this age of decline and chaos could not be endured. As King You of Zhou was about to lose his kingdom, I disguised myself, riding a black ox and a simple wooden cart, and left.” Thus, King You was indeed slain by the Great Rong.

Then he journeyed westward to the kingdom of Jibin, arriving at the Hangu Pass. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi was devoted to the arts of the Dao and inner cultivation, versed in celestial patterns above and terrestrial principles below. Foreseeing that the Dao would pass westward, he observed the heavens day and night. At that time, in the twelfth month of the *guichou* year, on the twenty-fifth day—the end of the La festival—the Dao indeed came, crossing the pass from the east. Prefect Yin Xi had previously instructed his gate officers: “Today, an old man riding a black ox and a simple wooden cart will come to cross the pass. When you see him, detain him and do not let him leave!”

As foretold, Laozi arrived at the pass riding a black ox and a plain wooden cart. The officers detained him, refusing passage. Laozi said: “I am but a poor old man living east of the pass, with fields to the west. Tomorrow is the La festival, and I wish to gather firewood. Pray, allow me to cross.” The officer knelt and replied: “The Prefect has ordered that if an old man riding a black ox and a simple wooden cart appears, he must be detained. I beg you to stay a moment.” The officer then entered to report to the Pass Prefect.

The Prefect, bearing his seal and tablet, came forth to welcome him and prepared a ritual reception. Laozi said: “I am but a poor old man living east of the pass, with fields to the west. Tomorrow is the La festival, and I wish to gather firewood. Why detain me?” Yin Xi knelt, holding his tablet, and said: “I am Yin Xi, a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery. From birth until now, I have lived through three thousand *jiazi* cycles. I have sought you through hardship and exposure, and by heaven’s grace, we meet today. I beg you to stay a while.”

Laozi entered the lodge, and they spoke for three days and nights. Yin Xi prepared a lavish feast, and Laozi, feeling he had no way to repay such generosity, composed the *Five Thousand Character Text* in two scrolls—the *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures*—and bestowed them upon him in gratitude. Then he prepared to depart. Yin Xi said: “May I know your honorable name?” Laozi opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue, saying: “All my teeth have fallen out; only my tongue remains.” Yin Xi said: “Lao Dan’s teeth numbered thirty-six in his mouth, white as frost. Now they are all gone, and only the tongue remains. Thus I know that the soft can overcome the hard, and the weak can conquer the strong. I wish to cultivate the resolve of softness and weakness.” Laozi did not disclose his name and departed.

Yin Xi said: “I admire the beauty of the Dao and virtue; I wish to follow you westward.” Laozi replied: “I wander beyond the bounds of heaven and earth, dispersing my *qi* to the eight directions. Sometimes I visit small kingdoms, sometimes ascend to heaven or descend into the abyss, teaching and transforming wherever I go. How could you follow me?” Yin Xi knelt and said: “I would enter water or plunge into the abyss, ascend to heaven or descend into the earth, risking my life to follow you.” Laozi said: “Diligently study the *Five Thousand Character Text*—the *Upper* and *Lower Scriptures*. Three years hence, seek me at the Green Ram Market in Chengdu. You will find me there.” Yin Xi could not follow him then, and so, in the *guichou* year, they parted.

Yin Xi thereafter devoted himself to the scriptures, practicing day and night without rest. His primordial *qi* returned to his body, and each day his understanding of the Dao deepened, confirming its truth. Later, in the *dingsi* year, he traveled to the Green Ram Market in Chengdu to seek Laozi. Days and months passed without success, and he sighed in longing. Then he noticed a man who came daily to buy green rams. His heart opened in realization, and he asked: “Why do you come every day to buy these green rams?” The man replied: “My master has a distinguished guest who favors green rams, so he sends me to buy them.” Yin Xi said: “I once had an appointment with that guest here. Could you convey a message for me?” He offered precious treasures. The man said: “Very well. Follow me, and I will inform him.” Yin Xi said: “If so, tell your master that Yin Xi is outside.” The man relayed the message as instructed.

Laozi said: “Let him enter.” He brushed his robes, rose, and ascended a natural lotus throne, grasping a nine-jointed staff. Seeing Yin Xi, he said: “Why are you late? I have waited for you a long time.” Yin Xi bowed twice and said: “I have sought you for days and months, not knowing where you had gone. The Dao does not betray its promise. Now that I see you, your grace is as vast and deep as the heavens! How could I forget anything from these three years?” He prostrated himself and said: “Since parting from you, I have studied the scriptures you gave me day and night, memorizing them without fear of forgetting. Malevolent spirits and demonic thieves, seeing me, naturally submit. The myriad spirits flee before me. I have come to know the boundlessness of primordial *qi*.”

Laozi said: “I have waited for you a long time, knowing your unshakable resolve. I shall take you on a distant journey to observe the primordial *qi* between heaven and earth and preserve your bodily form. Is this not excellent?” Then, in the *dingsi* year, he took Yin Xi to the western lands, wishing to teach the people of those kingdoms without being recognized. Arriving in the kingdom of Jibin, they entered the mountains, dwelling in caves and practicing the Dao for three years.

In the *gengshen* year, the Hu king went hunting and repeatedly saw them. He asked his attendants: “What manner of men are these?” None could answer. Laozi replied: “I am an old man who has long dwelled in these mountains.” The king found this strange, suspecting them to be mountain spirits, unaware they were sages. He was determined to harm Laozi. Laozi, embodying the resolve of softness and weakness, humbled himself and prepared a feast of the *Supreme Boundless Celestial Kitchen*, inviting the people of the kingdom. The king, hearing this, clapped his hands and laughed: “This old man depends on our kingdom for his livelihood. How could he invite our people?” Laozi said: “I have relied on the king’s land to live until today. Now, as I prepare to return to the eastern lands, I wish to repay the king’s kindness. Let us set a date for the gathering.”

The king dispatched envoys to inspect the preparations for Laozi’s feast. Laozi had arranged tents woven from the qi of the Five Phases: white silk in the Western Valley, black silk in the Northern Valley, azure silk in the Eastern Valley, crimson silk in the Southern Valley, and yellow silk at the center. He invited the king himself, along with all the people of the kingdom. The Hu king then summoned thirty-six nations, numbering millions, to gather within Laozi’s five-colored cloud-silk tents. They feasted for seven days and seven nights, the banquet ever-abundant, without weariness or exhaustion.

Upon returning to his kingdom, the Hu king wished to invite Laozi again. Laozi replied to the king: “I cannot be invited.” The king said: “In my great kingdom, what is there that we lack? Why should I be unable to invite you?” He set a date for the gathering.

On the appointed day, Laozi arrived with his fellow Daoists. Four groups of disciples attended him, along with the Four Heavenly Kings and a million followers—each day, one kind of person. The next day, a different kind of person arrived, and each day thereafter, the people were unlike the last. This continued for over forty days, with guests arriving without end, until the king’s kitchens were exhausted.

The king was greatly alarmed and said to his attendants: “This is some demonic trickery—he cannot be an ordinary man. What is to be done? Kill him!” His attendants replied: “It can be done!”

In the city’s marketplace, they piled firewood and set it ablaze. If he did not die, they would take a great stone to strike his head and cast him into the sea—would he then remain undying?

The Hu king commanded every household in his realm to bring a bundle of firewood, which they heaped in the marketplace and set alight. Laozi and Yin Xi were placed atop the pyre by the Hu king. The prince lit the fire below, and it burned for over forty days until the wood was consumed and the flames died out. Yet Laozi and Yin Xi sat amid the embers, reciting scriptures as before.

The king then had Laozi and Yin Xi bound with great stones and cast into the deep abyss, but again they did not sink. The Hu king was struck with terror. What was to be done now? The entire kingdom trembled in fear, desiring to attend Laozi as their master.

Laozi said to the king: “I am not the master. The one who was burned with me atop the pyre—that is the master. He has now gone to the heavens to summon troops and will come to punish your kingdom for your earlier attempt to burn and kill us.”

In an instant, the armies of the heavenly spirits descended—hundreds of thousands strong, each standing fourteen feet tall, wielding iron staves. They filled the kingdom, arriving without end each day, intent on slaying Jingzi and the king himself. The Hu king was seized with terror, and the thirty-six nations all lost their souls. The king prostrated himself, face to the earth, not daring to look upon Laozi.

Laozi then transformed into a mighty five-colored figure, his body sixteen feet tall, adorned with the seventy-two marks, his radiant purple countenance manifest in the empty sky, moving left and right, now descending, now ascending—this was the form of the *Shifang Kong’er Xu Shen*.

The Hu king, trembling in fear, said to his attendants: “Bring forth the one we held before—this great being!”

Laozi, knowing his intent to submit, replied: “This is no great being, but one known as the Supreme Perfected. The true perfected ones cherish life and abhor killing. I came to your kingdom without transgressing against you—why then did you heap firewood to burn me? And now, what is this desire to attend me? Do you seek escape?”

The Hu king said: “Grant me life, save my kingdom. I pledge my life and heart to you, O great one. From this day forth, I swear never to transgress against you.”

Laozi said: “What will you offer as proof?”

The king replied:

The men and women of my kingdom, young and old, shall never marry, but serve the Master until death, beseeching forgiveness for my sins.”

Thereupon, he summoned the princes of the thirty-six Hu states. Before Laozi, they all shaved their heads and beards, disfiguring their appearance, wearing skirts with the right arm bared, pledging to heaven as witness and swearing upon the earth. With hands clasped and palms joined, they dared not shift or alter their stance.

Seeing the Hu submit to transformation, Laozi then composed a scripture of sixty-four myriad words, the unsurpassed and orthodox Dao of true perfection. He commanded the king to have his entire kingdom follow its laws: they must not raid nests or break eggs, harm any living thing, commit robbery or theft, bully the weak, utter curses or slander, drink wine or eat meat, or engage in reckless speech or double-tongued deceit. They were forbidden to ride in carriages or on horses, or to wear sandals or shoes. He fashioned for them a tin staff, so that when struck against the ground, it would startle insects and prevent them from being harmed.

Fearing they might relapse and regret, he also made for them the three robes of the Dharma, leaving the left arm bare while the right arm was always bound before the heart, the right hand gripping it to prevent the mind from straying. He forbade them from tilling the soil or carving wood, instead providing a begging bowl to hold seven *sheng*. They were to beg for food in accordance with the movements of the sun and moon, receiving one *sheng* from each household. After visiting seven households, they would have seven *sheng*, and upon receiving it, they were to eat. If they failed to obtain food after seven households, they were to reproach themselves. If they went seven days without food, they were to drink only water. This was established as the rule.

The *Scripture on Transforming the Barbarians* originally comprised two scrolls with differing content. Here, their discrepancies have been reconciled, and this text is recorded accordingly.

*Timely Observances* Section.

The Most High Lord of the Great One expounds in the *Mysterious Clouds of the Cavernous Truth*: "Those who ascend at dawn in broad daylight do so when the sun is at its zenith—this is ‘broad daylight’—or at the first crow of the cock, which is ‘ascending at dawn.’" The *Scripture of Illuminating Truth* states: "One who attains transcendence ascends at dawn in broad daylight—this is the meaning." All such moments are chosen for their vital qi.

The *Explication of the Controller of Destiny* says: "Departure in broad daylight is called the ‘upper corpse-liberation.’ Departure at midnight is called the ‘lower corpse-liberation.’ Departure at dawn or dusk is called ‘becoming a master beneath the earth.’"

The *First Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: "The six periods—dawn, midday, sunset, first watch, midnight, and cockcrow—are times to pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, beginning with the east."

The *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity* says: "The days of *jiazi* and the eight solar nodes are all times for the upper court’s morning audience and feast."

The *Scripture of Soaring through the Eight Luminaries* states:
- On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), the Three Primordial Ladies of Pure Simplicity ascend to the Celestial August Thearch for a feast—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Primordial Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity ascends to the Highest Jade Sovereign for a feast—this is the day to begin practicing the Dao of the Nascent Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), the Three Primordial Perfected of the Great Ultimate ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace for a feast—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Mysterious Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), the Duke of Fusang, the Great Thearch, ascends to the Grand Tenuity Palace for a feast—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Void Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), the White Thearch of the Primordial Simplicity ascends to the Jade Heaven and the Highest Perfected of the Mysterious August for a feast—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Primordial Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), the Red Thearch of the Southern Culmen ascends to the Terrace of Soaring Winds to feast with the Lady of the Nine Numina—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Radiant Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), the Perfected of Highest Purity, the August Ancestor Thearch, ascends to the Highest Nine Heavens to feast with the Jade Emperor’s Son—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Cavernous Luminance and receive transcendence.
- On the day of *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), the Jade Consort of the Great Empyrean and the Perfected of the Great Void ascend to the Palace of the Great August to feast with the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity—this is the day to practice the Dao of the Pure Luminance and receive transcendence.

This has been recorded in advance. The full account appears in the *Section on the Eight Solar Nodes’ Days of Fasting* in the ninth scroll of the *Daoist Precedents*.

**Chapter on Knocking Teeth and Swallowing Saliva**

The *Golden Script and Jade Characters of the Upper Canon* states: At night before sleep, always silently knock the teeth three times seven, and swallow saliva three times seven.

The secret invocation reads:
*"Nine Stars, Great Essence,
North Culmen Perfected Lord,
Augment my essence-womb,
Fortify my three hun-souls.
Draw the sun’s radiance from the left,
Gather the moon’s essence from the right.
At the hour of the Yellow Splendor,
Primal Void’s Yellow Perfected,
Let me ascend as a flying immortal,
Mounting the purple mist.
The Jade Talisman of the Spirit-Void
Ever guards the Gate of Life—
Myriad evils submit to the law,
Receiving form from the Dipper Lord."*

At dawn upon rising, always silently knock the teeth two times seven, and swallow saliva two times seven.

The secret invocation reads:
*"Heaven’s Primal One,
Seven Lads within the Dipper,
Purple Essence of the Upper Clarity,
Dwell within my body.
Flowering Morn’s Purple Canopy,
Mystic Palace of the Great Simplicity,
The Sacred Qi of Later Sages
Descends into the Grotto-Chamber—
Let me ascend as a flying immortal,
Attain the Golden Hall of the Great Ultimate."*

The *Five Talismans* states:
*"Bowing to rinse the fivefold flowery liquid,
Restore the youthful countenance.
Raising to draw the essence of the Three Luminaries,
Preserve the body in eternal peace."*

Knocking the teeth summons the spirits; swallowing qi harmonizes the true. Inhaling harmony and swallowing the six fluids to circulate them, regulating the spirits requires sounding the drum to marshal their ranks—this is called "calling the spirits."

The *Declarations of the Perfected*, Scroll Five, states: When walking at night, one should always click the teeth—there is no fixed number, for it slays demonic and perverse forces. Demons constantly fear the sound of clicking teeth, and thus dare not assail one. If combined with rinsing saliva and reciting invocations, it is even better.

The immortal Liu Jing told Huangfu Long: Upon rising in the morning before washing, sit upright, rinse the mouth’s spittle as "jade spring," let it fill the mouth, then swallow it, knocking the teeth two times seven to conclude. Then rinse and spit again as before, and knock the teeth again in the same manner. Knocking the teeth summons the spirits within the body, settling them, and also prevents the teeth from decaying. Swallowing saliva makes the body lustrous and moist, strengthens vigor and complexion, expels the Three Corpses worms, and is called "refining essence," enabling longevity. If practiced throughout life, one attains immortality.

The *Scripture of the Cavern-Spirit’s Hidden Writ of the Supreme* states: Those who study the Dao must sound the Heavenly Drum to summon the host of spirits. In the practice of right contemplation, to prevent the encroachment of perverse qi, one must assemble the multitude of spirits for self-assistance.

Knocking the left side is the Heavenly Bell; knocking the right side is the Heavenly Chime; knocking the center above and below in opposition is the Heavenly Drum. Sometimes thirty-six knocks correspond to the thirty-six heavens, the thirty-six states in the middle, and the thirty-six lands below. Or thirty-two knocks correspond to the thirty-two heavens; or twenty-seven knocks correspond to the nine heavens’ three-times-nine count, totaling twenty-seven. Or twenty-four knocks correspond to the three-times-eight twenty-four spirits; or twelve knocks correspond to the twelve earthly branches; or nine knocks correspond to the nine origins; or seven knocks correspond to the seven origins; or three knocks correspond to the three origins. Knock according to the number’s correspondence.

If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens, strike the Heavenly Bell thirty times. When traversing mountains to repel evil, recite mighty invocations and strike the Heavenly Chime. When meditating on the Dao to summon spirits, sound the Heavenly Drum. Obstruction in swallowing disrupts the mind’s focus; thus, one must swallow saliva to irrigate the hundred spirits, then tranquilly guard the Three Ones’ spirits. The number of swallows corresponds to the same counts as sounding the Heavenly Drum.

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection*, Scroll Four, states: Ingest the Jade Maiden’s saliva, visualizing the sun and moon within the mouth—the sun’s color is red, the moon’s yellow; the sun has nine rays of purple light, the moon ten rays of white light. The rays are straight as strings, entering the mouth; swallow the luminous liquid, practicing this endlessly in secret.

Earlier methods of ingestion all include this swallowing of saliva.

The *Declarations of the Perfected*, Scroll Five, citing the *Great Simplicity’s Scripture of the Cinnabar Splendor*, states: On the face, always rub the hands until warm, then stroke upward and downward following the contours, pressing thoroughly to make the face lustrous and prevent wrinkles and blemishes. Practicing this for five years, one’s complexion becomes like a maiden’s. First rub the palms until hot, then stroke the face and eyes; comb the hair with the hands as if arranging a hairpin. Alternate the arms, rubbing them with the hands to prevent hair from whitening and veins from protruding.

The *Essential Splendor Massage Chapter of the Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Upon rising from sleep, sit upright and regulate the breath. First clasp the hands, then cover the back of the neck, tilt the head back to gaze upward, and make the neck compete with the hands three or four times to harmonize essence and circulate blood, preventing wind-qi from entering. Long practice averts death and illness. Afterward, flex the body, extend the limbs to the four extremes, arch backward, and shake all joints three times each.

Upon rising, first use a hand towel or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears until smooth and warm. Stroke the hair and massage the neck as if arranging a hairpin, without ceasing. After a while, rub the hands and massage the face and eyes. Long practice brightens the eyes, repels perverse qi, and prevents the body from becoming greasy and foul. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluids.

The *Scripture of Subduing Demons and Ascending Spirits* states: If the body feels unwell, press the tongue against the throat, rinse and swallow saliva endlessly. Soon, the discomfort will vanish, and one will feel the body relaxed and supple.

The *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Subduing Demons* states: Frequently press and rub the ears on both sides, alternating without count, to sharpen hearing.

The so-called "nurturing and governing the city walls" is recorded in the *Imperial Register*. It further states: Press the nose on both sides without count, to balance one’s qi. This is called "irrigating the Central Marchmount" and is recorded in the *Emperor’s Record*.

The *Upper Scripture of the Supreme Record of Serene Florescence* on massage methods: At the time of living qi, swallow saliva fourteen times. When finished, press the painful areas of the body, face the sovereign, and recite: *"Left Mysterious, Right Mysterious, the Three Spirits unite as one. Left Yellow, Right Yellow, the Six Flowers harmonize. Wind qi and malignant illnesses retreat to the four directions. Jade fluid flows with luster, ascending and descending freely; within, it dispels water and fire, without, it repels misfortune. Long life and flying transcendence—may the body be at peace and strong."* When finished, swallow saliva fourteen times. Practicing this regularly will prevent illness. Press the painful area thirty-one times without delay.

The *Scripture of the Three and Five in Crimson and Purple* states: When seated, one should often close the eyes and inwardly observe the five viscera and intestines. With long practice, they will naturally become distinct and clear.

The *Scripture of Red Characters on Stone* states: Often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, gaze inward, and gently breathe. After a while, saliva will form in the hands; use it to massage the face and eyes. Regular practice makes the body fragrant.

The *Purple Radiance of Blazing Light Scripture: Inner Vision Method* states: Often close the eyes and lie down, settle the body, and breathe gently, as if asleep, so that others do not notice. Then inwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, directing the ears and eyes to ten thousand *li* beyond. With long practice, one will naturally see things ten thousand *li* away. With focused intent, one may see a hundred thousand *li* beyond. The ears will also constantly hear the sounds of gold and jade, strings and bamboo—this is a wondrous method.

The *Scripture of the Three Celestial Passes* states: Often press the areas near the nose beside the eyes with the hands, pausing when the qi flows through, then exhale and begin again. Regular practice enables penetrating vision.

The Dao states: Often press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-six times, then rub the face above the eyes with the palms and fingers. Rotate the ears thirty times, massaging frequently without fixed intervals. When finished, stroke the forehead upward thirty-six times, beginning between the eyebrows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva as much as desired without count. Regular practice brightens the eyes, allowing one to read at night within a year. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum without speaking of its method. The downward pressure beneath the eyes is the secret to preserving the eyes and returning to the infant’s Dao. Rotating the ears with the hands is the technique of "probing brightness and reflection." Thus, the blood flows and disperses, wrinkles do not form, and the moon’s radiance and mysterious illumination harmonize essence and spirit. When a person grows old, it rarely does not begin with the ears and eyes. The signs of aging also first appear beside the eyes. Press the forehead, inwardly visualize the Red Child and the twin luminaries of sun and moon, rejoicing in the Upper Prime, thirty-six times beginning at the eyebrows. This is called "the hands paying homage to the Three Primes," the Dao of fortifying the brain and strengthening the hair. Cover the four sides of the head with both hands, smoothing the hair toward the topknot, as much as possible. Thus, the blood of the head flows and disperses, and wind-dampness does not congeal. When finished, press the four corners of the eyes thirty-six times until the light is clearly seen—this is the method of refining the eye spirits. With long practice, one may see the hundred spirits. Diligently practicing this, keeping the hands never far from the face, is best. Even after attaining transcendence, one should not abandon it. Upon waking at night, always knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then press the sides of the nose up and down dozens of times. Softly recite: *"The Four Luminaries of the Supreme, the Nine Gates emit essence. Ears and eyes profoundly clear, communicating with the real and reaching the numinous. The Terrace of Heaven’s Center, flowing qi harmonized. The Cloudy Maid’s graceful bearing, the Eye Lad’s brilliance. Flowering hearing and radiant clarity, the hundred arts subtly refined. Preserving and uniting the Upper Prime, wandering the Nine Cities. The five viscera take root, ears and eyes naturally arise. The Heavenly Terrace’s pure simplicity, its pillars and beams unshaken. The seven *po* refined, the three *hun* at peace. The Red Child carries the light, ever accompanying me. Should any dare obscure my ears and eyes, the Supreme will crush them with flowing bells. The ten thousand evils vanish, all wishes are fulfilled. Sun and moon guard the gates, the heart stores the five stars. The True Sovereign’s incantation—let all echoes heed with reverence."*

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: When combing the hair, do so many times to circulate the blood and qi and disperse wind-dampness. Frequently change combs, alternating their use. One need not undo the hair.

The *Scripture of the Great Ultimate’s Verdant Radiance* states: When combing the hair, face the sovereign’s direction. At the beginning of combing, softly recite: *"Mysterious Flower of the Mud-Pellet, preserving essence and ensuring its long abiding. Left as the Hidden Moon, right as the Root of the Sun. The Six Harmonies purified, the hundred spirits receive grace."* When finished, swallow saliva three times. Regular practice prevents hair loss and promotes daily growth. Frequently change combs, combing thoroughly without causing pain. One may also have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly. Thus, the blood and fluids do not stagnate, and the hair roots remain firm. Before sleeping at night, first tightly close the eyes upward, then press and wipe with the backs of the thumbs, crossing both palms at the crown of the head thirty-six times. Inwardly visualize three colored qi—purple, cyan, and crimson—emerging before the eyes. This is the inner pressing of the Three Primordial Clouds, irrigating and uniting with the Lad. Secretly recite: *"Eye Lad of the Three Clouds, True Lords of the Two Eyes. Brilliance infuses essence, opening and clearing the pure spirit. The Supreme Mystery’s numinous bearing, the graceful and soaring Numinous Maid. Preserving the double passes, unlocking the Nine Gates. The hundred joints respond in harmony, morning fluids irrigate the Mud-Pellet. The body ascends to the Jade Palace, ranked among the Upper Perfected."*

These forty-eight characters recited, swallow saliva fifty times. When finished, then open the eyes. Make this a regular practice—it may be performed sitting or rising, not limited to night, but must be done at the time of generative qi. After a year, ears and eyes will become keen and bright. With long practice, one may see through a thousand li, perceive the radiance of spirits, and hear beyond silence. This is indeed a lofty Dao of the perfected immortals, not merely for brightening eyes and opening ears.

Those who wish to study the Dao should strive to keep their affairs concealed from others, as Master Meng transmitted in seclusion. Before sleeping at night, first recite the *Huangting Neijing Jing* once, then sleep, so that the hun and po souls may be refined and restrained. If practiced constantly for twenty-one years, one may attain immortality. This is said to require ten thousand recitations—three or four each evening is excellent. Lady Jiang of the Northern Peak said: reciting this scripture also keeps one free from illness. It is the Dao of not dying. A note says: reciting it once each evening for twenty-one years does not reach ten thousand. The character "one" may be a corruption for "seven" or "eight." Otherwise, three or four recitations per evening suffice.

Whenever studying the profound Dao or reciting sacred scriptures, for every ten or twenty words, one should once or twice lick the lips and swallow saliva; for every fifty or a hundred words, two or three times knock the teeth, to harmonize spirit with the numinous origin, regulate blood and qi, and condense the subtle fluids until they fill the abode of the Supreme Unity. This is what is meant by "the qi flows without labor, the blood does not leak."

In the method for students, one must not weep tears or spit excessively, for these deplete the fluids and leak the essence, causing the throat and brain to burn dry. Thus, perfected persons and Daoist adepts constantly practice exhalation, inhalation, and swallowing to harmonize the six fluids.

On the day of one’s natal sign, face its direction, knock the teeth three times, and silently bow twice while reciting: *"The Supreme Unity governs life, the Three Qi unite with the true. The womb-chamber ascends to the Upper Radiance, mother mysterious and father primordial. They give birth to my five viscera, gather my spirit. Below, they irrigate the Jade Fluid; above, they ascend to the Mud-Pellet. At dusk, refine the seven po; at dawn, harmonize the three hun. On the right, command the Jade Splendor; on the left, summon the Golden Dawn. Let me become a spirit immortal, commanding the numinous and employing the divine. Constantly preserve the beneficent fluids, soaring through the Ten Heavens."* When finished, silently bow to the four directions and knock the teeth three more times. This is called the Dao of the Supreme Lord’s "Concealed Morning Audience of the Womb-Origin." Practicing it constantly secures the hun and po souls, ensuring long life and immortality.

*The Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll Eight* states: Long ago, there was a man named Bao Zhu from Jibei. He neither studied the Dao nor knew any methods or arts. At over forty years of age, he suddenly contracted a wind affliction that twisted his mouth and eyes, causing his upper and lower teeth to constantly clatter together with a loud sound, day and night without cease. He lived to be 127 years old, and later perished by falling into the Longevity River during a great flood. The Northern Emperor had repeatedly sent demon-slayers and the Day-Wandering Earth Calamity Envoys to take him, yet these executioners dared not approach. The demon officials questioned the reason, and the celestial slayer replied: "This man employed many methods to restrain his ordinary state, knocking his teeth and sounding the Celestial Drum to alert the spirits within his body. The spirits could not scatter, and demonic qi could not enter, so there was no opportunity to kill him." By this reasoning, had Bao Zhu not crossed the river by water, he might have lived a thousand years—his lifespan was not yet exhausted. It was merely an accident of extreme cold; stepping into the water, his mouth clenched and he could no longer knock his teeth, thus meeting his fate by drowning.

Those afflicted with wind disease whose teeth chatter of their own accord still repel death and ward off demon-slayers—how much more so for Daoist adepts who truly knock their teeth and sound the Celestial Drum to summon the spirits of the body!

The *Immortal Methods* states: constantly swallowing saliva and knocking the teeth makes one return to youth. The *Purple Radiance of Blazing Light Scripture* says: swallowing saliva preserves the complexion and protects the teeth. The highest method for seeking immortality states: at the dawn hour when the Two Qi have not yet divided, let the mysterious radiance illumine body and spirit. Body and spirit descend together, ascending to meet the Mud-Pellet, and essence and fluids are generated. Swallowing at this time, after three years the face will glow with jade-like luster, the countenance will transform, the neck’s radiance will be firmly rooted, and the teeth will grow square and even. With constant cultivation, the Five Elders will descend to one’s chamber, and the spirit immortal will ascend to the Mysterious. Lifespan will equal the Three Luminaries. This is the Dao of not dying—do not transmit it to the unworthy.

At that time, calm the mind and settle the intent, still the five spirits, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize the Azure Maiden of the Eastern Essence, bearing the qi of Lesser Yang, the Jade Nectar of Azure Mushrooms, irrigating and rinsing one’s body, flowing and overflowing within the Purple Tenuity Palace. Recite: *"Azure Teeth of the East, drink the morning radiance. Jade nectar and sweet springs, cascading fluids in torrents. Flowing to moisten the six palaces, the mysterious infusion like a river. The body light, ascending to tread the Supreme Rosy Clouds."* When finished, with the tongue lick the outer side of the upper teeth nine times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Vermilion Maiden of the Southern Round Jade, bearing the qi of Greater Yang, the Jade Nectar of Crimson Mushrooms, irrigating one’s body and flowing into the Crimson Palace. Recite: *"Vermilion Teeth of the South, drink the sweet springs and crimson mushroom jade nectar. Flowing and overflowing like a river, spreading moisture through the Crimson Palace. The bones transform and generate spirit, consuming the Great Void. The entire body becomes immortal, riding clouds and driving the dawn, ascending to stand before the Emperor."* When finished, with the tongue lick the outer side of the lower teeth eight times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Pristine Maiden of the West, bearing the qi of Lesser Yin and the Jade Nectar of White Mushrooms, irrigating one’s body and flowing into the Canopy Palace. Recite: *"White Teeth of the West, drink the numinous fluid. Jade water in mighty flow, the mysterious mushrooms resplendent. Irrigate my six palaces, secure the hun and solidify the po. The spirit rests in the stomach duct, the name inscribed in the Golden Register."* When finished, with the tongue lick the inner side of the upper teeth six times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Mysterious Maiden of the North, bearing the qi of Greater Yin and the Jade Water of Black Mushrooms, irrigating one’s body and flowing into the Great Granary Palace.

Recite: *"Black Teeth of the North, consume the mysterious essence, drink my flying spring, nourish me with jade sweetness. The spirit’s palace shines resplendent, like cinnabar, like mushrooms. Lifespan rivals heaven and earth, boundless as the aeons."* When finished, with the tongue lick the inner side of the lower teeth five times and swallow.

Next, visualize the Yellow Pristine Maiden of the Center, bearing the qi of Central Harmony and the Elixir of Yellow Water and Moonlight, irrigating one’s body and flowing into the Jade Hall Palace. Recite: *"Yellow Teeth of the Center, white stones towering. When hungry, consume the elixir of jade sweetness; when thirsty, drink the Yellow Water and Moonlight. The five viscera overflow, flowing and moistening like a river. Lifespan equals the Three Dawns, ten thousand without decay. Form ascends to the Nine Mysteries, controlling and riding the flying clouds."* When finished, with the tongue lick the inner and outer sides of the upper and lower teeth on all four surfaces, then press the tongue against the Mysterious Throat, drawing the mushroom fluid twelve times and swallowing.

The method of swallowing fluid to preserve the teeth is what the Central Yellow Venerable Lord and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate constantly cultivate. Their complexion is like that of a youth, their skin like jade’s luster, their body full and qi abundant. Their white hair returns to black, their teeth take root firmly, without rot or loss. Thus they attain the descent of the mysterious, their names inscribed in the Immortal Registers, their rank ascending to the Pure Void, sharing the Emperor’s seat. If you cultivate this, you shall seek your name in the Golden Portal. Without the karmic affinity of the Jade Pavilion, one cannot unravel these mysteries.

The *Inner Sounds and Jade Scriptures, Upper Scroll* states: *"With the tongue stir the upper, lower, and center of the mouth, filling it with jade fluid, then swallow three times—this grants longevity and extends life."* If one serves the Blue Teeth of the East, consuming the Blue Teeth and drinking the Morning Flower, when finished, with the tongue stir the inner side of the upper teeth, lick the lips three times, fill the mouth with jade spring, and swallow. Here ends the tenth scroll of the *Three Caverns’ Pearl Bag*.
