**Preface to *Pan Xi Ji***

For forty years, the Elder of Jade Peak expounded the scriptures, yet worldly ties remained unsevered. In the spring of the *bingwu* year, he discoursed on the *Changes of Fu Xi* in the northern suburbs of Tiaoyin. Three immortals from Mount Long came to pay homage at his sacred palace, bearing in their satchel a scroll—composed by Qiu Changchun of Pan Brook to propagate the profound truths of the Dao and enlighten deluded companions. Upon unsealing and perusing it, one finds its prose bold and unbridled, its ideas fresh and extraordinary, far beyond the grasp of mundane scholarship.

Of old, Li Leran of Jade Palace and the Elder of Jade Peak both emerged from the gate of Zhanxiu Jue. Yet Li, with his innate wisdom, uttered words of mystery that startled all, unattainable by worldly talent. Having already prefaced and transmitted this work, how splendid! The wisdom of the Dao is not the wisdom of the world; the words of the Dao are not the words of the world.

How may this be verified? Mundane scholars, though they may puff their cheeks and grasp their brushes, do no more than sing of emotions and scour the world for scenes. Those who penetrate principle may illumine the boundary between Heaven and man, aiding the teachings of sages and worthies—even they may vie with the sun and moon in splendor. Yet those who awaken to truth are not thus confined: they utter wordless words, clarify the workings of creation, manifest the formless form, and cast off life and death. With effortless ease, untroubled by cogitation, they shake the void into thunder, and where no text is composed, constellations blaze forth.

The Elder of Jade Peak now bears witness among the immortals: unattainably high, he is high; unstriven for divinity, he is divine. Is this not because the one qi flows unimpeded, the six apertures stand wide, every gesture is wondrous, and every utterance rings true? Is this not the original state, rather than some borrowed passage? As *The Pan Brook Collection* says:
*Hand grasping the numinous pearl, ever wielding the brush,*
*Mind opened to Heaven’s music, no need to blow the flute.*

Again:
*Crowned with pine blossoms, eating pine nuts,*
*By the pine stream, drinking moonlit pine wind.*

Again:
*Gathering the triple summer heat from every mountain peak,*
*Transforming it all into a single ball of ice.*

Again:
*Existence and non-existence are self-determined—*
*What use then for craving and attachment?*

Again:
*Wine poured like golden dew,*
*Tea steeped with jade fungus fragrance.*

And in verse:
*All things laid down, all things are thus—*
*Why choose between flower-lined streets and willow markets?*
*The body of emptiness, originally one thing, without obstruction.*

Again:
*Roaming the world without moving the body,*
*Illumining the human realm, the mind rendered useless.*

Again:
*Wearing out iron sandals in vain—*
*Yet enlightenment dawns without leaving the hermitage gate.*

These few examples suffice; the reader will grasp the breadth.

Alas! The bonds of immortality today must belong to those who in former lives contracted such affinity. Long ago at Eastern Hermitage, I formed a bond with Wang Fengxian the Perfected; in Chang’an, with Ma Danyang. Last autumn, a man from Junzhou came, and I formed a bond with Tan Xian. Only Master Qiu dwells far away on Mount Long. Yet all these—all of them Fengxian’s disciples—have now entered into affinity with me, not by human effort but by destiny.

Though Master Qiu’s Dao was not revealed for my sake alone, its radiance is too vast to be concealed. Thus I, too, have come to share in this bond.

Written on a day in the fifth month of the bingwu year of the Dading era, by the Elder of Jade Peak, Hu Guangqian of Mount Zhongtiao.

The orchid grows deep in the forest, yet does not withhold its fragrance for lack of admirers. The crane cries in the distant marsh, and its call naturally reaches beyond. Men of lofty attainment and superior talent may dwell in seclusion, content with withered solitude in mountain fastnesses, or mingle unseen in bustling markets, lost in the dust. Though their abode be near, they seem distant; though their minds be still, their place feels remote. Drifting and floating, like a lone cloud in flight or an untethered boat, they appear and vanish between cinnabar skies and azure seas—where could they go and not be at ease?

With the Mysterious Origin as teacher and Supreme Harmony as companion, their distant hearts and untrodden paths abide in profound stillness and valley-like emptiness. They emulate the insightful ones who turn inward, follow the diligent practitioners of the highest order, cultivate truth and nurture life, and in leisure moments accumulate merit for others. They also give voice to their feelings in lofty verse and grand compositions, following the purple brush of the august sages to expound the empty songs of the Great Cavern. Their literary works and poetic lines have often appeared in the world.

Thus the orchid’s fragrance spreads, the crane’s call resounds. I have sketched this portrait: who, if not Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring, is such a one? A native of Qixia in Dengzhou, he studied alongside Masters Liu, Tan, and Ma under Wang Fengzi of Zhongnan. His name is renowned across the seas, revered near and far, and together with Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma, they are known as the Four Masters. Like the immortals and Daoist adepts of the ancient *Dispelling Delusion Treatise*, or the thirty-six methods of nurturing life to attain immortality as taught by the Most High—though dwelling in quiet obscurity among men—their disciples and followers, led by Qi, have come seeking a preface.

Though I have long wished to behold their works, it was only at this riverside frontier that I was granted the honor of glimpsing their magnificent compilation.

Appreciating their serene detachment and carefree ease, they roam unconstrained, even amid the vulgar and mundane. Like playful wanderers beyond the furrowed paths of brush and ink, their words remain uncarved and unpolished—neither cinnabar nor azure—just as the earthen drum and straw mallet seek no resonant performance, or the plain wine and simple broth offer no refined savor. Yet those who know music, who know beauty, shall find it here.

Tang’s Jiang Fang praised stillness, while Liao Chong of Fushan said: “The writings of immortals bear no literary art; their speech, no ornate phrases. Heart transmits to heart, unknown even to heaven and earth. They roam free in spirit—who in past or present could claim to rival them?” Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring echoed this.

On the winter solstice of the *dingwei* year of the Dading era, Mao Hui, Gentleman for Literary Composition, former Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Collator of Texts, Cloud-Banner Cavalier in retirement from Pingyang, composed this preface.

The subtleties of the Supreme Dao cannot be sought through sound or color, nor glimpsed through form or trace. They must rely on perfected beings to devise means of transmission—composing verses and selecting lines—so that others may recite and chant them, gradually entering the sacred realm and approaching the Mystery’s gate. Yet if phrases lack incisiveness and prose lacks depth, how can they captivate their age or inspire later learners?

Now, beholding Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring’s *Collected Works of Pan Creek*, I find that even a single word or phrase suffices to rouse the deaf and blind, to cleanse the dust of clamor. Was he not born with keen insight, dedicating himself to the Dao before reaching twenty? For over forty years, he has remained sleepless, recording three thousand words daily, traversing ten thousand *li* of land, storing the Three Teachings and nine schools within his breast, their radiance illuminating his spirit. Small wonder his fame resounds at the vermilion palace, where imperial edicts beckon, and his affinity with true immortals delights in the golden carp’s attainment.

Thus, among the thousands who followed Chongyang’s path, only Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma stood out as exceptional. Yet even among them, his lofty renown alone draws universal acclaim.

Recently, an old friend, Gong Hengdao of Longxi, journeyed from Donglai straight to the prefectural office of Fengcheng, earnestly entreating a preface for the collection. He bowed repeatedly, pressing his request again and again. Though I know my hands, calloused by sword and ledger, are ill-suited to capture even a faint likeness, I have long admired his reputation and regretted never having met him. Now, with the arrival of this season’s guest, the measuring line cannot be drawn back. With no way to decline, I reluctantly inscribe these few words.

On the second day after the Double Fifth Festival of the *bingyin* year of the Taihe era, Yila Lin, Grand General of Zhaoyi, Military Commissioner of Wuding Army, concurrently Surveillance Commissioner of Fengsheng Prefecture, Director of Ever-Normal Granaries, Defender-in-Chief, Marquis of Qishui Commandery with a fief of one thousand households and an actual enfeoffment of one hundred households, inscribed this.

Formerly, Master Zhuang composed thirty-three chapters, most of which employed parables and analogies. Later discussants of the Dao followed suit, taking the rejection of cleverness, the abandonment of excess, and the nurturing of spirit and qi as their foundation.

Regarding the guidance of common folk and the transformation of the obstinate—dispelling their delusions—even the most reticent cannot avoid resorting to speech. The eminent scholar of the Eastern Lands, Master Qiu the Perennial Spring, was born in Qixia of Dengzhou. A year before coming of age, he wandered to Mount Kunyu, where he encountered Wang Haifeng, the Master of Double Yang. With a single word, their Dao resonated, and he became his disciple. Wang bestowed upon him a poem, which read:

*"Gently I reel in the silk line,
Drawing you into Penglai, forever free."*

From this, one may discern how deeply he had penetrated the caverns of principle. After some time, he accompanied his fellow aspirants—Masters Ma, Tan, and Liu—in following the Master of Double Yang to Nanjing. Those who knew them called Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma the Four Friends of the Forest’s Edge. Before long, the Master of Double Yang relinquished his abode. The four escorted his coffin back to Zhongnan for burial, dwelling in a hut beside his grave. When the mourning period ended, each discussed where to go next. Only Master Qiu delighted in the customs of Qin and Long, residing six years at the Temple of Pan Stream and seven years on Mount Longmen. He begged for food and drink to sustain his days, and his reputation spread far and wide.

In the *wushen* year of the Dading era, Emperor Shizong, having heard of him, summoned him by imperial courier to the capital. There, he was granted a cap, sash, and robe, and received in the side hall. On four occasions, he presented verses long and short to expound the meaning of cultivating the True. The Emperor praised and marveled at them.

Following his return to the mountains, he engaged with the world and responded to custom, answering questions as circumstances allowed. His poems, hymns, and lyrics numbered no less than several hundred. Their words were forthright and their principles penetrating—truly one who, free from desire, beheld the wondrous, and through deep cultivation attained self-realization.

His disciples compiled his works into a vast collection, intending to carve them into woodblocks to spread their transmission, and sought a preface to place at the head of the volume. I would say: the ancient recluses fell into three broad types. Some roamed freely in the wilds, their names drawing others to follow, while the sovereign’s esteem led him to seek them out; some upheld unyielding conduct, unbending to worldly custom, and though they might respond to summons, they could never be fettered by worldly affairs, leaving all to long for their bearing; others, content with meager means and delighting in mountains and forests, fled into emptiness and never returned, so that the world forever exalted their virtue and could not speak ill of them. Master Changchun embodied all three, and thus it was fitting that he received the Emperor’s questions in rustic garb, inspiring admiration and longing from all quarters. He was no profit-seeking pretender who feigned reclusion to make a name, deceiving the foolish and hoodwinking the blind for personal gain.

The Master now resides at the Pavilion of Supreme Emptiness in Mount Qixia, and the day we might meet face-to-face and sit knee-to-knee has not yet come. This account of his life’s outline is offered so that, should we chance to meet in the future, he will not regard me as a stranger.

Written on the full moon of the intercalary fourth month in the *wuchen* year of the Taihe era, by Chen Daren of Andong, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, Concurrently Supervisor of the Directorate of Education, Light Chariot General, Baron of Yingchuan County with a fief of seven hundred households, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag.

*Panxi Collection, Volume One*
*Composed by Qiu Chuji, the Master of Everlasting Spring of Mount Qixia*

**Seven-Language Regulated Verse**

**Qin Chuan**
Qin Chuan, since ancient times the imperial domain,
Misty hues and auspicious qi arise and reign.
Every hill and stream in splendor stands,
All who dwell here vie in grace and grand.
Ten years of ardent resolve, high repose forgot,
Willingly I roam ten thousand li for the Way’s plot.
Like a lone cloud I drift to this land,
In misty grottoes refining the true and grand.

**Panxi**
Since parting from old friends, fate has spun its thread,
Wandering west, I dwell by the Hao River’s bed.
Through wind and dust, ten thousand li I’ve come,
Three years in cliffs and vales I’ve made my home.
Content with poverty, as now I know,
Who can match the ancients, their Dao to bestow?
Fortunate to find this pure and stainless ground,
I cultivate the true and sleep till sun is high unbound.

**Carving the Everlasting Spring Grotto at Panxi**
Towering peaks touch the clouded way,
Ten thousand ancient cypresses sway.
Sacred herbs hide from the vulgar eye,
Divine birds answer only the Daoist’s cry.
The grotto carved, immortals descend,
Elixir refined, all demons end.
Where else are blessed lands and famed peaks found?
Everlasting Spring—this small Penglai’s ground.

**Secluded Dwelling**
By the terrace, streams and valleys pure and bright,
Beyond the wilds, a mountain home, still and quiet.
At the frontier, clouds disperse, the sky gleams clear,
In the empty woods, night deepens, the moon sheds its cheer.
Eyes alight, gaze wide, the heart unfurls,
Hair unbound, robes loose, far from the world’s whirls.
I know how to steal life in these rocky lairs,
But who can unfold the Dharma-wheel’s affairs?

**Spring Dawn After Rain**
Rain clears, spring’s hues shine twice as bright,
Wind draws the sound of springs from emerald height.
Roosting crows chatter at dawn’s cunning art,
Travelers wander, lost to the night’s part.
Green trees rise uneven, fresh with grace,
Young shoots swell, vast in their place.
At the grotto’s mouth, the cranes of Penglai call,
From the sky’s edge, a lone raincoat answers the thrall.

**Resolute Will**
My heart for the Dao stands firm and true,
From youth I’ve worn the alchemical script’s hue.
Nineteen years in cliffs and vales I’ve hid,
Three thousand li as a tumbleweed I’ve slid.
No dreams of home bind my heart’s release,
With resolve, I’ll be an immortal beyond the world’s fleece.
Though blessings be light and demons’ snares tight,
Persevere—merit will make all right.

**Self-Portrait**
I wander clouds and waters, lone and free,
No love for the red dust’s fiery spree.
Ten thousand leagues of rivers and lakes my old trade,
A straw cloak and misty rain my life’s parade.
Drunk, I lie on rocks, robes open wide,
Awake, I stroll the woods, arms swinging with pride.
When night deepens and clouds part their veil,
In the moon’s glow, I play the flute’s tale.

**In Reply to Scholar Meng of Ganzhen, Beizhen Garrison (Nanchang)**
Ten years since I left my native ground,
A drifting cloud on rivers, I in Qin Chuan found.
Loose robes, patched when autumn winds arise,
Full, I sleep through nights in quiet guise.
In Shaanxi’s west, I shun the floating world’s din,
At heaven’s edge, I met the Great Luo’s kin.
Yet merit falls short of immortality’s vow,
I wait for glad tidings at Kuangyu’s brow.

**In Reply to Scholar Li Si, Inviting Me to Stay North of the Wei**
You wrote of poetry, years ago you pledged to cross,
But this year I must wander—my nature resists the Way’s gloss.
My body and heart follow sun and moon’s flow,
With cliffs and vales, I pass spring and autumn’s glow.
Deep in Guo’s town, many talents reside,
Far they seek Panxi’s reclusive tide.
Not that I refuse your northern abode,
Here too the true cultivation may be bestowed.

**Declining an Invitation from Daoist Friends to Visit the Temple of the Grand Duke at Panxi**
No wild whims urge me to roam,
Seeing through all, I let the world go.
Who seeks Panxi to ease their gloom?
In cliffs and vales, I linger slow.
Once three thousand li from the eastern sea,
Through twenty provinces my journey’s spree.
All famous mountains and scenes I’ve seen,
Yet nothing outside this body holds me.

**Seeking a Galloping Horse at the Panxi Temple**
I hear at Panxi the Grand Duke hides,
Where cliffs are high and trees dense, the shrine abides.
On flowered mornings, stone caves roar with dragon’s mist,
Moonlit nights, the temple gates howl with the wind’s twist.
For ten thousand years, the bear’s resolve stands tall,
Three springs, galloping steeds offer all.
With poetry, I seek a thousand steeds or more,
Ink-stained brushwork—my daily chore.

**In Reply to Magistrate’s Son, Scholar Xu**
Towering green junipers gird the sky’s rim,
Sheer cliffs cradle a hermit’s home within.
The jade grotto knows no lamp nor flame,
Green mountains all day wreathe in mist and frame.
An empty heart, a full belly—just rice I seek,
Guests welcomed, but no tea I brew to speak.
Content with quiet, I find my small delight,
Why boast of my door’s humble sight?

**In Reply to the Qinghe Clan**
Though born of mortal flesh, your spirit shines,
Your qi upright—fit for the Dao’s designs.
Yet fear the cinnabar sinks below your navel’s gate,
And white snow returns to chill your ear’s estate.
How to escape the red dust’s snare?
Like me, ascend the jade peaks’ stair.
Step by step, the Milky Way’s path I tread,
Wild clouds part as I rise, light as lead.

**To Secretary Qu of Jingzhou and Provincial Graduate Liu**
If Daoist friends seek me out,
No need for gifts or formal bout.
Worldly splendor cannot buy the Way,
Worldly ties but weary the heart each day.
Unlearned, indolent, my words are few,
In seclusion, years pass in quiet hue.
Beyond all cares, I cast them aside,
From the clouds, I listen to your lofty pride.

**To Wang and Zhou, Who Visited Me**
Why bring a meal, you two?
Beyond the walls, we roam the wilds anew.
Winding through villages, you seek the Way,
Lingering in its joy, you steal the day.
I know your old free spirit’s flight,
Far you gaze at Xinglü’s height.
All day we laugh and talk at ease,
Beneath the moon, we homeward please.

**To Fellow Daoists Inquiring About Cultivation**
My steps drift where they may,
What of cultivation can I say?
My Daoist eye lacks light, I shun the town,
Heaven’s heart eludes me—I drift with the flow’s crown.
Hungry, I beg from door to door,
Full, I sing with belly’s roar.
Beyond this foolish self’s display,
All else I know not, come what may.

**To Daoist Friends Seeking Worn Cloth and Old Sandals**
Six years in the western wastes I’ve stayed,
No new robes nor shoes have I arrayed.
Each mid-autumn, I patch my coarse cloak’s thread,
By autumn’s wind and rain, my sandals lie dead.
A body is easily clad in cold and hunger’s sting,
But without fortune, time stretches long, no joy to bring.

**May all of you hold compassion in your hearts,**
**And lend support to walk together toward the immortal realm.**

**Matching Rhymes for Scholar Zhang Yin of Yin County**
Mist and rosy clouds fill the valley thick,
In profound stillness, the heart mirrors emptiness’ trick.
Long songs sung where spring waters flow,
Alone I sit, watching clouds in dawn winds blow.
To shun harm, truly rely on the Dao’s might,
Yet bestowing kindness fails to grasp the divine’s light.
You delve deep into scriptures’ abstruse core—
Why seek the eastern glow when reflection’s at the fore?

**Borrowing Books from Scholar Zhang Wu of Yin County**
A noble house, its literary fame long known,
Orchids and jade trees fill the courtyard’s throne.
Generation upon generation, heroes arise,
Gathering often to discourse ‘neath virtue’s skies.
My humble talent embraced the Dao late,
Yet you, with vast learning, pierce the heart’s gate.
No need for idle jest or endless perusal—
Lend me more books to wander the ethereal.

**Mid-Autumn Moon Unseen**
For years the bright moon fails to shine clear,
In vain we set jade mats, yearning year after year.
Oft resentful when rain would intervene,
Who knew tonight clouds would veil its sheen?
Is the Moon Goddess lost in floral slumber?
Does the Jade Hare still pound elixirs in haste and number?
Worldly joys bring no true gain—
In the void beyond, conceal your light’s domain.

**Beholding the Moon**
Dense clouds retreat, the evening breeze grows still,
The radiant moon’s glow stirs the Nine Lands’ will.
Ten thousand leagues of azure sky bathe in its light,
Yellow leaves of autumn chill the four quarters’ flight.
From high above, the toad’s form seems to appear,
Across the wilds, specters are bound in fear.
Unfettered, round, and pure—solitary, bright,
It drifts beyond the dust, free from earthly blight.

**On the Moon Osmanthus at the Wang Residence (Borrowing Its Meaning)**
Within Taiyuan’s gates, the scene runs deep,
A cluster of immortal blooms outshines all time’s sweep.
Roots and trunk rise above the clouds’ domain,
Ancestors trace their lineage to the moon’s bright plain.
Fragrant buds, crimson-dusted, blaze,
Lush leaves, layered, lock in emerald haze.
Each blossom’s spirit transcends the mundane—
Soaring, they command the world’s acclaim.

**Planting Moon Osmanthus**
The craftsman’s hand seals the moon osmanthus’ planting,
The recluse tends the sacred flower’s dais, enchanting.
Its wondrous roots defy the common kind,
Its harmonious qi marks it as the Dao’s refined.
Sun and moon converge in timeless grace,
Heaven and earth alone command its place.
Noble scholars, cherish this eternal spring—
Do not mistake it for mere blossoms’ offering.

**Three Poems on Mountain Dwelling**
**I**
Dragon Gate’s waters flow, clear and bright,
Southward they surge ‘gainst Crimson Cliff’s height.
Ten thousand ravines’ springs converge in a rush,
A thousand crags’ stone walls echo with a hush.
They cleave the red dust’s realm in their winding flight,
Unfurling white jade’s essence in the light.
Endless wonders—words cannot contain—
I stand in the wind, brush in hand, to ordain.

**II**
No grudge for gathering firewood in the deep mountain,
For here, a pure elegance holds its own domain.
A stone chamber’s retreat nears the immortals’ land,
No need for walls—worldly affairs lie far and grand.
Feasting, I call to cranes beyond the sky,
Gazing up, I watch eagles in the gorge fly.
Ever the shifting scenes of black and white unfold—
True emptiness shines, dispelling solitude’s cold.

**III**
Alone in the mountains, solitude grows,
Idle clouds my companions, shielding from the world’s throes.
Indolent, I forget life’s clumsy art,
Loving stillness, I melt into the familiar part.
Why feign greatness to rival Li and Du?
Why strive to match the immortals’ view?
Probing life’s span and literary might—
Can they surpass the void’s creative height?

**Plantains on Longshan’s Slopes**
A single green leaf unfurls like a palm’s embrace,
Three cascades of white waves scatter petals in space.
Below the mountain, Yu’s temple overlooks the triple pool.
By day, guests come often to admire its rule,
Beneath the moon, none keep it company—alone it stays.
Creation’s vastness defies all compare—
Among grasses and trees, only the plantain holds sway.
Let not the common winds and rains its grandeur impair.

Let it stand daily as your golden table’s grace,
With guests, toast often from jade cups’ embrace.
When Master Mao studied the Dao in Qi,
No messenger was sent—yet golden tables and jade cups appeared nigh.

**In Praise of Dan Yang’s Longzhen’s Daoist Awakening**
Scholar Ma Tan reached the sacred court,
Doubt’s ancient tangle transcended in a single sport.
In clouds, he gathered herbs to simmer in the golden pot,
After fire’s trial, the elixir stored in jade ladle’s lot.
A luminous pearl in hand, he wields his brush with might,
His heart opened to celestial strains—no need for flute’s light.
Soon he’ll mount the crane, ride the wind away,
Between sea and mortal realm, his shadow fades astray.

**The Crane**
A spirit-bird of lofty nature and grace,
Cinnabar crowns its head, snow drapes its face.
Through vast seas it roams the Three Isles’ span,
Across long winds, its cry rings o’er the marshland.
Its spirit soars, untouched by worldly ties,
Its soaring ambition joins the immortal skies.
Beating the wind, it trims its wings on high—
Ten thousand miles it traverses, effortless in the sky.

**To Jia Gu Qingshen, Prefect of the Western Capital in Lingbei**
From the Eastern Sea, my wild gaze still strains,
The Western Capital’s prefect yet untouched remains.
Last year, I obeyed the edict to winter’s call,
This summer, your letter arrived in autumn’s thrall.
When will the northern post’s honors cease?
When shall I return to southern mountains’ peace?
Best make plans for Pengcheng soon—
The Yan family’s customs stand firm, immune to ruin.

**The Hall of Master Gong in the Western Mountains of Yizhou**
High above the clouds, Master Gong’s hall gleams,
Flickering rosy clouds bathe the cave in beams.
Peaks of a thousand fathoms flank its side,
Ten thousand pines and cypresses in waves abide.
The mountain elder speaks not of past or present’s lore,
Wandering guests arrive to discourse on the primordial’s core.
Say not a lifetime spent in seated stillness is vain—
It surpasses the world’s ceaseless, frantic train.

**Response to the Yellow Register Ritual at Fushan County (With Preface)**
In the autumn of *Mingchang Jia Yin*, the ninth month, a Yellow Register Ritual was held in Fushan County. On the twenty-eighth day, just before transmitting talismans and precepts, eleven cranes soared above the altar, lingering through the night. The next day, as the ritual commenced, the Celestial Gate shook with thunderous sound, and from the North Star descended a red glow, illuminating the earth so clearly that even the finest details were discerned—seen by all, officials and common folk alike.

Lamps of splendor gild a mountain of gold,
As if Penglai’s isle lies but a hand’s span from home.
The unenlightened turn their hearts to open earth’s gate,
While high immortals’ power stirs heaven’s domain.
A thousand doors array their offerings in solemn flame,
Ten thousand voices unite in joyful acclaim.
The merit complete across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,
Colorful clouds and immortal cranes return whence they came.

**After the Winter Solstice of Cheng’an Ding Si, Bitter Cold**
At times, affairs in the northern frontier unfold.

Before winter’s onset and after its close, snow stretches endlessly,
Pure yang qi sinks low, all things wither and dry.
Beyond the pass, horses startle at treacherous mountain paths,
Border guards endure hardship in iron-clad cold.
Though the northern frontier suffers bitter trials,
Fortune smiles on Shandong’s scholars and common folk.
Daily, the state expends three hundred thousand in resources—
How could lives not wither and fade?

**Four Poems on Flat-Top Hall**
*(At the Celestial Void Abbey of Misty Peaks)*

Year after year, during the triple-heat days, I ascend Flat-Top Mountain,
Where travelers seldom come and go.
Eyes gaze upon the pale azure skies, clouds drifting faint,
Body suspended in the azure void, nature at ease.
Solitary and lofty, it soars beyond peaks and ridges,
Its vast prospect unlike that between sea and Mount Tai.
Under the white sun, red-dust chariots and horses rush—
Who could come here to lean upon the railing?

The mountain hall stands high and pure, leaning against the cool heavens,
Beyond the sky, a clear breeze lingers in the seat.
The azure bird sometimes deigns to glance this way,
White clouds drift all day of their own accord.
Where lie the golden altars and jade terraces?
The crimson gates and jasper towers remain undocumented in ancient times.
How could they compare to this mountain retreat, where one rests and withdraws,
Body and heart unmoved, arriving at the immortal realm?

By day, the mountain hall is quiet, few visitors come,
Surrounding seats stand tall amidst emerald peaks.
The azure sky is flawless as the red sun turns,
Green mountains unmoving while white clouds fly.
All things, uneven yet distinct, reveal divine transformation,
The three spirits, distant yet bound, unite in harmony.
From beginning to end, it stems from the Dao of purity—
If one can embody it, heaven and earth all return to the self.

Three poles of red sun linger, yet sleep remains,
Ten miles of green mountains sit in tranquil repose.
Unaware of visitors beyond the secluded garden,
Only startled by a dog’s bark amid the white clouds.
With no intent, one naturally attains eternal wandering,
What need to ask of the great return?
Only fear that soon the celestial music will fade,
And no way to linger in joy upon Flat-Top Mountain.
*(Written in jest.)*

**Gazing at the Tides by the Sea**
When the great wind rises, the northern sea grows cold,
A thousand miles of towering waves roll like snow-capped mountains.
Their wrathful hue surges to the heavens, darkening the sky,
Thunderous roars erupt from the earth, startling the dusty world.
The river god churns waves in hidden submission,
The Yellow River’s spirit, shamed, overflows in sweat.
White horses and plain carriages hold but empty might—
Without immortality, no path leads to ascent.

**Inscribed at the Various Pan Abbeys**
Ten *li* southwest of the prefecture, I ascend,
Where springs and stones open wide to form a secluded dwelling.
Mountains deep and seas vast reflect each other,
The land remote, clouds idle, free to unfurl and gather.
Flanking paths, clear pools gleam with radiance,
Towering willows by the sky cradle the toad of the moon.
Playing the zither, seated before mist and rosy clouds,
I laugh and point to the toil of life—a fleeting dream.

**Mid-Autumn Day, Roaming the Various Pan Abbeys with Daoist Friends**
*(At a time when some were preparing for the autumn examinations.)*

The crisp air clears as summer’s heat wanes,
Gardens and groves shift into brocade patterns.
A long wind crosses the sea from the desert,
Short shadows traverse the sky past Jade Pass.
We set out mats to welcome guests by the Dragon Tree,
Play the zither awaiting the moon by Tiger Creek.
True companions naturally find the finest joys—
No need to pluck osmanthus in the Moon Palace.

**Autumn Dawn, Roaming West Creek with Penglai Daoist Friends**
Facing waters, ascending mountains, we ride the dawn wind,
With empty hearts and steady gaze, we witness the autumn sky.
Clouds veil the sea peaks in deepening emerald,
The sun strikes the celestial wheel in dazzling crimson.
Our wandering spirit does not turn with other things,
We harmonize with the world’s dust for a time.
Three years, four times we’ve shared this joyous gathering—
Again, we arrive east of the swelling sea, west of the mountains.

**Written En Route**
In the tenth month of the second year of Mingchang, I arrived at Misty Peaks.
In the fifth month of the third year, Penglai Daoist friends invited me to spend summer,
And thereafter, year after year, it became our custom—
Each fifth month, they would send for me.

Year after year in the fifth month, I come to Penglai,
Where wheat ripens like gold and silver, flowers bloom in succession.
Wandering guests sate hunger with purple mulberries,
Travelers quench thirst awaiting yellow plums.
Clouds billow atop the peaks, linking the towering mountains,
Waves surge at my feet, crashing from the sea.
In the vermilion summer, our excursions are grand and splendid,
Our feelings vast as the celestial net.

**Two Poems Seeing Off Scholar Chen and Attendant Perfect Man Wan-Yan to the Examinations**
Within the six directions, the myriad things are born,
Yet humans stand highest among them in clarity.
One who can fathom the yin-yang numbers beyond things,
And seize the world’s wealth and fame—
Of old, cinnabar required nine refinements,
But now the celestial path takes but three stages.
*(Referring to the three examinations of today.)*
With the talent of a banished immortal, nothing lingers,
Soon you will soar to the Great Clarity.

A man of lofty integrity, his qi soars above the clouds,
For a decade, he has quietly studied the myriad truths.
Though his belly is full of poetry and books, aligned with the Dao,
His outstanding talent has yet to astonish the world.
The strategies of the charging ox are unmatched,
The prose of the rearing steed is divinely inspired.
One day, when his work is complete and his heart awakens,
He will startle awake from the millet dream, his body still within.

**Frost on the Third Day After Clear Brightness, Taihe Xinyou Year**
Just after rain, we beheld the fairest of spring scenes,
When suddenly, before the wind, ten thousand flowers withered.
In a single night, gardens and groves lost their color,
The season of triple spring grows too desolate.
Just as the Eastern Lord displays his artistry,
How can one bear the Green Maiden’s proud might?
The suffering of living beings is hard to escape—
The root of creation remains untranscended.

**Falling Flowers**
Yesterday, flowers bloomed in crimson across the trees,
Today, flowers fall, leaving ten thousand branches bare.
Their flourishing relied on the splendor of triple spring,
Their transformation swiftly follows a night’s wind.
Beyond things, time flows naturally as it will,
Who among mortals can fathom birth and decay?
The great and small matters of glory and withering in a hundred years—
They pass before the eyes like a single dream.

**Setting Out for Penglai: Ascending the Mountain at Dawn for the Di Family Ritual**
Cocks crow, stirring the spirit,
Breath held, I ascend the mountain, body surging upward.
The path is treacherous, barely discernible,
The forest deep, travelers indistinguishable.
Parting the clouds, I gaze down upon the Eastern Sea,
The summit’s solitary height reflects the North Star.
Those who diligently practice goodness in daily life—
With empty hearts and steadfast resolve, they remain in the world.

**Proceeding to the North Sea Ritual in Weizhou**
*(Invited by Commander Wen-Di-Han.)*

The yin wind from the North Star sweeps across the sea,
The wind and scenery of sea and mountains turn desolate.
Mountain shadows accumulate snow, cold blankets the earth,
Layered ice on the sea freezes to the heavens.
Swans and geese flee a thousand *li* from the frontier,
Dragons slumber deep in ninefold abysses.
Why does this Daoist persist in folly?
Braving frost and ice to attend the ritual feast.

**Yellow Register Ritual in Changyang**
In the tenth month, Changyang’s five grains abound,
We recall the Yellow Register, erecting a pure standard.
Luminous lamps and feathered robes array the three halls,
Crimson banners and rainbow streamers descend from the nine skies.

**Ritual Ascends the Altar, a Thousand Gather**
Incense clouds weave a canopy as myriad spirits pay homage.
From this moment, blessings descend and misfortunes disperse,
A whole county stealthily shifts—hundreds of calamities vanish.

**Passing Mount Gongxian**
Gongxian’s jagged rocks forbid the horse’s tread,
Valley winds sigh, tigers elude the seeker’s gaze.
Mountains bristle like swords and halberds, vast and uneven,
Qi thickens in mist and haze, deep and obscure.
The Daoist throng does not idle to admire the scenery—
Every horizon is but a fine grove of trees.
Thus we proceed from the North Sea’s Yellow Register rites,
Wending eastward to Lai to pay homage at Emerald Peak.

**Avoiding Affairs, Passing Mount Gongxian**
Leisurely staff in hand, I tread the immortal’s trail,
Crossing stones and threading woods toward Master Gai.
The Western Sea’s clouds churn darkly,
The Eastern Mountains’ dawn sun veils the wild geese.
Ten thousand ravines twist in deep, hidden paths,
Three prefectures drift like tumbleweeds in the gloom.
In action or retreat, the heart remains unstained—
Let the staff strike empty space at will.

**Sudden Rain**
Myriad layers of dense clouds mass,
A thousand fathoms of white rain plunge from the mountain gate.
Yin and yang clash, wind and thunder rage,
Grasses and trees wail as the cosmos darkens.
Birds and beasts lose their way in the gloom,
Fish and dragons entwine in turbid waters.
In this instant, creation startles heaven and earth—
Who perceives the root within a hand’s span?

**Two Poems on the Great Snow of the Eighth Day of Late Winter**

**I**
Last night the south wind shifted to the north,
By dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.
Scattered pearls and shattered jade follow high and low,
Ten thousand ravines and a thousand peaks merge in sameness.
Sun and moon know not where to settle,
Mountains and rivers are sealed in boundless obscurity.
Only in returning to observe the principles of yin and yang and life’s nature
Do I recognize the workings of emptiness and creation.

**II**
Last night the south wind shifted to the north,
By dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.
Mountain hamlets and rustic inns differ house by house,
Willow fluff and plum blossoms are alike everywhere.
Clouds withdraw from pine halls and stone chambers,
Jade terraces and crystal pavilions gleam in the moonlight.
Why inquire further of the omen of a bountiful year?
This profound beauty is the very work of the Great Dao.

**Two Poems in Response to Prefect Zhang of Dinghai Commandery’s Visit in the Snow**

**I**
The ritual hall lies deep, its curtains undrawn,
In pure fasting, I sit in stillness, oblivious to schemes.
Heavenly flowers drift down in profusion,
The sea’s moon glows faintly over the vast mountains.
The pale sun drifts through the golden hall at dawn,
The piercing wind scatters jade-like dust in flight.
This auspicious snow of midwinter is true joy—
Yet through the ages, who discerns right from wrong?

**II**
Auspicious snow flutters, my rustic mood runs deep,
I open the gate, staff in hand, lingering at ease.
Greedily watching the six-petaled jade flowers fall,
I fail to notice the Three Clarities’ halls sealed in snow.
Dark fields and plains reveal jade steeds,
The palace’s eaves trail golden dragons in concealment.
Amid the cold crags, the lofty one stands—
Which distant peak is the first, the second, or the third?

**The Bamboo Pavilion of the Great Void Abbey**
This small pavilion’s secluded balustrade bears no flowers,
Only jade-green bamboo, sovereign of the year’s splendor.
Its upright stalks are no common grass or tree,
Its hollow heart truly befits the Daoist’s livelihood.
The wind’s soughing brings a chill fragrance,
The rain’s cleansing leaves it purer still.
It need not wait for the year’s cold to prove its worth—
By my chanting window, morning and night, it embodies flawless integrity.

**Reflections on Climbing Heights**
I urge my horse up the high ridge, its hooves unsteady,
Gazing upon the vast earth, my heart trembles.
Mountains and rivers stretch boundless to the sky,
Grotto heavens and immortals dwell far from the world.
White jade and yellow gold are never truly held,
Spring blossoms and autumn moons are never truly possessed.
A hundred years pass like a fleeting dream of floating life—
All things prove illusory, leaving only regret’s desolation.

**Two Poems for Master Liu Shiru**
Prefect of Dinghai Commandery, retired from office, Master Liu Shiru visits with his son at the Great Void Abbey in Qixia.

**I**
Several riders lightly depart the prefectural city,
The west wind sways, chrysanthemums gleam pure.
Reciting poems on horseback, no lance in hand,
I seek the Dao among men, briefly washing my cap strings.
Dew falls, the sky soars, autumn’s air is crisp,
Golden chimes and jade vibrations brighten the dawn clouds.
All day in the mountain hall, I sit in tranquil solitude—
As if sensing the floating life’s dream grow faint.

**II**
Master Shiru has a retreat for rest and repose, named the Central Chamber.
He further requests a poem.

That which is called the Dao is the interplay of yin and yang,
Excess or deficiency alike miss the mean.

**The Dao Encompasses the Three Vehicles**
The Dao encompasses the Three Vehicles, its mystery unfathomable,
At its center it embraces the myriad existences, its essence boundless.
The lofty man, though yet unenlightened, still seeks seclusion,
While the lesser scholar, once awakened, casts off ignorance.

The founders of the Three Teachings—Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist—
From ancient times to now, a thousand sages share one source.

**Matching Rhymes in Reply to Prefect of Fengsheng Commandery, Yila Zhongze’s Fine Verse**
No need for idle chatter, abandoning worldly schemes,
The great hermit need not dwell in a humble hut.
The ocean’s reflection shines, swallowing the jeweled moon,
The heart of heaven illuminates all things, outshining the cold pool.

In the *Yellow Court*, elegant strains rise in tripled melody,
In the *Purple Palace*, lofty verses flow with half-drunken joy.
O learned governor of the northwest, master of letters—
Would you deign to send your pearls and jade to the southeast?

**Seeing Off Prefect of Penglaizhou, Zou Yingzhong, Transferred to Yanzhou**
Since ancient times, few live to seventy,
Yet your deeds shine bright before twilight’s decline.
You long to retire, to plant chrysanthemums and depart,
But the imperial staff still commands, thwarting your heart’s desire.

Your course remains bound by the reckoning of yin and yang,
Day and night, you cannot escape the workings of change.
One day, when you doff your cap, do so early—
Lest those in the groves have cause to mock your delay.

**In Praise of the Dao**
Creation’s grandeur sways in boundless might,
The Three Luminaries turn through primal chaos day and night.
In darkness, yin and yang converge in splendor,
In wondrous transformation, spirits soar in myriad forms.

Spring departs, autumn arrives—life and death diverge,
Yet heaven endures, earth persists, ancient and now the same.
Within the numinous terrace lies a true message—
Without awakening, how can one’s nature be unobstructed?

**The Enlightened Scholar**
Adapting to circumstances, he meets the world yet remains dust-free,
Responding without fixed form, his inner spirit attains mastery.
His mind transcends the three realms’ suffering,
Roaming the grotto-heavens, he enjoys eternal spring.

The Golden Elixir, the great medicine, ripens over years,
Fire-jujubes and celestial pears renew with each passing day.
One dose ensures transcendence beyond life and death’s plum—
Who, then, is the destined one?

**Viewing Pear Blossoms at Lingxu Abbey**
This wondrous sight, they say, belongs to the martial temple,
As the heavens revolve, we behold it in late spring.
A thousand trees of white brocade, frost congealed as snow,
A single breeze of fragrance breathes forth musk and orchid.

Feathered guests wander, ascending the moonlit pavilion,
Lofty immortals descend, as if from the starry altar.
The abbey’s numinous beauty silently takes form—
Transformed into boundless fragments of scattered jade.

**Former Travels**
The road through Qin’s plains and Wei’s waters was fair,
No need to ask of long pavilions or short.
When clouds part over Western Peak, the Immortal’s Palm gleams white,
When rain passes Southern Mountain, the Buddha’s Crown shines green.

The cinnabar dawn seems to unfurl its morning hues,
Jagged emerald peaks stand like painted screens.
Friends beyond the sea, hearing of my Dao,
Listen with open hearts, ears inclined.

*End of Volume One of the* Panxi Collection
*Volume Two of the* Panxi Collection

**Seven-Character Quatrains by Qiu Chuji, the Ever-Spring Master of Mount Qixia**

**[Ritual Rectification]**
The folk of Guanzhong are simple and sincere,
Many incline toward goodness.
Daoists revere the seventh [month],
Buddhists turn the eighth [wheel].
Each year’s end, they gather in great numbers,
After noon, before the sacred icons, they chant scriptures and repent—
This is called *Ritual Rectification*.
Only when the month concludes does it end.

Snow clears, spring’s light reveals great peace,
Wind gentle, sun warm—all the brighter.
Sing high in assembly, cast off melancholy,
Boil round cakes crisp for *Ritual Rectification*.

**In Reply to Scholar Fan**
Ask not how the threads of fate are woven,
Only cultivate hidden virtue, thoughts ever renewed.
Human sentiments shift like the Dao of immortals—
In daily practice, exert all your strength.

**For Daoist Friend Liu the Second**
This man loves wine and chess.
When merry, he drinks a thousand cups of wine,
In stillness, he plays a game of chess.
White-haired years should serve as a distant mirror,
Red-dust trifles—know them not too well.

**Two Poems Admonishing Qiang of Jingyang**
Su Qin, Lu Jia—all return to emptiness,
Through the ages, the wise wake from one dream.
How much better to forget cunning and seal the lips,
Silently seize the nine-heaven wind!

A hundred years, ten thousand affairs—all a void,
Swift as a fleeting shadow through a crack.
Why do men of the floating world not awaken?
Foolish hearts still grasp at spring’s breeze.

**To Layman Yang the Fifth**
I wished to send a poem, but paper was lacking,
Sifting through scrolls, I found an old letter.
After it, I earnestly inscribed a quatrain,
Urging you: do good, do not hesitate.

**Returning the Paper Fan Bestowed by Yang the Fifth**
Grateful for your gift of white banana-leaf fan,
In mountain valleys, winds rise without summons.
In the city’s scorching days, no cool air comes—
I beg you, hold it and leisurely wave.

**In Reply to Scholar Qiao**
Newly widowed, he seeks to still his heart and enter the Dao.
Beyond the world, his heart returns, cutting off the great demon,
In leisure, he sings even more loftily.
The mind’s terrace now bears few desires,
His sturdy bones will ride the wind in days to come.

**Inscribed on Yang the Fifth’s Paper Fan**
Towering peaks press against the heavens,
Precipitous cliffs, distant mists clinging.
Since ancient times, visitors to Mount Song,
Haughty immortals of Mount Hua.

**Inscribed on Scholar Wang’s Paper Fan**
I love the boundless sky, summer days long,
Who hates the cruel heat, the blazing clouds?
The triple-burner’s toxic heat, years of it, now gone—
One grasp of cool wind brings eternal chill.

**Inscribed on Scholar Qiao’s Paper Fan**
Fiery sun, flying clouds of flame,
Wayfarers on the road bathe in sweat.
In the deep green caves of the mountains, carefree guests
Recline beneath pines, playing chess at ease.

**Inscribed on Wang the Second’s Paper Fan**
After the *Ruibin* [fifth lunar month] heat grows fiercer,
Toxic warmth steams, nowhere to hide.
Only in the emerald caves of Ever-Spring Mountain
Does coolness linger all day, naturally serene.

**Inscribed on Zhou Daoquan’s Paper Fan**
Stream winds sigh like descending frost,
Gully waters ripple like churning snow.
All day, no toil or burden weighs—
When will stifling heat return?

**Inscribed on Madam Pang’s Rattan Fan**
Delicate patterns woven in silver threads,
Gentle breezes scatter jade-like grace.
Though autumn’s gales bring crispness,
For you, it will not be long.

**Chen Family Thatched Hall by the Luo River**
A thatched hall stands high in half the grove’s shade,
Tall trees, uneven, deep green bamboo.
No sound of carriages or horses—fame and profit far,
In quietude all day, the heart finds rest.

**Scholar Duan’s Raft Lost to Rising Waters**
Scholar Duan launched his raft down Western Mountain,
Just as waves surged, sweeping all beyond the pass.
Turning back, he bore no grudge against the River Lord,
Singing high, rejoicing in his light return.

**Flying Immortals**
Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou,
The three isles’ immortals wander as one.
Merged with the nine heavens, no hindrance,
They soar through the eight directions, freely roaming.

**Painting of Zhong and Lü**
No self, no other—nature free,
Master and disciple converse in harmony.
Expounding scriptures, teaching Dharma on the three mountains,
Riding mists, soaring clouds, a thousand miles they roam.

**Two Poems on Dwelling in Mount Jingfu**
Tigers roar in fierce winds, beasts startle,
Demons meet in long nights, sleep’s soul trembles.
When will the simple and upright Dao-heart appear?
The sun of wisdom dawns, the heavenly eye opens.

Jingfu’s depths, worldly affairs few,
Dragon Gate’s tranquility, Tiger Creek’s clarity.
At times, the cry of the red pheasant—*jieguo jiazha*—
Like the creaking of an axle’s lock.

A kind of red pheasant in the mountains
Makes the sound *jieguo jiazha*.
Woodcutters entering the hills
Joke that it is "snow settled."
The descending call turns to *goujia gezhe*—
The partridge’s cry.

**Four Poems Expressing My Aspirations**
I seek the Dao, letting my spirit roam free,
At Dragon Gate, tigers now and then intrude.
On mountain peaks, fierce fires blaze in midwinter,
In ravine depths, yin winds chill the fifth month.

The subtle principle of pure emptiness spans the world,
The great simplicity’s honest breeze fills the age.
The supreme Dao has a name—where is its reality?
The enlightened speak not, yet know and return.

The root of entering the Dao lies in self-commitment,
Who knows the message of transcending the dust?
First, *Nanhua* brings carefree joy,
Finally, the boundless sea meets its vast appointment.

Wild cranes, solitary clouds—my livelihood,
Cool winds, bright moon—my Daoist life.
A thousand mountains, piled high, gather cloud and mist,
The four seas, radiant, gleam with sunlight.

**Four Poems on Yang of Longzhou Bringing Moon Osmanthus to Visit**
Buried in dust, how pitiable,
Following worldly ways for years.
By chance, a noble scholar roams hills and waters,
Meeting lofty immortals, companions of sages.

A lone branch, elegant, leans on cold mountains,
All flowers of the four seas bow in shame.
If it meets a fine wind and auspicious air,
Heavenly fragrance will drift through the world.

From first breath, it received the true essence,
Passing on splendor, linking fragrance like fire.
Among the world’s hundred flowers, none rivals the moon,
Only this can endure through the ages.

Dense trees, high mountains, hidden in the earth,
Many winds, little dew—fearing the cold sky.
One day, it will return to the Moon Palace,
Where the five peaks gather clouds, the four seas gaze.

**Releasing a Hawk**
Let it fly, rivaling Zhi Dun’s crane,
Never cage it like Wang Xizhi’s goose.
Though it matches Zhuangzi’s "crying for justice,"
Beware it learns Mao’s immortal’s love-demons.

**Clear Dream Pavilion in Longzhou Hall**
In Clear Dream Pavilion, pure scholars dwell,
In tranquil leisure, they nurture true suchness.
When true suchness is nurtured, dreams grow clear,
Dreamless, pure joy abounds.

**Reply to Magistrate Xiao of Longzhou’s Summons**

Parting from Long Mountain on business,
I passed through Tingchuan to Shihui Temple,
lingering for days—my resolve yet unformed.
Then your letter arrived, and joyfully I returned.
Soon came word of your honored appointment at the Qianyuan frontier,
and I longed to rest in quietude beneath Longxi’s skies.
The yellow crane scorns a thousand-mile flight,
while white clouds still cling to their old mountain perch.

**Gazing Back at Longmen Mountain from the Road After Returning from Tingchuan**

Southward, Longmen gapes wide in a single cleft,
as the crane-borne immortal turns his head once more.
Deeply I know this place’s weight of karmic ties—
no other land could encompass such virtue and power.

**Reply to the Recluse of Rest-and-Rest, Summoned by Princess Cao**

Mountains and hidden ravines are no mark of loftiness;
I examine my heart and find it clouded, benighted.
Vain fame brings only confusion and entanglement—
better to sit idle, nurturing blindness and deafness.

**Reply to the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, Jiagu Longhu’s Summons**

Just as the Recluse of Rest-and-Rest was about to depart,
the illustrious prince and marquis arrived in turn.
I am ashamed to find no Daoist arts within my heart,
only my outer traces scattered like dust.

**To Master Yunwai’s Disciple Sun Keda, Traveling to the West to Spread the Dao**

In the western lands, many turn toward the Dao,
yet the Daoist’s comings and goings are full of error.
You must tread the rugged path through mountain prefectures,
vigilant lest heterodox demons arise.

**Sent to Magistrate Rong of Fufeng**

When the heart is true, even fish scales grow vast;
why begrudge a horse’s bones their towering height?
If your dwelling holds sincerity, trust will follow—
without wisdom, descending the hall is but empty toil.

**Compassion**

A sick dog, none to brew its porridge;
a freezing donkey, stiff-limbed on the ground.
If one fails to cultivate hidden virtue in life,
how can the turning shell escape calamity?

**Too Late to Act**

**Time’s Flight**

Sun and moon rush past above my head,
light and shadow glide before my eyes.
Turn but once to look back—already old;
even hastening to cultivate, one acts too late.

**Wisdom**

In cultivation, wisdom is paramount,
yet fear it may show only outwardly.
Outer falsehood and inner truth clash—
one side fails as the other succeeds.

**Forsaking Root for Branch**

A single thought of no-arising brings freedom;
a thousand calamities disperse—what cause for grief?
Yet base is the nature of most beings,
who day and night race outward in pursuit.

**Presented to Emperor Shizong**

Ninefold, the Son of Heaven is earth’s noblest;
tenfold, the immortals are beyond form’s revered.
Ask this: which is better—
to guard one corner all day,
or to traverse ten thousand leagues in an instant?

**Reply to Ninghai’s Summons**

Snow blankets the mountains, paths impassable;
heaven bids carriages and horses halt east and west.
Pitiful, the intent of Ninghai’s officials and people—
their gaze fixed on Western Mountain, all in vain.

**On Hearing the Shao Music, Playfully Composed for Lord Yuyang**

Three poles high, the sun sleeps at ease;
ten thousand acres of white clouds idle in pairs.
I only fear that hollow fame may stir the palace halls,
disturbing my high-pillowed rest in the green hills.

**Late Spring Ascent**

Fading blossoms drift like crimson rain;
the setting sun scatters pale rays.
Gazing afar at Western Mountain’s watchtowers,
they stand like a fist raised against the sky.

**Spring’s Chill**

Spring winds on the sea toss daily;
when will spring’s hues grace the mountain peaks?
Pure companions have passed, the Vermilion Bright nears,
yet no crimson blossoms have touched my eyes.

**The Nine-and-Sixty Calamity**

The kalpa’s disasters, heaven’s scourges—none can withstand;
even high immortals and sages find no remedy.
One must endure the full measure of prosperous years’ retribution,
then ascend to peace and enter the Dao’s precincts.

**Fourteen Poems on Gong Mountain**

I composed these verses on the southern slopes of Gong Mountain, my homeland.

Gong Mountain looms, piercing the azure vault;
pine shadows dense, sealing the emerald sky.
Atop its crown, I wear pine blossoms, eat pine seeds,
drink by the pine stream beneath the moon, sipping pine winds.

Pine winds sigh through pine mist,
the sighing mist disperses through the nine heavens.
Beyond the sky, lightly veiling all things,
they mingle with sun and moon in shared revolution.

A thousand-fathom waterfall, bright and graceful;
a single sweep of misty light, majestic in force.
At times, auspicious winds blow it into rain,
a drizzling vastness that scatters into empty space.

Though Qingcheng, Huashan, and Tiantai stand tall,
how can they compare to my mountain’s grandeur?
A cluster of peaks, ten thousand fathoms high—
its majesty truly rivals Penglai.

Gong Mountain’s heights cradle the White Cloud Palace,
the palace pressing upon the mountain’s foremost peak.
Above the peak, white clouds drift ceaselessly,
leisurely coming and going, entwining the green pines.

Mountain hues waver between presence and absence,
half dissolving into dark depths, half into the void.
Vaguely at the sky’s edge, yet nowhere to be found—
ever drifting, ever shrouded in white clouds.

Since ancient times, Gong Mountain has known many white clouds,
layer upon layer forming a canopy into the Great Net.
Immortal hosts appear and vanish unseen,
only the songs of grotto immortals heard amid the clouds.

Ethereal immortal songs enter Gong Mountain,
gradually merging with the Great One’s altar.
Upon the altar, immortals tend their cauldrons,
ever refining the Great Return Elixir.

Striking open the Milky Way to brush the stars,
alone I sit in the Toad Palace, embracing the solar wheel.
By night I herd the sacred tortoise, by dawn I lead the crane;
hungry, I eat pine nuts; cold, I wrap myself in clouds.

Atop the mountain, I kindle a single lamp—
all demons under heaven cease to stir.
Only the steadfast, enlightened adept
walks among the pines, playing with the luminous pearl.

**Spring on Gong Mountain**

Leisurely I send the Azure Dragon to gather moonlight,
together driving the White Tiger to sow the Yellow Sprout.
When the Yellow Sprout is about to burst forth,
thunder shakes the earth—
the Azure Dragon and White Tiger’s fangs jut out.

**Summer on Gong Mountain**

Sunlight spills like fire, clouds congeal;
sea-bottom dragons coil, then ascend.
Gathering the triple summer’s heat from every mountain peak,
they transform it into a single sphere of water.

**Autumn on Gong Mountain**

Clouds surge, rosy hues gleam on heaven’s thoroughfare;
pines dense, mountains high, pressing upon the earth’s map.
At the summit’s sheer pinnacle, none tread—
only the solitary moon shines, radiant and clear.

**Winter on Gong Mountain**

Layered clouds stretch boundless, snow falls thick;
bitter winds howl, scraping the earth with force.
They stir the mountain’s endless scenes—
jade flowers, coral petals fill the sky.

**Twenty Odes on Laishan**

Laishan in Donglai’s Jimo, encircled thrice by the sea,
its back to the plains, colossal stones towering,
peaks soaring—truly a grotto-heaven blessed land,
a realm of surpassing beauty in this corner of the world.

Yet remote at the sea’s edge, few in the world know it,
and its name is not auspicious.
After concluding my rites in Changyang, I arrived at Yongzhen Abbey in Wangcheng.
Gazing south through the mist, I glimpsed it faintly.
The Daoist community urged me to stay, and after several days’ delay, I finally reached it.
Thus I composed these twenty leisurely odes, renaming it Aoshan,
to invigorate the winds of the Dao.

Aoshan rises boldly from the sea’s edge,
its subtle numinous beauty filling heaven’s thoroughfare.
Peaks carved like wax, thousands of fathoms high,
countless jagged rocks piercing the sky.

The Two Ancestral Palaces stand south, guarding the sea—
namely, the Supreme Clarity and Grand Clarity Palaces.
The Three Peaks of Wangming face north, blocking the road—
that is, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey south of the Dao.

Know then that this immortal realm beyond the world
does not deign to be mapped in daylight.

At first, the mountain’s hues wavered between presence and absence;
ten days passed in delay, yet I had not arrived.
A grotto-heaven so near, yet unreachable—
only my poems filled my satchel.

Floating mists, layered greens—this mountain city,
ridges and peaks stacked like painted screens.
Creation set its marker here, eastward resting on the sea,
where clouds unfurl and rosy hues swirl as the sun darkens.

Threefold the sea, one level field—
below it anchors the golden turtle, above it meets the sky.
Day and night, tide winds roll like snow,
and amid deep rosy clouds, flying immortals dwell.

A blessed mountain, a land of fortune, veiling immortals—
ten thousand ravines, a thousand cliffs, sealing the grotto court.
Creation did not place it along the great road,
for it disdains the world’s foul stench.

Laishan is none other than Aoshan,
unclimbable at the sea’s heart.
The Lord on High wished to perfect the Dao’s fruit,
so he moved the immortal traces near to humankind.

Layered ridges, repeated peaks—towering and jagged,
cloud-mountains dazzle the eye, emerald heaped upon emerald.
The path winds three hundred turns around the mountain’s waist—
with each step, the traveler lingers, loath to proceed.

Pines and crags rise steep, auspicious mist drifts light,
grotto-palaces lie deep, their qi and aspect pure.
Strange rocks and jagged peaks—who wrought their change?
From primal creation’s dawn, heaven shaped them so.

With brush and ink I sought to capture their form,
climbing those high ridges, twenty tiers in all.
Southward, vast plains stretch a thousandfold,
each layer of cliff crowned by another peak.

At the fourth watch, the mountain births the moon, still slanting,
I ascend the eastern peak to watch the dawn’s rosy clouds.
Sunlight adorns the sky, bright upon the sea,
golden rays strike the eye, dazzling like blossoms.

Heaven’s Pillar Peak stands towering, solitary,
piercing clouds and mist to enter the azure vault.
I know not when sun, moon, and stars fade,
only that yin and yang’s seasons harmonize.

A grotto bears the fine name White Dragon Grotto—
I know not which age concealed immortal traces.
To this day, through ten thousand ages of human change,
it still nestles ‘gainst the crags, facing ancient pines.

Another grotto holds the immortal name Old Lord’s Grotto—
its spirit clear, its qi fresh, peerless in transcendence.
From on high, I gaze down upon the blue-green sea,
guarding stillness, at ease, facing white clouds.

Master Hua Gai, who attained the Dao in Song Taizu’s time, ascended to the azure heavens,
and from that day, the Dao-mountain’s purity stood eminent.
Even now, beneath sheer cliffs and secluded crags,
immortals still gather to listen to the sea’s tide.

A cultivator, rustic wanderer, no man of letters,
yet upon reaching Aoshan, even I compose verse.
I seek only to behold the grotto-heaven’s sea and sun,
no need for cloud and rain, nor prayers in blue-green script.

White-haired, careworn, yet unfinished as an immortal,
I wander mountains and rivers, lingering in delight.
I do not mind the heavens’ many offices,
only fear the world’s vulgar ties.

Cultivation is like climbing a mountain—arduous,
each step hard-won, each step higher.
If the heart’s resolve does not falter or flag,
one may ascend to heaven and pluck the immortal peaches.

Aoshan’s three sides float upon the sea,
as the sun rises from Fusang, gilding the waves red.
Vast and boundless, azure waves stretch a thousand leagues,
all turned to gold, suffusing the mountain’s east.

Mountains and rivers belong to the Dao’s livelihood,
the ten thousand forms, all one family.
Were it not for sages’ hidden governance,
how could heaven and earth long endure their splendor?

I sigh at creation’s majestic work,
mountains, rivers, and earth stand in empty space.
How much fills the eight wastes and four seas?
All rests within the one qi of Primordial Harmony.

**Twenty Poems Revisiting Laishan**
*Composed in the year Da’an Jisi, after the Jiao rites in Jiaoxi, when Daoist companions invited me to revisit Aoshan, and I again inscribed twenty poems.*

**Ten Poems at Shangqing Palace**
Returning from the rites, I sought the Dao-mountain,
deep in the wilds, where the sea’s bays encircle.
Boarding a boat, I turned toward the waves,
and there, amid misty vapors, Penglai took form.

Peaks rise sheer, overhanging the abyss,
their lofty summits lean against the sky.
The blue-green sea, ancient and everlasting, swallows sun and moon,
while the azure mountains, morning and evening, birth clouds and mist.

Green mountains are the Daoist’s true home,
and here, this immortal mountain nears the sea’s edge.
The sea vast, the mountain high—no filth or foulness,
clouds deep, the land secluded—all the more refined.

Strange rocks, hollowed by time, shaped by nature,
a thousand marvels, ten thousand forms—beyond naming.
Sheer cliffs, unvisited by men,
yet day and night, strains of immortal music drift.

At dawn, the sun veiled, clouds begin to rise,
the mountain’s hues somber, not yet fully revealed.
One must climb higher to see from the peak—
as if riding heaven’s winds, leaving the dust behind.

Massive boulders stand in ranks upon the ridge,
the summit’s perilous heights—no path remains.
In late autumn, waters freeze, layered ice congeals,
in the ninth month of summer, clouds chill, peaks shrouded in haze.

Viewing the mountain from the sea, its grandeur shifts,
its purity and loftiness jut into empty space.
From dawn to dusk, boulders birth clouds,
all transformations wrought by creation’s hand.

In the west, renowned mountains like Huayue are rare,
in the south, wonders like Jiuhua stand alone.
Aoshan cradles the Eastern Ocean,
its beauty surpassing all in Shandong—yet unknown.

Peaks upon peaks, overlapping, concealing,
clustered, thronging, vying in splendor.
The eye finds cool clarity, the heart’s ground is refreshed—
since ancient times, immortal mountains have been the finest livelihood.

I have wandered the Five Peaks, journeyed the Four Sacred Mountains,
yet no range can compare.
Only because it lies at the sea’s edge, the sky’s rim,
has its lofty name not resounded through the Nine Provinces.

**Ten Poems at Taiqing Palace**
Leaving Shangqing Palace, mist and haze part,
the dawn’s light faint, the path barely discernible.
Arriving below, before men have eaten,
I sit and behold the mountain and sea—a vast expanse.

Clouds and mist dim, rain falls in fine drops,
the stone grotto detains me, will not let me go.
Perhaps the grotto-heaven takes pity,
lamenting how rarely I come.

The cloud-sea stretches boundless, no shore in sight,
only the tide’s crest, waves churning like blossoms.
High peaks, a thousand folds, linked in cloud-borne beauty,
one cluster forms a screen—this is the Daoist’s home.

Pine winds, stream waters—both pure and secluded,
their clear sounds fill the day, cease not even at night.
Wild cranes come and go, never weary,
while idle visitors wish to depart, yet are urged to stay.

The stream runs deep, stones lie vast, pines grow thick,
lush and verdant, the Dao’s qi harmonious.
Were it not for years of woodcutters’ toil,
floating clouds would veil the sun, filling the crags’ recesses.

A name renowned through the ages, soaring with the clouds,
the mountain-wandering scholar stands apart.
Immortal lords, noble as the Three Mao Masters,
official clans, honored as the Ten Thousand Stone House.

Gazing west, the mountain pierces the sky,
where immortals’ homes cultivate the azure peach.
How many times has the peach ripened, while men change worlds?
In the grotto, Qin’s maidens grow fur upon their bodies.

Clear songs, delicate as the void’s steps, rise in unison,
beneath the moon, high chants, phoenix dances dip low.
Their laughter and talk touch not the floating world’s affairs,
together they pass straight beyond the Ninth Heaven’s west.

Purple and emerald mists, white clouds soaring high,
in grotto-palaces, immortals feast on jade peaches.
Drums echo through the azure cliffs, thunder shakes in fright,
and all the mountain’s birds and beasts cry out in chorus.

The Dao’s power, divine work—beyond words,
alone it transcends, shaping the ten thousand transformations.
Mountains and seas know their weight,
while the bottomless void floats for ten thousand years.

**Fifteen Poems on the Mid-Autumn Festival**
*Composed on the tenth day of the eighth month, returning from Changle County to the Yuqing Abbey north of Weizhou city.*

From the western county, eastward to Yuqing,
the golden wind sweeps the evening sky clear.
I open my heart to welcome the Mid-Autumn moon,
only fearing clouds may dim its brightness at the hour.

The western wind stirs through the ten thousand trees of the Nine Provinces,
the cold light of night flows westward in a single stream.
The air beyond the dust cleanses to the bone,
and everywhere, songs and joy refuse to let one linger.

At first parting the sea’s ridges, a lingering clarity remains,
the hearts of ten thousand lands rejoice in grand peace.
May the precious radiance know no wax nor wane,
and heaven’s essence never suffer gain or loss.

Like unrefined gold and jade upon the celestial thoroughfare,
embracing snow and congealing frost, it illumines the great void.
The four seas and hundred rivers all reflect its light,
while the myriad beings and forms dwell in tranquility.

A single expanse of pure light unfurls for ten thousand miles,
no distinction between thatched huts and towering halls.
Every household delights in leisurely verse and admiration,
while a fresh breeze lends its aid to joy unbounded.

A traveler lingers, gazing toward the vast heavens,
raising a cup, intent on savoring the moon’s glow.
Yet the moon’s light knows not how to detain the heart,
faintly drifting through the azure sky, serene and self-contained.

Golden waves never rest day or night,
their gentle, clear radiance emerging from sea and mountain.
The pale orb ascends, wandering beyond all things,
its gracious light descending to bathe the human realm.

The azure firmament’s majesty has its appointed time,
heaven’s light shines impartially by nature.
Yet I fear the lower world’s heavy darkness of delusion,
obscuring the moment when the golden wheel appears.

Round and bright, the moon hangs in the empty sky,
even a hundred-fold refined bronze mirror cannot compare.
In every body of water, its reflection appears,
dissolving the gall of all demons, leaving none untouched.

The hazy shadow of the osmanthus drifts down to illuminate mortals,
spanning the ages, its cause unknown.
When shall I ride a crane to the clouds above,
and gaze down upon the azure heavens and the white jade wheel?

Clouds come and go without pause,
dawn and dusk shift between clarity and gloom.
Tonight, fortunate to behold this beauty,
I compose new verses to express the Dao’s sentiment.

Year after year at this time, lives are taken in great number,
heaven-piercing karma arises—what can be done?
Yet thanks to our sovereign’s strict prohibition,
all beings’ lives find peace and harmony.

The sagely ruler ascends the throne, and all things are at rest,
a benevolent wind curbs killing, beginning at court.
Lords and commoners alike cultivate virtue,
that the moon’s radiance may shine upon all.

In the stillness of night, dark clouds arise,
none among the living share in heaven’s true joy.
Yet it is only the clouds that veil the eyes in the sky—
beyond the heavens, the moon has never shunned mortals.

A hundred years of time pass in an instant,
how many Mid-Autumns bring a moment of leisure?
Better to refine one’s nature like the autumn moon,
its clarity and brightness bringing ease to body and mind.

*End of Volume Two of the Panzhou Collection*
*Panxi Collection, Volume Three*

**Songs and Hymns by Qiu Chuji, the Ever-Spring Master of Mount Xi**

**[Song of the Azure Heavens]**
Azure heavens, let no drifting clouds arise,
for clouds that rise obscure the myriad forms.
The myriad forms arrayed repel a hundred evils—
when light fails to shine, demon-kings prevail.

At first, I swept the skies and earth to clarity,
a thousand gates and ten thousand doors sang of great peace.
Yet sometimes a single black cloud would rise,
and the nine apertures and hundred bones knew no peace.

Thus I ever kindle the fierce wind of wisdom,
sweeping through the Three Realms and Ten Directions.
When clouds disperse, the void’s true body appears,
and naturally, the moon shines in every home.

Beneath the moon, one may play the flute,
a single resonant note subduing Hua and Yi.
Startled, the Jade Lad of the East rides forth,
astride a white deer, swift as a shooting star.

Presently, another melody arises—
neither sheng nor horn, yet of a kind.
A three-foot cloud-zither with twelve studs,
carved through kalpas by the Primal One.

Jade-like tones, pure and clear, surpassing Zheng’s music,
light and penetrating, reaching the hearts of the enlightened.
Since I attained this, ghosts and spirits lend aid,
ascending to heaven, descending to earth, transcending past and present.

Unfettered, unbound, my heart seeks no glory,
my body knows no disgrace.
At leisure, I sing the *White Snow* within the gourd,
in stillness, I tune the *Yangchun* beyond the world.

This music of mine arises naturally—
pipes without holes, zithers without strings.
Awakened from the dream of floating life,
day and night, pure sounds fill the cavern-heaven.

**[Six Hymns]**

**Hymn of the Primordial**
In the quiet of an empty mountain’s night, faint clouds form,
a pale moon, sparse stars, and the cold qi intermingle.
Suddenly, the Long Star gleams in the great void;
turning, I see the Northern Dipper hidden in the vast expanse.

Heaven and earth shift from gloom to brightness in an instant,
the cosmos in turmoil—what does it rely upon?
There must be a mechanism, silently moving,
revolving in emptiness, reciprocating endlessly.

Great indeed is the boundless, mysterious Dao of the Primordial,
what does it not nurture with its numinous efficacy?
It transforms the Three Luminaries, turning the skies azure,
nourishing the myriad things, unfolding their blossoms and calyxes.

Soaring through past and present, it never decays,
enduring peril and hardship, yet never weakened.
The vast torrent surges and swells of its own,
who measures the great transformations?

The Primal Qi first stirs change,
the Supreme Honored One alone transcends all.
Trampling the void, emerging from the unfathomable,
splitting open chaos, giving birth to radiance.

Yin and yang ascend and descend, forming gates,
the sun and moon traverse, serving as locks and keys.
Heat departs, cold arrives; day and night divide,
times flow and ebb, prosperity and decline take their turns.

Above, the pivot of heaven and earth is established,
below, the bell of guidance resounds.
Virtue is built according to place, things are measured by need,
teachings are set forth in accord with the times, following human joy.

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors all revere it as their ancestor,
the Six Paths and Four Births all submit in assent.
Even the sagely literary talent of Confucius began in ignorance—
how vast the Dao and virtue of the Hidden Dragon!

**Hymn of Deliverance**
Deep in the mountains, the path is secluded, few travelers pass,
all day in the quiet crags, I listen to the birds’ cries.
No guests to accompany me beneath the bright moon,
sometimes I stand alone above the azure clouds.

Above the clouds, my solitary chant drives a hundred evils far,
gazing to the horizon, the mountains shrink to naught.
The tune soars, the wind swift, the melody lingering,
pure and transcendent, my steps ethereal, my spirit untethered.

I recall the days when Chongyang roamed the corners of the earth,
his pure chant yearning to restore heaven and earth’s simplicity.
He cast his line in Fufeng, unknown to all,
measuring the great sea, I alone foresaw.

His divine subtlety defies distinction,
his transcendent discourse is not what the world studies.
Looking back today, the Dao stands lofty,
only now do I grasp the towering merit of those years.

First, in Dongmou, he expounded benevolence and filial piety,
yet could not transform the customs, lifting the veil.
Five assemblies arose, each with its name:
in Ninghai, the Golden Lotus; in Dengzhou, the Jade Splendor;
in Laizhou, the Level Equality; in Wendeng, the Seven Treasures;
in Fushan, the Three Lights.

In three prefectures, the three teachings flourished,
households entered trance, spirits descended in dreams, people were astounded.
Discarding caps and crowns, I weighed my course.
The Master dwelt by the Eastern Sea, a hidden dragon;
Ma entered the Western Qin, transforming into a leopard.

Danyang’s propagation of the Dao thrived in Shaanxi.
In the summer of the *jichou* year of the Dading era,
I and several others, including Danyang,
followed Master Chongyang from Wendeng to Ninghai.
The season turned to Dragon Spring, the sun’s heat grew intense.

The Master bade us go ahead while he held the umbrella behind,
some half a *li* distant.
Suddenly, I turned and saw the umbrella soar into the sky.
I hurried back to ask, and he said:
“It was borne aloft by the whirlwind, I know not how.”

At first, the umbrella rose to the northeast,
floating gently, then fell among the sands.
We searched in the direction he pointed, but found nothing.
At that time, my Dharma kin, Huiyangzi Wang,
was secluded on Zha Mountain by the Eastern Sea’s edge.

The mountain lay one hundred and ten *li* from Wendeng,
and Wendeng was seventy *li* from where the umbrella rose.
The umbrella ascended at the *chen* hour,
and by dusk, it fell into the handle of Huiyang’s hut.

Huiyang was his Daoist name,
bestowed by the Master—a character not found in the *Pian Yun*.
The umbrella was later kept by the Zhai family below Zha Mountain,
borrowed from Fan Mingshu of Ninghai.
When Fan later learned of this and sought to reclaim it, they refused.

As for my discarding of the cap:
When the Master first climbed the northern city to view the sea,
his bamboo-skin cap suddenly fell into the water and drifted away,
only to return later.
*Qian* is pronounced like *zhu*.

**Hymn of Carefree Wandering**
The Ten Isles and Three Mountains in the vast sea,
crimson towers and jade pavilions, soaring unevenly into the void.
Pine shadows densely veil, fearing no scorching sun,
silken fans still, yet a pure breeze arises.

Molten gold’s heat—
the jade-belted immortals never speak of it.
Crystal palaces open,
jeweled thrones arrayed with stars.

The azure void suspends images around the towers,
the pure and transformed body is not of flesh and blood.
This original body,
naturally attuned to the divine,
in laughter and speech, suddenly startles the immortals of heaven.

**Hymn of Ease**
Jade terraces and Penglai gardens in the azure vault,
auspicious clouds and blessed qi, brimming and filling the sky.
Immortals appear and vanish, scattering pure rain,
the myriad transformations unfold, stirring fragrant winds.

The scorching heat—
where is there a household that has not spoken of it?
Mists withdraw, grotto-heavens open,
gates stand aligned with the Milky Way.

From time to time, the Nine Heavens host illustrious guests,
a thousand *li* away, no need to ride a sweating steed.

Beyond the mundane, the body—
naturally pure in spirit—
who would envy those who climb towers, fanning themselves?

**Ode Gazing at the Sea**
I have observed the grandeur of the world’s terrain,
and east of Tong Pass, north of the Huai River,
none surpasses Dengzhou.
Thus I compose *Ode Gazing at the Sea* to record its truth.

Penglai lies secluded in the eastern corner,
its grandeur unmatched beneath heaven.
The land borders the realm of immortals and sages,
the mountains rest upon the dens of fish and dragons.
From on high, I gaze toward Xihe,
my vision stretching yet never reaching its end.
Vast and boundless, sky and sea merge,
billowing clouds and mist spill forth.
Long winds stir the waves,
a thousand *li* of frosty snow surging.
Ascending the isles, I stand in lofty dominion,
the earth’s mounds lost in the vast expanse.
At times, the numinous *qi* harmonizes,
transformations beyond the ordinary unfold.
Myriad scenes array in boundless splendor,
too wondrous to describe.

Great indeed is the lord of a hundred rivers,
deep and clear, its depths unfathomable.
With the tides, it keeps its faithful rhythm,
through the ages, it never runs dry in drought.
Beside it, the ponds of mortal fields,
scattered far and wide, lie open.
Compared to its leviathan waves,
they are but frogs in a well—pitifully small.

Gazing across the level expanse, no shore in sight,
it stretches boundless, majestic and pure.
No tributary muddies its waters,
through ten thousand ages, it transcends birth and decay.

**Ode of Immortal Wandering**
Beyond the red dust of the mortal world,
between the jade terraces and azure heavens,
immortals in the grottoes never age,
wanderers beyond the clouds remain ever at ease.
The crimson phoenix sings from its cavernous nest,
the red hound barks by the alchemical railing.
A maiden in blue delivers the imperial decree,
a white crane returns bearing a letter.

Feasting at the banquet of the Jasper Grove,
poems are composed by the feathered guests.
In the Golden Mother’s palace, songs resound,
on Jade Turtle Mountain, long whistles echo.
Fruits ripen once in three thousand years,
the tower spirals twelvefold in ascent.
When will King Mu arrive?
When will Dongfang Shuo climb?
The Lady of Guye’s skin remains pure,
He Xiangu’s beauty ever radiant.
Feiqiong plunges into the moon’s cavern,
Nongyu adorns her hair with blossoms.
They command their chariots to roam the Three Isles,
riding the winds past a hundred barbarian lands.
They circle the seas and mountains,
leaping to ascend the gates of heaven.
Boundless and empty, without limit,
their soaring spirits never wane.

Transcendent, they surpass the dharma-realm,
no longer yearning for the mortal world.

**Three Hymns in Praise of the Dao**

The former worthies and later sages differ not,
divergent schools share one source—transforming delusion.
The Supreme Unity’s chaos opens the door and window,
mysterious truth points straight to heaven’s ladder.

**Dispelling Delusion**
The words of others must not be heeded,
only one’s own heart may be rectified.
If swayed by others’ right and wrong,
one’s own merit and inner nature are undone.

**Admonition to the Multitude: Curb Desire**
Of life’s myriad toils,
none exceeds desire.
It not only severs the root of life,
but also consumes hidden virtue.
To curb this one thing
surpasses all other restraints.
Those who yearn for the Dao and cultivate immortality
have ever held this as their standard.

**Two "Steps in Emptiness" Hymns**
Vast and boundless, the teaching of true cultivation,
billowing forth from the gate of the world-transcending.
The former masters opened the door and window,
the returning steeds shook heaven and earth.
A humble chamber, a secluded immortal abode,
yet its lofty name resounded at the imperial gate.
Cloud companions and rosy-hued friends gather,
paying homage to the honored one of the Great Void.
Precious incense forms cloud-script,
brilliant lamps cluster like nocturnal radiance.
The starry river first gleams,
bells and chimes suddenly resonate.
The master of the rite upholds the auspicious gathering,
with reverent heart praying to the heavens above.
The various immortals deign to glance,
receiving and guiding from the august Sovereign of Emptiness.

**A Lament for Emperor Shizong, with Preface**
In the spring of the wuyin year of the Dading era [1218], your servant Chji was summoned from Mount Zhongnan to the capital. There, he was bestowed with cap, sash, and robe, and awaited imperial command at the Temple of Eternal Longevity. Eleven days later, an edict appointed Chji as High Ritual Master to preside over the rites of the Wanchun Festival. On the first day of the fourth lunar month, he was moved to the official hermitage north of the city. Two days later, on jisi, by imperial decree, statues of the Three Masters—Chunyang, Chongyang, and Danyang—were sculpted for the hermitage, their adornments and offerings meticulously prepared.

On the eighteenth day of the fifth month, he was summoned to Evergreen Isle. In autumn, on the tenth day of the seventh month, he was again received in audience. There, he expounded the principles of heaven and humanity, much to the emperor’s satisfaction. As dusk fell, he took his leave. The following day, an imperial messenger presented a tray of peaches. Though Chji had abstained from tea and fruit for over a decade, he partook of one in gratitude for the imperial favor.

At the Mid-Autumn Festival, by imperial decree on another matter, he was permitted to return to the mountains, with an additional gift of one hundred thousand coins. He respectfully declined the latter.

In the spring of the *jiyou* year, as he passed through Shanzhou, he suddenly received the sorrowful imperial edict. At that time, the world was in turmoil, the sky and earth dimmed in pallor; officials and commoners alike donned mourning white. Though Qiu Chuji had cultivated the Dao beyond the worldly realm, dwelling still within the mortal sphere, how could he not be moved by the weight of imperial grace? He respectfully composed an elegy to express his sincerity:

*The sorrowful edict descended from heaven,
A mournful wind reached Shanzhou.
The Yellow River churned with frost and snow,
The sun veiled in dust and grime.
I recalled the twilight of Evergreen Isle,
Where imperial favor twice renewed my years.
A golden tray bore peaches for my partaking—
Such profound virtue now deepens my sorrow.*

**Fifteen Poems on Swift Cultivation**

Day after day, day upon day,
The fleeting light races like lightning.
Heaven endures, earth persists, grinding through ages,
Spring departs, autumn arrives, the seasons shift.
The great dream drifts, day and night indistinguishable,
Floating life flickers, toiling or at ease.
Human attachments cling even to emptiness,
My aspirations soar, yet fear of loss remains.
The deluded soul wanders like one cast aside,
The heart, craving desires, clings to sweetness like honey.
How can one forget honey’s sweetness?
The pit of ignorance—when will one emerge?
Emergence demands lofty conduct,
Cultivation of the pure tone brooks no false arts.
Only by dissolving self and other, near and far,
Can gods and demons be powerless over fortune or misfortune.
My Dao-nature still blind,
I dwell in a humble hut with purple doors, content in cramped space.
Harmonizing light with dust, I follow the world’s right and wrong,
Responding to sounds without contention.

**Seeking a Patched Robe**
In the eighth month, he sent someone to the county to seek a tattered cloth sleeve-robe from Western Guo.

*White dew wanes, cold dew gleams,
Mountain homes grow desolate, wanderers cease.
Yellow leaves fall from a thousand trees,
My hempen robe stitched with a hundred patches.
Old cloth, weary from the seven-li market to the city,
The patched robe awaits winter’s snow.
Let the city’s wealthy show their kindness,
That I may long dwell in seclusion by Pan Stream.*

**Pine of Long Mountain**
For six years I dwelt on Western Mountain,
Where atop its western slope stood a solitary pine.
Morning clouds, misty, brushed the passes,
Evening rains, pattering, merged with the cavern-heavens.
Heaven shaped this place as my companion,
Across the ravine, we kept distant company.
Lush and verdant, its qi and hue sublime,
Soughing and rustling, the wind’s voice resounded.
Intertwined branches cast layered shade,
Its mandate endured a thousand years deep.
Yet in this year’s early spring,
It suddenly fell to the woodcutter’s axe.
The axe’s *ding-ding* echoed through valleys,
The pine’s smoke, mournful, darkened the mountain’s foot.
I knew then heaven’s intent: I would soon depart,
Thus sent the sacred crag to fall before me.
By the numinous Xia Yu Temple—
Scenes fade, people scatter, what remains to recount?
The empty mountain dims, grieving the traveler.
White cranes soar, losing their path,
The azure dragon lies prone, devoid of spirit.
I know all phenomena are ultimately impermanent,
All forms bound by fate.
Singing beyond the worldly, I return—
The greater hermitage in the dust deepens my awakening.

**To Tangkuo Gu of Weiyang**
She was the younger sister of a former prime

Here the rain pours axle-deep before the hour of *shen*,
A thousand peaks grow dim, the four wilds thunder.
The flat earth swells three feet,
The great river swallows five watches of the night.
Dragons surge from ponds and marshes,
Drought demons fill ditches and gullies.
What remains of the Milky Way?
From this day the celestial thoroughfare stands open.

**Inscribed on the Zhaungzi Scroll in the Collection of Commissioner Liu**
Illustrious Zong loved the Dao in his prime,
His hand traced the ancient forms of the *Nanhua*.
A thousand years have passed since the *Nanhua* departed—
What might its manner and spirit have been?
Only that men today revere the ancient Way,
And in faint imitation drape its aura over their robes.
The perfected one’s breast originally held no waiting,
Ten thousand pores breathe freely with heaven’s wind.
Yang, Han, Ji, Ruan—each heart differed,
Yet all returned to the great clod.

**A Winter Stroll Beyond the Suburbs**
Grasses and trees withered,
Ice and frost bitterly cold.
The long sky—birds flown to the last,
The great sea—fish vanished without trace.
Merchants’ boats lie idle,
All insects sealed in their burrows.
Who beyond abundance
Can loosen the grip of lonely poverty?

**Autumn Wind on the Sea**
A wanderer from Penglai has no home,
His body vows to learn immortality and roam the great expanse.
The great expanse—floodwaters drown the sky’s vastness,
Eastward ten thousand miles stretch blue and boundless.
At dawn, rain passed and the west wind rose sharp;
Staff in hand, I climbed high to breathe the air.
Wild geese fill the sky, peeling jujubes in the clear weather,
Fish and dragons sport in the waves as boats ply the currents.
A thousand feet of silk line drop straight down,
In the jade depths angling for the whale’s bridle.
Yet fish and turtles scatter, refusing the bait,
Grappling with the waves, lost in vain.
My sail cannot yet cross to the far shore,
Again I would ride the raft to float the River of Stars.
The River of Stars looms high, all phenomena bright,
But which white cloud is the companion of long life?

**On the Construction of the Huanglu Jiao at the Xiuzhen Abbey in Dengzhou**
The primal Dao, chaotic and urgent as an arrow,
Yin and yang in ceaseless strife.
The Great Ultimate, vast and dim, opened creation,
From the void, numinous marvels appeared.
All beings, myriad forms, emerged unevenly,
The six directions and eight winds adorned everywhere.
Spanning past and present, ever renewed with the sun,
Flowing forms return to simplicity, changing with the times.
Sentient and insentient cannot be exhausted,
Great wisdom and small wisdom locked in struggle.
Had sages and worthies not opened teachings,
Who would know that movement and stillness are fundamentally empty?
A thousand scriptures, ten thousand treatises offer expedient means,
Precious registers and jade cases inspire all goodness.
From ancient roots in the unseen,
To this day, the Dao and virtue still shine.
Of late, the world’s teachings flourish,
The enlightened transform beings wherever they go.
I too have wandered thirty years,
Returning home to this city by the sea.
South of the city, the towering Xiuzhen Abbey
Stands pure and lofty, touching the River of Stars.
Below, the vast and deep Bohai,
Above, the brilliant stars and constellations.
Within the city, devotees come and go,
Beyond the world, friends share harmonious spirit.
In the tenth month of winter, the fourth year of Cheng’an,
A grand Huanglu rite unfolds the golden code.
Crimson script and jade characters predate heaven,
White talismans and true seals long break evil.
Three-tiered jade altars reflect precious light,
Nine cups of divine lamps scatter stars.
Crags shatter the money of Fengdu Mountain,
Peaks rise in ranks—immortals’ ascent beyond reach.
For four nights, incense and offerings arrayed in solemnity,
For nine mornings, the steps of emptiness echo in circles.
A thousand gates and ten thousand doors brim with joy,
The six streets and three markets all adorned.
Gold flowers and silver candles gleam in radiance,
Inner and outer light pierce through.
Suddenly from the void, auspicious signs appear,
A desolate wheel turns—something extraordinary.
The Jade Emperor proclaims a great amnesty,
Immortal youths ride cranes down to Nanchang.
Lost souls and lingering spirits all ascend,
White-haired elders and yellow-haired children all admire.
Such fine deeds are unheard of at the world’s edge,
Outshining all in Shandong and Hebei.

**The New Abbey North of Weizhou City**
Tranquility need not lie in reclusive suffering,
Where the heart is dust-free, all places suit.
North of the lush prefectural city,
Land rich with flowers and trees, scenes full of wonder.
Once, carriages and horses clamored in vain,
Now transformed into the Jade Purity Abbey.
Who plays within the abbey?
All under heaven who come and go—free wanderers.
Ponds and pavilions lie quiet, veiled in mist and rosy clouds,
The great treasure lotus blooms a ten-zhang flower.
I ask: who is the benefactor of this enterprise?
The ennobled Qianhu, Lord Tai of the great household.

**Inscribed at the Yuntun Abbey on Mount Yuntun in Zhaoyuan County, Laizhou**
On Mount Yuntun, clouds shroud in darkness,
Heavenly winds sway, flying rain scatters.
Numinous and strange, beyond all measure,
A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations—no constant form.
Clouds withdraw, rain clears, no trace remains,
Only rows of mountains arrayed like emerald screens.
How high the peaks, how deep the valleys—what more is there?
White stones piled, pine smoke green.
Spring’s exuberance fills the valleys,
Straight ascent seems to reach heaven’s court.
Heart empty, gaze far, the sky vast and serene,
Looking down, the indistinct encircles the blue-green sea.
Once, the hermitage here spanned three prefectures,
Dengzhou, Laizhou, Ninghai—many came to pay homage.
Now it is a grotto-heaven, all spirits come to court.
The old foundation in the void becomes a new abbey—
People call the old site “the Void,”
An eternal legacy inscribed in fine verse.

**Three Five-Character Short Poems: Admonitions to the World**

**Five Long Five-Character Poems: Teachings for the Assembly**

---

**I. Admonitions to the World**

Powder and rouge, jewels and treasures—
flourishing splendor, vain and fevered chaos.
To know all things are empty,
one must view them through a century’s gaze.

**Climbing the Northern Mountains of Jiaoshui**
Ascending high to gaze upon the Southern Sea,
the eye strains—heaven’s vault, vast and blue.
At the sky’s edge, white clouds arise,
soaring aloft into boundless void.
When clouds disperse, the Eastern Sea’s moon gleams clear,
the Western Mountains’ snow gleams bright.
As the dying night suddenly congeals,
how radiant the pure light!

**II. The Nature of Existence**

Thoughts chase boundless desires,
how many ten thousand kalpas in samsara?
The Five Phases shift with change,
the Four Elements lack firm foundation.
Life is but a fleeting convergence of causes,
vainly toiling through the years in greed.
Not knowing the body itself is affliction,
they futilely vie for things as lofty.
In affairs, though capable,
in self, utterly lacking discipline.
The Six Dusts flutter ceaselessly,
the Three Realms rush in clamor.
Dazzled, the eyes grow weary,
greed presses upon the greying hair.
The heart carved out, lacking courage,
clinging to beauty, slick with fat.
Hair white as snow,
complexion no longer peach-like.
Unable to follow the teachings,
still they gallop in violence and pride.
Swift as the cloud-piercing magpie,
mad as the wall-clinging gibbon.
At times, cunning arises,
in idleness, waves stir.
Sins pile like mountains,
the spirit erodes like the sea’s tides.
No way to companion the pines and cypress,
only to await burial in the weeds.

---

**III. Expressions from the Sea**

On the sea, the wind is crisp and cold,
the sky’s root and water stretch into the distant.
Though icebergs sever,
the summer’s heat naturally fades.
Lofty aspirations span noble integrity,
an empty heart accords with the great Dao.
Parting clouds to roam the boundless,
plying the oars to drift on the azure waves.
Standing alone, enlightening the ages,
circling to survey the eight wilds.
Heaven’s stars do not fall,
earth’s veins stretch without end.
Illusions spew forth a thousand points,
floating life is but a dream’s scene.
The spirit transforms at hand’s turn,
flowers and trees briefly flourish.
A century’s span is short,
the road to the Three Mountains long.
Seeking immortality, lamenting Han Wu,
losing the Dao, sighing for Qin Huang.
The herb-gathering lad has aged,
the raft-riding traveler remains unknown.
Only the traces of the Three Isles remain,
at times revealing auspicious signs.
Great Bamboo Mountain, Little Bamboo Mountain, and Oxcart Isle—
these are the Three Isles.
Auspicious signs—these are the mirages of the sea.

---

**IV. Autumn Day on Mount Ai**

Autumn winds sweep the mountains,
dawn’s sun drives the clouds and mist.
Tender chrysanthemums carpet the earth in yellow,
bright rosy clouds adorn the sky in emerald.
Ascending, thoughts turn to the sea’s peaks,
playing, drawing from the mountain springs.
Massive stones, though perilous, stand firm,
cold pines, aged, grow ever sturdier.
Rock flowers exude fragrant perfume,
ravine grasses stretch in lush green.
Secluded, I wander the hidden Dao,
an empty heart—no sitting in meditation.
Observing emptiness, though free,
encountering scenes, I linger.
Wielding the brush beyond the red dust,
my name soars near the Purple Court.
Still ashamed of the Queen Mother’s secret,
how dare I claim the Jade Emperor’s decree?
Abiding in the world, surpassing the Three Joys,
at peace with the times, outstripping the Seven Sages.
Hiding my light, I return to simplicity,
responding to things, I follow conditions.
The butterfly’s dream startles the ages,
spiritual wandering awaits a hundred years.
Each person may yet encounter this,
mouth to mouth, it is passed on.

---

**V. Pear Blossoms at the Martial Abbey**

The White Emperor departs the golden gates,
the Azure Dragon descends to the jade capital.
Earth spirits unveil their wondrous secrets,
heaven’s essence bestows pure brilliance.
Color suffuses the silver toad’s charm,
fragrance drifts through the jeweled hall’s clarity.
Trees number in the thousands, uneven,
their brightness gleams in the second or third watch.
Flamboyant apricots pale in comparison,
bewitching peaches bow in humility.
Plum blossoms have already hidden,
willow catkins dare not slight them.
Best when the warm breeze caresses,
finest when the fair sun shines.
Travelers anticipate carefree roaming,
feathered adepts celebrate peace.
No dust is permitted to stain,
only nurtured by rain and dew’s glory.
West of the city, old traces remain,
north of the mountains, new fame resounds.
Brilliant orioles flit in joy,
spreading magpies startle in flight.
Jade halls face the doors and windows,
mushroom chambers adjoin the eaves and pillars.
Graceful as Mount Gu’s elegance,
ethereal as Mount Hua’s essence.
Soon the year’s harvest will ripen,
the Dharma Bridge’s completion will universally aid.

---

**Climbing the Mountain of the Daoist Valley**

Gentle and warm, the spring breeze,
languid and mild, the morning sun.
Donning cold robes, I ascend the winding path,
at the summit, I marvel at the secluded wonders.
The Northern Sea’s waves surge vast,
the Southern Mountains’ marshes loom perilous.
East winds carry the blue-black bird down,
western ridges trail white clouds.
The eye’s reach spans the empty vastness,
misty light drifts in the distance.
How untrammeled the spirit,
the Dao and virtue naturally uphold.
Dimly discerned beyond the cinnabar clouds,
uneven at the azure Han’s edge.
No need to gather the magic fungus,
I proceed directly to the immortals’ appointed time.

*Scroll Four of the Panxi Collection*

**Five-Character Regulated Verse on the Withered Catalpa in Madam Zhan’s Courtyard**
*Composed by Qiu Chuji, the Long Spring Daoist of Mount Qixia*

**Preface:**
South of Liaocheng, in the household of the Zou clan, there lived a woman named Madam Zhan, originally from Penglai. From birth, she possessed a nimble mind, deftly weaving silk threads into birds, fish, insects, flowers, and grasses—each form taking shape without need of pattern, flowing effortlessly from her hands. Her craftsmanship surpassed that of the living by far.

After her husband’s death in middle age, she remained a widow, her devotion to the Dao profound. She built a hermitage and set out offerings to welcome the cloud-and-mist companions of the four directions, a practice she maintained for many years. Yet before long, frivolous tongues wove slanderous whispers, tarnishing her steadfast integrity like pine and bamboo besmirched by mud.

Realizing the futility of clearing her name, she gathered her kin and, pointing to the withered catalpa in the courtyard, made this vow before the immortals: *"If my conduct bears not the slightest fault, let this tree revive in glory. Should I prove false, I shall bear the shame alone and swear never to share the same sky and sun as you."* Months passed after her prayer, yet the tree showed no sign of life.

The villagers mocked her, jeering: *"If this tree blooms again, not only will your virtue be proven, but we too shall grow rich and noble!"* Madam Zhan heard their words as if in a spring dream.

That catalpa had been planted in the *gengzi* year of the Dading era (1180). No sooner had it taken root than it withered, battered by wind and rain for nearly five years until its form decayed beyond hope of revival. Yet in the summer of the following *jisi* year (1199)—the very month of Madam Zhan’s prayer—suddenly, a miraculous sprout emerged from the dead wood. Crimson as sacred grass, it stretched forth branches and lush leaves day by day, until its foliage shaded the courtyard steps.

I first heard this tale while in Shaanxi, though I did not witness it myself. By the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), as I passed through this prefecture, the streets and lanes still resounded with its praise.

Upon lodging in Madam Zhan’s courtyard, I at last confirmed the truth of the matter. Six years have now passed since the tree’s revival. Its height spans twice a man’s reach, its branches and boughs luxuriant, unlike any common wood. Four lateral shoots emerge, sturdy and sinewy, their bearing lofty as if straining toward the clouds. Master Changchun observed: “Utmost sincerity moves things; luminous virtue stirs Heaven—does this not describe Madam Zhan? Who says the Dao is distant? The fault lies only in man’s failure to cultivate true virtue.” Thus I composed forty words to record this wondrous response.

*On the day of...*
Outsiders slander with idle tongues,
Yet with empty heart she prayed for proof.
The long catalpa’s roots had rotted,
Yet from withered stump, fresh shoots arose.
Meng’s lament for yellow bamboo,
Tian Zhen’s sigh for purple brier—
Of old, filial piety was praised;
Today, loyalty stands revealed.

**Reply to Meng’an of Guoxian County**
Enamored of this land untouched by men,
I soar high, freed from the crow’s cage.
Reciting poems to pass the idle days,
Observing transformations in the still wind.
Staff in hand, I roam south of Southern Mountain,
Singing boldly east of Western Slope.
How many red-dust affairs exist?
None reach the realm of white clouds.

**Reply to Scholar Li Si of Guoxian County**
In deepest winter, most carefree,
Short days hasten my rounds.
Standing alone beyond the red dust,
I chant poems before emerald peaks.
Glancing sideways at the cave’s mouth,
My bright gaze rests on mountain summits.
Gazing afar at snowy green peaks,
Brilliant white mirrors the sky.

**Visiting Huaidao Village South of Mount Zhongnan, Lodging in a Bamboo Garden**
Seeking the Dao in Huaidao,
My feelings far from worldly passions.
At ease, my spirit soars;
Half-asleep, my dreams still stir.
The immortal’s courtyard, elegant in its scenery,
Jade groves bathed in moonlight’s clarity.
A scholar truly finds delight—
Why cling to purple-robed honors?

**In Praise of Master Changsheng**
Whose blessed company do I keep?
Among immortals, who is most favored?
The eminent scholar of Donglai,
The renowned figure of Xiluo.
Later, he received the ancestral teachings;
He was the last to leave the household,
First to establish the model of Dao and virtue.
Deeply he knew the power of youth,
Thus moved by sages’ support.

**In Praise of Master Yuyang**
A true immortal of the ancient land,
A great man of the Eastern Realm.
Pure and lofty, how unlike the vulgar,
Bright and untrammeled, beyond worldly dust.
Inner and outer gifts bestowed by Heaven,
His conduct and retreat peerless in the age.
Timely he discerns fortune and misfortune,
His proofs silently commune with the divine.

**Inscribed at the Temple of the Great Duke of Panxi**
One scene unites high and low,
Three peaks stand guard through ancient and modern times.
The path winds through cloud-washed caves,
The shrine nestles deep by the angling stream.
From crevices, flying springs burst forth,
Ancient cypresses shade the sky.
How joyous this pure and secluded place—
Fit to gladden the heart of a rustic.

**Spring Day Excursion**
Emerging from the Hall of Azure Clouds,
I turn and gaze across the eight wilds.
Clouds disperse, a thousand li made clear,
Wind scatters the fragrance of a hundred flowers.
The sea of desire stirs distant sorrows,
Spring mountains awaken lasting delight.
Leaning on my staff, the climb complete,
I plunge deep into the land of intoxication.

**First Snow**
Last night’s rain turned to snow,
This morning the earth transformed to silver.
The window brightens, yet dawn has not come;
The wilds darken, yet dust is no more.
From the sea, golden waves grow pale,
Across the sky, jade trees stand new.
At first sight, purity fills the eyes—
Enough to stir the poet’s heart.

**Autumn Rain**
For two nights, Heaven sends down rain,
In clear autumn, the earth swells with waves.
Gloom veils sun and moon,
Surging waters swell rivers and streams.
At the Purple Frontier, returning geese bear sorrow,
On green mountains, recluses sing their songs.
Unfazed, I dwell in my stone chamber,
High-pillowed, chanting amidst mist and vines.

**Leaving the Capital**
Just beyond the imperial capital,
I chant poems, my rustic spirit soaring.
The parrot, freed from its cage, is splendid;
The phoenix, spreading its wings, is wondrous.
A white horse gallops lightly,
Green mountains drift slowly by.
Chang’an, a brocade of a thousand pieces—
Undoubtedly, I shall arrive soon.

**Ascending Western Mountain of Yizhou**
Lifting my robes, I tread barren ground,
From the summit, I survey the autumn’s minutiae.
Deep valleys plunge into dark abysses,
Jumbled peaks rise in towering layers.
The forest’s chill chills to the bone,
My eyes strain with the vastness.
Laughing at this heartless wanderer,
How can I compare to the gibbons of cassia cliffs?

**Inscribed at Mount Ai**
A single dark cloud, cold and aloft,
Stands solitary amidst the distant haze.
Heaven hangs over the vast blue sea,
Earth anchors the leisurely white clouds.
Though its name is hidden among the Five Peaks,
The path to the Three Spirits may yet be climbed.
At times, I observe stones transformed by touch,
Sweet dew anointing the dusty world.

**Gazing Toward Kunlun**
Once I dwelled in Kunlun’s land,
A single glance southeast brings joy.
Jade peaks array like sea and mountains,
Cloud brocade scatters like heavenly flowers.
Qi gathers, concentrating triple excellence,
Spirit clears, surpassing the Nine Flowers.
Now, as spring snow melts,
My eyes brim with cinnabar white.

**Ascending Penglai Pavilion**
Once atop Penglai Pavilion,
With empty heart, I gaze into the distance.
Clouds shift, mountains seem to grow,
Waters reach the sea and vanish.
Below, I peer into the dragons’ lair,
Beside me, I watch the magpies’ bridge.
Why fear the distant, weightless ascent?
The cinnabar heavens lie close at hand.

**Gazing at the Sea**
Sea’s hue swallows Heaven’s hue,
Wind’s voice mingles with water’s voice.
Clouds churn, startling fish and turtles,
Thunder roars, shocking gods and spirits.
Waves surge against a thousand perilous cliffs,
Vast and boundless, a myriad li of calm.
Now, without a fisher of giant turtles,
Who will cast a line to hook the great whale?

**Mountain Hall After Rain Clears**
Morning sun, three poles high, shines bright,
A thousand peaks stretch level in the distance.
Chanting high, my spirit grows ever freer,
Gazing far, my eyes grow ever clearer.
After rain, the eaves drip with moisture,
Wind arrives, the seat grows cool.
If one’s heart is not aligned with the Dao,
Do not let them pass my gate.

**Two Poems on the Moon at Midnight**
**I**
The midnight moon, steadfast and bright,
Walks alone where none accompany.
Below, it joins the white of the blue sea,
Above, it fills the void with purity.
Its traces leave the Three Isles,
Its light roams, illuminating ten thousand cities.
In those cities, how many guests lie,
Too deep in sleep to be stirred.

**II**
The midnight moon, steadfast and bright,
Shines alone where none accompany.
At the sky’s edge, the Dipper dims,
On earth, a hundred evils take fright.
Wild cranes are faintly discerned,
A host of dragons soar and cry.
On ordinary nights of the fifteenth,
Never has it been so clear.

**Early Winter: Rain Delays the Purchase of a Horse**
In the tenth month, torrential rain,
At the third watch, roaring waves.
Floating clouds link sea and peaks,
Rushing waters flood the mountain city.
Wilds darken, wind and waves rage,
Mud deepens, roads collapse.
Travelers and galloping horses alike
Race through the night till dawn.

**First Snow**
As the tenth month draws to a close,
By chance, I see the six-petaled snowflakes fly.
Scattered and swift in the whirling wind,
Intricate and faint as night falls.

**Mountains and Rivers as a Faint Screen**
Mountains and rivers like a pale bed-curtain,
Stars and constellations lose their pearl-like gleam.
Dawn’s light pierces the sky, so pure,
Silver clouds dazzle the eye with radiance.

**Spring Outing**
One night of spring wind brings warmth,
By the third watch, dawn’s sun glows bright.
Every mountain wears brocade,
No land but blooms with flowers.
Golden Valley stirs deep feeling,
Peach Blossom Spring is easily misjudged.
Turning back, all is but a dream—
I tell this to the Daoist’s household.

**Two Poems on a Spring Night’s Rain**

**I**
Mountain light remains cold and faint,
Scenery not yet arrayed.
Fine rain clings to all things,
A gentle breeze touches no one.
Harmony warms the third month,
One by one, a hundred flowers renew.
Lying in the quiet chamber at night,
I idly chant of spring by the sea.

**II**
How late the spring colors arrive—
At Clear Brightness, no flowers appear.
Opening the window to watch emerald bamboo,
Brushing soil to find golden sprouts.
Night rain falls softly,
A balmy breeze grows fair.
As the third month draws unevenly to a close,
Peach and plum blossoms fill the horizon.

**Cloud Peaks**
In the scorching ninth month of summer,
A thousand mountains steam with sultry qi.
Soaring space at first is vast and hazy,
Then shifts in layers, ever-changing.
Towering and sheer, fit for a painting,
Too lofty for mortal ascent.
When shall I ascend as an immortal,
Riding a crane to soar above?

**Rafting Timber with the Wind**
Lacking timber for the temple’s repair,
The master craftsman was ordered to raft logs from north of the sea.
Near the shore, wind held them back for over ten days.
In autumn’s eighth month, on the ninth day,
A southwesterly wind arose—
The rafts rode it at last to Jiaodong.
As the sun sets, the golden wind follows,
Tides level, the rafts set forth.
Cloud-sails race the shore in haste,
Dawn’s sun rises, gilding the sky.
Though the north sea brings many trials,
Jiaodong is spared from great disaster.
No need to fear the grand hall unfinished—
Fine timber is already here.

**Self-Portrait**

**White Hair**

White hair grows longer with the years,
Rosy cheeks fade day by day.
Failing to grasp the Dao’s arts,
I long to seek the pine and crane immortals.
Where to find the elusive spirit?
How to refine the returning elixir?
Following the Three Caverns’ secrets,
All worldly ties dissolve at last.

---

**Quatrain**

*Lantian*
A thousand valleys unfurl like brocade,
A thousand peaks stand as painted screens.
After rain, the blue waters gleam white,
Clouds part to reveal jade mountains green.

---

**Returning to Mount Long (Two Poems)**

The crane’s nature loves the mountains,
Cloud-capped peaks wondrous in summer’s heat.
To escape the wind, it crosses the sea,
After rain, it lingers not in pools.
Beneath the tall pine it sits alone,
By jagged stones it chants in solitude.
At night it rides a crimson-crested crane,
Visiting the immortals of the white clouds.

---

**On the Folly of Things (Two Poems)**

Heaven births the ten thousand kinds,
The ten thousand kinds belong to Heaven.
Why does it permit cruelty and tyranny,
Denying life its wholeness?
Yin and yang shape creation,
Life and death alternate in rise and fall.
Most piteous are the sentient beings,
Who suffer hearts devoid of goodness.

---

**Autumn Night (Two Poems)**

Dew-laden air holds autumn’s crispness,
Heaven’s light illumines the night.
A waning moon dims over the ridge,
Dawn’s wind clears the stream.
Jade-like dew stretches through the endless night,
The Silver River gleams in autumn’s sky.
Wind carries the valley’s purity,
Moonlight chills the celestial thoroughfare.

---

**Dawn (Two Poems)**

The Silver River shifts its hue,
Stars and constellations wheel in the void.
A half-moon gleams pale and white,
Dawn’s glow blazes crimson for miles.
Cranes dance as night yields to dawn,
A dream of wandering immortals startles awake.
The moon cradles the mountain, vast and growing,
Wind crosses the water, pristine and clear.

---

**Pure Joy (Two Poems)**

Three winters spent roaming the seas,
Six-petaled snowflakes blanket the earth.
To visit the grottoes of immortals,
I pass by the homes of Daoist adepts.
Wine flows smooth as golden dew,
Tea steeps with the fragrance of jade mushrooms.
Spirit refreshed, I grasp the three mysteries,
Harmony dispels a hundred ills.

---

**Creation (Three Poems)**

Creation wields divine transformation,
Forms fill the boundless cosmos.
The deluded suffer endlessly,
Even sages cannot awaken them.
The primal chaos split in an instant,
Empty blossoms flourish through the ages.
Wondrous changes shift a myriad times,
Yet the Dao and virtue abide in mystery.
A thousand flowers bloom in their season,
The three luminaries align in measured brightness.
The Nine Heavens’ palaces turn,
The eight directions arise

**Creation (Three Poems, continued)**

Not seeing desire before one’s eyes,
Only then does one know the heart’s emptiness.
With feeling, the Dao seems distant;
Without affairs, the mind feels vast.

Creation opens the celestial cavern,
The spirit endures the biting cold.
Boundless, the Three Realms stretch wide,
Profound, the hundred evils run deep.
The Dao abides through all ages,
Yet living beings never fathom the heart.
Of the five fortunes, only long life stands high;
Of the three luminaries, only humans align.

Leisurely I pass the years,
Unfettered, unbound by dust.
Sages and worthies are not far from the Dao—
Virtue lies in human cultivation.
If not sought within this heart,
Where else could it be found?

---

**Twenty Poems on Cultivating the Dao**

Eyes and ears depart from sound and color,
Body and mind transcend being and non-being.
Naturally, one communes with creation—
Why debate the fine or coarse?

The qi-refining, heart-cleansing adept
Soars above the world, a towering standard.
The heart, steadfast as a mountain,
Qi, ceaseless as the tides.

Ten thousand cares melt like wax,
The three poisons dissolve like ice.
Once free from the yin-yang shell,
What need to debate Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna?

The five eyes share one essence,
The three bodies branch from a single stem.
When the inch of heart is free of self,
Perfect enlightenment illumines the void.

Self-arising, self-vanishing,
Neither shallow nor deep.
Failing to realize the body is not the self,
How can one grasp that things are the mind?

Trampling the realm of emptiness,
Shattering the power of creation.
Floating clouds gather in stillness,
The sun of wisdom lights the zenith of meditation.

Where does a single word reside?
Ten thousand matters leave no trace.
Creation opens the celestial cavern,
The spirit endures the biting cold.

Though the eye’s faculties serve their use,
The mind’s ground rests in clarity.
For now, within this dream of life,
I wander freely with the myriad transformations.

The body may be narrow as a square foot,
Yet the heart spans the vastness of the void.
Though seas and mountains divide the four quarters,
The three luminaries are seen as one.

In the land of no-mind, quiescence reigns,
Radiance gleams through the great void.
Lapis lazuli cradles the jewel moon,
A net of pearls spans the heavens.

Ascending to truth, no turbid qi remains,
Transcending the world, one bears a pure standard.
Swiftly I depart the long night,
Obscurely I rise to the highest heavens.

The jade crucible boils with cinnabar,
The golden flask brims with fragrant wine.
Ghosts and spirits cannot fathom the heart,
Heaven and earth defy the measure of time.

Awakened from the dream of Huaxu,
The spirit roams the Purple Palace of Heaven.
I invite companions from the three isles,
Leisurely visiting immortals of the ten continents.

The Dao is attained through non-action,
Dharma arises from the mind’s intent.
If one can dissolve the three poisons,
One ought to transcend the five phases.

The Dao manifests through non-doing,
The heart arises through dharma.
Hun Yuan embraces all phenomena,
Tai Yi stirs the void to fame.

Movement arises from stillness,
Non-doing is itself doing.
Where the three lights do not shine,
The ten thousand forms reveal their clarity.

Originally attained without the heart’s effort,
Why labor with intent?
Where the five phases do not reach,
The myriad transformations all return.

The moon ascends, bright at mid-heaven,
The wind arrives, pure in the midnight hour.
In grotto-heavens, mortals never tread,
Yet the idle wanderer finds welcome.

The herb gardens and mushroom fields are pristine,
The golden altar and jade halls renewed.
Within the gourd, night never falls,
Beyond the world, spring is eternal.

The ten caves array the lofty perfected,
The three heavens house the exalted sages.
White clouds escort the traveler,
The azure bird conveys their letters.

**Ten Hymns in Praise of the Dao**

The Great Dao is without limit,
Long life knows no shore.
When kalpas end, the provisional returns to reality,
The turning of time blooms anew.

Virtue and the Dao bear no form,
No painting can capture their truth.
Sages and worthies silently aid the world,
Through past and present, they commune with the divine.

The Dao unfolds the three principles,
Heaven and earth display the ten thousand forms.
Mountains and rivers coil around the earth’s axis,
Sun and moon course through the celestial wheel.

In the indistinct, spirit is the trunk,
In the misty, qi is the sprout.
Heaven and earth are like long leaves,
Sun and moon resemble blossoms unfurled.

The Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,
Heaven perfects the work of creation.
Ghosts and spirits’ essence remains unseen,
Yet the qi of mountains and seas flows in secret.

The Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,
Heaven bestows the essence of rain and dew.
The three lights shine together,
The myriad transformations all take form.

The Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,
Humans receive the grace of rain and dew.
Through darkness and light, they follow sun and moon,
Creation emerges from heaven and earth.

Great simplicity embraces primordial qi,
From no direction, it receives the divine.
The divine penetrates creation,
Primordial qi weaves the warp and weft.

Great sages open heaven and earth,
Across the vast expanse, they array sun and stars.
Revolving, they divide day and night,
Through past and present, they illumine living beings.

Sun and moon radiate their brilliance,
Wind and thunder shake the depths.
In boundless harmony, no action is taken,
Yet transformation holds the numinous.

**Qiu Chuji of Eternal Spring at Mount Qixia: Lyrics Without Worldly Thoughts**

**#1 Dwelling at Panxi**
Alone I tread the steep path, drifting down the Qin River,
Westward into Panxi’s countryside.
Before the vast valley’s cliffs, beside the secluded stream,
I carve a cloud-high niche to rest my trace.
No smoke nor fire, no basket nor gourd laid by,
What daily needs have I to store?
Hungry, I eat; thirsty, I drink,
Seeking sustenance through village lanes as time allows.
Cold or hot, scraps or leftovers,
Fill my gut, no need for rare delicacies.
Weak or strong, I make do to pass the day,
Spared the toil of kitchen labor.
The skin-bag is clad, its pores steamed,
To moisten and replenish its fluids.
The colored body light and hale,
The Dharma-body easily nurtured.

**#2 Upholding Resolve in the Cold of Winter**
Amidst auspicious clouds and auspicious snow,
In the depths of winter’s frozen, sealed season,
A mountain hut stands silent and solitary,
All day without a soul to speak to.
Tattered sleeves worn again, alone in the cold cave,
The long night’s sorrow hard to endure.
Through endless watches, no sleep comes,
The north wind howls through the door, piercing and bleak.
Morning, I seek rice in the western village,
By the spring-lined path, jade-like leaves and frost-flowers form.
In Shaanxi grows a kind of grass, two feet tall, nameless.
In autumn and winter, its upper stem dies, the lower lives on.
At dawn’s chill, between the half-stems, ice forms two ridges,
Like the fletching of an arrow.
Frostbitten hands warmed by breath, yet still I resent
This impure frame, this mediocre mortal flesh.
Day and night, hunger and cold press in,
When will I transcend birth and death?
I must rely on steadfast will,
To shatter the moon of the ancient heart.

**#3 The Chessboard**
The road ahead is long, its splendor yet unseen—
Golden, jade-like, the immortal’s spirit and form.
In solitude, with no merit, heaven bestows upon me
A chessboard to brighten my face and while away the days.
Before the Ancient Minister’s Cliff, upon the Clear Wind Terrace,
I linger till the morning meal is done.
A recluse comes to visit,
Our refined hearts delight in the game’s subtle strategies.
At first, like riverside or seashore,
In threes and fives, scattered cranes and crows emerge.
Breaking ranks, charging passes, forming arrays,
Tangled like coiling dragons and serpents.
Brilliant calculations, clever schemes,
Diagonal leaps and straight advances—
Ten thousand changes all return to one.
In boundless divine function,
No need for arts beyond the world.

**#4 In Praise of the Master**
Vast and boundless, the bitter sea,
Like the eastern deep—profound, wide, bottomless.
Endless sentient beings, topsy-turvy in competition,
Like fish at play, vying in the waves.
Tossed by towering swells, submerged in surging waves,
Their cravings like drunken madness.
Adrift without end,
How few become soaring Peng to transcend!
Only that day’s Chongyang,
Clear-eyed and awakened, alone held lofty aspirations.
Studying the *Yi* in advanced years, his heart fully enlightened,
He snapped the reins of fleeting vanity.
After ten years, the elixir perfected,
In an instant, his work complete—
Shedding his shell like a cicada’s molt.
Since parting from the Master,
Who else has carried on his noble example?

**#5 The Straw Cape**
By the ancient banks of the deep stream,
When autumn comes, the sedge grows thick and lush without end.
Selecting the long and short, I return to the grotto,
Where the empty sky’s sunlight dries them.
Two bundles of silk dried, a thousand strands bound,
No need for skilled craftsmen’s discernment.
In my leisurely pavilion, I myself
Knit the fisherman’s garb.
At times, I roam with woodcutters and herders,
Through green mountains and emerald waters,
With rain and mist as my companions.
Exquisite beyond compare, to treasure in the twilight of secluded paths,
Donning it to push through reeds and rushes in the snow.
I have forgotten my name,
Others all call me by another—
The Straw Cape Guest.
Panxi calls me the Straw Cape Master.
When my work is complete in years to come,
I shall transform into clouds, vanishing without trace in the heavens.

**#6 The Bamboo**
Hollow-hearted, emerald bamboo,
Endowed by nature with a singular purity.
Beneath the moon, before the wind, fit for admiration,
Its banter free of worldly俗.
Tender leaves rustling,
Even in deep winter, they stand out amidst a thousand woods.
Its noble bearing, lustrous and smooth,
Like the cold jade of the Mystic Garden.
The good-hearted Lord Tian of Eastern Li—
The abbot of the eastern neighbor’s hermitage—
Newly planted them by South Stream,
Opening my eyes to verdant hues.
All day I gaze beyond the window, chanting high,
As the wind stirs the green tips of the bamboo.
Gently wafting, its subtle fragrance,
Sparse shadows swaying, soothing body and flesh.
A tranquil companion in the cloud niche,
Its refined spirit befits an immortal’s blessing.

**#7 The Moon**
Nestled by cliffs and ridges,
The long night’s stillness deepens—
Desolate, the demon of dusk is not alone.
The bright moon, clear and luminous, appears over the mountain,
Its radiance at the edge of heaven just emerging.
Dew congeals, frost forms,
Golden splendor, jade-like luster,
How ethereal and free!
Its purity descends upon the world,
Revealing the divine beauty of its form.
Mournful, the six directions’ multitudes,
Sunken in darkness, grieving in toil and sickness.
The great Dharma’s good causes widely spread salvation,
All attain carefree tranquility.
Vast qi surges,
Its lingering light suffuses—
How could this true nature ever falter?
The perfect brightness of the Dharma-realm,
The Dharma-wheel ever self-sustaining.

**#8 Late Autumn**
Frost-laden winds sweep and stir,
Dancing, scattering leaves slant across the paths.
Gazing to the farthest reaches of the long fields,
Withered chrysanthemums, mottled, still bloom.
Specks of gray-green moss,
Endless morning dew,
Gradually congealing into white frost.
Mountains high and low,
All become a single hue of autumn.
Unfettered, all things wither and decay,
The weather desolate and bleak,
Saddening the traveler on the road.
The roots of clouds in valleys offer no delight,
Only the verdant pines and cypresses remain.
Those who awaken to the Dao, true immortals,
Those who forget worldly schemes, recluses—
From ancient times, they share this standard.
Defying the cold, surpassing the multitude,
Ever since heaven and earth began, they have been thus endowed.

**#9 Confused Longing**
The four seas and myriad mountains,
At dusk, the sky clears—
Dispelling lurking yin demons.
Before the Taiyi Cliff, the wind’s path swift,
A thousand-foot wave churns the toad’s legs.
Furious snow, startling waves,
Crashing against the dike, pounding the shore,
Thunder rolls, clouds tumble in pursuit.
Green gulls and white egrets,
Fly swiftly over the moonlit river.
High and low, a thousand flocks, ten thousand groups,
Calling, summoning, gathering at the bend of the clear river.
The moon’s jewel, the divine pearl, now entice,
Rolling forth, all restraint forgotten.
Leaping, floating, exquisitely radiant,
Their worth suddenly like jade worth a thousand cities.
In boundless brilliance,
They overturn heaven and earth.

**#10 Immortal Scenery**
The Ten Continents and Three Isles,
Bearing eternal spring—boundless the light of endless night.
Jade pavilions and crystal towers rise upon the peaks,
Towering, majestic, a thousand feet high.
Green cypress and towering pines,
Crimson clouds and dense mists,
Cluster round the immortals’ abode.
Vast the sea of clouds,
Yet where is the water to be found?

From afar, recalling Xu Fu of old,
His towering ships sailing east—
Gone without a trace.
Ten thousand miles of azure waves stretch empty and vast,
Far as the autumn sky’s edge.
Grieving for mortal life,
How escape the transformations of things?
How wander the immortal realms?
To transcend the mundane, to enter sagehood,
Lies in the ease of the body beyond the body.

---

**#11 Delighting in the Dao**
Welcoming the present, sending off the past,
Sighing for spring blossoms and autumn moons,
Year after year, as promised.
Things shift, stars drift, human affairs change—
How many rise and fall, sink into oblivion?
Households fed by a thousand soldiers,
Officials ennobled to the first rank,
Yet even these find no refuge.
Time flashes like lightning,
A hundred years stolen away in an instant.

Fortunate to awaken within the Mystery Gate,
To rend the web of doubt,
To crash through to true joy.
Enveloped in auspicious radiance within the white jade pot,
A single grain of divine elixir gleams bright.
Beneath the moon, before the wind,
Enduring as heaven and earth,
Freely riding the phoenix and crane.
The illusory dream of the world—
Unbearable to revisit once more.

---

**#12 Nature’s Permeation**
The Dharma Wheel first turns,
Wisdom’s wind arises—
Suddenly, boundless cool clarity.
Bright hues congeal in the void, auspicious qi gathers,
Dispelling the dust’s vexations from breast and mind.
The Five Thieves flee,
The Three Corpses vanish,
No trace within or without.
The spirit rests in peace,
Profoundly still, unmoved by spear or halberd.

Strolling the purple paths of the red dust,
Hungry, one eats; thirsty, one drinks,
Passing days as fate allows.
Beyond things, in leisure, lies heaven and earth’s treasure,
From time to time, the chime of jade rings.
A later pact to seek a master,
A future path to return home—
True tidings come of themselves.
The crane’s summons arrives,
Seated, one ascends the Milky Way to wander.

---

**Three *Shen Yuan Chun* Poems to Instruct the Assembly**

**I**
Worldly affairs surge like water rushing east—
When will they ever end?
Sighing for fame and profit through the ages,
Vying like tigers and leopards,
While hills and plains, in a single day,
All keep company with foxes and jackals.
Amid thorns and brambles,
Within the shade of mulberry and elm,
Who among the piled-up graves knows who is who?
Do you know?
In vain, a hundred years of toil,
Only to furrow one’s brows in vain.

How much better to return home!
Release the Four Great Elements,
Roaming freely, doing nothing.
By ancient cliffs and caves,
Preserve life’s essence;
Facing the wind, beneath the moon,
Laugh and wander in carefree ease.
A song of mystery,
A thousand goblets of fine wine,
As the sun and moon cycle on—never aging!
A youthful face remains,
Ever granting the tortoise’s longevity, the crane’s years,
No need to sing of the yellow cock’s lament.

**II**
Feasting from tripods in grand splendor,
Hare flees, crow flies—
In a turn of the head, all fades to silence.
Like lightning splitting the night,
A sudden flash amid the clouds;
Morning frost greeting the sun,
Hardly enduring upon the grass.
Proud steeds and literary fame,
Inscribed bridges and renown—
All fleeting, like tales from a dream.
How much better I,
Emulating the carefree, calming thoughts,
Returning to simplicity, restoring the original.

Pitiable the wondrous scenes within the pot—
A realm apart,
Of wind, flowers, snow, and moon.
Playing with the four seasons as they appear,
Auspicious clouds and propitious qi,
The Three Lights’ radiance enveloping,
Jade grottoes and jeweled feasts.
Overflowing cups of rosy dawn,
Chanting ancient melodies,
Bones strong, spirit clear—the elixir naturally rounds.
Truly worthy of love—
Awaiting the moment of accomplishment,
To eternally abide as a flying immortal.

**III**
Wise sons of men,
Swiftly awaken to the toils of the dusty world,
Do not weary your nature.
For this body and those things—
All are but illusions,
More empty than real,
Not to be pursued.
A thousand entanglements,
Ten thousand sinkings,
As time slips by, aging you.
How much better to turn
To the true teachings of the Great Mystery,
To discuss the carefree and formless.

Heaven and earth vast, with no reliance—
Like a single drifting cloud,
Emerging from the world, wondrous.
Awakening to the nature’s union with the Dao,
The mountain of karma easily crumbles;
The divine boat reaches shore,
The bitter sea cannot bewilder.
When deeds are complete and merit fulfilled,
One soars as an immortal, transformed by feathers—
What compares to returning to the earth’s depths?
Nothing else matters—
To ascend to heaven, to enter the earth,
All lies in the mind’s doing.

---

**#2 Mind’s Permeation**
Great wisdom, leisurely and free,
Unfettered, following nature’s course.
Entrusting refined feelings and hidden joys,
Among pines and upon rocks,
Singing loudly, deeply drunk,
Beneath the moon, before the wind.
Jade maidens play the sheng,
Golden youths dance with sleeves,
Escorting me, tipsy, into the Great Mystery.
Within the Mystery’s principle,
All floating and sinking, vast and boundless,
Coming and going, ceaselessly.

Wondrous! The ineffable marvelous scene—
Count it as another
Heavenly grotto in the human world.
Proudly standing, body steadfast,
Mountains wear away the years;
Let the frivolous change,
Seas turn to mulberry fields.
Spirit and qi harmoniously surge,
Yin and yang rise and fall—
Already claiming the carefree life of an earthbound immortal.
Without affliction,
Freely open the heart, wield the brush,
Wildly inscribing poems.

---

**#3 On the Ninth Day, Offering the Morning True Rite at Guoxian**
Resplendent Double Ninth,
Auspicious qi drifting, drifting,
Encompassing the vast thousand worlds.
Just as the old hermitage gathers,
Guests and friends in throngs,
The azure sky faintly visible,
Wild geese gracefully gliding.
Everywhere, climbing heights,
Holding cups, carefree delight,
Unfettered as earthbound immortals.
At the Morning True Assembly,
Praising the golden wind’s gentle sway,
The jade dew’s freshness.

Tender yellow blossoms, lovely buds,
Wafting delicate fragrance,
Filling the seats.
Enabling all to taste and savor,
Each awakening to the supreme Dao,
While the flock of orioles falls silent—
Only the autumn king’s voice rings through the sky.
Lush apricots, bewitching peaches,
Spring’s riotous splendor—
None dare contend with frost’s steadfastness.
Seizing the joyous moment,
Facing the radiant clusters, drinking to intoxication,
A single drunkenness lasting three years.

---

**Water Dragon Chant: Western Hao**
Phoenix cries in the southern village, pure and fine,
A great immortal descends, riding the phoenix’s land.
Jewel palaces and precious pavilions,
Star altars and moon halls,
Scholars’ groves and verdant bamboo.
Incense canopies and cloud banners,
Shadows swaying in the cold halls,
Coming and going, manifesting auspiciousness.
Gazing east from the empty pavilion,
The plain spreads like brocade,
The mighty river flows,
Vast as the horizon.

Mountains fair, waters sweet, people righteous—
Every ward and village
Brimming with harmonious qi.
I come, unable to bear
Lightly departing from Liu and Jiang,
Heaven’s heart and earth’s lungs.

**Waiting for the Time**
We must await the hour when hidden dregs are sifted,
Nurturing the cinnamon of elixir’s truth.
On Chang’an’s road, they sleep on ice and lie beneath the sun,
Becoming lifelong marvels.

**II. Admonition to the World**
Counting the haste of this floating life,
All vie in craving and idle vexation.
Six dynasties, five hegemons,
Three kingdoms split seven ways—
Eastward campaigns, westward wars.
Where now are those martial schemes?
Only desolation,
Wildflowers and fragrant grasses.
Mourn the deep designs, the far-reaching plans,
The heroic hearts and towering qi—
All dimmed to ash, all withered to dust.

I have traversed Chang’an’s ancient roads,
Asking the hundred-year-old elders of the ruins.
Tang courts and Han markets,
Qin palaces and Zhou gardens—
All plainly declare their tale.
Former sites linger, yet
Former men have scattered,
No word left to send.
Consider the ephemeral—
Born at dawn, dead by dusk—
Who can secure heaven’s permanence, earth’s endurance?

**III. Clear Night**
The night clears, vast and chill at first,
The pale sky gleams like flawless beryl.
Beneath the unshaded trees,
Atop Chang’an’s towers,
The moon shines bright, the wind is fine.
A hundred ills dissolve in silence,
Ten thousand households share the same pure savor.
See Venus gleam,
The Silver River gleam,
Their radiance intertwined,
Filling heaven and earth.

The azure void flows like water,
Unobstructed in its boundless course.
It surges against mountains, crashes upon seas,
Pouring forth light, teeming with splendor,
Endlessly emitting auspiciousness.
From this moment on, understanding dawns—
The treasure vase stands firm,
The jade nectar flows freely.
To whom shall I pour out my heart’s longing?
Who will comprehend?
Let us drink deep and grow blissfully drunk.

**IV. Spring Inspirations (Two Poems)**

**I**
The Wu sky stretches wide, newly clear,
Qi revives, and all things flourish in joy.
Pavilions rise and fall,
Mountains soar and valleys dip,
Woven into brocade’s richness.
Emerald grottoes, limpid springs—
Their echoes ring afar,
A single, ceaseless stream.
Ever and again, I lift my gaze,
Gazing into the distance,
Where blue peaks touch
The white clouds’ melody.

Countless numinous birds and wondrous beasts
Console my idle heart,
Unmoved by woodcutter’s lean frame.
Wind-whispering verdant pines,
Twin cliffs vie in height,
A thousand trees compete in splendor.
Sunlit cinnabar terraces,
Four seasons for companions,
A hundred years of life’s span.
Let cold come, let heat depart,
Let stars shift and things transform—
I sleep high through the day.

**II**
Grotto-heavens brim with spring’s hues,
Jumbled peaks embroider a thousand heaps of brocade.
Clouds withdraw, rain ceases,
Dawn clears, mist thins,
The azure sky lies pillowed across the land.
I recline in bliss,
My cares unfurled,
Delusions dissolved, sleep forgotten.
Behold the immortal blossoms, auspicious herbs—
Facing the wind, bathed in sunlight,
They glow with radiance,
Transcending the mundane.

A time of joy and abundant harvest,
All nations at peace,
Every evil restrained.
Within this realm of Great Peace,
On Chang’an’s streets,
What hinders free passage?
The Great Dao is without doubt,
Side paths and crooked trails
Need no scrutiny.
For since the primal kalpas,
Even immortals passing by
Have known such scenes.

**V. The Dao’s Course**
At the Primordial’s first unfolding on Southern Marchmount,
Auspicious clouds pierced Kunlun’s outer bounds.
Stars shifted, lightning turned,
Yin ascended, Yang descended,
Crimson light drifted in the distance.
Cranes danced, phoenixes soared,
Watching the black tortoise and
The crimson serpent coil afar.
All within the primordial qi,
Refined into creation—
The Dao of immortals
Completed in an instant.

Clouds disperse across the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,
Within the grotto-heavens, deep—
Moon bright, wind gentle.
Now I claim
The gate of longevity,
A body tuned to distant years.
Let others chant as they will,
Though seas shift and mountains change,
Though stones wither and pines age.
I alone wander amidst mist and rosy clouds,
Beyond the realm of *fei-fei*—
Only lamenting that few know my tune.

**Lyrics to "Court Filled with Fragrance"**

**I. Expressing My Heart**
Adrift in form, unmoored in spirit,
My madcap traces resemble an untethered boat.
Carefree all day,
Well-fed, I roam at will.
Let them offer high office and heavy emoluments,
Golden fish pendants,
Fat horses and light furs—
What do I know?
Zhuang Zhou dreamed of butterflies,
Butterflies dreamed of Zhuang Zhou.

Enough.
I understand:
Greed for wealth, lust for beauty,
Sickness and sorrow abound.
Better a hempen robe and straw sandals,
Passing the seasons in leisure.
As I wander village lanes,
Children all call out,
Offering rice to detain me.
I know well—
The dream of Southern Branch is over,
My heart seeks nothing more.

**II. Admonition to the World**
A hundred-foot tower, perilous,
A thousand grand halls,
With wanton songs and effortless comings and goings.
This illusory body—how wretched!
No different from a candle in the wind.
Once, they flaunted boundless wealth,
Dazzling as the age’s brightest heroes.
A hundred years hence,
Where will all this lead?
In a single day, all turns to emptiness.

Gentlemen,
Awaken early!
Withdraw, retreat,
Leap free from the cage.
Recall the original, single spark—
Lost in endless wandering.
Fortunate to meet an age of peace and plenty,
Steal moments of leisure,
Let understanding grow round.
Where thoughts dissolve,
Luminous waves settle,
Alone I guard the crystal palace.

**III**
In my youth, I left home,
Poor and alone, delighting in the Dao,
My heart drifting beyond the world like tumbleweed.
The graves in my homeland,
Neglected through the seasons,
No rites performed.
Fortunate that the village’s worthy men joined forces,
Dug new tombs,
Erected pagodas in layers.
The remains were gathered,
Moved together,
Reinterred in the great burial ground.

People from beyond the pass
All speak of their great virtue,
Each repaying my humble self.
Hearing their words,
My heart brims with boundless gratitude.
I regret I have no way to repay their kindness,
Only redoubling my resolve,
Deepening my devotion to the mysterious work.
With profound reverence,
I dedicate this to my Daoist companions,
Each may suffer fewer calamities.

**IV. The Ninth Day**
Wild geese call from the frontier,
Gardens change their hues—
Late autumn bears a different scene.
Silken waves stretch across the land,
Brocade trees mirror the endless sky.
After rain, clouds and mountains stand bold,
Frost-kissed, golden chrysanthemums bloom in splendor.
On this fine day,
A thousand gates, ten thousand households
Celebrate Double Ninth with joy and laughter.

Auspiciousness—
Who is blessed to meet
The four friends of my gate,
First to taste the purest flavors?
They drink deeply of clear dew,
Often pouring rosy nectar.
When the draught of ghee anoints their crowns,
They return home—
The moon fills the empty hall.

Free from care, blissfully joyous,
Drunk and deep in the immortal realm.
Divine radiance gleams from three heads—
*Shengsheng Man* #5

Joy and sorrow cast aside,
Sight and sound forgotten,
From the first, called "Seeking Stillness."
Ignorant of the root,
They stubbornly debate right and wrong.
Plucking flowers, picking leaves in vain,
Exhausting schemes to no avail.
Such matters—
All may grasp them easily,
Yet none can truly follow.

Not in verbal sparring,
Nor in vying before others,
With pretentious learning and vast knowledge.
The noble one contends not,
Only seeks to return to simplicity and dispel doubt.
In darkness, release the four great elements,
Let worldly toils scatter in an instant.
Once recognized,
The wise will clap their hands and laughingly return.

Furthermore—
Probing the Three Teachings,
Guiding all beings,
All are led to align with Heaven.
Aspiring to the Dao, cultivating truth,
In movement, stillness, sitting, lying—all is devotion.
First, preserve the body’s purity,
Within, ever hold compassion for all beings.
Subdue sharpness,
This is the initial act and foundation of the beginner’s mind.

Gently refining temperament,
Cutting away residual desires,
Ever pruning folly and delusion.
With blessings and wisdom both complete, enlightenment dawns,
Naturally entering stillness.
Within the sacred chamber, no remorse,
Amidst all circumstances, no doubt.
Thoroughly awakened,
All of empty space severs right and wrong.

Moreover—
The gate of truth-cultivation,
The great tradition of the Daoist family,
A boundless realm of eternal spring.
Vital essence brimming,
In leisure, another world within a gourd.
Heaven’s midst, natural joy,
Revolving the Three Lights day by day.
No reliance on cunning,
Only pure wind, level and vast,
The sagely Dao, even and serene.

A single thought returns to the quiet homeland,
The Three Palaces enshrouded,
Pure spirit—ten thousand streams return to the source.
Vast and boundless, divine radiance comes and goes,
Penetrating the bones, unbroken.
The practitioner suddenly sheds all artifice,
Awaiting the day of accomplishment, ascending as an immortal.
For those yet to begin,
Seek a single word of clarity within these verses.

Ascending the cinnabar clouds—
The grotto-heavens clear,
Divine mountains fair,
Few tread their paths.
All cling to the towering dream of the world.
Immortal winds and auspicious scenes,
Though suddenly before their eyes, they remain as blind.
In the River of Love, all day,
They rise and sink, drifting to and fro.

East they rise, west they set,
South they die, north they live.
Turning through the four directions,
Transforming into myriad forms.
When will this fleeting life
Open the eye of Dao and quell desire?
May their spiritual essence awaken,
Grasping the flower of emptiness,
Ascending the distant shore.

Part Two

**To Jiaogu Longhu, Military Commissioner of Jingzhao Prefecture**

Grateful for imperial grace, bearing Heaven’s decree,
He guards the southwest—
The great gates stand open, high against mist and haze.
Twice entrusted with dual authority,
Beyond his term, yet none replace him; he ascends again.
The realm and army rest in peace,
All affairs harmonious, disasters sealed away.

The years draw late,
His heart turns to the Dao,
Searching the mysterious path, seeking pure discourse.
Lowering his noble rank, humbled without shame,
A mountain man, unbound—
Originally possessing nothing, what is there to compare?
Only through kindness and forbearance,
Renouncing excess and lust,
May his name be inscribed among the immortals’ ranks.

**Part Three**
**In Reply to Peiman Zhen’guo, Defender of Longzhou**

Weary of worldly toil, he casts aside family cares,
Yearning for purity and leisure.
Beyond the mundane, he gazes upon the mortal realm—
In an instant, all shifts and fades,
Like mirage towers, songs tilting, or surging sea waves.
Fleeting as a moment’s light,
A lifetime vanishes like a flick of the finger.

Sky-toppling wealth, city-toppling beauty,
Peerless valor, heart-piercing cunning—
All chase after illusions, trapped in endless cycles.
Drunken and deluded, they contend and struggle,
Worn to ruin by suffering.
Better to awaken early,
To dwell with mist and clouds,
High in the mountains, lost in slumber.

**Moon Immortal • Moon Gazing**
The sun sinks in the west,
I ascend the high terrace, gazing afar at heaven and earth’s vast expanse.
Scattered stars flicker in and out,
While a single bright moon hangs in the void,
Luminous, unattached.
Radiant beyond the Three Realms,
Like a hundred-times-refined bronze mirror, it leaps forth.
Its light pours everywhere,
Illuminating every household,
Opening gates to boundless emptiness.

A wind of eternal life, a thousand miles of clarity,
Aids the swaying of heaven and earth,
Though clouds and mist dare not arise.
In the immortal palaces and jeweled halls,
Golden splendor and azure radiance intertwine.
Great indeed is the night’s dissolving glow,
Everlasting through the ages, vast and unconfined.
Those with aspiration,
Climb the jade osmanthus,
To watch the toad in the moon pound elixir.

**Part Two • Mountain Dwelling**
Bells and chimes hang aslant,
I admire the recluses Chao and You,
Their secluded lives sparse and desolate.
By nature upright and unyielding,
I love my solitary self,
Wandering carefree through clouded valleys.
A thousand kinds of fame and profit—
Never once have they lingered in my heart.
Fortunate to live in this era of peace,
All armies at rest,
Swords and spears stilled.

The people sing of two ears of grain in abundance,
The teachings flourish, and I forget my vow—
The pact of the Three Isles.
Guests come and friends depart,
Day after day, I dwell in the hidden valley,
Riding phoenixes and cranes.
Before the grotto, endless scenes unfold—
Exotic blossoms bloom, fragrant winds burst forth.
I thank the people of Qianyuan,
Who share their meals to aid my long, joyous whistling.

**Part Three • Before the Pine**
Towering, the tall pine,
Leaning on floating clouds, claims the heights of the great mountain’s seclusion.
Solemn and aloof, the hidden scholar,
Loves the grotto-heaven’s caves,
Deeply concealed, utterly empty.
Before the gate, the view unfolds—
Gibbons and apes hang from the sheer cliffs.
All day, no other affairs,
Only harmonizing dragons and tigers,
Mating upon the seated boulder.

From time to time, cranes listen to fine music,
As the pipes and flutes flow and swirl,
Drifting beyond the empty sky.
Those enlightened to the supreme Dao
Detest the stifling of pipes and strings,
The drowning in flowers and indulgence.
I always admire this one,
Steadfast through the cold years,
Its dark hue unyielding.
Refining my nature beyond it,
I dwell in leisure, forever within the realm of longevity.

**Jade Terrace Moon • Self-Reflection**
All my life, indolent and idle,
I’ve gained only this—
A pillow of no cares, high in slumber.
Unkempt hair, a grimy face,
Heedless of the body’s decay.
I let the three luminaries—
Sun, moon, and stars—race day and night,
And the four great elements—
Wood, fire, earth, and water—bear the burdens of forests and springs.

By the deep stream,
To the left of the secluded crag,
Green mountains embrace,
White clouds enclose.
Disasters—
Thunder roars, lightning flashes,
Yet none can approach me.
At noon, I rise, walk, then sit again,
Shattering every old habit.
In this tranquil place,
Only these few remain.

Weary of greed, I delight in poverty,
Loving the freedom to idle, indifferent to smoke and fire.
No grain stored, no elixir sold.
Empty, I sing;
Unfettered, I harmonize.
Such is enough.

The immortal’s path unfinished,
I wander at ease, passing time as it flows.

**II. Exhorting to Wine**

Fleeting fame, fleeting gain—
I sigh for past and present,
the ceaseless toil of men lost in the mire.
Vast the cosmos,
how many sentient beings, wise or foolish,
all wear themselves out in vain,
spending their days in greed,
racing to their deaths in restless striving.
Behold the sun and moon,
lament this fleeting life—
a hundred years of life,
a spring’s dream of sleep.
What waste!
Better to fill the cup,
let rosy clouds escort my drunkenness,
bolster the four great elements to invigorate the spirit.
Discern the myriad transformations,
set aside talk of wealth and rank.
From time to time, seek out
the mountain-dwelling Daoist at play,
emulate his wild abandon,
chanting high beyond the world,
celebrating the bold zest of wine’s fine savor.
Open the heart’s embrace,
forget sorrow, strike the cares away.
Unravel the tangles,
blunt the sharp edges.

Far off,
green pines and white cranes,
year after year, drift by in serenity.

**Magnolia Blossoms Slow: The Turning Wheel**

I sigh for the numinous source, long lost through the ages,
boundless in truth, yet at ease.
Since the primordial simplicity scattered and form arose,
the chaos worn thin,
I have fallen into the prison of wandering.
Limping and stumbling, turning through the four directions,
lost in the ford, mired in the bitter sea’s depths.
The dharma-realm’s multitudes stir in turmoil,
dream-spirits drift through a thousand ages of longing.

Sunk in the flow—
bones traded like mountains,
who knows when the journey’s end will come?
Best to forge the true emptiness,
let the three luminaries’ wisdom shine,
gather the clouds of ten thousand kalpas.
In the end, one must cast off body and life,
yet how long will you cling to face and head?
Shatter the single point at the center,
and at once ascend the divine vessel to the other shore.

**To the Tune of "Gazing at the Sea Tide"**

In Xigu, those who do good abound,
and responses come again and again.
I stand in wait, gazing afar,
where clouds surge and qi rises from the northern mountains.
In an instant, the interplay of yin and yang shifts,
transforming through emptiness and nothingness,
vast and boundless, filling all.

The strange peaks take the shape of Mount Taihua,
their layered ridges steep, dyeing the sky with azure.
Sudden rain pours like ink from an overturned basin,
while swift thunder and flashing lightning roar.

**Mighty spirits!**
They unleash their divine powers,
turning the scorching heat of triple summer to solid ice.
Yet alas, where the whirlwind passes,
good fields are ravaged,
and grand houses topple.
Only in this land of the Dao do blessings flow,
where sudden lightness follows ceaseless tears.
I deeply trust that Heaven aids virtue,
and the fruits of good and evil are clearly divided.

**To the Tune of "Gazing at the Sea Tide"**
**On Cultivating the Dao**

The demeanor of immortals,
the gateway to longevity—
from ancient times, virtue and the Dao have been their foundation.
All else, if pursued with even a single thought,
leads to madness and folly, all in vain.
The true teaching dispels delusion,
handed down since the days of the Yellow Emperor,
who soared on a dragon’s chariot.
Passed through generations,
to this day, all return to its embrace.

The void and nothingness—
a rule shared by a thousand sages.
For it crushes cravings and desires,
revealing the secrets of heaven.
Greed and profit are like enemies;
seeing the body as a dream,
one clings to excess, neglecting appearance.
Return to simplicity, embrace the subtle and serene.
Let your face be unwashed, your hair disheveled,
clad in paper robes and hempen garments.
When merit is complete, cast all aside,
and wander the vast expanse,
stepping upon clouds and rainbows.

---

**To the Tune of "Breaking Free from the Mundane"**

A steadfast foundation,
a tranquil gateway—
this life is unlike worldly ties.
In secluded, vast mountains,
enlightened beings of the highest order
meander, emulating immortals.
Diligently they labor before the cliffs,
slowly planting osmanthus and pines,
tending herb gardens and fields of lingzhi.
Beneath peaks ten thousand fathoms high,
they keep company with tortoises and cranes,
passing the years in ease.

My heart has long been set on the remote and strange,
loving the simplicity of bamboo baskets and gourd ladles,
mocking the clamor of poetry and prose.
By secluded caves and small streams,
I open my heart to joy,
sometimes composing short verses, sometimes long.
Racing horses outpace flowered stationery;
freely I wield my brush, chanting wildly,
moving through mist and flying smoke.
Unrestrained, in suchness I abide,
mingling through the days,
carefree and content.

**To the Tune of "Drunken Immortal in Penglai"**
**On the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month, the Liu Family of Xigu Holds a Ritual**

Suddenly, the Three Pure Ones’ cranes descend,
as clouds gather from ten thousand miles,
and the vast sky clears to emerald.
Jade chimes ring out,
stirring heaven and earth with their sharp tones.
All day, the fast is observed,
the empty hall hosts the ritual,
celebrating the great immortals’ grace.
Libations overflow in rosy cups,
long songs and wondrous melodies
linger in the master’s heart.

This double ninth day,
chrysanthemums bloom in profusion—
just as the Double Yang arrives,
the pure autumn air is finest.
Fragrant winds scatter,
and red osmanthus sways in the crisp breeze.
Such rare beauty is seldom met,
and the highest immortals are hard to encounter—
fortunate to meet in this moment.
Wild geese cast shadows on the sand,
moonlight illuminates the night,
and all grow mellow with wine.

---

**To the Tune of "Joy of Heaven"**
**Remembering Dharma Kin**

From the eastern shores of the sea,
originally of three provinces,
four of us formed a bond.
In foreign lands and distant towns,
we walked and sat together,
passing days in shared play.
We spoke of mysteries, discussed wonders,
exploring the pure emptiness beyond the world,
the true flavor of the Daoist path.
In leisurely song and response,
what deep meaning bound our dharma kin!

Now, scattered far apart,
each with苦志 and diligent heart,
we refine ourselves, each escaping collapse.
Since we drifted apart,
meetings have been rare,
separated by secluded mountains and distant passes.
Divided by heaven and earth,
we gaze like fading stars at dawn.
When shall we meet again,
riding clouds to pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor?

---

**To the Tune of "Han Palace Spring"**
**On Perseverance**

For twenty years,
the great demon’s host clashed with the true ranks,
a thousand layers of trials to cross.
Wild arrows from mad bows darkened the windows,
endless in their fall.
Yet through mindful awakening,
I passed the years,
unobstructed in the true source.
Wielding the sword of wisdom,
the demon horde naturally scattered,
and I alone displayed mighty power.

Moving in and out of the radiant light of the eight directions,
my divine mechanism was unfathomable,
even heaven’s net could not contain me.
Sweeping clouds, clearing mist, shaking the dharma-realm,
I left no trace.
Soaring and transforming,
I roamed the great void,
where the wind howled in desolation.
Patrolling the four seas,
how many peers shared this journey?

---

**To the Tune of "The Traveling Merchant Stays"**
**On Cultivating the Dao**

Meeting at the four origins,
passing Mount Hua,
we arrived together in the land of Qin.
Singing and laughing,
we subtly revealed the joyous essence of Chongyang.
The effortless way naturally transforms people;
fortunate to be guided by heaven’s will,
official duties and worldly hindrances intervened.
Eastward, by the sea,
the three lords’ noble righteousness
opened wide the gates of the teaching.

The teaching spreads universally.
Yet I, parted from the group,
forget my form, too weary to rise.
Looking inward, I find no fault;
what external calamities could I fear?
The three luminaries wax and wane,
intertwining with myriad changes—
favor and harm arise from heaven and earth’s design.
I will remain for now,
awaiting the day I achieve my ambition in the azure heavens,
and walk with ease.

---

**To the Tune of "Plum Blossom Melody"**
**Old Retreat at Pan Creek**

A nameless guest,
with no ties or burdens,
no mulberry or catalpa, no fields or home.
Before the ancient cliff,
beside the old pine,
I sing long songs, leaning on my armrest,
slowly pondering the Great Mystery.
In silence, I discuss the deathless—
in reality, what ever separated self and other?
Through a thousand scriptures,
in harmony with the three spirits,
I embrace all transformations,
all returning to a single, profound thought.

No weariness in walking,
no fatigue in sitting.
Whether walking or sitting, I follow my whim.
The evening wind is light,
the twilight sky clear.
The great Dao is carefree,
the upper and lower reaches of South Creek level.
East of the creek, I fortunately found a friend who forgets form;
beneath the moon, we often pour wine to pass the night.
When the wine cup pauses,
the moonlight shines pure.
I loosen my robe, let down my hair,
joyfully singing of the Dao’s sentiment.

---

**To the Tune of "Six Orders"**
**On Dharma Nature**

When the primordial simplicity scattered,
heaven and earth first took on their hues.
As the crow flew and the hare ran,
the myriad beings and kinds unfolded.
A single point of suchness, the true nature,
plunged into this foul skin-bag.
The wandering soul lost the Dao,
drifting with the waves,
for ten thousand years and a thousand ages, never returning home.

The body of the primal chaos was broken,
and love and hate gazed upon each other day by day.
Yet one mistakes the parents’ form
for one’s own fine appearance.
Age after age, trading bones in the wheel of rebirth,
suffering endless hardship and calamity.
Who awakens early,
seeks the path home,
and restores the radiant vastness of the old, auspicious state?

---

**To the Tune of "Fragrant Water Chestnut"**
**On Begging for Food**

What is the purpose of this?
Wandering idly through the village,
seeking rice to fill my hunger.

**To the Tune of "Joyous Oriole"**
**On Tempering the Heart**

Blocking the gate, a starving dog,
charging and leaping like flight.
Baring fangs, glaring eyes,
ready to tear at the heart,
to gnaw the skin of the living.
True, it guards the house,
yet knows no good from evil,
no high from low.
Pity this yelping creature—
through many lives, perverse and base,
its nature sunk in darkness.
Precepts expounded, teachings performed,
yet it snaps at the ear, deaf to all.
Though the Most High
descends in person,
there is no place for mercy.
For men, best to cultivate early.
If you wait until then,
your resolve will come too late.

**To the Tune of "Partridge Sky"**
**On Refining the Heart**

Leave behind birth and death.
Take old habits,
one by one, grind them away.
Through a thousand layers of desire,
a hundred temperings of body and mind,
forge the heart to iron.
Let the six spirits harmonize,
the three corpses cease their stumbling.
With fierce resolve,
rely on this empty space,
this passionless discernment.

Break the bonds.
Only then will you meet the perfected one,
who transmits the subtle oral formula.
Suddenly, a divine wind
blows open the demon’s ranks,
and your form stands like wood carved, like clay molded.
Once you attain the celestial jewel of true nature,
you see through spring flowers and autumn moon.
At that time,
ghosts cannot summon you—
only immortals may lift you up.

**To the Tune of "Phoenix Perched on Wutong"**
**Sent to a Dao-Seeker in the East**

Where in the world is the fairest scene?
The Eight Waters, the Three Rivers—
since ancient times, the road to Chang’an.
Broidered trees, screen-like mountains, winding and distant,
who can reach the ends of earth and sea?

Since you’ve left home, do so early.
Set forth on cloud and water,
do not linger for idle flowers and grasses.
Press on to Tong Pass, to the Western Peak’s temple,
and your breast will open wide with clarity.

---

**Two Poems**
**A Dao-Companion Visits Me at Pan Brook**

A rugged cliff, a realm of purity.
I hew the earth to house myself,
embracing the Dao, forgetting knowledge and understanding.
Do not think it strange, my Dao-companion,
that I, poor and idle, cling to simplicity with nothing to offer.

Wealth and honor, fame and rank—what can they lean upon?
So much right, so much wrong,
so many perils breeding success and failure.
Jade-like feasts and fragrant incense never endure,
while plain gourd and bamboo bowl bring lasting peace.

---

**Reflecting on the Past**

Today I ponder the days gone by.
I knew my future path,
yet time stretched long and hard to traverse.
Heaven gave no great blessing, no aid,
and suddenly I wished to leave, but had no way to go.

A walking corpse, a moving skeleton—my heart has awakened.
Dreams drift endlessly,
so for now I dwell at Pan Brook.
Fortunate to have left the mansions of the powerful and bold,
yet still they come, from time to time, to visit me.

---

**Third Poem**
**Expressing My Feelings**

The golden crow wheels west to greet the White Emperor.
I gaze east at the silver toad,
its bright glow enfolding the green cassia.
Gradually I knock at *Nanhua*, joining the chrysanthemum gathering,
filling my cup with the North Sea’s wine until I’m drunk.

Drunk, I lie amid the hues of Zhongnan Mountain.
The mountain’s colors are pure and lofty,
the night sky unobscured by clouds.
Not a bird sings, the wind is soft,
the moon bright as day, the heavens like water.

---

**To the Tune of "Double Swallows"**
**Spring Mountains**

Spring mist drifts lightly,
green mountains smile,
floating clouds scatter across the boundless sky.
Flowers gleam, stones glisten,
strange wonders emerge from grotto-heavens.
Doors and windows stand high as ten thousand fathoms,
so that ears and eyes may feast on the wind’s delight.
The passions of countless kalpas,
vast and clear, leave not a speck of dust.

How lovely—
carefree and at ease.
Shedding the shackles,
casting off karmic debts and enmities.
Wind as neighbor, moon as companion,
the Dao harmonizes with the crystal sounds of heaven.
Endless towering, sublime scenes
are all bestowed upon the mountain hall to share.
The thousand sages’ priceless pearl—
who can name its price?
Ask: who understands?

---

**To the Tune of "Ten Thousand Years of Spring"**
**Earthen Cavern**

As autumn comes to the earthen cave,
warmth gradually grows, the yang-qi prevailing.
Secluded dwelling—
how the Daoists favor it.
Laziness, poverty, and illness abound.
The bitter cold of winter,
leaves fallen, mountains and rivers cleansed.
Before the window, the contest:
snow flies, the wind rages.

**Leisurely Recitations by the Heat**

**II. Patchwork Robe**
With autumn’s arrival, the patchwork robe,
worn close, feels ever more fitting.
Frost-cleansed sky—
the heart roams free, unbound.
No fear of the west wind’s might.
Hundreds of scraps, thousands of stitches,
stitched firm from top to toe.
Loose yet proper,
outwardly wild in spirit,
inwardly radiant as a luminous pearl.

**III. Cuckoo**
In spring’s warmth, misty and clear,
the cuckoo cries all day in fragrant trees.
Each call a bitter plea,
urging one to return home—
yet where is home to go?
I long to journey east,
but find no path to take.
You, sir, raise the question—
what proof do you hold?
All is but idle chatter.

**IV. Startled from Sleep**
Deep autumn night, profound and still,
the water clock drips long—sleep heavy with thoughts.
One must rely on
the Dao’s harmony and ease,
not yielding to the demon king’s sway.
Gather the spirit,
casting all things from the heart.
Within the empty tent,
the lamp of wisdom shines bright.
Seated, I await the golden parrot’s song.

**The Immortal Who Endures Humiliation**
*For Yuan, the Clerk of Guoxian*

Beyond the world’s workings, heaven’s mysteries remain obscure,
while in the human realm, affairs never surpass this.
Though you be a hero, your rank the highest—
your body is but borrowed,
what more can greed and gluttony compel you to seek?
I eat when hungry, drink when thirsty,
my hempen robe needs no envy of brocade.
Beyond warmth and fullness, all perversity is restrained.
In the empty hall,
I recline, arm for pillow, legs stretched, sleeping clothed.

**II. Spring Rain (Two Poems)**

For years, the fields have languished in drought,
but this spring, rain and snow fall in abundance.
A clear omen—more than half the harvest is assured.
Come the time, we’ll see
a sky-reaching bounty, songs of joy filling the land.

In February, flowers bloom in patches,
a thousand willows line the embankments.
Again, they urge men to play the hero,
calling to one another,
flasks and jugs in hand, they scramble and race.

**Again**
The grace of heaven’s rain is met with universal celebration,
all living things upon the earth know no hunger.
Worry vanishes from furrowed brows.
Truly,
streets overflow, fields brim with the year’s yield.
Wine is brewed, guests are invited, songs exchanged,
feasts are laid, platters piled high.
Drunk and sated, the heart remains unshaken by foul desires.
Yet pride may overstep—
beware, for blessings may yet breed misfortune.

**III. Spring Delights**
Spring days, spring winds, spring’s beauty fair,
spring mountains, spring valleys flowing with spring waters.
Spring grasses, spring blossoms carpet the earth.
Riding spring’s momentum,
a hundred birds vie in song, contending in spring’s spirit.

The rains are rich as cream, the fields are fine,
the time of Cold Food Festival beckons for play.
Just right for flowers in bloom—
drunk through the night.
No cares to bind,
I let my jade-like form collapse, sleeping clothed.

**IV. Sensual Pleasures**
Arrogance soars to the heavens, feasting from tripods,
flutes and songs clamor, jade palaces arrayed.
Jade stirrups, flying dragons—robes and caps immaculate.
Gallantry runs wild,
unaware of the fall into the lapis lazuli well.

Slick as a thousand-fathom mirror, its walls gleam,
no path in or out where the ways cross.
Though you possess a clever, nimble nature,
your fate cannot escape—
you’ll but surrender your scalp’s shadow to him.

**V. Wondrous Use (Two Poems)**

Since ancient times, sages and worthies have followed one path,
from the very beginning, attainment arises from the heart.
Beyond this lies the land of carefree ease and peace.
No other principle—
naturally, the workings are serene and fair.

Not in toiling the spirit or tormenting the self,
but in letting go of all things, each becomes right.
Why choose the willow lanes or flower streets?
The body of emptiness
is originally one thing, without obstruction.

**Again**
Roaming the world without moving the body,
illuminating the human realm without using the heart.
Idly, I kick at the void, playing with it.
Clouds follow—
lightly gathered and released in all eight directions.

The rabbit-horn awl pierces to the bone,
the tortoise-hair whisk strikes the mountain heavy.
Sweeping away demons and spirits, leaving all empty.
A pure wind carries me—
riding the phoenix through the land of Great Peace.

**Immortal of Yellow Crane Cave**
*For Fellow Daoists*

All rush about in haste—
who will steadfastly hold fast?
North, south, east, west—all are the same,
beyond this, there is nothing more.
Wearing out iron shoes in confusion,
yet enlightenment lies not beyond the hermitage door.
When water flows, the channel forms naturally—
when the practice is complete, merit is fulfilled.

**II. Guoxian, Weinan, and the Luán Region**

This place’s scenery excels,
its people all in harmony.
Hidden among water and bamboo, dozens of households,
each knows the Mandate of Heaven.
I love the pure and empty landscape,
staff in hand, I seek secluded paths.
Each day, I wander the village once,
strolling at ease, reciting poems.

**III. Self-Portrait**

My homeland lies beyond the horizon,
a nameless scholar upon the sea.
Meeting the immortal of Zhongnan’s earth,
he brought me here to wander.
I have always loved the drifting tumbleweed,
the wild crane’s solitary cloud-like aspirations.
Straw hat on head, rain cape draped—
none know me,
yet this is the wind-madman.

**Gazing Toward Penglai**
*For Wang and Qiao, Two Disciples*

Wang Qiao’s land—
a melody most pure and fine.
Ancient paths wind and loop through water and stone,
weeping willows and eaves draped in mist and rosy clouds.
Peaches and plums interspersed with mulberry and perilla.
Within it dwell
two or three who uphold the Dao.

**On Knowing Fate**

To know fate and endure hardship with indifference,
to delight in heaven’s simplicity and frugality, never indulging in extravagance—
thus I preserve the course of my life.

**II. The Qin Plain**

The Qin Plain is fine,
a tapestry of brocade in bloom.
At sunrise after rain, the mountains gleam in beauty;
under bright moon and rushing wind, the waters sing their praise.
A thousand miles stretch boundless, pure and clear.

I have come here,
joy upon joy, beyond measure.
Heaven’s blessing in this timely ascent nurtures the Dao;
the land’s spirit and its noble people breed no evil.
From time to time, I keep company with mist and clouds.

**III. Bamboo by the Southern Stream**

Bamboo by the southern stream,
soaring in verdant splendor toward the azure void.
Upright in stem, hollow in heart—its merit yet unseen;
deep-rooted, firmly grounded—the Dao first made manifest.
How could frost and snow cause it to wither?

Do not grieve or resent,
for great vessels take time to perfect.
It bears the solitary, lofty nature of the phoenix’s perch,
and may yet transform the untrammeled into dragon form—
one day, watch it ascend beyond.

**IV. The Wanderer’s Joy**

A drifting tumbleweed,
heaven grants me the leisure of water and cloud.
When I wander at ease, time knows no sun or moon;
wherever I go, my rain cape and hat follow.
Even wind and rain bring a smile to my face.

The work of cultivation—
the earth’s axis locked with heaven’s gate.
Emerging from being, entering non-being: a three-foot sword;
eternal life, undying: a single elixir pill.
My name inscribed among the ranks of the immortals.

**The Guest by the Green Lotus Pond**

**Entering the Pass**

Feathered transformation, ascending the immortal’s path—
how should my brothers proceed?
Each must diligently cultivate awakening to life.
Traversing non-being to enter being,
in stillness, thoughts forgotten,
secretly studying the ancestral alchemical classics.

When the great calamity’s true visage is revealed,
my unbridled heart roams freely in poetic verse.
Only when merit and conduct in the world are complete
shall cloud companions and mist friends,
inviting the cool breeze and bright moon,
laughingly point the way to Penglai and Yingzhou.

**II. Secluded Dwelling**

Since parting eastward from Chang’an’s road,
I have journeyed west to the temple by Pan Stream.
Gradually, I sought the famed traces of Southern Mountain—
all faded into silence.
The vast gully lies desolate,
the earthen shrine refined,
yet I have never reached the northern abode.

Deep in the night, the path’s travelers grow still;
alone, I hear the cuckoo’s call before the cliffs.
Through the pine branches, its mournful cries persist until dawn,
each note urging:
*“Better to return—”*
Yet how can I, with so little cultivation?

**In Gratitude to the Master**

**Mocking the Bearded Monk**

**Mocking the Bearded Monk**

Neither monk nor Daoist, nor gentle in demeanor,
Unashamed before nine hundred souls.
Awakened nature transcends the dharma-realm in an instant,
Yet this body, through countless kalpas, remains my prison.
A changed face and altered guise—none can fathom,
A walking corpse with wandering bones—no cause for my sorrow.
Exultant, I forget form and return to simplicity,
Let others mock me as unrefined.

**II. Two Poems from Weinan’s Lu Creek**

**I**
A rare vista fills the river plain,
Water and bamboo curve to encircle all sides.
Clustered railings bloom with crimson flowers,
Before the gate, verdant cypresses sway gently.
Children vie in song as spring winds dance,
Spirited birds contend in skill at dawn’s tree-tops.
Thirty households dwell within the community,
Their devotion to the true Dao outshines Pan Stream.

**II**
A splendid scene renews itself daily,
Ancient cypresses stand dense in four-season spring.
This blessed land, lofty and pure, shuns worldly affairs,
The sacred altar often hosts immortal guests.
Each rejoices in being born within the Middle Kingdom,
Every household reverently honors the Perfected.
If only all gentlemen would awaken,
Together ascending the leakless realm beyond the red dust.

**III. Presented to a Daoist Friend**

Immortals drift ethereal in the Great Void’s secrecy,
The worldly have no means to glimpse them.
Fortunate to encounter an open gate of teaching,
When fasting and rites arise, do not refuse.
Burdened by family, one sins all day long,
Yet cultivating fortune and refining the heart lasts but a moment.
Should carelessness arise when the time comes,
How then to repay such boundless kindness?

**IV. Indolence**

Too lazy to read scriptures, too lazy to burn incense,
Stupefied and reeling as if drunk and mad.
Sun and moon know only rise and fall,
Right and wrong—why discern short from long?
Guests arrive, yet my heart is too weary to inquire,
Food reaches my lips, yet my mouth is too sluggish to open.
Not that I deliberately indulge this body,
But poverty and sickness have left me no cure.

**Golden Lotus Emerges from Jade Flower #8: Encountering the Teachings**

**Master Chongyang**
Long ago at Gan River, I first met him—
Master Chongyang, whose heart opened to the Great Dao.
He established teachings and journeyed east to the sea,
Turning back from the ends of the earth,
He brought three or four friends from my homeland.
When Wei Guo ascended, it startled a million households in Qin Chuan.

**II. Self-Description**

Unkempt hair, a face caked in grime,
I disregard this frame’s poverty and lowliness.
Embracing simplicity, I nurture the spirit,
Content and carefree, delighting in true nature.
Though ice-pure and jade-fair,
All must sink into the earth in the end.
Whether a Zi Yu or Pan An,
Beneath the springs, all skulls are the same.

**III. For Li Sheng of Famen Temple**

A lump of foul flesh,
For ages deluding people, never enough.
Ten thousand kinds of restless thoughts,
Six paths of ceaseless rising and sinking.
The Buddha-nature innate and true,
How can it be obscured and not reawakened?
The treasure of the immortals’ lineage,
Once enlightened, dispels your delusions.

**IV. Summer Drought**

At the height of heat,
Under a lofty sky, timely rains are absent.
A thousand miles of clear radiance,
Clouds attempt to form but are scattered by the wind.
Heaven and earth like a furnace,
All day long, scorching heat melts the air.
Creatures languish, people grow weary,
Recalling last spring’s complaints of too much rain.

**V. South Village of Western Guo**

A land of excellence,
Winding waters meander through willow-lined paths.
Everywhere, ponds and embankments,
Lotus flowers press against powdered walls.
Lofty halls and grand mansions,
Each household like a painted screen.
Towering peaks and soaring ridges,
Day by day, clouds descend with auspicious omens.

**VI. Green Peak**

Clouds disperse, rain clears,
Revealing the Green Peak’s cold, bony majesty.
Wilds still, heavens vast,
Its towering form pierces the azure vault.
The southern stream holds no charm,
With you, I while away the scorching days.
All day I compose poems,
Not of idle sorrow, but of you alone.

**VII. To Dan Yang on Provoking Demonic Obstacles**

In Deng, Lai, Wei, and Mi,
Across the four seas, all know of the brush behind the ear.
Loving to argue, never yielding an inch,
I now walk the Dao,
Unlike before, no longer calculating gains.
Let go of strength and weakness,
For now, no brush remains behind my head.

**Awakening from Southern Branch #9: Two Poems**

**I. Offering Chrysanthemums at the Lower Prime Festival for Master Qiao**

White dew marks the end of autumn’s third month,
Clear frost arrives in the tenth.
All flowers wither in desolate decay,
Only the Double Ninth’s splendor stands tall.
Resplendent and lovable,
Its fragrance must not be wasted.
Everyone adorns their heads with clusters,
I ask Master Qiao—
Have you pinned even a single stem?

**II**
Resplendent golden elixir,
Light and graceful as a white jade branch.
The Double Ninth lingers at the Lower Prime,
Offering rites to the stellar officials,
Specially presented to the true master.
Petitions ascend to the Three Heavens’ Lord,
Voices reach the Nine Earths’ overseers.
Life and death, blessings and fortune, are subtly bestowed,
The Great Dao’s vast grace,
Also entrusted to those who leave the household.

**II. Presented to Pei Manzi**

A boundless world of dust,
A fluttering, illusory body.
The heart within never understands even a moment,
Yet recklessly it rushes,
Stumbling through rugged paths.
Enticed, the inner elixir is ruined,
Worn thin, the inner organs grow hollow.
Sorrow, calamity, and suffering entwine,
A hundred remedies, a thousand methods—
None can cure.

**Refining Cinnabar #10: Presented to Zhou Daoquan of Western Guo**

Abide by your lot, do not force ambition.
Pass the days in leisure,
Content with heaven’s decree, enduring solitude.

**All Matters**

Let all matters of success or failure rest,
The path ahead stretches on, unyielding.
Loss is but emptiness from the start,
What then is gain?
A hundred years pass in but a moment’s turn.
Not so for one whose heart holds fast to the Dao’s thought—
Sage and saint lend their aid.

**Clear Heart Mirror #11: Two Poems**
*Admonishing the Taking of Life*

Among the ten thousand spirits, humans are most noble,
Transcending all, ranked among the Three Powers’ station.
Yet fools indulge in cruelty and folly,
Taking life as mere play.
They never consider the hells,
Layer upon layer of dark reckoning.
When the great limit arrives at last,
They shall answer for their deeds.

*Again*

Ghosts and spirits seize them, lash and force them to kneel.
Eyes open in dread, they strain to devise clever schemes.
Yet the Mirror of Karma hangs high above—
How can they hide from their foes?
Tongues torn out, hearts carved out to sate vengeance,
Nothing like the old days of fragrant feasts.
Through the Three Ways they suffer a hundred torments,
Rebirth as human? Not yet.

**II. Presented to a Certain Strong Elder Among the Offering Assembly, Stricken with Choking Sickness**

When setting up the feast for rites, take heed—
Do not heap dish upon dish in lavish display.
The intent was to seek blessings and grace,
Yet you invite misfortune and calamity instead.
Old Master Strong—do you see now?
Was it not indulgence,
Excess upon the body?
Now, though a hundred delicacies lie before you,
Your eyes can only watch as you choke on spittle.

**Jade Brazier and Three Streams of Snow #12**
*Advising Fellow Daoist Yang Against Voyaging to the Sea*

Most bitter are winter’s ice and snow,
Harder still to bear the winds and dust of ten thousand miles.
From the ends of the earth to the edge of the sea, you never leave the self—
Where then can you seek the seal of the heart’s unity?
Moreover, the inner elixir turns and shifts,
While you vainly chase external scenes.
How much better to keep company through the spring,
Watching my comings and goings near and far.

*II. Diligence*

Though beyond the world the truth is clear,
Heaven’s heart remains unyielding, its depths unseen.
Trudging east and west on dusty paths,
You but mimic the floating life’s dream.
Dreaming, you toil for years,
Passing three winters in mountain caves.
Wait for the message of true emptiness to appear—
Then shall the rainbow bridge rise into the clouds.

*III. Two Poems: Self-Reflection*

At night, lodging in an ancient temple by Fan Stream,
At dawn, climbing a bamboo path through a deserted village.
At midday, wandering door to door, hungry,
Begging a simple meal.
I do not delve deeply into the workings of creation,
But drift with fate through dawn and dusk.
All talk of right and wrong, self and other, I abandon—
Returning to the primal chaos before birth.

*Again*

One nature shines forth, suddenly revealed,
The Two Modes blend in their first fusion.
Lightly I roam the Dharma-realm, east or west,
Everywhere the divine radiance enfolds me.
A thousand cold springs cascade over my crown,
Auspicious mists rise in the eight directions.
Joyfully I ascend alone to the ninefold heavens,
Watching the floating life dream on.

*IV. Two Poems: Evening Scenes*

The bright sun sinks beyond distant ridges,
A gentle breeze rises from the southern peaks.
My carefree spirit soars, my mood refreshed,
Blowing away sorrow and worldly cares.
Gradually the moon of the heart unfurls,
Its faint light piercing the spirit’s terrace.
Clear and still, unstained by dust,
It gleams beyond the azure heavens.

*Again*

The sun sets, wind stirs in the ancient cave,
Deep night, the moon shines on the cold pool.
The autumn hues are limpid, mists and vapors pure,
Alone I play with the round, luminous mirror.
Recognizing the wondrous essence of the heart’s field,
I rebuke the world’s greed and craving.
Content, I lie in the mountain valley beneath pines,
Willing to wear coarse cloth and eat plain fare.

**Telling of Innermost Feelings: Two Poems Written After the Ninth Day**

Scattered frosted leaves swirl in flight,
The season has passed the Double Ninth.
Chrysanthemums bloom riotously by the railing,
Still exhaling their pure fragrance.
Autumn ages, nights grow long,
The Dao’s mood flourishes.
Clouded hermitage, entering samadhi in the Dharma-realm,
Wandering immortals, unmoved by desolation.

*Again*

A lone city, the cold horn’s notes drift,
Wind carries them into the slanting sun.
The pond’s lotuses have lost their color,
But the orchid’s marsh still holds lingering scent.
Short are the autumn days, long the evening sky,
The moon’s brilliance waxes.
Empty and still, vast and bright,
A heart of pure coolness.

**II. Scenery**

The scenery of Chang’an is wondrous through the ages,
Yet few know the Way.
Heaven’s heart and earth’s lungs are in perfect accord,
Life and death turn on the pivot of the mechanism.
Spiritual beings flourish, jade mushrooms grow plump,
Rainbows arch across the sky.
Gazing from the mountain’s height,
The Three Rivers overawe all beneath heaven.

**Untying Karmic Knots #13: Presented to the Offering Assembly**

The rivers and mountains are settled,
Weapons laid down, no war arises.
In this time of great peace,
The eight directions are harmonious and just.

**Frequent Offerings and Rituals**

Frequent offerings and rituals are held,
Abundantly repaying heaven and earth’s boundless grace.
Gratitude for the cessation of floods,
And for the compassion and kindness within.
A once-in-a-millennium encounter,
When immortals descend to the world.
Fortunate to have met this time—
Do not treat it lightly.
Offerings are made with utmost reverence,
Each year surpassing the last.
On auspicious days,
Let all sink into intoxication.

**II. Self-Reflection**

When first I sought the Dao,
I refined myself in emptiness,
My resolve soaring to the heavens,
Unmatched among mortals.
Roaming free in mountains and forests,
Later wandering clouds and waters.
Passing through Yi Gate,
Then arriving in Qin’s land.
Like a tumbleweed for a decade,
Journeying ten thousand miles.
Crossing passes and fords,
Through rugged and distant paths.
All affairs now familiar,
Yet once enlightened,
All is cast aside.
Simply following fate,
Clad in coarse robes and straw sandals.

**III. Seeking Sustenance**

One day in the north, one day in the south,
East and west alike—
Four directions, days intertwined.
In dreamlike torpor,
Coming and going,
Passing time in wandering.
Awaiting the day
When the heart of the Dao unfolds.
A century is but a fleeting scene,
How many days in all?
Silently counting,
Today and tomorrow.
Unnoticed, the counting leads
To the day of sages’ glad tidings.
When the grotto-heavens open—
That shall be my day of return.

**Roaming in Alchemy #14: Travels**

Clouds and waters drift, chanting beyond the mundane,
Sipping the nectar of stillness in drunken reverie.
The immortal’s livelihood—
The heart of a Daoist.
Easily yielding, unwilling to quarrel over trifling breath,
Ordinary in bearing, hoarding not a single coin of gold.
In pure poverty and gentle weakness,
Misfortune cannot invade.

**II. Sheltering from Heat in an Earthen Chamber**

The immortal’s abode runs deep, ancient pines verdant,
Cold shadows dense, brushing lightly over moss.
Desolate yet refreshing all day,
The mind at ease.
The grotto’s coolness oblivious to the heat beyond its gate,
The heart untroubled, the belly alone aware of clarity.
In such attainment,
The body is as pure as layered ice.

**III. Retreat from the Dao**

Sword trees, blade mountains—snow-bright edges cross,
A thousand torments, a hundred tortures, death yet life reborn.
A single dawn’s cry, blood streaming—how bitter the climb.
Needles pierce the flesh, still the pain lingers,
Steel blades flay the nature—how could it not ache?
Why then, in wanton abandon, forsake cultivation?

**Roaming in the Leakless #15: Delighting in the Dao**

Last year’s grain,
This year’s wheat—
The land swells like clouds, brimming full.
Years of plenty, an age of peace,
The common folk at ease.
Hearts content, leisure unbound,
Everywhere carefree, untroubled.
Hungry, they seek shelter;
Weary, they beg for a meal—
No village, no lane turns them away with scorn.

**II. Autumn Clearing**

The setting sun glows red,
Autumn waters grow still—
Rain passed, the azure sky like a mirror.
Hedge chrysanthemums bloom,
Border geese return,
The broad fields’ leaves scatter in flight.
Ascend the western hills,
Sip from the northern sea,
Drunken, the spirit roams the immortal realms.
Frost-chilled night, moonlight pure—
Bemused, the intoxication lingers, unshaken.

**III. The Borrowed Body**

A clot of pus,
A breath of three inches—
Used, yet no more than a puppet’s guise.
Boasting of form,
Strutting in vanity—
None willing to cease.
Skin of white jade,
Faces rouged and powdered,
All mere adornments of fleeting splendor.
Flesh rots, blood dries—
Go, gaze upon the wild wastes.

**Roaming Freely #16: Two Poems for Daoist Friends**

Seeds of good sown in the past,
This life’s blessed ground.
The Void responds—
Celestial perfected ones lend their guard.

**Expounding the Dao and Transforming Through Ritual**

Altars opened to propagate transformation,
Grace bestowed for universal salvation.
Each month, within its span,
Three assemblies are convened.
On the appointed day, summon one another—
At the hour, none may shirk.
Ride the fast, let the heart wander in play.

At home, lacking sufficiency,
Brows forever knit in care—
Thus half a fleeting life is spent.
Yet stealing moments of leisure amid the bustle,
Seek meaning before the master’s gaze,
Far surpassing blind pursuit of ignorance.

From dawn till dusk, clinging to life without cease,
One claims, “I’ve lived this life for others.”
Even if wild ambition and cunning wit
Are marshaled in manifold schemes to build a household,
With heirs to rely on and gold and pearls in endless store,
Still, in the end, what compares to the spirit’s withering?

**Remembering the Peach Blossom Source: Two Poems in Reply to Dan Yang**

The Void shines bright as a mirror,
Every weak and strong point meets its response.
Chasing after it like shadow follows form—
The slightest error, and it corrects you.

Others’ slander is but empty flattery,
Distant paths’ wild words lack proof.
Warn those who come after: do not heed them,
Silently follow the worthy and sage.

**#17: Two Poems on Deluded Longing**

**I.**
Alone, I sit by the southern stream,
One thing I cannot do—
A hundred things I do not know.
What I love appears in the misty rain’s wake:
East or west,
Clouds part to reveal emerald peaks in ranks.

**II.**
Bones as pale as the Great Void,
A chill radiance glows, catching the sunlight in flight.
Why does the heart never tire of gazing?
Forgetting to return,
As if a sickness has seeped into the marrow.

**Again**

After parting from an old friend, the idle chant ends,
In solitude by Cloud Creek, free and untrammeled.
Beneath the shadow of a hundred-foot lone pine,
Alone, I cast the Zhou Tian hexagrams.

Pure wind and bright moon, though priceless,
Even the finest hand and wondrous craft cannot paint them.
Should I boast of them to the world,
Who could discern the true from the false?

**III.**
Amid the tangled grasses, I crouch alone,
Drumming my belly, I sing at ease in idle leisure.
A pillow’s wandering immortal dream now broken—
Yet my face remains glad,
Laughing and roaming where green peaks resound.

At noon, I unbolt the wicker gate,
Leaping and lingering to gaze at distant mountains.
Below the peaks, someone comes to ask the Dao—
I know it’s hard.
Leaping again, wordless, I laugh and turn away.

**Penglai Pavilion**
*Immortal Mountains*

Penglai’s towers—
Vast, vast, the mighty sea, deep and hard to cross.
Deep and hard to cross—
Raging waves surge and roar,
Angry breakers churn like snow.

On the eastern edge of Jade Empyrean, I’ve heard it said,
There lies a realm of emptiness, by nature set apart.
By nature set apart—
The Mount of the Great Turtle stands unmoved,
Mirage towers endure unbroken.

---

**II. Deluded Thoughts**

A sojourner of rosy clouds,
I wander west and lodge beside South Stream.
Beside South Stream—
A thousand fathoms of crimson cliffs,
Ten thousand trunks of verdant cypress.

My heart is empty—only pale clouds drift white,
I lift my head but see no hue of splendor.
No hue of splendor—
Vain blossoms scatter in confusion,
While the world clings to greed.

---

**Burning Heart Incense**
*Two Poems on Cultivating the Dao*

**I.**
The Great Dao has no form—
How can the square inch of the heart rely on it?
Yet in every person, wisdom and insight shine bright.
To subdue the host of desires,
To untangle the tangle of passions—
Be tranquil amid clamor,
Still amid busyness,
Clear amid turbidity.

Like an infant in disposition,
Like ice in embrace—
Once the cocoon is rent,
The former path is seen.
My words are utmost counsel,
Listen deeply with your ears.
Exert full effort,
Full resolve,
And full accomplishment.

**II.**

**II.**
When wild geese turn homeward,
The chrysanthemums blaze in the wilds.
I crouch by deep streams,
In ancient caves winding.
Solitary chanting in stillness,
Alone refining the returning elixir.
Yet night falls desolate,
The cave cramped,
Sitting in hardship.

One nature scattered,
Years spent lingering—
Only now does the cause and condition reveal itself.
Jade pearls reach the earth,
The moon of treasure pierces the heavens.
Thus I emerge, luminous,
Forgetting schemes,
Free from toil and strife.

---

**Two Self-Chants on Delayed Beginnings**

**I.**
A drifting idler, born a Qiu,
Dwelling in the east—
Dengzhou on the eastern road.
From youth, I severed the net of worldly ties,
Following my master west in wanderings.
Unfettered, adrift,
Like a lone leaf on the long river.
Let the red dust burn bright as day—
I drift with the clouds, untroubled.

**II.**
A carefree body beyond the world,
Like a wisp of idle cloud in the blue sky.
Let empty space bring forth auspicious signs—
I remain unstained by the slightest dust.
Roaming the eight directions of heaven,
I meet the three luminaries—
Sun, moon, and stars.
In stillness, no worldly affairs arise,
Only companionship as my neighbor.

---

**Cloud Brook Reflects the Moon of the Heart: On Qiao’s Loss of His Wife**
Yin and yang shift,
Eternal as the ages.
Gain and loss are but fleeting moments—
Why cling to joy in life,
Or dread in death?

**On Life and Death**
Life and death, long and short years—
all within a hundred springs.
Turn and gaze:
Behold Mount Bei Mang,
where mounds rise in endless rows,
all alike.

The body is but a borrowed dwelling,
the nature a transient guest.
Where lies the true homeland?
Yet the six paths turn ceaselessly,
driven by fate’s whip.

Awakened, lay all down,
free from toil and torment.
No kin, no need to grieve for others—
guard only your own steps.

---

**Leaving the Sea of Suffering**
*For Zhou Daoquan of Xiguo*

I know your heart has long admired the good,
yet how can one shed the dust of fleeting splendor?
Though you wish to drift like tumbleweed,
your feet remain bound by worldly cords.

Swiftly the sun and moon race overhead—
take care not to squander time in vain.
The Dao of immortals lies close at hand,
but alas, the human heart remains unenlightened.

---

**Spring in Wuling**
*For Yang Wusheng of Weinan’s Birthday*

The new year has just begun,
all things stir to life,
as the season nears the Lantern Festival.
Auspicious mist descends from azure skies—
a celestial scion is born.

His bearing is noble, surpassing all in wit,
turning to the Dao, weary of worldly clamor.
Though rocks crumble and pines wither,
his years stretch far beyond—
tortoise and crane alike outlived.

---

**Roaming Clouds and Waters**
*Self-Reflection*

Stay—stay.
Dwell by the emerald cliffs,
free from schemes and cares.
I know my share is meager, my ties light,
and thus I remain obscure.

A fleeting phantom, I hide my name,
grasping at the passing seasons.
With the bold folk of Panxi’s shores,
I weave bonds of wonder and delight.

---

**Far-Reaching Gaze**
*For the Daoist Friends of Weinan’s Rite During Drought*

For nine summers, the heavens parch,
all things wither in the scorching heat.
This stems from the human heart,
which breeds needless strife.

Fine robes and sleek horses,
parading in grand processions,
while young and old waste their days
gathering in every village.

The petty cannot discern right from wrong,
yet Heaven judges high and low.
Our hearts differ—
why do their aspirations drift so aimlessly?

Awaken to sincerity, cultivate the fast,
chant the good through passing years.
I hope the Perfected will lift us,
empty-handed, in their embrace.

---

**Crows Crying at Night**
*A Warning Against Washing the Face*

Alas, the ways of the world—
people indulge their desires without restraint.
They speak of human nature,
spending their days in vanity.

Yin and yang reverse,
heaven and earth rise and fall.
Fortune fades, calamity comes—
how can sorrow be endured?

The year barely passes,
the belly’s hunger just sated,
yet they wash their faces, rinse their veins,
still chasing lust and greed.

Those without foresight
plant deep roots of disaster.
Before misfortune sprouts,
who understands the need for vigilance?

---

**Congratulations to the Sage at Dawn**
*A Still Night*

The setting sun sinks,
the ridges swallow the last light,
cypress and mist lock in cold.
By the southern stream, I sit alone,
listening to the wind carry
a cascade of murmuring springs.

Through the long night,
affairs fade, the spirit at ease,
I pluck the stringless zither.
When the azure bird descends with omens,
I shall prove myself a divine immortal
upon this earth.

---

**No Dreams Command**
*Against Extravagance*
*Two Poems*

People of the Shaanxi region, heed me:
in this blessed land, cultivate good karma.
Nowhere under heaven compares—
rich and poor alike walk the same path.

Beware—beware—
beware of excessive pride.

In the famine years of Huangtong,
ten thousand households knit their brows in sorrow.
Mouths open, yet no food—
tears fall like scattered pearls.

**Disaster, Disaster**

Disaster, disaster—
how to flee when calamity descends?
