**Preface to *The Radiant Divine Light of Danyang***

To seek the Dao afar while it lies near, to treat the easy as difficult—such is the common tendency of the world. Yet to perceive it with the eye and preserve it in the heart, to comprehend without words—this is the aspiration of the superior person, and indeed, Master Danyang has attained it.

With the clarity of one awakened before others, the Master illumined the ignorant and guided the dull-witted. For those who lagged behind, he further pointed the way. Truly, it was like the bright moon streaming across the heavens, revealing all things in brilliant clarity; or a lamp of the heart within the body, dispelling heat and affliction with cool relief.

The Master also composed *The Radiant Divine Light*, one hundred verses in all, that they might be sung, expounded, and mutually exhorted. Alas! The Master’s compassion for transforming others runs deep, his concern for humanity weighs heavily. Is he not like the bodhi tree of wisdom, casting its pure shade over countless sands; or the divine elixir of prajñā, rescuing the weary from the sea of suffering?

I humbly offer these unpolished words to preface its beginning.

Respectfully inscribed on the Double Ninth Day of the *yiwei* year of the Dading era,
by Ning Shichang, the Rustic Recluse of Junxi.

**"Full Garden Fragrance #1: Establishing the Gate Within"**

Within the gate, uphold the Gate of Perfect Realization,
its pure and tranquil root-source.
In dwelling, walking, sitting, lying—return to the Origin.
In daily use, seize the moment to capture
the galloping mind-steed and the restless heart-monkey.
Ever act without hatred or attachment,
bestowing kindness first, then dissolving old grievances.
At the outset, refine and mend with harmonious qi,
tending the garden of leaky flaws.

Deep in auspicious mist and luminous radiance,
gather the spirit-water, letting it slowly submerge and flow.
Though the crimson brocade snake be small,
heed the idle gaze of the numinous turtle.
When the two merge into one,
the primal moon of original nature appears, full and round.
At that moment, bow to Master Chongyang of Taiyuan.

**"Vows and Precepts Beyond the Written Pledge"**

Burn the written pledge in earnest,
solemnly utter the oath,
and obey the laws of the land above all.
Seeing men and women alike,
regard parents with the same reverence.
Forever renounce qi, wealth, wine, and lust;
forsake glory, abandoning the stench of fish and mutton.
Ever maintain purity,
with humility, harmony, reverence, and care—
no factions, no bias.

Live plainly, enduring cold and hunger,
and when need arises, beg with outstretched hands in the streets.
Do not covet wealth or speak deceit,
feigning lofty wisdom.
Always hold fast to caution, as at the beginning;
when peril comes, steel the heart even more.
Should you retreat from the Way,
may your body be sundered ten thousandfold,
eternally bound in the Yellow Springs.

**Before Master Chongyang’s Ascension in Rosy Clouds**

Master Chongyang met the Perfected Lü,
who nurtured the spirit within his spirit.
His heart ceaselessly stirred with compassion,
unfolding good causes.
Ever he projected his spirit into dreams,
transforming others, guiding them from the sea of delusion.

At Beihai in Dengzhou, a cloth-robed king once appeared,
his body soaring above the sea.
The towering talent of the Gao clan at Huabiao,
in the eastern outskirts of Dongmou, sometimes revealed his true form.
Once he shared wine with Needle Li of Nanjing,
and opened the jar in the Central Capital.
Even when his phantom body still lived,
he manifested thus, again and again.
How much more now,
having shed the cicada’s husk,
he eternally claims everlasting spring.

**After Master Chongyang’s Ascension in Rosy Clouds**

Master Chongyang,
foretelling Nanjing’s fate,
indeed journeyed to Penglai and Yingzhou.
He cast off the four borrowed mortal frames,
his true nature ascending in transcendence.
By the Xunyi Bridge he appeared,
urging Minister Zang to begin cultivation early.
His teachings proclaimed:
Life and destiny are paramount,
while fame and profit must cease.

There was also Great Xue of Danzhou,
who met him once on Zhongnan Mountain—
truly, distinctly.
Liu, Jiang, and Elder Zhang obtained the elixir,
their bodies hale and sound.
West of Kunming Pool, people saw him,
dancing lightly in the void,
sleeves swaying.
Having attained the Dao,
he became an immortal,
enjoying long life and eternal vision.

**In Eulogy for Master He’s Passing**

Master He,
awakening to the good cause,
resigned his post, returned his seal, and relinquished power.
Far from the world, beneath Zhongnan Mountain,
he built a hut of thatch and rafters.
Clad in hempen robes and paper coats,
he delighted in tranquility,
laughing freely amidst forests and springs.
Cherishing the jade within,
he concealed his light and withdrew,
for over twenty years.

Why did Mountain Hermit serve him?
Meeting Wind Immortal,
he spoke of living immortals.
Truly, his passing was extraordinary,
his chamber filled with auspicious mist.
After years, suddenly in the void,
he left behind painted verses of fishing.
He admonished me:
Lest I lose sight of the truth,
never boast of mysteries.

**To Dharma Master Wang of Xianyang**

Mountain Hermit entered the Dao,
leaving his nest far behind,
wholeheartedly—how resolute!
He vowed to extinguish fire and dissipate smoke,
preserving harmonious qi.
Who knew that lodging briefly,
a slight discord would stir winds and waves?
His merit and conduct harmed,
arising from ignorance and pettiness,
he was mocked in verse.

Suddenly recalling his past vows,
he compared himself to
oxen, donkeys, horses, and mules.
With no way to undo,
he emulated Lian Po.
Humbly bearing the bramble to apologize,
he begged his master:
Beat me severely!
Through refinement,
lest his true nature
meet Yama again.

**Letter to Lord Yao**

Mountain Hermit bows,
since parting from Immortal Yao,
each day feels like a year.
Yet this clear, clearing rain
irrigates the fields of magic mushrooms.
I trust your divine wisdom remains aligned,
dwelling in serenity,
your dharma body at ease.
Your kindness endures,
as ever, with remembrance,
exchanged through letters.

I humbly offer these few words,
as Immortal Tan departs,
inviting you on crane’s wings.
If you visit upon clouds of light,
my gratitude would be beyond words.
A trifling matter in leisure,
awaiting your arrival,
I shall express all in person.
Mountain Hermit bows,
before the Jade Seat of the Mysterious within the Mysterious.

**Letter to Lord Dong of Horse-Running Street**

Mountain Hermit bows,
Lord Dong, mighty in the Dao,
three years since our last discourse.
My thirst for virtue
cannot be fully expressed by brush or tongue.
I trust of late your dharma demeanor
grows ever more harmonious,
dwelling in ease without hindrance.
Now you
abide within your walled garden, nurturing simplicity,
spare your teeth the recounting.

Fortunately, a favorable breeze passes,
carrying my wild verses and this letter,
to convey a single message.
Time marches on, returning like flowing water.
Swiftly attend to life and destiny,
with utmost sincerity—
pray forgive my presumption.
Mountain Hermit bows,
to Lord Dong, mighty in the Dao,
and all fellow Dao companions.

**To Liu Shouchu**

The Daoist livelihood—
speak little of it,
for nothing surpasses tranquility.
Free from clinging attachments,
worldly affairs cannot disturb.
Roaming freely amidst water and clouds,
east or west, as the sun and moon shuttle.
Delight in travel,
staff in hand, sandals on feet,
hat on head, straw cloak draped.

Whether at the edge of the sea or sky’s end,
whirling about,
drunk and singing wildly.
Outwardly carefree,
inwardly nurturing harmonious qi.
Once the divine elixir is refined,
radiant rosy clouds
will shine in myriad hues.
Then,
pay homage to Wind Immortal,
ascending straight to the Great Canopy.

**To Nobleman Zhu and Secretary Zhang**

Gentlemen, heed me:
Within the capital’s furnace,
there is also Penglai and Yingzhou.
Five-colored rosy clouds rise and fall,
ascending and descending in flight.
Recognizing the livelihood of water and clouds,
no need to labor
with foot or force.
Secure life and destiny,
passing through all things—
what idle strife remains?

Put others before self,
guard purity,
nurturing the single luminous point.
Responding to phenomena with true constancy,
moving or still, at peace.
Once merit is complete and conduct perfected,
go to court the origin,
body light as cloud-steps.
Truly enlightened,
like Master Chongyang,
neither perishing nor born.

**To Lord Cuan**

Unkempt hair, a face smeared with grime,
secret mysteries concealed in obscurity,
nurturing spirit, cultivating qi, forgetting form.
Not a speck of dust clings,
mind serene, heart clear.
Carefree and naturally joyful,
grasping the mystery,
advancing toward long life.
In tranquility,
how much better than the fiery courtyard,
the bitter sea of karmic debt.

Sleeping beneath the moon, resting on clouds,
playing with the Dipper,
commanding dragon and tiger, infant and maiden.
Directing the flight of gold, the flow of jade,
in profound obscurity.
A single point of numinous light comes and goes,
revealing the primal origin,
body light in wondrous form.
Riding the phoenix,
pointing toward Penglai’s path,
marching onward.

**To Magistrate Quan**

Why sever profit?
Why forget fame?
Once you beheld the true forms of the Five Peaks.

The nature of jade is like a pearl, like a seal—
brilliant, radiant, luminous.
Once this borrowed form is seen through,
the heart turns to ash,
no more toiling in this life.
Seek the path,
lest that single point of numinous light
fall into the pit of delusion.
Sever the threads of clinging love,
search the mysteries,
grasp something from the void as proof.
Still, clear, profound,
in silent obscurity.
When the work is done—seven returns, nine revolutions—
don the immortal’s robe,
crane feathers light.
Journey toward the origin,
pointing to the jade terrace, the cloud-palace of Langyuan.

**To Masters Luo, Liu, and Shi**

Gentlemen who study the Dao,
do not pursue the strange,
be without action, without contention, without rivalry.
Within the hundred non-songs, four lines,
a gatha to uphold the precepts.
Body and mind like wood carved, clay molded,
encountering a thousand demons, ten thousand hardships—heed them not.
Be ever patient,
ever patient, ever enduring,
patient, enduring, enduring.

Penetrate the Dao of observing heaven,
grasp the celestial motion,
the crucial pivot where harmony naturally arises.
Abide always in the true and constant,
always responsive,
always still, always present.
Truly constant, truly joyful, truly blissful,
manifesting true suchness,
transcending the three realms.
Truly indestructible,
truly indestructible, indestructible, indestructible.

**To Registrar Duan, Instructor Sun, and Daoist Friends**

Gentlemen who study the Dao,
lend your ears to my words,
as if they were a thousand household ties.
Consider those who walk the pole, tread the rope,
race horses, sail boats.
Have they ever spoken of toil or bitterness?
Facing hardship,
turn after turn, the heart grows firm.
Forget danger,
forget the body, forget life,
forget what comes after, forget what came before.

Pay no heed to the cold sneers of others,
cherish the ground,
ever cautious, ever single-minded.
Though you were Su Qin or Lu Jia,
none could sway your shoulders.
If one can turn toward the Dao like this,
searching for the true, the wondrous, the mysterious,
there is nothing one will not awaken to—
what worry then of not becoming an immortal?

**To Wang Zhixuan**

Behold Sun in shackles and chains,
wife and concubines at war,
that clever, sharp-witted demon of delusion.
The ant-horn, fly-head names and profits,
favor and disgrace—so many shocks.
Pondering the shoes and slippers by the bed,
when morning comes,
what will the affairs of the season be?
Preserving life and fate,
how can one night be secured?
What is there to strive for?

Better to keep company with Shan Tong and Ma Yu,
beneath the pine peak,
carefree, drunk, dancing, singing wild.
On the knee, a lute plays "Green Jade,"
tuning the pattern of harmony.
In the crucible, the great elixir is nurtured,
the embryonic immortal appears,
dancing sleeves swirling.
At that time,
bow to the wind immortal and ascend to Great Luo.

**To Messrs. Zang, Liu, and Shi, Who Presented a Stone Ram Seeking a Poem**

Moving mountains, lifting tripods,
shooting tigers, piercing poplars—
none compare to the fate of the azure ram.
Awakening to the mystery within mystery,
vast and boundless.
Naturally like one drunk or mad,
far from human sentiments,
wind and harm run wild.
Within these four walls,
conceal your light, hide your traces—
how could you seek fame?

I only wish that all people were like me,
holding the cloud-water way within,
roaming freely as they please.
Metal and wood flow with the waves,
fire’s fate blazes.
Then tiger and dragon wage war,
spitting the divine pearl,
crystallizing the true sun.
At that time,
mount the cloud chariot and return,
together paying homage to Chongyang.

**To Xu Daoyuan**

Fiercely cast off the sea of the vulgar,
single-minded in turning toward the mystery,
with the Complete Perfection’s purity and stillness as foremost.
In the heart, no thoughts, no worries,
no factions, no bias.
From the void, gain some refined delight,
guard poverty,
passing days according to conditions.
By natural principle,
from ancient times to now,
few have spoken of this.

Only the descendants of the divine Xi,
able to bear the task,
within the body naturally complete and perfect.
The divine turtle at the sea’s bottom,
divine mouth, divine breath, divine spring.
The numinous light once more sprays the crimson palace,
congealing the golden elixir,
a fresh pearl.
Without birth or extinction,
with Shan Tong, together bow to the wind immortal.

**To Master Song**

Do not boast of present nobility,
do not gallop in glory and splendor—
the impermanence of things is pressing, worthy of sighs.
Do not learn the cloud-gut red tally,
the shackles of profit, the yoke of fame.
Better to follow the wind immortal in awakening to the Dao,
abandoning family ties,
the immortal’s path without error.
With a steadfast will,
refine the mortal heart like jade,
cutting away every speck of flaw.

Passing days only by begging,
simple and artless,
carefree in the cloud-water life.
Always abiding, always pure, always still,
always nurturing the yellow sprout.
From the void, the work is completed—nine revolutions—
the embryonic immortal appears,
holding the numinous sand in the palm.
At that time,
with Shan Tong, step together into the mist and clouds.

**To Little Immortal Zhang**

Beneath the pine peak,
leisurely sipping the elixir pellet,
offering cups of fire dates and honey pears.
Stroking the heart’s zither, phoenixes and cranes,
soaring up and down.
Tiger and dragon roar as one,
speaking of the return of
the six thieves and three corpses.
The yin demons scatter,
awakening to heaven clear, earth still,
sun and moon shining bright.

Directing the flight of golden light and jade radiance,
gathering auspicious mist and propitious qi,
congealing the true infant.
The body adorned with immortal robes and cloud shoes,
rainbow hues and cloud iridescence.
The mouth proclaims non-birth, non-extinction,
pointing to the Penglai path,
where one may return.
These,
the living practices of the Daoist,
told for others to know.

**To Master Xu of Chang’an**

First, clarify the mystery’s principle,
second, the two luminaries conjoin in the palace,
third, the three powers, four images—explore their interpenetration.
Five-colored rosy clouds come and go,
a fine rain misting.
The six desires, seven emotions—washed clean,
the eight thoroughfares flow,
revolving the returning wind.
Within the nine orifices,
tenfold inversion—
the true work manifests.

The ten poles, clear and empty,
the ninefold gates open wide,
gold and jade layered within.
In the eight-jeweled lapis cave,
tiger sleeps, dragon rests.
Seven-treasure flowers bloom in six directions,
at the center of the five directions,
the four positions return to the origin.
The three lights shine,
the two modes follow one another,
a single divine elder.

**To Senior Brother Jiang**

Holding the work, sitting in meditation,
bowing to earth, chanting verses,
eating rosy clouds, fasting, reading scriptures.
Talisman water, focused visualization,
gargling, swallowing—laboring the form.
Many are deluded by the arts of the bedchamber,
taking the return to the origin,
water and fire as proof.
Yet do not blame
these various practices—
they err in cultivation.

If you awaken to the great Dao of non-action,
cut off clinging love, thoughts of attachment,
joy, anger, worldly emotions,
the mind still, the heart clear, essence secret,
qi congealed, spirit concentrated.
Naturally, nature halts, life abides,
arising in true compassion,
merit and practice both perfected.

**The Golden Lad’s Edict**

Then, riding clouds astride a phoenix,
you shall ascend to Penglai and Yingzhou.

**To All Daoist Friends**

Clinging to beauty and wealth,
stuck fast as lacquer and glue—
how can you ever be clear and unentangled?
Worse still, the snare of fame remains unbroken,
the lure of profit unshaken.
All day long, you fret for sons and daughters,
yet when have you ever briefly raised your brow?
In the fiery household,
you trap your body,
roasted and scorched.

If you awaken to the urgency of impermanence,
casting aside love and worldly ties
with fierce resolve,
then beyond the dust, life and nature roam free—
this is true fellowship.
In daily practice, the heart is clear, the mind still,
watching cloud-waves and dragon-tiger roars.
The radiance of spirit shines,
revealing your original face—
even heaven and earth cannot contain it.

**To Duke Du of Xingping**

Stars shift, the Dipper turns,
the four seasons cycle—
yet no one pauses to ponder.
Unawares, the babe becomes an old man,
having tasted wine, beauty, anger, and wealth.
Now is the time to still the heart,
now is the time to let go.
Turn your head,
return to the primal matter,
and swiftly bring it to completion.

I urge you: act swiftly,
lest Yama’s unpredictable summons
dispatch ghosts to call you.
Join Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma
as companions beyond the world.
With a still mind and clear heart,
you tread the path—
this is the other shore of immortality.
The radiance of spirit shines,
riding the green luan bird back,
beyond heaven and earth’s reach.

**Exhortation to Daoist Friends**

Cherishing wives and concubines,
worrying for sons and daughters,
a single heart tangled in a thousand threads.
Chasing fame, competing for profit,
when do you ever pause?
Like bees gathering nectar to make honey—
who savors the sweetness
while you alone bear the toil?
Bewildered,
like moths flying into flame,
what a grand, foolish end.

**Addressed to the Venerable Father Laozi**

In the fiery pit,
who pities you?
Each one goads the worthy with greed and love,
enjoying wealth and honor themselves.
When death comes, no one will take your place.
Turn back swiftly,
awaken at once.
Return beyond the world,
abide in non-action and purity—
this is the immortal’s path.

**To Sun Keda of Lingkou**

This illusory body,
walking bones across hills—
what wind and glory do you chase?
The place where your parents bore you
is the very cause of your death.
I urge you: swiftly see through it,
clinging to children and grandchildren—
what end lies ahead?
Turn back early,
cast off family ties,
and cultivate truth beyond the world.

A single practice of non-action and purity
is the immortal’s secret,
the great Dao’s mechanism.
Rely on this in your conduct—
why seek beyond the body?
Naturally, mercury and lead congeal,
the ninefold cyclical elixir
completes its course in days.
The radiance of spirit shines,
riding the feathered chariot,
straight into Yingzhou.

**To Masters Jiang and Wang**

All who study the Dao
must know the sequence:
first, abandon sons and leave wives;
next, depart the home to beg for food,
practicing non-action.
When you see the old or the young,
you must first offer rites and music.
Act with great kindness,
every thought and intention
brimming with compassion.

Subdue sharpness, crush strength, endure humiliation,
cast off clinging love and attachments—
let not even a trace arise.
Then the spirit-terrace gradually brightens,
harmonizing with the Dao.
On the mountain, the red dragon coils with mercury;
in the sea, the black tiger encircles lead.
When the great elixir ripens,
point toward Penglai and Yingzhou,
riding a cloud home.

**To Zhao Baoxuan**

Embracing mystery, far from the vulgar,
unattached to glory and splendor,
content with simple flavors.
A heart at ease beyond the world,
another way of life.
In non-action and natural purity,
a subtle, wondrous achievement takes shape.
Within the cinnabar field,
it fills to overflowing—
white snow and yellow sprouts.

Within, true yang is refined,
the primal root and stem
transformed into numinous cinnabar.
When you perceive the true nature through the throat,
it is flawless as jade.
With effort fully perfected,
seek Penglai and Yingzhou,
step by step through mist and clouds.
In the void,
golden lads and jade maidens
welcome you into the immortal’s home.

**To Yao Xuanyu**

The Daoist’s livelihood:
a broad, raincoat-clad ease,
fitting for walking, sitting, resting, and sleeping.
Awakened to the joy of pure poverty,
all doubts dissolved.
Life roams free and unfettered,
wandering water and clouds
to the ends of sea and sky.
Unbound,
leisurely coming and going—
what need for refuge?

Grasping the wondrous subtleties within mystery,
dispelling the sickness of the heart,
cultivation resembles a skilled physician.
Who would believe a man could conceive?
It is beyond thought.
Qi congeals, spirit concentrates, life abides—
giving birth to an immortal embryo,
transcending the Nine Doubts.
At that time,
the radiant return to the origin reveals your countenance.

**To Master Yan**

Last night in a dream,
I fortunately met Chongyang,
who bestowed a secret immortal’s formula.
In the distant, hazy, indistinct,
Tai Bai gleamed yellow.
This is the color of the elixir pellet,
flowing back and forth,
drunk like jade nectar.
Formed into pills,
swallow one—
the eight meridians are at peace.

Wielding it, the blade grows sharper,
radiance shines,
brilliant and dazzling in the hall of light.
Frightened, demons and ghosts
flee far into hiding.
Naturally, a divine child appears,
riding the green luan bird
to ascend to Peng Manor.
This profound mystery—
let all of like mind ponder it deeply.

**To Master Yan of Huxian and the Daoist Assembly**

The mountain rustic Ma Yu,
idly chanting and singing,
does not boast of strength or talent.
Seeing people dwell in the fiery household,
enduring suffering, I cannot bear it.
Time and again, poems and verses exhort,
opening the cinnabar sincerity,
revealing the mysterious path.
I weep and plead,
hoping all will turn back,
each one heeding the call.

Sever the ropes of passion and desire,
return beyond the world—
no entanglements, no sickness, no bonds.
At ease, carefree, joyful,
cultivate and complete nature and life.
When one day merit is fulfilled and practice complete,
golden lads
will hold the shao music to invite you.
Such is the matter—
alas, no one is willing,
what have they lost?

**To Master Yu of Mount Tu**

Leisurely searching,
the sons and daughters of others—
where did they dwell before birth?
What deep kinship or love
brings you together?
They cannot replace you in life or death,
so why toil endlessly for them?
Awaken,
then swiftly break from the fire,
shake your sleeves and depart.

Wandering clouds and flowing waters at will,
no entanglements—
naturally forgetting schemes and cares.
The three-fold heart-lute stirs,
the cinnabar child and jade maiden dance.
Tiger and dragon coil as one,
forging the golden elixir,
ever deepening awakening.
Accumulate hidden virtue,
practice complete—
the true master comes to ferry you.

**To Master He of Chunhua, the Dyer**

Dyeing for others,
idly pondering,
debating rights and wrongs to test the ear.
Gathering silks and brocades to grasp,
a full steamer’s worth.
Why refine until scorched,
all for pitying their fading hues?
When the bolt is dyed,
it must still be rolled and polished,
seeking only brightness.

Scattering water and paste without end,
when someone comes to claim it,
readily acknowledge it as theirs.
Untie the knots of flaws and bonds,
and naturally see your true nature.
Just like a single move in cultivation—
without entanglements or strikes,
the true nature becomes visible.
Ever serene and still,
the radiant divine light shines steadily.

**To Master Zhang of Xingping**

Transcending to awaken to the Dao,
joyfully leaving the mundane,
how could one bear to be mired in mud and drenched in water?
Resolutely turn back,
escaping the mountain of love and prison of desire.
Worthy to be wind’s neighbor and moon’s companion,
chasing clouds as friends and rosy hues as kin.
No hindrances—
in the human realm, first to claim
the blessing of half-immortality.

Moreover, truly refining and cultivating,
attaining carefree ease,
settling the heart and dispelling desires.
Gradually sensing the fields of immortals’ herbs,
their rare fragrance rich and lush.
Where do tiger and dragon coil?
In the elixir furnace,
transforming into gold and jade.
The divine light radiant,
proceeding toward Penglai’s precious land.

**To Zhao Sanxian of Ruche**

Cease talk of coughing and swallowing,
no need to speak of visualization—
swallowing rosy clouds and breathing qi are vain.
Sitting in meditation, holding postures,
stretching limbs—all labor in vain.
Gathering and battling scatter the divine elixir,
ingesting primordial harmony—
water and fire misapplied.
The true principle lies
in effortless non-action,
most worthy of reliance.

The heart at ease, carefree and joyful,
living carefree and joyful,
ever open and unobstructed.
The spirit at peace, serene and supplied,
serene and unburdened.
Harmony naturally forms the treasure,
attaining the original,
a single point of clarity.
The divine light radiant,
revealing the original face and form.

**To Master Wang of Chen**

Carefree and at ease,
roaming like clouds and water,
the body like an untethered solitary boat.
Unfettered, unbound, ungoverned,
no joy, no sorrow.
Ever singing and dancing at will,
heedless of others’ mocking laughter.
With a poor but steadfast heart,
live by fate’s flow,
vowing never to covet.

In this world, like empty space,
like the lotus,
untouched by water’s trace.
Perform the three altars’ offerings,
cultivate the six perfections.
Naturally, the fruit ripens without flaw,
the heart serene and still,
transcending into leisurely wandering.
Bow in reverence
to the supreme honored sages,
the companions of Buddhas, Daoists, and immortals.

**[To Master Zhang]**

After Master He, the uncle, ascended in rosy clouds, there was Master Zhang of Lintong County, who ran a silk-dyeing shop. His illness lingered, incurable, until one night he dreamed of his uncle, who prescribed a remedy. Asking his name, he learned it was Master He of Zhongnan. Upon waking, he followed the prescription, and his illness healed. In the *jiawu* year, on the ninth day of the ninth month, Master Zhang personally visited his uncle’s grave to burn incense and offer thanks, erecting a stele at the pagoda. Thus, these words were composed for him.

Master He, the uncle,
after ascending in rosy clouds—
marvelous, wondrous, rare!
The dying man of Lintong,
Zhang, a fellow Daoist.
The immortal seeks no human repayment,
hoping your noble household
will awaken and turn back.
Who would have thought
you’d journey so far to the earth’s navel,
burning incense in haste?

I offer these verses to exhort:
like impermanence,
resolutely and swiftly shake your sleeves and depart.
Beyond the world, subdue the heart and cultivate,
tiger and dragon in union.
One day, practice complete,
the nine-fold elixir
naturally perfected.
The divine light radiant,
riding a phoenix to thank the master’s salvation.

**To Master Huangfu**

At the very first move,
immortal and mortal vie,
knowing each hexagram’s struggle.
Mundane intentions and hearts are strong,
like lacquer and glue.
The true heart, torn and made whole,
avoids the fiery pit,
the body roasted within.
Hold fast,
ever vigilant against stumbling,
into the wilds beyond the body.

If you awaken to impermanence’s unpredictability,
wield the sword of wisdom with firm resolve,
battling the monkey and ape.
Then the heart is clear, the intent still,
dragon and tiger roar.
Spirit and qi, pure and congealed,
the great elixir formed—
heaven bestows the immortal’s robe.
Riding the clouds,
attend the Penglai feast of peaches.

**To Master Yu of Jiu Bei**

Cease talk of a hundred years,
seventy is rare—
how much more so the unpredictable end?
Idly pondering wife, children, and self,
all are walking corpses.
The glory and splendor before your eyes
are the delusions
rooting life and nature.
If you awaken,
cast aside worldly ties,
cultivate beyond the mundane.

Cleverness turns to confusion,
with disheveled hair and grimy face,
guard the mysterious mechanism.
True breath, continuous and auspicious,
fills the lands of Hua and Yi.
To reach Penglai’s path,
rely on three thousand deeds complete,
riding the clouds home.
The divine light radiant,
joining the great immortals—
what have you lost?

**To Master Wang of Hukou**

This mountain rustic earnestly advises:
those chasing fame and profit,
seeking only wealth and security—
how could they grasp our gate’s first move,
the root cause of transcending the world?
Tiger and dragon race to the phoenix tower,
with no intermediary—
the cinnabar child and jade maiden unite.
Who would believe
there is no repentance of the mundane,
no marriage of husband and wife?

Wood and metal, threefold barriers,
use the mysterious mechanism to revolve,
blending into truth.
Suddenly, the man’s womb swells,
unnaturally divine.
Life and nature do not depend on heaven and earth,
the heart knows—
eternal spring is yours.
The divine light radiant,
riding the clouds to pay homage to Lü Dongbin.

**To Yao Yuanming**

Not relying on glory,
not clinging to wealth,
wife and children may bring resentment.
All things forgotten, single-minded,
wholeheartedly cultivating.
Heart and intent ever clear, ever still,
awakening to the pot’s
heaven unfolding, earth expanding.

Worthy of admiration,
behold the dragon coiling, the tiger encircling,
the Kan and Li palaces.
At times, the cinnabar child and jade maiden transform,
turning toward the Hall of Light,
rolling up the kingfisher-green curtains.
Amidst auspicious signs, recognize
your original countenance.
Holding the golden elixir, the great medicine,
manifesting effortless achievement—
ninefold refinement complete.
Divine light radiant,
mounting the phoenix to hasten to the jade feast.

**To the Three Elders of Sanshui County**

Resolve must be firm and steadfast,
nature ever gentle and yielding,
the heart’s monkey and intent’s horse tightly bound.
Love, desire, worldly dust, and vulgar thoughts—
all swept away together.
Matters of past and future,
seek them not, nor ponder nor measure.
Dwell beyond things,
guard pure poverty with ease,
and scorn not solitude.
Beware of sorrow over aging and decline;
if illness comes,
let joy arise within the heart.
When frailty nears life’s end,
cling not to appearances.
Ever abide in true constancy, without companion,
attaining numinous clarity—
naturally resplendent.
Divine light radiant,
assuredly carefree and unbound,
ascending to the azure heavens.

**To Master Yan of Ninghai**

Subdue the heart in one move,
with some method and discipline,
that you may awaken within your own mind.
Idly contemplate the skull’s form—
why all this striving?
Through craving for qi, wealth, wine, and sensuality,
spirit is harmed,
and one falls into evil destinies.
Yet fear not—
no need for capture or restraint,
for it will settle naturally.
Awareness illumines, the heart opens wide,
seeing floating fame and fleeting gain
as rootless and insubstantial.
Inside and out, upside-down and inverted—
this is the Daoist path of life.
When touched, remain unshaken, unmoved,
for this very nature,
this single point, is worthy of regard.
Divine light radiant,
ascending the nine heavens,
riding the clouds to return.

**To Master Liu of Luzhou**

You and I, from the same hometown,
have long shared affinity,
each chasing floating fame and fleeting gain.
Yet all things impermanent—
one by one, cast them aside.
I first parted from Ninghai,
and soon after, you came to Guan.
May we, of like mind,
unite in heart and virtue,
together delving into the mysterious principle.
Beware of clinging to attachments and desires;
instead, calm the heart, still the intent,
preserve the spirit, and nurture qi.
Within the dusty world,
to remain unstained and unattached is supreme.
Diligently perfect merit and conduct,
ever in clarity and stillness—
some sign will appear.
Divine light radiant,
flaming fiercely—
this is your true nature.

**To the Young Master Wang of Wendeng**

Dwelling in a humble abode,
layered seals, layered locks,
without attachment, without leakage, without flaw.
In leisure, seek leisure within leisure—
there lies the fruit of leisurely achievement.
Ever guard purity, ever clarity, ever stillness,
walking alone, sitting alone, lying alone.
Forget cunning,
further forget fame and gain,
forget others, forget self.
Be simple, sincere, and steadfast in heart,
cast aside manifold doubts and delusions,
strike them down one by one.
Attaining, coming, attaining—
what is attained?
True thusness, thus and unmoving,
awakening to numinous clarity—
utterly thus.
This is the true sign,
where true realities converge,
and true immortals come to celebrate.

**To Lord Ren of Liquan County**

Lord Ren, resolute and bold,
also refined and unrestrained,
devotedly seeks the Dao.
Carefully investigate and exhaust—
what is true cultivation?
Recognize that the heart itself is Buddha;
apart from the heart,
there is no other cause.
No other method—
simply clarify the heart, dispel desires,
and seize the monkey of the mind.
Let not even a fine hair cling to the heart,
how much less tolerate idle thoughts of skulls?
When the heart forgets, realms vanish,
and true nature roams freely.
Ever hold compassion in the heart,
arise in true kindness—
merit and conduct perfected.
Divine light radiant,
in the Great Canopy, freely roam and revel.

**To Academician Wu of Liquan**

Gold fills the house,
white jade fills the chambers,
children and grandchildren arrayed in rows.
Though all desires are fulfilled,
impermanence cannot be escaped.
To break free from the cycle of birth and death,
there is nothing but to dwell
by clouded waters and mountain streams.
Ever pure and still,
no need for rituals or prayers—
only burn the incense of the heart.
Follow the example of Feng the Immortal,
who attained the Dao,
and after him, Master Shi, who departed in glory—
both radiant and unbound.
These two immortals were both
from your homeland.
Not distant legends of old,
but recent, personally witnessed blessings.
Simply let go,
and you shall surely tread the cloud-path to Penglai.

**To Old Master Qiao of Chunhua**

Suddenly cast off the world’s net,
leap boldly from the pit of delusion,
beyond things, steadfast and soaring.
Like a lone cloud or wild crane,
come and go freely.
This lazy fellow in pure poverty
thanks his heart and spirit,
unwilling to toil in life.
Unattached,
leaning into solitude,
engaged in cultivation.
Hide brilliance and wisdom,
refuse to vie for precedence,
envy the worthy, or resent the capable.
All things forgotten, in clarity and stillness—
heaven and earth return to tranquility.
The Three Fields naturally bear treasure,
the embryonic immortal appears,
luminous before you.
Divine light radiant,
pointing to Penglai and Yingzhou—
this is your future path.

**To Master Yu of Yuwa**

There is honor, there is disgrace,
profit and harm,
joy and sorrow alternating.
Gain and loss, success and failure—
such is the way of things.
For humans, there is birth and death;
all that has form
must inevitably decay.
Do not cling to existence—
since ancient times, those who clung to being,
who among them remains?
Rightly recognize non-action, non-doing,
the Dao without emotion,
without thought, without hatred, without love.
Without self, without others, without defilement,
without attachment, without hindrance.
Without heart, one dissolves karmic obstacles—
this very non-being
others may come to understand.
In the realm of nothingness,
attain birthlessness and deathlessness,
transcending the Three Realms.

**To Master Miao of Weizhou**

Boast not of beauty,
boast not of youth,
boast not of cleverness or foolish charm.
Boast not of cunning schemes,
nor of a heart full of guile.
Boast not of many talents and skills,
nor of fondness for family and home.
Boast not in the streets,
nor of wealth and nobility,
nor of surpassing the worthy.
Idly contemplate the cycles of birth and death,
leisurely peruse
the alchemical classics, the writings of Zhuangzi and Laozi.
In leisure, seek leisure—
there lies the profound and mysterious.
In stillness, clarify the heart and nurture qi,
using leisurely effort
to refine the true treasure.
Attain the joy of leisure—
to be a carefree immortal is best.

**To the Three Immortals Qiao, Li, and Guo**

The practitioner of cultivation
need not dwell in mountains,
nor toil in cramped quarters.
Why rush to and fro,
seeking distant encounters?
Cease forced meditation,
and why endure the hardship of tilling the land?
Abandon labor,
no need to peddle elixirs
for mere clothing and food.

Observe where your heart lingers—
with no attachment whatsoever,
shatter all illusions.
Better to stretch your hand in the marketplace,
begging for scraps.
Leisurely witness fleeting fame and profit,
lamenting life and death,
until the heart turns to ash.
Forget worldly thoughts—
then you shall ascend to the ranks of immortals.

---

**To the Two Masters Zhao and Lei**

Hear my earnest advice:
do not fear hunger or cold,
nor cling to external joys of song and revelry.
Do not feign madness or folly,
nor indulge in flattery and deceit.
Do not kindle the fires of ignorance,
nor let fame and profit entangle you.
Do not rush,
nor waver, nor cling,
nor suffer others’ deceit.

Simply live each day in ordinary peace,
abiding in non-action and purity—
this is the true Chang’an.
The great Dao’s harmonious true qi
resides in a tranquil heart.
To still the nature and preserve life,
let all entanglements dissolve—
then the golden elixir forms of itself.
With radiant spirit,
you shall surely ascend the immortal altar.

---

**To Duke Du and Fellow Daoists**

Diligently tend incense and fire,
devoutly recite scriptures,
solemnly make offerings to others.
In every act of merit,
fear losing this human form.
Though you may gain wealth and nobility,
alas, how weary the trade of bones!
What profit in the end?
I wish each of you would heed my counsel
and seek a nobler cause.

Sweep your sleeves and retreat beyond the world,
claiming freedom and ease,
nesting in contentment.
Gather cloud companions and rosy friends,
intimate with wind and moon.
Turn the primordial point within,
refining the original true self.
With radiant spirit,
become one who attains long life and eternal vision.

---

**To the Two Masters Song and He**

Leaving home to study the Dao,
yet how to contend with the heart’s demons?
Within, love and hate still teem.
The heart’s intent races like a monkey, bolts like a horse,
weaving swiftly as a shuttle.
When dusty passions arise,
even a stubborn heart refuses to fade.
Evil thoughts—
all sins are wrought by the heart,
how to escape King Yama’s judgment?

I urge you to subdue the heart’s intent,
crush its competitive drive,
sharpening it as jade is cut and polished.
When the heart is like dead ashes,
spirit and qi harmonize naturally.
With a true heart free of attachment,
arise in compassion without bias.
Good thoughts—
the Dao is shaped by the heart,
transcending this world of suffering.

---

**To Master Cao the Eighth**

The mysteries are easily understood,
yet the heart’s intent is hard to perfect—
how to secure lasting benefit?
Vigorously seize and restrain,
yet how to tame the leaping monkey and horse?
Throughout the twelve hours,
conflict stirs emotions and thoughts.
Make a vow—
even unto death,
wage war against them.

Though you may be utterly foolish,
how can you withstand
unyielding dedication to refinement?
Through insight, know emptiness—
then inner vision sees nothing.
At the moment of heaven and earth’s birth,
in the alchemical furnace,
sun and moon revolve.
Ever pure and still,
sacred power gives rise to spirit’s manifestation.

---

**On the *Qingjing Jing*, Composed as a Lyric for Judicial Officer Xu**

Sleeping alone, dwelling in solitude,
unmoved by external realms,
ever turning the heart inward.
Awakening to the purity of man and turbidity of woman,
the activity of man and stillness of woman—
yet these are not the men and women of this world,
but the subtle union within nothingness.
Who would believe
that this is truly
your own nature and life?

Grasp this wondrous truth,
then still the heart and dispel desire,
cutting off sight and sound.
In profound obscurity,
dimly, faintly, they resonate.
Within lies essence and substance—
awakening the man,
he naturally conceives.
Ever pure and still,
the immortal embryo emerges in due time.

---

**To Daoist Friend, Judicial Officer Xu**

Bound by the reins of fame,
you left Dengzhou,
arriving at Jishi in autumn.
Your fine post as judicial officer
lasted but a year.
As the melon’s term neared its end,
how could you be without
the sorrow of departure?
Alas, the journey back and forth—
over eight thousand miles,
what was truly sought?

Follow the example of Yuanming,
who resigned his office,
or Hai Chan, who returned his seal,
and roam the clouds with noble resolve.
Continue the resolute path of the Divine Elder,
cultivating beyond the world.
Nurture the primordial substance,
refining the cinnabar mound with natural fire.
When merit and practice are complete,
ride the auspicious clouds to Penglai.

---

**To Master Kang of Lingkou**

Each person studies the Dao,
everyone’s heart impatient,
eager for the mysteries’ certainty.
They scour for elixir ingredients—lead and mercury,
the sun and moon of cavern-heavens.
They seek the interval between wood and metal,
hunting the celestial mechanism’s secrets.
Hear my counsel:
these strange names and forms—
cease your search.

First sever ties to qi, wealth, wine, and lust,
washing away worldly thoughts and vulgar desires.
Forget all things—
then essence and qi will not scatter.
With a clear heart, the Dao becomes naturally bright,
and the myriad spirits
communicate their messages.
If you can do this,
the three islands of Penglai lie near.

---

**To Master Xue of Wugong**

Gathered in the same current,
mutually awakening,
you must search without and sweep within.
Vying in cultivation as if in a contest,
competing for precedence.
Seeing the worthy, think to emulate them—do not envy,
but polish the spirit-pearl
unceasingly.
If awakened,
firmly guide the first to awaken,
then those who follow.

Moreover, heed my earnest advice:
in cultivation,
all lies in non-action and the cessation of learning.
Let no worldly entanglements intervene—
return to original simplicity.
Discerning purity, distinguish true from false—
then the Dao is naturally near.
When effort is complete,
you shall grasp the subtle mysteries,
becoming an immortal.

---

**To Han the Fourth, Judicial Officer**

Judicial Officer Han,
declining inherited rank,
unmoved by the pursuit of official studies.
Fearing the reins of fame would bind him endlessly,
without respite,
he held another lofty view—
singing the *Song of the Broken Pot*,
rejoicing in rebirth.
Often carefree,
visiting village cups for idle drinking,
unrestrained by time or custom.

Unconcerned with his descendants’ livelihood,
he took up a staff of bramble,
wandering far from his nest.

**On the One Who Forgets Home in Love of the Dao**

Ever forgetting to return, he delights only in
mocking the wind and chanting to the moon.
A life much like the mountain recluse’s—
if he but turns his mind to seek,
he shall uncover the secret formulas.
Then awakening, he joins the ranks
of true cultivators in the immortal class.

**To Master Wu Hegang**

Outer deeds and outward conduct,
the causes of merit and fortune—
how can they compare to inner cultivation?
Nurture true lead and true mercury,
flowing up and down in exchange.
Before the mountain, the golden dragon plays;
in the great sea, the jade tiger roams.
Suddenly stirred,
formless and shadowless,
the infant and the maiden entwine.
Ascending the terrace of spirit, they dance—
no need to open the mouth or sing in porcelain tones.
Drunk on the elixir’s measure, he lies in bliss,
within the jeweled tower of the treasure vault.
The embryo immortal takes shape, leaping forth,
drawing the green phoenix to steady the divine boat.
Returning to Peng Isle,
golden lads invite him to Yingzhou.

**Four Poems on the Hu-Han Conversion**

The Three Corpses stir and beguile,
the Six Bandits delude and confuse—
naturally they disturb the soul and spirit.
All day long, they vie for wealth and contend in anger,
clinging to wine and lust.
Intentions arise first for self-benefit,
the heart’s schemes unrestrained, never reined in.
Foolish old man,
your body is finite—
what glory do you chase?

Speak not of a lifespan of a hundred years—
from ancient times to now,
how few reach seventy?
Counting the days, they total
twenty-five thousand two hundred.
How much less when half the night is spent—
and still one must guard against
the unforeseen misstep.
If you awaken,
follow the mountain recluse—
do not remain a common man.

The heart wanders, the will scatters,
songs bewitch, wine deludes—
damaging the three hun and seven po.
Heedless of peril, ever clinging
to wealth and lust,
chasing flowery friends and wine companions,
linking steeds to boast of jade bridles.
At feasts and revels,
amid the throng of pipes and song,
he flaunts his fine airs.
Though he possess Shi Chong’s riches,
though his temples stay crimson and his temples green—
how can he keep them?
He is but a walking corpse, a fool,
a witless old man.
Though worldly glory may be sweet,
how can one fathom
the workings of impermanence?
If you awaken,
pursue cultivation—
be no ordinary guest.

Cast aside worldly ties at once,
doubt no more,
discern the yin soul and the corporeal spirit.
Spit out the corpse-worms, banish them entirely—
qi, wealth, wine, lust.
Put others before yourself,
act with compassion,
be like Maitreya.
Cultivate the Great Dao,
abide in non-action and non-striving,
gradually attaining the wondrous state.
Beyond the world, carefree and at ease,
true joy is found—
summoned in clarity and stillness.
When merit reaches three thousand,
and conduct fulfills eight hundred,
constantly revolve the sun and moon—
these few things
others cannot fathom.
Truly enlightened,
you become a fairy of Penglai.

Seeing through all things,
nothing deludes him—
naturally his soul is at peace, his spirit settled.
Sight and sound become as if deaf and blind,
utterly free of sensory entanglements.
Body and mind, carefree and at ease,
unbound by family ties or love’s fetters.
Non-action, non-striving—
begging for scraps to pass the days,
shameless, without pretense.
Roaming freely, his nature unconstrained,
like a lone cloud or wild crane—
who can restrain him?
He envies not glory or riches,
nor three hundred chariots of rank.
All day he stills the heart and dispels desire,
awakening to the subtle mysteries of the profound.
When merit and conduct are complete,
he becomes a true guest of the Ten Isles and Three Mountains.

**To Lord Zhao**

In a dream, I saw treasures beyond count,
filling my robe to overflowing.
Then Master Yao of the Mystic Middle,
led Lord Zhao and his sons of Zhangtai Street
into my humble abode.
As we spoke,
suddenly a bell tolled—
all grew somber.
Thereupon Lord Zhao knelt and requested poems.
As I took up brush and paper,
I awoke with a start.
Thus I composed half a verse of *Shen Guang Can*,
recounting the dream’s events,
and presented it to the Daoist companions below.

The next day,
Master Su of the Clouds
brought Lord Zhao—whom I had seen in the dream—
to me.
This man, newly awakened to the Dao,
came specially to join the Quanzhen Hall for cultivation.
Reading my verses,
he rejoiced beyond measure
and begged me to complete the poem.

Last night in a dream,
I saw gold covering the earth,
pearls and agates filling my lap.
Coral and amber filled my eyes,
jade trees and jeweled forests.
Suddenly, an untimely bell tolled—
startling all,
each heart turning to ash.
Then Master Tianshui came forward,
bowed deeply,
and asked for my pure verses.
Receiving the flowered paper and ivory brush,
I began to chant—
but who, upon waking, would be my confidant?
Fortunately, the clear wind and bright moon
delight my heart’s zither.
In these few wondrous lines,
who shall have the fate to seek them?
If of like mind,
we shall ascend the lofty peaks of Yun’an together.

**To Precept Master He**

Precept Master He,
you may be called my disciple,
enlightened in Chan, awakened to the Dao, versed in Confucianism.
Diligently you study true awakening,
without error or deviation.
Gentle, kind, reverent, frugal, yielding—
birth, aging, sickness,
death’s suffering—alas!
You must advance in cultivation,
refining wood, metal, water, fire,
earth—attaining perfection without remainder.

Disciples of the Three Teachings, awaken—
forget self and other,
dwell together in thatched huts.
Beyond the world, profound words nourish
the Vairocana.
Ever cherishing boundless giving to save the multitudes,
qi and spirit harmonize,
the elixir coalesces into a luminous pearl.
Return to Tusita,
to the Great Canopy and Peng Isle,
dwelling as one.

**To the Three-in-One Recluse, Zhang Mingdao**

In years past, in the world,
you dreaded the three winters,
layering three Zhang family quilts.
Mocking the teachings of Wind Immortal,
the three topknots of the mountain recluse.
Since ancient times, the three treasures of the Ma family—
now there are three quilts from Feng.
The Three-in-One method—
suddenly you awakened,
snowbound, high upon the three peaks.

From then on, relying on the Three Teachings,
you studied the wondrous dharma of the Three Vehicles,
examining them closely.
Within, revolving the Three Lights to illuminate,
the Kan tiger and Li dragon.
Preserving the Three, guarding the One for three years,
you perceived the three fields—
a single grain of elixir, crimson.
The three-times-three count—
moreover, the heart’s zither, threefold,
attaining union with the immortals.

**Exhorting Sun Xian of Wozhou to Advance in the Dao**

Where are the immortals?
Only in Penglai,
carefree and unconstrained—how wondrous!
Sometimes in the ethereal and distant,
going and coming.

Reveling in the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,
roaming freely through Jasper Terrace and Jasper Park.
Boundless joy—
with cloud companions and rosy friends,
hand in hand, laughing merrily.

Unfolding the jade-forest’s elegant feast,
dismissing the blue-clad maidens
to clap hands and summon phoenixes with plumes.
Jade maidens and golden lads ceaselessly
sing and dance, passing the cup.

Drunkenly reclining beneath the pure wind and bright moon,
letting auspicious mists and propitious vapors come and go.
Diligently cultivate the Dao—
assured that in time you shall join their company.

Instructing fellow practitioners:
Do not indulge in frivolity—
the feasts of the ten directions are hard to digest.
Behold the farmer at noon in the fields,
sweat dripping onto the seedlings.
A single spoonful of rice—how many lashes does it cost?
Deceiving others, do not expect heaven’s forgiveness.

Come to your senses—
a chill runs through you,
as if drenched by icy water.
If you wish to escape the debt of the mouth,
let it be desolate and sparse,
quiet and empty.
Abide always in purity, clarity, and stillness,
transgressing no heavenly decree.

With great compassion and great mercy arise,
assist true merit,
seize the immortal’s banner.
Return to Penglai Isle,
to enjoy the celestial kitchen’s delicacies of jade and nectar.

[Again]
Seeing others’ mistakes stirs my heart—
how can I not grieve?
I think of burning fingers and arms,
incense atop the head.
Even if one throws oneself from a cliff to feed tigers,
sacrificing life in extraordinary ways—
how can one know
that some subtle principle
holds a different auspiciousness?

Within the cauldron of non-action and purity,
the true fire in the heart descends to the kidney hall.
Kidney water transforms into true qi,
qi congeals into crimson frost.
Constantly steaming the four great elements,
it becomes luminous, ringing like jade chimes.
The divine radiance shines—
ready to ride the clouds back to Penglai’s estate.

Exhorting fellow Daoists:
Alas for husbands and wives—
they mistake good causes,
for their marriages were never predestined.
Each has their own children,
with no true kinship.
All due to matchmakers arranging unions,
indulging in lust and desire,
wasting their essence.
Seeking descendants,
they raise flocks of grass-like beings,
unwilling to withdraw.

All day long clinging to sons and daughters—
do they ever consider
how near they are to losing their footing and sinking?
Their bodies feed the maggots,
their bones turn to fine dust.
If one awakens to such bitter suffering,
turning back to preserve one’s heavenly truth—
the divine radiance shines,
toward Penglai and Yingzhou to revel in eternal spring.

Admonishing the people:
All delight in beauty—
wives constantly scheme,
their sweet smiles and words full of deceit.
Daily they adorn themselves,
seeking to please.
Hourly they whisper in ears,
urging strife over wealth and pride.
Self-serving,
they never inquire whether it is righteous or not.

Joyful as they may seem,
these karmic bonds—
do they ever consider
that kindness is but disguised harm?
By day they seek clothing and food,
by night they steal essence and marrow.
Awakening, the heart trembles,
the gall shudders—
fearing the soul-snatching,
life-taking ghosts.
Return to the great Dao,
abide in non-action and cultivate the immortal’s rank.

Breaking delusion:
Achieving fame and fortune,
sons married and daughters wed—
unaware that frost has silvered their temples.
How could they foresee
that the great limit draws near?
Little ghosts watch and sneer,
letting them gasp their last breaths.
Suddenly stricken with illness,
even the physicians Bian Que and Lu Yi
find no remedy.

Yet still they fret over family and plans—
the summons of the soul arrives,
and they reflect too late.
They say their children and wives
have cost them their lives.
Breath ceases, the soul returns to the dark path—
they know in their hearts
they have no merit or deeds.
Yanluo’s wrath—
they are sent to hell’s eternal prison.

Lamenting the skull:
Strolling with staff in hand,
wandering the outskirts—
suddenly by the roadside, a skull.
Eyes filled with mud,
mouth sprouting foul weeds.
How unbearable to speak of it again—
how could one ever again
pursue romantic dalliances?

Recall how in life
I urged them to study the Dao,
but they would not turn back.
Ashamed to beg in the streets—
now they lie exposed as white bones, shameless.
If one awakens to life in the fiery household,
death in the shadowy prison—
resolutely extinguish the heart’s flames,
abandon worldly ties,
and cultivate truth beyond the mundane.
The divine radiance shines—
borne by auspicious clouds,
straight to Yingzhou.

Bestowed upon the Recluse of Cave Clouds, Chen the Maiden:
Pure and untainted,
delving into the mysterious and profound—
gazing at heaven, one may discern the root.
Spreading forth the myriad forms,
sun and moon transmit their light.
Emulating Nüwa’s craft,
gathering the void into five fresh hues.
Refining with fire,
the great work is perfected—
flawless, complete.

Attaining a world of pure serenity,
acting without action,
naturally enduring forever.
In the dim and distant,
the indistinct and fleeting,
a fetal immortal is born.
This is the original face—
further knowing
that no mouth can speak of it.
At that moment,
golden lads come to announce
the ascent to the origin.

Bestowed upon Yang Wu Yi of Lingkou:
Yang the Maiden awakened to the Dao—
fierce and unmatched,
shattering the mirror tower.
Seeing through the foul, rotting skin-bag,
she vowed never to groom again.
Single-minded, with disheveled hair and grimy face,
cloaked in straw, staff in hand, hat on head.
Cutting off worldly wisdom,
curbing the fire of ignorance,
constantly tempering sharpness.

Restraining the masculine—
what is it like?
Like soul-snatchers and life-takers,
demanding ghosts.
Wealth, honor, and glory cast aside,
no longer heeded.
Abiding always in purity, clarity, and stillness,
dwelling in non-action,
in the principle of spontaneity.
When merit and deeds are complete—
on the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,
claim an immortal’s seat.

Bestowed upon Yao Shouqing and Li Shoujing:
Do not treat purity
as something ordinary—
it is the secret immortal’s method.
Day and night, uphold the essentials,
forgetting all things.
Yet how can one deal with familiar scenes from the past,
which constantly disturb the heart?
Always restrain—
like two armies at war,
each wielding swords and spears.

Exterminate the corpse-worms and monkey-horses,
abide in non-action,
in the realm of no-doing and no-affairs.
Always respond, always pure, always still—
always attain auspiciousness.
Relying further on true compassion,
when merit is complete,
ascend to Penglai’s estate.
Riding the clouds,
visit Master Chongchang,
the patriarch Pure Yang.

To the Maiden Li of Little Hu Village

Maiden, maiden, in your cultivation,
hear my earnest counsel:
first, sever all afflictions.
Seize the heart-monkey and mind-horse—
let them not reverse their course.
Be resolute as a man of valor,
no hesitation, no carelessness.
Swiftly act—
with utmost bitter resolve,
lest you face King Yama’s judgment.

Sever ten thousand worldly ties at once,
attain true joy, true bliss,
and gradually penetrate the mysteries.
Guard closely the Way of non-action and purity,
the natural Dao.
Respond to things with true constancy in stillness—
qi and spirit intertwine to form the elixir-treasure.
When merit and deeds are complete,
mount auspicious clouds and return to the Three Isles.

To the Maiden Wang of Chang’an

Marvelous is the wisdom-sword,
shadowless, formless—
pure steel that severs iron and hacks nails.
It cleaves the mountain of affection,
severs the dust of love and desire.
Exterminate the Three Corpses and Six Bandits—
no need to strike,
even gods and ghosts tremble.
Always grasp it firm,
steady the tortoise and snake,
and beneath your feet, all is peace.

This sword, all possess,
yet only those who single-mindedly turn to the Dao
will see its power manifest.
With constant purity, constant stillness,
wash its blade bright.
Naturally, it will penetrate mystery and subtlety—
what worry then that the nature remains dull?
When merit is complete,
you must carry it to Penglai’s realm.

To the Two Maiden Sisters of Jingyang County

Marvelous is the supreme principle:
always pure, always clear—
easy to know, easy to understand, yet hard to practice.
To become an immortal,
you must take this as your foundation.
Cease seeking the mysterious or subtle—
simply still the heart,
dismiss desire, forget emotion.
No defilement,
no hatred, no love,
no contention, no strife.

Once awakened, though touched, remain unmoved—
in the midst of nothingness,
heaven and earth all return to tranquility.
Sun and moon share one palace,
day and night merge in radiance.
Not divine, yet divinity manifests—
riding auspicious clouds,
hasten to Penglai’s realm.
Pay homage to the Jade Emperor,
revealing true merit, the Way of purity perfected.

To the Auspicious Laywoman Wang of Chang’an

The matter of life and death is pressing—
why cling to children and grandchildren?
Joyfully leap beyond the household gate.
Dwell carefree beyond the world,
in a pavilion of idleness and ease.

Ever still the heart, cut off all thoughts—
this is called "seizing the horse, capturing the ape."
When worldly notions cease,
you awaken, clear and bright,
naturally grasping the profound words.

The realm of utmost subtlety and mystery
lies where wind brushes your side, moon keeps you company,
rain trails like threads, clouds root in earth.
Only in stillness do you know the cave’s depths—
another heaven and earth entirely.
Life and destiny are not ruled by heaven and earth;
with numinous clarity,
return to the origin, restore the root.
Return to Penglai’s isles,
where there is no birth, no death, only eternal presence.

To Laywoman Wei of Lingkou, Afflicted by Wind

Though born a woman,
your resolve rivals a man’s—
awakened, you leap beyond the household gate.
Why cling to the Way’s pursuit,
adoring beautiful women and darling sons?
Your nature is like a lone cloud or wild crane,
untouched by worldly dust.
Truly carefree,
you may well be called
a great man.

Recognize the original purity of the true source—
what need to discourse on tigers and dragons,
the maiden and the infant?
No need to arrange Li and Kan,
the alchemical pair.
Through non-action, great merit is accomplished,
giving birth to a formless being.
When yang is perfected,
you become a child of the Most High.

To the Assembly of Laywomen

Shunning wind and fearing sun,
cherishing your appearance,
you belong in painted halls.
Before the mirror, you adorn yourself,
arrayed in golden-threaded silks.
But hearing of the Wind Immortal’s molting,
you admire true cultivation,
resolute and unwavering.
Forsaking splendor,
you become disheveled, unwashed,
clad in plain cloth, taking refuge.

The spiritual root once fell ill—
now you know you must act swiftly to heal it.
Circulate within the body
the sun and moon,
directly reaching heaven’s edge.
Naturally, wood and metal become treasure,
revealing the divine pearl,
shimmering in clear waters.
Only then do you realize
these matters are beyond conception.

A Warning Against Retreating from the Way

Why do people study the Dao yet retreat?
It is always because the heart lacks patience.
Those of wealth and status may encounter
hardship and obstruction in cultivation.
The poor, receiving others’ offerings,
grow arrogant and self-satisfied,
surely courting ruin.
Or if they covet bribes,
they invite their own misfortune,
uncommon calamities.

Some refine the heart incompletely,
arising attachments and cravings,
inevitably breaking precepts.
If you awaken to time’s swift passage,
the great matter of life and death,
always maintain caution as if at the beginning,
abiding in non-action,
in purity and stillness without peer.
When merit and practice are complete,
you and the nine ancestors of the seven lineages
together transcend the three realms.

Lament for the World

Walking corpses, moving bones,
chasing profit, contending for fame,
wearing out the spirit, harming qi, exhausting the body.
All day long, they deceive heaven and obscure earth,
heedless of the divine.
All because of sons and daughters,
entangled in worldly toil,
endlessly clinging to life.
For what purpose?
Waiting until the limit of impermanence arrives,
they are sent into the deep pit.
Gold, jade, pearls, and treasures are abandoned—
only the good and evil of a lifetime remain as evidence.
Where is the clear reckoning?
It extends even to the netherworld.
The merciless mirror of karma reflects,
revealing past transgressions as no light matter.
They weep aloud,
regretting they did not cultivate the Way sooner.

The Master’s Painting of a Skull as Admonition

The Wind Immortal transformed me,
endowing boundless verses,
yet my heart still wavered.
Seeing the painted skull, I awakened,
resolving to sever attachments for good.
I wished to study the Dao next year,
fearing this year’s impermanence might strike.
I wished to wait for another day,
fearing tonight’s death,
losing all auspicious opportunity.

What care for unfinished ties to sons and grandsons?
Cutting family bonds,
I roam the streets uninhibited.
Following my whims, I wander rivers and waters,
experiencing another kind of scenery.
Passing through endless sublime vistas,
how much more when reaching the golden land?
With single-minded devotion,
I refine the Elixir of Yang,
resolutely following Chongyang.

Receiving the Master’s Instruction

Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma—
four small fish,
drawn from the deep abyss by the Master’s hook.
Only upon reaching shore were we polished,
seeking fire and smoke.
Eating firewood was as painful as flaying,
refining the stubborn heart
like oil in a searing pan.
Startled and trembling,
we constantly held our breath,
as if unable to speak.

Enduring myriad trials and tribulations,
relying on our Master’s guidance,
each of us steadfast in will and heart.
Where suffering was once joy,
we now vie to advance.
Only fearing the ape’s folly and the horse’s inferiority,
seeing all people as parents.
Ever enduring humiliation,
abiding in non-action and purity,
we diligently cultivate immortality.

Composed Upon a Dream

At the time of the spring festival,
idly sleeping in my hut,
my dream-soul flew to the mountain’s peak.
Suddenly, I saw mountain spirits,
countless in number.
Each wore no trace of joy—
casually, I asked why they appeared so grim.
Hearing my words,
they all wailed loudly,
revealing their causes:

"When we first studied the Dao,
we indulged in wine and craved meat’s stench.
Punished to become local deities,
we lost our immortality.
Only now do we awaken,
seeing wine and meat as enemies.
We must avoid them—
we urge you, Master, to advance in the Dao,
to uphold precepts with precision."

Watching a Game of Go

Contending for fame and profit
is like playing Go—
amidst talk and laughter, strategy is concealed.
The mouth feigns sweetness like honey,
yet hides arsenic within.
Seeing an opponent’s slight advantage,
they press forward mercilessly.
Boasting of skill,
aroused by greed, heedless of self,
they endanger themselves first.

Deeply akin to Sun and Pang’s battle of wits,
forgetting benevolence and righteousness,
relying solely on cunning and deceit.
All day, they wage war,
never resting.
Constantly harboring murderous intent,
seeking advantage in every move.
One wrong step,
and it is as if the limit of impermanence arrives—
even Bian Que could not cure it.

Eleven Self-Reflections

In former years, in the world,
I constantly schemed,
carving life, digging death—for whom?
Delighting in enemies,
drawn into endless folly.
Like a moth flying into fire,
body charred and ruined,
yet still deluded.
I nearly lost my head
to sons, grandsons, wives, and concubines.

Encountering the Wind Immortal’s awakening,
I turned my light inward—
enemies and loved ones could not follow.
All are wolves, tigers, leopards,
scorpions, and foxes.
Rather than nurturing these venomous creatures,
how much better to cultivate beyond the world.

When merit and practice are complete,
I shall ride the clouds to attend my original master.

In former years, fame and profit
shattered my stubborn heart,
while qi, wealth, wine, and lust sank deep.
Within the square inch of my breast,
thorns grew thick as a forest.
Meeting the Wind Immortal, I awakened—
realizing how profound my past sins had been.
I corrected myself, corrected, corrected again,
corrected without cease.

Roaming the heart of heaven and lungs of earth,
I befriended cloud companions and rosy friends,
moonlit neighbors and windy kin.
Free and carefree, joy unbounded,
all seeking ceased.
Even if a poor man should turn from the Dao
to gain glory, wealth, and noble admiration,
I would not—
I would not, would not, would not.

In days past, Shan Tong
bore a thousand-catty burden in the fire-house,
endlessly contending for fame and profit,
jealous, resentful, greedy, grasping.
Ten thousand sorrows and cares
never once left his heart at peace.
For what reason?
To feed the mouths of enemies and kin—
twenty-three in all.

Just as he suffered in the sea of delusion,
the Wind Immortal came,
devoted to saving the foolish and stubborn.
After two years, he finally awakened,
leaping beyond his homeland.
Now carefree and unobstructed,
he refines the seven treasures of inner elixir.
When merit and practice are complete,
he will seek Penglai and Yingzhou to see his master’s face again.

In days past, Shan Tong
rushed about for fame and profit,
his body like a musk deer pierced by arrows,
his heart scorched by boiling water and searing fire,
never a moment of cool relief.
Ten thousand sorrows and cares
tore his liver and bowels for sons and grandsons.
Unaware of suffering,
he was like a fish swimming in a cauldron,
still darting about.

Meeting the mind’s awakening,
he saw that all his past deeds
were but blades and spears.
His heart trembled, his gall quaked,
and he fled far from home.
Now he prays even in dreams—
dares he entertain a single thought?
When asked,
his whole body sweats,
lost in panic and dismay.

In days past, Shan Tong
was too deeply mired in the dust,
willing to die for sons and grandsons.
Just as he endured hardship,
the Wind Immortal came to save him,
pulling him from the sea of delusion
to the immortal shore of long life.
Only then did he see
how wrong his past affairs had been—
nurturing family, fostering enmity and bitterness.

Some ask about worldly customs:
first wailing in grief,
then indulging in song and dance.
Their joy in the Dao, their laughter and smiles,
seem foolish and dull.
Outsiders cannot understand—
only I know the essence within.
Divine light shines,
abiding in wuwei’s mystery,
bestowed by the master.

Wave after wave, kalpa after kalpa,
diligently patching and building nests,
fearing only that sons and grandsons would fail,
what more could he desire?
He sought light food and ease,
idle leisure with music and song.
Yet when urged to turn his heart to the Dao,
he only looked after himself.

Driven to emaciation,
hair turning white as years rolled downhill,
still stubborn and unenlightened,
his sins multiplied.
Had the Wind Immortal not saved him,
he would surely have met King Yama.
He nearly fell into the ten-thousand-fathom abyss—
how perilous!

Living in the floating world,
this floating life,
craving floating profit and floating fame—
like floating clouds, gathering and scattering,
without constancy or certainty.
Floating splendor is neither firm nor solid,
like floating bubbles, lightning, fireflies, or lamps.
Floating illusions—
why do people not awaken,
but take them for glory?

Children are golden fetters and jade shackles,
the hall a prison,
the fire-house a delusive pit.
Wives and concubines are knives and swords,
drawing near, they wound the body.
The suffering of impermanence is the greatest suffering—
pondering it, heart trembles, gall quakes.
Frightened,
I turned back to cultivate the Dao.

The boundless fire-house,
like a prison, like a jail,
confined by qi, wealth, wine, and lust.
Ten thousand sufferings, a thousand hardships,
wave upon wave.
Awakening to turn the light inward,
I sighed at past enmity and bitterness—
unspeakable.
I could only wail aloud,
wail and wail again.

Today, I see clearly:
wife and sons are creditors of karmic debt,
hounding me.
What affection remains?
I cannot follow them.
Free from attachment and desire,
my heart is clear,
easily harmonizing metal and wood.

The divine radiance shines—
this is the blessed fortune of the Great Luo immortals.
The master is like Zichan,
I am like the joyous fish,
my descendants like the stableman.
Those who release show mercy,
those who boil show none—
how utterly unkind!
Gratitude and enmity must be discerned,
abandoning resentment and attachment,
I follow the true master.
Cultivating the great Dao,
I escape the cycle of birth and death,
leaping beyond the sea of delusion.

Then rend the mortal heart asunder,
abide in constant purity,
naturally forging good causes.
The Kan tiger and Li dragon frolic,
a priceless treasure.
Auspicious clouds layer upon layer enfold,
revealing the embryonic immortal,
a golden body sixteen feet tall.
The divine radiance shines,
toward Penglai I wander,
reveling in eternal spring.

Ever straying from Ninghai,
ever roaming the western lands,
ever coming—what purpose?
Ever dwelling within the encircling walls,
ever guarding—through heaven’s eternity, earth’s endurance.
Ever shunning qi, wealth, wine, and lust,
ever in purity,
ever cultivating the nine nines.
Ever single-minded,
ever wholehearted,
ever seeking true companions.
Ever amassing true merit and true conduct,
ever and always,
ever urging others to turn back.
Ever with cloud-kindred I refine,
the precious jade of the true crucible.
Ever approaching the jade pass and golden lock,
ever sharing,
the nectar of immortal wine.
Ever awaiting,
the arrival of the Wind Immortal Master,
ever to deliver me.

Seventy years of life—
a rare span,
yet I am now forty-five.
This single body,
seven-tenths already buried in earth.
Only the fading glow of sunset remains,
until meeting the Wind Immortal,
I at last awakened.
How perilous!
Nearly did I lose my footing,
dragged away by ghostly hands.
I should have suffered in the netherworld’s courts,
but now,
beyond the mundane,
I cultivate and become.
At ease, carefree,
grasping the subtle and wondrous joys.
The withered tree blooms anew,
claiming long life,
firming spirit and destiny.
In time, I shall depart,
to Peng and Ying,
adding another immortal to their ranks.

Seeking friends, finding companions,
donning straw cloak, carrying staff,
unfettered and free,
all because I saw through the dusty clamor.
All day I sing wildly, dance madly,
like Wang Qiao.
Delighting in play with children,
sometimes keeping company with fishermen and woodcutters.
No entanglements,
true joy, true bliss,
true stillness, true emptiness.

Leisurely visiting mountain-dwelling Chan elders,
my heart follows the cloud-crane,
drawn across the stream’s bridge.
Beneath the moon, returning,
I gather two or three close friends.
Before the pine grove, before the hermitage,
we sip wine,
plucking the jade zither,
burning incense in the precious tripod.
No worldly discourse,
only the wish that one day,
we ascend together to the cinnabar clouds.

The divine radiance of Danyang shines in full.
