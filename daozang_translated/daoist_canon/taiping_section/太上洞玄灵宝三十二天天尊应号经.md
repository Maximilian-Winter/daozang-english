**Scroll Twelve of *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Celestial Worthies’ Responsive Titles***

**The Desire Realm**
**The Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity**

At that time, within the assembly, an immortal named Brahma-Luminance rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, and advanced to inquire of the Heavenly Lord of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity:

"In former times, while attending upon the Celestial Worthy, I wandered through the numinous realms and witnessed the Dharma assembly—its wonders beyond conception. Yet the radiance of this day is unprecedented. The ranks of sacred perfected immortals ascend in joyous exultation, unable to contain themselves. The Celestial Worthies of the ten directions don crowns of dawn’s blossoms and robes of cloud-brocade, preaching in a single voice to deliver the gods and humans. To their left stand the supreme perfected immortals; to their right, the vajra-enforcers. Flying frost and purple mist, jade blossoms and sacred herbs, reverse winds and numinous incense—all ascend to veil the sun. At this responsive assembly, the rapture is ineffable. May all beings who partake in this find peace and bliss.

Yet I wonder: for the countless men and women of the lower realms, who through innumerable lives have accumulated habits that form their karma, how may they, through the causes and conditions of life after life, escape the trials of judgment? To what should they turn, that they might resolve their profound transgressions?"

The Heavenly Lord of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity replied: "Your great compassion in pitying all beings for such causes and conditions is of immense merit. I shall explain for you—listen carefully and uphold this teaching.

The karmic retribution of beings is not of a single origin; only by universally entreating the true numina may they attain liberation. Now, I reveal the Celestial Worthies’ responsive titles from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Golden Flower Palace, to be shown to future generations. Guard this secret and do not recklessly divulge it. Devout men and women should diligently pay reverence, beseeching the erasure of their deep transgressions. Burn incense, light lamps, contemplate the spirits, and venerate the masters—all in accordance with the ritual statutes. Strike the celestial bell twelve times, swallow saliva thrice, regulate the voice and harmonize the qi, then chant the *Boundless Cavern Hymn*:

*Luminous clarity nurtures blessings,*
*That path reverses Dragon Mountain.*
*Ah! The jade grove’s branches sway,*
*Resplendent, the four quarters unfurl.*
*Suddenly, the numinous kalpa transforms,*
*As Hāmā spreads the stars.*
*Flowing truth graces the three realms’ courts,*
*Chanting and whistling, destiny’s toil arrives.*

Within the Golden Flower Palace of the Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity, from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Nine Qi Heaven of the Eastern Infinite Realm’s Hundred Celestial Worthies, compassionate responsive titles: through burning incense, fasting, and reverent worship, one may erase the records of the Nine Dark Prisons’ Jade Caskets of the Long Night, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like burdens of sin, and attaining boundless good karma.

The Lord of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth, Heavenly Emperor He Tong, declares: Should all men and women wholeheartedly take refuge and submit, prostrating before the Silver Tablets and Jade Records of the Golden Flower Palace, invoking the compassionate appellations of the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Eastern Boundless World, extolling and praising, chanting the cavernous scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the true, burning incense and lighting lamps, maintaining purity in quiet chambers—they may beseech the eradication of all sins from the beginningless kalpas to this present life, spanning both the living and the dead, the accumulated transgressions of deceitful and false speech. For the Ten Direct Gods of the East, the Heavenly Emperor’s Messengers, the Directors of Destiny and Recorders of Deeds, inscribe these sins in the ledgers, submitting them to the celestial courts, where they bind across lifetimes, unsevered and inescapable. These transgressions are bound in the Jade Casket of the Divine Officials’ Bureau in the Eastern Boundless World of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, and in the lower realms, examined in the Fengdu Hell of raging winds and surging waves, enduring kalpas of suffering without hope of liberation, their sins fully endured, with no prospect of return. For such transgressions, may all be eradicated, the Five Sufferings forever dissolved, body and soul at peace, clothing and sustenance naturally provided, and joyous ease attained. Above, this relies on the great compassion of the Celestial Worthies; below, it rewards the sincerity of men and women’s devotion. In the Golden Flower Palace of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, within the Silver Tablets and Jade Records, the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Southern Three Qi’s Boundless World compassionately respond to their invocations. Through burning incense, maintaining purity, reverent worship, and devout prayer, the Nine Dark Hells’ Jade Caskets of eternal night are erased, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like accumulation of sins, and securing boundless good karma.

Such sins strike the Jade Casket of the Celestial Bureau in the Southern Infinite Realm’s Divine Officials’ Repository, and are examined below in the Fengdu’s scorching embers hell, enduring kalpas of suffering with no hope of liberation, their manifold transgressions fully borne, awaiting no return. For all such sins, may they be wholly eradicated, the Five Sufferings forever dissolved, body and soul at peace, clothing and sustenance naturally provided, carefree and joyful. Above, they rely on the Celestial Worthies’ great compassion; below, they are rewarded for their sincerity in taking refuge.

With wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of Dharma Transformation’s Wondrous Response.

The Heavenly Emperor of No-Thought River Origin addressed the Perfected One, saying: Should there be common men or women who, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the Purple Origin Treasure Repository of the Luminous Perfection Terrace’s Jade Slips and Mystic Scriptures, and invoke the compassionate appellations of the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Western Realm of Boundlessness, extolling and praising them, chanting the Cavern Chapters, contemplating the deities and invoking the Perfected, burning incense and lighting lamps in a pure and quiet chamber—then they may beseech the eradication of sins accumulated from kalpas without beginning, through lifetimes without end, within their family lineage, ancestral halls, ninefold kin and affinal relations, and all karmic entanglements, arising from the transgressions of secretly transmitting scriptures to disciples after having illicitly obtained them. These sins are recorded by the Ten Upright Deities of the West and the Directors of Destiny and Life Registers of the Great One, their offenses reported to the Heavenly Courts, binding them across lifetimes in inextricable knots.

The sins strike the Jade Casket of the Divine Officials’ Repository in the Western Realm of Boundlessness of No-Thought River Origin, descending to be examined by the Lower Origin’s Investigative Bureau of the Great Mystery’s Azure Records. Through kalpas of toil and suffering, there is no means of liberation, cycling endlessly without limit, dying and reviving, obscured and then enlightened, enduring manifold retributions and experiencing every strange form.

May such sins be wholly absolved, the Nine Dark Prisons dismissed from judgment, the Three Wretched Realms emptied, the eternal night illumined, and all beings roam freely in bliss—above, bearing the great mercy of the Heavenly Worthy; below, rewarded for the sincerity of men and women who submit their lives in devotion.

Upon the Purple Origin Treasure Repository of the Jade Tablets of Mysterious Script within the Terrace of Luminous Perfection of the No-Thought River Origin Heaven, the One Hundred Heavenly Worthies of the Five Qi Heaven in the Northern Realm of the Boundless World respond to compassionate invocations. Through the burning of incense, fasting, and reverent worship, they erase the records of the Nine Dark Prisons from the Jade Caskets of Eternal Night, universally liberating beings of heaven and earth from suffering, dissolving the sins of Ganges’ sands, and securing the blessings of dust-mote multitudes.
