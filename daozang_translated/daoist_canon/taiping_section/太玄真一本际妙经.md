**The Supreme Mystery of the True One’s Primordial Wondrous Scripture**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Mystery of the True One’s Primordial Wondrous Scripture* (abbreviated as *The Primordial Scripture*).
As recorded in Xuangui’s *Rectifying Heresies*: The Sui-dynasty Daoist Liu Jinxǐ composed the *Primordial Scripture* in five scrolls, later expanded to ten scrolls by the Tang-dynasty Li Zhongqing. The present text preserves the second scroll, "The Chapter of Entrustment."

**The Supreme Mystery of the True One’s Primordial Wondrous Scripture**
**Chapter of Entrustment**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning resided upon the towering terrace of Harmonious Dawn’s Numinous Abode, seated alongside the Most High Lord of the Dao and twelve hundred million lofty perfected and exalted sages upon thrones of white jade and lion-form. Together, they proclaimed the secret essentials and expounded the wondrous gate.

None but those who shared the Celestial Worthy’s karmic practice and had entered the realm of the Dao were present at this assembly.

Then the Celestial Worthy emitted a five-colored, subtly wondrous radiance, suffusing all lands in the ten directions. From within the light arose sounds of every kind, each adapting to the customs of its hearers, so that all who listened understood.

He proclaimed that all dharmas are impermanent, fraught with suffering, defilement, and impurity, devoid of autonomy, shifting and vanishing in an instant like dreams or illusions.

"You should all cultivate thoughts of revulsion and detachment. Even if you attain immortality and live for billions of kalpas, you will ultimately perish. The Three Clarities and the host of sages are momentary and impermanent. Thus, nothing in the world is worthy of attachment.

For your sake, I have provisionally manifested this body to teach and guide you, that you may all attain liberation. Those not yet liberated remain for the sake of future karmic conditions; when their merit is complete and their tasks fulfilled, their vows will be perfected.

Now I shall return my spirit to the quiescent, tranquil, and eternally unchanging realm of non-action. If any among you harbor doubts, ask freely, and I shall expound for you.

These are my final entrusted instructions. Act in a timely manner, lest you later harbor regret."

Then, with divine power, he shook the great earth, causing it to revolve and whirl, startling the hearts of all beings.

On that day, the multitudes of the Three Evil Realms all found respite, and the retributions of humans and gods alike were augmented. Free from suffering, affliction, and obstacles, all—whether near or far—gathered as one, their numbers immeasurable and beyond description.

Then the great assembly, with a single mind, gazed upon the Lord of the Dao, their eyes never wavering. Restraining their grief, they ceased their lamentations and spoke in verse:

*"The Primordial Beginning, supreme teacher of gods and humans,*
*Now relinquishes great compassion and departs from birth and death.*
*Alone you return to the quiescent, wondrous source of the One,*
*No longer abiding in the world’s defilements and impurities.*

*Your true wisdom is a pure, unimpeded body,*
*Yet no analogy or words can express it without doubt.*
*This is not within the ken of our perception—*
*How could we observe and awaken to the profound principle?*

*We have but newly aroused the mind of the Supreme Vehicle,*
*Like newborn calves, unsteady and weak.*
*We only pray that your manifested body, in great compassion,*
*Will nourish us with the milk of the Dharma, that we may grow strong.*

*O Celestial Worthy, you manifest an incomparable body,*
*The refuge and support of all living beings.*
*How can you suddenly abandon your original vow,*
*Leaving the world orphaned and without shelter?*

*Excellent is the great Lord of the Dao, eye of the world!*
*You fully comprehend the true and the provisional, without end or beginning.*
*We pray you entreat the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*
*To shelter and protect all beings as a father does his children."*

Then the Most High Lord of the Dao, for the sake of all beings, rose from his seat and bowed his head to the Celestial Worthy, saying: "We pray that in your great compassion you will pity all, tarry in your wondrous manifestation, and remain in the world to teach and benefit, that all may attain accomplishment, receive liberation, and universally enter the Dharma-gate."

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, moved by boundless compassion, replied to the Lord of the Dao: "You are able to grieve for all living beings and, in accord with the world, entreat me to remain. Lord of the Dao, you should tell those in this assembly who have not yet entered samādhi that since attaining the Dao, I have passed through immeasurable kalpas, ever abiding in the world and never departing. If beings are ripe for liberation, they will constantly see my body; when karmic conditions shift, they will be unable to perceive me.

The beings of this kalpa, responsive to their karmic affinities, shall be liberated through you, Lord of the Dao. Thus, I now ascend to the mysterious and enter the wondrous. Your mortal eyes will not see my true body and will suppose I have vanished entirely. But if you cultivate right contemplation, you will naturally see me as you do now.

If you have not yet clearly discerned the empty nature of phenomena, you may rely on images and records to focus your mind. Cast my true likeness in purple gold, venerate and make offerings to it as if before my true form, and with sincere devotion, the merit will be equal.

Why is this so? Neither the body nor its image is real. If you can clearly understand the body that is not a body, then the painted image and the true form are not two in principle. Thus, reverence for the image depends on the mind; the weight of the karmic reward lies solely with you.

Those in poverty may use clay, wood, bronze, or pigments, offering according to their means—halls, canopies, banners, flowers, lamps, and candles—honoring me as if in my presence. Through this cause and condition, you will ultimately return to the true Dao and surely meet me in the Great Mystery."

Again, he addressed the Lord of the Dao: "If any in the great assembly have unresolved doubts, ask freely, and I shall assist in teaching and instruction, that they may swiftly awaken and understand, lest they miss their opportunity."

The Most High Lord of the Dao raised his hand and addressed the assembly: "I have received the Celestial Worthy’s compassionate decree, commanding me to resolve your uncertainties. You should heed this matter."

At that time, the Perfected One Xu Laile, Master of the Great Ultimate Dharma, rose from his seat amidst the great assembly and approached the Most High. Kneeling, he addressed him: "By good fortune, I have been privileged to attend upon your august presence and receive your instruction on the profound depths of the Three Treasures. Though unworthy, I hold the office of Master of the Perfected and Teacher of the Supreme Dharma—a burden so vast it defies description.

Now, in obedience to your command, I venture to question the Celestial Worthy. Truly, my dullness and inarticulacy render me unfit for such an inquiry. Yet, as I bear the duty of Dharma-teacher and am charged with propagating the true Dao, and having received your instruction, I dare not conceal my thoughts. Thus, I presume to seek your counsel.

I pray that in your vast compassion you will instruct me, that I may proceed without hesitation. Humbly, I await your admonition."

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed Laile: "Through the accumulation of merit and virtue, you have attained the manifest signs of a lofty sage and become a great Dharma-teacher, guiding later generations. If you have doubts, ask for instruction—you are precisely the one to do so."

At that time, Laile composed his countenance, straightened his robes, and with measured, graceful steps advanced through the great assembly—serene and fearless as a lion amid the sandalwood grove. Receiving the Dao Lord’s decree, he approached the Celestial Worthy, prostrated himself with limbs outstretched, clasped his hands in reverence, and with tears of sorrow and gratitude, addressed the Celestial Worthy:

"Earlier, within the radiance, I received your command, and now again the Dao Lord has graciously urged and exhorted me. Though I am unworthy and shallow, I venture to seek your counsel. I pray that in your vast compassion, you will surely grant me permission."

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy replied with joy: "Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. Now, listen well.

It is like a king who rules over the world, possessing the Seven Treasures and myriad storehouses. At times, this king travels through the four seas for his own delight, universally benefiting the people. The heir apparent, entrusted with succession, continues the great enterprise, while wise ministers, appointed to assist, uphold proper governance and bring peace and prosperity to the people.

I, too, govern all things as the Great Dharma King. Wishing to traverse the most wondrous and ascendant Mystery Realm, I guide the multitudes of the Three Clarities with right contemplation. I have entrusted the Celestial Lord of the Dao with the secret treasury of true and perfect teachings, to succor the destitute and those lacking in good fortune, and to bestow merit upon those who cultivate diligence. Furthermore, I desire that all perfected sages and great saints together propagate the true Dao, each offering benefit according to the needs of beings.

Just as a king selects ministers of profound wisdom and trustworthiness before entrusting them with authority, so too are you such a person. Through countless kalpas as numerous as motes of dust, you have renounced desire and guarded the true, advancing with vigor and courage. Your wisdom is clear, your virtue cultivated, and thus you are able to set your mind upon inquiring into the great Dharma. Because I am replete with perfect merit and wisdom, I can well dispel the doubts in your heart. I know you are capable of receiving the profound secret treasury and assisting the Dao Lord in propagating the Dao and benefiting beings."

Then, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate addressed the Celestial Worthy: "I venture to ask: In the latter age, as the true Dharma spreads, the words spoken follow worldly texts. Yet demonic and heterodox teachings intermingle with the true scriptures, distorting their meaning. How may one distinguish them? I pray you reveal the essentials, that future generations may proceed without hindrance."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "The Dao is fundamentally wordless, without script or text. Yet for the world’s deluded beings, foolish and blind, who cling to darkness and have no means of awakening, worldly texts are established to gradually enlighten the ignorant. Words are employed to proclaim the true Dao, and writings are composed to expound the scriptures and diagrams. Though their language and characters resemble the common, they are not of the mundane.

If you wish to recognize them, listen with single-minded focus. There are Twelve Seals that authenticate my true Dharma. In any teaching where these Dharma Seals appear, it is a true scripture; without them, it is heterodox doctrine. What are the Twelve?

First: All conditioned phenomena in the world are impermanent. They arise and change, age and perish—swifter than flowing water, lightning, a galloping steed, or a whirlwind. None can compare. Even the gods, whose lifespans are limited, must eventually depart, drifting through the Three Evil Realms according to their karma. The great cycle of death and decay is easily perceived, yet the world fails to comprehend the impermanence of transformation. Those of the Three Clarities, perceiving the marks of arising and ceasing, awaken to the suffering of impermanence. Through wisdom, they clearly understand, for they embody the formless. With wisdom, they know and awaken, forgetting and unattached, not taking it as suffering. Instead, they are at ease, joyful, and content, though their understanding is not yet complete, and they remain subject to the arising and ceasing of thoughts.

Second: All worldly phenomena are without a self. They lack autonomy, are not truly real, and exist interdependently.

Third: All phenomena of the mind in the world are suffering. Why? Because they are subject to oppression, opposition, and the impermanence of change and decay. Suffering has two kinds: coarse and subtle. What is coarse suffering? All that is born must age, sicken, die, and decay. Meeting with enemies, parting from loved ones, and failing to obtain what one seeks—these are coarse suffering. What is subtle suffering? It is the subtle impermanence of thought-moment after thought-moment, each moment decaying. Truly, this is suffering, yet people do not recognize it—this is subtle suffering.

Fourth: All in the world is impure and defiled, both coarsely and subtly. The coarse is visible, the subtle is not. For example, the fleshly body—skin, blood, and vessels—is grossly impure, a corpse-like form that stinks and rots. Afflictions, fetters, and outflows, which the wise discard, are subtle impurities.

Fifth: All things are empty and without substance, for their nature is not truly real, and they arise from contingent causes.

Sixth: The ascendant Mystery Realm of transcendence is the ever-abiding Dao. Its essence is serene and spontaneous, unborn and undying, free from the marks of conditioned existence.

Seventh: All wondrous wisdom is unobstructed and autonomous. The works of spiritual power, able to expound at will—this is called the Great Self.

Eighth: Free from the two kinds of impermanence, not receiving any attachments, with thoughts stilled and extinguished—this is called peace and bliss.

Ninth: The true nature is numinous and penetrating, free from all marks, unstained and undefiled—this is called purity.

Tenth: The true and real Dao is not a false or composite body. It is a vajra body—thus it is called true existence.

Eleventh: All worldly and transcendent phenomena are provisionally established, arising from causes and conditions. Expedient means are employed to transform beings, and names are forcibly assigned.

Twelfth: The true nature of the Dao is unborn and undying, neither existent nor nonexistent—this is called the Middle Way.

These Twelve Dharma Seals define my Dharma gate. Wherever their words appear, they should be revered and followed. Without them, such teachings must not be practiced.

With the eye of the Dao, I observe from afar the stillness of the realm, surveying all beings. Those who can discern and clearly understand the Dharma Seals, practicing accordingly—I manifest in various forms, appearing in the six paths of humans and gods, acting as is fitting, now present, now absent, exhorting, guiding, protecting, and supporting them, ensuring no obstacles remain."

You shall take this Dharma Seal and broadly teach it to gods and humans, that all may know and follow it according to the Dharma.

The Supreme Pole Perfected Person bowed reverently and accepted the command.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign rose from his seat, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "Today I wish to ask something; I pray you grant me leave to speak."

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Excellent, excellent! Ask freely as you wish."

The Sovereign inquired: "I wonder—how should beginners who have not yet entered the meditative state practice to ascend step by step?"

The Heavenly Venerable said: "Excellent question, Sovereign! That you ask this for the sake of all beings who have not yet awakened—all men and women of the world shall receive its benefit.

For learners, the initial practice of ten matters serves as the ladder. Just as one climbs a ladder, starting from the first rung to the second, and so on to the top, so too does ascending the stages proceed. From low to high, one must first cultivate these ten practices, and only then can one deeply enter true insight.

What are the ten?

First: Arouse wholesome desire, for with the heart’s joyful aspiration, one can advance.

Second: Draw near to good companions, for through them, the mind is guided to deeply believe in the true Dao.

Third: Seek an enlightened teacher, for the teacher possesses wondrous Dharma, widely proclaiming and revealing essential techniques.

Fourth: Hear the true teaching and be able to receive, read, and recite it.

Fifth: Be able to leave the household life, constantly practicing gentleness and humility to secure body and life, forever severing conditioned existence and escaping all fetters.

Sixth: Receive the true precepts to guard body, speech, and mind.

Seventh: Retreat to mountains and forests, dwelling in seclusion, forever leaving the clamor of the world to cultivate a tranquil resolve.

Eighth: Contemplate that the Great Dao is the true Dharma King, able to ferry beings across the sea of birth and death, just as a boatman rescues the drowning.

Ninth: Contemplate that the scriptural teachings are wondrous medical prescriptions, showing beings the medicines to cure afflictions.

Tenth: Contemplate that the Dharma teacher is the true parent, skillfully giving birth to our Dharma-body and wisdom-life.

Through these ten practices, practitioners can advance in true understanding, enter the meditative stages, and ascend the ladder to its highest peak.

The Sovereign asked further: "What is the sign of cultivating true insight and reaching the summit?"

The Heavenly Venerable answered: "Beginners who diligently practice the ten practices as expedient means study the semblance of emptiness, understanding that beings have no true substance. Gradually, they awaken to the fact that even minute particles lack true nature, all being empty and false. Entering the gate of one reality, they become steadfast and unretreatable—this is called reaching the summit.

Just as one ascends a high mountain, reaching the peak and abiding there without retreating, knowing they will not fall back, they further cultivate and attain superior clarity. This generates the true Dao, increasing its power and efficacy, resembling non-desire.

Because they are still bound by attachment, it is called 'resembling'; entering the true Dharma gate, it is called 'non-desire.'

The profound true teaching can guide beings into the path of non-desire. As non-desire grows, they thoroughly comprehend true nature, rightly seeing that all dharmas are without birth or extinction. Turning away from birth and death, they shatter all demonic hosts. Their minds become like lapis lazuli, luminous and free from darkness. The utmost of the Middle Way is forever severed—this is called turning the Dharma Wheel.

The essence of the Dharma Wheel is true wisdom, which transports one beyond the Three Realms, surpassing the Jade Clarity Heaven to reach the realm of constant stillness—hence it is called the Dharma Wheel.

All divine perfected ones, having attained this Dharma, wish for you and all beings to ride this true wisdom, arriving at the Dao-ground. With skillful means and wisdom, they expound as they have awakened, thereby enlightening others, turning darkness into light.

Through this wondrous teaching, it is also called the True Dharma Wheel. Just as a cart has wheels to carry passengers wherever they wish, reaching a place of peace, so too does the True Dharma Wheel bear practitioners to the place of liberation.

Moreover, just as a king possesses a great treasure wheel to destroy enemy foes, so does this Dharma destroy the four demonic adversaries and heterodox enemies—hence it is also called the True Dharma Wheel.

This is the sign of cultivating true understanding and true insight to reach the summit."

The Sovereign asked again: "If great beings in this defiled age wish to teach sentient beings, with what Dharma should they first mature them? I pray you instruct us so that both may benefit."

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "It is like a skilled physician who thoroughly knows the art of healing before treating all illnesses. This scripture is the world’s good physician, able to show beings the essential techniques for curing the diseases of afflictions.

Why is this so? Without encountering this scripture, one does not recognize the root source of beings’ evil actions, the inverted symptoms of their illnesses, nor the methods to cure and sever them.

It is like encountering a foolish person gravely ill, who, without meeting a good physician, arbitrarily consumes poisonous medicines. Not only does the illness not heal, but their life is cut short.

Beginners who do not encounter this scripture are likewise in the dark, practicing heterodox paths to save themselves. Not only do they fail to attain liberation, but they fall into the three evil destinies.

Therefore, one should listen to and receive this scripture, recognizing the good physician’s art, and only then can one cure the diseases of delusion and cross over to the realm of immortals.

What is this art?

Practitioners wishing to ferry all beings should first enter samādhi and examine their karmic conditions, desires, and differing root natures.

For those heavily burdened by greed and desire, with no refuge for their bodies, filled with impurity, filth, and all manner of evils, break their attachment to impure thoughts.

For those with much anger, teach the four immeasurables, having them cultivate kindness and compassion, forgetting self and cherishing others, dissolving their hostility so that no resentment or affliction remains.

For those heavily obstructed by ignorance, reveal the Dharma gate and skillfully instruct them to attain wisdom.

For scattered and distracted people, teach them to guard the One, restrain the hun and po souls, focus and soften their minds, and practice the conduct of an infant.

For those attached to views, reveal the mark of emptiness to dissolve their discriminating and calculating minds.

For those with much arrogance, reveal the mark of no-self, showing that there is no autonomous power, nothing to rely upon, and no reason to raise a haughty mind. Soon it will be ground away, inevitably ending in death and decay, tormented by suffering without a moment’s peace."

With the suffering of impermanence, all diseases are universally treated; constantly contemplating the true Dao equally heals all afflictions—this is called the sign of maturing sentient beings. Once matured, they are capable of receiving the profound teaching of the Double Mystery, where both forgetting and equality are embraced, entering the true and actual reality—this is called the method of Mahāyāna transformation.

This scripture thus demonstrates how to properly uphold the Dharma. Therefore, I compare it to a skilled physician: those who obtain this scripture can discern the various partial ailments of sentient beings, as well as their common illnesses, and administer medicine accordingly, with none failing to recover. Such a person is also called the King of Physicians. By virtue of this scripture, they can dispel all afflictions, and thus it is further named the Medicine of Wisdom, for it generates wisdom and severs the illness of afflictions—hence the name *Wisdom Medicine*.

You should know that names and meanings are boundless: sometimes the cause is spoken of as the fruit, and sometimes the fruit as the cause. When the teaching is called the *Wisdom Medicine*, it is the fruit receiving the name of the cause. Why? That which can cure illness is called medicine. This *Wisdom Medicine* arises from the true teaching, and thus the true teaching is named the *Wisdom Medicine*.

This scripture not only cures the illness of delusion but also generates wondrous goodness, enabling practitioners to reach the palace of eternal joy and deathlessness. It is like ambrosia: those who partake of it will never suffer untimely death but will enjoy long life and extended years. This scripture is likewise: those who practice it will surely attain an everlasting, peaceful, and joyful life. If one fails to skillfully apply expedient means in learning, interpreting everything rigidly and clinging to fixed views, afflictions will only increase, and long life will not be secured. It is like someone who, though partaking of ambrosia, fails to regulate its use, damaging its potency and instead suffering poisonous harm. Therefore, one must deeply understand the expedient means within the true Dharma gate, awakening appropriately according to circumstances, and realizing the path of ambrosia—only then is it called obtaining the benefit of the Dharma.

The August Person bowed in reverence, praised it as excellent, and resumed his seat. The Prime Minister, Lord Azure Lad, inwardly reflected: the Ten Kinds of Steps expounded by the Heavenly Worthy are expedient means for beginners entering the Dao—even I have not yet fully understood them, so how could those newly awakened comprehend them? Having thought thus, he rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, composed himself with solemnity, approached the Heavenly Worthy, bowed deeply, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Earlier, I heard of the ten Dharma methods as steps for practice, but I have not yet understood them. I humbly request further instruction: what is meant by a *mind of good desire*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent, Prime Minister! Your question has two aspects: first, you ask because of lingering doubts, and second, you ask on behalf of all those who have not yet understood. You yourself, having long since penetrated the wondrous gate and mastered the true Dharma through countless kalpas, have entered the realm of the Dao, bathed in the flow of the Dharma, and equally contemplated emptiness and existence. You are well-versed in the essentials of both concise and expansive teachings, yet for the sake of sentient beings, you now request instruction with expedient means.

Those who expound the Dharma exhibit two kinds of characteristics: concise and expansive. For those of dull faculties, the teaching is both concise and expansive. Opening just one gate is called *concise*; if many teachings are given, their limited wisdom cannot bear it, so within a single matter, distinctions are made—this is called *expansive*, for it requires earnest guidance to aid understanding. For those of sharp faculties, there are also concise and expansive teachings. Fully opening the Dharma gates is called *expansive*; their wisdom is capable, so no detailed breakdown is needed, and they can fully comprehend even a rough explanation of one aspect—this is called *concise*. For you, August Person, I teach in a balanced manner. Since beginners and those of lesser faculties have not yet fathomed these principles, and you, out of compassion, inquire on behalf of future generations, I shall now expound in detail.

The *good desire* arises from past karmic tendencies and natural inclination, giving rise to reverence and devotion, aspiring to the Three Treasures, seeking liberation from the world, and loathing the mundane. All actions of sentient beings arise from desire: if the desire is for goodness, one moves toward goodness; if the desire is for evil, one commits evil deeds. The root of desire lies in the sharpness or dullness of one’s faculties. Those blessed with good fortune are endowed with pure and harmonious qi, and their sharp faculties give rise to good desires. Those burdened by karmic retribution receive turbid and defiled qi, and their dull faculties give rise to evil desires. As desires accumulate through habit, they become unchanging nature—this is called the distinguishing mark of *good desire*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "What is further meant by *drawing near to good friends*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Friends are also of two kinds: those who corrupt and those who perfect. If someone advises, 'The rewards of human life follow fate and nature; when one’s allotted time is exhausted, life ends—it has nothing to do with karmic practice. Like the tip of a hair, whether scorched by fire or drenched by water, who is responsible? Whether one is ordinary or sagely, foolish or wise, noble or base, rich or poor—who has made it so? One should simply accept one’s lot, fulfill what is received, and be content. Why engage in ascetic practices to seek goodness, distorting one’s nature and harming oneself, laboring in vain? Even visible benefits are absent, so what Dao is there to attain?' Those who speak thus are called *evil companions*; they should not be approached but immediately shunned.

If someone says, 'All karmic retribution arises from causal conditions. The mortal eye cannot perceive the retributions of the three times, so one mistakenly calls it natural. This is not the true meaning—do not believe it. You should arouse a good resolve, seek a teacher, inquire about the Dao, and cultivate the true teaching for the sake of future lives. Turn toward the root of faith and accomplish the supreme Dao.' Those who speak thus are called *good companions*; such people should always be drawn near. Why? Because they can generate and perfect the Dharma-body and life, and bring forth blessings and joy in both present and future lives."

Lord Azure Lad said: "Having heard the benefits of good companions, what is meant by *serving a clear-sighted teacher*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Teachers are of two kinds: ornamental and substantive. The *ornamental* teacher has no true understanding but outwardly displays the appearance of wisdom, adorning themselves to deceive others and make them believe and follow—this is called a *foolish teacher*, unworthy of refuge."

The *substantive* teacher, possessing full inner understanding and flawless conduct, wears tattered robes and worn shoes, humbly concealing their brilliance—outwardly appearing unremarkable, yet truly a great person. If, through a good companion, one recognizes such a teacher, one should go forth, serve diligently, and receive their solemn instruction.

If a teacher speaks of the attainments of the Lesser Vehicle, of conditioned dharmas with arising and ceasing, of existence and non-existence, of cause and effect—such teachings are called those of a *dark teacher*. If a teacher expounds that all dharmas are without cultivation and without attainment, without cessation and without arising, neither existent nor non-existent, neither cause nor effect—yet both existent and non-existent, neither non-cause nor non-effect—skillfully explaining dependent origination and provisionally naming the Middle Way, demonstrating such teachings, this is called a *clear-sighted teacher*.

Lord Azure Lad said: "Such great teachers are exceedingly rare. What is meant by the *appearance of leaving the household*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Leaving the household is of profound significance and vast benefit. There are two kinds of 'households': one is the household of affection and attachment, the other is the household of conditioned existence.

For beginners who encounter a clear-sighted teacher and possess the resolve to endure hardship, serving and attending upon them, receiving their wondrous instruction—if they remain in the household, parents, spouse, and children will entangle them in the bonds of love, like being confined in prison, unable to act freely or follow their aspirations at ease. They would be unable to travel near or far with their teacher to inquire into the profound teachings. Therefore, they should seek their parents’ permission, bid farewell to their spouse and children, abandon their home, journey far into the mountains and forests, rely upon a pure abode, discard worldly attire and adornments, don the yellow-brown robe and dark headcloth, renounce worldly glory, and devote themselves solely to the Dao—this is called initially *leaving the household of affection and attachment*.

Having left the household, they diligently practice fasting and precepts, escape the three evil destinies, establish the root of faith, learn stillness and enter emptiness, relinquish desire for the Three Realms, and ascend into the Nine Heavens—this is called *leaving the household of conditioned existence*. This is what is meant by *leaving the household*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "I have now departed from the household of the three evil destinies and wish to leave the household of conditioned existence. But what constitutes the *true teaching*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If there are scriptures bearing the Twelve Seals and corresponding to the Three Caverns, these are called *orthodox scriptures*. All else is heterodox dharma, not to be received or upheld. One should personally consult a teacher to carefully discern and distinguish them."

Lord Azure Lad said: "What is meant by *precepts*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "There are two kinds of precepts: one with attainment, the other without. The *precepts with attainment* include the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, and Three Hundred Great Precepts—restraining evil and preventing transgressions, yet without attaining expedient means. These precepts enable escape from the three evil destinies and the sufferings of the human realm but do not yet enter the path of the Dao.

If one recognizes that all dharmas are ultimately quiescent and empty, this is called the *true precept*—without holding or transgressing, opening the gate of right contemplation, and serving as the root of the Dao."

Lord Azure Lad said: "What is meant by *dwelling in seclusion in the mountains and forests*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "This, too, is of two kinds. The lesser practitioner, timid and fearful of defilement by worldly dust, enters the cliffs, forests, and thickets to avoid impurity and filth, sitting in stillness and tranquility to cultivate the practice of quiescence. The superior practitioner, abiding in the world, is unafraid of worldly toil and, though dwelling amidst it, remains undefiled—like a pearl or jade, inherently luminous and pure. They dwell upon the mountain of wisdom, relying upon the wilderness of non-appearance—this is called *skillfully understanding the appearance of mountain-dwelling*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "What is meant by the *appearance of mindfulness of the Dao*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Mindfulness of the Dao can restrain and extinguish all evil roots, like a vajra sword that cuts through all, or a fierce fire that burns all. There are two kinds of mindfulness. One is mindfulness of the *birth-body*, adorned with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, perfectly subtle and wondrous, uniquely revered in the human and heavenly realms of the Three Realms—this is my refuge and shelter. The other is mindfulness of the *Dharma-body*, like empty space, perfectly full and pure—this is the true Dao, also called the *Dao-body* or *Dao-nature*. Constantly maintaining right mindfulness without interruption by other thoughts—this is called *mindfulness of the Dao*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "Pray, speak of the essentials. What is meant by the *appearance of mindfulness of scriptures*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "There are three kinds of scriptures: the Great Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle, and the Middle Vehicle. Fixing the mind upon them, constantly generating faith and reverence, contemplating them unwaveringly, and knowing with certainty that this Dharma is the path beyond the world—without other distracting thoughts—this is called *mindfulness of scriptures*. If one knows that all dharmas are originally without words, rightly contemplates true reality, and penetrates their purport—this, too, is called *mindfulness of scriptures*, and is called *skillfully understanding the appearance of mindfulness of scriptures*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "What is meant by *mindfulness of the teacher*?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "The teacher is like a father. Without a teacher, I cannot attain the Dao. Therefore, one should follow them near or far, contemplating them with the mind’s eye, always present before one, without interruption even for a moment, and without other distracting thoughts—this is called *mindfulness of the teacher*. One should also rightly contemplate: all the great sages and perfected beings who have attained the Dao are the *Treasure of Teachers*, all capable of instructing me, and are fields of blessed merit. Fixing mindfulness upon them and taking refuge, with continuous thought and without the arising of deluded thoughts—this is called *mindfulness of the teacher*."

Lord Azure Lad said: "Having received this illumination, all my doubts are forever dispelled. In future lives, whether as a man or woman, I shall have no more uncertainties." Having completed his bows, he returned to his seat.

The Most High Lord of Primordial Beginning raised his hand and addressed the assembly: "You should know that my true body is pure and unimpeded, like empty space—unborn and undying, eternally abiding in the quiescent source of great wisdom. Though profound and obscure, its essence is most certain. For immeasurable kalpas, I have realized this true body, ever tranquil and unshaken, surpassing all comparison, beyond the knowledge of sages and the understanding of ordinary beings. For the sake of sentient beings, I manifest a responsive body, entering the five destinies, adapting to conditions to liberate and guide, employing expedient means to lead all to awakening. Adapting to the faculties and natures of beings, I provisionally display forms and images—thus called the *responsive body*. Yet this responsive body, too, is without birth or death, without going or coming, eternally abiding and unchanging. For the benefit of all, it appears and disappears in different ways, inspiring diligence and preventing regression."

All tasks to be performed have now been accomplished; what remains unfulfilled shall be resolved by the Dao Lord himself. You, all the great assembly, should together uphold and honor this, and refrain from generating discriminating thoughts toward me.

Having spoken thus, suddenly there appeared flying clouds, cinnabar skies, the Eight Radiant Jade Chariot, banners and canopies of treasure filling the void. Heaven rained fragrant blossoms, divine dragons and celestial musicians arrived in an instant, all at once.

The Heavenly Worthy then ascended the jade chariot, rising slowly into the sky. The great assembly strained their eyes but could no longer behold him. At that moment, the assembled immortals choked with sobs, wailing in longing as though they had lost their parents. They gazed upward, bowing in reverence, then turned to prostrate before the Dao Lord, reciting these verses:

The supreme, pure, and wondrous true wisdom-body,
Tranquil and extinguished, formless—none can perceive it.
Yet we see only the responsive body return to its source,
Thus each of us is filled with profound sorrow.

We rely upon the Most High, the Boundless Venerable One,
As children who have lost their mother cling to a compassionate father.
We are submerged in the fires of sorrow—
We only pray for the timely shower of sweet dew,
To sever inverted thoughts and clinging hearts,
To dissolve all views and extinguish perverse paths.

The Most High Dao Lord addressed the four assemblies, saying: You should know that all dharmas are characterized by emptiness and tranquility. The realm of birth and death is by nature no different—do not falsely entertain thoughts of going and coming. From the very first arising of intention, recognize impermanence. Each of you must seek self-deliverance and depart from the suffering of birth and death.

The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings of precepts and exhortations are clear: Exert yourselves diligently in cultivation, seek liberation early, and do not harbor sorrow or waste your virtuous merit.

Having spoken thus, he returned with his attendants to the Jade Capital. The remaining immortals, those who had come from the ten directions, each paid homage to the Dao Lord and departed together.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Mystery and True Unity*.
