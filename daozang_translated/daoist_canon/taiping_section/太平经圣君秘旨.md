**The Holy Lord’s Secret Instructions**
*Transmitted by the Supreme Minister, the Green Youth Lord*

The Holy Lord said: The Three Qi unite as One—one as essence, one as spirit, one as qi. These three share a single position, the root of the qi of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.

Spirit is received from Heaven, essence from Earth, and qi from the Central Harmony. Together, they form a unity. Thus, spirit rides upon qi to move, essence dwells within it, and the three assist one another in governance.

Those who desire longevity must cherish qi, revere spirit, and honor essence. Humanity originally arises from the primordial qi of chaos. Qi generates essence, essence generates spirit, and spirit generates illumination. Rooted in the qi of yin and yang, qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, and spirit into illumination.

Those who desire longevity must guard qi and unite with spirit, ensuring essence does not depart from form. Contemplate these three as one, and over time, refinement will naturally manifest. The body’s form will gradually lighten, essence will grow brighter, radiance will intensify, and the heart will find great peace, joyfully as if delighted. The qi of Great Peace will respond.

Cultivate the inner, and it will reflect outwardly. Within, attain longevity; without, attain governance. Without exerting physical strength, Great Peace is naturally achieved.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: before mastery, close the eyes in darkness, seeing no light within. After prolonged guarding, light will naturally arise. Radiantly perceiving the four directions, one may travel far with the light, beholding the form and countenance of the body. The host of spirits will gather, enabling the form to transform into spirit.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: the light may appear as true blue-green. When blue-green and clear, it is the illumination of Lesser Yang.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: the light may appear as true red, like fire’s glow—this is the light of transcending the world.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: the light may appear as true yellow with blue-green—this is the light of Central Harmony, the finest medicine of the Dao.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: the light may appear as true white, like clear water—this is the illumination of Lesser Yin.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: the light may appear as true black, clear as gazing into water—this is the light of Greater Yin.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: when the four directions are dark, yet the abdomen shines brightly within—this is the illumination of Supreme Harmony, the Dao of perfect compliance.

The method of guarding and illuminating the One: when both outer and inner are dark, with no affiliation or perception—this person is perverse and disordered. Swiftly aid them with methods and medicines.

Seek the seven principles above, and inquire within.

The method of guarding the One: the old become young again, white hair turns black, and fallen teeth regrow. Guarding the One for one month adds a year to one’s lifespan; two months, two years—proceeding thus in succession.

The method of guarding the One: initially, one should dwell in seclusion, with thick walls and sturdy barriers, free from the clamor of noise.

The method of guarding the One: when light permeates the six directions, the body remains unharmed. One may thus complete one’s years, and descendants will endure long.

Guard the One without fail, and all affairs will naturally conclude. Swiftly dispel all worries—what more could one seek?

In guarding the One without end, scholars and disciples who wish to be free of care must not deceive one another. Remain composed and at ease.

Guarding the One is the path to enduring wandering. Be ever vigilant, and misfortunes will depart.

The method of guarding the One: the divine medicine comes of itself.

The method of guarding the One: no harm befalls, for each person possesses something no other requires. Tigers and wolves do not gaze upon you, dragons do not rise, and all poisonous creatures flee your form.

If you wish to be forever free of care, seek the One. The hundred spirits and thousand ghosts cannot contend with you.

Guard it with constant focus, and disasters will not shift.

The method of guarding the One: do not speak of its root; carefully close its gate. Do not dare to leak it; guard its spirit diligently. Outwardly dark, inwardly bright—only then can the One be achieved.

The method of guarding the One: it will journey with the spirits. The myriad spirits will come of their own accord, radiantly as if paired.

Those who wish to guard the One: joy and anger are maladies. Without joy or anger, the One may be perceived.

The method of guarding the One: within, there are five guards; without, six signs. The eleven spirits share a single gateway.

The method of guarding the One: contemplate the originally formless. When fluids converge and unite, the One arises from them. Shedding age to return to youth, one may attain longevity.

If you guard the One, do not let many know. Guard the One without retreat, and there will be nothing unknown. All you seek will be obtained—attain it while seated upright.

If you desire great joy, know the One. Forsake glory and renounce fame—the One is fitting.

If you wish to nurture old age, guard the One early. Rest on a level bed, preserve the One, and you will be sated without eating, aging without decline.

The method of guarding the One begins gradually. Guard it over time, and by a hundred days, the One will arrive.

The method of guarding the One: do not contrive clever intentions—the One will manifest of itself.

Those who wish to guard the One will commune with the spirits. Repose in non-action, seek within the abdomen. Though lying in the west of the mountains, you will know the east.

The method of guarding the One is the root of the myriad spirits. When the root is deep and the spirit tranquil, death has no entry.

The method of guarding the One: the old and young differ in measure. Each follows their nature, and the One will be encountered.

The method of guarding the One: be content in poverty, delight in lowliness, and seek within. The One will appear, and you will know that neither high nor low matters.

The method of guarding the One: moderation in eating is the root. The true spirit favors purity; foulness and filth cloud the qi.

The method of guarding the One: silently contemplate its essentials. Circulate without end, without beginning or trace.

The countenance and eyes radiate luminosity, the spirit becomes penetratingly clear. The method of guarding the One: one hundred days mark the Lesser Stillness, two hundred days the Middle Stillness, three hundred days the Greater Stillness. Within, joy becomes constant, and the Three Corpses fall away.

The method of guarding the One comprises three hundred and sixty-six numerical cycles. Each number holds one essence, each essence holds one spirit. When the work of guarding the One is accomplished, this spirit may be beheld.

The method of guarding the One includes the Five Inner Governances. If the mind wanders outward, the inner governances are lost. If guarding the One is done poorly, inner rebellion meets outer restraint, turning the One into an adversary.

The method of guarding the One is ever attended by the Six Controller Spirits, who together deliberate over human transgressions. The method of guarding the One is the master of all spirits, the root of human goodness, the means to dispel misfortune, and the gateway to attaining blessings.

One who guards the One is the master of the divine vessel. From the One Spirit, accumulation extends to the myriad spirits; when all share the same vessel, the Dao is attained. The method of guarding the One: if within there is great rebellion and disorder, the Five Palaces fall into discord and the Six Treasuries lose their guardianship. The host of spirits, alarmed and agitated, all depart to report at the Hall of Light. This is first revealed in the countenance and complexion, known to Heaven and Earth alike. When the host of spirits departs, the form is doomed to die.

The method of guarding the One: in doing good, the effects may be witnessed. Today, in doing good and maintaining purity, the divine luminosity gradually brightens. At first like the glow of fireflies, in time it resembles lightning’s flash.

The method of guarding the One: outwardly, merit lies in practicing benevolence and bestowing kindness, without seeking repayment; loyalty and filial piety are likewise. The method of guarding the One brings a hundred blessings and a hundred misfortunes. If what is guarded is not single-minded, and external affairs are manifold, the hundred spirits contend in rivalry, victory and defeat intertwined.

The method of guarding the One: within, the spirit is ever concentrated, cherished like an infant. How then would the hundred misfortunes dare to encroach? The method of guarding the One is one with the gods and numina of Heaven and Earth. Emerging from yin and entering yang, there is nothing it does not penetrate.

The method of guarding the One: first know the will of Heaven. It engenders and transforms the myriad things, governs without speech, accomplishes without dominion—thus the Dao gives birth to enduring vision. The method of guarding the One enables knowledge of the ten thousand threads. Yet the ten thousand threads cannot know the One.

One who guards the One may transcend the world, dispel calamities, serve a lord, avoid death, govern a household, commune with the divine, escape poverty, heal illness, attain longevity, and achieve enduring vision. It is the origin of primordial qi, the pivot of the myriad things.

Heaven, failing to guard the One, loses its clarity; Earth, failing to guard the One, loses its tranquility; the sun, failing to guard the One, loses its brightness; the moon, failing to guard the One, loses its essence; the stars, failing to guard the One, lose their courses; mountains, failing to guard the One, cannot avoid collapse; waters, failing to guard the One, give rise to dust; spirits, failing to guard the One, cannot come into being; humans, failing to guard the One, cannot live.

The One is the root; all affairs proceed from it. Know the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete.

Here end the secret instructions of the Sagely Lord of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.
