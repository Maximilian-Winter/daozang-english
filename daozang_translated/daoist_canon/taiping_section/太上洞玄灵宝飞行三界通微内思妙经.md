The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
The Supreme Numinous Treasure enables flight through the Three Realms and the concealed preservation of the Supreme Dao. Those who maintain a prolonged fast and cultivate practice for a hundred days will find all illnesses dispelled, their complexion radiant, white hair restored to black, and fallen teeth regrown. After two hundred days of practice, marrow fills the bones, the intestines transform into sinews, scars and burns vanish, and stiffness, muteness, blindness, and deafness are cured, restoring sight and hearing. After three hundred days, one may pass through barriers without obstruction, command ghosts and spirits, ascend into the void, tread upon floating clouds, and roam freely to reach the Kunlun Mountains. After three years, one attains the Dao and achieves Perfection, wandering the Eight Extremities, riding a chariot drawn by qilin, with white tigers as attendants and azure dragons sweeping the dust. After five years, one summons and roams the Three Realms, ascending to the rank of Immortal King.

The subtlety of these words lies in the Dao being magnified through human effort. How could this be mere idle discourse? Truly, the Emperor upholds and magnifies it, for the Dao endures while humanity perishes. How vast is the treasury of the Supreme Numinous Treasure!

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
The *Numinous Treasure Supreme Perfected Scarlet Yang Elixir of the Sun’s Radiance, Jade Token for Ascending to Heaven*, is secretly preserved in the Golden Tower of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Upper Palace. It is not transmitted to those without the destiny of immortality—only to those whose rank corresponds to Immortal King, Immortal Duke, or Immortal Minister. If you encounter this, it is because your predestined karmic affinity has been recorded in the Upper Clarity, and you must present credentials and swear an oath to receive it.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
Master and disciple must each observe a thirty-day fast, followed by a three-day joint fast. Expel all impurities, seek emptiness and numinosity, and await a response in that very moment. Only then may you inscribe the talisman, wear it, and proceed with the practice.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
Consume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
After twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits. Transformation occurs in an instant—short and long shift, sources are moved, flows are blocked, and the Scarlet Yang is ingested.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
Refine the Eight Stones with water to fix gold, boil sand to ascend, and swallow the Yin of the Elixir.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
Contemplate the spirit of the Dao in your heart, dwell in immortal wanderings, and await the traces of longing to ingest the Responsive Yang.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
The talisman is ethereal and distant—gaze toward the luminous peaks, yearn upward to watch the clouds and think of celestial blessings, desiring to ascend the void and ride the clouds to reach Heaven.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
When the Dao is achieved, you will wear all its emblems and ascend Mount Hua. Only upon reaching the celestial steps may you suddenly ingest it.

Consume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected. After twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits.

White qi from the kidneys encircles the body once, the sun to the left, the moon to the right, ascending to the Upper Prime.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
To cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, one must practice the *Muddy Pellet* visualization. Constantly visualize within the head a purple cloud emerging like a purple canopy, gradually expanding until it fills the horizon. The fluttering purple canopy’s qi directly enters the Supreme Ultimate. Visualize within the Crimson Palace the youthful child, the Jade Maiden of the Supreme Unity—three figures in all—seated beneath the purple canopy, holding a jade platter and golden cup, pouring wine, consuming divine elixir and sacred mushrooms. By constant visualization, one remains ageless, ascending through the Three Realms, passing the Celestial Emperor’s fasting examination.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:
To cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, one must practice the *Three Sovereigns of the Supreme Ultimate*.

Visualize the Cinnabar Field situated behind the navel, six inches in diameter, radiant red like the sun. The primordial yang qi of the Five Lads surges like storm clouds—blue-green on the left, white on the right, with yellow qi at the center. Within it stands a red figure, nine fen in height. White qi covers it, red qi encircles it, and black qi envelops its exterior. Within, perceive this figure, its essence connecting to the Crimson Palace. Cease.

First to the north, then the east, then the south, then the west, then the northwest, then above, then the northeast, then the southeast, then below, then the southwest—each direction receiving one bow. Next, pay homage to the assembly of Great Sages in the four directions, three bows to each, completing the full circuit.

Today, I beseech the Northern Lord of Grand Unity, the Director of Destinies, and the Recorder of Deeds to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the register of long life." Thereupon, while lying down, visualize the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, with the Twelve Great Officers at their center, clad in vermilion robes, the waters of the River flowing through and distributing into the four limbs.

Then recite the incantation: "Jade Maidens of the Six Dings under the Recorder of Deeds, erase my name from the death tally and inscribe it in the jade register of divine immortals. My name is recorded in the Azure Register, and from this day forth, I shall transcend the Three Realms and roam beyond the Nine Heavens." Cease.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of the Numinous Treasure for soaring through the Three Realms, one must first practice the Way of the Rivers. Constantly visualize the surging, billowing clouds forming the rivers: the large intestine as the Yangtze, the small intestine as the Yellow River, the bladder as the Weak Water—the root of human life. The Jade Water is profoundly subtle; the rivers are supremely divine. Cease.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of Primordial Qi. On the days of *guihai*, *jiazi*, and the dark and new moons, at midnight, visualize the Weak Water and the churning clouds rising from between the kidneys. White qi converges and ascends, passing through the Five Palaces, entering the Mud Pill Palace above and the Bubbling Spring below, circulating throughout the body.

Cease at cock’s crow.

Cease after ninety breaths. From the sixteenth to the last day of the month, visualize the primordial qi descending to the ten toes until all grow warm. Cease after nine breaths.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of Mystic Transformation.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must visualize the yellow essence and red qi of the sun descending into the mouth. Swallow it twenty-seven times. Then recite the incantation: "Lord of the Sun, Lady of the Moon, divine, divine! Return to the Crimson Palace, together nurturing the Jade Maidens of the Grand Unity, never departing from their palace." Recite this incantation three times. Then visualize the white qi from the lungs ascending to the mouth and swallow it twenty-one times. Next, recite the incantation: "Hongda attained the Dao; Taibai Ziqī, unite with me in virtue, that I may live long and never die." Recite this three times.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize twelve stalks of lingzhi within the heart, their color a true vermilion jade, connected above to the lungs. This is called the "Thought Arrow." Grasp it with intention, and the Grand Unity’s wrath is drawn forth. The heart’s true roundness is called "Majestic Joy." These are the Celestial Grand Unity and the Dao Grand Unity. Constantly guard and contemplate them with focused attention.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize the red qi of the heart descending to connect with the kidneys. Constantly visualize the white qi between the kidneys ascending into the heart, while the heart’s red qi descends into the kidneys. Between them, white qi ascends unceasingly for ten thousand generations. This is called the "Primordial Qi of Yin and Yang."

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize the Grand Unity’s purple sash and golden seal, bearing the Jade Flower Talisman. The seal is called "Majestic Joy," the Heavenly Emperor’s trustworthy signet. Seven figures, each bearing a sword and holding a talisman, walk before you, halt behind you, sit to your left, and lie to your right. Constantly visualize and maintain this awareness.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly practice the Way of the Central Ultimate. Visualize the yellow figure above the spleen, three *cun* in height, with a yellow figure in each hand. Yellow qi ascends to heaven and descends into the body. Upon seeing this spirit, recite the incantation: "Yellow-robed one, Yellow-robed one, the Perfected One of the Yellow Court is within me. Fetch for me sweet wine, rich meats, divine lingzhi herbs, and all that may be consumed."

Then guide and swallow it, completing the process three to five times.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The Supreme Dao of the Numinous Treasure’s hidden journey and soaring flight through the Three Realms cannot be sought without authenticity, nor learned without the Way. If one cultivates with precision for five years, one may transcend and wander the Three Realms, ascending to the Jade Capital—this is the utmost subtlety of the Three Caverns, the crown of all scriptures. Those who cultivate it should purify their hearts and sever all external entanglements. If one fails to do so, even after years of accumulation, nothing will be gained, and one will merely waste their years in vain observation—how lamentable!

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The transmission of the covenant must adhere to the fivefold invocation of the ancient statutes, the jade instructions, and essential teachings. One must separately present three taels of refined gold and a bolt of life-thread silk, its length matching the recipient’s age. If you can study diligently, you may become a guest of the Supreme Lord, roaming the golden palaces and attaining the ranks of the loftiest immortals. How can one not be exhorted? How can one not be diligent?

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: Should one violate the covenant by reckless transmission, or fail to observe the prescribed years, or transmit without the proper oath, the sin will extend to seven generations—bound to the stones of Lianshan, piled into the River of Eternal Night, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas. One’s own body will also perish; how then can immortality be expected? Be vigilant and prudent.

Here ends *The Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: The Esoteric Contemplation of Soaring Flight Through the Three Realms and Penetrating the Subtle*.
