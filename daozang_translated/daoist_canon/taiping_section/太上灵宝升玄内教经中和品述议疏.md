---

At that time, the Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling bowed with hands clasped before the Most High Lord Lao’s Way, saying: "I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao, the origins of attaining the Dao, the graded ranks and standards, the methods of reverence and respect, the teachings of Central Harmony, the doctrines of longevity, and the rituals of precepts and prohibitions. This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank and has yet to comprehend the Inner Teachings. I beseech you to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the Dao, and let all celestial and human beings, men and women, hear the numinous sounds."

The Dao spoke: "Daoling’s questions regarding these methods are most excellent principles, the truest and foremost, the supreme and essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings. I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.

The *Scripture of Central Harmony* is indeed the wondrous formula for ascending to perfection and the essential method for entering the Dao. Its principles penetrate the profound mystery; its meanings encompass the dual abandonment. Cultivating it within oneself, the path to ascending mystery may be exhausted; cherishing it in one’s heart, the gate of the True Unity is thoroughly opened.

What is meant by *Central Harmony*? *Central* is the name for that which is not external; *Harmony* is the term for following and complying. Gathering the mind within is called *Central*; aligning with the Dao without opposition is called *Harmony*. Thus, this teaching of *Central Harmony* follows the *Chapter on Opening Conditions*. Good and evil conditions cause people to abandon evil and practice good. Fearing they may become attached to good and evil, the teaching of Central Harmony is expounded. It not only instructs them to abandon evil but also urges them to contemplate goodness. Contemplating goodness and abandoning evil is called *Central Harmony*.

Within this single term *Central Harmony*, six distinctions are made:
1. The first urges the cultivation of Central Harmony;
2. The second, beginning with ‘I observe the ten directions,’ urges the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions;
3. The third, beginning with ‘all men and women under heaven,’ urges the establishment of meritorious goodness;
4. The fourth, beginning with ‘the Dao addresses Daoling,’ urges the practice of the method;
5. The fifth, beginning with ‘sensual desires ruin affairs,’ urges the upholding of the Five Precepts;
6. The sixth, beginning with ‘upholding the method and cultivating the Dao,’ clarifies the benefits of reciting the scripture and practicing the teachings.

The preceding text is divided into two parts: first, the Heavenly Master requests the method of entering the Dao; second, the Heavenly Worthy explains the meaning of Central Harmony. Within the request, there are two intentions: the initial request and the explanation of its purpose.

Now, first, the occasion of the Heavenly Master’s request is analyzed, from the Heavenly Master to the meaning of precepts and prohibitions. *At that time* refers to the moment when conditions and karmic connections converge. *Heavenly Master* is the title of the Dharma Master of the Three Heavens; *Zhang* is his surname, and *Daoling* his given name. *Bowed with hands clasped before the Way* signifies that when seeking instruction, one rises; when receiving teachings, one rises. Since he wished to inquire about profound meanings, he bowed with hands clasped before the Way.

*I wish to hear the clear instructions for cultivating the Dao* means he desired to hear the distinct and essential instructions for cultivation. *The origins of attaining the Dao* refers to the original causes and methods of realizing the Dao and becoming a perfected one. *The graded ranks and standards* inquires about the hierarchical stages of practice and the sequence of attaining perfection. *The methods of reverence and respect* refers to the methods of careful reverence. *The teachings of Central Harmony* refers to the teachings of Central Harmony that align with the Dao. *The doctrines of longevity* refers to the teachings of attaining the Dao and longevity. *The rituals of precepts and prohibitions* refers to the regulations and prohibitions of the precepts.

This clarifies the Heavenly Master’s request. Below, the purpose of the request is explained. From *This humble one, Daoling, stands at the lowest rank* to *let all hear the numinous sounds*, the Heavenly Master, in seeking profound teachings, aimed to benefit others. Thus, he first adopted a joyful countenance and humble demeanor, humbly declaring himself a lowly disciple of the lowest rank, unversed in the principles of the Inner Teachings. He beseeched the Most High to bestow compassion, unfold the sweet dew of the wondrous Dharma, so that all celestial and human beings, men and women, might together hear the numinous and virtuous teachings.

From the beginning up to this point, the Heavenly Master requests the essential methods of entering the Dao. From here onward, the Most High expounds the wondrous Dharma of Central Harmony. This section is divided into two parts: first, praising the request and granting permission to speak; second, the proper explanation. The first part is further divided into two: first, praising the request; second, granting permission.

Now, the praise of the request: From *The Dao spoke: Daoling’s questions* to *such doctrines are not found in the scriptures*, the Most High praises the Heavenly Master, saying that the methods of attaining the Dao, the rituals of precepts and prohibitions, and the like, which you have just inquired about, are most excellent principles, the supreme and most true, the foremost and wondrous, the unsurpassed and profound essential teachings—such doctrines are not found in the *Five Fascicles Scripture* of the Outer Teachings.

Having praised the request, below, permission to speak is granted: *I shall now expound upon them; listen carefully and receive them.* *I* is the name of self-mastery. The Most High addresses the Heavenly Master, saying that your previous questions align perfectly with my intentions. I shall now unfold and expound upon them for you; listen carefully, receive them, and practice accordingly.

From the beginning up to this point, the praise of the request and granting of permission are complete. From here onward, the proper explanation is given. This section is divided into three parts: first, the distinctions in the stages of attaining the Dao; second, the essential practices for entering the Dao; third, the Heavenly Master’s understanding and resolution.

Within the first part, there are four distinctions: first, presenting the three grades; second, listing the three names; third, explaining according to the names; fourth, concluding with an exhortation to practice.

The Dao spoke: "In my teachings and commandments, there are clear instructions. The grades of attaining the Dao are invariably three: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity. Those who attain immortality and become perfected ascend to heaven naturally, riding the radiance of daylight to reach the Purple Dawn. Their heads bear fleshly topknots, and their bodies are like vajra. Jade lads scatter flowers, celestial maidens harmonize with mist, phoenixes sing on either side, and dragons chant before and behind. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial beings."

Those who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality, evade the Earth Bureau, and with their hun-souls and spirits purified and rectified, ascend to the Celestial Hall. Some fill vacancies among the immortals, others are born as sage-kings. Through successive transmigrations, they accumulate virtue and power, and when their deeds are complete and blessings established, cloud chariots come to welcome them. The merit of deliverance is not confined to a single lifetime. With unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings.

The method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and averts death. By abstaining from grains and purifying the intestines, ceasing to rely on ordinary sustenance, and consuming herbs and plants, one repels corpse-demons. When their allotted lifespan ends, they avoid subjugation to the Northern Feng, becoming instead the masters of the underworld, overseeing the records of human and ghostly life and death. After three hundred and sixty years, they advance to become immortals. In calculating their merit, if they are reborn through gestation, their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.

Yet all three grades require the cultivation of the body, harmonizing qi and nature, reversing worldly conduct, severing attachments to glory and sensuality, and aligning with the Dao. These precepts comprise five meanings:

First, one must not indulge in licentiousness, harboring wayward thoughts that exhaust the spirit and deplete essence, causing the hun and po souls to scatter, the upright qi to depart, and malevolent forces to draw near.

Second, one must not succumb to wrathful emotions, allowing the heart to surge with fury, the mouth to spew curses and invective, and the voice to shake heaven and earth. The spirits will not protect such a person; the true officials within the body will report to the Three Heavens, inscribing one’s name in the ledger of sins, making immortality unattainable.

Third, one must not harbor malicious thoughts or envy others. Heavenly spirits record such transgressions, and the Earth Bureau submits reports, inscribing one’s name in the Black Register, leading to punishment and even death. This is the gravest offense, bringing harm to descendants.

Fourth, one must not drink wine to the point of confusion, defiling the body and altering one’s true nature, disregarding scriptural precepts, flouting official laws, disrespecting parents and rulers, and failing to recognize kinship, all while being led astray by desire. The hun and po souls wail in sorrow, defilement taints the five spirits, and curses pour forth unrestrained, fostering rebellion and disobedience. Heaven inflicts calamity, and the body suffers misfortune.

Fifth, one must not covet wealth and profit, for wealth is but dung and dust, yet people wield knives in its pursuit. In this degenerate age, human hearts are treacherous and violent, and in seeking advantage, they devise schemes to harm others. Wealth becomes an enemy to the body—what use is it? If one possesses it without hoarding, one should plant it in the field of blessings. An empty hall and a purified chamber are the abodes of immortals.

These five precepts must not be violated even once. They are as perilous as treading on thin ice or walking on empty air; once the sentence is decreed, one remains unaware. The wise, whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting, must ever hold themselves in strict observance. Without transgression, the reward of blessings will be manifest.

Those who disbelieve and slander the scriptural teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, will incur calamity in this very life. What I have spoken is true and not false. At the outset of transmission, one must find the right recipient.

Dao-Ling bowed and assented, vowing to comply.

To propagate the teachings is to proclaim the scriptural doctrines, establish regulations and precepts, and possess clear and essential instructions. As for the grades of attaining the Dao, there are invariably three kinds. Having enumerated these, the text next lists their names: the highest attains immortality, the middle attains the Mud-Pill Palace, and the lowest attains longevity.

Immortals soar freely, transforming in myriad ways. Some ride steeds to visit the Jade Dawn, others mount cloud chariots to roam the Wondrous Profit. They may be like the benevolent transformation of Ren An’s armor or Wang Zijin’s departure from the Zhou emperor.

Those who attain the Mud-Pill Palace transcend mortality and realize non-action, discarding the corpse to cross to the other shore. They resemble Buddhist monks feigning entry into nirvana or immortal lords leaving behind empty coffins.

Those who attain longevity enjoy extended lifespans and robust vitality, like Fang Shu, who lived nine thousand years, or Peng Zu, who reached eight hundred.

Having listed the three names, the text proceeds to explain them in order, from "immortals attaining perfection" to "all being celestial beings."

These celestial immortals, having attained the true Dao, naturally become weightless, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, soaring on radiance and riding clouds to reach the Purple Tenuity’s palace. They consult the Jade Dawn’s great Dao and pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Their heads naturally bear crimson topknots, requiring no combing, and their bodies possess vajra-like substance, impervious to harm. Jade lads attend beside them, scattering flowers like flying snow; celestial maidens burn myriad incenses, their fragrance as dense as ascending clouds. On either side, phoenixes sing and simurghs chant; before and behind, dragons encircle them. Their majesty and adornment are solemn and wondrous, all being celestial immortals.

This concludes the explanation of immortals. Next, the text explains the attainment of the Mud-Pill Palace, from "transcending mortality" to "attaining the rank of Immortal Kings."

Those who transcend the Mud-Pill Palace attain deliverance, evading the underworld’s ghostly officials. With their hun-souls and spirits purified and serene, they ascend to the Celestial Hall’s pure realm, some filling vacancies among the immortals, others born into the families of sage-kings. They must further accumulate virtuous deeds through transmigration, constantly cultivating the scriptural Dao. When the merit of three thousand deeds is complete and the power of ninety thousand virtues is perfected, cloud chariots come to welcome them, and divine dragons bear them aloft. Through successive transmigrations and the accumulation of good deeds, with diligent effort and unwavering resolve, they attain the rank of Immortal Kings, governing all numinous officials.

This concludes the explanation of the Mud-Pill attainment. Next, the text explains longevity.

The method for attaining longevity ensures robust health and delays death, ultimately sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment. The Way of longevity requires vigor and strength, necessitating abstention from grains to purify the intestines, dining on mist and absorbing qi, consuming green pines, ingesting purple cypress, savoring white atractylodes, and consuming Solomon’s seal. One repels the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, eliminating the Four Demons and bandits. When the allotted lifespan ends, one avoids the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu, instead becoming an underworld official, recording the life and death of humans and ghosts. After three hundred and sixty years, one advances to become an immortal. If the tally of merit remains insufficient, one may be reborn through gestation, yet their transmigration remains undying, sharing the same root as the Mud-Pill attainment.

This concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity. The following section serves as the conclusion: all three require utmost effort and alignment with the Dao.

Those who seek to attain the three preceding grades must all uphold precepts and cultivate the body, softening their qi and nature, ensuring their conduct is harmonious. Their actions must oppose worldly customs, severing all attachment to glory, sensual pleasures, and profit—only then may they align and unite with the Dao.

The above concludes the explanation of the three grades’ relative profundity in practice and rank. What follows next expounds the essential methods of harmony.

Within this section, five distinctions are made: first, the enumeration of precepts; second, their naming. The first, second, and third employ analogies to emphasize the precepts; the fourth clarifies the harm to those who transgress; the fifth urges transmission to the worthy.

We begin by enumerating the precepts. These precepts, in their meaning, number five—thus harmonizing them, or in practice, five articles. This enumeration complete, their names are listed below:

1. One must not indulge in licentiousness or unite with depravity. First, one must not give free rein to lustful desires, allowing the mind to dwell on perversity, exhausting spirit and vitality, and damaging the hun and po souls. Once true departure occurs, bodily corruption swiftly encroaches. The hun and po refer to the three hun and seven po. The three hun are: the Radiant Spirit, the Embryonic Light, and the Dark Essence.

This concludes the first precept; the second follows.

2. One must not give rein to anger or wrath. One must not indulge in contention, rage, or clamor, nor utter curses or imprecations that shake heaven or stir the earth with resentment. Such grave transgressions invite no divine protection; the Three Corpses within the body will report them, and the Three Heavens will record the offenses. Once condemned, one can never attain immortality. The Three Corpses are Peng Ju, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao.

This concludes the second precept; the third follows.

3. One must not harbor malicious thoughts or toxic intentions. One must not entertain evil schemes, plot harm, envy the worthy, or resent those superior to oneself. Heavenly spirits will record such deeds, and earthly officials will report them, inscribing the transgressions in the Black Register. Not only will this bring punishment upon oneself, but calamity will also extend to descendants.

This concludes the third precept; the fourth follows.

4. One must not drink wine to the point of madness and recklessness. One must not sink into drunkenness, defiling the five spirits, altering one’s true nature, violating scriptures and precepts, disregarding royal decrees, disrespecting teachers, and confounding proper relations. Even as the hun and po souls wail and the viscera seethe, one may still rail and rage, defying heaven, inviting misfortune and disaster upon oneself.

This concludes the fourth precept; the fifth follows.

5. One must not covet wealth or money. Wealth and money are but dung and dust, hindering practice and burdening the body. In life, they invite robbery and plunder; in death, grave desecration. Since they are unnecessary, one should instead distribute them to sow blessings in the field of merit. An empty hall is called the home of immortals; its gates will naturally be pure and noble.

The above lists the Five Precepts. What follows employs analogies to urge adherence.

These five must not be violated even once; their blessings and retributions are manifest. To break even one is to perish, like treading on empty air or walking on thin ice. If one persists in transgression without repentance, the resulting guilt will be inescapable, known to all. The wise should take heed, ever vigilant in sitting and lying down. If one’s conduct remains unchanging, the principle of karmic reward will naturally become clear.

This concludes the analogies urging adherence; what follows clarifies the harm of violating precepts.

If there are those who doubt or disparage the scriptures, bringing misfortune upon themselves—such fools who scorn and reject the teachings, refusing to follow the Five Precepts, thereby committing the transgressions of the Three Evils—will suffer immediate calamities, as detailed in the first scroll of this scripture.

This concludes the explanation of the harm to transgressors; what follows urges careful selection of recipients for transmission.

What I have spoken today is true and not false. You must choose the right person to transmit this to, and never pass it on lightly.

This concludes the establishment of precepts; the Celestial Master responds below.

Dao-ling bowed his head, assented, and vowed to obey. With the instructions thus given, how could he dare disobey or neglect them? He rose, affirming his acceptance of the sacred words.

The above concludes the exhortation to practice harmonious conduct. What follows is the second major section, urging the cultivation of conduct free from transgressions.

Within this section, two main divisions exist: from the beginning to "the residual qi in food," which enumerates transgressions and urges their abandonment; and from "what Dao-ling and his lady wish" onward, which expounds the methods for avoiding transgressions. The former is further divided into two parts: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the clarification of hypocrisy to reinforce the initial exposition. This is further subdivided into four: first, the absence of goodness among worldly people; second, the presence of evil; third, the manifestation of evil persons; fourth, the enumeration of their evil deeds.

The Dao states: I observe the ten directions and all future ages—among the people, Daoists, men and women, the virtuous who uphold precepts, and those in the world who single-mindedly follow the Dao—there is not even one in ten thousand. Why is this so?

In later ages, customs grow shallow and base. Officials and commoners vie in ostentation, coveting glory and wealth, while benevolence and righteousness wither. Cunning is deemed wisdom; fathers and sons deceive one another; rulers and ministers betray their duties. They exchange favors and bribes to buy office...

They dismiss the loyal and upright, appointing the flattering and wicked; they trust treacherous ministers and form cliques to curry favor. The wealthy and noble chase one another’s company, while the poor and lowly are cast aside. Their robes, carriages, and horses are adorned with extravagant splendor, believing this brings success, and they fill the roads with their procession. Those who hold power and rank treat others as if they were nothing; those with even slight wealth see the rich and poor as walking separate paths. The noble and the base each follow what suits them; delighting in worldly affairs, how could they think of the Dao?

Such people, clinging to these attachments, are all fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, it is not worth desiring. Why is this so? Fools are shallow and superficial; once they attain glory and prominence, they become arrogant and extravagant, indulging in excess, following their whims without restraint, and disregarding propriety. The Dao’s purity and emptiness does not accept such people. With the divine now distant, evil spirits invade them. Some feign virtue while betraying truth, praying to ghosts and making supplications. The heavenly net is vast, and though their punishment has not yet come, it is inevitable.

It is like cooking rice: when the fire below is extinguished, the lingering steam in the pot cannot last long. Though evil people may not yet face retribution, they are like that fading steam. The Dao is profound—what people desire is life, prizing the years of their existence; what they despise is death, deeming it lowly. Is this not so? Heaven and earth are impartial, rewarding the good with life and punishing the wicked with death. This fortune and misfortune arise from the unseen. Calamity is not something the wealthy and noble can avoid through supplication, nor is it something the poor and lowly can escape by mere aversion.

Cultivating goodness brings blessings; doing evil invites disaster. Even if a ruler possesses boundless treasures, when facing death, he would offer a city’s worth of gold to beg for life—could it ever be obtained? The worthy, though poor and lowly, need not forcefully seek wealth and rank, exhausting their spirit and wasting their essence, abandoning what truly sustains them, growing arrogant and disordering their minds, causing them to lose the Dao and shortening their lives. Yet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, desire to be like them, laboring in vain for such aspirations, and even if they attain it, it is not grand. Since what they gain is not grand, it is better to practice non-action.

If one seeks to fulfill their wishes, they should cultivate themselves, aspire to the Great Vehicle, harmonizing all—great and small—with a unified heart. They should receive the supreme great scriptures, prepare a hall for fasting with a seat for the celestial texts, sweep away dust and filth, maintaining purity and solemnity. They should burn incense and light lamps, illuminating their resting place, observe long fasts with earnest reflection, and meditate on the numinous and contemplate the true. The Dao will descend, and their wishes will be fulfilled in due time. Their seven generations of ancestors will receive blessings, and in life and death, they will attain immortality. As long as one practices diligently, the Dao will not fail them.

If one has wishes to fulfill, they should not rely on gold, silk, or bribes; nor on worldly connections or pride; nor on meat and wine offerings; nor on clever words or expedient means. With a sincere heart, they should return to the Dao, and through non-action, all will naturally come to fruition according to their original aspirations. If one wishes to create the conditions for merit, they may offer what they can—whether incense, oil, or alms during fasting—to establish their merit, contributing according to their capacity, without needing to give excessively. This makes clear that retribution cannot be limited or measured.

If one imitates worldly people, turning away from the Dao to pray to evil spirits, they will gain not a single blessing, and misfortune will block their door. However, even if one performs such meritorious deeds and fulfills their wishes, the rewards—though vast as the sky—still do not compare to receiving and upholding this scripture, making offerings and practicing rituals, and meditating on it day and night. The merit of such actions is greater by thousands or tens of thousands of times. Why is this? This scripture is what the perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the supreme Dao aspire to practice, for it is the means by which they achieve the Way.

If there are good men and good women who can awaken their innate Dao-mind and receive and uphold this scripture, no wish will go unfulfilled, and no blessing will fail to come. Yet people differ in their capacities, and minds vary in sharpness and dullness. The wise and discerning, though they drill deeply with diligence, still fear they may not reach the goal; the foolish and ignorant, though they may stray and turn away, still fear they may not distance themselves enough. Given such differences, what more can be said?

Dao-ling, you should transmit this scripture to later students who are fit to attain the true. Even those of middling capacity should be enlightened, so they may enter the gate of the Dharma.

The Heavenly Worthy said: I observe the men and women of the ten directions—whether Daoist priests or nuns, or laypeople—none cultivate goodness. Those who leave the household life harbor jealousy and plot in secret; those who remain in the world are arrogant, lewd, murderous, and thieving. Except for those who transcend the world, there is not a single one who gives their whole heart. This concludes the explanation of the absence of goodness; what follows clarifies the presence of evil deeds.

Within this passage, there are three distinctions: first, the exposition of evil deeds; next, the identification of evil people; and finally, the enumeration of their evil manifestations. Here, we first explain the evil deeds. Why does the Heavenly Worthy speak thus of the degeneracy and falsity of later ages, the shallowness of human sentiment, and the way officials and commoners compete for glory and splendor, abandoning the rites of benevolence and righteousness, knowing only to greedily pursue wealth and rank, turning from the Dao to practice cunning, fathers and sons deceiving one another to their faces, rulers and ministers harboring different intentions, seizing every opportunity to endanger one another?

As a ruler, one’s perception and hearing are not clear, and they trust the words of powerful ministers. They exchange favors and use bribes to buy office; they dismiss and exile the loyal and upright, appointing the wicked and flattering. The noble remain in the wilderness while the base occupy the court. They form factions and groups, the wealthy and noble chasing one another, abandoning the orphaned and widowed, oppressing the poor. Their carriages, horses, and robes are adorned with extravagant splendor, and they fill the roads with their ostentatious procession. Those in power treat others as if they were nothing; the rich and poor are treated as different species. Those who hoard wealth are called noble, while the poor and pure are deemed base. Delighting in worldly affairs, is there even one who thinks of the Dao?

This concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows identifies the evil people. Such reckless and unrestrained individuals are all worldly fools. Though they may briefly enjoy ease, how could they be worthy of desire?

Here concludes the identification of evil people; what follows describes their evil manifestations. The reason for this is that foolish people, being shallow and base, are invaded by malevolent spirits. The purpose of these words is to address the shallowness of fools, who cannot look ahead or behind, relying on their power and excess, acting with arrogance and extravagance, transgressing laws and norms, indulging their desires without restraint, and disregarding rites and regulations. The Great Dao is frugal, pure, and empty—it does not accept such individuals. Since the divine spirits have already distanced themselves, malevolent ghosts readily invade and harm them.

This concludes the general exposition of evil deeds; what follows elaborates on their consequences. This section is divided into three parts: first, doctrinal explanation; second, analogical explanation; and third, the synthesis of analogy. We begin with the doctrinal explanation.

Some align with falsehood and turn from truth, though their punishment has yet to be meted out. Others embrace calamity and deception, forsaking the Dao to revere evil, praying to ghosts and spirits for blessings and protection. Yet the heavenly net is vast and wide—though its mesh is loose, nothing escapes. Though the reckoning of sins may be delayed, the retribution for misdeeds is clear. Here ends the doctrinal explanation; what follows is the analogical explanation.

It is like extinguishing the fire after the rice is cooked—how can it last long? Here ends the analogy; what follows synthesizes it. Though evil people may not yet face punishment, they are like lingering embers.

Thus far, we have enumerated and examined transgressions. What follows presents the method to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into three parts: first, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is impartial and inevitably metes out rewards and punishments; second, explaining that to depart from wrongdoing, one must only cultivate goodness; and third, demonstrating the harm of evil karma and urging its abandonment.

Within the first part, there are five subdivisions: first, explaining that human nature delights in life and abhors death, yet people fail to cultivate goodness and distance themselves from evil; second, clarifying that the Dao of Heaven is just and its rewards and punishments are unerring; third, showing that calamities and blessings arise from karma, not power or influence; fourth, advising the worthy not to covet worldly glory; and fifth, lamenting that fools cannot comprehend this.

We begin by explaining that people delight in life and detest death. The Lady of Daoling once wished that life be valued—yet is it not so? Worldly fools cannot cultivate goodness or distance themselves from evil; they merely wish for peace, longevity, and to avoid premature death or misfortune. Whether noble or base, who does not desire this? Here ends the explanation of delighting in life and detesting death; what follows clarifies that rewards and punishments are certain.

Heaven and Earth are just and impartial. Though retribution emerges from the unseen, the heavenly eye is bright and clear, perceiving even the most minute details. Rewards for goodness and punishments for evil are decisive and unerring, all arising from the unseen, without letting worldly people perceive it. Here ends the explanation of unerring rewards and punishments; what follows demonstrates that the arising of good and evil is inescapable.

Disasters and misfortunes are not what the rich and noble seek or pray for, yet they cannot be averted. Blessings and calamities arrive unexpectedly: the poor desire them but they do not come, while the rich try to repel them but cannot. Here ends the explanation of good and evil arising from karma; what follows elucidates the principle of karmic retribution.

Cultivating goodness brings blessings, while doing evil invites disaster—how can one escape? Cultivating goodness summons blessings, while doing evil inevitably incurs calamity. Neither rank nor position can avert it, nor can gold or jade bribe it away. Here ends the explanation of karmic retribution; what follows advises the worthy not to covet worldly glory.

The poor and lowly need not forcibly seek wealth and nobility. Riches and honor are decreed by Heaven, glory arises from karma—do not exhaust your spirit or waste your thoughts in improper striving. It leads people to lose the Dao, become confused, and shorten their years. Here ends the advice against coveting worldly glory; what follows laments that fools cannot comprehend this.

Yet fools, seeing the wealthy and noble, wish to equal them, unaware that their own fate is ill and their bones inauspicious. Even if they attain such status, it will not be grand or enduring; their downfall is near, and ruin inevitable. Better to still the heart, practice non-action, and remain free of trouble.

Thus far, we have clarified the impartiality of the Dao of Heaven. What follows urges the cultivation of conduct to depart from wrongdoing. This section is divided into five parts: first, urging cultivation; second, urging the abandonment of evil; third, extolling the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; fourth, explaining the differing paths of fools and the wise, and the compassion of sages; and fifth, concluding with an exhortation to transmit these teachings.

We begin by urging cultivation. If you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, all will accord with the intentions of your heart. If you desire long life, enduring vision, and the joy of non-action, first receive and uphold the scriptures. Harmonize your heart and devote your intent, prepare a pure and solemn hall with a proper seat, place the celestial texts reverently, and offer incense and lamps. Practice with single-minded devotion, empty the heart, and contemplate the true. The Dao does not fail those who act—it calculates merit and fulfills wishes. Seven generations of ancestors receive blessings, and the living attain immortality. If you but practice diligently, the scriptures will not be in vain.

If you seek to fulfill your wishes and desires, do not rely on bribes, wealth, clever words, or offerings of food and drink. In these four matters, if you act as desired, simply contemplate the Dao and preserve the true, and blessings will come naturally. Here ends the urging of cultivation; what follows encourages the establishment of merit.

If you wish to create fields of blessings, there is no limit to the merit. If you desire to build merit and establish virtue to seek hidden protection, you may, according to your faith, offer alms, incense, and oil, exerting your utmost sincerity. The blessings from such clarity are boundless. Thus far, we have urged the establishment of merit and cultivation; what follows urges the abandonment of evil.

If you imitate worldly people, turn from the Dao, and pray to evil spirits, disaster will block your door. Do not turn from the Dao, belittle the true, or revere evil. Praying to ghosts a thousand times will bring no blessing—only disaster will block your door. Here ends the urging to abandon evil; what follows encourages the reception of scriptures.

Within the section on upholding scriptures, there are three parts: first, explaining the supremacy of scriptures to encourage devotion; second, elucidating the purpose of receiving scriptures; and third, urging the benefits of upholding scriptures. We begin by considering the reception of scriptures.

Yet the merit and virtue thus cultivated, the benefits thus accrued—let us first urge the reception of scriptures. For the merit of such deeds, the fulfillment of such vows, may multiply a thousandfold, ten thousandfold. Yet when weighing the efficacy of virtuous practice, we find that no act of merit, no offering sown in fields of blessing, can compare to the reception and upholding of this scripture—even a single sentence, a single verse.

Thus far, we have extolled the supremacy of the scriptures to encourage devotion; below, we elucidate their purpose. Why is this so? This scripture is the path by which the perfected beings of the ten directions attain the Dao. It is the parent of all sages, the source from which all virtues arise, the way by which all who attain the Dao and achieve perfection must tread.

Next, we expound the benefits of upholding the scriptures. If there be a virtuous man or woman who awakens the natural intent of the Dao and receives and upholds this scripture, what blessing will not be theirs? What goodness will not follow?

Thus far, we have weighed the merit of virtuous deeds and urged the benefits of upholding the scriptures. Below, we lament the divergence between the wise and the foolish in their choices. Alas! People differ in lifespan, and minds differ in acuity. Some are swift, some slow; some minds are bright, others dim. The wise exert themselves tirelessly, ever fearing they fall short; the foolish turn away and slander, their thoughts as distant as Mount Tai. How can such disparity be resolved?

Here ends the lament of the sage; below, we urge the transmission of the teachings. Lord Dao commanded: "You, Dao-ling, shall transmit this scripture to later disciples, guiding them into the gate of the Dao." When the Most High entrusted the Heavenly Master with the transmission of this scripture to later learners, there were signs of their destined union with the perfected. Whether in broad strokes or fine detail, one must weigh the essentials, that the filth of the heart may be cleansed and all may return to the chamber of the Dao.

Thus far, we have recounted past errors and urged their abandonment. What follows is the third section, which clarifies the harm of evil deeds and urges repentance. Within this section, there are two parts: first, the Heavenly Master’s inquiry, and second, the Dao Lord’s response.

The first part is further divided: first, the assembly of immortals present at the reception of the Dharma, and second, the circumstances of the inquiry. We begin with the immortals gathered at the time of the Dharma’s reception.

At that time, Dao-ling received the Dharma. All the great sages, Brahma-heaven Daoists, perfected beings of wondrous conduct, and envoys of the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions—seven hundred million in all—gathered before the Dao to praise Dao-ling. Amidst the assembly, Dao-ling, adorned in ritual vestments, stood with hands clasped before the Dao and inquired about the causes of calamity and fortune.

Dao-ling said: "I observe that among all who revere the Dao and uphold the Dharma, some encounter disasters, sudden illnesses, or violent deaths; some face official summons, slander, or misfortune; their endeavors fail, their desires go unfulfilled. I do not know whether such afflictions arise from past karmic causes or present transgressions. I humbly beseech your illumination to clarify what remains obscure."

The Venerable Lord replied: "Such misfortunes arise from human wickedness, and they are also the result of past lives. Why is this so? Though people revere the Dao, their devotion is not earnest. Though they know the Dao is supreme and wish to follow it, their conduct and nature remain no different from the vulgar. They do not cast aside deceit and falsehood, yet seek to approach the true and perfected with such impurity—this can never succeed. The true and the deceitful are as incompatible as thieves and watchful guards. Though they profess to follow the great Dao, they also pray to evil spirits, their hearts wavering between two paths, thus aligning themselves with the false. Such people, though nominally followers of the Dao, hope for its protection, yet the Dao does not accept them. Clinging to demonic influences, they claim allegiance to the Dao. When disaster, illness, misfortune, or peril strike, they expect the Dao to shield them, yet the Dao does not save them. Demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts assail them, and the Dao does not intervene. Their bodies meet death, their families face ruin. Yet these foolish and vulgar people fail to awaken, turning instead to resentment, declaring the Dao powerless. Even if they do not speak it aloud, their hearts harbor bitterness and reproach."

How can such people fail to rectify their conduct, transform their hearts, and immerse themselves in the passage of days and months, hoping to avert calamity? Not one in ten thousand shall be spared. Stubborn in their perverse nature, their hearts unchanged, upon the end of their lives, they shall descend into the Three Paths and Five Sufferings—then, what use is regret?

How grievous are these foolish and vulgar ones, who revere the false and belittle the true! Why do they not purify their hearts and renew themselves here and now? The wise hold fast to true faith, cultivating and upholding the scriptures and precepts.

The Great Dao is most revered, lofty and without peer, boundless and all-encompassing, enfolding heaven and earth. It governs the host of spirits, gives life to the myriad things—from the soaring and creeping to all creatures that breathe—all are brought forth by the Dao. The majestic spirit of the Dao gathers all, disperses all, dissolves all, accomplishes all, and subdues all. It grasps the pivot of heaven’s mechanism, commands the myriad spirits, precedes all that is prior, and exhausts all that is boundless.

Humans dwell within it, their years and lives fleeting as the blink of an eye. All things are perfected by the Dao, all things arise from the Dao. It pities and cherishes all beings as a mother grieves for her child. Thus, it sets forth the laws for humanity, bidding them cultivate the Dao and practice its ways. Those who achieve great merit ascend as immortals; those of middling merit attain the Mud-Pill Palace; those of lesser merit extend their years.

Such towering rewards, yet people remain unaware, sinking together in delusion, refusing to cast off their vulgar deceits. For this, I shed tears and speak these verses:

In past lives, they sowed evil seeds,
In this life, they accumulate no pure fragrance.
Clinging to the false while professing the Dao,
They invite misfortune and ill fate.
True qi lends no strength,
While evil brings only disaster.
When the Three Calamities arrive as one,
Their families are ruined, their bodies perish.
Seven generations of ancestors sink into the Three Bureaus,
Their souls and spirits dragged away.
They tread upon the Mountain of Knives,
Their hands wounded by the Forest of Swords.
Above and below, the Five Courts of Suffering,
Blood flows, festering into sores.
For ten thousand kalpas, no pardon is granted,
As they revolve through the Five Paths’ grounds.
Yet if there are those who follow the precepts,
The Heavenly Officials shall descend to welcome them.

When the Heavenly Master received the Daoist teachings, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, Daoist masters, Perfected Ones, and Transcendent Lords of wondrous realms dispatched envoys to offer praise. Some rode clouds or harnessed the sun, steering chariots upon celestial terraces—seven hundred billion in all, gathered beneath the Ascending Mystery Seat. Once this assembly had taken their places, the proceedings turned to the sequence of inquiries below.

Within this discourse, two distinctions are made: first, the effect is raised to trace its cause; next, the cause is examined to clarify its effect. The initial inquiry concerns the cause.

Dao-ling observed that those who devotedly follow the Dao and its precepts often fail to attain their desires. Though the world’s people uphold the Dao and its laws, and should be shielded by sacred power, why do they so frequently encounter misfortune, calamity, and peril—even untimely death? Some succumb to sudden illness, others to unjust imprisonment; their endeavors fail, and nothing prospers. This concludes the inquiry into effects to trace their causes. Next, the cause is examined to clarify the effect.

It remains unclear what offenses these individuals have committed. Are their sufferings the result of present transgressions or karmic retribution from past lives? With this question posed, the Most High Lord Lao begins His response.

Within His answer, prose and verse intermingle. The prose is divided into three main sections: first, the enumeration of evil deeds; second, the exhortation to abandon evil; and third, the encouragement to cultivate the Dao. The first section is further divided into two parts: first, the exposition of evil’s origins, and second, the explanation of evil’s manifestations.

Now addressing the first part, Lord Lao replies: Such afflictions arise from human wickedness, rooted in past lives. These troubled souls fall into two categories: those who bring suffering upon themselves, and those upon whom past-life misfortunes descend.

Having outlined the origins of evil, the text proceeds to explain its manifestations. Why do those who follow the Dao with insufficient diligence fail to perceive its rewards? Initially, they may grow resentful, wavering in their commitment, lacking sincerity. Their devotion flickers, their resolve falters. Though they hear of the Dao’s exalted nature and rejoice in its pursuit, they have not shed worldly ways; their hearts remain tainted by deceit. How can they attain the true Dao while clinging to falsehood? When the false encounters the true, it is like a thief meeting a watchful guard. Because their hearts are not steadfast, Heaven allows evil to take hold. As they cling to corrupt spirits, the true Dao withholds its protection. Even when disaster or illness strikes, no aid is granted; the corrupt spirits prevail, leading to bodily death and the ruin of their households. Yet the foolish, worldly masses remain oblivious, even declaring the Dao powerless and harboring resentment.

This concludes the exposition of evil deeds; what follows is the exhortation to repent. Why do these individuals not rectify their conduct while repentance is still possible? Why do they not refine their precepts and transform their hearts? Day by day, they steep themselves in corruption. Heaven’s net is vast and wide-meshed, yet nothing escapes it; rewards for good and punishments for evil are meted out without exception. Why do you persist in perversity? If you cannot reflect on your transgressions and make amends, your life will end in the dark depths of evil destinies—what use will regret be then?

Having urged repentance, the text next exhorts the abandonment of evil. How pitiable are the foolish masses, who persist in error to this extent! The Great Sage, in boundless compassion, grieves for their plight. How can they bear to revere falsehood and belittle the Dao, refusing to uphold the precepts and cultivate truth? Why not wash away wickedness and renew yourselves with virtuous deeds?

Having enumerated evil and urged its abandonment, the text turns to the Dao to encourage its cultivation. This section is divided into four parts: first, the Dao’s exalted nature demands cultivation; second, the Dao’s power demands cultivation; third, the Dao’s creative capacity demands cultivation; and fourth, the Dao’s benefits demand its pursuit.

First, the Dao’s exalted nature: The worthy must rectify their hearts, uphold the scriptures and precepts, for the Great Dao is most revered—all things arise from it. The wise and discerning should align their hearts, receive the great scriptures, and diligently cultivate the supreme Dao. The Dao’s laws are sublime and beyond comprehension. Heaven and Earth endure by its grace; the myriad beings flourish through its nurture. Vast, it encompasses all without limit; subtle, it enters the infinitesimal. Given the Dao’s lofty and wondrous nature, why do the worthy not cultivate and uphold it?

Next, the Dao’s power: The Dao’s numinous might extends everywhere, even to the boundless. Its divine power summons all, averts all, subdues all. It grasps the celestial mechanisms, commands all spirits. It precedes all precedence, exhausts all limits. This concludes the explanation of the Dao’s power.

Next, the Dao’s creative capacity: Though human lifespans are fleeting, one must cultivate the Dao and practice its ways. Though lives vary in length, all exist within the Dao’s creation. The Great Dao, like a mother grieving for her child, earnestly expounds the scriptures and precepts, urging all to cultivate the Dao and study immortality.

Having explained the Dao’s benefits, the text proceeds to assess merit and conduct. Those whose merit is supreme ascend as immortals. This illustrates how the depth of one’s merit determines the measure of one’s reward—yet people remain unaware, persisting in evil without reform, sinking together into ruin, with no hope of return. The Great Sage, moved by compassion, weeps for them and leaves behind scriptures and precepts, exhorting them to abandon wickedness.

This concludes the prose; what follows are the verses. The verses are divided into three parts: first, a single line on the causes of evil; next, a single line on the effects of evil; and finally, a single line exhorting the cultivation of the Dao.

First, the causes of evil:
In past lives, they sowed evil seeds,
In this life, they accumulate no pure fragrance.
Clinging to the false while professing the Dao,
They invite misfortune and ill fate.

This concludes the verse on evil’s causes; next, the verse on evil’s effects:
True qi lends no strength,
While evil brings only disaster.
When the Three Calamities arrive as one,
Their families are ruined, their bodies perish.
Seven generations of ancestors sink into the Three Bureaus,
Their souls and spirits dragged away.
They tread upon the Mountain of Knives,
Their hands wounded by the Forest of Swords.
Above and below, the Five Courts of Suffering,
Blood flows, festering into sores.
For ten thousand kalpas, no pardon is granted,
As they revolve through the Five Paths’ grounds.

Here follows the translation:

---

This concludes the admonition against evil; next, the exhortation to cultivate the Dao.

Should there be disciples of the precepts and laws,
Heavenly officials descend to welcome them.
If there are disciples of the precepts and laws,
Heavenly officials descend to greet them,
Phoenix chariots drifting in misty clouds,
Dragon carriages towering amidst the void.

From the above to this point concludes the exposition on avoiding transgressions. What follows is the third major section, urging the establishment of meritorious deeds.

Within this section, there are three distinctions:
First, the prose exposition, to urge the establishment of merit;
Next, the verse and hymn, to urge the practice of the Dao;
After the verse, examples of benefits are given to encourage.

Within the prose exposition, there are four distinctions:
First, the exhortation to reform transgressions;
Second, the exhortation to establish merit;
Third, the exhortation to cultivate practice;
Fourth, the clarification of benefits obtained.

Within the section on reforming transgressions, there are two intentions:
First, to urge the abandonment of evil and the preservation of mindfulness;
Next, to urge the upholding of scriptures for repentance.

The first part has two aspects:
First, to urge the abandonment of evil;
Next, to urge mindfulness of the Dao.

First, the correction of past transgressions is explained.

The Dao says: Men and women of the world, turning away from the true and correct, disobeying teachings and precepts, indulge only in lust, desire, wealth, honor, glory, sensual pleasures, riches, wine, and meat. They follow their hearts’ desires, acting with arrogance and excess—how could they ever contemplate the Dao?

When people constantly contemplate the Dao, the Dao also contemplates them.
People are like fish, the Dao like water—
Fish live when they obtain water, and die when they lose it.
If the qi of the Dao does not reside within,
The human body becomes empty;
When the body is empty, how can it endure for long?
The key lies in diligent progress, preserving mindfulness of the utmost truth.

I address all worthy ones: If you wish to preserve your life, transcend the mortal form, attain the Dao, and achieve true perfection, you should revere and receive *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Ascending Mystery and the Inner Teachings of the True One*. You must purify your hearts, eliminate past transgressions, reform and cultivate future goodness, and align with the scriptural laws.

Those who can do this accord with the intent of the Supreme Orthodox and True Dao.

All who follow the Dao must eliminate transgressions, establish merit, reflect on their sins, and make amends for their faults.

If, before encountering the scriptural laws, you have killed with your own hands, you should save and revive one person on the verge of death to atone for it.
Once the transgression is eliminated, you also gain the merit of saving a life.

If you have committed robbery or theft, taking others’ property, after receiving the Dharma, you should vow with heart and mouth, using your private wealth to bestow alms upon the poor and establish meritorious deeds.
Once the debt is resolved, you also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.

If you have slandered those superior to yourself with your words, falsely accused and harmed the worthy and good, or wrongly accused the innocent, you should promote and elevate the worthy to make amends.
Once the burden is settled, you also gain the recompense of advancing the virtuous.

Turning misfortune into fortune—these are the essential words.

Thus, when the practice of the Dao is established, your words and commands must be treasured.
When you see others making mistakes, admonish and exhort one another, propagate the scriptural Dharma, and universally deliver gods and humans.
Let all men and women obtain the benefits of the Dharma.
Such meritorious rewards are immeasurable.

Do not claim the Dao is formless and act with arrogance and disdain. Instead, devote yourself to diligent cultivation, maintaining purity day and night.
If you see people suffering from illness, you should save and deliver them.
Do not deceive the foolish with cunning, exploit power to feign deceit, rely on ghosts and spirits to intimidate the people, or seize others’ property.
Do not boast of minor knowledge, claim greatness, belittle the foolish and lowly, or slander one another.
Do not engage in frivolous discussions, pointing out the faults of the worthy.
Do not harbor private greed and malice, respecting the noble while shaming the humble, favoring the rich while abandoning the poor, or feigning generosity for personal gain.
Do not seek blessings by following personal desires, considering it benevolence.
The Dao will never comply, ghosts will not serve you, and if you destroy the true Dharma, you will suffer the consequences yourself.

Strive to seek those of like mind, befriend those of the same Dharma.

If men and women cannot read or write, simply receive the scriptural Dharma, devote your hearts to the Dao, listen to the recitation of scriptures and precepts, gather in the fasting hall, and attentively receive without forgetting.
You may also burn incense in the hall, sit in purity, maintaining separation between men and women, with solemn and proper demeanor. Calm your spirits, concentrate your minds, and listen clearly to the sounds of the Dharma.
Do not speak frivolously, lean or slouch improperly.
Do not let your minds wander to other thoughts, grow lazy, or fall asleep. Do not face each other, chattering noisily, exhausting your bodies with self-imposed labor, suffering without gain.

If you can be reverent and solemn according to the Dharma, you will receive boundless blessings. The immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect you, ensuring you remain free from disaster and attain the Dao to ascend to heaven.

Then, the Most High Lord Lao spoke in verse:

Revere emptiness and honor the Great Vehicle,
Severing both form and desire.
The essentials arise from diligent progress,
Leaving no place for demonic forces to array.
Transform misfortune by cultivating virtuous conduct,
And past debts naturally vanish.
Merit accumulates and renews daily,
Transcending the mundane with distinction.
Words and commands must be treasured and employed,
Great merit is thereby established.
There are foolish and evil people in the world
Who invoke names and establish ghostly teachings.
They practice private deceit in public conduct,
A thousand words yield not a single effect.
Indulging their hearts in demonic affairs,
They bring upon themselves great trials.
Unknowing of the source of their transgressions,
They suddenly meet with ruin and violence.
Their souls are imprisoned in the courts of Fengdu,
Where pain and poison arrive in full.
Yet there are those who delight in the Dharma,
Entrusting their faith to causes and conditions.
Though they may not understand written words,
Their hearts recognize the intent within.
Empty their minds of perverse thoughts,
Listening to the recitation of thousands of words.
Devoting their hearts, they attain the Dao,
Thus becoming Supreme Perfected Ones.
Simply by upholding and contemplating,
Their merit naturally fills the heavens.

All good men,
Focus your minds and listen to my scripture.
Do not engage in idle discussions,
Or act without sincerity.
First, it disrupts the supreme teachings;
Second, it exhausts the body.
Exhausting the body brings self-suffering,
And the reward for love is not wisdom.
You should be reverent and solemn,
Do not slight the divine spirits.
When you see those who diligently progress,
They ascend as immortals to fill heavenly offices.
Soaring beyond the Brahma realms,
Their learning is not at all difficult.
Why cling to the impurities of the world,
And not aspire to transcend form and spirit?

---

The Golden Gates offer no joy in wandering,
Together we serve at the Northern Portal.
I see the fivefold sufferers’ torment—
Wailing atop the Knife Mountain’s peak,
Their faces bereft of human semblance,
Begging among the hungry ghosts.
Heaven’s punishments are ever applied,
Enduring trials through kalpas unending.
This comes from failing to accumulate goodness,
Slandering and harming the true and worthy.
Retribution arrives in an instant,
Yet fools insist it is not so.
If one does not reform oneself,
They alone fall to heaven’s ruin.

Far better to cultivate the great Dao,
Joining the host of Perfected Ones.
In this world, men and women alike
All turn from the true and upright,
Unable to uphold precepts or scriptures,
Only craving glory, wealth, and honor,
Indulging in wine and meat to please their hearts,
Letting wealth and desire fill their minds.
They know only excess, pride, and extravagance—
Not one among them thinks of the Dao.

This first urges reform of evil,
Next urges the keeping of mindfulness.
There is a dharma with parable,
That people may always think of the Dao,
And the Dao will think of them in return.
If one can think of the Dao,
How could the Dao not think of them?
The analogy is made clear:
People are like fish within water—
When the water is lost, they die.
Thus the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says:
People are within the Dao, the Dao within people;
Fish are within water, water within fish.
When the Dao departs, people die;
When water dries, the fish’s life ends.
This is the meaning.
Below, the analogy is applied
To urge the cultivation of the Dao.
When the Dao’s qi does not abide,
The human body becomes empty.
If one maintains mindfulness of the utmost truth,
The Dao’s qi will not depart,
And the body will not become empty.
If the body is empty,
How can it endure long?
One must diligently cultivate the supreme Dao,
Maintaining mindfulness of the utmost truth.

This urges reform of evil and keeping of mindfulness.
Next, it urges upholding scriptures to eliminate transgressions.
The text is divided into three parts:
First, urging the upholding of scriptures;
Second, urging the elimination of transgressions;
Third, clarifying attainment of the Dao.
First, urging the scriptures:
It tells all worthy ones,
If you wish to preserve life and transcend the self,
You must revere the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.
The Dao tells the worthy:
If you desire life, transcendence, and attainment of the Dao,
You must honor and receive the *True One Scripture of Ascending Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.
Its power will sustain you,
And you will naturally attain the Dao.

This urges the receiving of scriptures.
Next, urging the elimination of transgressions:
All should purify their hearts
To accord with the scripture’s dharma.
They must wash away filth,
Reflect on their faults, and make amends,
Following only the Dao,
Devoting themselves only to the dharma.

This urges the elimination of transgressions.
Below, it clarifies attainment of the Dao:
Those who can do this
Accord with the intent of the supreme true Dao.
If one follows the Dao without deviation,
They merge with the utmost principle.
Thus the *Daoist Scripture* says:
Those who are one with the Dao,
The Dao also attains them.
This is the meaning.

The above urges reform of transgressions.
Below, it urges the establishment of meritorious deeds.
Within the section on establishing merit,
There are five distinctions:
First, urging the ransoming of lives;
Second, urging almsgiving;
Third, urging the promotion of the worthy;
Fourth, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit;
Fifth, concluding exhortations.
First, urging the ransoming of lives:
All who would embody the Dao
Must eliminate transgressions and establish merit,
Even gaining the merit of reviving others.
All who wish to embody the Dao
Must eliminate transgressions and establish merit.
If before upholding scriptures and precepts,
They personally committed killing,
They should save those on the verge of death
To make amends for past faults.
Thus, their karmic debts are erased,
And they also gain the blessing of aiding others.

This urges the ransoming of lives.
Next, urging almsgiving:
If they once robbed others of their wealth,
They should also gain the reward of bestowing kindness.
If before hearing the scriptures’ dharma,
They plundered others’ possessions,
They should now vow in heart and word,
Reflect on their faults, and make amends.
With their own private wealth,
They should bestow alms upon the poor,
Planting seeds in the field of blessings,
Establishing merit and virtue.
Thus, their past debts are settled,
And they also gain the merit of bestowing kindness.

This urges almsgiving.
Next, urging the promotion of the worthy:
If they once slandered those superior to themselves,
They should also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.
If they ever slandered those superior to themselves,
Praised the unworthy, or defamed the innocent,
Envying and resenting the noble,
They should now recommend and elevate the worthy,
Extolling those of great learning.
Thus, their past debts are erased,
And they also gain the reward of promoting the worthy.

Below, clarifying the benefits of establishing merit,
Turning misfortune into blessing:
These are true and essential words—
Their merit is immeasurable.
It urges turning from evil thoughts
To cultivate blessings and goodness.
When the Dao’s practice is established,
Its words must be treasured.
If one sees others’ faults,
They should expound the scriptures and precepts,
Enabling all—men and women alike—
To receive the dharma’s benefits.
Such merit is towering,
Boundless and immeasurable.

This clarifies the benefits.
Below, it sets forth admonitions and exhortations:
Do not think the Dao formless and become arrogant,
But diligently cultivate with reverence,
Maintaining purity of heart day and night.

The above urges the cultivation of goodness and establishment of merit.
Below, it properly urges the abandonment of transgressions.
There are two distinctions:
First, urging reform of transgressions;
Second, urging cultivation of goodness.
First, urging reform of transgressions:
If one sees people suffering from illness,
They should save and deliver them.
Seeing others in distress,
Assist them in performing blessings.
With a mind to save and deliver,
They may attain peace and stability.
Do not use cunning to deceive the foolish,
Relying on spirits and ghosts to frighten the world,
Extorting others’ wealth.
Though possessing some spiritual insight,
Do not manipulate the worthy,
Disdain the lowly,
Slander one another,
Respect the noble and shame the humble,
Delight in wealth and abandon the poor,
Hold love and hatred in duality,
Deceive with false expectations,
Refuse to follow others’ sentiments to bestow kindness,
Or indulge desires and drive others away.
Carefully consider:
Even spirits and ghosts will not comply,
And in the true dharma, there is truly no efficacy.
Instead, one’s own body will suffer calamity.

This urges reform of transgressions.
Next, urging cultivation of the Dao:
Those of like aspiration should seek one another,
Those of like dharma should befriend one another.
They must honor and receive the great scriptures,
Devoting their hearts to delighting in the Dao.
If the dharma’s teachings are not yet clear,
They should consult those who understand,
Listening and reciting with careful reception,
Not allowing forgetfulness.
They must also maintain solemn dignity,
Calming the spirit and aligning the body,
Not letting the mind wander to other thoughts,
Or indulge in drowsiness and slumber,
Engaging in idle chatter face to face—
In the end, they will gain nothing.

Here follows the translation:

---

This concludes the urging to cultivate and depart from transgressions; below clarifies the benefits gained.

If one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then boundless blessings will be received, even to the point of attaining the Dao and ascending to heaven. If one can be reverently attentive according to the dharma, then immeasurable blessings will be received, and the immortal officials who attend the scriptures will naturally come to protect them. Not only will they be free from calamity for the remainder of their lives, but they will even ascend to the heavenly halls.

The preceding long prose passage concludes here. From this point onward, verses are recited to urge the establishment of merit.

Within the verses, there are divisions: first, two and a half lines praise the establishment of merit and the benefits gained.

*"In the world there are the foolish and ignorant..."* (two and a half lines) describe the harm of evil conduct.

*"Those who delight in the dharma..."* (five lines) urge the upholding of the scriptures.

*"Seeing those who are diligent..."* (five and a half lines) present goodness in contrast to evil, urging choice between them.

Now, first recite the upholding of the scriptures:

**Honoring the Void, revering the Great Vehicle—**
**Even demons dare not list their faults.**

Honor the Void and uphold the Great Dharma.
Cut off all glory and desire, and eliminate them entirely.
Once diligence arises within the heart,
What external demon would dare to enumerate their transgressions?

This concludes the urging to establish merit; below clarifies the benefits.

**Transforming misfortune through cultivating virtue—**
**Great merit is thereby accomplished.**

If one can abandon coarse thoughts and reform to cultivate good conduct,
Then past transgressions and debts will naturally dissipate like clouds.
Virtue and power tower majestically, advancing with each passing day.
Transcending the mundane, one ascends lightly,
Utterly distinct from the world.
People must follow this great merit,
For it is thereby accomplished.

This concludes the explanation of the benefits of establishing merit; next clarifies the harm of evil conduct.

*"In the world there are foolish people..."*
Who invoke names to establish ghostly teachings,
Privately deceiving yet openly practicing them—
Ten thousand words, not one is true.

This concludes the explanation of evil conduct; next clarifies the losses incurred.

**Following the heart to perform demonic deeds—**
**Punishment and suffering arrive thus.**

Indulging one’s foolish nature to perform demonic deeds,
Corruption fills and guilt is certain.
Calamity and torment come of their own accord.
Unaware of the day of death’s approach,
Suddenly, brutal violence befalls.
The soul is imprisoned in the ghostly courts of Fengdu,
Where pain and poison reach their peak.

This concludes the explanation of the harm of evil conduct. Below urges the cultivation of the scriptural dharma.

The text is divided into two parts: first, verses praising those who believe in the dharma; then, verses praising those who listen and receive it.

First, recite those who practice the dharma:

**Those who must delight in the dharma,**
**Respect and believe, taking goodness as their cause.**
Though they may not understand the written word,
Their hearts remain sincere and earnest.
They set aside right and wrong,
Listening to and reciting the scriptural passages.

This clarifies belief in the dharma; below clarifies the benefits gained.

**Devoting the heart, the Dao is attained—**
**Virtue and power naturally fill the heavens.**

Devoting the heart, one attains the immortal Dao,
And accomplishes the supreme, perfect truth.
Simply by receiving and upholding the wondrous scriptures,
Virtue and power naturally become vast.

The preceding verses on those who believe and receive conclude here. Below recite those who listen to the dharma:

**All good men and women,**
**Focus your hearts to listen to my scripture.**
Do not face one another with idle chatter,
Nor harbor thoughts of confusion.
First, this disturbs the supreme teachings;
Second, it wearies your bodies.
Wearying the body is but self-inflicted toil,
Later receiving the retribution of dullness.
It is better to honor and serve the scriptural Dao,
And never again slight the divine spirits.

The preceding urging to uphold the scriptures concludes here. Below presents goodness in contrast to evil to urge choice between them.

The text is divided into two: first, presenting good and evil to urge choice; then, urging cultivation of the Dao to clarify the benefits gained.

The first part is further divided: first, one line presents goodness to urge its adoption; then, five lines present evil to urge its abandonment.

First, urging the adoption of goodness:

**Seeing those who are diligent—**
**Learning is thus not at all difficult.**

Seeing those who are diligent,
Abandoning the secular to cultivate the scriptural Dao,
They will surely attain immortality and transcend the world.
Then, they will fill the heavenly offices,
Ascending high and soaring beyond the mundane,
Flying beyond the bounds of the Brahma realms.
Through cultivation and learning, this is attained—
Truly, it is not difficult.

This concludes the urging to adopt goodness; below urges the abandonment of evil.

**Why cling to the impure and beautiful?**
**Alone, you will fall to heavenly ruin.**

This laments that people of this age are submerged in worldly dust,
Not aspiring to ascend in spirit and soar lightly,
Or wander and feast in the mysterious capital.
Instead, they will be bound to the northern gate,
Revolving through the five destinies,
Wailing beside cauldrons of boiling water,
Shrieking atop blades and swords.
Their faces and bodies endure hardship,
Scorched by hunger and cold.
Begging for food, they find no place to turn.
Heavenly punishments are fully applied,
Their bodies suffer torment,
For kalpas upon kalpas, through countless years.
All because they slandered the worthy and good,
Disbelieved in past lives,
Persisted in evil without reform,
And thus brought about their own heavenly ruin.

This concludes the urging to adopt goodness and abandon evil. Below urges cultivation of the Dao:

**Nothing compares to cultivating the great Dao—**
**The host of sages will gather with you.**

Nothing compares to cultivating the scriptures and propagating the Dao,
Illuminating the dharma gate,
So that you may befriend the host of perfected immortals.

The preceding verses urging the establishment of merit conclude here. Below summarizes the urging to cultivate goodness and the benefits gained.

The text is divided into two: first, clarifying the benefits of self-cultivation; then, urging reverence and secrecy.

After Laozi finished reciting the verses, he addressed Daoling, saying:
"In times past, through countless kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in boundless and limitless eras, I cultivated this chapter, chanting its verses, practicing its rituals, and playing with its words, thereby attaining my present retribution. Its purport is subtle and profound, the mystery within the mystery. Now I tell you this in earnest—revere it well, and do not reveal it to those who lack faith."

Should any harbor doubt or slander, their lineage shall be extinguished to the last.

The Most High Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: "In kalpas past beyond count, I cultivated these scriptural verses, chanting their meaning, practicing their rites with diligent devotion, and thus attained the supreme Dao-fruit of this day. Know that the purport of this scripture is profound and far-reaching, the mystery within the mystery."

Here concludes the exposition of its benefits; below urges reverence and secrecy. Now I earnestly tell you—hold it in deepest respect, for the consequences of transgression extend to the annihilation of one’s lineage. This great scripture I now proclaim to you; receive it with utmost care, cherish the Dao with fervent devotion, and transmit it no further. Should others doubt or revile it, their lineage shall be extinguished.

Here ends the urging to establish meritorious deeds. Below begins the fourth major section of the preceding text, which exhorts the method of scripture cultivation, comprising both prose and verse. Within the prose, there are two divisions: first, presenting the dual conditions of good and evil to illustrate human life and destiny; then, setting forth the scriptural precepts to urge cultivation. The first division is further divided into two: first, the evils of life and death; then, the matters of karmic retribution. Within the former, there are four parts: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the shared desire for evil; third, the failure to attain one’s desires; fourth, the concluding exhortation to relinquish. We begin with the ignorance of the worldly.

Lord Lao addressed Daoling, saying: "Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble. Yet dwelling between Heaven and Earth, all know the day of their birth but not the day of their death. Whether good or evil, wealthy or poor, each wishes for long life—who desires an early demise? Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? Only by not being born can one avoid this difficulty. Yet even this class has its causes and conditions: those who cultivate goodness receive goodness, and their spirits become good; those who commit evil receive evil, and their spirits become evil. Thus, half reside in the halls of my Dao, and half in demonic hells. It is like an echo—none fails to receive a response.

Human lifespan is ordained by the Void. The Void does not speak, so sages were established. Sages concealed their forms, leaving behind scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are called the Dao. They urge people to do good, teaching them to cultivate life, first to eliminate transgressions, second to attain immortality. Not only does one avoid death, but one becomes a perfected immortal. Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings of wine and meat to spirits. They arise solely from the reverent observance of scriptures and precepts by worthy Daoists through diligent practice. First suffering, then reward—its response is clear as day.

Of all that Heaven and Earth generate, humans are the most noble. Yet the foolish, clouded by delusion, lack clear wisdom. They know only the day of their birth and their wealth or rank, not the hour of their death."

Here concludes the exposition of worldly ignorance; next, the shared desires of high and low.

"Whether good or evil, all share the same aspirations: to be wealthy, noble, and long-lived. Who would wish for poverty and an early death?"

Here concludes the exposition of shared desires for evil; next, the failure to attain one’s desires.

"Death is what humans do not delight in, yet how can any escape it? The body perishes, the soul departs—all abhor this, yet who can avoid it?"

Below, the concluding exhortation: only by not being born can one avoid this. Though one may seek to avoid death, it is better still not to be born. Refine the body and return to the True—what affliction remains?

Here concludes the exposition of the joys and sorrows of life and death to urge relinquishment; below, the matters of karmic retribution.

"Yet even this class has its causes and conditions—good and evil actions differ, and so do their karmic retributions. Thus, as spirits, their fates diverge, some ascending, some sinking. It is like an echo responding to a call, or a seed yielding its fruit."

This presents the causes and conditions of good and evil to awaken understanding. Below, the proper exposition of scriptural methods to urge cultivation. Within this section, there are three divisions: first, presenting the scriptures to urge; second, clarifying the benefits of the scriptures; third, explaining the methods of upholding the scriptures. We begin with presenting the scriptures to urge.

"Human life is ordained by the Void, so sages were established to expound scriptures and precepts. These scriptures and precepts are the Dao itself. Those who propagate the Dharma thereby attain the True Dao."

Here concludes the presentation of the scriptures to urge; next, the benefits of cultivating the scriptures.

"Urging people to do good and teaching them to cultivate life—those who uphold the scriptures prolong their years. Not only do they avoid death, but they attain the True Dao and become immortals."

Here concludes the exposition of the benefits of upholding the scriptures; below, the methods of cultivation.

"Such blessings cannot be obtained by seeking wealth or status, nor by offerings to spirits. Only through upholding the scriptures, observing the precepts, and enduring hardship in self-cultivation does the reward become as radiant as the sun and moon."

Here concludes the prose on upholding the scriptures; below, verses exhort the same. Within this section, there are two parts: first, five lines urging the abandonment of evil to heed the scriptures—*Why not diligently ascend the Dao?*; then, one and a half lines urging diligent devotion to reform the Dao. The first part is further divided into three: first, the ignorance of the worldly; second, the divergent fates of ascent and descent; third, the exhortation to the scriptural Dharma.

Thus, Lord Lao spoke in verse:

"Humans are the most noble,
Yet take no joy in the Dharma’s splendor.
Life and death follow their course,
None know where they shall go.
In darkness they seek without knowing,
Only at retribution’s hour do they awaken.
The wicked enter the three torments,
The good obtain great mercy.
If one accords with the True,
Hear the scriptures, contemplate goodness.
Do not feign deafness and blindness,
Hearing the Dharma yet pretending folly.
I pity all heavenly and mortal beings,
Thus I leave these supreme words,
The great Dharma for humanity,
The excellent physician for the world."

Wealth and bribes should be used in accordance with the Dao,
Do not pray to deviant shrines.
Ten million times, not a single return,
While malevolent qi brings daily increasing calamity.
Why not diligently follow the Supreme Dao,
Seeing the Dharma and devising plans in the heart?

The wicked receive wicked retribution,
Yet it is better to establish a foundation of goodness.
Through苦行 one obtains sweet reward,
Naturally ascending the Mystic Terrace.

The preceding verses admonish the ignorance of the worldly,
That humans are most noble,
Yet only at retribution’s hour do they awaken.
Between Heaven and Earth,
Only humans are noble—
Why not diligently cultivate the scriptures,
Delighting in purity and splendor?
Instead, they surrender to fate, unaware of life and death’s course,
Wandering in endless darkness,
Only realizing at retribution’s hour.

This concludes the exposition on the ignorance of the worldly.
Next, it distinguishes the divergent fates of ascent and descent:
The wicked enter the three torments,
The good obtain great mercy.
The wicked descend into hell,
Where body and soul suffer thrice daily;
The good ascend to heaven,
Where the Great Sage, in compassion, welcomes and guides them.

This concludes the distinction of divergent fates.
Next, it exhorts listening to the Dharma:
If one accords with the True,
Hearing the scriptures and contemplating goodness,
To the point of "malevolent qi brings daily increasing calamity."
If one accords with the True,
One must contemplate goodness and listen to the scriptures,
Never feigning deafness and blindness,
Hearing the Dharma yet pretending folly.

The Great Sage pities all heavenly and mortal beings,
Thus leaving these supreme teachings,
The great Dharma for humanity,
The excellent physician for the world.
Wealth should be used in accordance with the Dao,
Never praying to deviant shrines or spirits.
Ten million times, there is no return,
While malevolent qi grows daily.

This concludes the exhortation to abandon evil;
Next, it urges cultivation of the Dao:
Why not strive for the Supreme Dao,
Naturally ascending the Mystic Terrace?
Why not diligently cultivate the Supreme Dao,
Seeing the Dharma and devising plans in the heart?
Acting wickedly brings wicked retribution—
Better to establish a foundation of goodness.
Through苦行, the reward is naturally sweet,
Serenely upon the Mystic Terrace.

Thus far, the exhortation to uphold the scriptural Dharma concludes.
Hereafter begins the second major section,
Which urges adherence to the Five Precepts.
Within this section, there are both prose and verse.
In the prose, five distinctions are made:
First, citing evil to urge its abandonment;
Second, citing the precepts to urge cultivation;
Third, clarifying the benefits of upholding the precepts;
Fourth, clarifying the losses of transgressors;
Fifth, exhorting secrecy and caution.

First, urging the abandonment of evil:
The Dao states: Sensual desire ruins affairs—
It must not be indulged.
Yet all in the world, wise or foolish, noble or base, share the same desires.
Only Daoists can hold fast to their resolve,
Firmly upholding the teachings and precepts,
Restraining themselves,
In conduct and movement, their hearts never inclining toward deviance.
Amidst love and desire,
They never transgress even once.
When they see beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,
They cover their eyes with the precepts;
When they hear praise or blame, or the five tones,
They seal their ears with the precepts;
When they encounter the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant delicacies,
They shut their mouths with the precepts;
When they crave wealth, the seven treasures, or rare jewels,
Indulging their passions to excess,
They subdue their hearts with the precepts;
When their minds incline toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,
They break their feet with the precepts.

Those who can practice these five
Will cause their seven ancestors to be born in heaven,
Clothed and fed naturally,
Their bodies attaining immortality,
Ascending at dawn in broad daylight.
If they undergo liberation by means of the corpse,
They will transform and become perfected.
The worthy, with sincere devotion, uphold these precepts.
If men or women cannot accept and practice them,
There is nothing to be done—
I would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces
Than write these words.

Dao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,
Do not leak the true scripture.
Attachment to sensual desire and emotion
Destroys oneself and ruins the body.
Worldly people cannot relinquish these.
This concludes the urging to abandon evil;
Next, citing the precepts to urge cultivation.

First, describing the upholder of the precepts,
Then, the precepts themselves.
Only Daoists,
To the point of "never transgressing even once";
Only Daoists,
Alone able to awaken and understand,
Firmly upholding the teachings and precepts,
Restraining body and mind,
Even amidst love and desire,
Never violating them.

This concludes the description of the upholder of the precepts;
Next, the precepts themselves:
When seeing beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor,
Cover the eyes with the precepts, allowing no gaze;
When hearing the five tones, lewd sounds, or seductive music,
Seal the ears with the precepts, allowing no hearing;
When encountering the eight delicacies or sweet, fragrant dishes,
Shut the mouth with the precepts, allowing no tasting;
When desiring money, rare treasures, or exotic goods,
Subdue the heart with the precepts, restraining thoughts and desires;
When inclined toward lewdness or covetous, wicked deeds,
Break the feet with the precepts, preventing them from moving.

This concludes the explanation of the precepts;
Next, the benefits of upholding them.
Having described the practice of these five,
Next, the losses of transgressors:
If men or women cannot accept and practice them,
To the point of "I would rather give someone ten thousand gold pieces than write these words."
Lamenting that people of the age value wealth and despise the Dao,
Thus these words are spoken.
Together they sink and drown—what can be done?
This concludes the explanation of the losses of transgressors;
Next, exhorting transmission.

Dao-ling, you must choose whom to transmit this to,
Do not leak the true scripture.
If a person of reverence and faith,
Possessing the ten superior qualities,
Comes seeking to receive it,
First offer gold as a token of sincerity,
Test them to ensure no retreat,
Then entrust the scripture to them.
If they hesitate or doubt,
Keep it secret and do not transmit it.

This concludes the prose;
Below are the verses.
In the verses, four distinctions are made:
First, three and a half lines on the losses of those who do not uphold the precepts;
Second, three and a half lines on the benefits of upholding the precepts;
Third, three lines on abandoning the five kinds of evil;
Fourth, two and a half lines on the benefits of reforming transgressions.

The Most High Lord Lao then spoke in verse:

"What is desire?
It all arises from the heart."

The eyes behold radiant beauty,
The ears drink in the five tones,
The mouth savors the eight delicacies,
The heart covets wealth and glory,
The mind lusts after lewd and wicked deeds,
The hands and feet carry them out.

When the five evils are not restrained,
Judgment appears in the omen’s form,
Forever cut off from the Way of life,
The dark soul sinks into the ghostly prison.
When the sentence is served and they emerge,
They are human in form but lack feeling.

Those who uphold the precepts and do no evil
Seal the five gates of the heart:
The eyes do not gaze on alluring appearances,
The ears do not seek clamorous sounds,
The mouth does not feast on sweet delights,
The heart does not love money and wealth,
The mind harbors no impure thoughts,
The hands and feet do not act on them.

When the five evils are stilled and cease,
How can judgment be pronounced?
Forever united with the true Dao,
No longer do they fall to the ghostly officials.
Merit accumulates from the precepts,
And they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Dawn.

The eye treats beauty as an enemy,
Never wishing to see it once;
The ear treats sound as a foe,
Never desiring to hear it;
The mouth treats flavor as bitterness,
Never allowing itself to be tainted;
The heart treats treasure as fault,
Never indulging in longing;
The mind treats wickedness as a thief,
Never wishing to share its path;
The feet treat the level path as an obstacle,
Never delighting to tread its course.

The five sufferings share one road,
Never inclining toward perverse views.
Those who can do this
Are called the rarest of the rare.
Having mastered what is difficult,
Impurities have no place to linger.
The body is pure, the spirit at peace,
The August One guards the cinnabar field.
Conduct perfected arises from cause,
Thus they ascend to the heavens above.

"What is desire?
It all arises from the heart."
The first "desire" refers to the mind of covetousness,
The second "desire" to the objects of greed.
From where do these two minds arise?
All from one’s own inverted and deluded thoughts.

This concludes the general statement;
Below are the particulars.
From "The eyes behold radiant beauty" to "the hands and feet carry them out":
The eyes recklessly gaze on the five colors,
The ears indiscriminately take in the five sounds,
The mouth relishes rich and crisp flavors,
The heart schemes for bribes and goods,
The mind, lusting after evil deeds,
The hands and feet then carry them out.

This clarifies the commission of evil;
Below, the losses are made clear.
From "When the five evils are not restrained" to "they are human in form but lack feeling":
When the five desires of the heart are unrestrained,
Disaster and judgment appear in the omen’s form,
Forever cut off from the Way of long life,
The dark soul sinks into the ghostly prison.
When the sentence is served and they emerge to receive form,
Their six senses are incomplete.

This concludes the explanation of the harm from violating the precepts;
Below, the benefits of upholding the precepts are made clear.
"Those who uphold the precepts and do no evil,
Seal the five gates of desire"—this is the general statement.
Below are the particulars:
From "The eyes do not gaze on alluring appearances" to "the hands and feet do not act on them":
The eyes do not behold beauty,
The ears do not seek sounds,
The mouth does not taste sweetness,
The heart does not accept wealth,
Even the mind harbors no external thoughts,
The feet do not wander recklessly.

This concludes the explanation of upholding the precepts;
Below, the benefits are made clear.
From "When the five evils are stilled and cease" to "they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Dawn":
When the five desires of the heart are stilled and cease,
How can judgment be falsely imposed?
Forever united with the true Dao,
No longer do they sink into the ghostly prison.
Merit accumulates from the precepts,
And they ascend in broad daylight to the Jade Capital.

This concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts;
Next, the ability to abandon the five kinds of evil is expounded.
From "The eye treats beauty as an enemy" to "never delighting to tread its course":
The eye treats beauty as an enemy,
Never allowing itself a single glance;
The ear treats sound as a foe,
Never permitting itself to hear;
The mouth finds flavor bitter,
Never allowing itself to be tainted;
The heart treats treasure as fault,
Never indulging in longing;
The mind treats wickedness as a thief,
Never wishing to share its path;
The feet treat the level path as an obstacle,
Never delighting to tread its course.

This concludes the explanation of abandoning the five kinds of evil;
Below, the benefits are made clear.
From "The five sufferings share one road" to "thus they ascend to the heavens above":
The five desires arise from one mind,
Never inclining toward perverse and deluded attachments.
Those who can thus abandon them
Are called the rarest of the rare.
Having mastered what is difficult,
Impurities have no place to linger.
The body is pure, the spirit at peace,
The August One abides in the cinnabar field.
Conduct perfected arises from the precepts,
Thus they attain the Way of soaring emptiness.

This concludes the explanation of the benefits of upholding the precepts.
From here onward is the sixth major section,
Which exhorts the upholding of the scripture and cultivation of practice,
To clarify the benefits.
Within this text, there are four distinctions:
First, cultivation of practice to abandon evil;
Second, establishing resolve to uphold the scripture;
Third, the benefits of practicing the scripture;
Fourth, a warning against careless transmission.

The preceding text has two parts:
First, an exhortation to cultivate the Dao;
Next, an exhortation to abandon evil.
It speaks only of preserving the Dao:
"In upholding the Dharma and cultivating the Dao, be diligent;
In cultivating the body, be steadfast;
In advancing, be enduring;
In upholding the precepts, be firm;
In focused thought, be unwavering;
In careful contemplation, never depart from the Dao.
Abandon evil, abandon delusion,
Abandon demonic influences, abandon deceit,
Abandon lewdness, abandon desire,
Cast aside all wrongdoing,
Thus embracing the true to attain ascent to the heavens.
This is to labor first and receive reward later,
To transcend the mortal body and ascend as an immortal.
Look to the future, not merely the present.
Evil brings no immediate calamity,
Good brings no immediate blessing.
Reflect carefully on this,
Devote yourself earnestly to the task,
Exert your strength in upholding the scripture and Dharma."

This scripture is lofty and wondrous,
Encompassing the Three Caverns,
The supreme, most true, and foremost mysterious chapter.
Those who receive and uphold it
Are unexcelled among humanity.
Without the mysterious name,
Not one in ten thousand will see it.

Those with sincere intent should approach this as one parched and starving seeks food and drink, as one freezing seeks winter garments, or one sweltering seeks spring raiment; as the destitute finding treasure, or the lowly attaining rank. As one toiling desperately seeks rest, weary and longing for sleep; as one yearning, desiring fulfillment. Upon obtaining this scripture and Dharma, cultivate this resolve: endure hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.

This scripture has delivered countless souls. Those who cultivate the Dao and recite it shall attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear and reciting it shall be untouched by demons; the ill reciting it shall rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it shall find natural joy; officials reciting it shall see their prison gates stay closed. If recited for the deceased, they shall rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it shall secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it shall all have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it shall gain wisdom and sagacity.

One who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin, delivers limitless beings, and nourishes the Ten Heavens. Without distinction of high or low, great or small, boundless and infinite, all receive the grace of compassion. You must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty.

Dao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.

Those who wish to uphold the scriptural precepts, study the Dao, and cultivate the body must fortify their resolve with sincerity, focus their thoughts with clarity, and keep the Dao in their hearts whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. This admonition to maintain mindfulness is followed by the exhortation to abandon evil and delusion, demonic influences and deceit, to the point of not being swayed by immediate pleasures. One must cast aside the six kinds of wrongdoing and embrace the true nature. Though the labor comes first, ascension to immortality follows. One should anticipate future rewards rather than seek present gratification.

This exhortation to forsake evil is followed by the encouragement to uphold the scriptures. It is divided into three parts: first, a direct exhortation; second, an illustrative exhortation; and third, a synthesis of the analogy. The preceding text is further divided: first, the encouragement to uphold the scriptures, then the praise of the scripture’s exalted virtue.

Here begins the first part. Though evil brings no immediate calamity and good no immediate blessing, the transformation wrought by blessings and virtue is inevitable. One should therefore devote oneself earnestly to receiving the scriptural Dharma. This concludes the encouragement to receive the scriptures, followed by praise of the Dharma.

This scripture is lofty and wondrous, encompassing the Three Caverns, supreme and most true, the foremost of the mysterious. As the scripture is exalted, so too are those who receive it. Without the mysterious name and the bone of an immortal, one will never encounter this scripture. This concludes the praise of the Dharma. Below, an analogy is drawn: those with sincere intent should be like one parched and starving seeking food and drink, to the point of yearning for fulfillment. This concludes the analogy, followed by the synthesis: upon seeing this scripture and Dharma, one should cultivate this resolve, enduring hardship in accordance with the Dao, and boundless blessings shall follow.

The eight contemplations above, if pursued with diligence and in accordance with the Dao, will bring limitless blessings. This concludes the encouragement to uphold and recite the scriptures, followed by the enumeration of its benefits.

This scripture has delivered countless beings, and its ten blessings are as follows: those who cultivate the Dao and recite it attain the rank of Perfected; those in fear reciting it are untouched by demons; the ill reciting it rise from their deathbeds; the distressed reciting it find natural joy; officials reciting it see their prison gates stay closed; if recited for the deceased, they rest in peace; the impoverished reciting it secure wealth; those facing mortal peril reciting it have their lives extended; the ignorant reciting it gain wisdom and sagacity; and one who recites it bestows blessings upon nine generations of kin. This concludes the ten blessings of the scripture, followed by the expounding of its vast and far-reaching merits.

It delivers limitless beings, its grace flows through the Ten Heavens, without distinction of high or low, boundless and infinite, all bathed in its compassion. The blessings of this scripture are beyond comprehension, nourishing the Ten Heavens and flowing through all realms. This concludes the praise of the scripture’s benefits, followed by the warning against careless transmission.

You must guard this secret—take care not to recklessly disseminate it. To carelessly reveal the scripture or transmit it to the unworthy invites the judgment of wind-knives and consignment to the courts of ghosts. You would do well to heed this; my words are not empty. This concludes the warning, followed by the Heavenly Master’s reception of the teaching. Dao Ling bowed in reverence, expressed gratitude, and departed.

Here concludes the scroll on the "Harmonious Practice" of the *Supreme Pervading Mystery Inner Teachings of the Numinous Treasure*. Next, the assembly shall convene at Penglai, where the revelation of the great and manifest truth shall be expounded.

Then the Heavenly Master inquired further, saying: "How may one be delivered from the myriad perils of the world?"

The Most High Lord of Dao replied with a verse:

The Way of Heaven and Earth is boundless,
The mud-pill palace of the head is void and empty.
If you have not once vowed to uphold the precepts,
How can you hope to hear and recite the scriptures and commandments?

Those who fail to understand this
Will toil in vain and gain nothing.
They delight in superficial sentiment without true devotion,
And though they seek, they shall not attain.

Next, the text exhorts reverence and secrecy:

Having spoken the verse, the Lord of Dao addressed Dao Ling, saying: "You must constantly guard these teachings in the depths of your heart. Those who recklessly disclose them shall incur the wrath of the Three Officers and be bound in the Nine Darknesses. Their lifespan shall be cut short, their plans thwarted, and their wealth scattered. This is the gravest of transgressions.

Only by embracing the truth and preserving the scripture’s secrecy may one ascend to the Eight Effulgences, emerge from the cycle of suffering, and attain treasures beyond measure."
