The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: "I contemplate the myriad beings, foolish and deluded, their divided spirits dispersed and transformed, filling the ten directions and boundless worlds—both in heaven and among men—all kings. I expound the scriptures and unfold the teachings, adapting to the depth or shallowness of each age, guiding sentient beings to return to the path of goodness, forever casting off afflictions, ascending to the ground of liberation, and entering the gate of the true Dharma.

Thus, I transform my body, responding to karmic conditions and resonances, dispersing radiance in accordance with circumstances, harmonizing with the world’s light. I comfort and receive humans and celestials, skillfully exhorting with expedient means, laboring humbly, enduring hardship, and bringing peace to all beings. At times, I manifest a great body filling the void of space; at others, a small form entering the tiniest speck of dust. I may appear as a sovereign, a heavenly king, a master of the age, or a chief minister; as a worthy, a Daoist, a learned Confucian scholar, a governor, a great minister, a crown prince, a consort, a queen, a loyal and upright official aiding the ruler. I establish the Dharma to teach people, exhorting and transforming the foolish and base, universally enabling them to depart from suffering, all entering the root of faith, turning toward the utmost truth, accomplishing the supreme Dao, forever ascending to eternal joy, abiding in tranquility, merging with the void, without birth or extinction. The saints of the ten directions all return to this root."

The Supreme Dao Lord bowed and inquired, saying: "Sentient beings are weak and inferior, their perceptions shallow. Though they behold the scriptures, they cannot believe or comprehend them. How may they be awakened and their doubts severed?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Sentient beings are foolish and dull, their root-nature dim and feeble, like children whose wisdom is yet unilluminated. They must be gradually guided, skillfully led to awakening. How could they suddenly enter the true and real? It is like a compassionate mother nurturing her beloved child, gradually instructing and disciplining them. Their wisdom grows and brightens, and as they dwell among men, there is nothing they do not understand. Their learning excels, and they become great persons. To exhort and guide the common and foolish is likewise: through gradual progression, they ascend to the mysterious."

The Supreme Lord asked: "If the scriptural teachings are to be entrusted to the kings of nations, what is the intent?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "I pervade the ten directions, teaching and transforming, expounding the Dharma, exhorting celestials and humans. I divide realms and territories, establish boundaries and domains, appoint rulers and sovereigns, adapting to customs and the times, setting forth regulations and institutions with skillful expedience. All this is but to bring peace to sentient beings and awaken all.

The kings of nations may be incarnations of sagely perfected immortals descending to the world to teach and transform humanity. Heavenly emperors and kings may be reborn in the mortal realm as parents of men, or stellar essences may descend to earth, or auspicious qi may bestow its numen, or past blessings may be repaid, or former causes may confer attainment. Whether in heaven or among men, they govern and transform multitudes, serving as the foremost of teachers. All scriptures and Dharmas are entrusted to kings, that they may revere the Dao and deliver people. How then, today, do you harbor this doubt?"

The Supreme Dao Lord petitioned, saying: "In the past, I traveled with the Heavenly Worthy through the ten directions, teaching and transforming kings, expounding the Dharma to deliver people. Though the precepts, regulations, and rituals have been transmitted to the world, instructing kings to practice the Dao, I have not seen them explicitly entrusted to rulers. Thus, today I dare to pose this inquiry."

Having received the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthy, who broadly expounded the teachings, I realize that the rise and fall of the scriptural Dharma all depend upon this. I pray that from this day forward, all sacred teachings be entrusted to kings."

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: "Now I universally declare to the boundless worlds in the ten directions, above in heaven and below on earth, to all heavenly emperors, kings, crown princes, consorts, queens, chief ministers, and great officials who govern and lead the people, practicing the kingly teachings: each of you must heed these words of mine. In the past, present, and future, I entrust the scriptural teachings to you. You, all kings, must propagate the Dao to save beings and deliver celestials and humans."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Kings of nations must first establish temples to deliver people, maintaining and supporting them. They shall guide all men and women to return to the true Dao and forever abandon the causes of suffering. They shall command chief ministers, great officials, crown princes, consorts, and queens in all places to erect Dharma seats in hundreds, thousands, and myriads, widely summoning Daoists who clearly comprehend the scriptural teachings. They shall constantly expound the wondrous principles, lecturing on the Great Vehicle, the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns, and the abstruse purport of the Seven Sections. Thus, those near and far shall awaken, and all shall hear and know. May the nation be peaceful, the people joyful, the living and deceased attain fruition, hells be stilled, men and women become wise and virtuous, all depart from suffering, perfect the true Dao, and eternally rejoice in spontaneity."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Next, they shall create images of all forms—true, responsive, and transformed bodies; the Heavenly Worthies of the past, future, and present; the Three Ages and Ten Directions; the Three Realms; perfected immortals and sagely beings; jade maidens and immortal youths; vajra spirit-kings; left and right incense officials; dragon and tiger lords, and so forth. According to what is available, they may use gold, silver, pearls, jade, embroidery, painting, carving, molding clay, chiseling niches, sculpting stone, carving ivory, engraving bone, printing on paper, or drawing pictures. With a single thought of resolve, they may act according to their means, great or small. Whether adorned or plain, each shall do their utmost in their time, revering them as they would my own body, making offerings with utmost sincerity. According to their devotion, they shall receive blessings, and their karmic retribution shall be unfailing. Thus, all in heaven and on earth shall take refuge and pay homage, and the hidden and manifest shall receive blessings. The merit and virtue shall be unfathomable."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Next, they shall copy the thirty-six sections of all scriptures in golden script and jade characters, erecting steles and monuments. Whether on fine paper or silk, in clerical or seal script, refined or unpolished, they shall act according to their devotion. They shall circulate them far and wide, adorning them with scrolls and cases, storing them in boxes and cabinets. They shall collate the characters, standardize the volumes, and uniformly distribute them among celestials and humans, transmitting them to men and women. They shall constantly cause them to be recited and read, praying for the nation’s peace and the people’s happiness."

Let the Daoist masters expound upon the wondrous principles, disseminating the great transformation, that all may hear and know. May every sentient being awaken to the Dao, recognizing the body as fleeting illusion, its gathering and dispersal but a momentary breath—neither impure nor foul, yet bound by false thoughts and afflictions, ceaselessly tormented day and night, thought after thought in impermanence, beset by birth, aging, sickness, and death. The fame and profit of the world are fundamentally empty. Inwardly observe this body: it has no fixed abode. One must rely on the true Dao to subdue the deluded mind, forever severing ignorance, ever ascending to liberation, transcending life and death, and abiding in serene purity.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly construct halls and palaces, towers and pavilions, separate kitchens for fasting, and various auxiliary chambers—masters’ quarters, lecture halls, and all that sacred grounds require. They shall repair and build anew, mend old dwellings, and protect against decay, ensuring they endure forever, never reduced to ruins. They shall widely deliver the people, diligently safeguarding them, exhorting men and women to pay homage and take refuge. May the nation know peace, the Daoist teachings flourish, and merit and virtue be boundless, beyond all reckoning."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly craft bells and chimes, banners and floral canopies, ritual furnishings, seats and cushions, incense burners and washing vessels, cloth covers and scripture cases, ruyi scepters and dusters, ceremonial umbrellas and staffs, fragrant mountains and jeweled trees, and all manner of implements—gold, silver, pearls, and jade—to offer in devotion to the scriptures, the Dao, and the ordained Daoist masters. May the nation know peace. Exhort all men and women to universally awaken good hearts, equally take refuge, and forever abandon dualistic thoughts. The merit of such offerings is beyond all reckoning."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly make Daoist robes and vestments, crowns and shoes, swords and staffs, riding chairs and sitting cushions, bedding and curtains, eating utensils and chopsticks, towels and knives, combs and boxes—all the requisites for the ordained—to offer in devotion to the Daoist masters. May the nation know peace. May they perpetually uphold the true Dharma for all beings, dispense healing medicines, and cure the people, guiding them onto the bridge of the Dharma to escape the sea of birth and death. Together with all men and women, may they ascend to the Jade Clarity."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly bestow gold, silver, pearls, and jade; silks and brocades; clothing and utensils; carriages, camels, and horses; fields, gardens, and dwellings; servants and playthings; incense, flowers, lamps, and candles; food and delicacies; rice and wheat—all to be dedicated to the sacred precincts, offered to the Heavenly Worthies, the scriptures and the Dao, the mountain-dwelling Daoists, the ordained Dharma-body, those observing fasts and taking the midday meal, the poor, the aged, the sick, prisoners, laborers, birds, beasts, insects, and fish—universally bestowing upon all. May the nation know peace, the hundred grains flourish, the people rejoice, the world prosper, the land be at peace, and merit and virtue tower so high as to be beyond measure."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly practice compassion, releasing life and ransoming lives, pardoning prisoners, absolving capital offenses, rescuing those in peril and distress, healing men and women, widely establishing fields of merit, and hosting vegetarian feasts. They shall free their servants and bondservants, allowing them to leave the household life. Practicing great compassion, they shall bring peace and joy to all—even birds, beasts, plants, insects, and fish. May the nation know peace, and all universally rejoice. The merit is most weighty, beyond all reckoning."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly offer fragrant oils to the mysterious altars and numinous oratories, and to all places where scriptures and images of the sacred and true manifestations reside, in devotion to the boundless Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, and to the host of immortals, perfected beings, and sages of the past, present, and future. May all be remembered with reverence. May the nation know peace. May the fragrance of flowers illuminate the Three Realms, the ten directions of the Daoist realms, and the five hundred million heavens. Whether sacred or ordinary, may all be bathed in clarity, universally perceive the fragrance, and together behold the radiance. May men and women of sincere heart equally take refuge, forever depart from darkness, and eternally enjoy the natural state."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly repair and create sacred images, scriptures, mysterious altars, and holy traces, ensuring their forms are resplendent with light, their texts orderly and complete, their halls and temples wondrously beautiful, and their foundations broad and level. When washing and adorning the true visages or embellishing the scrolls, they shall keep them ever pure. May the nation know peace, the people rejoice, and all the multitudes celebrate. May men and women be dignified and grave, their countenances like blossoms. In past lives, may they have been endowed with the six senses, wisdom and intelligence, and boundless lifespans. May the world be at peace, all enjoy tranquility, the ten directions and Three Realms praise their virtuous deeds, and they long enjoy blessings and immortality, together attaining the true Dao."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly maintain ever-burning lamps in all numinous oratories, ensuring they shine day and night without cease, aiding the light of Heaven. May the nation know peace, weapons remain sheathed, floods and fires be quelled, malevolent spirits vanish, illnesses be healed, all disasters forever extinguished, and misfortunes never arise. May lifespans be prolonged, the land enjoy peace, the heavens rejoice, the sacred hosts descend, and both the living and the dead receive grace. May humans and celestials alike partake of blessings."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly provide for the Daoist masters, supplying all their needs—fragrant oils, food and drink, ritual robes, and ritual implements. May the nation know peace, benevolence and righteousness naturally arise, propriety and education naturally flourish, men and women prosper in joy, and the land be at peace. Auspicious signs shall daily appear, good omens converge, sweet dew and nectar fill the countryside, and all the people rejoice as the hundred grains flourish."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly summon the Daoist masters to establish the myriad fasts of the Three Caverns, perform the Dao, pay homage, and repent, burning incense and lighting lamps to atone for the boundless sins of the living and the dead. May the nation know peace, and both the living and the dead rejoice together. The Four Heavenly Kings and the ten divine hosts shall burn incense and scatter flowers, floating through the air to come. The scrolls of merit and demerit shall be recorded, and their virtues listed in the Upper Clarity. May all under Heaven rejoice, the nation prosper, and the people thrive."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly, on the first, fifteenth, and last days of the month; the ten auspicious days and eight solar terms; the jiazi and gengshen days; the Three Origins, Five La festivals, and the three annual assemblies of one’s birth star; and all other propitious occasions, establish fasts, perform the Dao, venerate the Three Treasures, bestow alms upon the poor and destitute, release prisoners, absolve capital offenses, ransom lives, free bondservants to join the good, widely practice compassionate rescue, greatly establish fields of merit, and perform all manner of virtuous deeds."

May the nation know peace, heaven and humanity rejoice together, immortals and sages descend, wind and rain harmonize, illness never arise, men and women flourish, and the land prosper.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "At dawn and dusk, they shall constantly pay homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and Three Realms who have attained the Dao, and to the boundless host of saints. They shall repent and atone for the sins of the living and the dead, beseeching the removal of their names from the register of death and their inscription in the record of long life. They shall burn incense, scatter flowers, and diligently perform these rites without negligence.

May the nation know peace, lives be prolonged, the imperial line endure without end, descendants be worthy and filial, wisdom and intelligence abound, sacrifices continue unbroken, and all under Heaven enjoy great peace."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly summon Daoist masters to recite and expound all the scriptures of the Three Caverns, and to copy and collate them.

May the nation know peace, weapons of war fall silent, floods and droughts cease, all grains ripen, the myriad people rejoice, men and women celebrate, illness be healed, divine mushrooms and sacred herbs grow in the palace courtyards, the four seasons follow their proper course, the stars and constellations shine brightly, malevolent disasters vanish, and auspicious signs flourish."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly seek out Daoist masters to receive the precepts, talismans, and registers of the Three Caverns, wear them upon their persons, and regulate their hearts and mouths. They shall harmonize and rectify the spirits within their bodies, follow the rituals in their practice, and diligently perform these rites day and night for the benefit of all.

May the nation know peace, the Three Realms show reverence and protection, the Five Emperors lend their support, demon kings submit, all evil spirits show deference, the heavens bestow blessings, their names be inscribed in the Palace of Immortals, and they ascend to the Upper Clarity to eternally enjoy the natural state."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "They shall constantly encourage all men and women to receive the precepts and perform repentance from Daoist masters and dharma teachers, to cease wrongdoing and prevent transgressions, and to dissolve the burden of their sins.

May the nation know peace, benevolent spirits offer protection, all evil vanish, illness be healed, men and women be chaste and virtuous, rulers trust their ministers and ministers remain loyal, superiors and inferiors live in harmony, the Three Luminaries follow their proper course, the four seasons proceed in order, plants and trees flourish, and the nation be wealthy and the people prosperous."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "On the first days of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months, in palace courtyards, city gates, thoroughfares, marketplaces, lanes and alleys, gate pavilions, public spaces, dark altars, and numinous temples, they shall establish the Great Wheel of the Treasure, kindle myriad vessels of divine lamps, and model them after the celestial bodies.

For fifteen days, they shall summon Daoist masters and their assemblies to perform the Dao, pay homage, burn incense, scatter flowers, and establish hundreds and thousands of altars to expound the scriptures of the Three Caverns.

May the nation know peace, weapons of war remain sheathed, illness never arise, calamities and omens lie hidden, misfortunes vanish, stars and constellations follow their proper course, the sun and moon shine brightly, floods, droughts, insects, and frost never appear, men and women flourish in joy, and both the living and the dead receive blessings."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "On the eight solar terms of Heaven, they shall constantly burn incense, perform the Dao, establish great fasts and offerings, recite the true scriptures, expound their wondrous meanings, lecture on the Great Vehicle, kindle lamps, scatter flowers, repent of grave transgressions, inscribe their names on the Yellow Registers and White Tallies of the Eight Heavens, erase their names from the register of death and inscribe them in the record of life, and make offerings to Daoist masters.

May the nation know peace, ruler and ministers share a single purpose, superiors and inferiors remain loyal and virtuous, all grains flourish, the myriad people prosper, men and women rejoice, and all under Heaven enjoy great peace."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "On the fifteenth days of the first, seventh, and tenth months—the Three Origins, when merits and demerits are assessed—they shall, seven days prior, summon Daoist masters to arrange hundreds of dharma seats, expound the scriptures, perform the Dao, pay homage, scatter flowers, burn incense, kindle myriad vessels of lamps, and hold the Great Offering of the Dark Capital. They shall gather all manner of flowers and fruits, fine garments and robes, the seven treasures and rare curios, silks and brocades, musical instruments and regulated implements, foods and fragrant medicines, and all other items available in the world.

Rice, wheat, chariots, banners, flowers, pennants, canopies, bedding, tables, staffs, vases, basins, cushions, and mats of every kind shall be prepared. With sincere hearts, they shall establish the Treasure Tray of the Dark Capital, its size and quantity determined by their devotion. They shall arrange these offerings to present to the Heavenly Worthy, the Worthies and Saints of the Ten Directions, the Dao Mirror of Emptiness and Non-Being, and all the Perfected Immortals. For the secondary offering, they shall present to the manifest numinous powers above and below Heaven, and to those in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the suffering and hidden souls, all men and women, and all sentient beings, that all may partake of blessings and abandon evil causes.

May the nation know peace, all under Heaven rejoice, and both the living and the dead receive blessings."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "On the eight solar terms, jiazi days, one’s birth star days, the Three Origins, and the eight assemblies, they shall constantly make offerings to mountains and waters, present jade rings and pendants, inscribe their names and prayers, erase their sins before the Three Officials, record their names in the Upper Clarity, and petition the heavens.

May the nation know peace, the imperial line endure, lifespans be without limit, all under Heaven flourish in joy, the nation rejoice in great peace, the people live in happiness, and epidemics vanish."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If Heaven and Earth are in disharmony, the sun and moon deviate from their courses, the Five Planets lose their proper paths, the Seven Luminaries shift errantly, the myriad people suffer from epidemics, floods and droughts disrupt the seasons, weapons of war arise on all sides, ghosts wail in the mountains, malevolent omens stir in secret, and myriad disasters and calamities strike, they shall establish hundreds and thousands of altars to expound all the scriptures of the Three Caverns.

They shall perform the Dao, offer thanks, scatter flowers, burn incense, kindle myriad vessels of lamps modeled after the celestial bodies, recite praises, establish fasts and make offerings, widely practice compassionate rescue, greatly establish fields of merit, release living beings and ransom lives, pardon prisoners, absolve capital offenses, relieve the suffering and destitute, bestow alms upon the poor, guide people to build temples, cast images, and copy scriptures. In the eight directions of the nation and the afflicted regions of the land, on the Five Sacred Mountains, they shall create and install images of the Heavenly Worthies and the host of immortals and sages of the Eight Directions, and make offerings to them to protect and secure the land, bestow blessings, and eliminate disasters.

May the land know peace, the stars and constellations follow their proper course, the sun and moon shine purely, the people live in peace, epidemics vanish, all malevolent bandits be eradicated in due time, grains ripen abundantly, men and women rejoice in prosperity, and all under Heaven enjoy great peace."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "I ever abide in great compassion and impartiality, cherishing and mindful of all beings, delivering and liberating them all, that they may depart from all sufferings, attain peace and bliss, enter the gates of manifold wonders, and accomplish the supreme Dao. Yet beings, deluded and ignorant, do not follow my teachings; they turn from the upright and incline toward the perverse, ever committing manifold evils. With deluded thoughts and inverted views, they are bound by afflictions and fall into hells themselves, then say that I am uncompassionate.

Therefore, from kalpa to kalpa, I traverse the ten directions, in heavens and among humans, adapting my manifestations to the age, employing the true, responsive, and transformative Dharma, attending to the needs of the time, skillfully seizing opportunities, harmonizing with the world to save beings, delivering and liberating all. I broadly establish conditions, expound the Dharma, and proclaim the scriptures, universally practicing liberation. My disciples, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, fill the heavens and the human realm, practicing my scriptural teachings, rescuing those in peril and suffering. Throughout the world, with myriad methods and a thousand expedients, my fundamental aim is to guide beings into the Dao.

All you men and women should each be utterly sincere, contemplating the mind through the Dharma, and extracting the Dharma from the mind. Illuminate the mind and comprehend the Dharma, awaken to the Dao and attain perfection. Proceed from the coarse to the wondrous, from the near to the distant, advancing ever further. Wisdom becomes perfectly luminous, ascending into the formless, uniting with emptiness and quiescence, profoundly still and unshaken—only then do you verify the ultimate truth.

Before reaching this state, you must establish great merit. Progressively cultivate within the realm of form, practice with heroic vigor and diligence, endure hardship with utmost sincerity. In every thought, generate the aspiration; I know and perceive all. Every intention you conceive, every field of merit you create—whether in the heavens or the world, the immortals, sages, and divine hosts, the good and evil youths, the vajra deities and divine kings, the officials of the Three Realms and Four Offices, the Five Emperors and their retinues—all record your every thought, noting every detail. The causes and conditions of sin and merit are not lost by even a hair’s breadth. Merit is calculated to offset transgressions; sins are punished and merits rewarded. Accumulated evil destroys the body, while accumulated goodness enhances virtue, like echo following sound, or shadow following form. As a mirror reflects, so too are beauty and ugliness never mistaken.

All you men and women, be ever cautious of this."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "When people practice goodness or commit evil, the heavens observe and the hosts of sages know. Moreover, the lords and kings of nations examine them. Every action and deed elicits a response from Heaven. Good brings auspicious responses; evil brings calamitous ones. Observe the omens to admonish yourselves. When pure and non-active, Heaven and Earth are at peace. When yin and yang are disturbed, when humans and ghosts are troubled, when floods, droughts, epidemics, and blights arise, when grasses and trees flourish or wither—it is the king who evokes these. Thus, as a ruler, one must follow Heaven and transform the people, teaching them the Dao and virtue, loving the people and nurturing all things, curbing desires and minimizing self-interest, being pure and non-active. Then one’s person endures long, and the nation’s destiny is secure."

The Most High Lord of the Dao and the assembly all burned incense, scattered flowers, and circumambulated the Heavenly Worthy, prostrating together. With one voice, they praised the goodness. Heaven and Earth trembled, mountains and seas surged, grasses and trees swayed for a day and a night. Heavenly beings and humans were terrified, not knowing the cause.

Then the Heavenly Worthy emitted five-colored light, illuminating the ten directions like the sun at midday. Above in the heavens and below on Earth, the radiance shone clearly, penetrating all without obstruction. All men and women, whether karmically connected or not, beheld the Heavenly Worthy as if seeing the sun’s image—pure, rare, subtle, and wondrous beyond thought. At that moment, all men and women in the kingdom became luminous in body and form, their afflictions vanished, their wisdom increased, and all attained longevity.

The hosts of sages then bowed their heads and withdrew.
