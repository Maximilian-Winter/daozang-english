# 孙真人备急千金要方

**Preface to Sun Zhenren’s *Essential Emergency Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold***

Of old, the Divine Farmer tasted a hundred herbs to discern the five bitter and six pungent flavors. Then came Yi Yin, and the preparations of decoctions were complete. The Yellow Emperor, wishing to devise the nine needles to treat the illnesses of the three yin and three yang, obtained Qi Bo, and the methods of stone needling and moxibustion were refined. Though the great sages harbored the intent to relieve the people’s suffering, they necessarily awaited ministers of wisdom and broad learning—some to precede them, others to follow—before the sages’ works could endure for all time. The affairs of medicine, having passed through these two sages and two worthies, were thus brought to completion.

Those who later devoted themselves to the arts of healing, if they knew only medicines but not moxibustion, could not fully grasp the essence of treatment; if they knew moxibustion but not acupuncture, they could not exhaust the transformations of the exterior and interior. Only one who could comprehend the profound legacy of these sages and worthies might be deemed a truly excellent physician.

Such a one was the Tang Daoist Master Sun Simiao. Possessed of the highest wisdom and bearing the aspiration to bring peace to his age, during the reign of Taizong, he pondered how to assist his sovereign in sheltering the people. He held that the Dao of the supreme physician was the true governance of the sage and one of the duties of the royal office. Thus, he inherited the teachings of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, elucidated the learning of Qi Bo and Yi Yin, collated Bian Que’s *Classic of Difficult Issues*, adopted Cang Gong’s *Prohibitions*, studied Zhang Zhongjing’s *Yellow and Plain Writings*, Hua Tuo’s *Green Restoration*, Ge Xianweng’s *Infallible Remedies*, Layman Hu’s *Tested Methods*, Zhang Miao’s *Drug Pairings*, Wang Shuhe’s *Pulse Canon*, Huangfu Mi’s *Three Sections*, Tao Hongjing’s *One Hundred and One Remedies*, and beyond these, from Guo Yu and Fan Wang to Sengyuan and Ruan Bing, from the earliest records to the end of the Sui dynasty, whether classics or formulas, none escaped his collection.

Gathering the secret essentials of all schools and discarding what was lacking in the theories of others, he compiled a work in thirty scrolls, with one scroll of contents. It encompassed discourses on the viscera and bowels, methods of acupuncture and moxibustion, differentiation of pulses and symptoms, and the suitability of dietary therapy. Beginning with women, then infants and children, proceeding from beriberi to wind-stroke, febrile diseases, carbuncles and ulcers, wasting-thirst, edema, disorders of the seven orifices, poisoning by the five minerals, emergency remedies, and arts of nurturing life—altogether two hundred thirty-two sections, comprising five thousand three hundred formulas and discussions. None failed to be perfectly efficacious, and all four methods were encompassed. His profound virtue surpassed a thousand gold, and his transmitted methods endured for a hundred generations, ensuring that the excellence of the two sages and two worthies did not fall to the ground. Through him, the people of the world could ascend from the near to the far, and those of superior understanding could fathom the mysteries of the Three Sovereigns—such was the merit of Master Sun’s transmission.

Yet as vulgar tastes favored the strange and perverse, his Dao remained pure and upright, and he did not record bizarre practices like splitting the abdomen or exchanging the heart. As worldly affairs demanded brevity and simplicity, his book was vast and comprehensive, not to be grasped by hearsay or casual talk. Thus, few studied it, and over time it fell into disarray. Worthy successors did not arise, and the bamboo slips decayed and scattered. The uninformed dismissed it as heterodoxy, while those who cherished it abandoned their efforts in the face of doubts.

Our august dynasty, valuing life as virtue and extending love as benevolence, has commanded its scholar-officials to rectify lost learning. We, though our skills are limited, have been entrusted with the task of collation. Thereupon, we sought the imperial archives’ secret texts, explored the *Daoist Canon’s* separate records, and gathered public and private editions far and wide. We corrected errors, supplemented omissions, excised redundancies, and arranged disordered passages. Through months of effort, we organized and classified the material.

Though an overarching structure was established, some passages remained obscure. Therefore, we began by rectifying the root to order the branches, consulting works such as the *Plain Questions*, *Nine Regions*, *Spiritual Pivot*, *A-B Canon*, *Grand Simplicity*, *Origins of Diseases*, various materia medica, ancient pulse texts, *Golden Casket and Jade Case*, *Handbook of Emergency Remedies*, Xie Shiqin’s *Condensed Formulas*, Liu Juanzi’s *Ghost-Bequeathed Treatise*, and the like. Every source was meticulously examined. Where gaps remained, we traced the streams back to their sources, consulting works such as the *Five Mirrors Classic*, *Supplement to the Thousand Gold*, Cui’s *Essentials*, *Secret Records for Extending Life*, *Broad Benefits of the Zhengyuan Era*, *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*, *Military Ministry’s Handbook*, and *Dream’s Verified Transmissions*. All distinctions were scrutinized, and every principle was investigated. Through mutual verification and repeated comparison, the obscure passages and doubtful meanings were at last clarified.

Though the book is old, its use is ever new. It can succor living beings and aid the sagely governance that cherishes life; it can be transmitted immortally, fulfilling the sovereign’s aspiration to extend boundless love. Not merely an ornament of a peaceful age, it truly assists the imperial bestowal of blessings.

Now that the collation is complete and the transcription begun, we respectfully present it for Your Majesty’s perusal.

Respectfully submitted by:
Minister Gao Baoheng, Right Advisor to the Crown Prince;
Minister Sun Qi, Attendant Gentleman of the Ministry of Justice;
Minister Lin Yi, Collator of the Secret Pavilion and Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites;
Minister Qian Xiangxian, Vice Minister of Works and Concurrent Lecturer to the Emperor.

**Original Preface**

When the clear and turbid were first separated and the above and below were distinguished, the Three Powers took form, and the Five Phases descended in order. All things were in pristine simplicity, beyond any designation.

When the Firesage emerged, he observed the Dipper and Pole to determine the cardinal directions and names, first bringing forth the transformations of fire. Fu Xi arose, and following this, drew the Eight Trigrams and established the kitchen. As flavors flourished, the art of healing began to sprout. The Great Sage Divine Farmer, moved by the multitude of ailments among the common people, tasted the hundred herbs to save and cure them—yet this was still not entirely perfected. When the Yellow Emperor received the Mandate, he devised the nine needles and, with the alchemist Qi Bo, Thunder Duke, and their peers, exhaustively discussed the channels and vessels. Through extensive inquiry and debate, they thoroughly explored the principles and established them as canonical treatises, so that later generations might rely upon and expound them.

During the Spring and Autumn period, the skilled physicians He and Huan flourished; in the time of the Six States, Bian Que appeared. The Han saw Zhang Zhongjing and Cang Gong, while the Wei had Hua Tuo—all of whom traced hidden patterns, plumbed the profound and subtle, using no more than two or three medicinals, and no more than seven or eight moxa cones, yet left no illness uncured. From the Jin and Song dynasties onward, though renowned physicians continued to emerge, they could cure no more than five or six out of ten cases. This is largely because people of today indulge their desires excessively, lack constancy of mind, and abandon themselves to dissipation, failing in the art of nurturing life.

I have long pondered the sagely teachings, which sought to enable every household to study and every person to understand: if one’s lord or parents fall ill and cannot be healed, this is no true loyalty or filial piety. Yet petty men of this degenerate age, practicing deceit and cunning, lean upon sagely teachings to perpetrate fraud. Thus, both court and common folk alike disdain the name of medicine and healing. They teach their sons and younger brothers to recite short texts and compose minor essays in pursuit of official advancement, while the art of healing is neglected and left undiscussed—how strange indeed!

Alas! This deeply betrays the original intent of the sages and worthies.

In my youth, I suffered from wind and chills, repeatedly seeking the doors of physicians, until the costs of decoctions and medicines exhausted my family’s wealth. Thus, from my green-tied years, I esteemed this canon; even in my hoary-headed age, I have never set aside its scrolls. As for pulse-taking and diagnosis, gathering herbs and compounding remedies, regulating ingestion and convalescence, and all matters of caution and care—wherever I found one thing in which another excelled, I would journey a thousand *li* to bow in reverence and seek resolution. By the time I reached my twentieth year, I began to perceive some understanding. Thereafter, among my kin and neighbors, near and far, those afflicted with illness or distress often found relief through my aid. As for my own ailments, I severed all reliance on physicians’ doors—thus I knew that formulas, remedies, and materia medica could not be left unstudied.

Yet I observed that the vast array of medical formulas was boundless and vast; when sudden illness struck, searching for the right prescription proved exceedingly difficult. By the time the formula was found, the disease had already become untreatable. Alas! Grieved by the unseen suffering of premature deaths, and lamenting the benighted folly of abandoned learning, I broadly gathered the many classics, pruning their redundancies, and striving for simplicity and ease, to compose the *Essential Formulas for Emergencies [Worth] a Thousand in Gold*, in over thirty scrolls. Though it cannot exhaustively probe the origins of all diseases, those who devote attention to it may yet grasp more than half.

I hold that human life is of utmost weight, more precious than a thousand in gold; a single formula that saves a life attains virtue surpassing this, and thus I have given it this name. It is not yet fit for transmission among the scholar-official class, but may perhaps be bequeathed to my own household.

Zhang Zhongjing said: “The scholars of this present age scarcely turn their minds to medicine and remedies, nor do they delve deeply into formulas and therapies. Above, they fail to heal the illnesses of their lords and parents; below, they fail to rescue the poor and humble from distress; and in their own persons, they fail to preserve their health and prolong their lives. Instead, they vie for glory and power, straining to stand among the mighty, ceaselessly striving, ever fixated on fame and profit. They adorn the branches while neglecting the root, seeking to embellish their outward appearance while withering within.”

When the skin no longer exists, where shall the hair adhere? Advancing, they cannot cherish others or understand things; retreating, they cannot cherish themselves or know their own nature. Suddenly encountering the qi of wind and pathogenic influences, they contract extraordinary illnesses. Once calamity and misfortune arrive, only then do they tremble in fear—standing upon the brink of death, muddled and confused, drifting like lost souls. They humble their aspirations and lower their pride, reverently gazing upon shamans and priests, confessing their helplessness and resigning to fate, submitting passively to defeat. Entrusting a lifespan of a hundred years and the most precious of vessels—the body—to mediocre physicians, they allow them free rein. Alas! Too late for regret! Lamenting as the body perishes, the spirit vanishes, transformed into something other, buried in the depths of the Yellow Springs, leaving only sorrow. How grievous! The whole world remains deluded, none awakening to the truth, abandoning themselves thus—what glory or power is there to speak of? This is what is meant.

**On the Study of Medicine**

**I. On the Great Physician’s Learning**

Those who aspire to become great physicians must be thoroughly versed in the *Plain Questions*, *A-B Classic*, *Yellow Emperor’s Needle Classic*, *Bright Hall Flowing Circulation*, the twelve meridians, the three regions and nine indicators, the five viscera and six bowels, exterior and interior points, the *Materia Medica*, and *Drug Pairings*, as well as the classical formulas of Zhang Zhongjing, Wang Shuhe, Ruan Henan, Fan Dongyang, Zhang Miao, Zhan Shao, and others.

They must also master the subtleties of yin-yang, fate and fortune, the physiognomic arts of various schools, divination by scorched tortoise shells and the five omens, and the *Book of Changes* and Six Ren methods—all must be studied with precision. Only then may one be called a great physician. Without such learning, one is like a blind man wandering at night, stumbling and falling at every step.

Next, one must study these formulas diligently, pondering their profound principles and devoting oneself to their exploration. Only then may one speak of the Dao of medicine.

Furthermore, one must peruse a wide range of books. Why? Without reading the Five Classics, one cannot know the Way of benevolence and righteousness. Without reading the Three Histories, one cannot understand the affairs of past and present. Without reading the various philosophers, one cannot silently comprehend matters as they arise. Without reading the *Inner Classic*, one cannot grasp the virtue of compassion, joy, and renunciation. Without reading the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*, one cannot embody spontaneity and natural movement—otherwise, good and ill fortune will be bound by taboos, arising at every turn.

As for the waxing and waning of the five phases and the celestial patterns of the seven luminaries, one must delve deeply into their mysteries. If one can study all these comprehensively, then in the Dao of medicine, nothing will obstruct or hinder, and one may achieve perfection.

**II. On the Great Physician’s Sincerity and Dedication**

Zhang Zhan said: The difficulty of mastering classical formulas has long been acknowledged. Now, diseases may appear similar externally yet differ internally, or differ internally yet appear similar externally. Thus, the fullness or emptiness of the five viscera and six bowels, the patency or blockage of the blood vessels and defensive qi, cannot be discerned by the eyes and ears alone—one must first examine and assess them through diagnosis.

Yet the pulses at the inch, bar, and cubit positions may be confused by floating, sinking, wiry, or tight qualities; the flow of qi through the transport points may vary in height, depth, shallowness, or profundity; the skin, flesh, sinews, and bones may differ in thickness, thinness, hardness, or softness. Only those who apply their minds with utmost precision may speak of these matters.

Now, to seek the most refined and subtle principles through the coarsest and shallowest thoughts—how perilous! If one supplements what is already full, depletes what is already empty, drains what is already unobstructed, or obstructs what is already blocked, cools what is already cold, or warms what is already hot, one only aggravates the illness and hopes for recovery—I foresee only death.

Thus, medicine, divination, and the arts are among the most difficult to master. Since they are not divinely bestowed, how can one grasp their hidden subtleties?

There are fools in the world who, after reading formulas for three years, claim there is no disease they cannot cure. Yet after treating diseases for three years, they realize there is no formula they can rely upon. Therefore, students must exhaustively explore the origins of medicine, diligently and tirelessly, without merely heeding hearsay and claiming to have mastered the Dao of medicine—how deeply they deceive themselves!

When a great physician treats illness, he must first calm his spirit and settle his mind, free from desires and demands. He must first arouse a heart of great compassion and empathy, vowing to universally relieve the suffering of all living beings.

When those afflicted by illness or misfortune come seeking help, he must not inquire into their status—whether noble or base, rich or poor, old or young, beautiful or ugly, friend or foe, Chinese or foreign, foolish or wise. He must regard them all equally, as if they were his closest kin.

He must not look ahead or behind, worrying about his own fortune or misfortune, or cherishing his own life. Seeing their suffering, he must feel as if it were his own, his heart filled with sorrow and distress. He must not avoid perilous paths, day or night, cold or heat, hunger or thirst, fatigue or exhaustion, but devote himself wholeheartedly to their rescue, without any thought of making a show of his efforts.

Only thus may one be called a great physician for the people. To act otherwise is to be a great bandit to all living beings.

Since ancient times, renowned physicians have often used living creatures to save those in critical condition. Though one may say that human life is more valuable than that of animals, when it comes to cherishing life, humans and animals are the same. To harm one to benefit another is a grievance shared by all beings—how much more so for humans!

To take life in pursuit of saving life only distances one further from life. This is why my formulas do not use living creatures as medicine. As for creatures like horseflies and leeches, if they are already dead when purchased from the market, they may be used—this is not the same.

Even something like a chicken egg, though it is in a state of undifferentiated chaos, must only be used in cases of great urgency and necessity, and even then with reluctance. Those who can avoid using it altogether are truly wise, though this may not always be possible.

When encountering patients with festering sores, dysentery, or foul and repulsive conditions that others find unbearable to look upon, one must only arouse feelings of shame, pity, and deep concern, without the slightest trace of aversion or disgust—this is my aspiration.

The demeanor of a great physician should be one of serene concentration and inward reflection, appearing solemn and dignified. His bearing should be expansive and magnanimous, neither ostentatious nor obscure.

When examining and diagnosing illness, he must apply his mind with utmost care and depth, scrutinizing the patient’s condition with meticulous attention, not missing even the slightest detail. When prescribing acupuncture or medicine, he must do so without the slightest error.

Though illness demands swift treatment, one must remain unconfused in the moment. One must carefully deliberate and ponder deeply, never rashly displaying cleverness or seeking fame at the expense of a patient’s life—this would be most unbenevolent.

When visiting a patient’s home, even if fine silks and brocades fill the eyes, one must not glance left or right. Though music may fill the ears, one must not appear to take pleasure in it. Though delicacies may be served, one must eat as if they had no taste. Though fine wines may be offered, one must regard them as if they were not there.

Thus it is that when one person grieves in a corner, the entire hall cannot rejoice—how much more so when a patient endures suffering without respite, while the physician remains at ease, indulging in merriment or complacency? Such conduct is a shared disgrace before both humanity and the divine, and the perfected would never act thus. This is the foundational intent of medicine.

The principles of being a physician forbid excessive speech, jesting, boisterous laughter, gossiping about right and wrong, judging others, flaunting one’s reputation, slandering fellow physicians, or boasting of one’s own virtue. Should one happen to cure a single ailment, one must not raise one’s head with an air of self-satisfaction, proclaiming oneself peerless in the world—this is the fatal flaw of the medical profession.

Lao Jun said: "One who performs yang virtue is repaid by others; one who performs yin virtue is repaid by spirits and gods. One who commits yang evil is repaid by others; one who commits yin evil is harmed by spirits and gods." Examining these two paths—yin and yang retribution—how could this be false?

Therefore, a physician must not rely on personal skill to scheme for wealth, but should act with a heart of relieving suffering. In the unseen workings of the Dao, such conduct naturally attracts abundant blessings. Nor should one, upon seeing a patient’s wealth and status, prescribe rare and costly medicines to make them difficult to obtain, merely to display one’s own abilities—this is hardly the way of loyalty and forbearance.

With the intent to save and aid, I have discussed these matters in such detail, though the words may seem coarse. Let the learner not disdain their plainness.

**On the General Principles of Treating Illness, Section Three**

Heaven spreads the five phases to nurture the ten thousand things; humans receive the five constants to form the five viscera. Through the channels, network vessels, and visceral conduits, yin and yang intermingle, their mysterious and subtle transformations boundless. As the *Yi* states: "Without the utmost profundity of the world, who could engage with this?"

Yet today’s physicians do not seek to study the classics’ essentials to expand their knowledge. Each relies on familial techniques, adhering rigidly to tradition. When examining and inquiring about illness, they focus on glib speech, facing the patient for but a moment before prescribing decoctions. They press the inch pulse but neglect the foot; they grasp the hand but ignore the foot vessels. The three positions—Renying, Fuyang, and the three divisions—are not cross-referenced. Breaths and beats do not reach fifty; short-term prognoses remain undetermined. The nine indicators are barely glimpsed, and the features of the Ming Tang and Que Ting are entirely unobserved. This is nothing more than "peering through a tube." How then can one distinguish life from death? This is the deepest caution for physicians. Patients must carefully examine such matters and guard against them.

Since ancient times, physicians have harbored mutual jealousy. Bian Que was murdered by Li Xi, the imperial physician of Qin—such is the evidence. When one physician prescribes a formula, another must not be allowed to compound it. If poison is secretly added, the patient’s condition may worsen, gradually leading to debilitation. Such cases are not rare; one must be especially vigilant. Better to forgo the medicine and rely on natural vitality than to let foolish physicians, consumed by envy, endanger a life—how lamentable this is.

The roots of the hundred diseases include wind-stroke, cold damage, alternating chills and fever, warm malaria, sudden affliction, cholera, abdominal distension, water swelling, intestinal obstruction, dysentery, urinary and fecal blockage, running piglet qi, counterflow qi, coughing, retching, vomiting, jaundice, wasting-thirst, retained fluids, food stagnation, hard accumulations, concretions and conglomerations, fright-induced epilepsy, ghost possession, throat impediment, toothache, deafness, blindness, metal wounds, fractures, abscesses, malignant sores, hemorrhoids, fistulas, tumors, and goiters. In men, the five taxations, seven injuries, deficiency, emaciation, and weakness; in women, vaginal discharge, flooding and spotting, blood block, and yin erosion. Injuries from insects, snakes, and gu poison—these are the general categories. Their variations and branches must be traced to their origins for treatment.

Additionally, there are cold, heat, taxation damage, overeating, sexual exhaustion, fright, palpitations, fear, sorrow, and anxiety. There are also childbirth, lactation, miscarriage, and stagnant blood from falls. Some seek pleasure in the bedchamber through the reckless consumption of the five minerals. These are the root sources of illness, from which countless branches and leaves of suffering arise. One cannot be ignorant of their beginnings and ends.

However, when a physician speaks of a patient’s condition—whether male or female, young or old—if half of it aligns with the disease’s origin, medicine may be administered.

Men, as the convergence of all yang, typically dwell in dryness. Their yang qi moves freely, and through strenuous exertion and ejaculation, they readily develop taxation and depletion disorders—such cases are numerous. Compared to women, their illnesses are ten times easier to treat.

Generally, once a girl reaches fourteen, she begins menstruation. If she encounters wind, cold, dampness, or heat during her menses, or if the four seasons’ illnesses coincide with it, she should disclose this. Otherwise, treatment may inadvertently clash with her condition, worsening her state. The prescriber should also inquire about this.

All medicines should be chosen according to the land’s suitability. In Jiangnan and the regions south of the Five Ridges, the climate is hot and humid, and the people have thin, delicate skin with loose interstices—medicines should be mild and minimal. In Guanzhong and Hebei, the land is hard and dry, and the people have tough skin with tight interstices—medicines should be stronger and more substantial.

Some in the prime of life, heedless of wind and dampness, violate prohibitions, and recklessly deplete their essence. Even with minor illnesses, they must not be lightly purged with potent medicines. A single excessive purge can exhaust their essence, leaving them bedridden for months or years.

For chronic illnesses, purgative decoctions may be used, but the full dose need not be taken. Once the purging is sufficient, stop. If the disease’s root remains, the formula may be repeated later. If the patient has some strength to endure the full dose, this need not be considered.

When the disease’s root requires purgative decoctions for removal, after purging, pills and powders should be administered periodically to assist. If a patient recovers after taking a purgative decoction, they must thereafter avoid tonic decoctions. If tonics are taken, the disease may return. Further purging would then inflict additional harm.

If the patient has just recovered but their qi and strength have not fully returned to balance, simply observe their condition carefully. Should medication be necessary, use mild remedies to harmonize them. For those with chronic ailments who are still able to walk and whose strength has not declined, if they wish to take restorative tonics—whether warming or cooling pills and powders—it is first proper to administer purgative decoctions to eliminate accumulations of phlegm and stagnation in the chest and abdomen. Only afterward may tonics be taken.

For those suffering from extreme depletion and taxation requiring restorative decoctions, no more than three doses should be given before stopping. If treating wind disorders with wind-dispelling decoctions, however, three or five doses are not sufficient to gauge their effect. Some cases involve persistent wind and profound deficiency, requiring ten or more doses, even extending to a hundred days or more before recovery is achieved. Thus it is said: for excess, purge; for deficiency, tonify.

Within the two modes of yin and yang, among all things, humans are most noble. Humans receive the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, and all laws, rituals, and music originate from them. At the beginning of life, essence is formed first, and once essence is complete, the brain and marrow come into being. The head is round, modeling Heaven; the feet are square, resembling Earth. The eyes correspond to the sun and moon; the five viscera align with the five stars; the six bowels follow the six pitch-pipes; and the heart serves as the central axis. The large intestine is twelve feet long, corresponding to the twelve hours; the small intestine is twenty-four feet long, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. The body has three hundred sixty-five collaterals, matching the days of the year. Humans possess nine orifices, corresponding to the nine provinces. Heaven has cold and heat; humans have deficiency and excess. Heaven has punishment and virtue; humans have love and aversion. Heaven has yin and yang; humans have male and female. The moon waxes and wanes; humans vary in height.

Thus, when the consumption of the five grains lacks moderation, cold and heat, saltiness and bitterness clash and collide, jointly assaulting the body to transform into illness. Generally, the art of medical diagnosis and examination is by no means easy. Yet one who, through inquiry, discerns the depth of an ailment is called a skillful physician.

Master Zhongjing said: Whenever preparing decoctions or compounding medicines, or applying the methods of acupuncture and moxibustion, one must reflect with utmost care. It is essential to thoroughly understand the twelve meridians, distinguish the three hundred sixty acupoints, and comprehend the circulation of *ying* and *wei* qi to identify the location of the disease and the appropriate method of treatment—this knowledge cannot be lacking.

In ancient times, superior physicians examined complexion: the color of the complexion and the pulse must not diverge from the physical form. If black overrides red, death follows; if red overrides green, life remains. Mediocre physicians listened to the voice: when the voice harmonized with the five notes, fire hearing the sound of water caused vexation and fright; wood hearing the sound of metal induced fear and mutual punishment.

The spleen corresponds to earth, nurturing the myriad things and aiding the four directions. When it is well, its presence is unseen; when it fails, all return to it. If it is in excess, the four limbs cannot be lifted; if it is deficient, the nine orifices become obstructed. The six senses grow blocked, leaving one as if intoxicated. The four seasons revolve, ending only to begin anew.

Inferior physicians diagnose by pulse, discerning the origin of disease, its flow and movement, the reversal or compliance of the four seasons, and the mutual harm or generation among the five phases. By carefully examining the subtleties of the viscera and bowels, they achieve mastery.

**On Diagnosis and Examination, Chapter Four**
To treat illness, one must first investigate its source and observe the mechanism of the disease. If the five viscera are not yet depleted, the six bowels not yet exhausted, the blood and vessels not yet disordered, and the spirit not yet scattered, then with medicinal treatment, life is surely preserved. If the disease has already taken form, only half may be cured. Once the momentum of the illness has passed, life becomes difficult to save.

The method of diagnosis is customarily performed at dawn, when *yin* qi has not yet stirred, *yang* qi has not yet dispersed, food has not been consumed, the meridians are not yet full, the network vessels are balanced, and the *qi* and blood are undisturbed. Only then may one take the pulse to discern its compliance or reversal. This is not to be done at other times—one must carefully examine the three positions and nine indicators before clearly declaring the condition.

The ancients skilled in medicine were thus: superior physicians healed the state, mediocre physicians healed people, and inferior physicians healed diseases. It is also said: superior physicians listen to the voice, mediocre physicians observe the complexion, and inferior physicians diagnose by pulse. Further, it is said: superior physicians treat the disease that has not yet arisen, mediocre physicians treat the disease that is about to arise, and inferior physicians treat the disease that has already arisen. If one does not apply the mind with care and intention, matters become confused, and the patient becomes difficult to save.

What are the three positions? They are the *cun*, *guan*, and *chi*. The upper position corresponds to heaven and the lungs; the middle position corresponds to humanity and the spleen; the lower position corresponds to earth and the kidneys.

What are the nine indicators? Each position has three, making nine in total. In the upper position (heaven): the arteries at the two temples govern the *qi* of the head and corners; in the upper position (earth): the arteries at the two cheeks govern the *qi* of the mouth and teeth; in the upper position (humanity): the arteries before the ears govern the *qi* of the ears and eyes. In the middle position (heaven): the hand *Taiyin* governs the *qi* of the lungs; in the middle position (earth): the hand *Yangming* governs the *qi* of the chest; in the middle position (humanity): the hand *Shaoyin* governs the *qi* of the heart. In the lower position (heaven): the foot *Jueyin* governs the *qi* of the liver; in the lower position (earth): the foot *Shaoyin* governs the *qi* of the kidneys; in the lower position (humanity): the foot *Taiyin* governs the *qi* of the spleen. Together, these form the nine indicators.

When the body is robust but the pulse is faint, and one is short of breath and unable to breathe, death follows. When the body is emaciated but the pulse is large, and the chest is full of *qi*, death follows. When form and *qi* are in harmony, life remains. When the three (positions) and five (phases) are disharmonious, illness arises. When the three positions and nine indicators all diverge, death follows.

Foolish physicians, ignorant of the three positions and nine indicators, as well as the meridians of the four seasons, may mistakenly administer decoctions or misapply acupuncture and moxibustion. Though they follow prescriptions to treat illness, they instead exacerbate other ailments, leading to ruin. Alas for the suffering people—half die wrongfully. How lamentable that the world lacks good physicians to explain these principles.

The classics state: Earth, water, fire, and wind combine to form a person. When the *qi* of fire is unregulated, the entire body steams with heat. When the *qi* of wind is unregulated, the whole body stiffens, and all the pores become blocked. When the *qi* of water is unregulated, the body swells, the *qi* becomes full, and breathing grows coarse. When the *qi* of earth is unregulated, the four limbs cannot be lifted, and speech loses its sound. When fire departs, the body grows cold; when wind ceases, the *qi* is cut off; when water is exhausted, there is no blood; when earth scatters, the body splits apart.

Yet foolish physicians, failing to consider the pathways of the pulse, treat the disease in reverse, causing the five phases within the viscera to mutually overcome one another. It is like adding oil to a raging fire—one cannot be too cautious. When the four *qi* harmonize in virtue and the four spirits are at peace, is there not tranquility? If even one *qi* is unregulated, one hundred and one diseases arise. When the four spirits stir, four hundred and four diseases erupt simultaneously.

It is also said: One hundred and one diseases heal on their own; one hundred and one diseases require treatment to heal; one hundred and one diseases are difficult to heal even with treatment; and one hundred and one diseases are truly incurable and fatal.

Master Zhang Zhongjing said: To treat various diseases, one should first use decoctions to purge the five viscera and six bowels, open the meridians, regulate *yin* and *yang*, disperse pathogenic *qi*, moisten what is withered, enliven the skin, and replenish the *qi* and blood. Water can cleanse all things, hence the use of decoctions. If the limbs have been afflicted for a long time and wind-cold stirs, next one should use powders, for powders can expel pathogenic *qi*. When wind, dampness, and impediment move between the exterior and interior without fixed location, powders are used to balance them. Next, one should use pills, for pills can dispel wind-cold, break up accumulations, dissolve hard masses, promote appetite, and harmonize *ying* and *wei*. One who can skillfully combine and apply these methods may be called a superior physician.

Thus it is said: Medicine is intention. It is also said: To force sweating when it is not needed depletes the fluids, leading to desiccation and death. To withhold sweating when it is needed causes the pores to close, leading to suffocation and death.

Moreover, to force purgation when it is not needed opens the intestines, causing uncontrollable diarrhea and death; to withhold purgation when it is needed causes internal vexation, distension, fullness, and restlessness, leading to swelling and death. To force moxibustion when it is not needed allows fire-pathogens to enter the abdomen, scorching and disrupting the five viscera, compounding vexation and leading to death; to withhold moxibustion when it is needed causes cold congealment to thicken, growing ever more stubborn, with *qi* surging upward to the heart, leaving no place for dissipation, and the illness becomes critical, leading to death.

The Yellow Emperor asked: What of excessive and wandering pathogenic *qi*?
Qibo replied: When proper pathogenic *qi* invades from without, it has no fixed abode, and when it overflows into the viscera, it finds no settled place. It moves together with *ying* and *wei*, and with the *hun* and *po* in flight, causing one to lie restless and dream excessively. When *qi* overflows into the bowels, it becomes excessive externally and insufficient internally; when *qi* overflows into the viscera, it becomes excessive internally and insufficient externally.

The Emperor asked: Do excess and insufficiency have physical manifestations?
Qibo replied: When *yin* is exuberant, one dreams of wading through great waters in fear; when *yang* is exuberant, one dreams of treading in great fires and being scorched. When both *yin* and *yang* are exuberant, one dreams of mutual killing and destruction. When the upper is exuberant, one dreams of flying; when the lower is exuberant, one dreams of falling. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of receiving. When liver *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of anger; when lung *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of fear, weeping, and wailing; when heart *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of joy, laughter, and terror; when spleen *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of singing, music, heaviness, and inability to lift the hands and feet; when kidney *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of the waist and spine separating and disconnecting. For these eleven cases of exuberance, promptly draining them brings immediate resolution.

When perverse *qi* lodges in the heart, one dreams of hills and mountains with smoke and fire; when it lodges in the lungs, one dreams of flying and seeing strange objects of metal and iron; when it lodges in the liver, one dreams of mountains, forests, and trees; when it lodges in the spleen, one dreams of hills, marshes, collapsing houses, and wind and rain; when it lodges in the kidneys, one dreams of standing at the edge of an abyss or being submerged in water; when it lodges in the bladder, one dreams of wandering; when it lodges in the stomach, one dreams of eating and drinking; when it lodges in the large intestine, one dreams of fields and wilds; when it lodges in the small intestine, one dreams of crowded towns and streets; when it lodges in the gallbladder, one dreams of fighting, litigation, and self-mutilation; when it lodges in the genitals, one dreams of intercourse and internal struggle; when it lodges in the nape, one dreams of decapitation; when it lodges in the hips, one dreams of walking without progress, or dwelling in ponds, ditches, wells, or pits; when it lodges in the thighs, one dreams of rituals, bowing, and kneeling; when it lodges in the bladder and rectum, one dreams of drowning or relieving oneself. For these fifteen cases of insufficiency, promptly supplementing them brings immediate resolution. The skilled diagnostician may deeply ponder this principle to achieve perfection.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: There are six conditions that render illness untreatable. First, arrogance and self-indulgence without regard for reason; second, valuing wealth over one’s own body; third, inability to properly regulate clothing and diet; fourth, *yin* and *yang* both in disorder with unsettled visceral *qi*; fifth, extreme emaciation preventing the taking of medicine; sixth, belief in shamans and not in physicians. While the signs of life remain, the complexion has not yet changed, and the illness has not yet penetrated the interstices, timely acupuncture and medicine, proper regulation, and entrusting oneself to a good physician ensure that no illness will not be cured.

**On Prescribing Formulas, Fifth Section**
To treat cold with hot medicines, to treat heat with cold medicines, to treat undigested food with emetic and purgative medicines, to treat *gu* toxins and demonic infestations with *gu* toxin medicines, to treat abscesses, swellings, sores, and tumors with medicines for sores and tumors, to treat wind-dampness with wind-dampness medicines—each is applied according to what is appropriate.

Leigong said: Medicines have three grades, and illnesses have three stages. Medicines vary in sweetness and bitterness, lightness and heaviness. Illnesses differ in being recent or long-standing, cold or warm. Heavy, hot, greasy, slippery, salty, intoxicating medicines, minerals, and foods are suitable for wind illnesses, but not for others. Light, cold, coarse, astringent, sweet, and bitter medicines, herbs, and foods are suitable for heat illnesses, but not for others. Light, hot, acrid, bitter, bland medicines and foods are suitable for cold illnesses, but not for others. These are the general principles, briefly revealing their origins. The rest may be discerned by observing the condition, and one should act appropriately according to the circumstances, keeping these essentials in mind.

The *Materia Medica Pairings* states: All accumulations and gatherings of illnesses arise from deficiency, and deficiency gives rise to the hundred illnesses. Accumulations are what the five viscera accumulate; gatherings are what the six bowels gather. For such illnesses, most follow established formulas without need for modification. For those deficient and taxed, the manifestations are myriad, and one should adjust according to the illness.

The good physicians of old all gathered their own medicines, examining their natures and what they governed, and selecting the proper time and season, early or late. If too early, the medicinal potency is not yet formed; if too late, the peak potency has already waned. Today’s physicians do not gather their own medicines, nor do they consider the timing of the seasons, merely collecting them together to use as medicine. Moreover, they do not understand the dynamics of cold and heat or the proper dosages, merely harboring the intention to treat illness without achieving certain cure—this is truly delusory. I have briefly examined their cold and heat properties and recorded their principal modifications.

For deficiency taxation with headache and recurrent heat, add *gouqi* and *wei rui*; for deficiency with vomiting, add ginseng; for deficiency with restlessness, also add ginseng; for deficiency with many confused dreams, add *longgu*; for deficiency with much heat, add *dihuang*, *muli*, *difuzi*, and licorice; for deficiency with cold, add *danggui*, *xiongqiong*, and dried ginger; for deficiency with depletion, add stalactite, *jici*, *roucongrong*, and *bajitian*.

For deficiency with high fever, add *huangqin* and *tianmendong*; for deficiency with forgetfulness, add *fushen* and *yuanzhi*; for deficiency with fright palpitations and restlessness, add *longchi*, *zishiying*, *shashen*, and *xiaocao*—if cold predominates, use *zishiying* and *xiaocao*; if external heat is present, use *shashen* and *longchi*; if neither cold nor heat is evident, omit them. For deficiency with dry mouth, add *maimendong* and *zhimu*; for deficiency with shortness of breath, add *huma*, *fupenzi*, and *baiziren*; for deficiency with excessive qi and slight cough, add *wuweizi* and *dazao*; for deficiency with bodily stiffness and lumbar discomfort, add *cishi* and *duzhong*; for deficiency with pronounced cold, add *guixin*, *wuzhuyu*, *fuzi*, and *wutou*; for deficiency with dark urine, add *huangqin*; for deficiency with external heat, add *digupi* and *baishuihuangqi*; for deficiency with cold, use *longxihuangqi*; for deficiency with phlegm and qi stagnation, add fresh ginger, *banxia*, and *zhishi*; for deficiency with frequent urination, add *sangpiaoxiao*, *longgu*, and *jijitun*; for deficiency with urinary difficulty, add *fuling* and *zexie*; for deficiency with white dysentery, add *houpo*.

None of these medicinals should be used exhaustively one by one; rather, one must assess the patient’s constitution and the dynamics of cold and heat, selecting those that directly address the condition. This brief account touches only on modifications at the margins—those who compose prescriptions should take this as their standard.

**On the Use of Medicinals, Sixth Section**
The 120 superior medicinals serve as sovereigns, governing the nourishment of life in accord with Heaven. They are non-toxic, and even prolonged or frequent use does no harm. Those who seek to lighten the body, augment qi, prevent aging, and prolong life should base their practice on the *Upper Canon*.

The 120 middle medicinals serve as ministers, governing the cultivation of nature in accord with humanity. Whether toxic or non-toxic, their use must be carefully weighed. Those who seek to suppress illness and replenish deficiency should base their practice on the *Middle Canon*.

The 125 inferior medicinals serve as assistants and envoys, governing the treatment of illness in accord with Earth. They are often toxic and should not be taken for long. Those who seek to dispel cold and heat pathogenic qi, break up accumulations, and cure disease should base their practice on the *Lower Canon*.

The three ranks together comprise 365 medicinals, corresponding to the 365 degrees of the celestial cycle, each degree aligning with a single day to complete a year. Doubling this number yields 730 names.

In all medicinals, there are sovereigns, ministers, assistants, and envoys, which interact through mutual enhancement and regulation when combined. A proper formula may consist of one sovereign, two ministers, three assistants, and five envoys—or alternatively, one sovereign, three ministers, and nine assistants and envoys.

Further, there are yin-yang pairings, mother-child and sibling relationships, roots and stems, flowers and fruits, herbs and stones, bones and flesh. Some act alone, while others require mutual reinforcement, mutual assistance, mutual restraint, mutual aversion, mutual opposition, or mutual detoxification. These seven interactions must be carefully considered when combining medicinals. Those that reinforce or assist each other are optimal; those that are mutually averse or opposed should not be used together. If toxicity must be moderated, one may employ those that restrain or detoxify each other—otherwise, they should not be combined.

Additionally, there are the five flavors—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and acrid—and the four qi—cold, hot, warm, and cool—as well as distinctions between toxic and non-toxic, yin-dried and sun-dried, the timing of harvesting, raw and prepared states, the land of origin, and whether the medicinal is genuine or counterfeit, aged or fresh. Each of these follows its own principles.

The seven interactions of mutual assistance and mutual restraint are listed below. When composing prescriptions, one must study them deeply.

Some ask: "The ancients used few drugs in small doses, yet cured many illnesses. Your prescriptions are complex and heavy in dosage, yet your cure rates do not match the ancients—why?"

I answer: "In ancient times, the days were long, and medicinal herbs grew naturally in the earth for extended periods, their *qi* and flavor pure and potent. People were less desirous, their *qi* harmonious, and their illnesses mild, making them easy to treat. Now, time is fleeting, medicinal potency weak and insubstantial. People are cunning and deceitful, their illnesses severe and difficult to cure. Mild illnesses require few drugs; severe ones demand more. This is but one aspect of medicine—what is strange about it?

Moreover, ancient physicians gathered and prepared their own medicines, drying them in shade or sun according to proper methods. They used herbs from their native lands, thus achieving nine cures out of ten. Today’s physicians merely diagnose pulses and write prescriptions, ignorant of the proper seasons for harvesting, the origins of herbs, or their freshness and potency. Thus, they succeed in only five or six out of ten cases—this is the true reason.

When prescribing, one must exercise great care and use repeated doses to ensure efficacy. To imitate the ancients blindly is to court failure. Future scholars must study these principles thoroughly.

All minerals such as *fluorite*, *quartz*, *cinnabar*, *realgar*, and *sulfur* must be lustrous, translucent, and vividly colored to be of high quality. Otherwise, they will cause bodily dryness, fever, thirst, and even death.

All herbal and mineral medicines must come from firm, rich soil, their *qi* and flavor strong and pungent; otherwise, they will not cure illness.

*Wolfsbane*, *unripe bitter orange*, *tangerine peel*, *pinellia*, *ephedra*, and *evodia* are best when aged; the rest should be fresh and refined."

**On Compounding (Section Seven)**

Question: "When compounding decoctions and medicines from herbs, minerals, insects, and animals, how should the water measurements, processing, and reduction methods be determined?"

Answer: "Herbs have roots, stems, branches, leaves, bark, wood, flowers, and fruits; insects and animals have fur, wings, skin, shells, heads, feet, tails, and bones. Some require roasting, refining, or steaming—each has its proper method, as detailed below. Following the method brings fortune; defying it invites misfortune.

Some require removing the skin and keeping the flesh; others, discarding the flesh and retaining the skin. Some need roots or stems; others, flowers or fruits. Process them according to the formula, ensuring utmost cleanliness. Then measure and weigh precisely, avoiding discrepancies.

Medicines interact—some enhance, others counteract. Their potencies vary, with sovereigns, ministers, assistants, and envoys working in harmony. Without broad knowledge of the classics, one cannot discern good from bad. If a physician arbitrarily adjusts dosages, ignoring the formula’s proportions, the herbs and minerals will contend in strength, failing to cure and instead causing conflict within the body. Like clashing blades, they induce confusion. If properly balanced, even if the illness is not cured, the five *zang* organs will remain stable, and the condition will not worsen.

As a rule: In classical formulas, processing methods are annotated. Here, they are consolidated in this section to avoid repetition.

After selecting, processing, and roasting medicines, weigh them for use—do not weigh them raw.

For stone medicines and jade, crush them to rice-grain size and wrap them in silk before steeping in decoctions or wine.

For stalactites and other stones, grind them with a jade pestle in water for three days and nights, washing and refining until extremely fine.

For silver filings, mix with mercury into a paste.

For arsenolite, form into balls with red clay, fire for half a day until ready—do not overcook.

Unprocessed arsenolite in medicine ruptures the heart and liver.

For *mirabilite* and *alum*, burn until their juices are exhausted before using in pills or powders.

For *sodium sulfate* and *mirabilite*, strain and boil the liquid two or three times until fully dissolved before consumption.

When using *cinnabar* or *realgar* in decoctions, grind them finely like powder and add to the decoction just before drinking, stirring well.

For whole ingredients in decoctions—such as dried jujubes or gardenia—break them open.

For small-seeded ingredients—like *cornus*, *schisandra*, *ligustrum*, or *cassia*—crush them.

For fine seeds or flowers—such as *inula*, *chrysanthemum*, *kochia*, or *mallow*—use them whole.

Grains like rice, wheat, and beans are also used whole."

For *tangerine peel*, *evodia fruit*, and *pepper*, do not □-crush when adding to decoctions.

For all fruit kernels, remove the tips and any double kernels; for decoctions, rub and strike to remove the skins, then cut them.

When using *gardenia*, remove the skin; when using *cattail pollen*, add it after the decoction is complete.

For *ophiopogon* and fresh ginger in decoctions, cut them, pound three times, and press to extract the juice; strain and remove the dregs before adding, then boil for five or six bubbles according to the prescribed volume—do not boil them together with other medicines. An alternative method is to slice them thinly for use.

For *ophiopogon*, lightly moisten and remove the core.

For *ephedra*, remove the nodes, first boil separately for two or three bubbles, skim off the foam, then add water to restore the original volume before adding the remaining medicines—otherwise, it will cause restlessness. Cut into inch-long segments.

For *small polygala* and *dianthus*, cut into five-part segments; for *asarum* and *cynanchum*, cut into three-part segments; for pastes, chop finely.

For *achyranthes* and *dendrobium* in decoctions or medicinal wines, crush them for use. For *dendrobium* in pills or powders, first pound thoroughly with a mallet until broken, then transfer to a mortar—otherwise, it will not be properly pulverized; the same applies when adding to wine.

For *cinnamon*, *magnolia bark*, *eucommia*, *fraxinus bark*, *magnolia* and the like, scrape off the outer soft, rough bark and use only the inner, flavorful portion for weighing.

For *poria* and *polyporus*, peel away the black skin.

For *moutan*, *morinda*, *polygala*, *gelsemium*, and the like, pound to remove the cores.

For *aster*, wash away the dirt, dry in the sun, then weigh.

For *Chinese scallion* and *green onion*, remove all green parts.

For *illicium*, *photinia*, *skimmia*, and *eupatorium*, pick the leaves and tender stems, discarding the thick branches.

For *podophyllum* and *coptis*, remove the root hairs.

For *pyrrosia* and *magnolia flower*, wipe away the hairs; for *magnolia flower*, also remove the core.

For *Sichuan pepper*, discard any closed or "eyed" fruits.

For *jujubes* and *mume plums*, remove the pits.

For *euonymus*, shave off the feather-like bark.

For *poria* and *peony*: in tonifying medicines, use the white variety; in purgative medicines, use only the red.

For *cuscuta seeds*, rinse with warm water to remove sand and soil, dry in the sun, then soak in mild wine overnight; strain and dry until slightly white, then pound. For any remaining uncrushed seeds, soak again in wine for three to five days before straining, drying slightly, and pounding again—ensure all seeds are thoroughly crushed and easily pulverized.

For medicines like *licorice*, *magnolia bark*, *bitter orange*, *photinia*, *skimmia*, *veratrum*, and *gleditsia*, roast them. For *bitter orange*, remove the inner pith; for *veratrum*, remove the root tips; for *gleditsia*, remove the skin and seeds.

For *pepper fruits*, lightly roast until they sweat, which enhances their potency.

For decoctions, pills, or powders using *aconite*, *prepared aconite*, *monkshood*, *wolfsbane*, or *wild aconite*, roast in hot ashes until slightly cracked, then peel away the black skin before weighing. Only in *ginger-aconite decoction* and pastes or medicinal wines may they be used raw—also peel away the skin before weighing, and split along the grain into seven or eight pieces.

For *pinellia*, wash in hot water to remove the slippery coating—some say to wash ten times and break into four pieces before weighing for use in decoctions. For pastes, wines, pills, or powders, roast in hot ashes.

For *croton seeds*, remove the skin, core, and membrane, then roast until purple.

For oily medicines like *peach kernels*, *apricot kernels*, *pepperweed*, and *sesame*, roast until yellow-black, then pound separately into a paste until smooth and glossy; gradually add this to the prepared powder in the mortar, grinding until fully dispersed. Then sift through fine silk, ensuring all is pulverized, and return to the mortar to pound several hundred times as required.

Though some may be used raw in decoctions or pastes, all must be crushed.

For *malt*, *fermented leaven*, *soybean sprouts*, *eupatorium*, and *elm cake*, lightly stir-fry.

For *dried lacquer*, stir-fry until the smoke ceases.

For *mume plums* in pills or powders, roast them.

For *processed mugwort*, first stir-fry, then shred finely; mix with other medicines and pound until finely dispersed—anything that cannot be sifted should be blended into the powder.

For all animal hairs, feathers, teeth, hooves, shells, scales, skins, flesh, bones, antlers, and sinews—such as tortoise and turtle shells, pangolin scales, deer antlers, and the like—roast them.

For *snake slough*, lightly roast.

For insects like *blister beetles*, remove the wings and legs, then lightly roast.

For *mantis egg-cases*, split and roast them.

For *oyster shells*, roast until yellow.

For *silkworm pupae* and *hornet nests*, lightly stir-fry.

For medicines like *musk*, *rhinoceros horn*, *deer antler*, *antelope horn*, and *bezoar* in decoctions, grind into fine powder and add to the decoction just before drinking, stirring well to blend.

For pills or powders using *gelatin*, first roast until it swells and dries throughout; if any part does not swell, roast further. For direct use in decoctions, do not roast. For *donkey-hide gelatin* in decoctions, strain the decoction first, then add the gelatin and boil two or three more times until fully dissolved.

For *honey*, first simmer over fire, skimming off the foam until it turns slightly yellow—this ensures pills will not spoil over time. The amount skimmed depends on the honey’s purity; the thicker it becomes, the better for pill-making.

For *wax* in pills, melt and mix with a small amount of honey to blend with the medicines.

For *malt sugar* in decoctions, add after the decoction is complete.

For decoctions using *wine*, add it just before the decoction is done.

Some medicines are suited for pills, some for powders, some for decoctions, some for medicinal wines, some for pastes—some may serve multiple purposes, while others should not be used in decoctions or wines. Follow the nature of each medicine; do not violate these principles.

Those unsuitable for decoctions or wines are listed below:
*Cinnabar* (roasted for wine), *orpiment*, *mica*, *actinolite* (for wine), *alum* (for wine), *sulfur* (for wine), *stalactite* (for wine), *calcareous sinter* (for wine), *arsenolite* (for wine), *silver filings*, *chalk*, *bronze mirror shavings*, *lead powder*, *red lead*, *bittern* (for wine), *lime* (for wine), *alkali ash*.

The above comprises seventeen types of minerals.

*Wild aconite*, *langdu* (wolf’s-bane), *dugong*, *ghost’s umbrella*, *illicium*, *shuodiao* (steeped in wine), *croton*, *rhododendron* (steeped in wine), *Chinese honey locust* (steeped in wine), *guanjun* (mushroom), *false hellebore*, *qianru*, *aspidium* (steeped in wine), *elm cake*, *thunderball fungus*, *langya*, *iris root*, *caltrop* (steeped in wine), *aster*, *xanthium*, *trumpet creeper* (steeped in wine), *spreading hedyotis* (steeped in wine), *bletilla*, *peony root*, *flying thistle*, *snake’s tongue*, *zhansi*, *magnolia flower*, *photinia* (steeped in wine), *melia fruit*, *giant knotweed* (steeped alone), *jack-in-the-pulpit*, *madder root*, *yangtao* (steeped in wine), *hemp pollen*, *bitter gourd*, *melon stalk*, *zheli*, *langbazi* (steeped in wine), *cloud seed*, *pagoda tree seed* (steeped in wine), *broom cypress seed*, *cnidium seed* (steeped in wine), *feather cockscomb seed*, *motherwort seed*, *vaccaria seed*, *dodder seed* (steeped in wine). The above comprises forty-eight types of herbs and trees.

*Bee larvae*, *beeswax*, *white horse penis*, *dog’s penis*, *sparrow eggs*, *chicken eggs*, *male magpie*, *bat*, *woodlouse*, *ailanthus silk moth*, *firefly*, *mud dauber*, *silkworm moth*, *centipede*, *lizard*, *blister beetle*, *cantharides*, *tiger beetle*, *snake gall*, *horsefly*, *cockroach*, *mole cricket*, *razor clam*, *ochre snail*, *toad*, *hedgehog skin*, *raw rat*, *raw tortoise* (steeped in wine), *snail*, *various birds and beasts* (steeped in wine), *insects, fish, fats, bones, marrow, gall, blood, feces, and urine*. The above comprises twenty-nine types of insects and animals.

Ancient scales used only *zhu* and *liang*, with no *fen* as a unit. Now, ten millet grains equal one *zhu*, six *zhu* equal one *fen*, four *fen* equal one *liang*, and sixteen *liang* equal one *jin*—this is the weighing system of Shennong. The people of Wu use two *liang* as one *liang*, while the people of Sui use three *liang* as one *liang*. Now, we adopt the standard of four *fen* as one *liang*.

When physicians speak of "equal parts," this applies to pills and powders, where the quantity varies according to the severity of the illness, with no fixed weight. Whether three or five ingredients are used, their proportions are made equal.

When pills or powders specify a certain weight, this indicates the relative proportions of each medicine—some should be more, some less—not that the total must be limited to that weight. For example, if one takes three *fangcunbi* daily until recovery, this amounts to only three to five *liang* of medicine.

When powders mention a *daogui*, this is one-tenth of a *fangcunbi*, equivalent to the size of a *wutong* seed. A *fangcunbi* is a square spoon one *cun* on each side, used to scoop powder until it no longer falls off. A *qianbi* uses a large coin to scoop the powder fully. A *half-qianbi* means scooping only one side of the coin, using a five-*zhu* coin. A *qianwubi* uses the edge of a five-*zhu* coin where the character "five" appears, scooping until the powder no longer falls off.

One *cuo* equals four *daogui*. Ten *cuo* make one *shao*, and two *shao* make one *ge*. When medicines are measured by volume, this accounts for differences in density and weight, making weight measurements impractical. The medicine *sheng* is a container with an upper diameter of one *cun*, a lower diameter of six *fen*, and a depth of eight *fen*. When filling it with powder, do not press down—simply shake lightly to level it. This method is no longer used today.

For pill sizes: "as fine as sesame" refers to sesame seeds, not necessarily flat, but roughly uniform in size. The same applies to "millet-sized," where sixteen millet grains equal one large soybean. "Hemp seed-sized" refers to modern hemp seeds, equivalent to three fine sesame seeds. "Hu bean-sized" refers to modern green mottled beans, equivalent to two hemp seeds. "Small bean-sized" refers to modern red adzuki beans, which vary in size but are equivalent to three hemp seeds. "Large bean-sized" is equivalent to two small beans. "Wutong seed-sized" is equivalent to two large beans. Ten *wutong* seed-sized pills made from one *fangcunbi* of powder mixed with honey serve as the standard.

"Pellet-sized" or "chicken egg yolk-sized" is equivalent to ten *wutong* seeds.

When a formula specifies a certain number of *croton* seeds, note that their size varies. First remove the core and skin, then weigh them—sixteen seeds equal one *fen*. For *aconite* or *monkshood*, remove the skin and weigh—one *liang* equals two roots. For *bitter orange*, remove the pith and weigh—two pieces equal one *fen*. Three *tangerine peels* equal one *fen*. Dates vary in size, but three equal one *liang*. When dried ginger is described as "a cluster," the correct weight is half a *liang* (though the *Bencao* states one *liang*).

When a formula specifies one *sheng* of *pinellia*, wash it and weigh—five *liang* is correct. One *sheng* of *pepper* equals three *liang*. One *sheng* of *evodia* equals five *liang*. One *sheng* of *dodder seeds* equals nine *liang*. One *sheng* of *artemisia* equals four *liang*. One *sheng* of *cnidium seeds* equals three and a half *liang*. One *sheng* of *broom cypress seeds* equals four *liang*. These measurements differ.

When a formula specifies one *sheng* of a certain seed, note that seeds vary in density and weight, making weight measurements unreliable. Always use a level *sheng* for accuracy.

When a formula specifies one *chi* of *cassia*, peel it and weigh—half a *liang* is correct. One *chi* of *licorice* weighs two *liang*. When herbs are specified as "a bundle," this weighs three *liang*; "a handful" weighs two *liang*.

When a formula specifies one *jin* of honey, this equals seven *ge*. One *jin* of lard equals one *sheng* and two *ge*.

In old formulas, medicines for decoctions, wines, or ointments are often described as "chopped" (*jujue*), meaning they are weighed, pounded to the size of soybeans, and the fine powder is blown away. This method is impractical, as medicines vary in brittleness, producing uneven amounts of powder, and the weight is no longer uniform.

Now cut all ingredients finely, roughly matching the size of the *jujue* fragments, so that no powder remains and the pieces are uniform. When a formula specifies "powdered," this means to pound and sift according to method.

For pills and powders, first cut the ingredients finely, dry them in the sun, then pound them. Some are pounded separately, others together—follow the formula’s instructions. For moist herbs such as *tianmendong* or dried *dihuang*, first cut them, dry in the sun, pound separately until partially broken, then tear into smaller pieces and dry again. If encountering overcast or rainy weather, gently warm over a low fire, and once dry, allow to cool slightly before pounding.

Moist herbs lose much volume when dried, so increase the weight beforehand, and only measure once they are reduced to flakes—this does not apply to decoctions or wines. For sifting pill ingredients, use tightly woven silk to ensure fineness, making honeyed pills easier to cook. For sifting powders, use loosely woven silk for herbs, so they dissolve smoothly in wine. Mineral drugs should also be sifted with fine silk, like pill ingredients.

After sifting pills or powders, combine them in a mortar and pound several hundred times until the color and texture are uniform. For decoctions, use fresh well water, thoroughly purified, and measure precisely—do not alter the volume. Boil with care, regulating the fire as in alchemical refining.

When decocting, use a gentle flame to maintain a slight boil. The water volume depends on the formula, but generally, twenty *liang* of herbs use one *dou* of water, boiled down to four *sheng*—use this as a standard. Strain the dregs before measuring the liquid.

For purgative decoctions, use less water and extract more liquid, as the illness requires swift relief. For restorative decoctions, use more water and extract less liquid, as the illness requires nourishment. Carefully adjust the water volume—do not err in excess or deficiency.

Once the decoction is ready, strain it through new cloth with two people using a wooden rod, then clarify by settling the sediment. For divided doses, cover the second and third servings with paper to prevent qi from escaping. Warm the dose in a copper vessel over hot water, ensuring no moisture remains inside.

For medicinal wines, always cut the ingredients finely, place them in a raw silk bag, then steep in wine and seal tightly. The duration depends on the season; when the brew becomes strong, strain it out—there is no need to wait until the wine is exhausted. Dry the dregs in the sun, lightly pound them, and steep again for drinking, or take as a powder.

For restorative decoctions like *Jianzhong* or *Shenli*, combine the dregs of two doses, add water, and boil to exhaustion for drinking—this is equivalent to one fresh dose. The poor should follow this method, but first dry the dregs in the sun.

For ointments, first soak the ingredients in vinegar, ensuring they are fully submerged but not overly saturated, then cover tightly to prevent leakage. "One day and night" refers to a full day, from dawn to the next dawn, though some require only one night.

When cooking ointments, perform "three risings and three fallings" to dissipate heat and extract the medicinal essence. Raise the mixture to a gentle boil, then lower it, repeating until the liquid settles for a long while—slightly undercooked is preferable. For ingredients like *xiebai*, lightly fry until pale yellow. For *baizhi* or *fuzi*, fry until lightly yellowed.

Use lard that has not been exposed to water, preferably from the twelfth lunar month. Strain ointments through new cloth. If the ointment is for internal use, the dregs can be boiled in wine for drinking. If for external application, apply the dregs directly to the affected area—this ensures full utilization of the medicinal power.

For ointments containing *xionghuang* or *zhusha*, pound them separately into a fine powder like flour, then add to the strained ointment, stirring rapidly until it thickens—prevent settling at the bottom. For mercury, grind it into the congealed ointment until fully dispersed; the same applies to lead powder.

When pounding medicines, burn incense, sweep clean, and maintain silence—no idle chatter or noise. Have a child do the pounding, ensuring thoroughness and fineness. The pestle should strike tens of thousands of times; more is better.

When preparing *Shenqi* pills, *Shuyu* restoratives, major five-stone tonics, large musk pills, *Jinya* powder, or thick wine-based ointments, neither the compounding nor the cooking should be witnessed by women, children, postpartum women, those in mourning, the chronically ill, the disabled, or animals like chickens, dogs, or livestock. This is strictly forbidden—exercise utmost caution. Minor decoctions like *Xuming* or *Mahuang* are exempt from these restrictions.

Recently, rural households purchasing medicines from markets often hire random laborers to pound and prepare them. Not only do they fail to follow proper methods, but for hard-to-pound herbs like *shihu* or *tusizi*, the hired workers secretly discard them, wasting effort. Dust and impurities contaminate the medicine, and coarse sifting allows powder to scatter in the wind. Many taste and smell it, dissipating its essence entirely—rendering it no better than rotten wood.

Furthermore, they do not follow proper administration, and after finishing the course, their condition worsens, leading them to slander the physician’s prescriptions as ineffective. Such failures are not the fault of the medicine but stem from their own misguided approach—ponder this carefully.

**On Administration (Section Eight)**
When using toxic medicines to treat illness, begin with a dose the size of a millet grain. If the illness subsides, stop; if not, double the dose. If still ineffective, increase tenfold, continuing until the illness is cured.

For illnesses above the chest and diaphragm, eat first, then take the medicine. For illnesses below the heart and abdomen, take the medicine first, then eat.

For illnesses in the limbs and blood vessels, take medicine on an empty stomach at dawn. For illnesses in the bones and marrow, take medicine after a full meal at night.

When taking pills or powders, if the prescription does not specify whether to use wine or water, it may be taken with either as appropriate. For purgative decoctions, take them early in the morning. For all decoctions, take them slightly warm—they will be easily digested and not induce vomiting. If taken cold, they may cause vomiting and fail to descend; if too hot, they may scald the throat. Careful attention is required.

Decoctions must be clear; if turbid, they will cause heart discomfort and fail to resolve the condition. Space doses apart by the time it takes to walk ten *li*; if taken too frequently, the previous dose will not yet have dissipated when the next arrives, leading to vomiting and counterflow. Always ask the patient whether the medicine in their abdomen has dispersed before administering the next dose.

Generally, decoctions are divided into three doses, totaling three *sheng*. Adjust according to the patient’s digestive strength: the first dose should be the largest, the second slightly smaller, and the third the smallest. This ensures stability. As the patient’s strength gradually weakens, the dosage should decrease accordingly.

For restorative decoctions, take three and a half *sheng* over the course of a day—three doses by day and one by night—with meals in between. This allows the decoction’s *qi* to irrigate the hundred vessels, making the medicine’s effects more readily felt.

When taking decoctions, avoid extremes of speed or slowness. After ingestion, lie down alternately on the left and right sides for the time it takes to eat a meal, allowing the decoction’s potency to spread throughout the abdomen. Walk about one hundred steps indoors, but do not go outside for the entire day—this will be greatly beneficial.

For three days after taking decoctions, avoid wine, as it is incompatible with the medicine.

When taking decoctions for wind disorders, cover the patient thickly for the first dose to induce sweating. Once sweating begins, reduce the covering to avoid excessive perspiration. Meals should also be taken in between; otherwise, the patient may grow weak and emaciated.

Pills are generally the size of *wutong* seeds. For restorative pills, begin with ten and gradually increase the dose over time, not exceeding forty pills. Excessive doses may harm the patient. If the prescription states "take three times a day," extend the duration over many days without interruption. As the medicine’s *qi* gradually permeates and warms the five viscera, prolonged use yields the best results. There is no need to take the entire course at once for immediate completion—this wastes the medicine and yields little benefit.

For those under forty with illness, purgative medicines may be used, though restorative medicines are not strictly necessary. If there is damage, this does not apply. For those over forty, purgative medicines should not be used; restorative medicines are required. For those over fifty, restorative medicines should be taken in all four seasons without interruption—this is the way to prolong life and attain the art of nourishing vitality. The relevant formulas are found in the twenty-seventh scroll.

The *Suwen* states: "For excess, purge; for deficiency, tonify. For neither excess nor deficiency, regulate according to the channels." This is the general principle.

For accumulations and gatherings in the viscera and bowels, regardless of age, purge when necessary. For deficiencies and damage, regardless of age, tonify when necessary. Use judgment in applying these methods.

When taking medicines for hemorrhoids, fistulas, or gan sores, avoid pork, chicken, fish, and oily foods until recovery.

When taking purgative medicines, use bowel movement as the measure—do not exceed, lest it cause uncontrolled diarrhea and severely harm the patient.

After recovering from malignant sores, avoid certain foods for one hundred days; otherwise, the sores may recur.

When taking medicinal wines, ensure the wine’s *qi* remains continuous without interruption, or the medicine’s effects will not be felt. The amount should be determined by the patient’s tolerance—do not allow intoxication or vomiting, as this greatly harms the patient.

When taking medicines, avoid raw and cold foods, vinegar, slippery foods, pork, dog, chicken, fish, oil, wheat noodles, garlic, and fruits. For major restorative pills and powders, strictly avoid stale, rancid, or spoiled foods.

When taking *kongqing*, avoid raw blood-based foods. For *tianmendong*, avoid carp. For *baimu*, avoid peaches, plums, sparrow meat, coriander, garlic, black carp, and vinegar. For *dihuang*, avoid *wuyi*. For *gancao*, avoid *song* greens and seaweed. For *xixin*, avoid raw vegetables. For *tusizi*, avoid rabbit meat. For *niuxi*, avoid beef. For *huanglian* and *jiegeng*, avoid pork. For *mudan*, avoid *huwei*. For *lilu*, avoid leopard cat meat. For *banxia* and *changpu*, avoid malt sugar and mutton. For *hengshan* and *guixin*, avoid raw onions and raw vegetables. For *shanglu*, avoid dog meat. For *fuling*, avoid vinegar-based foods. For *baiziren*, avoid wet wheat noodles. For *badou*, avoid reed shoots and pork. For *biejia*, avoid amaranth.

When taking medicines, avoid contact with corpses, postpartum women’s impurities, as well as anger, sorrow, and fatigue.

When consuming decoctions, ensure that porridge, meat, and vegetables are thoroughly cooked—this aids digestion and harmonizes with the medicine. Raw foods are difficult to digest and may diminish the medicine’s effects. Eat fewer vegetables and hard foods, as they are more compatible with the medicine. Reduce salt and vinegar intake as well. Avoid mental strain, physical exertion, sexual activity, and emotional extremes.

Thus, in treating illness with medicine, proper diet and care contribute more than half the benefit. Therefore, patients must focus on careful regulation and restraint. With the utmost regulation and restraint, one may attain longevity—how much more so for merely curing illness.

When taking purgative decoctions, pills, powders, or medicinal wines, if food is to be consumed at mealtime, first give a sip of cold vinegar, then eat after a short while—this is best.

If one suddenly encounters wind, leading to sudden malaise in body and mind, or even inability to speak, take Major or Minor *Xuming* Decoction, *Xizhou Xuming* Decoction, *Paifeng* Decoction, or *Yuebi* Decoction. Administer four or five doses day and night in a windless, secluded room, without regard to quantity. Do not fear deficiency—ensure continuous sweating from the head, face, hands, feet, abdomen, and back for the best results.

When taking decoctions, consume congee once the decoction has been digested, and resume the decoction once the congee has been digested. Also, take a small amount of mutton stew for nourishment. If the wind affliction is severe, continue taking the decoction for five days and nights without interruption, then pause for two days, replenishing with broths and stews to restore the body and rest the limbs. If slight recovery occurs, discontinue the medicine and gradually recuperate. Should the condition not improve, resume taking the decoction to attack the illness until recovery is achieved.

For those suffering from wind afflictions, the wind will not depart without profuse sweating. Thus, all wind remedies include *mahuang* (ephedra). For instance, *Xizhou Xuming* Decoction uses eight *liang*, *Yuebi* Decoction uses six *liang*, while Major and Minor *Xuming* Decoctions may use one, three, or four *liang*—this confirms that recovery is impossible without sweating. Therefore, treating wind afflictions requires a secluded chamber; taking decoctions carelessly is self-defeating and only exacerbates the condition, never alleviating it.

For those over fifty who are greatly debilitated, take *Sanshi Gengsheng* (Three-Stone Rejuvenation), but never use *Wushi* (Five-Stone). In all four seasons, drink one or two *sheng* of warmed decoction at dawn, continuing this practice for life without interruption. At the same time, avoid garlic, oil, fish, pork, beef, horse, chicken, goose, and duck meat—thus, one will remain free of illness.

**On Storing Medicines, Ninth**
To remember the lost while at peace, and to remain vigilant in safety—this is the supreme teaching of the great sages.

To relieve the people’s suffering and attend to their hidden afflictions—this is the intent of the worthy. Thus did Shennong gather the hundred medicines, and the Yellow Emperor compile the *Canon of Acupuncture*, both as essential measures of preparedness. For illness often strikes suddenly, unannounced, and without warning; once stricken, how can one hastily seek a remedy?

Those of good intent should store medicines in advance to meet unforeseen needs. Though the initial effort may seem slight, the lives saved will be many. Consider how families of wealth and rank, when raising fine horses, keep dozens of *jin* of veterinary medicines on hand—yet none store even a *zhu* of human remedies. Such a comparison is deeply shameful. To value beasts over one’s own body is truly a disgrace. The saying goes, “Why inquire after the horse when the man is injured?”—of what use is such a sentiment?

Moreover, when officials or private messengers travel to distant frontiers—barren lands where no herbs grow—should they suddenly encounter miasmic pestilence without prior preparation, they will have nothing to treat their illness. Helpless, they will fold their hands and await death, meeting an untimely end. Such a fate is self-inflicted, not an unjust misfortune. For if one fails to guard oneself with foresight, how can one lament the lateness of regret when disaster strikes?

Thus, the method of storing medicines is set forth to avert peril. The following are to be prepared:

Stone medicines, ash and earth medicines, water medicines, root medicines, stem medicines, leaf medicines, flower medicines, bark medicines, seed medicines, the five grains, the five fruits, the five vegetables, and medicines derived from the teeth, bones, horns, hooves, claws, hides, fur, urine, and dung of various beasts; as well as ghee, marrow, milk, yogurt, *tihu* (clarified butter), rock honey, granulated sugar, malt sugar, fermented grain syrup, wine, vinegar, glue, flour, and fermented beans.

The above medicines should be gathered in season and stored. Medicines derived from insects and silkworms are not to be collected.

Essential tools for compounding include: scales, pecks, *sheng*, *ge*, iron mortars, wooden mortars, silk sieves, gauze sieves, horsehair sieves, knives, chopping blocks, jade pestles, porcelain bowls, large and small bronze *yao* vessels, cauldrons, copper and iron spoons.

All these must be prepared in advance.

Medicines should not be repeatedly exposed to sun and wind, for their potency will weaken and dissipate—this must be well understood. For medicines not immediately needed, wait for a clear, sunny day to dry them thoroughly in strong sunlight, then store them in new earthenware vessels, sealing the lids tightly with clay. When opening to retrieve some, reseal promptly to prevent exposure to wind or damp. Even after years, they will remain as fresh as new.

For pills and powders, store in porcelain vessels and seal with wax to prevent leakage of *qi*—thus they will keep for thirty years without spoiling. For apricot kernels and other seed medicines, earthenware vessels will prevent mice from reaching them.

In all methods of storage, keep medicines three to four *chi* above the ground to avoid dampness from the earth.

**Sun Zhenren’s Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold for Emergency Use: General Principles**

The *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold* originally contained several dozen principles scattered throughout its chapters. Whenever applying a method, one should thoroughly understand them all. Even those well-versed in the text may still fear omissions when treating an illness, let alone in sudden emergencies when matching symptoms to remedies, where confusion is inevitable. As new material has been added and organized, it is essential to establish clear guidelines. Here, I have compiled the old principles along with new editorial insights into a single chapter, placed after this preface, so that future practitioners may apply them without hindrance.

**On Measurement in Formulas**
The art of compounding medicines involves weights and measures such as *jin*, *liang*, *sheng*, *ge*, *chi*, and *cun*. Those who prepare decoctions must be familiar with these. In Wu, there were double and single steelyards; in Sui, large and small *sheng* measures. Though these systems varied, the confusion arose from overcomplicating them rather than grasping their essence. Tao Hongjing, in his *Preface to the Materia Medica*, adopted the method of measuring by millet grains, following the ancient steelyard of Shennong, which Sun Simiao also employed. Sun lived from the late Sui to the Yongchun era of Tang, having witnessed the systems recorded in the *Sui Treatise* and *Tang Statutes*. Thus, this book should use the system where three *liang* equal one *liang* and three *sheng* equal one *sheng*. Some reckless individuals claim that ancient and modern people differ in size, hence the larger doses in old prescriptions. Such baseless assertions are the height of absurdity. Today, when using medicines, one *liang* of the old measure should equal three *liang* of the current measure, and one *sheng* of the old measure should equal three *sheng* of the current measure. Though formulas occasionally use *chi* and *cun*, the old principles already provide conversions to *jin* and *liang*, so they will not be repeated here.

**On Decoctions and Powders**
Ancient formulas for treating illness relied entirely on decoctions, with not a single one using powders among hundreds or thousands. Modern physicians, however, fail to distinguish between decoctions and powders, leading to misguided theories and the perpetuation of errors. Decoctions are prepared by cutting ingredients into pieces the size of hemp or mung beans, while powders are made by grinding, sifting, and pulverizing. For acute illnesses caused by pernicious *qi*, decoctions are needed to flush and cleanse; for chronic or persistent ailments, powders are used for gradual absorption. This was the original intent behind decoctions and boiled powders. Yet modern physicians, seeking convenience, prepare everything as powders, forgetting the method of decoctions. After long misuse, they no longer recognize their error. When decoctions are finally used, they react with unwarranted surprise, unaware that in ancient times, though doses were large, only three or four servings were taken daily, and formulas were specialized. Today, though doses are smaller, multiple medicines are administered simultaneously, with each taken several times. Compared to the past, is this not actually more excessive?

Moreover, when ancient physicians prescribed long-term medication, they often used the method of boiled powders, aiming for cumulative effects over time. Typically, one *fangcunbi* was taken as a single dose, with no more than three *fangcunbi*. The medicine was wrapped in silk and gently shaken while boiling. The ancients’ intent was never to encourage excessive consumption. As for pills, the standard dose was twenty pills the size of firmiana seeds, with no more than thirty or forty. For powders, the minimum was a *daogui* or five *bi*, and the maximum was one *fangcunbi*. Why would decoctions be taken in large amounts while boiled powders, pills, and powders were taken sparingly? Clearly, modern practitioners neither understand the old systems of weights and measures nor the methods of decoctions and boiled powders.

Following the old principles, I have generally set the standard as twenty *liang* of medicine (old measure) and one small *dou* of water, boiled down to one *sheng* and five *ge* (current measure), strained, and divided into three doses. For purgative decoctions, use less water and extract more servings; for tonic decoctions, use more water and extract fewer servings, following the specific instructions under each formula.

**On Processing Medicinal Ingredients**
In ancient medical texts, all methods for frying, refining, and preparing ingredients were annotated at the bottom of each formula. Modern formulas, however, compile methods from various sources into a single section on compounding, without individual annotations. Annotating each formula would be cumbersome and incomplete, while a compiled section is thorough yet concise. For all compounding methods, refer to the first scroll.

**Special Notes on Common Medicines**
- **Aconite (Wu Tou):** Typically described as "blast-fried," this highly toxic substance cannot follow old methods. Instead, adhere to the *Fangji Decoction for Treating Wind-Damp* in the *Arthralgia* section: remove the skin, fry until black, and only then is it safe to use. Otherwise, it remains extremely poisonous—utmost caution is required.
- **Cinnamon (Gui):** Naturally averse to fire and must not be heated. For pregnant women, it may risk disturbing the fetus. Follow the *Fuling Pill* in the *Morning Sickness* section: avoid cinnamon during pregnancy, so fry it before use.
- **Rhubarb (Da Huang):** When used in formulas, follow the method in the *Rehmannia Pill for Carbuncles*: slice thinly, steam with five *sheng* of rice until cooked, then dry in the sun before use.

**On the Use of Medicinal Substances in Formulas**

All medicinal substances in formulas are primarily derived from the *Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica*. Yet, as times differ, so too do the details—what suffices for the learned may not for the common practitioner, and thus clarification is necessary. Ancient texts were concise: *zhuyu* (cornelian cherry) was conflated with *shan* and *hao*; *men dong* (asparagus root) was obscured within *tian* and *mai*; *jiao* (pepper) was not distinguished between *Qin* and *Shu*; and *xing* (apricot kernel) was not separated from *mu* (male) and *man* (creeper). Now, we consult the *Materia Medica* and elaborate on each with precision.

Moreover, modern usage has perpetuated errors. If left uncorrected, harm will multiply. Those seeking true pearls rarely recognize cinnabar as powder, often substituting vermilion; those selecting *tong cao* (rice-paper plant pith) seldom know its alias as *mu tong* (akebia stem), mistaking it for *tong tuo mu* (tetrapanax pith). *Du qiang* (wild rose) is misused for *xi xin* (asarum); *huang qi* (astragalus) is confused with *mu xu* (alfalfa). *Bai xian hua* (dictamnus root bark) is counterfeited with *xian hua* (pigweed), where the thorned variety is genuine. *Qing mu xiang* (aristolochia root) is prized as true *mu xiang* (costus), while the earth-grown form is inferior. *Gui xin* (cassia heartwood) refers to the inner bark of its branches; *gou ji* (cibotium rhizome) need not bear golden hairs. *Shan zhi zi* (gardenia) and *zhi zi* are one and the same; *he li le* (chebulic myrobalan) and *he zi* are not distinct. *Bing lang* (areca nut) and *da fu* (betel husk) were once used interchangeably; *gen shi* (pomegranate rind) and *gen qiao* (pomegranate husk) later spawned needless distinctions. The *zha chan* (cicada) is named for its cry—using the mute variety reveals the error. *Hu ma* (sesame) is named for its origin, and the black variety is authentic. *Tian nan xing* (arisaema) and *hu zhang* (tiger’s paw) differ in name but share the same nature; *yin chen hao* (virgate wormwood) and *yin yin* (skullcap) share a name but are distinct. These are the subtleties of pharmacology—how can physicians afford to overlook them?

Take *bai mu* (white atractylodes), for instance: ancient texts simply called it *mu*, but modern physicians mistakenly equate it with *cang mu* (red atractylodes). Adding the character *bai* (white) now clarifies its identity for practical use.

Some substances in formulas are not recorded in the ancient *Materia Medica*. These are remedies passed down by renowned physicians, either through generations of proven efficacy, broad empirical validation, or personal experience. Master Sun could not discard them, and transmitting them to posterity is no small contribution.

Ancient sages often used living creatures to treat urgent ailments. Though they deemed animals inferior to humans, when it comes to preserving life, the value is the same. Harming one to benefit another offends the natural order—how much more so for humans? To kill for the sake of healing is to distance oneself further from life. Thus, these formulas avoid using living creatures as medicine. However, for substances like *meng chong* (tabanus fly) and *shui zhi* (leech), pre-deceased specimens may be purchased and used—this is an exception. When *ying zi* (oriole eggs) are required, only broken ones are effective; intact eggs are powerless.

Ancient and modern disease names often differ. Without clear distinctions, confusion arises in urgent cases. For example, "yin toxin cold damage" is widely regarded as a severe illness. Many trace its cause to the term *yin du*, assuming it refers to *shaoyin* syndrome or *yin yi* (yin exchange) disorder. Yet one name encompasses three distinct conditions—how can treatment not go astray? In truth, *yin du*, *shaoyin*, and *yin yi* are three separate pathologies, each requiring distinct therapies. Ancient texts clearly delineated them; modern conflation causes grave harm.

Similarly, terms like *chang feng* (intestinal wind), *zang du* (visceral toxin), *ke ni* (hiccup), and *man jing* (chronic fright wind) lack clear definitions in classical texts. Upon close examination: *chang feng* refers to hemorrhoidal bleeding; *zang du* is dysentery with *gu* toxin; *ke ni* is simply *ye ni* (hiccup); and *man jing* is *yin tong* (yin pain). Without reconciling ancient and modern knowledge, how can one serve as a physician?

Furthermore, classical formulas often employ archaic or obscure terms: *li* (dysentery) for *xie xia* (diarrhea); *cu* (contraction) for *jiao qi* (beriberi); *lin* (strangury) for *yin* (turbidity); *shi* (repletion) for *bi* (constipation); *tian xing* (heavenly movement) for *shang han* (cold damage); *bai hu* (white tiger) for *li jie* (severe joint pain); *ge qi* (diaphragm qi) for *gao huang* (consumptive disease); *chuan sou* (wheezing cough) for *ke ni* (hiccup); *qiang zhi* (rigidity) for *jing* (convulsion); *bu yu* (non-speech) for *yu* (recovery); *huan zong* (flaccidity) for *fei* (paralysis); *zheng zhong* (palpitations) for *ji* (fright); *tan* (phlegm) for *yin* (rheum); and *huang* (jaundice) for *zhang* (miasma). Such examples abound—how can they not be examined?

Moreover, diseases may present with overlapping symptoms, or two distinct conditions may share a name. For instance, *shang han* (cold damage), *zhong feng* (wind stroke), *re bing* (heat disease), and *wen yi* (warm epidemic) are all lumped under *shang han*; *fu zhang* (skin distension), *gu zhang* (drum distension), *chang tan* (intestinal mass), and *shi ju* (stone conglomeration) are all classified as *shui qi* (water qi). *Zhong feng* is treated solely with phlegm-resolving formulas; *zhi xia* (dysentery) is mistaken for *lao ji* (consumptive disease); *fu liang* (abdominal mass) is not distinguished from *feng gen* (wind root); and *zhong feng* (wind stroke) is not separated from *shi ji* (seasonal illness). These are the common pitfalls of physicians today—hence this clarification.

Formulas often include prohibitions and contraindications, though these may be absent, brief, or inconsistent. To remedy this, we have compiled all drug interactions—oppositions, aversions, fears, and taboos—as well as miscellaneous prohibitions into a single chapter. Those administering medicines should consult the first volume for reference.

When pills or powders do not specify a vehicle (wine, water, or decoction), the original formula intended as such. If alternative vehicles are mentioned, any of the three may be used.

All formulas and discussions herein derive from ancient masters and Tang-dynasty physicians, adapted for efficacy. Where discrepancies exist among sources, we have annotated them beneath each formula, enabling future practitioners to navigate with clarity.

For chapters treating multiple diseases, we have reorganized them by category, noting in the table of contents: *"[X] disease is appended here."* Where formula names do not match their section titles, we have reordered them for ease of reference in urgent situations.

Ancient physicians often prioritized saving lives in crises, valuing human and animal life equally. To harm one for the sake of another is contrary to nature—how much more so for humans? Killing to heal only distances one from life. Thus, these formulas avoid using living creatures as medicine, except for pre-deceased *meng chong* and *shui zhi*, which may be purchased. Similarly, only broken *ying zi* (oriole eggs) are effective; intact ones are powerless.

Here follows the translation:

---

Where a single formula appears across multiple chapters with identical indications, we have removed the redundancies; where treatments differ, we note: *"The formula appears in [X] volume, [Y] chapter."* For the structure of each chapter, we place discussions first, followed by pulse diagnosis. Major formulas precede simple ones, while acupuncture and moxibustion methods conclude the section. Though detailed, this arrangement remains orderly for urgent reference.

In the women’s volume, the chapters on *deficiency damage* and *tonification* appear similar, yet upon close examination, they follow distinct principles: all major pill formulas belong to *tonification*, while decoctions and infusions pertain to *deficiency damage*. The *head and face* chapter already encompasses treatments for *wind-dizziness*, yet the *Small Intestine* section redundantly includes a *wind-dizziness* entry. This is because the former chapter broadly compiles methods from various schools, while the latter specifically records Xu Sibai’s ten formulas, guiding later practitioners in their choice. Women’s illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat than men’s, hence the need for separate formulas. However, conditions caused by seasonal qi, or those involving deficiency, excess, cold, or heat, are treated similarly to men’s. Other miscellaneous illnesses shared with men are dispersed throughout the volumes.

Pediatric illnesses differ little from adult ones, save for dosage adjustments. The chapters on *fright epilepsy*, *visiting pathogens*, *fontanel resolution*, and *non-walking*—eight or nine in total—are consolidated into one volume, while formulas for *diarrhea* and other conditions remain scattered across chapters, readily accessible upon review.

Acupuncture points are already detailed in the *Mingtang Chapter*. Some points in individual chapters diverge from or are absent in the *Mingtang*, as they record effective transmissions of the time; thus, they need not entirely conform to older classics.

Throughout the volumes, characters often employ loan usages, such as *qian* (乾) for *gan* (干), *shi* (屎) for *shi* (矢), and *rui* (锐) for *dui* (兑). Such cases are numerous, and we have preserved the original text without uniform revision, adhering to ancient conventions.

For each formula and discussion, we have traced their origins and lineages. While we considered annotating these, we deemed it non-essential for physicians. Thus, we have only collated the text, omitting source titles to present a unified work.

**Women’s Remedies: On Seeking Children, First Discourse**

**Formulas, Moxibustion Methods, and the Art of Transforming a Daughter into a Son**

It is said: The reason women have distinct remedies is due to the differences in pregnancy, childbirth, and uterine injuries. Thus, illnesses in women are ten times more difficult to cure than in men. The *Classic* states: Women are gatherings of all yin, constantly dwelling with dampness. From the age of fourteen onward, yin qi surges and overflows. A hundred thoughts pass through the heart, internally injuring the five viscera and externally damaging their appearance. The menstrual flow comes and goes, its cycles overlapping, causing stagnant blood to congeal and the central pathway to sever. The harm and depletion within are too numerous to recount. The raw and cooked viscera, vacillating between deficiency and excess, allow foul blood to leak internally, depleting qi and vessels. Some indulge immoderately in food and drink, suffering manifold injuries; others engage in intercourse before wounds have healed; still others relieve themselves over open latrines, allowing wind to enter from below, resulting in twelve chronic ailments. This is why women have separate remedies. If their illnesses arise from the four seasons’ qi or from patterns of deficiency, excess, cold, or heat, they are the same as in men. Only when pregnant and afflicted with illness should toxic medicines be avoided. For other miscellaneous diseases, which are the same as in men, one may refer to the relevant volumes.

Yet women’s desires exceed those of men, and their susceptibility to illness is twice that of males. Added to this are their attachments of love and hatred, jealousy, and vexation—deeply ingrained and difficult to restrain. Thus, the roots of their illnesses run deep, and cures are hard to achieve. Those who cultivate life must therefore teach their daughters to study these three volumes on women’s remedies, ensuring mastery. Then, in times of sudden need, what cause for fear will there be?

The four virtues are the pivot of a woman’s conduct; childbearing is the lifelong duty of a wife. Without clarity in these matters, how can one avoid premature death or misfortune? Thus, even governesses and attendants must study them. It is fitting to copy a volume and keep it close at hand, prepared for the unforeseen.

It is said: By nature, people wish to surpass others yet resent falling short. When it comes to learning, however, they follow their whims and pursue distractions, neglecting their duties. How many are willing to single-mindedly seek the ultimate principles? Most squander their time in vain, gaining nothing by life’s end. Marriage and child-rearing are the foundation of human relations and the bedrock of royal transformation. The sages established teachings and expounded their essence, yet later generations fail to grasp them. When the moment arrives, they are as dull as fools—this is the folly of merely wishing to surpass others while resenting those ahead. In truth, they do not understand the path to self-improvement, blindly chasing empty reputations and ending in futility.

Here, I set forth the methods for seeking children, bequeathing them to future generations. Those of like mind may peruse them.

It is said: Those who wish to have children must first know the natal destiny of husband and wife, whether their five phases mutually engender and their virtues align, and whether their destinies avoid the child’s positions of decay, desolation, death, or burial. If so, they will surely conceive. If their five phases clash, or if their destinies involve punishment, killing, opposition, or destruction, and fall within the child’s positions of decay, desolation, death, or burial, they will never conceive—let them not waste their efforts. Even if they do conceive, the child will ultimately bring harm. If their phases mutually engender and they encounter fortune and virtue, they must still follow the methods and formulas, avoiding all prohibitions. Then, the children they bear will be perfect in every way, beyond full description. The methods of prohibitions, auspicious days for conception, and the calculation of dominant and noble constellations are found in Volume Twenty-Seven.

It is said: When a couple has no children, it is generally due to both suffering from the five taxations, seven injuries, deficiency, emaciation, and various illnesses, resulting in the misfortune of childlessness. The method of treatment is this: the man takes the *Seven Seeds Powder*, the woman takes the *Purple Stone and Ophiopogon Pill*, along with vaginal suppositories and the *Mirabilite Decoction for Flushing the Womb*—none will fail to conceive.

**Seven Seeds Powder**: A remedy for men with wind-induced deficiency, dim vision, and depleted essence and qi, who have no children. It supplements insufficiency.

*Schisandra fruit, stalactite powder, vitex fruit, dodder seeds, plantago seeds, thlaspi seeds, dendrobium, dried rehmannia, dioscorea, eucommia, deer velvet, polygala—each eight zhu; aconite, cnidium fruit, ligusticum—each six zhu; cornus, aconite (main root), ginseng, poria, astragalus, achyranthes—each five zhu;* #1 *cinnamon bark—ten zhu; cistanche—eleven zhu; morinda root—twelve zhu.*

Grind the twenty-four ingredients to powder and sift. Take one square-inch spoonful with wine, twice daily. If no effect, increase to two spoons, continuing until efficacy is achieved. Observe the same prohibitions as for other medicines. Those who cannot take wine may mix the powder with honey and form it into pills.

*One formula adds eight zhu of raspberry fruit.*

The method for seeking children follows the *Bedchamber Arts* section below.

**Mirabilite Decoction for Flushing the Womb**: A remedy for women who have never conceived since reaching adulthood, or who have been barren for thirty years.

*Mirabilite, moutan, tangkuei, rhubarb, raw peach kernel—each three zhu; asarum, magnolia bark, platycodon, ginseng, red peony, poria, cinnamon bark, licorice, achyranthes, tangerine peel—each two zhu;* #2 *aconite—six zhu; gadflies, leeches—ten each.*

Crush the eighteen ingredients, combine with five sheng of clear wine and five sheng of water, and decoct to three sheng. Divide into four doses, taking three during the day and one at night, spaced three hours apart. Cover the patient to induce slight sweating. If no sweat appears in winter, place her near a fire basket. The decoction will expel stagnant blood and cold, dark pus resembling adzuki bean juice—this is due to such foul matter in the woman’s womb. Some experience lower abdominal pain on cloudy days, or irregular menstruation due to cold blood, preventing conception.

If the decoction is fully consumed but the patient’s qi and strength are weak, leaving her greatly debilitated and unable to continue, the treatment may be halted after two or three doses. Should she feel extreme discomfort, she may take a mouthful of cold vinegar rice or cold water to relieve it. However, there is concern that the foul matter may not be entirely expelled, thus limiting the full effect of the medicine. If she can endure and complete the full course, the outcome will be far better.

One day after taking the decoction, a suppository should be applied.

*The Qianjin Yifang* omits platycodon and licorice.

For cases of complete infertility or interrupted lineage, after taking the preceding *Poxiao Decoction*, apply the following vaginal suppository formula:

Soap bean pod, cornus fruit (*Qianjin Yifang* uses bitter gourd), tangkuei—each one liang; asarum, schisandra fruit, dried ginger—each two liang; rhubarb, alum, halite, Sichuan pepper—each half a liang.

Grind these ten ingredients into powder, fill a silk pouch the size of a finger and three *cun* in length, and insert it into the woman’s vagina. She may sit or lie as she wishes but should avoid hurried movement. Remove it when urinating and replace it with a new one. Apply once daily. This will discharge dark, cold, greenish-yellow fluid; when the discharge ceases, she may resume intimacy and will conceive. If no discharge appears, the treatment may be continued for up to ten days.

One version of the text also includes tingli seed and arsenic, each half a liang. This suppository is used after the *Poxiao Decoction* to ensure complete expulsion of cold, foul matter. If she experiences no pain on cold, overcast days, the suppository need not be applied. Some use salt as a suppository, but it is not as effective as this formula.

After applying the suppository following the *Poxiao Decoction*, wait one day, then take the *Purple Quartz and Asparagus Pill*.

**Purple Quartz and Asparagus Pill**, for complete infertility or interrupted lineage:

Purple quartz, asparagus—each three liang; tangkuei, ligusticum, campsis, selaginella, cinnamon bark, aconite, dried rehmannia, *mumeng* (*Qianjin Yifang* uses vitex, *Waitai* uses *mumeng*), euryale seed, dendrobium, magnolia flower—each two liang; ginseng, mistletoe, dipsacus, asarum, magnolia bark, dried ginger, zanthoxylum, moutan, achyranthes—each thirty zhu; biota seed—one liang; dioscorea, cuttlebone, licorice—each one and a half liang.

Grind these twenty-six ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills with wine, three times daily, gradually increasing to thirty pills, until warmth is felt in the abdomen. Intimacy need not be avoided, but the medicine should not be taken if the husband is away. Follow the same prohibitions as with other medicines. Many who have taken this formula conceive before completing the full course.

**White Vervain Pill**, to enable a woman to bear nine children:

White vervain, asarum, ledebouriella, ginseng, Sichuan pepper, *bailian* (some texts say angelica), cinnamon bark, achyranthes, gentian, *wuyi*, glehnia, peony, schisandra fruit, white silkworm, moutan, *qicao*—each one liang; dried lacquer, biota seed, dried ginger, selaginella, aconite, ligusticum—each thirty zhu; peach kernel, purple quartz—each one and a half liang; stalactite, dried rehmannia, white quartz—each two liang; pillbug—half a liang; leeches, gadflies—fifteen each; zanthoxylum—eighteen zhu. Beat a one-*chi* length of hemp cloth repeatedly, then burn it.

Grind these thirty-two ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take fifteen pills with wine, twice daily, gradually increasing to thirty pills. Some matter will be expelled; if any unusual sensations occur, discontinue use.

**Another formula** for long-term infertility or interrupted lineage, treating upper-body heat and lower-body cold, and addressing all ailments:

White vervain, dried rehmannia, dried ginger, plantago seed, Sichuan pepper—each eighteen zhu; purple quartz, *gaoben*, gypsum, *anxi* seed, selaginella—each thirty zhu; *zelan*, red halloysite, white dragon bone, polygala, ophiopogon, poria, *taiyi yuliang*—each two liang; tangkuei, ligusticum, cnidium—each one liang; angelica, raspberry, peach kernel—each one and a half liang; cinnamon bark, cattail pollen—each two and a half liang; asarum—three liang; tangerine peel—half a liang.

Grind these twenty-eight ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take fifteen pills with wine, twice daily, gradually increasing until an effect is felt, up to fifty pills. Avoid pork, chicken, raw or cold foods, vinegar, fish, garlic, donkey, horse, and beef. Discontinue upon sensing conception.

During the third month, carefully select food; beef liver and heart may be eaten. From the fourth and fifth months onward, this is unnecessary, but avoid intentional killing, as it may shorten the child’s lifespan. If such meat is obtained incidentally, it is highly beneficial.

**Jincheng Magistrate’s White Vervain Pill**, for menstrual blockage, obstruction, and eighteen years of infertility; conception occurred after twenty-eight days of taking this formula:

White vervain, asarum—each thirty zhu; ginseng, *duheng* (*Gujin Luyan* uses oyster shell), *mumeng*, magnolia bark, pinellia, white silkworm, tangkuei, aster—each eighteen zhu; achyranthes, glehnia, dried ginger, gentian—each half a liang; Sichuan pepper, aconite, ledebouriella—each one and a half liang.

Grind these seventeen ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take three pills before meals; if no effect is felt, gradually increase to four or five pills. This medicine should not be taken long-term; discontinue upon sensing conception. Its efficacy is well-proven.

*Cui’s* version includes platycodon and salvia, each eighteen zhu.

**Discourse:**
In ancient times, those seeking children often used *Qingyun Powder* and *Chengze Pill*. Though rarely used today and untested in practice, their methods remain worthy of consideration, and thus they are recorded here.

**Qingyun Powder**, a formula for treating insufficiency of yang qi in men, inability to emit and transform, or failure in conception:
*Fupenzi* (raspberry) and *wuweizi* (schisandra), each one *sheng*; *tusizi* (dodder seed), two *sheng*; *tianxiong* (aconite), one *liang*; *shihu* (dendrobium) and *baimu* (white wood), each three *liang*; *sangjisheng* (mistletoe), four *liang*; *tianmendong* (asparagus root), nine *liang*; *zishiying* (fluorite), two *liang*.
Grind these nine ingredients and sift into powder. Take one *fangcunbi* with wine before meals, three times daily.
For those inherently intolerant to cold, omit *jisheng* and add *xixin* (asarum) four *liang*. For those with sufficient yang qi yet no offspring, omit *shihu* and add fifteen *binglang* (areca nut).

**Chengze Pill**, a formula for treating the thirty-six diseases of the lower burner in women, infertility, and sterility:
*Meiheren* (prinsepia seed) and *xinyi* (magnolia flower), each one *sheng*; *geshangtingzhang* (meloe beetle), seven pieces; *soushu* (mock orange), three *liang*; *gaoben* (ligusticum), one *liang*; *zelanzi* (bugleweed seed), five *ge*.
Grind these six ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take two pills before meals, three times daily; if no effect is felt, gradually increase. If there are no hard masses or accumulations in the abdomen, omit *tingzhang* and add one *liang* of *tongcao* (tetrapanax). For those averse to sweetness, first blend the powder with bitter wine, then add a small amount of honey to form pills.

**Dahuang Pill**, a formula for treating leukorrhea and the hundred diseases, infertility, and inducing discharge of blood after ten days, worms and green-yellow fluid after twenty days, with full recovery by thirty days and plump fairness by fifty days:
*Dahuang* (rhubarb), broken into rice-sized pieces and stir-fried until black; *chaihu* (bupleurum), *poxiao* (mirabilite), and *ganjiang* (dried ginger), each one *sheng*; *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), five *liang*; *shujiao* (Sichuan pepper), two *liang*; *fuling* (poria), one piece the size of a chicken egg.
Grind these seven ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take seven pills before meals with rice water, increasing to ten pills as needed; mild purgation should occur after five days.

**Jixiang Pill**, a formula for treating women who have been infertile for years:
*Tianma* (gastrodia), *liuxu* (willow catkins), *mudan* (tree peony), *fuling* (poria), *gandihuang* (rehmannia), and *guixin* (cinnamon bark), each one *liang*; *wuweizi* (schisandra), *taohua* (peach blossom), *baizhu* (atractylodes), and *shaoqiong* (peony), each two *liang*; *fupenzi* (raspberry), one *dou*; *taoren* (peach kernel), one hundred pieces; *tusizi* (dodder seed) and *chushizi* (paper mulberry seed), each one *sheng*.
Grind these fourteen ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take five pills on an empty stomach with yellow wine, once at midday and once in the evening.

**Xiaoshi Dahuang Pill**, for treating the twelve types of abdominal masses, leukorrhea, sterility, and infertility, as well as those with accumulations after taking cold-food medicines. First administer the *Great Pill* to purge, then take the cold-food medicine. The *Great Pill* does not purge water or grain, only the disease, without causing extreme debility. The formula is found in the eleventh volume.

**Qinjiao Pill**, a formula for treating female sterility, lifelong childlessness, and purifying the viscera to enable the jade gate to receive seminal essence:
*Qinjiao* (gentian) and *tianxiong* (aconite), each eighteen *zhu*; *xuanshen* (scrophularia), *renshen* (ginseng), *bailian* (ampelopsis), *shufu* (woodlouse), *baizhi* (angelica), *huangqi* (astragalus), *jiegeng* (platycodon), *lufengfang* (hornet’s nest), *baijiangcan* (silkworm), *taoren* (peach kernel), *qicao* (grub), *baiwei* (swallowwort), *xixin* (asarum), and *wuyi* (elm cake), each one *liang*; *mumeng* (lithospermum), *shashen* (glehnia), *fangfeng* (ledebouriella), *gancao* (licorice), *mudanpi* (tree peony bark), *niuxi* (achyranthes), *juanbai* (selaginella), *wuweizi* (schisandra), *shaoyao* (peony), *guixin* (cinnamon bark), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *shihu* (dendrobium), and *baimu* (white wood), each thirty-*zhu*; *baiziren* (biota seed), *fuling* (poria), *danggui* (tangkuei), and *ganjiang* (dried ginger), each one and a half *liang*; *zelan* (bugleweed), *gandihuang* (rehmannia), and *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), each one *liang* and eighteen *zhu*; *ganqi* (lacquer), *baishiying* (quartz), *zishiying* (fluorite), and *fuzi* (aconite), each two *liang*; *zhongru* (stalactite), two and a half *liang*; *shuizhi* (leech), seventy pieces; *mengchong* (tabanus), one hundred pieces; *mabu* (hemp cloth), seven *chi* of the knot ends, burned.
Grind these forty-four ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills with wine, twice daily, gradually increasing to twenty pills. If substances resembling bean juice or nasal mucus are discharged, this indicates the disease is being expelled. Discontinue upon sensing any unusual effects.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
For female sterility, apply fifty cones of moxa to *Rangu* (located one *cun* directly below the anterior border of the medial malleolus).
For female infertility and childlessness due to blockage of the uterine gate, apply thirty cones of moxa to *Guanyuan*, repeating as needed.
For women who miscarry or experience abdominal pain and red discharge during pregnancy, apply fifty cones of moxa to *Baomen* (located two *cun* to the left of *Guanyuan*; the point two *cun* to the right is called *Zihu*).
For female infertility and childlessness, apply one hundred cones of moxa to *Qimen* (located three *cun* lateral to *Guanyuan*).
For blockage of the uterus preventing conception and causing pain, apply fifty cones of moxa to *Baomen*.
For female infertility and childlessness with red and white discharge, apply ten cones of moxa to *Quanmen*, repeating three times (the point is located at the upper border of the pubic bone, at the margin of the yin).

**Discourse:**
When yin and yang are harmonized and the two qi interact, yang emits and yin transforms, thus conception occurs. However, where the three yin channels converge, female offspring are more likely. During the second month of pregnancy, it is called *Beginning Fat*, as essence and qi coalesce within the uterine sac. By the third month, it is called *Beginning Embryo*, as blood and vessels cease flowing, form takes shape, and changes occur without fixed pattern, influenced by external stimuli. At this stage, male and female have not yet differentiated, so before the third month, medicines and methods may be employed to transform the fetus into a male.

**Danshen Pill**, a formula for nurturing the fetus upon first awareness of pregnancy and for transforming a female fetus into a male:
*Danshen* (salvia), *xuduan* (dipsacus), *shaoyao* (peony), *baijiao* (donkey-hide gelatin), *baizhu* (atractylodes), and *baiziren* (biota seed), each two *liang*; *renshen* (ginseng), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), and *ganjiang* (dried ginger), each thirty-*zhu*; *wuzhuyu* (evodia), *jupi* (tangerine peel), and *danggui* (tangkuei), each one *liang* and eighteen *zhu*; *baizhi* (angelica) and *guanying* (burned hat tassel), each one *liang*; *gandihuang* (rehmannia), one and a half *liang*; *wuyi* (elm cake), eighteen *zhu*; one pair of dried dog testicles; one head of a rooster from the eastern gate.

Grind the above nineteen ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills with wine, twice daily, gradually increasing to twenty pills.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take one *zhu* of silkworm droppings (or one pellet), and ingest with well-flower water, three times daily.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take one bowstring, place it in a crimson pouch, and tie it to the woman’s left arm. Another method: strike her waist with it one hundred times, then remove it after a hundred days.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take one *liang* of realgar, place it in a crimson pouch, and wear it. To conceive a girl, wear orpiment instead.

**Alternative Formula:**
Place an axe beneath the birthing bed, with the blade facing downward, ensuring no one knows of it. If skeptical, test this during a hen’s incubation: place the axe beneath the nest, and all chicks will hatch as males.

### **Second Discourse on Pregnancy Nausea and Methods for Diagnosis**

**Question:** How can one determine if a woman is pregnant?

**Answer:** A calm and vacuous pulse indicates the capacity to bear children. As the *Classic* states: *"When yin pulses strike and yang pulses differ, this is called having a child."* This describes the harmony of blood and qi, where yang bestows and yin transforms. If the hand *shaoyin* pulse is markedly dynamic, she is pregnant. *Shaoyin* is the heart pulse, and the heart governs blood vessels. The kidneys are also called the *baomen* (womb gate) and *zihu* (child’s door). The *chi* pulse pertains to the kidneys. If the *chi* pulse remains unbroken upon pressure, this indicates pregnancy. If the pulses of the three positions are evenly balanced between sinking and floating, and remain unbroken upon pressure, she is with child.

In early pregnancy, the *cun* pulse is faint and small, with five respirations per breath cycle. By the third month, the *chi* pulse becomes rapid.

To determine the sex of the child in the fourth month:
- A rapid left pulse indicates a boy; a rapid right pulse, a girl.
- If both pulses are rapid, she will bear twins.
Another method:
- A deep and replete left pulse indicates a boy; a floating and large right pulse, a girl.
- If both pulses are deep and replete, she will bear two boys; if both are floating and large, two girls.
- If the *chi* pulse is larger on the left, it is a boy; if larger on the right, a girl. If both are large, she will bear twins. "Large" here resembles a replete pulse.
Another method:
- A floating and large *chi* pulse on the left indicates a boy; a deep and fine *chi* pulse on the right, a girl.
- If the pulse arrives and then ceases, her menses are obstructed.
Another method:
- If both *chi* pulses are floating, she will bear two boys—or else a girl will be born as a boy.
- If both are deep, she will bear two girls—or else a boy will be born as a girl.
Another method:
- A *taiyin* pulse indicates a boy; a *taiyang* pulse, a girl. *Taiyin* pulses sink, while *taiyang* pulses float.

**Alternative Method:**
Have the pregnant woman walk south, then call her back. If she turns her head to the left, it is a boy; to the right, a girl.

**Alternative Method:**
When she rises to use the latrine, have her husband call her urgently from behind. If she turns her head to the left, it is a boy; to the right, a girl.

**Alternative Method:**
If the pregnant woman’s husband has a lump in his left breast, it is a boy; in the right breast, a girl.

To determine impending labor:
- When the pulse of a pregnant woman departs from the norm and floats, and if she experiences abdominal pain radiating to the waist and spine, delivery is imminent.
- If only the pulse departs from the norm, she is not ill.
Another method:
- When labor is near, her pulse departs from the norm. If she feels pain at midnight, she will give birth by midday.

**Discourse:** Generally, women who are weak, emaciated, deficient in blood and qi, or have weak kidney qi—especially those who overindulge in wind exposure or cold drinks—may accumulate bland water beneath the heart. Such women may desire pregnancy but are prone to *zu* (obstruction) illness. Those "desiring pregnancy" still menstruate, with complexion and skin appearing normal, yet they suffer from heaviness, oppression, and listlessness, with no appetite and no clear cause for their distress. If their pulse remains harmonious and even, they are likely pregnant. After two months, if menses cease, the fetus has taken form.

*Zu* illness manifests as heart oppression, head heaviness, dizziness, limb heaviness and fatigue, aversion to work, distaste for food odors, cravings for salty or sour fruits, excessive sleep, and minimal activity—commonly called "aversion to food." By the third or fourth month, symptoms worsen, with severe vomiting and inability to rise.

This arises because menstrual blood has ceased, and water has seeped into the viscera, obstructing visceral qi. Thus, the heart feels vexed and oppressed, qi rebels upward, and vomiting occurs. With blood vessels obstructed and meridians stagnant, the limbs grow heavy. If wind is involved, the head and eyes become dizzy.

Upon recognizing these signs, administer several doses of *Banxia Fuling Tang* (Pinellia and Poria Decoction), followed by *Fuling Wan* (Poria Pill) to dispel bland water and restore appetite. Once she regains strength, her body will grow robust, qi will flourish, and she will have sufficient energy to nourish the fetus, thus restoring the mother’s health.

From ancient times to the present, over ten formulas have treated *zu* illness, regardless of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, or age. Even those near death have been revived by these methods.

**Banxia Fuling Tang (Pinellia and Poria Decoction),**
for treating *zu* illness during pregnancy, characterized by heart oppression, empty vexation, vomiting, aversion to food odors, dizziness, heaviness, pain and fatigue in the limbs and joints, excessive sleep, minimal activity, chills, sweating, extreme fatigue, and emaciation with yellowing complexion:

*Banxia* (pinellia) and *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), each thirty *zhu*; *gandihuang* (rehmannia) and *fuling* (poria), each eighteen *zhu*; *jupi* (tangerine peel), *xuanfuhua* (inula flower), *xixin* (asarum), *renshen* (ginseng), *shaoyao* (peony), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), *jiegeng* (platycodon), and *gancao* (licorice), each twelve *zhu*.

Grind the twelve ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

If *zu* illness persists for months without treatment, or if cold or heat is mismanaged with medication, leading to heat transformation with vexation, thirst, and mouth sores, omit *jupi* (tangerine peel) and *xixin* (asarum), and add *qianhu* (peucedanum) and *zhimu* (anemarrhena), each twelve *zhu*. If cold transforms into diarrhea, omit *gandihuang* (rehmannia) and add *guixin* (cinnamon bark), twelve *zhu*. If appetite is poor, stomach vacuity generates heat, bowels are constipated, and urine is scant and red, add *dahuang* (rhubarb), eighteen *zhu*, omit *dihuang*, and add *huangqin* (scutellaria), six *zhu*.

After taking one dose of the formula and achieving a bowel movement, observe the patient’s strength and the balance of cold and heat to adjust the prescription accordingly. Then administer another dose of the decoction, followed promptly by *Fuling* pills to restore appetite and vigor.

**Avoid:** raw or cold foods, vinegar, greasy or oily foods, *song* vegetables, and seaweed.

**Fuling Pills** treat *zu* illness during pregnancy, marked by vexation and oppression in the heart, dizziness and heaviness of the head, aversion to the smell of food, retching, vomiting, disorientation, and weakness of the limbs so severe one cannot support oneself. The effects are immediate.

First take two doses of *Banxia Fuling* Decoction, then proceed with this formula:
*Fuling* (poria), *renshen* (ginseng), *guixin* (cinnamon bark, stir-fried), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *banxia* (pinellia), and *jupi* (tangerine peel), each one *liang*; *baizhu* (atractylodes), *gegen* (pueraria), *gancao* (licorice), and *zhishi* (unripe bitter orange), each two *liang*.

Grind the ten ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty pills with water, gradually increasing to thirty pills, three times daily.

*The Zhouhou [Fang]* omits *ganjiang*, *banxia*, *jupi*, *baizhu*, and *gegen*, using only five ingredients. It also notes: "Pregnancy contraindicates *gui* (cinnamon), hence it is stir-fried."

**Formula for *e zu* (morning sickness) with vomiting and inability to eat:**
*Qingzhuru* (bamboo shavings) and *jupi* (tangerine peel), each eighteen *zhu*; *fuling* (poria) and *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), each one *liang*; *banxia* (pinellia), thirty *zhu*.

Grind the five ingredients, decoct in six *sheng* of water, and reduce to two and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses. If unresolved, repeat the preparation.

**Jupi Decoction** treats pregnancy-induced vomiting and inability to eat:
*Jupi* (tangerine peel), *zhuru* (bamboo shavings), *renshen* (ginseng), and *baizhu* (atractylodes), each eighteen *zhu*; *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), one *liang*; *houpo* (magnolia bark), twelve *zhu*.

Grind the six ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of water, and reduce to two and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses. If unresolved, repeat the preparation.

### **Chapter Three: Nurturing the Fetus**
#### **Formulas, Prohibitions, and Monthly Fetal Care**

It is said: According to ancient teachings, during the first three months of pregnancy, the fetus undergoes transformation in response to external influences, and its constitution is not yet fixed.

Thus, in the third month of pregnancy, one should observe images of rhinoceroses, elephants, fierce beasts, pearls, jade, and treasures; seek the company of virtuous scholars, noble gentlemen, and masters of great virtue; witness rituals, music, bells, drums, sacrificial vessels, and military arrays; burn fine incense; recite poetry, classics, and ancient admonitions; dwell in simplicity and tranquility; refuse to eat if the food is improperly prepared or the mat is not properly arranged; play the *qin* and *se* to harmonize the spirit and regulate temperament; and moderate desires. By maintaining purity in all matters, the child will be good, long-lived, loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, intelligent, and free from illness. This is the fetal education of King Wen.

It is said: While the child is in the womb, before the months are fulfilled and yin and yang are complete, the organs, viscera, bones, and joints are not yet fully formed. Therefore, from the beginning until the time of delivery, one must observe prohibitions in diet and daily life.

**Dietary Prohibitions During Pregnancy:**
- Eating lamb’s liver causes the child to suffer many misfortunes.
- Eating goat meat causes the child to suffer many illnesses.
- Eating donkey or horse meat prolongs the pregnancy.
- Eating mule meat causes difficult labor.
- Eating rabbit or dog meat causes the child to be mute or have a cleft lip.
- Eating chicken eggs or dried carp causes the child to develop many sores.
- Eating chicken meat or glutinous rice causes the child to suffer from *cunbai* worms.
- Eating mulberries or duck eggs causes the child to be born feet-first with a cold heart.
- Eating sparrow meat with fermented bean paste causes the child to have many moles and dark spots on the face.
- Eating sparrow meat and drinking wine causes the child to be licentious, emotionally unstable, and shameless.
- Eating turtle causes the child to have a short neck.
- Consuming iced beverages terminates the pregnancy.
- Urinating or defecating in unusual places causes miscarriage or endangers the mother’s life.

**Xu Zhicai’s Monthly Fetal Nurturing Formulas:**

**First Month:** Called *beginning of the embryo*.
Diet should be refined and well-cooked, favoring sour and savory flavors. Eat barley and avoid pungent or raw foods. This is called *correcting the foundation*.

In the first month, the foot *jueyin* channel nourishes the fetus. Do not needle or moxa this channel. The foot *jueyin* internally connects to the liver, which governs sinews and blood. During the first month, blood flow is sluggish and stagnant. Avoid strenuous labor, ensure restful sleep, and avoid fear.

In the first month, yin and yang newly unite to form the fetus. Excess cold causes pain; excess heat causes sudden fright. Lifting heavy objects causes lumbar pain, abdominal fullness, and tension in the womb. If sudden discharge occurs, stabilize the condition promptly. The **Black Hen Decoction** is recommended:
One black hen (prepared as for eating), *fuling* (poria) and *ejiao* (ass hide glue), each two *liang*; *wuzhuyu* (evodia), one *sheng*; *maimendong* (ophiopogon), five *ge*; *renshen* (ginseng), *shaoyao* (peony), and *baizhu* (atractylodes), each three *liang*; *gancao* (licorice) and *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), each one *liang*.

Grind the ten ingredients, decoct the hen in twelve *sheng* of water, and reduce to six *sheng* of broth. Remove the hen, add the remaining ingredients, and decoct to three *sheng*. Add three *sheng* of wine and the *ejiao*, melting it completely. Reduce to three *sheng*, cool slightly, and take one *sheng* per dose, three times daily.

**Fetal-Supplementing Decoction:** For those who have previously lost a one-month fetus, take this formula preventively:
*Xixin* (asarum), one *liang*; *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), two *liang*; *gandihuang* (rehmannia), *baizhu* (atractylodes), each three *liang*; *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), four *liang*; *wuzhuyu* (evodia) and barley, each five *ge*; *wumei* (mume), one *sheng*.

Grind the eight ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of water, and reduce to two and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses, taken before meals.

For excess cold, double the *xixin* and *wuzhuyu*; for excess heat with thirst, omit them and add *gualougen* (trichosanthes root), two *liang*. If troubled by longing, omit barley and add *baiziren* (biota seed), three *ge*. One version includes *renshen* (ginseng), one *liang*.

**Second Month:** Called *beginning of the fat*.
Avoid pungent and rank foods. Dwell in quietude. The husband should avoid overwork. Pain in all joints indicates the fetus is beginning to take shape.

In the second month, the foot *shaoyang* channel nourishes the fetus. Do not needle or moxa this channel.

The foot *shaoyang* channel internally connects to the gallbladder and governs essence. In the second month, the child’s essence forms within the womb; one must guard against startling movements. In the second month of pregnancy, *yin* and *yang* first settle into their respective channels. Excess cold may cause miscarriage, while excess heat leads to withering; exposure to wind-cold, sudden jolts, or agitation may result in heart fullness, a suspended tension below the navel, stiffness in the lower back, or sudden discharge. For these conditions, the *aiye* (mugwort leaf) decoction is prescribed:

*Aiye* (mugwort leaf), *danshen* (salvia), *danggui* (Chinese angelica), and *mahuang* (ephedra), each two *liang*; *renshen* (ginseng) and *ejiao* (ass hide glue), each three *liang*; *gancao* (licorice), four *liang*; fresh ginger, six *liang*; and twelve *dazao* (jujubes).

Grind the nine ingredients, decoct in three *sheng* of wine and one *dou* of water, reducing by half. Strain, add the glue, and simmer to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

An alternate version uses one plump black hen, prepared as for eating. Sever its head, collect the blood, and mix with three *sheng* of wine. Then boil the hen in one *dou* two *sheng* of water, strain, and add the medicinal ingredients. Simmer to three *sheng*, then incorporate the blood, wine, and glue. Divide into three warm doses.

For *huanglian* (coptis) decoction, if one has previously miscarried in the second month, take this formula preventively:

*Huanglian* (coptis) and *renshen* (ginseng), each one *liang*; *wuzhuyu* (evodia), five *ge*; fresh ginger, three *liang*; and *shengdihuang* (rehmannia), five *liang* (one version substitutes *ejiao* (ass hide glue)).

Grind the five ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of vinegar-water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken thrice daily and once at night. Prepare a new batch every ten days. If slight discomfort arises, add one *sheng* of *wumei* (mume); when using *wumei*, omit the vinegar-water and use plain water instead. One version includes half a *liang* of *danggui* (Chinese angelica).

**Third Month:** Called *beginning of the fetus*.
At this time, the form is not yet fixed; it takes shape according to what it perceives. To conceive a son, handle bow and arrows; to conceive a daughter, play with pearls. For a beautiful child, frequently gaze upon jade; for a virtuous child, sit upright in tranquil emptiness. This is what is meant by external images shaping internal resonance.

In the third month, the hand *jueyin* (pericardium) channel nourishes the fetus; do not needle or moxa this channel. The hand *jueyin* internally connects to the heart; avoid sorrow, anxiety, and startling movements.

In the third month, the form is established. Cold may cause greenish stool, while heat may lead to difficult urination, which may be neither red nor yellow. Sudden fright, sorrow, anger, joy, falls, or jolts may disturb the channels, causing abdominal fullness, pain around the navel, or lower back pain, with sudden discharge. For these conditions, the *xiongji* (rooster) decoction is prescribed:

One rooster, prepared as for eating; *huangqin* (scutellaria), *baizhu* (atractylodes), and fresh ginger, each one *liang*; *maimendong* (ophiopogon), five *ge*; *shaoyao* (peony), four *liang*; twelve *dazao* (jujubes), split; *gancao* (licorice), *renshen* (ginseng), *fuling* (poria), and *ejiao* (ass hide glue), each two *liang*.

Grind the eleven ingredients, decoct the rooster in one *dou* three *sheng* of water, reducing by half. Remove the rooster, add the medicinal ingredients, and simmer to half. Add three *sheng* of clear wine and the glue, then simmer to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, consuming all in one day. Rest warmly afterward. One version substitutes two *liang* each of *danggui* (Chinese angelica) and *xiongqiong* (ligusticum) for *huangqin* (scutellaria) and fresh ginger.

For *fushen* (poria with hostwood) decoction, if one has previously miscarried in the third month, take this formula preventively:

*Fushen* (poria with hostwood), *danshen* (salvia), and *longgu* (dragon bone), each one *liang*; *ejiao* (ass hide glue), *danggui* (Chinese angelica), *gancao* (licorice), and *renshen* (ginseng), each two *liang*; twenty-one *dazao* (jujubes); and twenty-one *chixiaodou* (adzuki beans).

Grind the nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of vinegar-water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken before meals. Take one dose every seven days thereafter. For lower back pain, add two *liang* of *sangjisheng* (mistletoe). The *Shenshi* version includes two *liang* of *xiebai* (Chinese garlic chives) and one *sheng* of *mazi* (hemp seeds).

**Fourth Month:** The fetus begins to receive the essence of water, forming the blood vessels. Rice is the preferred grain, and fish or wild goose the preferred broths. This nourishes the abundance of *qi* and blood, unblocking the ears and eyes and circulating through the channels.

In the fourth month, the hand *shaoyang* channel nourishes the fetus; do not needle or moxa this channel. The hand *shaoyang* internally connects to the *sanjiao* (triple burner). In the fourth month, the child’s six *fu* organs take shape. Maintain bodily stillness, harmonize the mind, and regulate diet.

In the fourth month, cold may cause a stifling sensation below the heart with nausea, chest fullness, and loss of appetite; heat may cause difficult urination, frequent and dribbling as in *lin* syndrome, or tension below the navel. Sudden wind-cold may cause stiffness and pain in the neck, alternating chills and fever. Startling movements may lead to lower back, abdominal, or wandering pain, with the fetus pressing upward against the chest, causing restlessness. For sudden discharge, the *juhua* (chrysanthemum) decoction is prescribed:

One *juhua* (chrysanthemum) the size of a chicken egg; one *sheng* of *maimendong* (ophiopogon); twelve *dazao* (jujubes); one and a half *liang* of *renshen* (ginseng); two *liang* each of *gancao* (licorice) and *danggui* (Chinese angelica); three *liang* each of *mahuang* (ephedra) and *ejiao* (ass hide glue); four *liang* of *banxia* (pinellia); and five *liang* of fresh ginger.

Grind the ten ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water, reducing by half. Add three *sheng* of clear wine and the glue, then simmer to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, resting warmly afterward. If sweating occurs, dust with powder and guard against wind-cold for four or five days. One version uses one black hen, boiling it in water to decoct the medicinal ingredients.

For *tiaozhong* (middle-regulating) decoction, if one has previously miscarried in the fourth month, take this formula preventively:

Four *liang* each of *baishaoyao* (white peony) and fresh ginger; three *liang* each of *houpo* (magnolia bark), *zhishi* (bitter orange), *shengligenbaipi* (fresh plum root bark), *baizhu* (atractylodes), and *chaihu* (bupleurum); one *liang* each of *xuduan* (dipsacus) and *xiongqiong* (ligusticum); one and a half *liang* of *danggui* (Chinese angelica); one *liang* of *gancao* (licorice); and one *sheng* of *wumei* (mume).

Grind the twelve ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken thrice daily and once at night. Take another dose after eight days.

**Fifth Month:** The fetus begins to receive the essence of fire, forming its *qi*.

Sleep late and rise leisurely, bathe and launder garments, deepen the dwelling’s seclusion, and thicken one’s clothing. At dawn, inhale the celestial light to ward off cold misfortune. Eat rice and wheat, take beef and mutton broth, harmonized with *zhuyu* (evodia) and seasoned with the five flavors—this is called nourishing *qi* to stabilize the five viscera.

In the fifth month of pregnancy, the fetus is nurtured by the Foot Greater Yin channel; one must not needle or cauterize its meridians. The Foot Greater Yin’s inner transport pertains to the spleen. During this month, the child’s four limbs are fully formed. Avoid extreme hunger or satiety, refrain from consuming dry or parched foods, do not expose oneself to excessive heat, and avoid overwork and fatigue.

In the fifth month of pregnancy:
- If heat afflicts one with dizziness, mental confusion, and vomiting;
- If cold afflicts one with abdominal fullness, pain, and frequent urination;
- If sudden fright causes limb pain, alternating chills and fever, erratic fetal movement, abdominal pain, oppression with a desire to collapse, or sudden discharge—*Ejiao* Decoction governs these conditions:

Four *liang* of *ejiao* (ass-hide gelatin); one *liang* of *renshen* (ginseng); six *liang* of fresh ginger; two *liang* each of *danggui* (Chinese angelica), *shaoyao* (peony), *gancao* (licorice), and *huangqin* (scutellaria); two *ge* of *xuanfuhua* (inula flower); seven *ge* of *wuzhuyu* (evodia); and one *sheng* of *maimendong* (ophiopogon).

Grind the ten ingredients, decoct in nine *sheng* of water until reduced by half, then add three *sheng* of clear wine and the gelatin. Simmer over a gentle flame to yield three and a half *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken thrice daily and once at night. Take before meals; if symptoms persist, repeat the dose. Another version uses one black hen: slit its throat to collect blood in the wine, then boil the chicken in water to decoct the herbs, reducing by half before adding the wine and gelatin. Simmer to yield three and a half *sheng*, divided into four doses.

*Anzhong* Decoction—for those who have previously miscarried in the fifth month, take this formula preventively:

One *liang* of *huangqin* (scutellaria); two *liang* each of *danggui* (Chinese angelica), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), *gandihuang* (dried rehmannia), and *renshen* (ginseng); three *liang* each of *gancao* (licorice) and *shaoyao* (peony); six *liang* of fresh ginger; one *sheng* of *maimendong* (ophiopogon); five *ge* each of *wuweizi* (schisandra) and *damaren* (hemp seed); and twenty-five *dazao* (jujubes).

Grind the twelve ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of water and five *sheng* of clear wine, reducing to three and a half *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken thrice daily and once at night. Take another dose after seven days.

In the sixth month of pregnancy, the fetus begins to receive the essence of Metal to form its sinews. The mother should engage in gentle labor and avoid remaining still; she may stroll in the countryside, frequently observe running dogs, and watch galloping horses. She should eat the meat of birds of prey and fierce beasts, for this transforms the interstices of the skin and strengthens the sinews, nurturing her strength and fortifying her back and spine.

In the sixth month, the Foot Yangming channel nourishes the fetus, and one must not needle or cauterize this meridian. The Foot Yangming internally connects to the stomach and governs the mouth and eyes. At six months, the child’s mouth and eyes are fully formed.

Regulate the five flavors, partake of sweet and savory foods, and avoid excessive fullness.

If in the sixth month the pregnancy suddenly becomes unsettled—with alternating chills and fever, abdominal distension and fullness, bodily swelling, fright, sudden discharge, or labor-like abdominal pain accompanied by restless limbs—one should take the *Maimendong* Decoction:

One *sheng* of *maimendong* (ophiopogon); two *liang* each of *renshen* (ginseng), *gancao* (licorice), and *huangqin* (scutellaria); three *liang* of *gandihuang* (dried rehmannia); four *liang* of *ejiao* (ass-hide glue); six *liang* of fresh ginger; and fifteen *dazao* (jujubes).

Grind the eight ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of water until reduced by half, then add two *sheng* of clear wine and the *ejiao*, simmering to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, taking gruel between servings. An alternate method uses one black hen, boiling it in water to decoct the medicine.

*Chaihu* Decoction—for those who have previously miscarried in the sixth month, take this formula preventively:

Four *liang* of *chaihu* (bupleurum); one *liang* of *congong* (cistanche); two *liang* each of *baizhu* (atractylodes), *shaoyao* (peony; one version reads *zisu*), *gancao* (licorice), *maimendong* (ophiopogon), and *xiongqiong* (ligusticum); six *liang* of fresh ginger; five *liang* of *gandihuang* (dried rehmannia); and thirty *dazao* (jujubes).

Grind the ten ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, reducing to three *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taken thrice daily and once at night, with gruel between servings. Avoid raw, cold, and hard foods. Take another dose after seven days.

In the seventh month of pregnancy, the fetus begins to receive the essence of Wood to form its bones. The mother should move her limbs and avoid remaining motionless, engaging in bending and stretching to circulate blood and qi. Her dwelling must be dry, her food and drink kept warm, and she should regularly consume rice and millet to moisten the interstices of the skin with honey, thereby nurturing the bones and strengthening the teeth.

In the seventh month, the Hand Taiyin channel nourishes the fetus, and one must not needle or cauterize this meridian. The Hand Taiyin internally connects to the lungs and governs the skin and hair. At seven months, the child’s skin and hair are fully formed.

She must not speak loudly, wail, wear thin clothing, bathe, or drink cold beverages.

In the seventh month of pregnancy, if sudden fright or agitation occurs, causing abdominal pain and sudden discharge, with cold extremities, a pulse resembling that of cold damage, vexing heat, abdominal fullness, shortness of breath, and persistent stiffness in the neck, nape, waist, and back, the **Scallion White Decoction** is indicated. The formula is as follows:

**Scallion White Decoction**
Scallion whites (3–4 inches long), 14 stalks
Pinellia, 1 *sheng*
Ophiopogon, 1 *sheng*
Inula flower, 2 *ge*
Scutellaria, 1 *liang*
Ginseng, 1.5 *liang*
Licorice, 3 *liang*
Chinese angelica, 3 *liang*
Astragalus, 3 *liang*
Ass-hide glue, 4 *liang*
Fresh ginger, 8 *liang*

Grind the eleven ingredients, then decoct in eight *sheng* of water until reduced by half. Add three *sheng* of clear wine and the ass-hide glue, then simmer to yield four *sheng*. Take one *sheng* per dose, three times during the day and once at night. Rest warmly to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, add one *liang* of ephedra and decoct as before. If this occurs after autumn, do not force sweating. An alternate method uses one yellow hen: slit its throat to collect the blood in wine, then boil the chicken to obtain its broth for decocting the herbs.

**Apricot Kernel Decoction**
For those who have previously suffered miscarriage in the seventh month, this formula should be taken preventively:

Apricot kernel, 2 *liang*
Licorice, 2 *liang*
Aster, 1 *liang*
Stalactite, 3 *liang*
Dried ginger, 3 *liang*
Ophiopogon, 1 *sheng*
Evodia, 1 *sheng*
Polished rice, 5 *ge*
Schisandra, 3 *ge*

Grind the nine ingredients, then decoct in eight *sheng* of water to yield three and a half *sheng*. Divide into four doses, taking three during the day and one at night, with meals in between. One dose should be taken every seven days. An alternate method uses one white hen, boiling it to obtain broth for decocting the herbs.

In the eighth month of pregnancy, the fetus begins to receive the essence of Earth to form its skin and integument. Calm the heart and regulate the breath, avoiding extremes of qi. This is called "sealing the interstices" to enhance the luster of the complexion.

In the eighth month, the Hand Yangming channel nourishes the fetus, and one must not needle or cauterize this meridian. The Hand Yangming internally connects to the large intestine and governs the nine orifices. At eight months, the child’s nine orifices are fully formed.

Do not consume dry or parching foods, do not irregularly miss meals, and do not forcibly rise from a seated position.

In the eighth month of pregnancy, if afflicted by wind-cold or some external assault, the entire body aches, with alternating chills and fever, fetal movement becomes restless, and there is frequent dizziness and headache, cold encircling below the navel, and urine as white as rice-water—sometimes green, sometimes yellow—with shivering, cold and pain in the lower back, and dimmed vision. This is treated with Peony Decoction:

**Peony Decoction**
Peony (four liang), fresh ginger (four liang), magnolia bark (two liang), licorice, tangkuei, atractylodes, and ginseng (each three liang), and chopped scallion (one sheng).
These eight ingredients are prepared by simmering in five sheng of water and four sheng of clear wine, reducing to three sheng. Divide into three doses, taken twice during the day and once at night. An alternate method uses a black hen to make broth for decocting the herbs.

**Mallow Seed Decoction**
For those who have previously injured the fetus in the eighth month, this formula should be taken preventatively:
Mallow seeds (two sheng), licorice, magnolia bark (each two liang), atractylodes, bupleurum (each three liang), peony (four liang), fresh ginger (six liang), and twenty jujubes.
These eight ingredients are simmered in nine sheng of water, reducing to three sheng. Divide into three doses, taken three times daily, with one dose every ten days. An alternate method uses a black hen to make broth for decocting the herbs.

In the ninth month of pregnancy, the fetus begins to receive the essence of stone to form its skin and hair, and all six fu-organs and hundred joints are fully developed. Drink sweet wine and eat sweet foods, loosen the sash and maintain composure while awaiting birth—this is called "nurturing the hair and enhancing vitality."

In the ninth month, the Foot Shaoyin channel nourishes the fetus, and one must not needle or cauterize this meridian. The Foot Shaoyin internally connects to the kidneys, which govern the sinews. At nine months, the child’s sinews are fully formed. Avoid damp and cold environments, and do not wear scorching-hot clothing.

In the ninth month of pregnancy, if suddenly afflicted with diarrhea, abdominal fullness and tension, the fetus pressing upward against the heart, lumbar and back pain with inability to turn, and shortness of breath, use Pinellia Decoction:

**Pinellia Decoction**
Pinellia, ophiopogon, evodia, tangkuei, and ass-hide glue (each three liang), dried ginger (one liang), and twelve jujubes.
These seven ingredients are simmered in nine sheng of water, reducing to three sheng; the dregs are strained, and eight ge of white honey are added, gently warmed over a low flame. Divide into four doses; the diarrhea will cease. An alternate method uses a black hen to make broth for decocting the herbs.

**Pork Kidney Decoction**
For those who have previously injured the fetus in the ninth month, this formula should be taken preventatively:
One pork kidney, poria, mistletoe, dried ginger, dried rehmannia, chuanxiong (each three liang), atractylodes (four liang), a medium-sized aconite (one piece), three ge of soybeans, and one sheng of ophiopogon.
These ten ingredients are prepared by boiling the kidney in one dou of water until cooked, then removing the kidney and adding the remaining herbs, simmering to reduce to three and a half sheng. Divide into four doses, taken three times during the day and once at night, with one dose every ten days.

In the tenth month of pregnancy, the five zang-organs are complete, the six fu-organs fully connected, and the qi of Heaven and Earth are received into the cinnabar field. Thus, the joints and human spirits are all prepared, awaiting only the proper time for birth.

In the first month of pregnancy, the embryo begins; in the second, it becomes a soft mass; in the third, the placenta forms; in the fourth, the body takes shape; in the fifth, movement begins; in the sixth, the sinews and bones develop; in the seventh, hair grows; in the eighth, the zang-fu organs are complete; in the ninth, grain qi enters the stomach; and in the tenth, all spirits are prepared—once the days are fulfilled, birth occurs.

One should take fetal-smoothing medicines, beginning in the month of delivery.

**Salvia Paste**
To nourish the fetus and ease delivery when taken near the due date:
Salvia (half a jin), chuanxiong, and tangkuei (each two liang), and Sichuan pepper (five ge; if there is heat, substitute five ge of hemp seeds).
These four ingredients are moistened with clear wine and left overnight, then simmered in four sheng of rendered lard over a low flame until the paste turns blood-red. Strain through new cloth, discarding the dregs. Take a portion the size of a jujube daily, mixed into wine. Do not take prematurely—only at the due date. This method has long been proven effective.

**Licorice Powder**
To facilitate an easy birth, ensure the mother remains free of illness, and allow her to continue walking and moving as usual even after thirty days of taking it before delivery. The child will be born without the mother’s awareness:
Licorice (one liang), scutellaria (or poria), dried ginger, evodia, soybean sprouts, hemp seeds, cinnamon bark, and barley sprouts (or polished rice, each three liang).
Grind these eight ingredients into a fine powder. Take one square-inch spoonful with wine, three times daily. It may also be taken with warm water.

**Thousand Gold Pill**
To nourish the fetus and treat difficult births with malposition, retained placenta, postpartum disorders, absence of sweating, unceasing vexation and fullness, and qi counterflow with distension. Take one pill with wine. Also called "Life-Preserving Pill."
Licorice, fritillaria, Sichuan pepper, soybean sprouts, dried ginger, cinnamon bark, scutellaria, polished rice (or glutinous rice), dendrobium, gypsum (each six zhu), tangkuei (twelve zhu), and hemp seeds (three ge).
Grind these twelve ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a bullet. Take one pill three times daily with jujube decoction. An alternate method adds one liang of cattail pollen.

**Steamed Rhubarb Pill**
To nourish the fetus during pregnancy and facilitate an easy delivery:
Steamed rhubarb (thirty zhu), unripe bitter orange, chuanxiong, atractylodes, apricot kernels (each eighteen zhu), peony, dried ginger, magnolia bark (each twelve zhu), and evodia (one liang).
Grind these nine ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take two pills with wine on an empty stomach, three times daily, increasing the dose gradually if no effect is observed.

**Fetal-Smoothing Formula for Easy Delivery**
Ass-hide glue (eight liang), talc (two liang), and plantago seeds (one sheng).

Sift the three ingredients above. Take one square-inch spoonful with water, twice daily. Begin administration only in the month of childbirth. The medicine facilitates the nine orifices; do not take it prematurely.

**Another Prescription**
Burn mallow roots and stems to ash, and take one square *cun* spoonful with wine, thrice daily.

**Crab Claw Decoction**
For treating pregnancy where the woman has collapsed and lost stability, with fetal movement surging upward to assail the heart—severe cases may involve blood issuing from the mouth, labored breathing, or sudden flooding of one *dou* and five *sheng* of blood below, the fetus failing to descend. If the child has died, the abdomen grows cold; pressing the belly elicits urgent sensations akin to labor. The mother may be weakened, short of breath, and near death, restless and agitated, unable to find ease. Even after taking the medicine, she may not immediately recover, though the bleeding will cease. For those about to give birth, delivery follows swiftly. The prescription:

One *sheng* of crab claws
Two *chi* each of licorice and cinnamon bark
Two *liang* of ass-hide glue

Grind the four ingredients, then boil in one *dou* of east-flowing water until reduced to three *sheng*. Strain, add the glue, and heat until fully dissolved. Taking the entire dose at once is ideal; if unable, take a second dose after the time it takes to eat a meal. If the mouth is too tense to drink, force-feed the decoction—once swallowed, she will revive, and both mother and child will survive. If the fetus has already died, only the mother will live.

For cases without collapse, where the pregnancy is stable but bleeding occurs, this decoction will halt the flow. Some claim cinnamon unsettles the fetus, though this is not necessarily so.

**Fifth Discourse on Difficult Childbirth: Principles and Methods**

It is said: Though a woman in labor is considered unclean, during the moment of impending pain, as well as before and after delivery, no one from a household afflicted by death or impurity may come to see her, or the birth will be difficult. If she has already given birth, the child will be harmed.

For a woman giving birth or nursing, avoid the *fanzhi* month. If delivery occurs in this month, place her on cowhide or ashes, ensuring no water, blood, or foul matter touches the ground, or it will kill someone. Likewise, water used to wash clothing must be contained in a vessel. Cease these precautions only after the taboo month has passed.

If childbirth does not follow the birth chart and transgressions occur, both mother and child may die. Even if death does not result, both will fall ill, and nothing will go as desired. If the chart is followed without transgression, the mother will remain healthy, and the child will be easy to raise.

When labor begins, strictly avoid crowds observing; only two or three attendants should remain nearby. Once delivery is complete, others may be informed. If many people watch, the birth will invariably be difficult.

Above all, the mother must not panic or act hastily. Attendants must remain calm and deliberate, avoiding both premature relaxation and undue urgency, for anxiety leads to difficult labor. If abdominal pain arises and sparks appear before her eyes, the child is turning—delivery is not yet imminent.

Once the child is born, no one, including the mother, may ask whether it is a boy or girl. As soon as the infant touches the ground, give it five sips of freshly drawn well water. Avoid warm broths or foods, and do not let the mother see the filth.

For postpartum women, be cautious with hot medicines and hot wheat-based foods. Always remember: food and drink should be as warm as human skin. When labor is imminent, first remove her usual clothing and hang it over the stove and stove mouth, ensuring complete coverage—this eases delivery.

For difficult births, stillborn infants, breech presentations, retained placenta, or prolonged labor where the child clings to the spine, blood and qi surge upward to the heart, the mother’s complexion fades, and her breath weakens—consult the relevant prescriptions in these chapters.

**On Deficiency and Debilitation in Women (First Discourse) – With Supplementary Remarks on Night Sweats**

It is said: For women, not only the moment of childbirth demands concern—after delivery, great caution must be exercised, for here lies the utmost peril. Do not assume that because the birth passed without incident, one may indulge without restraint, transgressing all bounds. A transgression, however slight as an autumn hair, may invite illness as vast as Mount Song or Mount Tai. Why? Because postpartum ailments are more difficult to treat than other diseases.

After childbirth, a woman’s five viscera are depleted and weakened; only tonification is permissible, never purgation. If illness arises, do not hastily administer [missing character] medicine. Should [missing character] medicine be taken, it will further deplete her, deepening the deficiency and distancing her from recovery. Thus, for the first hundred days postpartum, she must be diligent and vigilant, avoiding reckless transgressions and immediate resumption of conjugal relations. If she violates this, her body may stiffen and arch backward like a drawn bow—this is called *ru feng* (puerperal wind), a sign of transgression. Should her body resemble a drawn bow, her life will flicker like a guttering candle. All women should reflect deeply on this. If, in a moment of carelessness, she trifles with her health and falls ill, she may suddenly collapse, with no one to appeal to. Even if she expends great wealth and seeks physicians far and wide, they may not understand this condition. Even if a physician arrives, her life may already be lost—where then can it be reclaimed? Those who study this art must master this principle thoroughly; it cannot be equated with ordinary remedies.

She must avoid using the privy for bowel movements; a chamber pot is preferable. Only after a full hundred days postpartum may conjugal relations resume. Otherwise, she will remain weak and emaciated until death, with a hundred diseases flourishing—beware of this. All women suffer from wind-qi and deficiency-cold below the navel, invariably due to premature resumption of relations.

Within seven days postpartum, while lochia persists, no decoctions should be taken, except when the mass below the navel disperses—then sheep’s meat broth may be administered. If pain is severe, this does not apply. After two or three days of observation, *Zelan* pills may be taken. By the end of the month, it is best to have finished the pills; otherwise, deficiency and debilitation may never fully recover. For those who are utterly emaciated and beyond remedy, *Wushi Zelan* pills may be taken.

During confinement, *Zelan* pills must be taken for tonification, but they should not be administered before seven days postpartum. If a woman gives birth during the summer months and seeks excessive coolness, she may contract wind-cold, leading to abdominal accumulations and a hundred diseases that persist into old age, defying all treatment. *Taoren* decoction governs this; it should be taken after confinement.

Even if a woman is free of illness, she should take one or two doses each autumn and winter, continuing throughout the year for optimal benefit.

Place in a long-necked porcelain jar, seal tightly with dough, and steam in a water bath for a full day and night without interrupting the fire. Ensure the jar’s mouth remains above the water, never submerged. When done, remove. Take one *ge* with warm wine, twice daily. Even men may take this.

Then add 3 *jin* of malt sugar and 3 *sheng* of white honey, blending well. Continue simmering in a copper vessel over a cauldron, stirring constantly with fresh bamboo to prevent sticking, until the mixture is well incorporated. When done, take a pill the size of a bullet with wine before meals, three times daily. If ineffective, gradually increase to two pills.

**Dihuang Yangzhi Decoction**
Governs postpartum emaciation, promoting plumpness, fairness, and balanced digestion:
- Fresh rehmannia juice, 1 *dou*

First simmer the rehmannia juice until reduced to 5 *sheng*, then add mutton fat and simmer until halved. Add ginger juice and simmer again until reduced, then combine with honey. Simmer in a copper vessel until it reaches the consistency of malt sugar. Take a portion the size of a chicken egg with hot wine, three times daily.

**Dihuang Wine**
Governs a hundred postpartum ailments. One month before delivery, it should be brewed in advance and taken during confinement:
- Fresh rehmannia juice, 1 *sheng*
- Fine yeast, 2 *sheng*
- Fine rice, 2 *sheng*

First soak the yeast in rehmannia juice to initiate fermentation, then brew according to household methods until fully fermented. Seal for seven days, then take the clear liquid. Ensure the wine’s influence is continuous, never interrupted. Avoid garlic, raw and cold foods, vinegar, slippery foods, pork, chicken, and fish—all women must abstain from these. However, during the hot summer months, it should not be prepared; it may be brewed and taken in spring, autumn, and winter.

**Formulas for Infants and Young Children, Part One**

**Preface to the First Section**

It is said: Among the principles of human life, none is more vital than nurturing the young. Without the small, the great cannot be achieved. Thus, the *Book of Changes* speaks of "accumulating the small to form the great," the *Book of Songs* recounts "the first birth of the people," and the *Commentaries* state that "Shengzi begot Duke Yin." This same principle—proceeding from the subtle to the manifest, from youth to maturity—is evident to all, requiring no appeal to classics or histories.

Therefore, in these formulas, we first address women and children, then men and the elderly, for this is the proper order of honoring the root. Yet infants, their *qi* and strength so delicate, present a challenge to physicians who would devote themselves to their care. Most scholars today pay them little heed, for babies lie swaddled in their cradles, their breath rank and restless, while physicians, proud in their skill, disdain to attend them. Reflecting on this, one can only sigh in lament.

The *Xiaopin Fang* states: From six years of age onward, one is called "small"; from sixteen onward, "young" (the *Chao Yuan* and *Waitai* texts read "eighteen onward" as "young"). From thirty onward, one is "strong" (the *Chao Yuan* and *Waitai* read "twenty onward" as "strong"). From fifty onward, one is "old." For those under six, the classics offer no guidance, and so illnesses in nursing infants are difficult to treat, for there is no foundation to rely upon.

In ancient times, there was a certain *Wu Fang* (the *Chao Yuan* reads *Wu Fang* as *Wu Mang*), who composed the *Luxiong Jing* on infants’ fontanelles, using it to divine longevity, diagnose illness, and predict life or death. Passed down through generations, this marked the beginning of pediatric formulas. By the Jin and Song dynasties, the southern lands esteemed the schools of the Su families, whose proven methods spread among the people. In the Qi dynasty, there was a certain Prince Xu, who compiled a *Formulary for Children* in three scrolls, and thus later scholars gained some access to transmission. Yet Prince Xu’s rank and renown were so exalted—how could he have found time to attend to the young? Examining his formulas, one finds them neither profound nor meticulous, with little worth adopting and nothing truly arcane.

Here, I have broadly gathered the effective methods from various schools, as well as those I have personally tested, to compose this section. Every household should master these arts of nurturing the young, that they may avoid the misfortune of untimely death.

It is further said: The illnesses of children differ little from those of adults; only the dosage of medicine varies. The conditions of fright epilepsy, *kewu* (visitation by malevolent spirits), *jielu* (unclosed fontanelle), and failure to walk—along with eight or nine other topics—are compiled in this volume. Formulas for conditions such as diarrhea are scattered throughout the other sections and may be consulted as needed.

In general: Sixty days after birth, the pupils form, and the child can laugh and respond to others. By one hundred days, the *ren* vessel is complete, and the child can roll over on its own.

One version states it occurs at one hundred fifty days. At one hundred eighty days, the coccyx forms, and the child can sit unsupported. At two hundred ten days, the metacarpals form, and the child can crawl. At three hundred days, the kneecaps form, and the child can stand alone. At three hundred sixty days, the knee bones form, and the child can walk. These are the established norms; if a child cannot meet these milestones, there must be some imbalance.

In general: A child undergoes its first *bian* (transformation) at thirty-two days after birth, and a second *bian* at sixty-four days, at which point *bian* is accompanied by *zheng* (steaming). At ninety-six days, the third *bian*; at one hundred twenty-eight days, the fourth *bian*, again accompanied by *zheng*. At one hundred sixty days, the fifth *bian*; at one hundred ninety-two days, the sixth *bian*, with *zheng*. At two hundred twenty-four days, the seventh *bian*; at two hundred fifty-six days, the eighth *bian*, with *zheng*. At two hundred eighty-eight days, the ninth *bian*; at three hundred twenty days, the tenth *bian*, with *zheng*. After the accumulation of three hundred twenty days, the minor *zheng* concludes. Sixty-four days later, the first major *zheng* occurs; another sixty-four days later, the second major *zheng*; and one hundred twenty-eight days after that, the third major *zheng*. In all, from birth, a child undergoes one *bian* every thirty-two days, with every second *bian* accompanied by a *zheng*. Ten *bian* result in five minor *zheng*, and three major *zheng* follow, totaling five hundred seventy-six days, after which all major and minor *zheng* conclude, and the child becomes fully formed.

The purpose of *bian* and *zheng* is to nourish the blood vessels and transform the five viscera. Thus, after each *bian* concludes, one can observe changes in the child’s temperament and disposition. During *bian* and *zheng*, the signs are as follows: *bian* manifests as rising qi, while *zheng* manifests as bodily heat. The severity of *bian* and *zheng* varies. In mild cases, the child has a slight fever and mild fright, with cold ears and coccyx, white blisters appearing on the upper lip like fish eyes, and slight sweating. In severe cases, the child has a strong fever with disordered pulse, either sweating or not, refuses food, vomits when fed, and the whites of the eyes may appear slightly red while the pupils may seem faintly white. It is also said: if the whites of the eyes are prominent, the condition is severe; if the red and black parts are affected, it is mild. After *bian* and *zheng* conclude, the eyes become clear again. These are the symptoms. A *bian* alone is mild, while *bian* combined with *zheng* is slightly more severe.

In normal cases, *zheng* subsides after five days; in prolonged cases, it may take up to ten days. The five days before and after the expected day—ten days in total—are when the fever dissipates. If a child undergoes its first *bian* at thirty-two days but develops a fever twenty-nine days early, treat it according to the proper method, and the *zheng* will conclude by thirty-six or thirty-seven days. To ensure clarity, this is reiterated.

During *bian* and *zheng*, avoid startling the child or allowing too many people near. The timing of *bian* and *zheng* may vary, and many children do not follow the expected pattern. If, during the initial *bian*, the fever is severe and does not abate after the expected number of days, carefully calculate the *bian* and *zheng* schedule. If the child has a slight fever and mild fright at the appropriate time, do not treat it with moxibustion or acupuncture; simply observe and harmonize. If the fever persists for a long time, administer a small dose of *Zi Wan* (Purple Pill) to induce a mild purgation, stopping once the fever subsides.

If, during *bian* and *zheng*, the child contracts a seasonal warm disease, or if such a disease occurs outside the *bian* and *zheng* period, the symptoms may appear similar. However, in such cases, the ears and coccyx will be uniformly hot, and no white blisters will appear on the lips. First administer *Hei San* (Black Powder) to induce sweating; after sweating, apply warm powder, and the fever should subside, leading to recovery. If the condition does not fully resolve, then administer *Zi Wan* to induce purgation.

If, during *bian* and *zheng*, the child is affected by cold, cold and heat will contend, causing twisting pain in the abdomen and waist, and incessant crying. In such cases, apply a warm compress to resolve it. The method for the warm compress is provided in the following section; it involves moxibustion, powder, and tight binding.

*Bian* and *zheng* resemble seasonal febrile illnesses and cold damage. If the condition is not *bian* and *zheng*, the body, ears, and coccyx will all be hot; this indicates another illness and should be treated accordingly. If it is indeed *bian* and *zheng*, do not treat it as another illness.

Another method states: A child begins its first *bian* at thirty-two days after birth, marked by bodily heat. At sixty-four days, the second *bian* occurs, accompanied by *zheng*, and the child’s appearance becomes well-proportioned. At ninety-six days, the third *bian* occurs, and the condition is confirmed by the emergence of sweat from the pores. At one hundred twenty-eight days, the fourth *bian* occurs, accompanied by *zheng*, and the child can laugh and respond. At one hundred sixty days, the fifth *bian* occurs, completing the joints and mechanisms. At one hundred ninety-two days, the sixth *bian* occurs, accompanied by *zheng*, and the five mechanisms are fully formed. At two hundred twenty-four days, the seventh *bian* occurs, and the child can crawl. At two hundred fifty-six days, the eighth *bian* occurs, accompanied by *zheng*, and the child begins to learn speech. At two hundred eighty-eight days, the ninth *bian* occurs, and the child stands upright.

From birth to two hundred eighty-eight days, a child undergoes nine *bian* and four *zheng*. On the day of *bian*, take care not to treat the child indiscriminately, as this may exacerbate the condition. *Bian* accompanied by *zheng* marks the child’s transition between months. *Zheng* is characterized by intense heat, disordered pulse, and sweating; it typically subsides in five days, or up to eight or nine days in prolonged cases. During *zheng*, do not apply moxibustion, acupuncture, or indiscriminate treatments.

**Purple Pill (*Zi Yuan*)**
For treating *bian* and *zheng* in children with persistent fever, as well as concurrent cold damage, seasonal febrile illnesses, fever persisting after sweating, phlegm accumulation in the abdomen, refusal to nurse, vomiting after feeding, and food epilepsy. The formula is as follows:

- *Chi Shi Zhi* (Halloysite) – 1 *liang*
- *Dai Zhe* (Hematite) – 1 *liang*
- *Ba Dou* (Croton seed) – 30 pieces
- *Xing Ren* (Apricot kernel) – 50 pieces

Grind the four ingredients into powder. Separately grind *Ba Dou* and *Xing Ren* into a paste, then combine and pound two thousand times until well-mixed. If the mixture is too hard, add a small amount of honey and continue pounding. Store in a sealed container. For a thirty-day-old child, administer a pill the size of a hemp seed with a small amount of breast milk to aid swallowing. After the time it takes to eat a meal, give a little more breast milk, but not too much. By midday, the child should experience a mild purgation, and the fever will subside. If the fever does not fully resolve, administer another pill the following morning.

For a hundred-day-old child, administer a pill the size of a small bean, adjusting the dosage accordingly. In summer, when heat is prevalent and rashes are prone to erupt, administering one pill every twenty or thirty days is beneficial.

The *Purple Pill* treats all ailments and, though purgative, does not weaken the patient.

**Black Powder**, a formula for treating childhood *bianzheng* (febrile episodes of growth), concurrent seasonal warm diseases, or seasonal illnesses occurring outside *bianzheng* periods:

- *Ma Huang* (Ephedra) – ½ *liang*
- *Xing Ren* (Apricot kernel) – ½ *liang*
- *Da Huang* (Rhubarb) – 6 *zhu*

First grind *Ma Huang* and *Da Huang* into powder, then separately grind *Xing Ren* into a paste. Gradually incorporate the paste into the powder, pounding until well-mixed. Store in a sealed container.

For a one-month-old child, administer a dose the size of a small bean, mixed with breast milk. Hold the child to induce sweating; once sweat appears, dust with warm powder and avoid exposure to wind. For a hundred-day-old child, administer a dose the size of a jujube pit, adjusting according to the child’s size.

**Method for Selecting a Wet Nurse:**
The blood and *qi* of a wet nurse transform into breast milk. All emotions, whether good or bad, arise from her blood and *qi*. Thus, a wet nurse must be cautious with joy and anger.

While the ideal physical and complexional traits of a wet nurse are numerous and unattainable in full, she should at least be free of foul body odor, goiter, fistula, chronic cough, scabies, paralysis, white scalp ringworm, festering sores, sunken lips, deafness, nasal congestion, epilepsy, or similar ailments before nursing a child. A skilled physician can discern the origins of past illnesses by examining old moxibustion scars.

**Prescriptions for Infants and Young Children**
**Second Discourse: On the Immediate Care After Birth**

When a child is first born, one must first wrap a finger in silk and wipe away the green mucus and foul blood from the mouth and tongue—this is called the *jade crosspiece* (or *bridle*). If not swiftly wiped away, the moment the child cries, these impurities will enter the abdomen and give rise to a hundred ailments.

If the child does not cry upon delivery, pour warm water over it in a vessel, and it will soon wail. If the child still does not cry, this is due to exhaustion from a difficult birth. One may take the umbilical cord and gently press it toward the child’s body to guide qi into the abdomen, then exhale warm breath upon it up to a hundred times, and the cry will naturally come. Alternatively, one may lightly strike the child with a scallion stalk to induce crying.

Once born, the child should be lifted immediately. Delay risks internal cold, causing rumbling in the abdomen. First bathe the child, then sever the umbilical cord—not with a knife, but by having someone bite through it while shielding the child with a single layer of clothing. Afterward, exhale warm breath upon it seven times before binding the cord, leaving the remaining stump long enough to reach the child’s instep. If too short, it may cause internal cold, leading to chronic dysentery. If the cord is cut before bathing, water may enter the navel, resulting in abdominal pain.

After severing the cord, inspect the stump carefully, for it often contains worms. Remove them promptly, lest they enter the child’s abdomen and cause illness. The umbilical stump should be left six *cun* in length—too long harms the flesh, too short harms the organs. If not cut in time or if residual fluids remain, the warmth will gradually dissipate, generating cold and causing *umbilical wind*.

For a male child, wrap him in his father’s old clothes; for a female, use her mother’s old garments. Avoid new silk, as it is best to use worn fabrics. Do not dress the child too warmly, for excessive heat damages the skin, harms the blood and vessels, and may lead to sores and jaundice. Infants’ clothing, whether silk or cotton, must never be overly thick or hot—take great care in this.

When a child is first born, its flesh is not yet fully formed, so do not bundle it in warm clothes, for this will weaken the sinews and bones. Instead, allow it to be exposed to wind and sunlight at appropriate times. If it never encounters wind, its skin and flesh will become fragile, easily susceptible to harm. Always clothe the child in old cotton padding, never new.

On warm, windless days, let the mother carry the child to play in the sun. Frequent exposure to wind and sunlight will congeal the blood, strengthen the qi, and firm the muscles, enabling the child to endure cold and avoid illness. Keeping the child constantly sheltered in curtains and wrapped in heavy, warm clothing is like growing plants in the shade—they will be soft and brittle, unable to withstand wind or cold.

**Method for Binding the Umbilicus:**
Pound white silk until soft, cut it into a four-*cun* square, and layer it with new cotton half a *cun* thick. Combine these with cloth of equal size, adjusting the tightness—if too tight, it will cause the child to vomit milk.

Twenty days after birth, unwrap the navel to inspect it. If around ten days the child cries angrily as if irritated by something in its clothes, this may be due to the dried navel stump pricking its abdomen. Unbind it, change the wrapping, and reapply. When binding the navel, close the door and curtains, light a fire to warm the room, and do the same when changing the wrapping. Dust the area with warm powder—this is for winter’s cold. If the navel does not heal, apply powdered burnt crimson silk. If after a month the navel still oozes fluid, apply powdered toad ash three or four times daily.

If water or cold enters the navel, the child will suffer from twisting abdominal pain, high-pitched wailing, and a bluish-black complexion. This is due to water intrusion. Warm powdered cotton and apply it as a compress. If untreated, the navel may swell—treat according to severity. For severe swelling, apply moxibustion up to eighty or ninety cones. For mild cases where the navel is not greatly swollen but merely oozes fluid and the child cries intermittently, pound *dang gui* into powder, mix it with lead powder, and apply it. Warm cotton compresses should be applied daily until the condition improves, with the cessation of crying as the sign of recovery. If the child’s stool is green, this indicates cold, akin to water in the navel.

After bathing, severing the cord, and swaddling the child, do not immediately give cinnabar honey. Instead, prepare a licorice decoction: take a segment of licorice the length of a finger joint, crush it, and boil it in two *ge* of water until reduced to one *ge*. Soak a piece of silk in the liquid and let the child suck it. Continue until about one *xian* shell’s worth of liquid has entered the abdomen, at which point the child should vomit, expelling the foul fluids from its chest and heart. If vomiting occurs, no further medicine is needed. If not, wait a while and administer more if the child seems hungry or thirsty. If the child still does not vomit after the initial and subsequent doses, give the remaining decoction gradually until the full *ge* is consumed.

If the foul fluids are expelled through vomiting, the child’s spirit and intelligence will be clear and free of illness. If the full *ge* is consumed without vomiting, it means the child did not ingest foul blood, and licorice decoction should not be given again. Instead, administer cinnabar honey to calm the spirit and settle the hun and po.

In the first three days after birth, do not give too much cinnabar honey, for excess will chill the spleen and stomach, causing abdominal distension, susceptibility to *yin* convulsions, rapid breathing, and potentially fatal lockjaw. **Method for Administering Cinnabar Honey to Newborns:**
Take refined cinnabar the size of a soybean, mix it with one *xian* shell of red honey, and use a chopstick wrapped in silk to dip and let the child suck it. Administer three dips, ensuring the full soybean-sized portion is consumed over one day. Continue for three days, using a total of three soybean-sized portions. Exceeding this amount will harm the child.

After administering cinnabar honey, give *niu huang* (cow bezoar) in the same quantity. *Niu huang* benefits the liver and gallbladder, clears heat, stabilizes the spirit, stops fright, repels malign qi, and prevents a hundred childhood illnesses.

Three days after birth, the child’s intestines and stomach should be opened to aid digestion.

**Method for Feeding Thick Rice Gruel to Newborns:**
Grind rice into a thick liquid, matching the consistency of yogurt or cream. Feed the child a portion the size of a soybean, allowing them to swallow it repeatedly until three soybean-sized portions are consumed. Administer this three times a day. After seven days, breastfeeding may commence.

**Breastfeeding Schedule:**
- Ten days after birth: feed portions the size of a jujube pit.
- Twenty days: double the amount.
- Fifty days: portions the size of a marble.
- One hundred days: portions the size of a jujube.

If the mother’s milk is insufficient, adjust the amounts slightly as needed. Breastfeeding at thirty days ensures the child remains free of illness. Early feeding overwhelms the child’s digestive *qi*, leading to sores on the head, face, and body that recur repeatedly, weakening the child and making them difficult to raise. Even after thirty days, do not overfeed; if the child shows no appetite, do not force-feed, as undigested food will cause illness.

If the child refuses milk, phlegm accumulations are likely present in the abdomen. Administer the *Four-Ingredient Purple Pill* to induce a mild purgation, then regulate breastfeeding. After a few days, the child will recover. For mild fever or chills, the same method should be used—purgation is essential for healing.

**Breastfeeding Precautions:**
- Avoid overfeeding, as it causes vomiting. If vomiting occurs, the child has been fed too much; offer empty breast (without milk) to settle the stomach, up to four times a day.
- If the umbilical stump has not healed, overfeeding may allow wind to enter through the navel.
- In summer, do not feed hot milk, as it causes vomiting and reflux.
- In winter, do not feed cold milk, as it leads to coughing and dysentery.
- If the mother has recently engaged in sexual activity, breastfeeding will cause the child to become emaciated, disrupting the menstrual cycle.
- If the mother has a fever, breastfeeding will turn the child yellow and impair their appetite.
- If the mother is angry while breastfeeding, the child may become easily startled, develop hernial *qi*, or suffer from upper-body *qi* disorders and mania.
- If the mother has recently vomited or had diarrhea, breastfeeding will weaken the child.
- If the mother is intoxicated, breastfeeding will cause the child to develop fever and abdominal distension.

**General Feeding Practices:**
- For newborns within the first month, feeding pig’s milk is highly beneficial.
- When breastfeeding, the mother should first thoroughly massage her breasts to disperse heat and prevent milk from spurting out, which could choke the child. Remove the breast to allow the child to breathe, then resume feeding. Repeat this five to ten times, adjusting based on the child’s hunger and satiety to determine the daily feeding frequency.
- Always express and discard the first milk before feeding.
- If the child is lying down, the mother should support them with her arm, keeping the breast level with the child’s head to prevent choking.
- If the mother wishes to sleep, she should remove the breast from the child’s mouth to avoid blocking their nose and mouth, and to prevent overfeeding.

**Bathing the Child:**
- The water temperature must be carefully balanced—too hot or cold will startle the child and harm the five viscera.
- In winter, avoid prolonged bathing to prevent cold injury; in summer, avoid prolonged bathing to prevent heat injury.
- Frequent cold baths on the back may induce convulsions, while insufficient bathing may cause hair loss.
- For newborns, mix the juice of one pig’s gallbladder into the bathwater to prevent sores and scabies for life. Do not use other water.
- Three days after birth, bathe the child with *Peach Root Decoction*: use two *liang* each of peach, plum, and apricot roots (or branches), chop them, boil in three *dou* of water for twenty simmers, strain, and use the liquid for bathing. This dispels inauspicious influences and prevents sores and scabies for life.
- To treat childhood fright and repel malign *qi*, bathe the child with *Gold-Tiger Decoction*: boil one *jin* of gold and one tiger skull in three *dou* of water, using the decoction for bathing as needed.

**Treating Oral Conditions in Newborns:**
- **Thrush (Goose Mouth):** Some newborns have white, rice-like patches on the tongue, and in severe cases, inside the nostrils. This results from excessive *qi* from grains in the womb or the mother’s craving for glutinous rice during pregnancy. Treatment: Wrap hair around a finger, dip it in well water (drawn at dawn), and gently wipe the patches for three days. If unresolved, boil chestnut husks to make a thick juice, wrap silk around a chopstick, dip it in the juice, and wipe the patches. In spring or summer, if chestnut husks are unavailable, boil chestnut bark and use it as with well water.
- **Tongue-Tie:** Some newborns have a membrane beneath the tongue resembling the partition in a pomegranate seed, restricting speech. Use a fingernail to snip it; slight bleeding is harmless. If bleeding persists, burn hair into ash and apply it to stop the bleeding.
- Six or seven days after birth, the child’s blood and *qi* consolidate into flesh, clearing the mouth, tongue, throat, and cheeks. If there are water-filled blister-like growths in the throat or tongue, or swollen, abscess-like protrusions, wrap silk around a long needle, leaving only a millet-sized tip exposed. Pierce the growth to release *qi*, draining green, yellow, or red fluid. Perform one puncture and observe for a day; if unresolved, repeat the next day. No more than three punctures are needed for complete resolution. Minor cases may require only three punctures.
  - Growths under the tongue are called *double tongue*.
  - Growths in the cheeks or upper palate are called *double palate*.
  - Growths on the gums are called *double gums*.
  All should be treated by draining the fluid.

**Treating Stillborn Newborns:**
If the child appears stillborn, check for a blister-like growth on the upper palate near the uvula. Use a finger to rupture it and drain the blood, ensuring it does not enter the throat—this would be fatal. Act swiftly and with caution.

**Blood Stagnation in Newborns:**
At birth, the child’s bones and flesh are not yet consolidated, and their muscles are still composed of blood. Only when blood coagulates does it form firm flesh. If the blood stagnates and fails to consolidate, the child’s face, particularly around the nose and mouth, will turn yellow, and they will cry with closed eyes, pursed lips, and a wrinkled face. Their mouth will be dry, and their limbs will be unable to stretch or flex. These symptoms indicate unconsolidated blood vessels, often leading to failure to thrive.

If such symptoms manifest, administer the *Longdan Decoction*. The formula is found in the section on fright epilepsy below.

**Methods for Assessing a Child’s Lifespan:**
When a child is first born, a cry that is prolonged and unbroken portends longevity. A cry that ceases abruptly and then rises sharply in pitch foretells a short life. A cry that is scattered and unfocused indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. A cry that is deep and guttural indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. If the navel contains no blood, this is auspicious. A small navel foretells a short life. If the body is limp and soft as though boneless, the child will not live long. A child who is fair-skinned, tall, and large in build will live long. A child who opens their eyes on their own will not survive to adulthood. Eyes that gaze unsteadily or dart about frequently are a grave omen. A child who sweats blood will endure many hardships and not live long. A child whose sweat does not flow will not survive to adulthood. Urine that congeals like grease indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. A skull with four unfused sutures indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. Constantly moving the hands and feet indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. Early sitting, early walking, early teething, or early speech are all signs of a perverse nature and an inauspicious constitution. Hair that does not grow in a complete ring around the head indicates the child will not survive to adulthood. Sparse hair indicates stubbornness and disobedience—or, in another version, dullness. A whorl of hair on the forehead portends early prominence but may bring misfortune to the parents. If the occipital bone is not fully formed at birth, the child will learn to speak before dying. If the bones of the corpse (cervical vertebrae) are not fully formed, the child will learn to sit upright before dying. If the bones of the palm are not fully formed, the child will learn to crawl before dying. If the heel bones are not fully formed, the child will learn to walk before dying. If the kneecaps are not fully formed, the child will learn to stand before dying. A body that does not contract (after birth) will die. A mouth shaped like a fish’s indicates death. Thighs lacking flesh will die. A cleft beneath the chin indicates death. Genitals that do not become erect indicate death. A scrotum that appears white indicates death; if it appears red, it also indicates death. If the scrotal seam is fully formed and dark, this portends longevity.

**Discourse:**
For children aged three to ten, observing the nature and disposition of their *qi* allows one to discern the general outline of their lifespan. Children who are precociously intelligent and quick-witted often die young—such as Xiang Tuo or Yan Hui. Children whose bone structure is well-formed, whose demeanor is dignified, and whose movements are deliberate and unhurried—requiring patient refinement—will live long. Those who anticipate others’ intentions and move with swift agility will also die young, like Yang Xiu or Kong Rong. From these observations, the general outline of a child’s lifespan can be known. It is like the early-blooming plum, which does not endure the cold of winter, while the late-blooming chrysanthemum thrives into old age. Thus, late maturation is a sign of longevity.

**On Infantile Convulsions and Seizures (Third Discourse)**
*Diagnosis, Prescriptions, and Moxibustion*

**Discourse:**
The occurrence of convulsive and spasmodic disorders in infants and young children arises from disharmony in the visceral *qi*. Those afflicted at birth suffer from ungathered viscera, undispersed blood and *qi*, uncirculating five vessels, and fragile, unformed bones—most fail to thrive. For infants between one month and forty days up to one year of age, convulsions stem from improper nursing, disharmony of blood and *qi*, and invasion by wind evil.

When the illness begins with fever, convulsive twitching, startled crying, and subsequent seizures, a floating pulse indicates *yang* convulsions, affecting the six *fu*-organs and the exterior muscles and skin—these are relatively easy to treat. If the illness begins with cold limbs, no convulsions or crying, and a sunken pulse at onset, it is *yin* convulsions, affecting the five *zang*-organs and the interior bones and marrow—these are exceedingly difficult to cure.

Seizures with limpness and intermittent lucidity are termed *convulsions* (*xian*). Rigidity, backward arching like a bow, and prolonged unconsciousness are termed *spasms* (*jing*). In all cases of backward arching, if an adult’s hand fits beneath the spine or three fingers fit beneath a child’s, the condition is incurable.

A floating or sunken pulse merely distinguishes whether the illness lies in the *yin* or *yang*, exterior or interior. Beyond this, the pulse may also exhibit signs of excess or deficiency, slipperiness or roughness, repletion or vacuity, and other patterns—treatment must follow the pulse’s form.

*The Divine Farmer’s Classic of Materia Medica* states: "Infantile convulsions manifest in one hundred and twenty varieties, each with subtle deviations from the norm—any such sign is a harbinger of convulsions." Newborns, with ungathered blood vessels and unformed viscera, are vulnerable to illness from even slight mismanagement in care, often failing to mature. After the *bianzheng* (febrile growth phases), most conditions become less severe, though wind-stroke remains the most sudden and critical.

If a child’s limbs are weak, with convulsive twitching and slight respiratory irregularities, or if symptoms persist beyond the expected *bianzheng* days, *Longdan Decoction* is indicated.

Infantile convulsions fall into three types: wind convulsions, fright convulsions, and food convulsions. Wind and fright convulsions occur frequently, with scarcely one or two in ten cases attributable to wind or fright. All cases beginning with chills followed by fever are food convulsions.

Fright convulsions should be treated by moxibustion according to the diagrams; wind convulsions require *Pig’s Heart Decoction*; food convulsions necessitate purgation, with *Purple Pill* being most effective.

Wind convulsions arise when sweat from overheating allows wind to enter. Their onset is marked by finger-counting motions before seizures. Fright convulsions begin with terror, loud crying, and subsequent seizures. Mild fright convulsions may cease if the child is steadied and not further startled.

If the child first refuses milk, vomits, then develops fever before seizures, this is food convulsions—early purgation brings recovery. *Four-Ingredient Purple Pill* and *Zhupi Decoction* are most effective, swiftly eliminating illness without weakening the patient. *Red Pill* (though no original formula exists, and it is absent from other medical texts) should be used if *Four-Ingredient Purple Pill* fails to purge. For severe cases, the *Eight-Ingredient Purple Twin Pill* (listed later in the section on *Pi*-accumulation and abdominal distension), which includes cinnabar (appearing red), croton, and kansui, may serve as *Red Pill*—it is reserved for grave conditions.

Purple Pill should be administered to infants refusing milk. Newborns, with abundant vital *qi*, tolerate mild purgation without harm; timely purgation cures illness and brings profound benefit. Delay risks severe disease, which becomes difficult to treat.

*Purgation:* *Four-Ingredient Purple Pill* is optimal, purging without harm while eliminating illness. If it fails, use *Red Pill*; if *Red Pill* fails, double the dose. For residual heat after purgation, administer *Longdan Decoction* in small doses and apply *Red Ointment* via massage. (Formulas appear at the end of this section.)

Wind convulsions also require purgation, but with *Pig’s Heart Decoction*. Fright convulsions are treated by moxibustion per the diagrams and massage with *Raw Ointment* (formulas at the end). Avoid excessive purgation—why?

Fright convulsions may unsettle the heart’s *qi*—or, as another version has it, the feet’s *qi*—and purgation risks internal vacuity, only worsening the condition. Severe fright convulsions are particularly difficult to treat. Thus, in rearing infants, one must constantly guard against fright: let them hear no loud noises, and when holding them, do so gently to avoid startling them. During thunderstorms, stop their ears and create other soft sounds to distract them.

In raising infants, mild fright can stimulate their blood and vessels, but excessive fright requires moxibustion of the fright vessels. If moxibustion is performed at fifty or sixty days, the fright may worsen; only after one hundred days is moxibustion of the fright vessels beneficial.

When an infant has heat, refuses milk, sleeps restlessly, and startles frequently, these are the early signs of convulsions. Administer *Purple Pill* to cure it; if it fails, repeat the dose. If the infant startles slightly during sleep, once a month administer *Purple Pill* to reduce excess *qi* and prevent convulsions.

For illnesses arising after the Beginning of Summer, avoid indiscriminate moxibustion or purgation; instead, bathe the infant in *Heat-Removing Decoction*, dust with *Heat-Removing Powder*, and massage with *Red Ointment* for Heat Removal. Apply the ointment to the navel, keep the infant in a cool place, and do not restrict water or fluids—frequently offer fresh water to drink.

If an infant’s clothing is too thin, milk and food in the abdomen will fail to digest, leading to sour-smelling stools—a sign of impending *pi* accumulation. Administer *Purple Pill* in small doses to gently resolve it. Begin with a minimal amount, ensuring the stool remains loose but not excessively purged. Once the stool loosens, gradually reduce the dose, discontinuing when the sour odor ceases.

In winter, purgation is unproblematic, but in summer, recovery is slower. Nevertheless, if illness is present, purgation is necessary. After purgation, the abdomen may feel slightly distended, so regulate milk intake for several days and avoid indiscriminate purgation.

When feeding an infant, maintain a consistent quantity; as the child grows, gradually increase it. If the amount decreases, the abdomen may be slightly unregulated—administer a small dose of medicine and temporarily withhold solid food, offering only milk. In severe cases, this may last ten days; in mild cases, five or six, after which feeding can resume as usual. If the infant refuses solid food entirely and only desires milk, this indicates *pi* accumulation—a critical condition requiring purgation. Failure to purge may lead to alternating chills and fever, vomiting, convulsions, or dysentery, all of which are severe and difficult to treat if not addressed early. Treat the condition while it is still mild to avoid weakening the infant and ensure swift recovery.

When an infant’s stool is yellow and foul, latent heat is present in the abdomen—administer *Longdan Decoction* in small doses. If the stool is white and sour, this indicates lingering cold and indigestion—administer *Purple Pill*. For mild cases, give a small dose to resolve it internally; for severe cases, slightly increase the dose to induce mild purgation. In all cases, regulate milk intake for several days to harmonize stomach *qi*. Without such regulation, the illness may recur, and repeated purgation will injure stomach *qi*, causing abdominal distension. Two or three purgations may be tolerable, but further repetition will cause harm.

If an infant has *pi* accumulation and a large pulse, convulsions will inevitably follow—this is food-induced convulsions, curable by purgation. Carefully monitor the pulse in the palm and the three fingers; do not allow it to rise. Failure to purge in time may lead to convulsions, which then become difficult to treat. Early purgation prevents the pulse from rising. If the pulse is still in the palm, early treatment is possible; once it reaches the fingers, the condition worsens.

When illness arises in an infant’s abdomen, the body alternates between chills and fever. This movement agitates the blood and vessels, unsettling the heart and making the infant prone to fright, which rapidly triggers convulsions.

**Method for Detecting Convulsions:**
Convulsions are a grave illness in infants, sometimes leading to distress before a physician can be summoned. Since the *qi* arises internally, there are always early signs. Carefully observe the infant’s spirit and note the following indicators:

- If the thenar eminence (the fleshy part of the palm near the thumb) appears dark, this is a sign of convulsions.
- A red thenar pulse indicates heat; a large, green pulse indicates cold; a fine, green pulse is normal.
- Dry nose and mouth, difficulty with urination or defecation—signs of convulsions.
- Dull eyes, upward gaze, preference for sunlight—signs of convulsions.
- Prominent green vessels above the mastoid process behind the ear, restless sleep—signs of convulsions. Prick the green vessels to release blood.
- The infant arches backward while crying, with dark facial expression but no color change—signs of convulsions.
- Greenish nose and mouth, frequent mild startling—signs of convulsions.
- Closed eyes with greenish hue, frequent mild startling—signs of convulsions.
- Body heat with constant head sweating—signs of convulsions.
- Body heat with vomiting, hiccups, and panting—signs of convulsions.
- Body heat with fixed upward gaze—signs of convulsions.
- Frequent yawning with upward gaze—signs of convulsions.
- Body heat with unfocused gaze—signs of convulsions.
- Sudden dilation of the pupils, darker than usual—signs of convulsions.
- Restless sleep with startling, trembling hands and feet—signs of convulsions.
- Sleeping with laughter, shaking hands and feet—signs of convulsions.
- Irritable mood with sudden anger—signs of convulsions.
- Difficulty swallowing milk—signs of convulsions.
- Body heat with difficult urination—signs of convulsions.
- Unceasing vomiting and diarrhea with intermittent pain—signs of convulsions.
- Playing with the tongue and shaking the head—signs of convulsions.

The above twenty-odd signs are all early indicators of convulsions. Upon observing them, press firmly on the yang pulse corresponding to the moxibustion points, causing the infant to cry out sharply. Also, follow the prescribed method for the "cut-off" vessels in the feet and administer the appropriate decoction.

Fixed gaze with moving pupils, abdominal fullness with gurgling, bloody stool, body heat, lockjaw preventing milk intake, arched back, sweating with fever, unconsciousness, convulsive jerking of hands and feet, and frequent startling—these eight signs indicate the most severe stage of convulsions.

If these signs appear, they can no longer be remedied by decoctions or nail-pressure; moxibustion must be applied immediately.

It is stated: If the patient’s family seeks treatment at the very onset of illness, the physician may examine the symptoms, determine the proper method, and proceed in an orderly manner to achieve a cure from beginning to end. If, however, the patient’s family has already undergone disordered and indiscriminate treatment, failing to control the illness, the condition will deviate from its original presentation. When a subsequent physician then examines the patient, unaware of the earlier signs of deficiency or excess, and treats solely based on the later symptoms, the illness will not be cured. It is essential to inquire meticulously and observe carefully, following the previous physician’s prescriptions and tracing the earlier course of the illness to guide treatment—only then can errors be avoided.

If the previous physician prescribed a decoction meant to require several doses for a cure, but the patient’s family, after taking only one or two doses without effect, declares it ineffective and consults another physician—who, without investigating the prior treatment’s sequence of warming and cooling, prescribes anew without regard for the earlier physician’s approach—such treatment will fail. For instance, if purging was previously applied, subsequent treatment should employ mild and harmonizing therapies to follow it, thereby achieving a cure. If purging was not previously used, or if the illness was not resolved, or if the prior treatment’s warming and cooling were imbalanced, the subsequent physician must adjust and correct it. This is how to remedy a failed treatment. All such cases require careful assessment before proceeding to avoid further harm. Disregarding proper sequence and failing to examine thoroughly will inevitably lead to grave consequences.

**Gentian Decoction** treats infants immediately after birth whose blood and vessels are replete and robust, manifesting alternating chills and fever, vigorous heat, convulsive jerking of the limbs, fever, and severe vomiting with retching. If the infant is already able to take food but suffers from undigested accumulations, persistent high fever, unresolved *bianzheng* (febrile episodes of growth), invasion by malevolent *qi* or ghostly influences, or all types of fright and convulsions, this formula governs them all. Children under ten years of age may all take it. This is the primary Gentian Decoction for newborn infants. For older infants and children, follow this as a model.

If the nature of the invading *qi* or the presence of *ji* (demonic) influences is certain, add *ginseng* and *Chinese angelica*, each in an amount equal to the gentian. For a one-hundred-day-old infant, add three *zhū*; for a two-hundred-day-old infant, add six *zhū*; for a one-year-old child, add half a *liǎng*. The remaining ingredients follow accordingly.

**Ingredients:**
Gentian, *uncaria stem bark*, *bupleurum*, *scutellaria*, *platycodon*, *peony*, *poria* (or *polygala root*), *licorice*—each six *zhū*; *dung beetle*—two specimens; *rhubarb*—one *liǎng*.

Grind the ten ingredients, then decoct in one *shēng* of water until reduced to five *gé* to form the dose. Administer according to the following guidelines.

The potency of the medicine varies; for a weaker preparation, use the full measured amount of water. For an infant one to seven days old, divide one *gé* into three doses. For an infant eight to fifteen days old, divide one and a half *gé* into three doses. For an infant sixteen to twenty days old, divide two *gé* into three doses. For an infant twenty-one to thirty days old, divide three *gé* into three doses. For an infant thirty-one to forty days old, use the full five *gé* divided into three doses. In all cases, discontinue once purging occurs; do not administer a second dose.

Grind the ingredients, then decoct in one *jīn* of water-free lard to form an ointment. Decoct the ingredients over low heat, adjusting consistency until thick, then strain. Take a piece the size of a pellet, warm in the hands, and massage the child one hundred times. For cold, apply heat; for heat, apply coolness.

Even when infants show no illness, routinely apply ointment at dawn to massage the fontanel and the centers of the palms and soles—this effectively wards off cold and wind.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
It is advised that for newborns without illness, one must never prematurely apply acupuncture or moxibustion. If performed prematurely, the pain disrupts the five vessels, often leading to convulsive disorders. In the cold lands of Heluo and Guanzhong, infants are prone to convulsions. Many there perform preventive moxibustion on the third day after birth, and also moxa the cheeks to prevent lockjaw. Those with lockjaw exhibit tension in the vessels beneath the tongue and spasms in the jaw muscles. Due to the cold climate, blood is commonly let from beneath the tongue, and the cheeks are moxaed to prevent lockjaw. In the warmer regions of Wu and Shu, this illness does not occur. Though ancient formulas have been transmitted, people today fail to distinguish between northern and southern differences, blindly following the methods—thus often harming infants. Rural children, left to nature, generally avoid such premature deaths.

For infants with fright-induced crying, twitching limbs during sleep, or unresolved *bianzheng* (febrile convulsions), avoid acupuncture, moxibustion, or nail-pressing, as these disturb the hundred vessels and may induce convulsions. Only for yin convulsions, lockjaw, or spasms may acupuncture, moxibustion, or nail-pressing be applied.

When moxaing convulsions, first purge the child to induce emptiness, then moxa to address the deficiency. Moxaing without prior purging when there is repletion forces qi to stagnate, blocking front and back—this can be fatal.

Convulsions occurring at dawn arise in the Foot *Shaoyang*; at early morning, in the Foot *Jueyin*; at midday, in the Foot *Taiyang*; at dusk, in the Foot *Taiyin*; at nightfall, in the Foot *Yangming*; and at midnight, in the Foot *Shaoyin*. The location of the convulsive disorder corresponds to the time of onset—moxa accordingly.

Convulsions may involve the five viscera, the six livestock, the four limbs, or the abdomen. Carefully examine the signs and moxa the affected area—even mild cases will resolve. Misapplying the method, however, brings harm.

**Liver Convulsions:** The face turns green, the eyes roll back, and the hands and feet tremble. Moxa the Foot *Shaoyang* and *Jueyin*, three cones each.

**Heart Convulsions:** The face reddens, heat accumulates below the heart, breathing is short and rapid. Moxa the point two ribs below the heart, at the center of the depression—this is *Juque*. Also moxa the Hand *Jueyin* and *Shaoyin*, three cones each.

**Spleen Convulsions:** The face turns yellow, the abdomen swells, and diarrhea is common. Moxa *Weiguan* three cones, two cones beside it, and the Foot *Yangming* and *Taiyin*, two cones each.

**Lung Convulsions:** The face and eyes turn white, and froth appears at the mouth. Moxa the *Feishu* point three cones, and the Hand *Yangming* and *Taiyin*, two cones each.

**Kidney Convulsions:** The face turns black, the eyes stare fixedly forward without movement, like a corpse. Moxa two *cun* and two *fen* below the heart, three cones, and the pulsating vessel at the elbow, two cones each. Also moxa the Foot *Taiyang* and *Shaoyin*, two cones each.

**Diaphragm Convulsions:** The eyes roll back, and the four limbs cannot be lifted. Moxa *Fengfu*, the top of the head, the philtrum, and *Chengjiang* beneath the lower lip—each according to the child’s age in cones.

**Intestinal Convulsions:** The body does not tremble. Moxa both *Chengshan* points, the centers of the soles, the *Laogong* points in the palms, and *Wangu* behind both ears—each according to the child’s age in cones. Also moxa the navel fifty cones.

**Six Livestock Convulsions:**

**Horse Convulsions:** The mouth gapes, the head shakes, the child neighs like a horse, and the body arches backward. Moxa *Fengfu* and the navel, three cones each. If the disorder is in the abdomen, burn and administer horse hoof powder—this is effective.

**Ox Convulsions:** The eyes stare fixedly forward, and the abdomen distends. Moxa *Jiuwei* and *Dazhui*, three cones each. Burn and administer ox hoof powder—this is effective.

**Sheep Convulsions:** The child frequently rolls the eyes and sticks out the tongue. Moxa above *Dazhui*, three cones.

**Pig Convulsions:** The child frequently froths at the mouth. Moxa one *cun* beside the *Wangu* bone, seven cones each side.

**Dog Convulsions:** The hands clench into fists. Moxa the center of both palms, one cone each; the Foot *Taiyang*, one cone; and *Gehu*, one cone.

**Chicken Convulsions:** The head shakes, the body arches backward, and the child startles easily, trembling. Moxa all yang channels of the feet, three cones each.

**Sudden Infantile Convulsions:** Moxa both nipples; for girls, moxa two *fen* below the nipples.

To treat sudden infantile convulsions where the body stiffens like a corpse and the abdomen rumbles like thunder, moxa *Taicang*, the navel, and one *cun* above, below, and to either side of the navel—six points in total. Also measure the distance from the neck to the navel with a string, then wrap it around the back along the spine to its end, and moxa one *cun* on either side, five cones each.

If the face is pale and the crying does not alter the complexion, moxa the Foot *Yangming* and *Taiyin*.

If the eyes roll upward and the pupils twitch, moxa the fontanel. The method for locating it: Measure the width of the mouth from corner to corner, then measure the width of the nose from side to side. Subtract half the nose’s width from the mouth’s width, and combine this with the mouth’s measurement. Starting from the hairline above the forehead, measure upward—moxa the point on the head where the bones have not yet fused, where movement is felt under the hand. This is the most critical point.

Next, moxa slightly above the hairline on the forehead, two *fen* in, directly aligned with the nose.

Then moxa both sides, two *fen* above the hairline, directly above the pupils.

Next, moxa the whorl of hair on the crown.

Then moxa *Kezhuren*, located at the pulsating vessel behind the brow.

Next, moxa both *Ermén*, where the bone separates when the mouth opens, revealing a depression.

Then moxa above both ears, folding the ear to find the point at its upper tip. Alternatively, for adults, place three fingers horizontally above the ear; for children, use their own fingers.

Finally, moxa the greenish vessels above *Wangu* behind both ears—these may also be pricked to let blood.

Next, moxa *Yuzhen*, located at the prominent bone at the back of the neck.

Then moxa both *Fengchi*, situated in the depressions at the outer edges of the hairline behind the neck, where the moving sinews lie.

Next, moxa *Fengfu*, at the central hairline of the nape, which may also be aligned horizontally with *Fengchi* at three points.

Then moxa the two corners of the head, where the bones rise beside the whorl of hair.

The head comprises nineteen points in total.

For infants ten days old, moxa three *zhuang*; for those thirty days old, five *zhuang*; for those fifty days old, seven *zhuang*. In severe cases, moxa all points; in mild cases, only moxa the fontanelle, *Fengchi*, and *Yuzhen*.

The moxa must be well-processed, the cone even and firmly placed against the skin, so the fire’s efficacy reaches the afflicted site. If the moxa is raw, the cone uneven and not flush with the skin, moxibustion with many cones will be futile.

If the abdomen is distended, breath is short, and rumbling occurs, moxa *Feimu*, located in the second intercostal space above both nipples, directly aligned with the pupils when measured with a suspended string.

Next, moxa *Shanzhong*.

Then moxa *Xiongtang*.

Next, moxa the navel.

Then moxa *Bixi*, located in the first intercostal space below both nipples.

Next, moxa *Juque*: in adults, one *cun* below *Jiuwei*; in children, divide the distance from the navel to *Jiuwei* into six parts, and moxa one *cun* below *Jiuwei*. Moxa both sides as well.

Next, moxa *Weiguan*.

Then moxa *Jinmen*, located at the midpoint between the anus and the scrotum, measured from the base of the scrotum to the large opening in front.

The abdomen comprises twelve points in total.

For *Xiongtang*, *Juque*, and *Weiguan*, moxa three *zhuang* for ten-day-old infants; five *zhuang* for those over one month. For the seam below the genitals, moxa three *zhuang*, or as many as the child’s age in years.

If the spine is rigid and arched backward, moxa *Dazhui*, as well as the transport points of all viscera and the midline of the governing vessel along the spine. Measure from *Dazhui* to the coccyx, then fold the measurement in half; moxa the point at the lower end of this measurement from *Dazhui*—this is the governing vessel.

The back comprises twelve points in total.

For ten-day-old infants, moxa three *zhuang*; for those over one month, five *zhuang*.

If the limbs convulse and the child is startled, moxa *Chize*, then *Yangming*, then *Shaoshang*, then *Laogong*, then *Xinzhu*, then *Hegu*, then *Sanjian*, then *Shaoyang*.

The hands comprise sixteen points in total.

The essential points are *Yangming*, *Shaoshang*, *Xinzhu*, *Chize*, *Hegu*, and *Shaoyang*; apply *zhuang* as above.

Next, moxa *Futu*, then *Zusanli*, then the calf, then *Luxi*, then *Yangming*, then *Shaoyang*, then *Rangu*.

The feet comprise fourteen points in total.

All are essential and may be moxaed; apply *zhuang* as above.

The *Yangming* channels of the hands and feet—meaning the four fingers—should be moxaed in all cases of infantile convulsions and epilepsy.

If wind affliction is severe and the limbs convulse, moxa the tips of all ten fingers and toes, as well as the points behind the knuckles.

**Formulas for Infants and Young Children**
**Section Four: Guest Affliction – Treatise, Formulas, Moxibustion, and Incantations**

The treatise states: The reason infants and young children suffer from *guest affliction* is due to the adverse influence of external persons’ *qi*. This is also called *striking a person* and is known as *guest affliction*.

Even household members from another room or separate quarters, including wet nurses, parents, or those returning from outside—if their clothing has been exposed to malevolent *qi* from ghosts, spirits, violent forces, or the *qi* of oxen or horses—may all cause *guest affliction*.

If one is panting or the *qi* of breast milk is unsettled, these too may result in *guest affliction*. When a wet nurse has consumed alcohol, engaged in sexual activity, or panted before nursing, the milk is most harmful and may even kill the child. This must not be taken lightly.

Whenever one rides a horse and is exposed to its sweaty, foul *qi*, and then approaches a child without washing or changing clothes, the child may be struck by *horse guest affliction*. If a child suddenly sees a horse approaching, is startled by its neigh, or comes into contact with items carrying the horse’s *qi*, they may also suffer from *horse guest affliction*. Special care must be taken to protect children, particularly those around one year of age.

In the clothing of young children—whether made of cloth, silk, or cotton—there must be no strands of hair, nor should there be any in their shoes. Wearing white clothes with a blue sash or blue clothes with a white sash may also invite *guest affliction*.

Unfamiliar persons or objects entering from outside can likewise frighten children and cause illness. To prevent this, whenever someone or something unusual enters the household, the child should be kept away and not allowed to see them. If this is unavoidable, burn ox dung to produce constant smoke at the doorway—this is effective.

Children afflicted by *guest* illnesses may fall ill at any time. However, when nearly all young children in early autumn become sick, is this truly because they have all been struck by *guest* evil? The reason children fall ill less in spring and winter but more in summer and autumn is that during summer and autumn, their *yang qi* is at the surface, and their blood and vessels are tender and weak. In early autumn and late summer, sudden cold may occur in the morning and evening. As children are delicate, their exterior is easily harmed; sudden cold restrains their *yang*, causing *yang* to congeal and generate heat, while cold in the stomach leads to diarrhea. Thus, in late summer and early autumn, older children often suffer from high fever and diarrhea—not necessarily due to *guest affliction* or *gui* spirits.

When treating young children, one should always observe the temperature in late summer and early autumn. If sudden cold or chill occurs, younger children are more likely to develop high fever and diarrhea. Be cautious not to purge first; always eliminate toxins before purging.

*The Record of the Mysterious Center* states: In the world, there is a female bird called *Gu Huo* (also known as *Wu Hu* in *Emergency Prescriptions* and *Secret Records of Mother and Child*), or *Heavenly Emperor’s Daughter*, *Hidden Flying Bird*, *Night-Wandering Woman*, or *Stellar Hook Demon*. It delights in flying and crying on rainy nights, lingering near villages. If it calls and someone responds, it is this bird. *Wu Chun* is a female without a male, incapable of reproduction; it is born from poisonous *yin qi*. It enjoys shedding feathers in human courtyards and placing them in children’s clothing, causing the child to develop epilepsy, which is invariably fatal. The bird then transforms into the child. Therefore, for children up to ten years old, clothing and bedding must not be left exposed, especially in the seventh and eighth months.

Generally, the symptoms of *guest affliction* include vomiting and diarrhea with green, yellow, or white substances, undigested food, severe abdominal pain and cramping, changes in complexion, and signs resembling epilepsy—except the eyes do not roll upward. The pulse is rapid and tense. In such cases, *Gentian Decoction* should be administered, with the addition of *ginseng* and *Chinese angelica*, each in equal weight to the gentian.

When a child is struck by *guest affliction*, promptly examine the area beneath the uvula on either side of the mouth. There will be a dark, swollen vein resembling a hemp seed or mung bean, which may be red, white, or green. Immediately use a needle to pierce and drain it, or scrape it away with a fingernail. Wrap silk around a hairpin to wipe away the blood.

The symptoms of *guest affliction* in young children include vomiting and diarrhea with green, yellow, red, or white fluids, abdominal pain, arching of the back, convulsions, panting resembling epilepsy—except the eyes do not roll upward, and the child’s breathing is slightly rapid. The complexion changes through five colors, and the pulse is wiry and tense. If treatment is delayed, the condition becomes difficult to cure.

**Formula for Treatment:**
Take several handfuls of fermented soybeans, moisten with water, and pound into a paste. Form into balls the size of a chicken egg. Rub the child’s fontanel and the centers of the hands and feet five or six times each. Then rub the ball over the child’s heart and navel, moving it up and down. After the time it takes to eat a meal, break the ball open to inspect it. If fine hairs are found inside, discard the ball in the road. The pain will cease.

**Formula for Treating Young Children with Guest Affliction Causing Stiff Neck and Near-Death:**
Take ten *silverfish* from clothing, grind into powder, and apply to the wet nurse’s nipples so the child may drink it. The child will recover upon swallowing. Another method: Place two *silverfish* on the child’s mother’s hand and cover the child’s navel with it. The child will vomit and recover. Alternatively, rub the child’s neck and stiff areas of the spine.

**Two-Substance Yellow Earth Formula for Treating Guest Affliction:**
Take equal parts yellow earth from the stove and earthworm excrement, pound together, and mix with water to form a ball the size of a chicken egg yolk. Apply to the child’s head and the centers of the hands and feet. Effective. Another version states to mix with egg white to form a paste.

**Another Formula:**
Swallow musk the size of a soybean. Immediate recovery.

**Formulas for Treating Childhood Guest Affliction with Periodic Outbreaks:**
Cover the child with the mother’s menstrual cloth. Highly effective.

Burn three inches of the mother’s clothing belt along with her hair, then mix with breast milk and administer.

**Another Formula:**
Administer cow’s nasal mucus.

**Another Formula:**
Apply cow’s mouth foam to the nipple for the child to drink.

**Formula for Childhood Affliction by Horse Guest Qi with Uncontrollable Vomiting:**
Moxibustion at *Hand Heart Governor*, *Intermediate Messenger*, *Great Metropolis*, *Hidden White*, and *Three Yin Intersection*, three cones each.

Powdered pellets may be prepared like fermented beans, and saliva may be used—spit while reciting the incantation.

**Incantation for Guest Affliction:**
Recite: *"Mo the father, Mo the mother, Mo the child suffers from guest affliction. From me it begins. Bian Que may be skilled, but none surpasses the efficacy of good spittle."* Upon completion, discard the pellet on the road.

**Another Method:**
Place a knife horizontally on the stove. Undress the child and expose the chest and abdomen. Take the knife, recite the incantation while spitting toward the child, then gesture with the knife toward the chest and abdomen while chanting *"fei fei"* (sound of spitting). The incantation reads: *"Resplendent, the sun rises in the east, turning from yin to face yang. Ge Lord, Ge Lord, unknown what lord you are—you come without regard, depart without a glance, passing to afflict the living. Dust on the beam, spirits of heaven."*

**Dust beneath the door—where ghosts pass through.**
Place a great knife with a rhinoceros-horn ring before the Stove Lord; spit fourteen times to cure guest affliction. If the child is startled, spit with the sound *"fei fei"* as before. Spit fourteen times, each time gesturing with the knife while chanting the incantation thrice. Then prepare a fermented soybean pellet as above, repeating five or six times. Break the pellet open to inspect it—if hairs are found within, discard it on the road, and the guest affliction will be cured.

**Methods for Childhood *Ji* Affliction:**
It is said: When a child suffers from *ji* sickness, it is because a pregnant woman, influenced by an evil spirit, directs the malevolence within her womb to envy and harm other children. *Ji* refers to a minor ghost. Not all pregnant women summon *ji* spirits, but such occurrences do arise. The symptoms of *ji* affliction include mild, intermittent diarrhea, alternating chills and fever, and a dull, listless appearance in the fine hair and temples—these are its signs. It is advisable to administer *Longdan* Decoction.

If a woman already has a young child who cannot yet walk and then conceives again, allowing the child to nurse from her will also cause *ji* affliction, resulting in the child becoming sallow, emaciated, and feverish, with hair loss—these are its signs.

**Remedies for Spirit Affliction:**
Roast a bat until cooked, then chew and feed it to the child.
**Another method:** Burn a bat to ash and administer it with water.

**Chuanxiong, for treating childhood night crying, ensuring peaceful sleep by dawn:**
Chuanxiong, white atractylodes, and stephania, each half a *liang*. Grind and sift the three ingredients, then mix with breast milk to administer, adjusting the quantity as needed. Alternatively, have the child’s mother cover the child’s navel with her hand while also rubbing the child’s head and spine—this is effective. For a twenty-day-old child unable to take powdered medicine, mix with breast milk and administer a millet-sized pill. For older children who can take powder, adjust the dosage as appropriate.

**Single-Ingredient *Qianhu* Pill, for treating childhood night crying:**
Grind *qianhu* into powder, mix with honey, and form into soybean-sized pills. Administer one pill, three times daily, gradually increasing to five or six pills until recovery.

**Another method:** Feed the child whatever food or drink the mother craved during pregnancy, and the crying will cease.

**Another method:**
Take a handful each of *fulonggan* (hearth ash) and crossroads soil. Grind, sift, mix with a small amount of water, and administer.

Apply charred horse bone ash to the nipple and let the child suckle—this will stop the crying.

*Sichuan pepper* and *left-facing oyster shell* (crushed), six *zhū* each.
Steep the two ingredients in one *shēng* of vinegar-water, decoct to five *gé*, and administer one *gé* per dose.

**On Cold Damage, Fifth Discussion: Formulas and Moxibustion Methods**

It is said: Infants cannot endure exposure to frost and snow, thus they do not contract cold damage. Adults, having long shed their protective layers, are susceptible to cold and chill—this is self-evident. Yet when seasonal *qi* strays from its proper course, even infants may fall ill. In years when epidemic diseases rage, newborns may develop rashes immediately after birth. Treatment for such seasonal afflictions follows the same principles as for adults, though the dosage and medicinal strength are slightly reduced, and the formulas are somewhat cooler.

**Pediatric Formulas: Coughing (Section Six)**

**For Infants:**
When an infant is around two hundred days old, small sores may appear on the head and body. Even after slight recovery, they may recur. In the fifth month, a mild cough may suddenly arise. If treated with gentle warming methods, it may transform into convulsions, occurring twenty times a day. The limbs contract, the spine stiffens, the eyes roll back, and breathing briefly ceases before revival. Though treated with standard convulsion decoctions, inducing vomiting and purging brings relief, the episodes persist daily. Later, administering only bamboo sap gradually shows improvement—over a day and night, about one *shēng* is consumed. During episodes, the condition slightly eases. The next day, the *Bamboo Sap Decoction* induces vomiting and purging, significantly reducing the severity of attacks. Bamboo sap is continued intermittently.

Repeated use yields divine efficacy. A *qiān jīn* formula not transmitted to outsiders:

**Formulas for the Seven Orifices #1: Eye Diseases**

**Discourse, Symptoms, Formulas, Incantations, Moxibustion Methods**

It is said: Generally, after the age of forty-five, one’s eyesight gradually dims, but after sixty, it gradually becomes clear again. The method of treatment: before fifty, one may take *Draining the Liver Decoction*; after fifty, the liver must not be drained. If there is disease in the eyes, one may apply *Chalcanthite Powder* and the like. If there is no disease, one must not apply powders indiscriminately—simply tonify the liver. Naturally, if there is wind-heat in the liver causing dim or dark vision, one should apply moxibustion to the liver transport point and take several dozen doses of *Dispelling Wind Decoction*, pills, or powders, and the condition will resolve.

**Activities That Harm the Eyes:**
Consuming the five pungent vegetables raw
Eating or drinking while overheated
Consuming hot, fermented foods
Drinking alcohol without restraint
Indulging in the bedchamber without moderation
Straining the eyes to gaze into the distance
Frequently observing the sun and moon
Gazing at stars and firelight at night
Reading fine script at night
Reading under moonlight
Copying texts for many years
Engraving fine work
Gambling without cease
Remaining amid smoke and fire for long periods
Excessive weeping
Excessive blood loss from bloodletting during haircutting

These sixteen practices are all fundamental causes of vision loss. Those who cultivate their nature should be thoroughly cautious of them. Additionally, galloping during hunting, braving wind and frost, chasing beasts against the wind day and night without rest—these too are agents of eye injury. Indulging fleeting impulses may lead to lifelong chronic ailments; how can one not be vigilant?

When young, if one does not exercise self-restraint, by the age of forty, the eyes will gradually grow dim. If one can adhere to these precautions, one may preserve clear vision into old age. Thus, after the age of forty, one should often close the eyes and avoid gazing about. Unless there is urgent business, one should not open them lightly. This is the ultimate method of protection and caution.

Those who overstrain their eyes through excessive reading, gambling, and the like suffer from what is called "liver taxation." To cure this, one must close the eyes and refrain from looking for three years; otherwise, recovery is impossible. Merely draining the liver or applying various treatments will ultimately be ineffective.

When one suffers from wind rashes, dim vision often follows. First, dispel the wind, and the dimness will naturally resolve.

When the foot Taiyang, Yangming, or hand Shaoyang channels stir, eye diseases arise.

The Yellow Emperor asked: "Once, I ascended the Qingling Terrace. Midway up the steps, I turned to look back, crawling forward on my hands and knees. I privately found this strange and inwardly wondered at it. At times, I would close my eyes in darkness, calming my mind and regulating my qi. After a long while, the sensation did not dissipate. I loosened my hair, knelt upright, and looked downward, yet after some time, it persisted. Suddenly, it ceased on its own. What qi causes this?"

Qibo replied: "The essential qi of the five viscera and six bowels all ascend and infuse the eyes, forming the eyeballs. The essence of bone forms the pupil; the essence of sinews forms the dark of the eye; the essence of blood forms its network of vessels; the essence of qi forms the white of the eye; and the essence of flesh forms the eyelids and their binding. The essence of sinews, bones, blood, and qi, together with the vessels, form the ocular connections. These connections ascend to the brain and emerge at the nape.

Thus, when pathogenic qi invades the nape and encounters bodily deficiency, it penetrates deeply and follows the ocular connections into the brain. Once in the brain, it causes turning, which pulls on the ocular connections, making them tense. Tension leads to dizziness and vertigo.

If the pathogen strikes the eyeball directly, the affected part loses coordination, causing the eyeball to scatter. Scattering leads to double vision, so one sees two objects.

The eyes are the essence of the five viscera and six bowels, the domain where constructive and defensive qi, the ethereal and corporeal souls circulate, and where spirit and qi are generated. Thus, when the spirit is taxed, the ethereal and corporeal souls scatter, and the will and intent become disordered. For this reason, the pupil and dark of the eye correspond to yin, while the white of the eye and red vessels correspond to yang. When yin and yang unite and turn together, vision becomes clear.

The eyes are the messengers of the heart; the heart is the abode of the spirit. Thus, when the spirit scatters and the essence is disordered, sudden encounters with the extraordinary cause the spirit, ethereal soul, and corporeal soul to disperse and lose coherence, resulting in confusion."

The Emperor said: "Why does this happen? Whenever I go to the Eastern Garden, I invariably become disoriented, but upon leaving, I recover. Do I alone tax my spirit in the Eastern Garden? Why is it so peculiar?"

Qibo replied: "It is not so."

When the heart harbors joy while the spirit abhors it, their sudden clash disrupts essence and distorts vision, causing spiritual confusion. Only when the spirit shifts does clarity return—mild cases bring bewilderment, severe ones delusion.

The outer canthus where the eyes open onto the face is called the *dui-pi*; the inner corner near the nose, with its upper part as the *outer canthus* and lower as the *inner canthus*. Redness in the eyes signals heart disease; whiteness, lung disease; blueness, liver disease; yellowness, spleen disease; blackness, kidney disease. If the yellow hue defies description, the illness lies in the chest.

When diagnosing eye pain: if red vessels descend from above, it is *Taiyang* disease; if they ascend from below, *Yangming* disease; if they traverse from outer to inner, *Shaoyang* disease.

For chronic nasal discharge with unceasing turbid flow, leading to nasal congestion, blurred vision, and dizziness, this stems from *qi* counterflow. The *Foot Yangming* channel runs alongside the nose into the face, called *Xuanlu*, connecting to the mouth and linking to the root of the eyes. For visual distortions, reduce excess and supplement deficiency—reversing this worsens the condition.

The *Foot Taiyang* channel passes through the nape into the brain, directly connecting to the root of the eyes, called the *eye system*. For persistent headaches and eye pain, needle the space between the two tendons in the nape, where it enters the brain to branch into the *Yin Qiao* vessel. Yin and yang intersect here, with yang entering and yin exiting, and yang converging at the *dui-pi*. Excess yang *qi* causes squinting; depletion of yin *qi* induces deep sleep.

**Formulas for Disorders of the Seven Orifices**
**Fourth Formula: Tongue Disorders**

**Cimicifuga Decoction**
The tongue governs the heart viscus; when heat arises, it manifests upon the tongue, causing sores, fissures, and cracking, with redness spreading to the lips. This formula drains heat:
*Three liang* each of *Sichuan cimicifuga* and *belamcanda rhizome*; one *sheng* of sliced *cypress leaf*; two *liang* of *dyer’s woad leaf*; five *ge* each of sliced *bitter bamboo leaf* and *rehmannia juice*; three *ge* of *fresh figwort juice*; eight *ge* of *red honey*; five *liang* each of *fresh reed rhizome* and *white bark of multiflora rose root*.
Grind the ten ingredients coarsely, then decoct in four *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains. Strain, add the *figwort juice*, and bring to two boils; next add the *rehmannia juice*, bringing to two boils; then add the honey, and simmer until one *sheng* and seven *ge* remain. Soak silk floss in the liquid, squeeze out the juice, place upon the tongue, and swallow gradually.

**Formula for Tongue Sores Preventing Eating, with Stiffness at the Root and Pain on Both Sides of the Neck (Caused by Heart Vacuity Heat):**
Two *liang* each of *bupleurum*, *cimicifuga*, *peony*, *gardenia seed*, and *tetrapanax pith*; one and a half *liang* each of *scutellaria* and *dyer’s woad leaf*; one *liang* of *apricot kernel*; four *liang* each of *fresh ginger* and *gypsum*.
Grind the ten ingredients coarsely, then decoct in one *dou* and nine *sheng* of water until three and a half *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses, taking three during the day and one at night. The dregs may be decocted again for further use.

**Formula for Sudden Swelling of the Tongue, Filling the Mouth and Protruding Like a Blown-Up Pig’s Bladder, Obstructing Breath (If Untreated, Fatal in Moments):**
Urgent: Scrape both sides of the tongue with a finger to release the fluid, and recovery will follow. Alternatively, incise both sides with a lance, then apply wound ointment.
**Another Formula:**
Pierce the two large veins beneath the tongue to release blood, but avoid the central vein beneath the tongue—uncontrolled bleeding is fatal. If the above treatment fails or excessive blood loss occurs, heat an iron comb until red-hot and cauterize the wound several times to stanch the bleeding.
**Another Formula:**
Wash twelve *pinellia* tubers thoroughly, then decoct in one *sheng* of vinegar until eight *ge* remain. Hold the liquid in the mouth and rinse gradually, spitting it out. Adding one *liang* of *fresh ginger* enhances efficacy.

**Formula for Tongue Swelling Like a Pig’s Bladder:**
Grind soot from beneath a cauldron into powder, mix thickly with vinegar, and apply to the upper and lower surfaces of the tongue. Replace when dry; the swelling will subside shortly. If blood and fluid have already been drained, application is even more effective.
In all such cases, people often fail to recognize the condition, and misdiagnosis worsens the affliction, hastening death. Examine the underside of the tongue: there may appear creatures resembling mole crickets or silkworm pupae. Upon close inspection, they have heads and tails, with slightly white heads. Heat an iron nail and cauterize the head of the creature until cooked, and it will dissolve.

**Formula for Stiff, Swollen Tongue Filling the Mouth:**
Hold a small amount of sugar and vinegar in the mouth until warmth spreads, then cease.

**Formula for Tongue Swelling Filling the Mouth, Preventing Speech:**
One *sheng* of *water shield*; thirty-three *earthworms*.
Decoct the two ingredients in three *sheng* of water until three boils occur. Hold the liquid in the mouth, swallowing gradually, three times daily.

**Formula for Stiff Tongue Preventing Speech:**
*Alum* and *cassia heartwood*, in equal parts, ground to powder. Place beneath the tongue for immediate relief.

If the tongue turns black with several holes as large as chopsticks, from which blood gushes like a spring, this indicates a heart-organ disorder. The formula for its treatment:

Five *liang* each of *rong* salt, scutellaria (alternatively, mallow seeds), phellodendron, and rhubarb;
Two *liang* each of ginseng, cassia heartwood, and licorice.
Grind the seven ingredients into powder and form honeyed pills the size of parasol seeds. Take ten pills with water, three times daily.
Alternatively, cauterize with a heated iron comb.

**Formula for Blood Gushing from the Tongue Like a Spring:**
Cauterize the holes thoroughly with a heated iron comb; this is highly effective.

**Fifth Section on Lip Disorders: Methods for Jia Decoction and Moxibustion**

**Method for Scorched Lips Due to Spleen Heat #1**
**Spleen-Moistening Paste, a formula for spleen heat causing lips to scorch, dry, and lack moisture:**

One *sheng* each of fresh asparagus (cut) and fresh rehmannia juice;
Four *liang* each of fresh ophiopogon and Solomon’s seal;
Three *sheng* of lard;
Two *liang* each of asarum, licorice, chuanxiong, and atractylodes;
Three *liang* each of astragalus and cimicifuga.
Coarsely grind the eleven ingredients, soak them in vinegar overnight, then wrap in silk. When decocting, add the fresh rehmannia juice and lard, and simmer until the paste emits a crackling sound and all watery vapor dissipates. Strain and take small amounts to hold in the mouth.

**Jia Decoction Lip Balm, a formula for cracked, malodorous lips:**

First, pound hemp into a paste and coat the interiors of two fine porcelain jars (each with a capacity of one *dou* or more) to a thickness of half a *cun*, then sun-dry until firm.

Five *liang* of spikenard;
One *liang* each of *ai-na* fragrance, clover fragrance, and cogon grass;
Three *liang* of patchouli;
Four *liang* of *ling-ling* fragrance.
First, mix one *sheng* of wine with five *sheng* of water to make a decoction, wash the fragrances clean, then chop. Soak again in one *sheng* each of wine and water overnight. The next morning, take one *dou* and five *sheng* of sesame oil, add the six ingredients, and decoct over a low flame, stirring three times up and three times down. Strain and pour into one of the jars, leaving a small space unfilled.

Then take:
Three *jin* of high-grade agarwood;
Three *liang* each of sparrow-head fragrance and storax;
Five *liang* each of benzoin and sandalwood;
One *liang* each of clove, musk, and *jia* fragrance.
First, mix wine and water to make a decoction, wash the fragrances clean, then pound each separately (not too finely). Mix the fragrances with two *sheng* of honey and one *sheng* of wine, then pack tightly into the second jar. Seal the jar’s mouth with silk, secure it with crossed bamboo strips to prevent fragrance from escaping.

Bury the oil jar in the ground so its mouth is level with the surface. Place the fragrance jar upside-down over the oil jar, aligning their mouths. Seal the junction with hemp paste to a thickness of half a *cun*, ensuring it is firm and airtight. Pile chaff five *cun* thick over the jars and ignite. When the fire nearly extinguishes, add more chaff. Burn continuously for three days and nights without letting the fire die, using a total of twelve *shi* of chaff. Afterward, let it cool for three days before uncovering.

Separately, refine eight *jin* of wax, boiling it several times. Add twelve *liang* of gromwell, decocting until a gromwell stem, when scraped against a fingernail, reveals white beneath. Strain through silk, then blend with the previous decoction. Add six *liang* of cinnabar powder and stir well. While still warm but before it solidifies, pour into bamboo tubes. Wrap the tubes in paper and bind with hemp. Once cooled and set, unwrap and use as desired. This yields approximately fifty sticks.

**Jia Decoction Lip Balm, a formula for pale, bloodless lips and halitosis:**

**Method for Burning Fragrant Unction:**
Agarwood, *jia* fragrance, clove, musk, sandalwood, storax, frankincense, *ling-ling* fragrance, benzoin, patchouli, spikenard, and *ze-lan*.

The above twelve ingredients, each six *liang*, with five *sheng* of sesame oil. First, decoct the oil until hot, then add benzoin, patchouli, spikenard, and *ze-lan*. After a short time, remove from heat and strain through silk into a porcelain jar. Grind the remaining eight fragrances into powder, mix with honey—without making it too moist—and fill a small porcelain jar to the brim. Cover the mouth with silk, secure it with crossed bamboo strips, then invert the small jar over the larger oil jar so their mouths align. Seal tightly with clay. Dig a hole to bury the oil jar, level with the ground, then pile dry cow dung around it and ignite. Alternatively, use chaff for the fire. Burn continuously for seven days and nights; haste is unnecessary. Twelve days yields even better results. Once cooled, remove the contents—now complete.

The jars must be evenly coated with well-kneaded clay, one *cun* thick, and sun-dried before use.

**Method for Refining Wax and Blending with Jia Decoction:**
Two *liang* each of wax and gromwell. First, melt the wax, then add gromwell and decoct briefly. Test by scraping a gromwell stem against a fingernail—if the inner flesh appears white, remove it. Add the wax, ensuring it does not solidify, then pour in one *he* of Jia Decoction. Stir evenly, pour into tubes, and avoid disturbing until cool and set. This yields fine lip balm.

Apply to lips and face three times daily.

**Formula for Tight Lips:**
Roll white cloth into a thick wick the size of a finger, place on a cleaver blade, and light it over a stove until the blade sweats. Wipe the moisture onto the lips, two or three times daily. Used cloth works as well, and this also treats sunken lips.

**Formulas for the Seven Orifices**
**Sixth Discourse on Teeth: Formulas and Moxibustion**

It is said: For exposed tooth roots, most cases stem from *gan*-sores or "lunar erosion." Apply *jiaohao* ash at night to the gums, filling the gaps, and avoid consuming oil. Healing occurs within two or three nights. Eating oil or dried jujubes will cause relapse, so those with dental ailments must abstain from oil, dried jujubes, and *guixin*.

Each morning, take a pinch of *guan* powder into the mouth, swish with warm water, rub the teeth, and tap them one hundred times without ceasing. Within five days, the teeth will become firm and dense.

For those unable to eat fruits or vegetables due to exposed tooth roots, this *guan* decoction for rubbing and tapping the teeth will invariably cure the condition. It is divinely efficacious.

Dental diseases often arise from eating or drinking on nights of lunar eclipses. The wise should take great care to avoid this. Thus, during solar or lunar eclipses, one must abstain from food and drink—this applies to children as well.

**Formula for Dental Caries and Worm-Induced Toothache:**

At dawn, take the grass, bend it to two *cun* long, one *cun* wide, and five *fen* thick, then wrap and bind it with the gourd leaves to make fifty or sixty bundles. Soak them in three-year-old vinegar until midday, then take two bundles, roast them in fire until scorching hot, and press them against the outer side of the affected tooth. Replace when cool. Use a copper vessel filled with water to rinse the bundles after use. The extracted worms will be three *fen* long—older ones yellow-red, younger ones white. Many cases yield thirty or forty worms; fewer cases yield ten or twenty.

**Formula for Worm-Infested Teeth:**
Three *ge* of *genruo* seeds (if unavailable, onion or leek seeds may substitute). Heat seven bronze coins until red-hot, then place them in a small-mouthed jar suitable for holding in the mouth. Add a pinch of *genruo* seeds atop the coins, causing a crackling sound, then pour half a *ge* of water to generate steam. Hold the jar’s mouth to the mouth, ensuring no steam escapes, and fumigate the tooth. Repeat when cool, using all three *ge* of the medicine. This not only cures worm-infested teeth but also treats wind-induced toothache, dental caries, and other tooth ailments. Spit out excess saliva.

Dig up a fresh aconite root, pare while moist into a piece the size of a jujube pit, and insert into the ear, replacing daily. Healing occurs in no more than three days. Also cures itching and sudden wind-induced deafness.

**For Suppurative Otitis with Pus:**
Take equal parts alum, coptis, cuttlebone, and red halloysite. Grind into powder.

Wrap a piece the size of a jujube pit in silk and insert into the ear, replacing three times daily. The *Xiaopin* version omits red halloysite, while Master Yao’s formula adds one *liang* of dragon bone; the *Qianjin Yifang* follows Master Yao’s version.

**For Suppurative Otitis with Pain and Pus-Blood Discharge:**
Take soot from beneath a cauldron, apply thinly into the ear, and replace three times daily. Each time, remove the old application with a small comb before reapplying, continuing until healed.

**For Suppurative Otitis:**
Take ripe peach kernels, pound thoroughly, wrap in old binding silk, and insert into the ear, replacing three times daily until healed.

**For Chronic Otitis (Bottom Ear):**
Take roasted yellow alum, wrap in silk, and insert into the ear; healing occurs within two or three days. Alternatively, blow into the ear through a reed tube. The *Zhoufu* states this also treats sudden ear swelling with pus.

**For Insects Entering the Ear:**
Grind a pinch of Sichuan pepper into powder, mix with half a *sheng* of vinegar, and pour into the ear. Walk twenty paces, and the insect will emerge.

**Alternative Formula:**
Char peach leaves over fire, roll them up, and plug the ear; the insect will emerge immediately.

**Alternative Formula:**
Apply axle grease to the ear opening, and the insect will emerge on its own. The *Zhouhou* states this also treats suppurative otitis with pus and blood.

**Alternative Formula:**
Pour scallion juice into the ear, and the insect will emerge. This also treats deafness.

**For Centipedes Entering the Ear:**
Roast pork until fragrant, then cover the ear; the centipede will emerge.

**For Maggots Entering the Ear:**
Stir-fry sesame seeds, grind them, place in a kudzu-cloth bag, and lean the ear upon it; the maggots will emerge.

**Alternative Formula:**
Pour cow’s milk fat into the ear until full, and the maggots will emerge, partially dissolved. If they enter the abdomen, consume one to two *sheng* of fine milk fat on an empty stomach, and they will transform into yellow fluid and discharge. If not fully expelled, consume more; this method is divinely effective. The *Qianjin Yifang* uses cow’s milk.

**For Objects Lodged in the Ear (Unable to Emerge):**
Separate the strands of a bowstring, apply fine glue, and gently press against the object in the ear until adhered. Slowly draw it out.

**Formulae for Wind-Toxin and Leg Qi**

**On the Symptoms of Wind-Toxin (Section One)**
It is said: Examining the classical formulae, one often encounters discussions of "leg weakness," yet this affliction was rare among the ancients. Only after the Yongjia era, when the court crossed south, did many scholar-officials begin to suffer from it. In the regions of Lingbiao and Jiangdong, there were figures such as Zhi Facun and the monk Yang Daoren, who devoted themselves to the study of medical formulae and excelled in this art. Many eminent officials of the Jin dynasty were cured through their efforts, owing entirely to these two masters.

During the Song and Qi dynasties, the monk Shen Shi of the Buddhist clergy compiled the old formulae of Zhi Facun and others into thirty scrolls. Among these, the section on leg weakness alone contained over a hundred prescriptions. In the Wei and Zhou eras, this malady was scarcely known, which is why Yao Sengyuan’s *Collected Verifications* did not address it with urgency, and Xu Wang’s compilations did not regard it as significant.

The reason lies in the tripartite division of the realm, where customs and teachings remained ununified, and the distribution of frost and dew, cold and heat, varied. Thus, the regions west of the Pass and north of the Yellow River had no knowledge of this illness. Since the founding of the Great Tang, when the Six Directions were united and no land lay beyond its borders, the southernmost territories became a vital frontier. Those sent to garrison these lands, unaccustomed to the climate and water, invariably fell ill.

In recent times, even scholar-officials of the Central Plains who have never crossed the Yangtze have begun to suffer from it. This is surely because the *qi* of wind and climate across the realm have become uniform, and the constitution of all things has grown alike.

When this disease first manifests, it begins in the feet, which soon become swollen. The people call it "leg *qi*," while Shen Shi refers to it as "leg weakness"—both terms convey the same meaning. Shen Shi recorded over eighty prescriptions for leg weakness from Zhi Facun, including those used by Yongpingshan, Fushilian, Fan Zuyao, and Huang Su, all of which are refined and essential. However, for scholars seeking to consult them, the collection may seem overly cumbersome, for it is merely a compilation of formulae. In urgent cases, one may struggle to find guidance.

Thus, I have selected only those proven effective through experience, to prepare for emergencies. The rest are omitted.

On Why It First Affects the Feet

Question: When wind-toxin invades a person, it may strike anywhere—why does the affliction invariably settle in the feet?

Answer: The human body has five viscera. The heart and lungs govern the channels and network vessels that arise in the ten fingers of the hands; the liver, kidneys, and spleen govern those that arise in the ten toes of the feet. Wind-toxin *qi* originates from the earth, where cold, heat, wind, and dampness all generate steaming vapors. Since the feet constantly tread upon these, wind-toxin invariably strikes a person first in the feet. If left untreated over time, it spreads to the four limbs, abdomen, back, head, and neck. At first, one does not perceive it, but once it lingers and stagnates, its presence becomes known. The *Classic* speaks of "sequential transmission" and "intermittent transmission" in this regard.

On the Subtle Onset of the Disease

Most cases of leg *qi* arise from exposure to wind-toxin. Yet those who contract this disease often do not realize it at once. It may lie dormant until triggered by another illness, at which point it suddenly erupts—or one may collapse into profound stupor, remaining bedridden for two or three days before recognizing the condition. Petty physicians, ignorant of this malady, invariably misdiagnose it as some other disorder and treat it accordingly, with fatal results in every case.

Thus, this disease often goes unrecognized. At its onset, it is exceedingly subtle—appetite, drink, play, and strength remain unchanged, with only the sudden inability to flex or move the legs marking its difference. The *Yellow Emperor* calls this "slow wind-damp impediment."

On the Manifestations of Wind-Toxin

Before any abnormality in the legs is perceived, the head, neck, arms, or shoulders may already suffer; before any part shows signs of distress, the heart, abdomen, or five viscera may already be afflicted. When wind-toxin strikes, one may experience vomiting upon eating or aversion to the smell of food; there may be abdominal pain with diarrhea, or constipation with urinary retention; one may feel palpitations in the chest, an aversion to light, or mental confusion; there may be delirium, incoherent speech, high fever with headache, or extreme cold with body aches; one may sense cramping, swelling or its absence, numbness in the thighs, or intermittent flaccidity and paralysis; there may be spasms in all joints, or numbness in the lower abdomen. These are all manifestations of leg *qi*—also termed the signs of wind-toxin leg *qi*. Its symptoms are difficult to discern, and one must examine them with great care. Otherwise, the critical moment for treatment will surely be missed.

Once the disease takes hold, it defies reason—this holds true for women as well. Moreover, women after childbirth who seek coolness in spring and summer are especially prone to this toxin; they must take utmost caution. Symptoms such as feverish distress, convulsive twitching, fright palpitations, heart vexation, vomiting, and qi surging upward all belong to its manifestations. If one merely senses cold blockage below the navel, a persistent discomfort, along with dribbling urination unlike one’s usual state, this is already a sign of leg *qi*. Chronic weakness is termed "sluggish wind," while pain is called "damp impediment."

**On the Causes of Contraction**
At no time of year should one stand or sit for long on damp or cold ground, nor should one, after sweating from drunkenness, remove clothes, boots, or socks to cool off in the wind—all of which lead to leg *qi*. If in the summer months one stands or sits for long on damp ground, the hot-damp *qi* steams into the channels and network vessels, and the ensuing illness will manifest as heat, with aching limbs, vexation, and oppression. If in the cold months one stands or sits for long on damp, chilled ground, the cold-damp *qi* ascends into the channels and network vessels, and the ensuing illness will manifest as extreme cold in the limbs and cramping spasms. If one contracts it from cooling off in the wind, the illness will manifest as numbness in the skin and flesh, twitching in various places, gradually advancing toward the head.

On ordinary days, when sudden, unbearable heat arises, one must not hastily seek cold for momentary relief; nor, when sudden cold strikes, should one recklessly endure it—both give rise to illness. There are those diligent in labor or study who, wholly absorbed in their tasks, sit or stand for long on damp ground without moving, allowing cold wind to strike and enter the channels and network vessels, unnoticed until illness forms. Thus, when wind-toxin assails a person, it may first strike the fingers of the hands or feet, for when the sweat pores open and the interstices loosen, the wind enters like a swift arrow; or it may first strike the soles of the feet, the insteps, or below the knees, whether on the exterior or interior of the channels.

To prevent the disease from taking hold, one should moxa the affected area with twenty or thirty cones as soon as symptoms appear—this will bring immediate cure and prevent recurrence. The Yellow Emperor said: "Cooling off in the wind or entering the bedchamber while drunk can give rise to this illness."

**On the Difference Between Cold and Heat**
Question: Why do those afflicted experience either cold or heat?
Answer: The feet contain the three yin and three yang channels. If cold strikes the three yang, the affliction will be cold; if summerheat strikes the three yin, the affliction will be hot. Thus, there may be cold or heat in the exterior or interior, or varying degrees of cold and heat. Heat is treated with cooling medicinals, cold with warming medicinals—one must adjust according to the circumstances. If the spleen is assailed by yang toxin, it results in heat and numbness; if the kidneys are assailed by yin dampness, it results in cold impediment.

**On Leg Qi Giving Rise to Other Illnesses**
Even if one suffers from leg *qi*, it does not hinder the activation of *rushi* stones—one must still take medicinals to suppress the stones. If leg *qi* gives rise to other illnesses, one should treat them with appropriate medicinals. For inhibited urination, use *zhuling*, *fuling*, and other diuretic medicinals; for extreme constipation, use the Five Gentle Hemp Seed Pills and the like; for generalized swelling and fullness leading to water disease, use any of the medicinals from water-dispelling formulas. The rest may be treated by analogy, with no restrictions.

**On the Urgency of Treatment**

If one notices even the slightest abnormality in their condition, they must be greatly alarmed and treat it with utmost urgency. Should the affliction linger and *qi* ascend into the abdomen—whether swelling occurs or not—with fullness and counterflow in the chest and rib-sides, *qi* surging upward to the shoulders, and labored breathing, death follows swiftly in urgent cases, or within days in less acute ones. There is no excuse for delay in treatment.

Observe closely: if the region below the heart feels tense, breathing is incessant and panting, spontaneous sweating occurs frequently, or alternating chills and fever arise, with a pulse that is hurried, short, and rapid, and unceasing vomiting—all these are signs of death.

**On Deficiency and Excess: Whether Medicinals May Be Taken**
All deaths from leg *qi* arise from excess *qi*, and never has a single person perished from deficiency caused by taking medicinals. Thus, those with leg *qi* must not receive heavy supplementation, nor should they undergo drastic purgation. Yet some, fearing deficiency, refuse decoctions in advance—such patients will die without remedy.

**On Visitors and Those Who Inquire After the Sick**
In this world, many a patient’s kin, friends, acquaintances, or companions come to inquire after their illness. Though these visitors may have no experience with such afflictions and have never studied a single formula, they feign expertise, boasting of their clarity, and spin misleading theories. Some claim it is deficiency, others excess; some say it is wind, others *gu* poison; some insist it is water, others phlegm. Their contradictory and erroneous talk confounds the patient’s mind, leaving them uncertain of what is true. As time slips away, irreparable harm may befall, and all scatter in disarray.

Therefore, one must seek a person of virtue and a physician of renown, one who discerns the depth of the illness, delves into the subtleties of medical texts, and has extensively studied the classics of past and present—only such a one should examine the patient. Otherwise, grave harm may result. I lament that such misguided advice is all too common, and so I have laid bare the causes and manifestations of this disease, that future sufferers may read and guard themselves.

If even one symptom matches, hasten to treat it according to the formula, and do not heed the words of outsiders, lest you bring regret upon yourself. Study the intent of the formulas carefully. Death is not difficult to accept—do not trust others’ words and thus bring ruin upon yourself.

I once composed a decoction of *men*dong, which has proven highly effective in treating leg *qi*. Those afflicted should make use of it.

**On Pulse Diagnosis**
Though the diagnostic methods for leg *qi* are manifold, the pulse at the three positions must fundamentally align with the four seasons to be auspicious. If it runs counter to the seasons, do not attempt treatment. For other pulse signs, refer to the *Mai Jing*; I shall not repeat them here. Those who are naturally dark and lean are easier to cure, while those who are plump, fleshy, and fair-skinned with a ruddy complexion are difficult to heal.

Those who are dark-skinned endure wind and dampness; those who are fair and ruddy do not. The lean have firm flesh, while the plump have soft flesh—soft flesh allows illness to penetrate deeply, making it difficult to cure.

**On Swelling or Lack Thereof**
When one has long suffered from leg *qi* without realizing it, and later another illness arises, treatment may bring recovery, only for vomiting and renewed leg weakness to follow. I once diagnosed such a case and informed the patient it was leg *qi*. The patient protested, "I have never suffered from leg swelling—why call it leg *qi*?" Refusing the decoction, the patient’s condition was suspected to be *shi* illness. In the uncertainty, death came within ten days. Thus, leg *qi* cannot be judged solely by swelling—some swell, others do not. If the lower abdomen becomes numb and insensitive, the legs often do not swell. Once numbness in the lower abdomen sets in, vomiting follows within three to five days, a condition called "leg *qi* entering the heart." Such cases perish within a day or two. Leg *qi* that reaches the heart is difficult to treat, for the Water of the Kidneys overcomes the Fire of the Heart.

**On Necessary Precautions**
For those afflicted with leg *qi*, one must strictly avoid sexual activity, mutton, beef, fish, garlic, *ji* greens, cabbage, turnips, bottle gourd, wine, wheat flour, butter, milk gruel, pork, chicken, goose, and duck. Though some formulas use carp heads, all these must be strictly forbidden. One must also avoid great anger.

Only rice, millet, glutinous millet, fermented soybean paste, scallions, leeks, Chinese chives, pepper, ginger, and tangerine peel may be consumed. One must not eat any raw fruits or sour and vinegary foods—those who violate this will not recover. Fresh cow’s milk and raw chestnuts are highly recommended.

**On How Many Days It Takes for a Skilled Physician to Cure the Condition**
Leg *qi* claims many lives needlessly. Broadly speaking, there are three types of patients prone to such deaths: first, those who delay treatment until the condition worsens; second, the arrogant and obstinate; and third, the indecisive and doubtful. These three dispositions mark those who perish unjustly.

Thus, while the world may lack skilled physicians, even when they exist, few patients possess the temperament to receive treatment properly. Just as a fine steed may never meet its Bo Le, or a sage like Confucius may find no disciples, so too are such deaths in vain. For those who do possess the proper disposition and follow the method I prescribe, a cure may be achieved in no more than ten days. As for those without such a disposition, treatment is futile—even if attempted, recovery may never come.

Not only beriberi, but all diseases follow this principle. Though fine medicines and wise counsel lie before one’s eyes, they cannot compel belief. The method is taught to those who trust, not expounded to those who doubt.

**On Moxibustion Therapy**
For beriberi, at the first sign of leg weakness, hasten to apply moxibustion while administering bamboo sap decoction. After moxibustion, one may take the *Eight Winds Powder*—none who do so fail to recover, provided treatment is swift. If a patient receives only moxibustion without taking the powder, or takes the powder without moxibustion, half will recover and half will die. Even those who recover may relapse within a year or two. But those who, upon sensing the onset, promptly undergo moxibustion and take the powder as prescribed will be cured ten out of ten times. Though mild cases may not immediately worsen, improper treatment leaves the root cause unaddressed, and over time, the disease will prove fatal. One must attend to this with utmost care.

Begin by moxibusting *Fengshi* (Wind Market), then *Futu* (Crouching Rabbit), followed by *Dubi* (Calf’s Nose), the two depressions beside the knee, *Zusanli* (Three Li), *Shang Lian* (Upper Ridge), *Xia Lian* (Lower Ridge), and *Juegu* (Severed Bone). There are eight points in total:

1. **Fengshi (Wind Market)**: Have the patient stand upright with arms hanging straight down, fingers extended to touch the thighs. The point lies where the middle finger rests on the large tendon of the thigh. Apply one hundred cones of moxa; more may be used as needed. For mild cases, do not reduce below one hundred cones; for severe cases, up to five or six hundred cones may be applied to a single point. Avoid applying all at once—three sessions are preferable.

2. **Futu (Crouching Rabbit)**: Have the patient sit cross-legged. Place the patient’s hand horizontally over the knee; the point lies at the midpoint of the upper edge of the hand where it aligns with the top of the bent knee. Apply one hundred cones, or as few as fifty.

3. **Dubi (Calf’s Nose)**: Located at the upper edge of the kneecap, on the outer side where the bone flattens. Pressing with the hand reveals a joint space. Some say it lies below the kneecap, near the outer three bones of the leg’s "winnowing basket" shape, where a depression is felt when the foot moves. Apply fifty to one hundred cones.

4. **Xiyan (Knee Eyes)**: The two depressions on either side below the kneecap.

5. **Zusanli (Three Li)**: One handbreadth below the knee joint, beside the outer edge of the shinbone. Some say three *cun* below the knee joint. Measure according to the patient’s handbreadth. Apply one hundred cones.

6. **Shang Lian (Upper Ridge)**: One handbreadth below *Zusanli*, also beside the outer edge of the shinbone. Apply one hundred cones.

7. **Xia Lian (Lower Ridge)**: One handbreadth below *Shang Lian*. Some say it lies beside the outer edge of the shinbone. Apply one hundred cones.

8. **Juegu (Severed Bone)**: One handbreadth above the outer ankle. Some say four *cun*. For all these points, do not apply all cones at once; daily sessions over three days are best to complete the full count.

If one leg is affected, moxibust one leg; if both, moxibust both. Most cases of leg weakness involve both legs.

Another method states: At the first sign of leg discomfort, moxibust *Zusanli* and *Juegu* on the affected side. If both legs are affected, moxibust all four points. The number of cones should correspond to the severity, but even in mild cases, do not reduce below one hundred. If recovery does not follow, proceed to moxibust the remaining points—more is better. Some say *Juegu* is the most critical.

If a patient with leg weakness delays treatment until the disease enters the abdomen, causing swelling and upward counterflow of *qi*, then major moxibustion is required. Apply moxa to all transport points, joints, and along the abdomen and back, while administering *Eight Winds Powder*. Many recover this way. The methods for locating transport points and joint spaces are detailed in another volume.

If the disease has entered the abdomen but the patient cannot endure the pain of extensive moxibustion, focus on the chest, heart, abdomen, and leg points—some still recover. To measure one handbreadth: place the hand palm-down with fingers spread, and measure across the middle joint of the four fingers. There are two types of handbreadths—one using three fingers, the other four. For leg weakness moxibustion, use the four-finger measurement, following the branch method and preserving the old technique.

Other points include: *Liangqiu*, *Dubi*, *Zusanli*, *Shang Lian*, *Xia Lian*, *Jiexi*, *Taichong*, *Yanglingquan*, *Juegu*, *Kunlun*, *Yinlingquan*, *Sanyinjiao*, *Zutaiyin*, *Fuliu*, *Rangu*, *Yongquan*, *Chengshan*, and *Shugu*—eighteen points in total. Older methods often included moxibustion at *Baihui*, *Fengfu*, and the transport and alarm points of the five *zang* and six *fu*. However, recent practice finds these tend to draw *qi* upward, so they are no longer used. They may be employed if *qi* does not rise. For advanced cases where recovery is doubtful, all points should be moxibusted.

The eight points located one *fen* from the base of each toe (eight in total on both feet) are called the *Eight Rushing Points* by the Cao school. They are highly effective for descending *qi*. The tips of the toes are called *Qi Ends*. Apply three cones daily to each, a most essential technique. The *Eight Rushing Points* may receive seven cones daily until *qi* descends. Without the patient’s full trust, do not perform this moxibustion. Exercise extreme caution.

For the *Eight Rushing Points*, use small moxa cones.

**On Decoctions and Pulse Diagnosis**
When wind-toxin *qi* enters the body, the pulse presents in three types, with similar internal and external symptoms but differing pulses:

- If the pulse is floating, large, and moderate, administer two doses of *Continuing Life Decoction*—recovery should follow.
- If wind is severe, prepare *Yuebi Decoction* with four *liang* of white wood.
- If the pulse is floating, large, and tight, prepare *Bamboo Sap Decoction*.
- If the pulse is faint and weak, administer *Wind-Drawing Decoction*—such pulses often arise from deficiency.
- For severe deficiency with shortness of breath and fatigue, intersperse with tonifying decoctions, adjusting for cold or heat. If recovery does not follow, administer *Bamboo Sap Decoction* again.

If the patient’s pulse is floating, large, and tight, this is the most malign of the three pulse types. Or if the pulse is deep and fine, this pulse is equally malign as the floating, large, and tight one. A floating and large pulse indicates the illness is external; a deep and fine pulse indicates it is internal. The treatment is not different—one must carefully adjust according to the condition. Though the patient’s appearance may still seem tolerable and the limbs not yet severely weakened, within days, *qi* will rise and life will end. Such pulses often appear in patients, yet none survive. Administer *Bamboo Sap Decoction* urgently, one dose per day, ensuring the decoction’s effect is continuous—never allow even half a day without it. This decoction relies on abundant bamboo sap; if not taken extremely hot, it may stagnate in the chest and heart, causing further harm. Each dose must be taken piping hot. If the patient experiences purgation after taking *Bamboo Sap Decoction*, this is auspicious. If after three doses the illness and pulse remain unchecked, and the patient suffers from distension and fullness, administer *Large Turtle Shell Decoction* to induce purgation. If the decoction’s effect wanes and purgation does not occur, use a pill to assist the decoction in inducing it. After purgation, resume *Bamboo Sap Decoction* and hasten to subdue the pulse and regulate the breath, then discontinue. Administering *Thirty-Two Ingredient Eight Winds Powder* is beneficial.

For those initially afflicted, apply *Wild Kudzu Paste* twice daily until stubborn numbness and leg weakness fully resolve. If after taking *Bamboo Sap Decoction* the pulse returns to its pre-illness state, strength improves, and the legs remain unable to walk, but the body’s vigor is restored, then gradually begin light walking. In severe cases, recovery may take half a year before the patient can walk with assistance.

Once the pulse and internal condition are restored, continue diligently taking *Eight Winds Powder*. Do not lightly introduce other treatments due to the legs’ inability to walk—additional therapies may not bring full benefit and could instead generate further complications, undermining these treatments. Avoid applying *Wild Kudzu Paste* carelessly. Some, hearing of *Bamboo Sap Decoction* and fearing harm to the waist or legs, refuse its use—this is due to their lack of receptivity to medical treatment. Such doubts need not be explained to those who resist.

There are three versions of *Bamboo Sap Decoction*: for mild cases, use the first formula; for severe cases, proceed in order to the subsequent formulas.

This wind-toxin is highly contagious. Administer *Small Gold Tooth Powder* in empty spaces, applying a small amount to the nostrils and ear openings. For those tending to the critically ill or newly deceased—who are prone to transmission—strong individuals should also take it and apply it to the ears and nose before approaching the deceased or the sick. Carry a *cun* square of the powder in a crimson pouch, tied to the left arm for men and the right for women. This powder detoxifies; when taking it, begin with a small dose.

*Gold Tooth Powder*’s formula is found in another volume.

The patient should only drink *Red Small Bean Beverage*. In winter, take *Aconite and Gold Tooth Wine*.

*Continuing Life Decoction* treats wind-toxin. At the onset, the illness resembles epidemic toxin disease, with a floating and moderate pulse that never changes—this is incurable. Some die within days, others within ten; some lose consciousness, or develop jaundice, rashes, red eyes, or perineal ulceration—this is most urgent. At the first sign, administer one dose of *Continuing Life Decoction*, followed by *Pueraria Decoction* or *Ephedra Decoction* to induce purgation. If the condition does not improve, administer two or three more doses of *Continuing Life Decoction*—recovery should follow. This illness is critical; ensure the decoction’s effect is continuous—never allow even half a day without it, or it will prove fatal.

The formula for *Continuing Life Decoction* is found in another volume.

**Formula for Initial Onset of Leg Qi**, where swelling and pain ascend from the foot to the knee along the meridians and bones:
Take *Ricinus* leaves, chop, steam, and apply thinly wrapped. Change two or three times daily to resolve. *Ricinus* seeds resemble the *cattle tick insect*, hence the name *tick hemp*. In winter when *tick hemp* is unavailable, take *Dipsacus* root, pound, and mix with three parts wine dregs and one part root. Steam until hot, then apply warm to the swelling as before, changing twice daily to resolve. This also treats numbness and stubborn impediment. Though not a decoction, this formula appears here as the preceding three were all recorded by Attendant Su.

**Formula for Swelling Ascending to the Thighs**, reaching the lower abdomen with distension and scant, dribbling urine:
Take one *sheng* of bull urine, divide into two doses, and consume twice daily until resolved. *Supplement to the Thousand Gold Prescriptions* states: for emaciated individuals, combine two parts urine with one part cow’s milk, boil until the milk forms a skin, then consume.

If the swelling has subsided yet these symptoms persist, administer this decoction urgently—a formula of Attendant Su, divinely efficacious:

Ephedra, *Belamcanda*, ginseng, *Poria*, *Stephania*, *Peucedanum*, and *Aurantii Fructus Immaturus* each two *liang*; *Pinellia*, rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, *Aristolochia*, tangerine peel, apricot kernel, and *Cimicifuga* each one *liang*; fresh ginger five *liang*; *Angelica pubescens* three *liang*; and *Evodia* one *sheng*. The seventeen ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in twelve *sheng* of water until four *sheng* remain. Divide into five doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk twenty *li*, with a small serving of congee between to support stomach *qi*. This decoction is taken once every two days until the pathogenic *qi* retreats; adjust according to the condition.

If heat is severe with panting and vexation, add six *liang* of gypsum and one *sheng* of fresh *Ophiopogon*, omitting *Evodia*. If there is hardness below the heart, add one *liang* of turtle shell.

Now, *foot-qi* disease first arose in Lingnan and gradually spread to Jiangdong. Its onset may be sudden or insidious: slight pain and numbness, swelling along both channels, difficulty walking with weakness, or ascending to the abdomen with loss of sensation; alternating cold and heat, scant and difficult urination, panting, *qi* rushing to the throat, gasping as if near death, vomiting upon eating, or *qi* counterflow—all these are its signs.

At the first sign of these symptoms, administer the Rhinoceros Horn and *Inula* Decoction:

Rhinoceros horn and *Inula* each two *liang*; tangerine peel, *Poria*, and fresh ginger each three *liang*; seven *jujubes*; one *sheng* of fermented soybean; and a handful of perilla stems and leaves. The eight ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in eight *sheng* of water until two *sheng* and seven *ge* remain. Divide into three doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk ten *li*, continuing until *qi* descends and urination flows freely. *Master Cui’s* version calls this the Minor Rhinoceros Horn Decoction. If *qi* does not descend, proceed to the Major Rhinoceros Horn Decoction.

The Major Rhinoceros Horn Decoction treats *foot-qi* where toxin ascends to the heart, transforming into water with generalized swelling, stupor, and near-death:

Rhinoceros horn, *Inula*, *Atractylodes*, cinnamon bark, *Stephania*, *Scutellaria*, fresh ginger, tangerine peel, and *Poria* each two *liang*; one *sheng* of fermented soybean; *Morus* bark and *Peucedanum* each four *liang*; ten *jujubes*; and a handful of perilla stems and leaves. The fourteen ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in nine *sheng* of water until two *sheng* and seven *ge* remain. Divide into three doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk ten *li*, continuing until *qi* descends. If *qi* descends, urination flows, leg swelling subsides, and appetite returns. If the decoction fails to descend *qi* and panting persists, proceed to the Rhinoceros Horn and Ephedra Decoction.

*Master Cui’s* version substitutes *Cynanchum* for *Morus* bark, omitting *Stephania*, *Scutellaria*, and *Morus* bark, calling it the *Inula* Decoction.

The Rhinoceros Horn and Ephedra Decoction:

Rhinoceros horn, ephedra, *Saposhnikovia*, *Angelica pubescens* (*Master Cui* uses *Poria*), *Stephania*, *Ligusticum*, *Paeonia* (*Master Cui* uses asarum), *Angelica sinensis*, *Scutellaria*, antelope horn, gypsum four *liang*, fresh ginger, licorice, apricot kernel (*Master Cui* uses asarum), and cinnamon bark each three *liang*. The fifteen ingredients are to be broken up; decoct ephedra in two *dou* of water, skim the foam, reduce to eight *sheng*, then add the remaining ingredients and simmer until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk ten *li*. After each dose, cover to induce sweating. If unresolved, repeat after five days, inducing sweat as before.

The *Evodia* Decoction treats *foot-qi* ascending to the abdomen with extreme distress, near-death, and abdominal distension—a formula of Attendant Su:

Six *sheng* of *Evodia* and two sliced *Chaenomeles* fruits. Decoct in thirteen *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk ten *li*. Relief may come through vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, or intense heat and distress. This is a formula to revive the dying.

The Minor Wind-Drawing Decoction treats wind stroke with lumbar and leg pain and weakness—*Hu Qia’s* version is called the Major Wind-Drawing Decoction:

*Angelica pubescens*, *Poria*, and ginseng each three *liang*; *Saposhnikovia*, *Angelica sinensis*, licorice, and dried ginger (*Hu Qia* uses cinnamon bark) each two *liang*; *Dendrobium* (*Hu Qia* uses *Astragalus*); one *Aconite* tuber; and two *sheng* of soybeans. The ten ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in nine *sheng* of water and three *sheng* of wine until three *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses, spaced by the time it takes to walk ten *li*.

*Hu Qia* notes: Southern treatments for leg weakness differ, using one *liang* of *Cimicifuga*, two *liang* each of *Pinellia* and *Paeonia*, totaling thirteen ingredients. The original formula has ten, omitting *Angelica sinensis* and *Dendrobium*, and is called the Minor Wind-Drawing Decoction. *The Abridged Emergency Formulas* omits *Dendrobium*, using it to treat extreme cold in the flesh, muscle transformation, tongue atrophy, and conditions called malignant wind with lumbar pain and leg weakness.

The Four Agents with *Aconite* Decoction treats wind-damp confluence with painful, restless joints, limb spasms, inability to flex or extend, pain upon touch, spontaneous sweating with shortness of breath, scant urination, aversion to wind with reluctance to remove clothing, or intermittent facial, hand, and foot swelling:

Two *Aconite* tubers, four *liang* of cinnamon bark, three *liang* of *Atractylodes*, and two *liang* of licorice. The four ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in six *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses; mild sweating brings resolution, while profuse sweating with vexation warrants reducing to five *ge* per dose. For body swelling, add four *liang* of *Stephania*; for palpitations and scant urination, add three *liang* of *Poria*. Given the presence of *Aconite*, now add three *liang* of fresh ginger.

To treat excess *foot-qi* wind-toxin, Lingnan miasmic *qi* with facial swelling, alternating cold and heat resembling malaria, leg swelling, *qi* ascending to the heart with oppression, cough, flaccid paralysis, and stubborn impediment:

**Hemp Seed Decoction**
Hemp seeds, *Cimicifuga*, ephedra, *Belamcanda*, *Acorus*, mirabilite, licorice, and rhubarb—each half a *liang*; fermented soybeans, three *ge*. These nine ingredients are to be broken up, then decocted in six *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain. Add the mirabilite and boil three more times.

For scant urination, substitute red *Poria* for *Poria* spirit and add three *liang* of *Atractylodes*. For pronounced heat, add one *liang* of scutellaria. For enuresis, add twenty *Mantis Egg-Cases*.

*Hu Qia’s Formula* omits astragalus, *Cistanche*, red halloysite, *Lycium* root bark, magnetite, unripe bitter orange, *Saposhnikovia*, dragon bone, and pinellia, but includes scutellaria, totaling fifteen ingredients.

This formula, used by Zhi Facun of the South, proved highly effective—gentle yet potent, surpassing *Continuing Life Decoction*, *Maidservant Decoction*, and *Wind-Drawing Decoction*. The Lu family of Guangzhou and scholars of Nanzhou commonly employed it. It also excels in treating severe *foot* weakness. The formula is as follows:

For the first dose, cover the patient thickly to induce slight sweating, and expect two or three bouts of diarrhea. Administer subsequent doses at intervals equivalent to the time it takes a person to walk ten *li*. For fever, add two *liang* of rhubarb. For those with preexisting cold-induced heart pain, double the tangkuei and add three *liang* of cinnamon bark, omitting rhubarb.

**Formulas for Wind-Toxin Foot *Qi* – Third of the Various Powder Formulas**

As a general principle, powders are most suitable for administration in spring and autumn.

**Eight-Wind Powder**
The *Eight-Wind Powder* treats wind deficiency with a dark, earthen complexion, inability to endure exposure to sunlight or moonlight, and foot *qi* with numbness and weakness. According to the classics, a dark complexion pertains to the kidneys, while inability to endure sunlight or moonlight pertains to the liver. Thus, this formula supplements the kidneys and treats the liver:

Three *liang* of chrysanthemum flower; one and a half *liang* each of dendrobium and aconite; one *liang* and six *zhu* each of ginseng, prepared aconite, and licorice; one *liang* each of stalactite, Chinese yam, dipsacus, astragalus, alisma, ophiopogon, polygala, asarum, gentian, pyrrosia, cuscuta, achyranthes, calamus, eucommia, poria, dried rehmannia, biota seed, cnidium, saposhnikovia, atractylodes, dried ginger, tokoro, and cornus; half a *liang* each of schisandra and aconite; two *liang* of cistanche.

The above thirty-three ingredients are to be ground and sifted. Take one square-inch spoonful with wine, three times daily. If ineffective, increase to two spoonfuls.

**Major Eight-Wind Powder**
The *Major Eight-Wind Powder* treats various types of flaccid wind-dampness impediment with weak feet. The formula is as follows:

Half a *liang* each of morinda root, astragalus, cinnamon bark, asarum, aconite, tokoro, cistanche, vitex seed, Chinese yam, chrysanthemum flower, Solomon’s seal, cornus, gentian, scutellaria, dendrobium, atractylodes, *yu* stone (also written as alum), magnolia bark, gentian, ginseng, and Sichuan pepper; eighteen *zhu* each of prepared aconite and schisandra; one *liang* each of calamus, poria, achyranthes (in the *Supplement to the Thousand Golden Remedies*, dried ginger), wolfsbane, and polygala; thirty *zhu* of platycodon; six *zhu* each of ligusticum, ampelopsis, and peony.

The above thirty-two ingredients are to be ground and sifted.

Take with wine half a *cun*-spoonful, three times daily; if ineffective, gradually increase the dose until a slight sensation is felt. The *Hu Qia* version omits platycodon.

**Internal-Tonifying Dendrobium and Gentian Powder**
This formula treats wind-induced vacuity with weak feet, clenched hands and feet, painful impediment preventing walking, swelling of the instep ascending to the knees, and a hard lower abdomen as if bound by rope. Patients experience constant sighing as if vexed and are unable to eat or drink. These symptoms arise from the five taxations and seven damages, kidney qi insufficiency, and contraction of wind-dampness. This formula governs all such cases:

One *liang* each of dendrobium, prepared aconite, aconite, cinnamon bark, *du huo*, and asparagus root; thirty *zhu* each of gentian, aconite, ginseng, dried ginger, tangkuei, *fangfeng*, and eucommia; eighteen *zhu* each of cornus, *mang cao*, platycodon, asarum, ephedra, and *qian hu*; half a *liang* each of Sichuan pepper, angelica, and atractylodes.

The above twenty-three ingredients are to be ground and sifted. Take one *cun*-spoonful with wine, twice daily; if ineffective, gradually increase to two spoonfuls. For those with vacuity, roast the three *aconites*; for those with repletion, they may also be used raw.

Wind qi fundamentally arises from kidney vacuity. After contracting the illness, if toxic qi fills the exterior, moxibustion may drain the qi; if it fills the interior, medicinals may hasten its resolution. Such measures are necessary for urgent relief. Once the wind recedes and the four limbs are weak, with residual toxins yet unexpelled, treatment must not cease. This powder should be taken to expel the old and usher in the new—it is most excellent. This is readily understood and leaves no room for doubt.

**Gentian Powder**
This formula treats wind, whether chronic or acute, sudden loss of consciousness, lack of sensation in the four limbs, generalized pain, hemiplegia with immobility, inability to flex or extend, alternating chills and fever, dizziness or fainting, or facial distortion:

One *liang* each of gentian, dried ginger, platycodon, and prepared aconite; ten *zhu* each of aconite, tangkuei, asparagus root, ginseng, atractylodes, and Sichuan pepper; eighteen *zhu* each of aconite and asarum; half a *liang* each of licorice, angelica, cornus, ephedra, *qian hu*, *fangfeng*, and schisandra.

The above nineteen ingredients are to be ground and sifted. Take one *cun*-spoonful with wine, three times daily; the elderly should take a smaller dose. The *Hu Qia* version omits asparagus root and *qian hu*, but includes *mang cao*, cinnamon bark, *fang ji*, tokoro, ampelopsis, and astragalus, totaling twenty-three ingredients.

**Single-Ingredient Pine Resin Formula**
This treats all wind conditions, including *great wind*, weak feet, and wind impediment. The method for *frankincense* is the same:

Take thirty *jin* of pine resin, place it in a bag made of palm fiber, and tie the opening. Arrange bamboo or wood at the bottom of a cauldron, place the bag on top, and weigh it down with three to five stones. Fill the cauldron with water and boil. Once the resin floats to the surface and is fully extracted, continue boiling for another twenty cycles. Remove and place in cold water, then replace the bag and wash the pot before boiling again. Repeat this process nine times. Once the medicine is prepared, pound and sift it, then pass it through a coarse sieve.

Take one *cun*-spoonful with wine, twice daily. Initially, mix the medicine with cold wine; after it enters the abdomen, drink warm wine to activate the medicine, adjusting the dose based on sensation. If heat is felt, reduce the amount; failure to do so may cause constipation or urinary difficulty. If blockage occurs, consume scallion broth. If still obstructed, take fresh rehmannia juice to induce mild diarrhea. Avoid only hemp seeds; no other restrictions apply.

To abstain from grains, add an equal part of poria to the pine resin and form into pills with honey. Consume only plain wheat noodles twice daily, one small bowl per meal—do not overeat.

**Method for Preparing Noodles:**
Knead the dough firmly while hot, boil for fifty cycles, then rinse in cold water. Return to boiling water for another ten cycles before removing and consuming.

After thirty days of taking pine resin, efficacy will be evident when a sensation akin to water flowing down the legs is felt. To prevent constipation, mix one *jin* of pine resin and poria with dates or chestnuts the size of a jujube, then fry in *su*—this will prevent blockage. After one hundred days, *leg qi* should resolve.

The *Immortal Classic* states: Taking pine resin for one year adds one year to one’s lifespan; two years adds two years. Taking it for ten years adds ten years to one’s lifespan.

**Huainan Eight Lords Dendrobium Powder for Myriad Diseases**
This formula treats wind-dampness pain and immobility of the lower back and feet:

The above twenty-seven ingredients are to be ground and sifted. Take one *cun*-spoonful with wine, twice daily.

**Cornus Powder**
This formula treats cold wind, lame feet, hemiplegia, half-body immobility, and incessant groaning—conditions deemed untreatable by physicians:

Half a *liang* each of evodia fruit, dried ginger, ampelopsis, *mu jing* (in the *Supplement to the Thousand Golden Remedies*, *mu gui*), prepared aconite, aconite, *gou ji*, dried lacquer, Chinese yam, gentian, and *fangfeng*.

The above eleven ingredients are to be ground and sifted. Take one *cun*-spoonful before meals, three times daily. A tingling sensation will spread through the skin and flesh within three days; recovery occurs within one month.

A formula for treating bone marrow pain and wind afflicting the five viscera:
One set of tiger bones, roasted over charcoal until yellow, then pounded, scraped, and ground for several days. Steep in six *sheng* of clear wine for five nights. Drink gradually as desired.

The *Yi* states: "When the tiger roars, wind arises; when the dragon hums, clouds gather." This reflects the resonance between the sentient and insentient, ensuring the efficacy of wind treatments without doubt.

**Smartweed Wine**

Place in a copper vessel, simmer over water in a large cauldron to reduce to three *dou* and five *sheng*. The method for simmering all ingredients follows the *wujia* example.

The above five ingredients—*baizhu* and the rest—yield a total of nine *dou* and five *sheng* of juice. Take one *shi* and five *dou* of glutinous rice and eight *jin* of wheat *qu*, dry in the sun, and grind to powder. Soak the *qu* in six *dou* of the medicinal juice for five days until the *qu* ferments. For the first addition, wash and rinse seven *dou* of rice thirty times, place on a clean mat, and wipe with a raw cloth to ensure cleanliness. Steam the rice, then soak the cooked grains in the remaining medicinal juice, adjusting the consistency before steaming again. When a crust forms on the grains, spread them on a mat, adjusting the consistency, temperature, and moisture as in standard wine brewing. Ferment in a jar, sealing the lid tightly. After three days, make the second addition: wash and rinse four *dou* of rice as before, then add following the same method. After another three days, add the following ingredients:

*Guixin*, *gancao*, *baizhi*, *xixin*, *fangfeng*, *danggui*, *mahuang*, *xiongqiong* (6 *liang* each); *fuzi* (5 *liang*); *niuxi* (9 *liang*); *ganjiang*, *wujia pi* (1 *jin* each).

Cut the above twelve ingredients, then for the third addition, wash and rinse four *dou* of rice as before. Soak the cooked grains in the remaining juice, steam again until a crust forms, then spread on a mat, adjusting temperature and moisture as in standard brewing. Combine with the above ingredients, and after three more days, taste for a balanced sweetness and bitterness. Seal tightly for fourteen days, then press to obtain the clear wine.

Take four *ge* per dose, twice daily, gradually increasing until the desired effect is achieved. The wine should be warmed but not excessively hot. Avoid raw or cold foods, vinegar, slippery textures, pork, carp, garlic, beef, and the like.

**Pine Needle Wine**, which governs weakness of the legs, the twelve types of wind-induced paralysis rendering one unable to walk: After taking several doses of *Gengsheng San* and other treatments prove ineffective, a single dose of this formula enables long-distance walking. No more than two doses are required. **Method**:
Sixty *jin* of pine needles, cut and boiled in four *shi* of water to yield four *dou* and nine *sheng*. Use this to brew five *dou* of rice following standard methods. Separately boil the pine needle decoction to soak the rice and cook the grains. Seal the vessel with clay for fermentation. After seven days, the wine will activate; strain and drink to intoxication. Many have gained strength from this, and its efficacy is divine.

**Formula for Beriberi**:
Three *dou* of fine fermented soybeans, steamed with one *shi* of rice, then sun-dried. Repeat this process three times. Soak in five *dou* of wine for seven days, then strain and drink to intoxication. When the wine is finished, soak the residue again in two and a half *dou* of wine and drink as before.

**Aconite Wine**, a formula for wind-dampness paralysis, numbness, and leg weakness rendering one unable to walk:

**On Remedies for Various Wind Disorders**
*Discourse on Miscellaneous Wind Conditions, First Section*

Qibo said: The great principles of wind-stroke comprise four types—first, *pianku* (hemiplegia); second, *fengfei* (wind-paralysis); third, *fengyi* (wind-stupor); and fourth, *fengbi* (wind-arthralgia).

Most acute and sudden illnesses arise from wind. When first contracted, its symptoms are mild and often unnoticed; one should swiftly administer *Xuming Decoction* and apply moxibustion to the transport points. Wind is the chief of the hundred diseases. The four types Qibo describes are the most severe.

*Pianku* (hemiplegia) manifests as unilateral paralysis, with one side of the body immobile and painful, though speech remains intact and cognition unimpaired. The disorder lies between the *fen* and *sheng* (nutritive and defensive qi). Treatment involves warming the patient to induce sweating, supplementing deficiency and reducing excess—only then may recovery occur. The *Jia Yi Jing* states: To induce sweating through warming, apply moxibustion at *Ju* points.

*Fengfei* (wind-paralysis) presents with no bodily pain, but the limbs are flaccid and unresponsive. If cognitive impairment is mild and speech remains somewhat intelligible, the condition is treatable; if speech is entirely lost, it is incurable.

*Fengyi* (wind-stupor) involves sudden loss of recognition, throat obstruction with a stifled sensation (the *Chao Yuan* describes it as a rasping sound), and stiff tongue rendering speech impossible. The disorder originates in the viscera, first entering *yin* and then *yang*. Treatment begins with supplementing *yin*, followed by draining *yang*, and inducing sweating. If the body becomes supple, the patient may live; if sweating fails and the body remains rigid, death occurs within seven days. The *Chao Yuan* states: If the area beneath the eyes and the sides of the philtrum appear white, the condition is treatable; if one side is black and the other red, with foaming at the mouth, it is incurable.

*Fengbi* (wind-arthralgia), *shibi* (damp-arthralgia), *zhoubi* (generalized arthralgia), *jinbi* (sinew-arthralgia), *maibi* (vessel-arthralgia), *jibi* (muscle-arthralgia), *pibi* (skin-arthralgia), *gubi* (bone-arthralgia), and *baobi* (bladder-arthralgia) each exhibit distinct symptoms resembling wind disorders, differentiated by their pulses. A faint and rough pulse indicates numbness throughout the body.

Wind generally invades through the back, penetrating the five viscera. Among the viscera, the lungs are most urgently affected, for they govern respiration and envelop all other organs.

**Lung-Wind:**
The patient lies supine with fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, dizziness, and sweating—these are signs of lung-wind. If the area beneath the eyes and alongside the nose down to the mouth appears white, the condition is treatable. Urgently apply moxibustion at the lung transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*; reduce the dosage for children. If the color is yellow, the lungs are already damaged, transforming into blood—recovery is impossible. The patient will rave, pluck at the air, point at the ground, or fumble with their clothes; death follows within days. If struck by violent wind-evil, the patient becomes disoriented, raves incoherently, or grows faint and unable to speak. Without immediate treatment, death occurs swiftly. At the first sign, apply moxibustion to the lung, diaphragm, and liver transport points (several dozen cones) and urgently administer *Xuming Decoction*—this may save them. If saliva or spittle flows uncontrollably, combine moxibustion with the decoction.

When wind invades the *yang* channels, symptoms resemble lung-wind—disorientation and raving—but the onset is gradual, and death may be prolonged.

**Liver-Wind:**
The patient sits hunched and cannot lower their head. A faint greenish hue surrounds the eyes and extends to the forehead—this is liver-wind. If the lips are green and the face yellow, the condition is treatable. Urgently apply moxibustion at the liver transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*. If the color deepens to dark green-black, with the face alternating between yellow and white, the liver is already damaged—recovery is impossible, and death follows within days.

**Heart-Wind:**
The patient can only lie supine, unable to turn to either side, with oppression, confusion, and profuse sweating—these are signs of heart-wind. If the lips remain a proper red, the condition is treatable. Urgently apply moxibustion at the heart transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*. If the lips turn green, white, yellow, or black, the heart has deteriorated into water. If the face and eyes appear swollen and twitch intermittently, recovery is impossible—death occurs within five or six days (some texts say ten days).

**Spleen-Wind:**
The patient sits hunched with abdominal fullness, the body turning uniformly yellow, and vomits salty fluid—this is treatable. Urgently apply moxibustion at the gallbladder transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*. If the area beneath the eyes and the limbs turn green, recovery is impossible.

**Kidney-Wind:**
The patient sits hunched with lumbar pain. If yellow patches the size of a cake appear on either side of the flanks, the condition is treatable. Urgently apply moxibustion at the kidney transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*. If the teeth turn yellow-red, the temples stiffen, and the face takes on an earthen hue, recovery is impossible.

**Large Intestine-Wind:**
The patient lies with incessant intestinal rumbling. Apply moxibustion at the large intestine transport point (one hundred cones) and administer *Xuming Decoction*.

When pernicious wind-evil invades, it first harms *yang*, attacking the exterior and lodging in the skin. From there, it transmits to the *sun* vessels; when these are full, it moves to the *luo* vessels, and when those are full, it enters the major channels, forming disease. If it reaches the six *fu* organs, it generates heat. If it does not resolve externally, the patient may weep or wail. A firm, large pulse indicates repletion—externally, the body feels hard and full, tender to the touch, and painful when pressed.

The collateral branches of the channels and network vessels are all *sun* vessels.

Wind’s harm to humans may manifest as cold-stroke, heat-stroke, *lifeng* (leprosy), *pianku* (hemiplegia), or pernicious wind. Thus, wind injury in spring (days *jia-yi*) affects the liver; in summer (days *bing-ding*), the heart; in the four seasons (days *wu-ji*), the spleen; in autumn (days *geng-xin*), the lungs; and in winter (days *ren-gui*), the kidneys.

Wind invading the transport points of the five viscera and six *fu* organs becomes visceral wind, entering through their respective portals to cause *pianfeng* (unilateral wind). When wind ascends along *Fengfu* (Wind Mansion), it becomes *naofeng* (brain-wind). Wind entering the head causes *mufeng* (eye-wind) with cold eyes. Wind contracted after drinking alcohol becomes *jiufeng* (wine-wind).

Entering the bedchamber while sweating and struck by wind becomes *neifeng* (internal wind). Newly washed and struck by wind becomes *shoufeng* (head-wind). Long-standing wind entering the bedchamber and struck by wind becomes *changfeng* (intestinal wind). When wind lodges in the interstices of the exterior, it becomes *xiefeng* (effusing wind). Thus it is said: wind is the chief of the hundred diseases. As for its transformations, it may become other illnesses, without fixed pattern.

Know this: wind moves swiftly and changes frequently. When it lingers in human flesh, neither discharging internally nor dispersing externally, it alters its nature in accordance with the person’s activity or stillness. Wind encountering cold prevents food from descending; encountering heat causes the flesh to waste and induces alternating chills and fever. Wind meeting exuberant yang prevents sweating; meeting exuberant yin causes spontaneous sweating.

In the corpulent, wind lodges in thick flesh and is difficult to discharge, readily causing *rezhong* (heat-stroke) with yellowed eyes. In the lean, wind lingers in thin flesh, often causing external sweating, internal cold, and weeping eyes. When wind encounters vacuity and the interstices open, it exits externally, producing a chilled sensation as if cold, with the body feeling as if drenched by water, or at times like the sound of bamboo pipes being blown—these are its signs. When wind encounters repletion and the interstices close, it lurks internally, causing heat and oppression—these are its signs.

Eating a meal and then being struck by wind becomes *wei feng* (stomach wind), its signs being aversion to wind, profuse sweating in the neck, blockage below the diaphragm, inability to ingest food or drink, distention and fullness, emaciation, abdominal swelling, and when clothing is removed, a sensation of fullness and oppression; eating cold food induces watery diarrhea.

Eating hot food and then immersing oneself in water or bathing causes the abdomen to swell into *shuibing* (water disease). Becoming drunk and then struck by wind becomes *loufeng* (leaking wind), its signs being aversion to wind, copious sweating, shortness of breath, dry mouth with thirst, and when near clothing, the body feels as if scorched by fire; when approaching food, sweat streams like rain, joints become slack, and one is disinclined to exertion.

Newly washing and bathing and then struck by wind becomes *shoufeng* (head-wind), its signs being aversion to wind, sweating, and frequent headaches. Newly engaging in bedroom activities and then struck by wind becomes *neifeng* (internal wind), its signs being aversion to wind and sweat soaking the clothes.

*Laofeng* (taxation wind) lodges below the lungs, causing stiffness in the upper body and eyes to protrude, spittle like mucus, aversion to wind, and shivering with cold. If after three or five days the eyes lack clarity, this is the sign; by seven or eight days, a slight yellow-green pus like a pellet may emerge from the mouth or nose—this is favorable. If it does not emerge, the lungs are injured.

When wind evil lodges in the flesh, vacuity and itching develop into *fengzhen* (wind papules), painful sores. When wind evil penetrates deeply and cold and heat contend, the flesh withers. When evil lodges in half the body and penetrates deeply, true qi departs, causing *pianku* (hemiplegia). When evil lodges in the joints, spasms occur; the same happens when it enters the sinews.

When evil encroaches upon the viscera, one dreams of the viscera being large and the body small; when it encroaches upon the *fu* organs, one dreams of the viscera being small and the body large. When evil follows the ocular connections into the brain, the eyes spin and become dizzy. When evil strikes the pupils, vision scatters and one sees double.

When wind evil enters the viscera and cold qi lodges within, failing to effuse, it causes aphonia, abscesses, throat impediment, and slack tongue. If not treated promptly with medicinals or acupuncture, wind follows the vessels into the viscera, causing sudden block, slackness, lockjaw, convulsions, and death.

Wind entering the yang channels causes mania; entering the yin channels causes epilepsy. Yang evil entering yin causes quiet illness; yin evil entering yang causes rage.

If after eating hot food or sweating in a bath the interstices open and wind naturally departs, one feels as if needles are pricking the flesh. Walking or exerting oneself to induce sweating produces the same sensation. Whenever the flesh feels as if pricked, it is due to the interstices closing and evil qi being trapped within, attempting to exit—resolving the flesh with decoction is beneficial.

Twitching eyelids, quivering lips, or wry mouth are all due to wind entering the vessels; one should promptly take *Xiao Xuming Tang* (Minor Continued Life Decoction), apply *Bafeng San* (Eight-Wind Powder), massage with *Shenming Baifu Gao* (Divine Clarity White Paste) and *Danshen Gao* (Red Sage Paste), and follow the channels in acupuncture.

All block syndromes arise from the three qi of wind, cold, and dampness lodging together in the interstices of the flesh, pressing and cutting to form foam. When cold is encountered, it congeals; congealing, it displaces the flesh, causing fissures and pain. Pain draws the spirit, and the spirit’s arrival generates heat; heat resolves the pain, and pain’s resolution causes reversal. Reversal triggers other block syndromes, which arise in this manner. Here, the illness is neither internal in the viscera nor external on the skin but resides in the interstices of the flesh, where true qi cannot circulate—thus it becomes block.

When wind predominates, numbness and swelling become *xingbi* (migratory block), wandering without fixed location. When cold predominates, it becomes *tongbi* (painful block). When dampness predominates, it becomes *zhuobi* (fixed block). Cold sweat and dampness that follow the blood vessels up and down but cannot move left or right become *zhoubi* (generalized block). When block is in the flesh, it arises and ceases intermittently, responding on the left to the left and on the right to the right—this is *pianbi* (unilateral block).

In block syndromes, when yang qi is scant and yin qi abundant, the body feels cold emanating from within. When yang qi is abundant and yin qi scant, block is accompanied by heat. All block syndromes where wind predominates are easily cured; those in the skin are also easily cured, but those in the sinews and bones are difficult to heal. Long-standing block penetrating deeply causes the construction and defense to become rough, the channels and network vessels to become sparse, and pain to go unnoticed.

Incurable wind-block disease causes the feet to feel as if treading on ice, at times as if entering boiling water, with the abdomen and thighs experiencing a flowing sensation, vexation, heart pain, and headache—injuring the spleen and kidneys. At times there is vomiting and dizziness, spontaneous sweating—injuring the heart. Dizziness injures the liver.

Grief and fear, shortness of breath, and melancholy injure the lungs; death occurs within three years. Some say within three days.

When taiyang is struck by wind and further assailed by cold-damp, it transforms into tetany. Tetany manifests as clenched jaw, stiff and rigid back resembling epilepsy—shaking the head, neighing like a horse, opisthotonos, with attacks occurring ten times in quick succession, breath nearly ceasing, sweat pouring like rain, and occasional collapse. Those easily afflicted include newly delivered women, those with incised wounds and blood depletion, infants with umbilical wind, and adults struck by cold-damp tetanic wind—all such cases are fatal. Febrile diseases with intense heat entering the kidneys, as well as childhood epilepsy with intense heat, may also present as tetany. Tetany, aphasia, reversal, and epilepsy share similarities, so long-standing reversal may develop into epilepsy—careful examination is required.

In severe cases, there is sharp pain in the ears, indicating wind entering the kidney channel. If left untreated, it flows into the kidneys, causing sudden body tetany and rigidity resembling death. In all such cases, two or three doses of Minor Continued Life Decoction should be administered. If there is ear pain, swelling, suppuration, or abscess formation, it is not harmful; only wind should be guarded against. Acupuncture at the anterior ear artery and Wind Mansion is highly effective.

Treats sudden wind stroke with near-death, body flaccidity or rigidity, facial distortion, stiff tongue with inability to speak, stupor, and mental confusion. Effective for all wind conditions without causing depletion.

*Ingredients:*
Ephedra, *fangji* (*Cui’s* and *Waitai* versions omit ginseng and scutellaria), cinnamon twig, licorice, peony, *chuanxiong*, apricot kernel—each one *liang*; ledebouriella root one and a half *liang*; aconite one piece; fresh ginger five *liang*.

Twelve ingredients in total. Chop, then decoct in twelve *sheng* of water. First boil ephedra three times, skim off foam, add remaining ingredients, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. If unresolved, prepare three or four more doses—highly effective. To induce sweating, adjust according to the patient’s wind severity, deficiency, or excess.

One case of foot weakness was cured after six or seven doses. For those with wind rashes, preparing this decoction at the onset of weather changes can prevent aphasia.

*Variant:* For disorientation, add *fuling* and *yuanzhi*. For bone and joint pain with underlying heat, omit aconite and double the peony.

*The Small Essentials*, *Supplement to the Thousand Gold Pieces*, and others concur. *Master Shen’s* and *Ancient and Modern Records of Proven Formulas* include white wood but omit apricot kernel. *Emergency Remedies* omits *chuanxiong* and apricot kernel, totaling ten ingredients. *Extended Years* omits ledebouriella.

**Minor Continued Life Decoction**
Treats wind stroke with clouded senses, unlocalized pain, spasms preventing turning, limb flaccidity or rigidity, and incontinence. Similar to Major Continued Life Decoction, but particularly suited for postpartum blood loss and the elderly or young.

*Ingredients:*
Ephedra, cinnamon twig, licorice—each two *liang*; fresh ginger five *liang*; ginseng, *chuanxiong*, white atractylodes (previous formula includes apricot kernel), aconite, *fangji*, peony, scutellaria—each one *liang*; ledebouriella one and a half *liang*.

Twelve ingredients in total. Chop, decoct in twelve *sheng* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

*Ancient and Modern Records of Proven Formulas* omits cinnamon twig, naming it Continued Life Decoction. *Hu Qia’s* and *Supplement to the Thousand Gold Pieces* versions are identical.

**Another Formula**
Treats wind enduring for years, with symptoms such as singing, weeping, or uncontrollable laughter, and incoherent speech.

*Ingredients:*
Ephedra three *liang*; ginseng, cinnamon twig, white atractylodes—each two *liang*; *chuanxiong*, licorice, *fangji*, scutellaria, peony, tangkuei—each two *liang*.

Ten ingredients in total. Chop, decoct in twelve *sheng* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, taken thrice daily. Cover to induce sweating.

**Major Continued Life Decoction**
Treats liver wind with sudden aphonia, following ancient methods using both Major and Minor Continued Life Decoctions to address five-viscera hemiplegia and pernicious wind.

*Ingredients:*
Ephedra eight *liang*; gypsum four *liang*; cinnamon twig, dried ginger, *chuanxiong*—each two *liang*; tangkuei, scutellaria—each one *liang*; apricot kernel thirty pieces; *jing* juice one *sheng*.

Nine ingredients in total. Chop, decoct in ten *sheng* of water. First boil ephedra twice, skim off foam, add remaining ingredients, and reduce to four *sheng*. Strain, then add *jing* juice and boil briefly. Divide into four doses. If speech returns but recovery is incomplete, follow with Minor Continued Life Decoction.

Originally without *jing* juice; now added, its efficacy is divine. *Supplement to the Thousand Gold Pieces* includes licorice.

**Another Formula**
Treats severe wind penetrating the viscera, with sudden inability to speak, dragging limbs, and unnoticed skin pain or itching.

*Ingredients:*
*Du huo*, ephedra—each three *liang*; *chuanxiong*, ledebouriella, tangkuei, pueraria, fresh ginger, cinnamon twig, *fuling*, aconite, asarum, licorice—each one *liang*.

Twelve ingredients in total. Chop, decoct in twelve *sheng* of water, and reduce to four *sheng*. Divide into five doses; halve for the elderly or young.

If profuse sweating occurs at onset, reduce ephedra; if no sweating, follow the original formula. For counterflow qi, add two *liang* of evodia and one *liang* of magnolia bark. For dry retching, add one *liang* of aconite. For hiccups, add two *liang* of tangerine peel. For shortness of breath, add twelve jujubes. For palpitations, add one *liang* of *zexie*. For heat, omit fresh ginger and add pueraria.

Upon initial wind onset, do not modify—prepare three doses first. After four or five days, reassess deficiency or excess, then administer decoction or acupuncture, moxibustion at appropriate points.

**Another Formula**
Same as the previous Major Continued Life Decoction, suitable for postpartum women, the elderly, and children.

**Ephedra and Chuanxiong Decoction**
Ephedra (3 *liang*), chuanxiong (3 *liang*), dried ginger (2 *liang*), gypsum (2 *liang*), ginseng (2 *liang*), Chinese angelica (2 *liang*), cinnamon bark (2 *liang*), licorice (2 *liang*), apricot kernels (40 pieces). Chop these nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

*The Outer Canon* calls this Continued Life Decoction; *Fan Wang’s* text concurs, noting it as Zhang Zhongjing’s formula but missing two ingredients.

**Xizhou Continued Life Decoction**
For wind-stroke paralysis (or "entering the viscera"), where the body cannot move itself, speech fails, consciousness is clouded, the patient does not recognize others, limbs are rigid, the back aches, and turning is impossible:
Ephedra (6 *liang*), gypsum (4 *liang*), cinnamon bark (2 *liang*), licorice (1 *liang*), chuanxiong (1 *liang*), dried ginger (1 *liang*), scutellaria (1 *liang*), Chinese angelica (1 *liang*), apricot kernels (30 pieces). Chop these nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* and two *sheng* of water. Boil ephedra twice, skim off the foam, then add the remaining ingredients and reduce to four *sheng*.

Take one *sheng* initially. If the patient remains conscious, avoid deep sleep; cover warmly to induce slight sweating, then gradually remove layers. Do not over-cover, and allow rest once sweating begins. If no sweat appears after the first dose, take another *sheng* to induce sweating. Subsequent doses may be reduced to five *ge* each, taken at intervals until recovery. Do not take all at once—sweating signals cure, and no further doses are needed. Eat normally without restrictions, but avoid wind. This also treats counterflow qi and cough.

For severe facial and eye swelling with inability to sit up, this decoction is highly effective. If the decoction fails to descend, blow on the patient’s back to aid its passage. Those with prior cold sweats should not take this. For the frail, administer only five *ge* per dose.

Some have mistakenly given this decoction to postpartum women or the weak in a single dose of two *sheng*, often resulting in death due to excessive volume or turbid preparation. If the decoction is clear and taken gradually to induce mild sweating, no harm occurs.

*The Hu Qie Formula* and *Ancient and Modern Proven Remedies* call this Major Continued Life Decoction.

Divide into three doses, taken daily without interruption. Avoid wind and cold—highly effective.

I once suffered wind-stroke with slurred speech and dragging limbs. Taking four doses of this formula daily for ten days and nights without interruption, I recovered.

Moxibustion methods:
Bian Que states: For sudden affliction by malign wind, heart vexation, and deadly distress, immediately moxa the transverse crease below the big toe, with cones corresponding to the patient’s age—recovery is immediate. If sinews are tense and walking is impossible, for inner ankle tension, moxa fourty cones above the inner ankle; for outer ankle tension, moxa thirty cones above the outer ankle—recovery is immediate. If the eyes are fixed upward, moxa twenty cones behind the outer canthi of both eyes. If unable to speak, moxa one hundred cones on the third vertebra. If unable to recognize people, moxa seven cones at the tip of the floating ribs. If the eyes are inverted, the jaw clenched, and the abdomen acutely painful, moxa fourteen cones on the first transverse crease below the scrotum. This is also effective for sudden death.

For chronic wind, sudden wind, and all wind conditions—whether flaccid or tense—with sudden onset and loss of awareness, or symptoms such as abdominal distension, hemiplegia, clenched jaw, drooling, closed eyes, deafness, generalized cold rigidity, vexation, confusion, mood swings, cyanotic lips, pale mouth, upward-staring eyes, or opisthotonos: at the first sign of onset, moxa seven cones at *Shenting* (one point, located directly above the nose at the hairline). Next, moxa seven cones at *Quchai* (two points, each one and a half *cun* lateral to *Shenting*). Next, moxa seven cones at *Shangguan* (two points, also called *Kezhuren*, located in the depression above the upper border of the zygomatic arch in front of the ear). Next, moxa seven cones at *Xiaguan* (two points, located in the depression below the lower border of the zygomatic arch in front of the ear). Next, moxa seven cones at *Jiache* (two points, located in the depression of the cheek). Next, moxa seven cones at *Lianquan* (one point, located in the depression directly below the chin). Next, moxa seven cones at *Xinhui* (one point, located two *cun* above *Shenting*). Next, moxa seven cones at *Baihui* (one point, located at the vertex of the head). Next, moxa seven cones at *Benshen* (two points, located two *fen* directly above the ear within the hairline; alternatively, four *fen*). Next, moxa seven cones at *Tianzhu* (two points, located in the depression lateral to the two large sinews at the nape, within the hairline). Next, moxa seven cones at *Taodao* (one point, located in the depression below the *Dazhui* vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Fengmen* (two points, located one and a half *cun* lateral to the second vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Xinshu* (two points, located one and a half *cun* lateral to the fifth vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Ganshu* (two points, located one and a half *cun* lateral to the ninth vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Shenshu* (two points, located one and a half *cun* lateral to the fourteenth vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Pangguangshu* (two points, located one and a half *cun* lateral to the nineteenth vertebra). Next, moxa seven cones at *Quchi* (two points, located in the depression at the lateral end of the elbow crease when flexed). Next, moxa seven cones at *Jianyu* (two points, located in the depression between the two bones at the top of the shoulder). Next, moxa seven cones at *Zhigou* (two points, located three *cun* proximal to the wrist crease on the dorsal forearm). Next, moxa seven cones at *Hegu* (two points, located in the depression between the first and second metacarpal bones). Next, moxa seven cones at *Jianshi* (two points, located three *cun* proximal to the wrist crease between the two tendons). Next, moxa seven cones at *Yanglingquan* (two points, located in the depression anterior to the head of the fibula). Next, moxa seven cones at *Yangfu* (two points, located in the depression at the distal end of the fibula). Next, moxa seven cones at *Kunlun* (two points, located in the depression posterior to the lateral malleolus).

For wind conditions, moxa two hundred cones at *Shangxing* and *Baihui*, two hundred forty cones at *Qianding*, and three hundred cones at *Naohu* and *Fengfu*.

One tradition states: For severe wind conditions, moxa *Baihui* with seven hundred cones. For all varieties of wind, moxa the two points located bilaterally on the nape, level with *Dazhui*, measuring two *cun* and three *fen* apart—using the patient’s finger *cun* for measurement—with one hundred cones applied to each side until soreness is felt.

For wind conditions and tinnitus, measure eight and a half *fen* inward from behind the ear, where a foramen is found; moxibustion here cures all wind disorders and brings relief. It also cures madness. Moxa one hundred cones at points both anterior and posterior to each ear.

For sudden onset of severe wind aversion, near-death inability to speak, or flesh numbness with loss of consciousness, moxa the fifth vertebra, called *Zangshu*, with one hundred fifty cones, increasing to three hundred cones for resolution. The *Xinshu* point lies at the fifth vertebral node—some say the seventh—aligned horizontally with the heart at three *cun* intervals. It governs heart wind, abdominal distension and fullness, undigested food, hematemesis, acid reflux, emaciation of the limbs, loss of appetite, epistaxis, blurred or unclear vision, pain in the shoulders and flanks, lower abdominal tension. Moxa two to three hundred cones here.

The *Dachangshu* points lie on either side of the sixteenth vertebra, one and a half *cun* apart. They govern wind, borborygmus, intestinal spasms with diarrhea, undigested food, lower abdominal colic, lumbar and spinal stiffness, difficulty with urination or defecation, and loss of appetite. Moxa one hundred cones, repeating every three days.

*Yemen* is located one *cun* within the axillary hairline, also called *Taiyangyin* or *Yejian*. Moxa fifty cones here for wind conditions. *Juegu* lies three *cun* above the lateral malleolus. Moxa one hundred cones to treat wind, bodily heaviness, heart vexation, and leg meridian pain.

It is said: If *li jie* wind lingers untreated, it causes the bones and joints to dislocate, transforming into *dian* disease—this must not be overlooked. From ancient times to the present, regardless of status, many suffer from it; this is the harm wrought by wind’s toxicity. Though treatments include decoctions, none surpass *song gao* (pine resin) or *song jie jiu* (pine node wine).

Simply moxa the painful area with three sets of seven cones for excellent results.

**Formula for Severe Wind (Wei Tui Feng), Hemiplegia, Loss of Speech, and Aphasia:**
- Apricot kernels (remove double kernels and skins/tips): 3 *dou*
  Wash, pound in a mortar to 2 *dou* until crushed, then grind to the consistency of cold-food porridge. Extract 8 *sheng* of juice, decoct to 4 *sheng*. Taste for a fragrant, smooth texture—this indicates readiness. If not, it is undercooked; thorough cooking is essential. Allow to cool completely, then add 1 *dou* and 6 *sheng* of fine yeast. Decoct to 8 *sheng* for the first fermentation (*tou*).
- For the second fermentation (*tou*), steam again and take 3 *sheng* of apricot kernels, grind to 1 *dou* and 2 *sheng* of juice, decoct to 6 *sheng*.
- For the third fermentation (*tou*), follow the same method as the second, adjusting the quantity of apricot kernel juice.

If the rice is insufficient, take an additional 2 *sheng* of apricot kernels, grind to 8 *sheng* of juice, decoct to 4 *sheng*, and ferment with steamed rice. If still insufficient, grind another 2 *sheng* of apricot kernels, extract 8 *sheng* of juice, decoct to 4 *sheng*, and ferment again until fully prepared.

For 1 *shi* of rice, use 3 *dou* of apricot kernels. The step-by-step grinding prevents souring of the juice from simultaneous decoction. In winter, decoction may proceed without restriction.

In total, 3 *dou* of apricot kernels yield 1 *shi* and 6 *dou* of juice, decocted to 8 *dou* and 4 *sheng*. Soak the yeast, divide for fermentation, and seal for twenty-eight days. Unseal, clarify, and press the dregs. Dry the dregs into powder and mix with the wine for consumption. Highly effective; a secret formula.

Divide into three doses, taken on an empty stomach. Mild sweating should occur; apply powder to the body after sweating. Severe cases resolve in no more than three or four doses; mild cases in one or two.

Reheat when cool. In winter, use the roots; in spring, the stems, steamed and slept upon—this is most effective. Other methods of warming and compressing are inferior to *Heracleum* steaming. This method is also used for wind-dampness in other regions. For postpartum abdominal pain with inability to move, lumbar and leg spasms, pain, inflexibility, or weakness, this decoction dispels wind and resolves blood stasis. *The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies* includes one large *Aconitum* but omits *Taxillus chinensis*, *Ginseng*, *Glycyrrhiza uralensis*, and *Angelica sinensis*.

**Fifth Discourse on Wind-Induced Impediment (Feng Fei) – Formulas and Moxibustion**

It is said: Wind-induced impediment manifests as sudden inability to speak, lockjaw, and stiffness with loss of control in the limbs. Treat it by grinding 5 *sheng* of *fu long gan* into powder, mixing with 8 *sheng* of cold water, stirring to extract the juice, and drinking it. Consuming the entire dose is optimal.

*The Handbook of Emergency Prescriptions* states that this formula also treats vexation, mental confusion, abdominal pain and fullness, and revival after apparent death. The following nine formulas all address this wind disorder; their sequential use should be carefully considered.

It is said: When treating this illness, one must know the proper order of administration. Do not recklessly administer decoctions and medicines, lest the opportune moment be lost. Not only may this kill the patient, but it may also lead to intractable illness. Once the condition is stabilized, first administer the **Three-Ingredient Bamboo Sap Drink**. If there is slight improvement over the usual state, proceed to the decoction.

**Bamboo Sap Drink**, for those suffering from heat-type wind, should be used first to subdue heat toxin:

Grind the thirty-two ingredients into powder, mix with white honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty pills with a decoction of fresh ginger and honey, three times daily, gradually increasing to thirty pills. Avoid oil, yeast, garlic, raw or cold foods, vinegar, slippery foods, and the meat of swine, sheep, chicken, and fish.

**Discourse**:
The ancients formulated prescriptions according to the cold or heat at the root of illness. Today, people in haste use whatever they find, which is why many remedies fail. To use a formula effectively, one must first determine whether the condition is cold or hot, then select the appropriate prescription—this ensures efficacy. This principle applies to decoctions as well as pills and powders. Wind disorders invariably arise from excessive heat, hence the use of cooling agents such as bamboo sap and *Pueraria* juice. Later scholars, failing to grasp the intent behind these formulas, necessitate this explanation.

Do not administer treatment to those without a secluded chamber. Even robust individuals in poorly sealed rooms may be afflicted by wind pathogens—how much more so for those taking medicine?

**Formula for Wind-Induced Paralysis with Inability to Speak and Loss of Limb Control**:
Measure the distance from the inner fork of the patient’s little finger to its tip, then place this length vertically from the navel toward the heart. Mark the upper end with cinnabar. Repeat this measurement twice, aligning the lower ends and fanning the upper ends to form a shape resembling an inverted triangle (△). For men, use the left hand’s measurement; for women, the right. To avoid confusion, mark the three points with cinnabar. Apply moxibustion simultaneously at all three points, one hundred cones each, to achieve a cure.

**Formulas for Treating All Wind Disorders**
*Sixth Discourse on Wind-Induced Stupor: Formulas and Acupuncture Methods*

**Du Huo Decoction**, for wind-induced stupor with inability to speak, loss of limb control, and dragging of hands and feet:
*Du huo* (4 liang), *gui xin*, *shao yao*, *gua lou gen*, *sheng ge* (2 liang each), *sheng jiang* (6 liang), *gan cao* (3 liang).
Grind the seven ingredients, then decoct in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses, to be taken thrice daily.

**Discourse**:
The spleen’s channel connects to the stomach, runs alongside the throat, links to the root of the tongue, and disperses beneath it. The heart’s collateral vessel binds to the root of the tongue. Now, when wind evil invades both the heart and spleen, the tongue stiffens and speech fails.

**Formula for Wind Stroke with Lockjaw and Inability to Speak**:
*Fang ji*, *gui xin*, *ma huang* (2 liang each), *ge gen* (3 liang), *gan cao*, *fang feng*, *shao yao* (1 liang each), *sheng jiang* (4 liang).
Grind the eight ingredients, then decoct in six *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses. Also treats aphasia and muteness.

**Shi Nan Decoction**, for sixty-four types of wind *zhu* penetrating the skin like crawling insects, stiffening the waist and spine, alternating flaccidity and spasticity, cramping of hands and feet, hidden rashes that ulcerate when scratched, wind corpse with body itching, sudden wind with facial and ocular swelling, inability to raise the hands above the head, and lockjaw with speechlessness:
*Shi nan*, *gan jiang*, *huang qin*, *xi xin*, *ren shen* (1 liang each), *gui xin*, *ma huang*, *dang gui*, *xiong qiong* (1.5 liang each), *gan cao* (2 liang), *gan di huang* (18 *zhu*), *shi zhu yu* (30 *zhu*).
Grind the twelve ingredients, then decoct in six *sheng* of water and three *sheng* of wine until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses. Profuse sweating is not to be feared.

**Formula for Wind Stroke with Lockjaw and Unconsciousness**:
*Jie zi* (1 *sheng*), *cu* (3 *sheng*).
Boil until one *sheng* remains, then apply warm to the head, wrapping it in cloth. Use once daily.

From *Zhouhou [Beiji Fang]* for treating sudden loss of speech:
Another formula:
*Chi* (fermented soybeans) five *sheng*, *wu zhu yu* (Evodia fruit) one *sheng*.
Boil the two ingredients in seven *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain, then sip gradually.

From *Zhouhou [Beiji Fang]* for treating inability to speak:
Another formula:
*Bai zhu* (white atractylodes) four *liang*, boiled in three *sheng* of wine until one *sheng* remains, then taken in one dose.

Another formula:
Take one *sheng* of *xing li* (apricot kernel juice).

Another formula:
Take one *sheng* of *dan zhu li* (bland bamboo sap).

Acupuncture and moxibustion methods:
For sudden wind stroke with lockjaw and inability to open the mouth, moxa the *jiguan* point (in *Qianjin Yifang* called *jiache*, located eight *fen* below the ear, slightly anterior). Apply five cones of moxa to restore speech. Alternatively, moxa according to the patient’s age in cones; for deviation, apply moxa to the affected side.

For wind stroke with paralysis, inability to speak, flaccidity, and lack of control:
First moxa *tianchuang* (50 cones), then pause to move the fire and moxa *baihui* (50 cones). Afterward, return to moxa *tianchuang* (50 cones). If treatment begins by moxaing *baihui* first, the wind-qi cannot disperse, attacking the five viscera internally, leading to closure and loss of voice. Thus, moxaing *tianchuang* first, then *baihui*, is optimal. Each moxa session consists of 50 cones to fully discharge the fire’s force. Repeat moxibustion according to the severity of the illness; in severe cases, apply 300 cones to one site for great efficacy.

For all wind stroke cases where medicinal treatment exacerbates symptoms, moxa all wind-related points with three cones each—there is no case that will not be cured. This method is divinely effective. Decide resolutely without doubt. However, do not apply moxa recklessly without sincerity.

Discourse:
When wind-cold qi lodges within, stagnating and failing to disperse, it causes aphonia and inability to speak, as well as throat impediment with loss of voice—all due to wind evil. If it enters the viscera, it can kill. Thus, these treatments are appended to the end of wind formulas.

For corpse-like syncope with apparent death but persistent pulse: this occurs when yang qi descends and yin qi contends upward, causing qi closure. Needle *baihui* to a depth of three *fen* and reinforce. Then iron the flanks with a heated iron. Alternatively, take a pellet of soot from a stove chimney the size of a bullet, mixed with fermented water. Also, needle the tip of the middle toe, removing a section of nail the width of a leek leaf, and pierce the inner side of the big toe’s nail, three *fen* from the edge.

Cinnamon decoction for sudden loss of voice:
Boil cinnamon thickly and take one *sheng*, then cover to induce sweating. Alternatively, grind cinnamon into powder and place it under the tongue, gradually swallowing the juice.

Another formula:
Boil thick soybean juice and hold it in the mouth—also effective. If soybeans are unavailable, use *chi* (fermented soybeans).

Formula for sudden loss of speech:
Mix five *ge* of wine with half a portion of human breast milk, then divide into two doses for two days.

Discourse:
For twitching eyelids, deviated mouth and lips—all signs of wind entering the channels—urgently administer *Renxu Ming Tang* (Life-Continuing Decoction), *Fuzi San* (Aconite Powder), apply *Shenming Gao* (Divine Clarity Ointment) and *Danshen Gao* (Salvia Ointment), and moxa according to the appropriate points. Throat impediment and flaccid tongue are treated similarly.

When wind enters the viscera, causing sudden aphonia, death-like collapse, drawn mouth and eyes, clenched jaw, stiff tongue, and facial deviation: administer *Fulonggan San* (Oven Earth Powder) mixed with rooster comb blood and turtle blood, applying it to the affected area. When dry, reapply. Also moxa the transverse creases at the corners of the mouth, at the red-white junction, following the left or right deviation. Apply moxa according to the patient’s age in cones, repeating up to three times. If no improvement occurs after three days, repeat the treatment.

*Aconite Powder* for wind stroke with numbness in the hands and arms, and facial deviation:
*Fuzi* (aconite), *gui xin* (cinnamon bark) (five *liang* each), *xi xin* (asarum), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *ren shen* (ginseng), *gan jiang* (dried ginger) (six *liang* each).
Grind the six ingredients into powder. Take one *fangcunbi* with wine, three times daily, gradually increasing the dose.

*Gancao Tang* (Licorice Decoction) for long-standing hemiplegia with emaciated limbs, facial deviation, mental instability, and slurred speech:
*Gancao* (licorice), *gui xin* (cinnamon bark), *xiong qiong* (chuanxiong), *ma huang* (ephedra), *dang gui* (Chinese angelica), *shao yao* (peony), *ren shen* (ginseng) (two *liang* each), *fuzi* (aconite), *cezi* (lateral aconite) (two pieces each), *du huo* (angelica pubescens), *fang ji* (stephania) (three *liang* each), *sheng jiang* (fresh ginger), *shi gao* (gypsum), *fu shen* (poria with hostwood) (four *liang* each), *bai zhu* (white atractylodes), *huang qin* (scutellaria), *xi xin* (asarum) (one *liang* each), *qin jiao* (gentiana), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia) (one and a half *liang* each), *ju hua* (chrysanthemum) (one *sheng*), *dan zhu li* (bland bamboo sap) (four *sheng*).
Crush the twenty-one ingredients, then boil *ma huang* first in one *dou* of water, skimming off the foam, until seven *sheng* remain. Add the bamboo sap and remaining ingredients, boiling until three *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses. After three doses, take a cup of porridge, then administer the final dose, allowing the medicine’s effect to induce sweating naturally. Avoid raw, cold, vinegar, garlic, wheat noodles, dairy, fish, and similar foods.

Formula for wind stroke with facial distortion, mouth drawn to the ear, clenched jaw, and stiff tongue:
*Du huo* (angelica pubescens) (three *liang*), *sheng dihuang zhi* (fresh rehmannia juice), *zhu li* (bamboo sap) (one *sheng* each).
Combine and decoct until one *sheng* remains, then take in one dose for immediate recovery.

Another formula:
*Mu li* (oyster shell), *fan shi* (alum), *fuzi* (aconite), *zao xia huang tu* (yellow earth from under a stove) (equal parts).
Grind into powder, then mix with the blood from a three-year-old rooster’s comb and apply to the affected area. Hold a mirror to monitor progress; as soon as the face begins to return to normal, immediately wash off the medicine. If not removed promptly, the effect will pass and the face will not recover. *Qianjin Yifang* states: for right deviation, apply to the left; for left deviation, apply to the right.

Another formula:
*Zhu li* (bamboo sap) (three *sheng*), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *fang ji* (stephania), *sheng ma* (cimicifuga), *gui xin* (cinnamon bark), *xiong qiong* (chuanxiong) (two *liang* each), *ma huang* (ephedra) (four *liang*), *ling yang jiao* (antelope horn) (three *liang*).
Crush the eight ingredients, then combine with the bamboo sap and four *sheng* of water, boiling until one and a half *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses, taking one dose daily. This formula is consistently effective.

Another formula:
Pound one *jin* of green pine needles to extract the juice, then steep in one *dou* of clear wine for two nights, warming by the fire for one night. Begin with half a *sheng*, gradually increasing to one *sheng*, until sweat appears on the head and face, then stop.

Another formula:
Boil cinnamon in wine to extract the juice, then use an old cloth to apply it to the affected area until the face returns to normal. For left deviation, apply to the right; for right deviation, apply to the left.

These secret formulas are not transmitted lightly; I have frequently used them with great efficacy.

**Formula for Treating Facial Deviation (Mouth and Ear Distortion):**
*Fangfeng* (Saposhnikovia root), *fuzi* (processed aconite), and *gegen* (kudzu root) (each two *liang*); *baishi* (cypress seed) and *mahuang* (ephedra) (each three *liang*); *duhuo* (pubescent angelica root) and fresh ginger (each four *liang*); thirty *xingren* (apricot kernels).

**Another Formula:**
Stir-fry three *sheng* of soybeans until charred, then steep in three *sheng* of wine and strain to obtain the juice. Consume in one dose. The *Zhouhou* [Handbook of Emergency Remedies] uses this to treat lockjaw.

**Another Formula:**
Take one *liang* of *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust), remove the skin and seeds, sift, and mix with three-year-old vinegar. For left deviation, apply to the right; for right deviation, apply to the left. Reapply as it dries.

**Wen’s Formula:**
Take a five-*cun* reed tube, insert one end into the ear, and seal the surrounding area tightly with dough to prevent qi leakage. Place one soybean and *ai* (mugwort) at the other end, ignite, and moxa seven cones. For right-side affliction, moxa the left; for left-side affliction, moxa the right. This is a priceless, untransmitted method. It also treats ear disorders.

**Another Formula:**
Moxa the *jiaomai* (intersecting vessels) on the hand with three cones. For left affliction, moxa the right; for right affliction, moxa the left. Shape the moxa cones like rat droppings, placing them horizontally and igniting both ends.

**Zhiru Wine, for Cases Where Other Medicines Fail to Alleviate:**
Scrape the green outer layer of *zhishi* (immature bitter orange) to obtain the powder, stopping just before the core. Collect five *sheng* of the scrapings, stir-fry over low heat to remove moisture, then steep in one *dou* of wine. Warm gently to infuse the wine with the medicine’s properties. Drink according to tolerance. Highly effective for facial deviation and spasms, treating both slow and acute wind disorders. The *Zhouhou* uses this for rigidity where the body cannot bend, extend, or turn. *Zhishu* (trifoliate orange) bark may also be used.

**Treatises on Cold Damage Disorders**
**First Treatise: General Principles of Cold Damage**

It is said in the *Book of Changes*: "Heaven and Earth undergo transformations, each fulfilling its proper nature and destiny." Yet the traces of these transformations are boundless, and the workings of nature and destiny are unfathomable. Thus, there arise scorching heat and bitter cold, wind and rain, darkness and gloom, floods and droughts, calamitous omens, and strange infestations of insects. The four seasons and eight solar terms each manifest their transformations differently; the seventy-two pentads, governed by the movements of the sun and moon, follow their own distinct courses. Only when the full measure of the solar cycle is complete does the year reach its fulfillment—this is called the completion of the annual workings of Heaven and Earth.

If even Heaven and Earth are thus, how can man remain untouched by such affairs? Therefore, man, born between Heaven and Earth, is subject to the vicissitudes of fate and the alternations of fortune and misfortune. Joy and sorrow, safety and peril, love and hatred, life and death, anxiety and fear—these concerns weigh upon the heart daily in a thousand ways, while the strategies for preserving oneself arise in ten thousand forms with each passing day. Thus, Heaven is never without the alternation of cold and heat, just as man is never without a single day of worry or joy. When epidemic diseases caused by the movements of Heaven arise, they are but one manifestation of the transformations of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*. This is an inevitable principle of creation, one that cannot be avoided.

Though the sage possesses the virtue to mend Heaven and establish the ultimate Dao, he cannot abolish such phenomena; yet he can govern them through the Dao. The worthy, skilled in nurturing life, understand moderation and adapt to the times, thereby preserving their well-being. Heaven and Earth give rise to these pestilential *qi*, but they also provide the means to guard against them—what is called "knowing the method." With this knowledge, illness has no means to invade.

Yet the common people call this affliction a "sudden illness," often failing to understand its treatment. They say, "Wait until the appointed time, and it will resolve on its own." By this neglect, more than half of those afflicted perish unjustly. At the first sign of discomfort, one must seek remedy until recovery is complete. Then, with decoctions and food administered in full, the virulence of the toxin is broken, and healing comes naturally. One must never allow the pathogenic *qi* to act freely, wantonly attacking the body, nor should one fold their hands and await death—this is the height of error.

Here, I have broadly gathered the classics to compile two scrolls, upper and lower, offering extensive preparations. Those who cherish life may study them in detail.

The *Minor Treatise* states: From ancient times to the present, Cold Damage has been regarded as a difficult-to-treat disorder, while seasonal epidemics are deemed toxic *qi*. Yet those who discuss treatment do not distinguish between Cold Damage and seasonal epidemics as distinct *qi*. They say Cold Damage is the refined term, while "seasonal epidemic" is the rustic expression, without explaining the differences in the illnesses themselves. Examining the various classics, however, reveals that they are indeed distinct. Their appropriate treatments differ, and their principles must be carefully distinguished. Thus, I have briefly outlined their essentials.

The classics state: The *qi* of spring is warm and mild, that of summer is hot and scorching, autumn’s *qi* is clear and cool, and winter’s *qi* is biting and severe—this is the proper sequence of the four seasons’ *qi*. In the depths of winter, when severe cold prevails, all things retreat into deep concealment. The noble person secures himself tightly, thus remaining unharmed by the cold. Those who recklessly expose themselves to it, however, contract Cold Damage.

Though exposure to the *qi* of any season may cause illness, Cold Damage is deemed toxic because it is the most virulent and deadly of all *qi*. When struck and falling ill immediately, it is called Cold Damage. If one does not fall ill at once, the cold toxin lurks within the muscles and bones, transforming into Warm Disease by spring and into Summerheat Disease by summer. Summerheat Disease, being extreme heat, is more severe than Warm Disease. Thus, those who toil and suffer—falling ill with Warm Disease or Heat Disease in spring and summer—do so because they were exposed to cold in winter. This is not due to seasonal epidemic *qi*.

Seasonal epidemics occur when spring, which should be warm, turns bitterly cold; when summer, which should be hot, turns bitterly chilly; when autumn, which should be cool, turns scorching; or when winter, which should be cold, turns unseasonably warm. These are instances of *qi* appearing out of its proper time. Thus, in a single year, the sick—regardless of age—often present with similar symptoms. This is the nature of seasonal epidemic *qi*.

Cold Damage progresses day by day in severity, and treatment must be applied accordingly. Yet in modern times, when people contract Cold Damage, some fail to seek early treatment, others receive treatment that does not cure them, and still others delay for days until they are gravely ill before consulting a physician. If the physician rigidly follows the prescribed sequence of formulas, the treatment will not match the disease. Only by adjusting the formula in response to the patient’s condition can efficacy be achieved.

Hua Tuo said: When Cold Damage first strikes, on the first day it lodges in the skin. Rubbing with medicinal ointment and applying fire moxibustion will cure it. If unresolved, by the second day it reaches the flesh. One may then follow the method of acupuncture and administer a *jieji* powder to induce sweating; once sweat appears, the illness resolves. If still unresolved, by the third day it penetrates the muscles. Another round of sweating will cure it. If unresolved, cease further sweating.

By the fourth day, the illness settles in the chest. One should take *Lilu* pills to induce mild vomiting, which will bring recovery. If the illness is severe and *Lilu* pills fail to induce vomiting, administer *Xiaodou Guadi* powder to provoke vomiting and effect a cure. If the patient remains unconscious, apply acupuncture once more upon awakening.

By the fifth day, the illness reaches the abdomen; by the sixth day, it enters the stomach. Only then may purgation be applied. If the heat toxin remains external, not yet having entered the stomach, and one prematurely purges, the heat will exploit the resulting vacuity to invade the stomach, causing it to ulcerate. Once heat enters the stomach, it must be purged without delay; it cannot be allowed to linger.

If the stomach is replete with heat, the condition is critical: three deaths for every one survival. If the stomach is vacuous when heat enters, it ulcerates. In mild cases, red macules appear—this portends five deaths for every one survival. In severe cases, black macules appear—this portends ten deaths for every one survival. Outcomes vary according to the patient’s strength and the difficulty of the illness.

If the patient exhibits no fever but raves, is restless and agitated, and speaks incoherently without awareness, do not force fire treatment. Instead, administer one *fangcunbi* of *Zhuling* powder with one *sheng* of freshly drawn water—or two *sheng* for those who can tolerate it—then insert a finger into the throat to induce vomiting. The illness will resolve immediately. If vomiting cannot be induced, do not force water, lest it stagnate and bind beneath the heart. Instead, use other emetics to provoke vomiting, ensuring the patient remains conscious. Failure to do so risks further danger.

For such cases, if *Zhuling* powder is not used promptly to induce vomiting and resolve the illness, death will come swiftly. Alternatively, one may first administer toxin-removing substances or apply acupuncture—this is even better. If the diaphragm is replete with stagnant fluids, the condition is difficult to treat, with three deaths for every one survival.

If the illness persists beyond the proper time for purgation, the heat cannot be vented, and the stomach will ulcerate, producing macules. In spring and summer, avoid strong emetics and purgatives; in autumn and winter, avoid strong sweating.

For inducing sweating: In deep winter and early spring, when severe cold prevails, one may take *Shendan* pills or apply medicinal ointment with fire moxibustion. In late spring, summer, and early autumn—when the weather is hot—avoid fire moxibustion and heavy covering. Instead, administer *Liuwu Qing* powder, *Cui Wenxing’s Duzhang* powder, *Chi* powder, or *Xue* decoction. If no pills, powders, or decoctions are available, simply boil several *liang* of *chaihu*. For Cold Damage and seasonal epidemics, these may also be used to induce sweating.

If sweating two or three times fails to resolve the illness, administer decoctions. If repletion is present, proceed to purgation. When the pulse is replete in the morning and vacuous at dusk, this indicates internal repletion. If the pulse is even in the morning and vacuous at dusk, this does not indicate repletion. Purgative decoctions may be administered early, but only in small doses to avoid excessive purgation. Small doses should be given frequently.

For conditions of vacuity taxation with heat, the symptoms resemble Cold Damage, yet there is no aversion to cold or generalized pain. Thus, one knows it is not Cold Damage and must not induce sweating. There is no headache, and the pulse is not tight or rapid, so one knows it is not internal repletion and must not purge. If one forcibly attacks such conditions—whether internally or externally—the patient will become depleted and exhausted, leading to many deaths and few recoveries.

For vacuity taxation with heat, administer *Zhuye* decoction. If there is vomiting, give *Jupi* decoction once. If unresolved, it may be administered again. This method has proven highly effective in numerous cases. It is also suitable for vacuity taxation with heat following Cold Damage.

Wang Shuhe said: When yang is exuberant and yin is vacuous (*Waatai* reads: "the exterior harmonious, the interior diseased"), sweating will cause death, while purgation will bring recovery. When yang is vacuous and yin is exuberant (*Waatai* reads: "the interior harmonious, the exterior diseased"), purgation will cause death, while sweating will bring recovery. In such cases, how can *Shendan* be misapplied to induce sweating, or *Gansui* be recklessly used to attack? The treatment of vacuity and exuberance (*Waatai* reads: "the treatment of exterior and interior") diverges by a thousand *li*, and the mechanism of fortune and misfortune responds as swiftly as an echo.

Thus, when *Guizhi* decoction enters the throat, if yang is exuberant, death ensues (*Waatai* reads: "if the exterior is harmonious, death ensues"); when *Chengqi* enters the stomach, if yin is exuberant, destruction follows (*Waatai* reads: "if the interior is harmonious, destruction follows"). In such intricate interplay of yin-yang vacuity and repletion, the signs are exceedingly subtle; the contradictions among sweating, emesis, and purgation bring calamity with swift inevitability. Yet shallow and narrow in their craft, physicians fail to recognize or comprehend—patients perish, and they claim it was fated, leaving grieving spirits to choke the paths of the netherworld and untimely deaths to fill the open fields. Who with compassion could witness this and not ache with sorrow?

Now, *Cold Damage* illness arises when wind and cold penetrate the interstices, contending with the essence-qi, obstructing the constructive and defensive, and blocking their circulation. On the first or second day, the qi lingers in the pores and skin, so the patient suffers headache and aversion to cold, with stiffness and heaviness in the waist and back—this is when the evil qi is at the exterior, and sweating brings recovery. After three days, the qi floats upward, congesting the chest and heart, causing headache and fullness in the chest; here, emesis brings recovery. After five days, the qi sinks and binds in the viscera, producing abdominal distension, bodily heaviness, and vexing pain in the bones and joints; here, purgation brings recovery. One must carefully observe the signs of the illness and not recklessly administer decoctions, lest the stomach qi be depleted. The *Canon* states: with a faint pulse, emesis is forbidden; with a vacuous and fine pulse, purgation is forbidden; moreover, in summer, purgation is also forbidden—these are the great prohibitions of medicine.

Pulses may be deep or floating, ever-changing in their transformations. Sometimes a patient falls ill for several days before informing the physician; though they claim it began recently, the disease has already accumulated in the body, its knots formed, no longer removable by sweating or resolving the flesh. One must examine the pulse thoroughly, adapt to the circumstances, and seek relief to avoid disaster. One cannot rigidly adhere to the sequence, missing the critical moment and thus inviting calamity.

This sequence of *Cold Damage*—sweating within three days—applies when one is exposed to wind while undressing, sleeps uncovered at night, or is struck by cold or warmth, as well as when epidemic qi or evil winds spread contagion, or when one is afflicted by malign influences. However, if one has simply consumed excessive cold food and drink, causing indigestion in the abdomen and viscera, with difficulty in movement, headache, and fever, and the pulse is replete and large, then emesis or purgation is appropriate—sweating must not be induced.

Chen Linqiu said: Someone asked, "If a patient takes decoctions repeatedly to induce sweating but no sweat emerges, what should be done?" I replied: The medical classics state that when repeated sweating fails to produce sweat, it is a fatal illness. I considered this and thought one could steam the patient as in the method for *zhongfeng*. By applying hot, warm qi externally, sweat cannot but emerge. Later, I asked Zhang Miao, who said: There was once a man who, exhausted from labor, sweated profusely, then lay down on a single mat and fell ill from cold. He suffered only from cold and fatigue. Various physicians gave him pills, powders, and decoctions, and within four days, they attempted sweating eight times, yet no sweat emerged. I ordered the ground to be heated and peach leaves spread over it to steam him, whereupon he broke into a great sweat. While still in the bedding, he was dusted with powder to dry his body thoroughly before rising, and he recovered. Thereafter, I used this method to induce sweating many times, and sweat always emerged. Some people naturally have difficulty sweating, not merely due to illness—steaming ensures sweat will emerge without fail.

For all illnesses with fever, aversion to cold, and a floating, surging pulse, sweating is immediately appropriate. Dust the body with warm powder and avoid exposure to wind. When sweating is indicated but the patient has recently suffered blood loss or severe diarrhea, great sweating must not be induced. Instead, administer small, frequent doses of *Guizhi* decoction to moisten the body until slight sweating occurs over several days, and the illness will resolve spontaneously.

It is said: Whenever one feels even slightly unwell, unlike their usual state, they must seek treatment early. If they endure and delay, hoping for spontaneous recovery, in a short while the illness may become severe. This is especially true for children and women. When the seasonal qi is disharmonious, one should be cautious. If there is even slight disharmony, treatment must begin promptly, tracing the evil’s origin and addressing it while still in the interstices—few will not recover. Yet patients often endure for days before speaking up; by the time the evil qi enters the viscera, it becomes difficult to control, and even the most skilled physicians can do nothing.

Abscesses, deep-rooted boils, clove sores, throat impediment, and guest-natured illnesses are particularly urgent—this is the essence of nurturing life. When preparing decoctions, one must not avoid mornings, nights, or inauspicious days. At the first sign of pain, treatment should begin immediately, without waiting for morning or evening, for recovery will then be easier. When taking medicine, one must follow the method precisely. If one acts willfully against the physician’s instructions, treatment is unnecessary.

Generally, *Cold Damage* arises from wind and cold. Initially, wind and cold strike the exterior, and once they enter the interior, they are not dispelled—there has never been a case where proper warming and covering failed to resolve them. When afflicted by seasonal qi illness, if after five or six days one becomes thirsty and desires water but cannot drink much, it should not be given. The reason is that the heat in the abdomen is still slight and cannot disperse it, and giving water would only create further illness. If by seven or eight days one is extremely thirsty and desires water, it may still be given according to the signs, but not to excess. If one could drink a *dou*, give half that amount. If drinking causes abdominal fullness, rough urination, panting, or hiccups, water must not be given. If suddenly a great sweat breaks out, recovery is imminent. When a patient can drink water, recovery is near.

For all warm illnesses, the fifty-nine acupuncture points may be needled. Moreover, the body has six hundred and fifty-five points; moxibustion on thirty-six of them is harmful, and needling seventy-nine of them invites disaster.

It is said: In studying and seeking remedies, speed in saving lives is paramount. Thus, those who nurture life must prepare medicines in advance to meet urgent needs. Here, they are recorded below.

**Second Remedy for Warding Off Warm Illnesses: Symptoms of Dampness and Firmness**

On cloudy or heavily foggy days, burn one pill before the door or window; this is excellent.

**Realgar Pill**: In the second year of the *Jianning* reign (169 CE), when the Year Star was in *You* and epidemic *qi* spread widely, causing countless deaths, a scholar named Ding Jihui arrived from Mount Qingcheng in Shu, passing through Nanyang. Entering through the western market gate, he saw many afflicted with epidemic pestilence. He took medicine from his bag and gave one pill to each person. As soon as the divine remedy touched their lips, none failed to recover. Hundreds of epidemic ghosts in the market, seeing the scholar administer the medicine, fled in terror.

Then a ghost king appeared before the scholar, declaring him possessed of Daoist arts and moved by his distribution of medicine, which had caused the multitude of ghosts to flee in such terror. The ghost king approached the scholar, seeking to learn his Daoist arts. The scholar replied, "I have no Daoist arts—only the medicine in my bag." He presented it to the ghost king, who, upon seeing the remedy, prostrated himself in alarm, begging for mercy before fleeing.

This formula, when carried into the mountains, repels tigers, wolves, snakes, and insects; when entering water, it dispels water spirits, dragons, and river monsters.

**Fifth Example of Sweating Decoctions: Cinnamon Twig Patterns**

General principles state: In spring and summer, sweating is generally appropriate. When inducing sweating, ensure it spreads evenly to the hands and feet, reaching a gentle, continuous state within about an hour—this is ideal. However, avoid excessive sweating like flowing water.
If the illness persists, induce sweating again.
Excessive sweating depletes yang; with yang deficiency, do not induce sweating repeatedly.
When taking decoctions to induce sweating, discontinue once the illness subsides; the full dose is unnecessary.
If sweating is recommended but no decoction is specified, pills or powders may also be used, as long as sweating occurs for resolution. However, decoctions tailored to the pattern are more effective.
If a patient sweats spontaneously without cause, inducing sweating again will lead to recovery, as it restores harmony to the defensive *qi*.
A floating pulse indicates an external illness; sweating is appropriate, and *Guizhi Tang* (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) is suitable.
A floating, large, and rapid pulse also indicates suitability for sweating, and *Guizhi Tang* is appropriate.
If a patient constantly sweats spontaneously, this indicates harmony of the nutritive *qi*. If the exterior remains unresolved despite harmonious nutritive *qi*, the defensive *qi* is disharmonious. The nutritive *qi* flows within the vessels, while the defensive *qi* flows outside them. Inducing sweating again will harmonize the defensive *qi* and lead to recovery; *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
If a patient has no internal illness but frequently experiences fever and spontaneous sweating without recovery, this is due to disharmony of the defensive *qi*. Inducing sweating before the onset of symptoms will lead to recovery; *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease with fever and sweating, the nutritive *qi* is weak and the defensive *qi* is strong, causing sweating. To expel pathogenic wind, *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease with headache, fever, sweating, and aversion to wind and cold, *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease with mild panting after purging, the exterior remains unresolved; *Guizhi Jia Houpo Xingren Tang* (Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Magnolia and Apricot Kernel) is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease with unresolved exterior symptoms, purging is inappropriate; *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease, if sweating is induced first but the illness persists and purging is then applied, a floating pulse indicates non-recovery. A floating pulse signifies an external illness, yet purging was applied—hence the lack of recovery. Since the pulse remains floating, the illness is still external, and resolving the exterior will lead to recovery; *Guizhi Tang* is suitable.
In *Taiyang* disease, if qi surges upward after purging, *Guizhi Tang* may be administered. If no upward surge occurs, it should not be given.
*Guizhi Tang* is fundamentally for resolving the muscles. If the pulse is floating and tight, with fever and no sweating, do not administer it. Remember this to avoid error.
For habitual drinkers, do not administer *Guizhi Tang*, as it will induce vomiting.
If vomiting occurs after taking *Guizhi Tang*, the patient will later vomit pus and blood.

**Cinnamon Twig Decoction** – Treats wind strike with a pulse that is floating in the yang and weak in the yin. A floating yang pulse indicates spontaneous heat, while a weak yin pulse indicates spontaneous sweating. There is aversion to wind with a rough sensation, aversion to cold with a chilly sensation, intermittent fever, nasal congestion, and dry heaves. The formula consists of:

**Cinnamon Twig (Guizhi), Peony (Shaoyao), and Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang)** – each three *liang*; **Licorice (Gancao)** – two *liang*; **Jujubes (Dazao)** – twelve pieces. Of these five ingredients, [missing character] chop the first three, slice the ginger, and split the jujubes. Boil the jujubes in seven *sheng* of water until soft, strain, then add the remaining ingredients. If the water is insufficient, add more, and simmer until gently boiling. Reduce to three *sheng*, then strain. Take one *sheng* three times daily; for children, adjust the dose as appropriate.

If slight sweating occurs soon after the first dose, slightly lengthen the interval between doses. If no sweating occurs, slightly shorten the interval to ensure the medicinal effect is continuous. Once sweating begins, protect the patient carefully as prescribed, taking special care to avoid wind. If the illness is severe, administer a dose at night. If one dose does not resolve the condition and the symptoms remain unchanged, repeat the dose as needed. Some patients may require two or three doses before sweating occurs and recovery follows. After taking the decoction, consume hot congee shortly thereafter to assist the medicinal effect.

**Ephedra Decoction (Mahuang Tang)** – Treats cold damage with headache, lumbar pain, generalized joint pain, fever, aversion to cold, absence of sweating, and panting. The formula consists of:
**Ephedra (Mahuang)** – three *liang*; **Cinnamon Heart (Guixin)** – two *liang*; **Licorice (Gancao)** – two *liang**; **Apricot Kernels (Xingren)** – seventy pieces (if panting is mild, use fifty). Of these four ingredients, [missing character] chop, then boil the ephedra in nine *sheng* of water, reducing by two *sheng*. Skim off the foam, add the remaining ingredients, and boil until two and a half *sheng* remain. Strain and take eight *ge*. Cover the patient to induce sweating.

**Major Blue Dragon Decoction (Da Qinglong Tang)** – Treats wind strike and cold damage with a floating, tight pulse, fever, aversion to cold, generalized pain, absence of sweating, and vexation. The formula consists of:
**Ephedra (Mahuang)** – six *liang*; **Cinnamon Heart (Guixin)** – two *liang*; **Licorice (Gancao)** – two *liang*; **Gypsum (Shigao)** – one piece the size of a chicken egg, crushed; **Fresh Ginger (Shengjiang)** – three *liang*; **Apricot Kernels (Xingren)** – forty pieces; **Jujubes (Dazao)** – twelve pieces. Of these seven ingredients, [missing character] chop, then boil the ephedra in nine *sheng* of water, skimming off the foam before adding the remaining ingredients. Boil until three *sheng* remain. Divide and take one *sheng* per dose, covering the patient thickly to induce profuse sweating. Apply warm powder to stop sweating; do not administer a second dose. If taken improperly, it may cause muscle twitching and jerking—this is a sign of reversal. If no sweating occurs, a second dose may be given.

**Yang Toxin Cimicifuga Decoction (Yangdu Shengma Tang)** – Treats cold damage that transforms into yang toxin within one or two days, or yang toxin arising after vomiting or purging from improper medication. Symptoms include heaviness of the body, lumbar and back pain, vexation and restlessness, delirious speech, or running about, seeing ghosts, vomiting blood, or diarrhea. The pulse is floating, large, and rapid; the face is red with a brocade-like rash; the throat is painful with expectoration of pus and blood. The condition is treatable within five days but becomes incurable by seven. The formula consists of:
**Cimicifuga (Shengma)** – half a *liang*; **Licorice (Gancao)** – half a *liang*; **Chinese Angelica (Danggui)** – six *zhu*; **Sichuan Pepper (Shujiao)** – six *zhu*; **Realgar (Xionghuang)** – six *zhu*; **Cinnamon Heart (Guixin)** – six *zhu*. Of these six ingredients, [missing character] chop, then boil in five *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses, taking one dose every time a person walks five *li*. Cover the hands and feet warmly; when the toxin is expelled, sweating will occur, and the condition will resolve. If unresolved, prepare and administer another dose; vomiting is also beneficial.

*Master Zhongjing’s* version omits **Cinnamon Heart** and includes **Turtle Shell (Biejia)** the size of a hand. The *Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies* and the *Thousand Golden Remedies* follow this version. The *Collection of Verified Remedies Ancient and Modern* includes **Gardenia (Zhizi)** – six *zhu* and **Turtle Shell (Biejia)** the size of a hand.

**Licorice Decoction for Yin Toxin** – treats cold damage that has just begun for one or two days and promptly congeals into yin toxin, or after taking medicine for six or seven days up to ten days, transforms into yin toxin. Symptoms include heaviness of the body, stiffness of the back, twisting pain in the abdomen, obstruction of the throat, toxin attacking the heart, hardness and tension below the heart, shortness of breath, counterflow retching, bluish lips and blackened face, reversal cold of the four limbs, and a pulse that is deep, fine, tight, and rapid. *Master Zhongjing* states this is the sign of yin toxin: the body feels as if beaten. It may be treated within five or six days, but by the seventh day, it cannot be cured.

**Ingredients:**
Licorice – half a *liang*
*Cimicifuga (Shengma)* – half a *liang*

*Large gentian*
*Solomon’s seal*
*Licorice* – each two *liang*
*Swallowwort*
*Immature bitter orange* – each two *liang*

Chop the thirteen ingredients, then boil in nine *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses; after covering to induce sweating, apply *Stephania* ointment externally.

For cold damage persisting beyond three days, where previous formulas fail to resolve the condition and the pulse remains rapid, indicating that *yang qi* still lingers in the channels and network vessels without entering the viscera:

**Ingredients:**
*Cinnamon twig*
*Scutellaria*
*Licorice* – each two *liang*
*Cimicifuga*
*Kudzu*
*Fresh ginger* – each three *liang*
*Peony* – six *liang*
*Gypsum* – eight *liang*
*Gardenia* – fourteen pieces

Chop the nine ingredients, then boil in nine *sheng* of water until two *sheng* and seven *ge* remain. Divide into three doses, spaced at intervals of ten *li*. If sweating occurs after the first two doses, discontinue the third; if no sweat appears, take an additional dose, stopping once sweating begins. If still no sweat, the next day omit *gardenia*, add two *liang* of *ephedra*, increase water by two *sheng*, and proceed as before.

**Snow Decoction** – a formula for cold damage:

**Ingredients:**
*Ephedra* – ten *jin*
*Rhubarb* – one *jin* and twelve *liang* (golden-colored)
*Apricot kernel* – three *dou* and four *sheng*

Chop the three ingredients, then soak the *ephedra* in five *hu* and four *dou* of snow water in an east-facing cauldron for three nights. Add *rhubarb*, stir to blend, and boil with mulberry firewood until two *hu* of liquid remain. Strain, return the liquid to the cauldron, pound the *apricot kernels*, add to the liquid, and boil again until six or seven *dou* remain. Strain, place in a copper vessel, combine with three *dou* of snow water, and simmer while stirring until two *dou* and four *sheng* remain. When the decoction reaches a consistency suitable for forming pills, allow it to cool and congeal into pills the size of a bullet. For those afflicted, boil five *ge* of water until it bubbles three times, grind one pill into the water, and administer at an appropriate temperature to induce immediate sweating. If the condition persists, take another pill. Store the medicine tightly sealed to prevent leakage of *qi*.

**Cold Damage Remedies**

**Sixth Formula: Diaphoretic Pills**

**Divine Elixir Pill** – Treats cold damage with red, rough eyes, aversion to cold, fever, and body pain. Formula:
- *Aconite* (附子) 4 liang
- *Crow’s Head* (乌头) 4 liang
- *Ginseng* (人参) 5 liang
- *Poria* (茯苓) 5 liang
- *Pinellia* (半夏) 5 liang
- *Cinnabar* (朱砂) 1 liang

Grind the six ingredients into powder, form into honey pills, and color with true elixir. Take two pills the size of a soybean before meals, followed by fresh ginger decoction, three times daily. Shortly after, consume two *sheng* of hot congee, cover heavily, and cease when sweating occurs. If sweating does not occur or is insufficient to resolve the condition, repeat the dose as before. If sweating is adequate yet the condition persists, administer *Cassia Twig Decoction*. This medicine is highly toxic—those with heat should drink water, while those with cold should take warm fluids to counteract it.

For malaria, take two pills before the onset.

*The Essentials* uses *Asarum* (细辛) instead of *Ginseng* and includes one *Belamcanda* (射干) pill the size of a jujube, calling it *Red Pill*, which governs cold *qi* and counterflow reversal.

**Wheat Slave Pill** – Treats unresolved cold damage after five or six days, with heat in the chest, lockjaw, inability to speak, and desire for water, indicating deteriorated cold damage beyond medical aid, approaching death. If the patient’s heart remains slightly warm, use a stick to open the mouth and administer the medicine; recovery follows if the medicine is swallowed. Also called *Black Slave Pill* or *Water-Resolving Pill*. Formula:
- *Pot Soot* (釜底墨) 1 liang
- *Chimney Soot* (灶突墨) 1 liang
- *Beam Dust* (梁上墨) 1 liang
- *Wheat Slave* (麦奴) 1 liang
- *Scorch* (黄令) 1 liang
- *Rhubarb* (大黄) 1 liang
- *Mirabilite* (芒硝) 1 liang
- *Ephedra* (麻黄) 2 liang

Grind the eight ingredients into powder, form into honey pills the size of a bullet. Grind one pill in five *ge* of freshly drawn water, soak until dissolved, and administer. If the patient is thirsty, allow unrestricted water intake; if unwilling, compel them to drink. Shortly after taking the medicine, the patient will feel cold, followed by sweating and resolution. If no sweating occurs after the shadow moves five *chi*, repeat the dose as before, with no more than two or three administrations being optimal.

*Wheat Slave* refers to the black mold on wheat.

**Seventh Principle: Emetic Remedies**

**Guidelines** – The general rule states that in spring, emetics should be used sparingly; cease once the condition improves, without completing the full dose.

For conditions resembling *Cassia Twig Syndrome* but without headache or stiff neck, with a floating pulse at the inch position, fullness in the chest, and *qi* surging upward to the throat causing breathlessness—this indicates long-standing phlegm, suitable for emesis.

For various cold conditions in the chest, with oppression and pain, inability to eat, desire for pressure (which instead produces drool), and over ten bouts of diarrhea daily, if the patient’s pulse is slow and the inch pulse slightly slippery, emesis is appropriate; diarrhea will cease afterward.

For *Lesser Yin* disease where food is immediately vomited, with internal discomfort and inability to vomit despite the urge, emesis is suitable—undigested food in the upper passage should be expelled.

For cold counterflow in the hands and feet with intermittent pulse, guest *qi* in the chest causing fullness, vexation, and inability to eat due to chest congestion, emesis is appropriate.

**Melon Stalk Powder** – For conditions resembling *Cassia Twig Syndrome* but without headache or stiff neck, with a slightly floating inch pulse, chest fullness and hardness, and *qi* rushing upward to the throat causing breathlessness—this indicates cold in the chest, suitable for emesis. Formula:
- *Melon Stalk* (瓜蒂) 1 liang
- *Red Small Beans* (赤小豆) 1 liang

Grind the two ingredients and sift. Take one *qianbi* with one *ge* of fermented soybean, boil in seven *ge* of water to make a thin gruel, strain, and administer the liquid warm in one dose. If vomiting does not occur, gradually increase the dose until vomiting is induced.

*Zhang Wenzhong* administers it with three *ge* of plain hot water.

**Water-Inducing Powder** – Treats seasonal epidemic disease with burning heat, delirious speech, and erratic behavior. Formula:
- *Kansui* (甘遂) 0.5 liang
- *Angelica* (白芷) 2 liang

Grind the two ingredients and sift. Take one *fangcunbi* with water, then have the patient drink cold water until the abdomen is full, inducing vomiting; urine should turn red. Also called *Intestinal Flushing Decoction*, used for critical cases.

**False Hellebore Pill** – Treats cold damage where emesis is not induced. Formula:
- *False Hellebore* (藜芦) 1 liang
- *Aconite* (附子) 1 liang

Grind the two ingredients into powder, mix with honey into pills the size of lentils. For cold damage with loss of appetite, take two pills; increase if no effect is observed. Applicable from one to four days after onset. If no vomiting occurs after the shadow moves three *zhang*, consume hot congee to induce it.

**Wine and Gall Formula** – Treats warm disease or cold damage after three or four days, with chest discomfort and desire for emesis. Formula:
- *Pure Bitter Wine* (醇苦酒) 0.5 *sheng*
- *Pig’s Gallbladder* (猪胆) 1

Mix and drink fully; recovery follows vomiting.

**Alternative Formula** – Take 157 *Bi Lun* coins, boil in one *dou* of water until seven *sheng* remain, and administer in divided doses. Shortly after, boil the coins again in five *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, then add two *sheng* of water to make three *sheng*, remove the coins, and administer the liquid. The toxin will be expelled through vomiting, leading to recovery.

**Eighth Principle: Purgative Remedies**

**Guidelines and Formulas** – The general rule states that in autumn, purgatives should be used, with decoctions preferred over pills or powders; cease once the condition improves, without completing the full dose.

For cold damage with heat and lower abdominal fullness, where urination should be inhibited but is instead unobstructed, this indicates blood stasis—purgation is required, suitable for *Resistance-Current Pill*.

For *Greater Yang* disease with yellowing of the body, sunken and bound pulse, lower abdominal hardness and fullness, and inhibited urination—this indicates no blood stasis. If urination is unobstructed and the patient appears manic, this is a definitive blood condition, suitable for *Resistance-Awareness Decoction* for purgation.

For unresolved *Greater Yang* disease with heat binding in the bladder, where the patient appears manic, recovery follows spontaneous bleeding.

If the exterior syndrome remains unresolved, purgation should not yet be applied; first resolve the exterior. Once the exterior is resolved but the lower abdomen remains bound, purgation may then be applied.

In *Yang Brightness* disease with a slow pulse, though sweating occurs without aversion to cold, the body must feel heavy, with shortness of breath, abdominal fullness, panting, and tidal fever—this indicates the exterior is about to resolve, and purgation of the interior may proceed. If the hands and feet sweat profusely, the stool has already hardened, suitable for *Qi-Coordinating Decoction*. If sweating is copious with mild fever and aversion to cold, the exterior remains unresolved, and *Cinnamon Twig Decoction* governs it. If the fever is not tidal, *Qi-Coordinating Decoction* should not yet be given. If the abdomen is greatly distended and full without defecation, a small dose of *Qi-Coordinating Decoction* may be administered to gently harmonize the stomach qi, avoiding excessive purgation.

In *Yang Brightness* disease with tidal fever and slightly hardened stool, *Qi-Coordinating Decoction* may be given; if the stool is not hardened, it should not be administered. If there has been no defecation for six or seven days, fearing the presence of dry stool, the method to ascertain this is to administer a small dose of *Qi-Coordinating Decoction*. If there is passage of flatus, dry stool is present, and purgation may proceed; if no flatus is passed, this indicates hardness at the beginning and softness at the end, and purgation must not be applied—if forced, it will cause distension, fullness, and inability to eat. If the patient desires to drink water, this is a sign of recovery; if fever subsequently arises, the stool will surely harden again, and a small dose of *Qi-Coordinating Decoction* should be given to harmonize it. If no flatus is passed, purgation must be avoided.

In *Yang Brightness* syndrome where the patient is forgetful, there must be retained blood. The reason is that long-standing blood stasis causes forgetfulness. Though the stool may be hard, the stool will surely be black, suitable for *Resistance-Party Decoction* to purge it.

In *Yang Brightness* disease with fever and sweating, this is dispersion of heat, which cannot produce jaundice. But if only the head sweats while the body remains dry, the sweat stopping at the neck, with inhibited urination and thirst for fluids, this indicates stasis-heat in the interior, and the body will surely develop jaundice—purgation is suitable, with *Virgate Wormwood Decoction*. The formula appears in Scroll Ten.

In *Lesser Yin* disease of two or three days’ duration with dry mouth and throat, urgent purgation is required, suitable for *Qi-Coordinating Decoction*. In *Lesser Yin* disease of six or seven days’ duration with abdominal fullness and no defecation, urgent purgation is required, suitable for *Qi-Coordinating Decoction*.

Where there is repletion, there is delirious speech; where there is vacuity, there is *zheng*-voice. *Zheng*-voice is repetitive speech.

Fixed gaze, delirious speech, and panting with fullness indicate death; chronic diarrhea also indicates death.

In cold damage of four or five days’ duration with sunken pulse and panting fullness—sunken pulse indicates interior repletion—yet mistakenly inducing sweating causes fluids to escape, making defecation difficult. Exterior vacuity with interior repletion will eventually lead to delirious speech.

*Major Qi-Coordinating Decoction* governs intense heat with dry stool in the abdomen and delirious speech. The formula:
Four liang of rhubarb, eight liang of magnolia bark, five pieces of unripe bitter orange, three *ge* of mirabilite.

Grind the four ingredients, then decoct with one *dou* of water. First boil the magnolia bark and unripe bitter orange, reducing to five *sheng*; remove the dregs. Add the rhubarb and decoct to two *sheng*; remove the dregs. Add the mirabilite and boil briefly once or twice. Divide and administer in two doses; cease when rapid purgation occurs.

*Resistance-Subduing Pill* for blood descent. The formula:
Twenty leeches, twenty horseflies, twenty-two peach kernels, three liang of rhubarb.

Grind the four ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into four pills. Boil one pill in one *sheng* of water, reducing to seven *ge*, and administer in a single dose. Blood should descend within the time it takes for the pupils to move; if not, administer another dose.

*Resistance-Subduing Decoction* treats the same condition as above. The formula:
Thirty leeches, thirty horseflies, twenty-three peach kernels, three liang of rhubarb.

Grind the four ingredients, then decoct with five *sheng* of water, reducing to three *sheng*; remove the dregs. Administer one *sheng*; if no descent occurs, administer again.

Administer one dose after the time it takes a person to walk five *li*; cease when purgation occurs. If no purgation occurs, administer the full dose.

**Fresh Rehmannia Decoction** treats febrile disease with heat, deficiency and emaciation, shortness of breath, fullness below the heart, retained food in the stomach, and constipation. The formula:
Three *jin* of fresh rehmannia, four *liang* of rhubarb, one *liang* of licorice, two *ge* of *mang xiao*, twenty jujubes.

Combine the five ingredients, pound thoroughly, and steam beneath five *sheng* of rice until done. Squeeze to extract the juice and divide into two doses.

**Major Bupleurum, Solomon’s Seal, and Anemarrhena Decoction** treats unresolved febrile disease after seven or eight days, taciturnity with vexation, dry stool in the abdomen, and delirious speech. The formula:
Half a *jin* of bupleurum, two *liang* each of Solomon’s seal, anemarrhena, rhubarb, and licorice, three *liang* each of ginseng, scutellaria, and peony, five *liang* of fresh ginger, half a *sheng* of pinellia.

Crush the ten ingredients, then decoct with one *dou* of water, reducing to three *sheng*; remove the dregs. Administer one *sheng* thrice daily; efficacy is achieved when purgation occurs. The *Collected Effective Remedies* version uses four *zhi shi* and omits peony.

**Formula for Febrile Disease with Headache, High Fever, and Pain in All Joints:**
Four *liang* each of bupleurum, gardenia seed, peony, and anemarrhena, three *liang* each of cimicifuga, scutellaria, *da qing* (isatis leaf), and apricot kernel, eight *liang* of gypsum, one *sheng* of fermented soybean.

Crush the ten ingredients, then decoct with nine *sheng* of water, reducing to two *sheng* and seven *ge*; divide and administer warm in three doses. If heat is severe, add four *liang* of rhubarb.

**Fermented Soybean Pill** treats febrile disease with retained fluids and undigested food. The formula:
One *sheng* of fermented soybean, three hundred *ba dou* (croton seed) with oil removed (now using two hundred), sixty-plus apricot kernels, four *liang* each of scutellaria, coptis, rhubarb, and ephedra, three *liang* each of *mang xiao* and *gan sui* (kansui root).

Grind the nine ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of large soybeans. Administer two pills. If no purgation occurs, increase the dose.

**Ninth Pulse and Symptom Pattern After Diaphoresis, Emesis, and Purgation**

**Moxibustion Method**
For *shanghan* that has resolved for half a day but recurs with vexing heat and a floating, rapid pulse, diaphoresis may again be applied; *Guizhi Decoction* is suitable. After diaphoresis, drinking water will invariably cause panting—this must be guarded against.

**Minor Blue Dragon Decoction**
Treats *shanghan* with unresolved exterior and water-qi below the heart, causing dry retching, fever, cough, or thirst, diarrhea, hiccup, inhibited urination with lower abdominal fullness, or panting. The formula:

Crush the eight ingredients, decoct ephedra in one *dou* of water, reducing by two *sheng*; skim off the foam, add the remaining ingredients, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, administering at intervals of approximately ten *li*.
If thirst is present, remove pinellia and add three *liang* of trichosanthes; if mild diarrhea occurs, remove ephedra and add *yuanhua* (the size of a chicken egg, stir-fried until red); if hiccup is present, add one piece of aconite; if urination is inhibited with lower abdominal fullness, remove ephedra and add four *liang* of poria; if panting is present, remove ephedra and add half a *sheng* of apricot kernels. Repeated use yields divine efficacy.

Four *liang* of poria, three *liang* each of atractylodes and cinnamon twig, two *liang* of licorice.
Crush the four ingredients, decoct in six *sheng* of water, reducing to three *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses.

When the *cunkou* pulse is floating but sunken at the *guan*, this indicates chest bind. (*Chao Yuanfang’s* *General Treatise on the Origins and Symptoms of Diseases* renders it "sunken and fine.")

When *shanghan* arises in yang but is improperly purged, heat enters and forms chest bind.

**Major Chest Bind Pill**
Treats chest bind with stiff nape resembling soft tetany; purgation brings resolution. The formula:
Eight *liang* of rhubarb, five *ge* each of *mang xiao*, apricot kernels, and *tingli* seed.
Pound and sift rhubarb and *tingli* seed; grind the remaining two ingredients separately into a paste. Combine the powders, form into a pill the size of a bullet, and take with one *qianbi* of kansui powder, two *ge* of white honey, and one *sheng* of water, reducing to eight *ge*. Administer warm in one dose; if no purgation occurs, repeat until efficacy is achieved.

For *shanghan* of six or seven days with chest bind, heat repletion, a sunken and tight pulse, pain below the heart, and hardness upon pressure, *Major Chest Bind Decoction* is suitable.

If hardness below the heart is observed and the condition is mistakenly deemed unresolved, further purgation will exacerbate the binding. This is not due to bound heat but rather stomach vacuity with counterflow of guest qi. The formula:
Four *liang* of licorice, three *liang* each of scutellaria and dried ginger, one *liang* of coptis, half a *sheng* of pinellia, and twelve *da zao*.
Crush the six ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water to obtain six *sheng*, and discard the dregs.

One *sheng* of gypsum, six *liang* of anemarrhena, two *liang* of licorice, and six *ge* of non-glutinous rice.
Crush the four ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water until the rice is cooked, and discard the dregs.
Divide and administer one *sheng* three times daily.
Those with blood loss or vacuity should not take *White Tiger Decoction*. From the start of summer until the start of autumn, it may be used; after the start of autumn, it should not be administered. In the third month of spring, when it is still cold, it should also not be given, as it may induce vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

For *shanghan* without great heat but with dry mouth, thirst, vexation, and slight aversion to cold in the back, *White Tiger Decoction* is suitable.
For *shanghan* with a floating pulse, fever, and absence of sweating where the exterior is unresolved, *White Tiger Decoction* should not be given.

One version states to blend smoothly into pills.

**Indigo Decoction**

Four *liang* of indigo, two *liang* each of licorice and donkey-hide gelatin, and one *sheng* of fermented soybean.
Crush the four ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, discard the dregs, boil three times, remove the fermented soybean, and add donkey-hide gelatin to melt.
Administer one *sheng* in a single dose three times daily. When the decoction is nearly finished, prepare more to ensure a continuous supply. Those with thirst should drink.
It solely clears heat, stops vomiting and diarrhea, and is non-toxic.
The *Shenshi* version treats taxation relapse; the *Zhouhou* includes three *liang* of halloysite, and the *Huqia* and *Jiyan* versions are the same.

**Post-*Shanghan* Remnant Heat Formula**
Treats unresolved *shanghan* with morning and evening fever resembling malaria. The formula:
Two *liang* of anemarrhena, one *liang* each of ephedra, licorice, peony, scutellaria, and cinnamon twig.
Crush the six ingredients, decoct in seven *sheng* of water to obtain two and a half *sheng*.
Administer five *ge* three times daily, cover warmly to induce slight sweating.
If vexation prevents sleep and the patient desires water, allow gradual sipping to harmonize the stomach, and recovery will follow.

The masters of Jiangnan secretly withhold the essential formulas of Zhongjing and do not transmit them.

**Moxibustion Method**
At the onset of illness, if there is initial headache, aversion to cold and heat, or a sensation of chilliness prompting the desire for fire, or stiffness in the waist and back with a flushed face resembling intoxication—this is the first or second day of *shanghan*. Apply strong fire moxibustion to three points below the heart:
First point: one *cun* below the heart, named *Juque*.
Second point: two *cun* below the heart, named *Shangguan*.
Third point: three *cun* below the heart, named *Weiguan*.
Moxa each point with fifty cones.
However, as people vary in size, the *cun* measurements may differ; using a string to measure according to individual length is best. Place the string at the tip of the xiphoid process (named *Jiuwei*), extend it to the navel, fold it in half, and the end marks *Weiguan*; fold it in half again, divide into two equal parts, and measure one part upward from *Weiguan* to locate *Shangguan*, then measure another part upward to locate *Juque*.
Adults may receive fifty cones; children may receive three, adjusted according to age.

The size of the moxa cones should be determined by discretion. If the patient has been ill for three or four days or more, first apply twenty cones of moxibustion to the chest.

Measure a string from the center of the nose straight up to the hairline, fold it in half, and cut off one portion. Then, starting from the hairline, enter into the hair and moxa the end of the string, naming this point *Tiancong*. Also moxa both temples (□), both *Fengchi* points, and the *Ganshu* point with one hundred cones. Apply twenty cones to the remaining points, and moxa *Taichong* with thirty cones—this is divinely effective.

**On Cold Damage Formulas**
**Miscellaneous Treatments for Cold Damage, Chapter One**
**Moxibustion Methods**

It is said: To eliminate heat and resolve toxins, nothing surpasses bitter and sour substances. Thus, one often employs *ku shen* (苦参), *qing xiang* (青葙), mugwort (*ai*, 艾), gardenia (*zhi zi*, 栀子), *ting li* (葶苈), bitter wine, and dark plum (*wu mei*, 乌梅)—these are the essentials. When heat is severe, it cannot be resolved without bitter and sour substances. If heat lingers within the body and is not treated in time, or if treatment employs no such bitter and sour medicines, this is like extinguishing fire without water—escape is impossible.

It is further said: Many current treatments rely on acrid and sweet ingredients, such as ginger, cinnamon, and ginseng, all of which are costly and difficult to obtain. Often, one must travel far to seek them, thus losing the opportunity for timely treatment. Yet *ku shen*, *qing xiang*, *ting li*, and mugwort are found everywhere, and their efficacy in eliminating heat and resolving toxins surpasses that of expensive medicines. These may be used repeatedly, before or after other treatments.

For internal heat disorders, one need not adhere strictly to the sequence of medicines. Simply administer *qing xiang*, *ku shen*, mugwort, and bitter wine, adjusting the intervals slightly—none will fail to resolve the condition.

Bian Que said: If the illness lies in the interstices (*cou li*, 腠理), it may be reached by decoctions and compresses; if in the blood vessels, by acupuncture and stone needles; if in the bone marrow, there is nothing to be done. Yet some physicians claim one should wait until the disease has fully developed before abruptly removing it—this is folly. One should instruct one’s household and retainers in advance, explaining this principle so that those who fall ill may understand its importance.

**Formula for Treating Warm-Qi Disease on the Verge of Death:**
One *liang* of *ku shen*, simmered in two *sheng* of wine until reduced to one *sheng*. Drink it all at once. Vomiting will expel all toxic illnesses. Cover the patient to induce sweating—all will be cured.

Zhang Wenzhong and *Zhouhou Fang* state: For death from heat-toxin qi, the "Breaking the Coffin Thousand-Gold Decoction" is used. The *Ku Shen Decoction* for treating heat illness of five or six days or more is as follows:

**Frozen Snow Decoction** for treating epidemic toxic illness of seven or eight days, with heat accumulating in the chest, vexation, and near-death:
One *sheng* of *yuan hua* (芫花), decocted in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one and a half *sheng*. Soak an old cloth in the liquid and apply thinly to the chest. No more than three applications will eliminate the heat. Warm the limbs to prevent counterflow cold (*jue ni*, 厥逆).

**Gua Lou Decoction** for treating cold damage or wind strike of five or six days or more, with only chest vexation and dry retching:

Three *liang* of fresh ginger
Decoct two *zhi* of *qian li xie di* (千里鞋底) in seven *sheng* of water until reduced to five *sheng*. Strain the liquid, add the remaining ingredients, and decoct until reduced to two and a half *sheng*. Drink as desired. If not cured, prepare again until recovery.

Pound the five ingredients, then decoct in one *dou* of water until reduced to six *sheng*. Strain, add one *sheng* of polished rice, and cook until the rice is done. Take one *sheng* three times daily.
One variant adds five *liang* of fresh ginger. This is precisely Master Zhang Zhongjing’s *Zhu Ye Decoction*, which appears in the earlier chapter on post-sweating treatments, though it omits licorice and specifies no dosage.

**Second Discourse on Taxation Relapse**
**Dietary Prohibitions**
**Formulas**

**Discourse on Dietary Prohibitions**

It is said: In all cases of febrile disease newly recovered or following major illness, consuming pork, sheep’s blood, fatty fish, greasy foods, or the like will invariably lead to severe diarrhea, which physicians cannot cure and will surely result in death. If one eats pastries, glutinous millet, maltose sweets, raw or roasted meats, jujubes, chestnuts, preserved fruits, dried meats, or other hard, indigestible foods, the stomach qi remains weak and unable to digest them, inevitably causing renewed heat bind. If purgatives are then administered, the stomach qi becomes cold and vacuous, and severe diarrhea will be uncontrollable. Not purging leads to death, while purging brings peril—both are difficult to remedy. Many die after febrile or major illness due to such causes; one cannot be too cautious.

After recent recovery from illness, one should only consume thin rice porridge, eating sparingly to maintain slight hunger and carefully avoiding fullness. No other foods should be taken, even if craved—do not yield to such desires. As days pass, one may gradually introduce white porridge with mutton, broths, pheasant, rabbit, or venison, but pork and dog meat must not be eaten.

After recent recovery, one should rest quietly and avoid rising early to wash the face or comb the hair. Not only does this strain the body, but excessive speech, mental exertion, or emotional agitation will also cause relapse. Thus, when Attendant Officer Gu Zi-xian had recovered from illness but remained weak, he visited Hua Fu for pulse diagnosis. Hua Fu said: “Though recovered, you are still vacuous and not fully restored. Your yang qi is insufficient—take care not to overexert. Ordinary labor is tolerable, but sexual activity will be fatal, causing the tongue to protrude several inches.” When his wife, having heard of his recovery, traveled over a hundred *li* to visit him and they engaged in intercourse after a night’s rest, he developed fever and lockjaw three days later, and died with his tongue protruding several inches.

If one engages in sexual activity before a hundred days have passed after recent recovery from illness, when qi and strength have not yet returned to normal, death will almost certainly follow. There was a scholar named Gai Zheng who, sixty days after recovering from illness, had regained enough strength to hunt, but died after intercourse, vomiting saliva. Engaging in sexual activity after febrile illness is called *yin-yang exchange disease*, which is difficult to treat and often fatal.

Recently, a certain official had a mild case of cold damage. Ten days after recovery, he was able to ride a horse, believing himself fully restored. After intercourse, he developed acute lower abdominal pain, limb spasms, and died.

If one eats any meat or wheat-based foods within five days of recovery from seasonal illness, the disease will relapse, causing severe distress. If one drinks wine or eats Chinese chives after recent recovery from seasonal illness, the disease will recur. If one eats raw fish with vinegar after recent recovery from seasonal illness, diarrhea will be unstoppable. If one eats raw vegetables after recent recovery from seasonal illness, the complexion will never fully return to normal. If one drinks cold water after recent resolution of illness through sweating, the pericardium will be harmed, causing vacuity that cannot be restored even with supplementation. If one eats raw jujubes or mutton after recent recovery from seasonal illness, heat will accumulate in the diaphragm. If one eats dog or sheep meat after recent recovery from malaria, heat will steam within the bones. If one eats fish, meat, melons, or raw vegetables after recent recovery from seasonal illness, the body will become feverish. (One version reads: “swollen.”) If one eats garlic with raw fish after recent recovery from seasonal illness, the disease will relapse, leading to severe distress.

**Discourse on Women’s Warm Disease and Relapse Through Intercourse:**
Though a woman’s warm disease may have abated, if she has not fully recovered, her blood and vessels remain unsettled, and residual heat-toxin persists. Should she engage in intercourse at this time, the resulting illness is termed *yin-yi* (relapsing through yin). The patient will experience bodily heaviness, heat surging into the chest, head too heavy to lift, and a film (or membrane) forming in the eyes. The limbs (or, in some versions, the sinews of the knees) become rigidly contracted, the lower abdomen twists with pain, and the hands and feet clench into fists—all signs portending immediate death. Some may not die at once but will suffer from urgent tension in the lower abdomen, heat rushing into the chest, a head too heavy to lift, joints loosening as if dislocated, meridians slackening, blood and qi depleted, marrow exhausted, breath shallow and labored, strength waning, and the body so enfeebled as to require assistance even to shift in bed. Such patients may linger for months or years before succumbing.

Physician Zhang Miao recounted a case: a maidservant, still weak days after recovery, was violated by six men—all of whom perished.

**Formula for Women Who Relapse Through Intercourse with a Recovering Man, or for Men Who Relapse Through Intercourse with a Recovering Woman:**
Take a woman’s undergarment string from near the private area, burn it, and administer one *fangcunbi* of the ash. After three days, if urination becomes smooth and the glans swells slightly, this signals recovery. For a woman’s relapse, use a man’s pubic hair in the same manner.

**Formula for Relapse Due to Intercourse (with Swollen, Retracted Testicles and Excruciating Abdominal Pain):**
Take the clothing worn by the woman during intercourse and cover the man with it—he will recover immediately.

**Formula to Prevent Relapse:**
Burn twenty of the woman’s fingernails and toenails, along with a one-*chi* length of her undergarment belt. Administer the ash with wine or rice-water decoction.

**Formula for Men Who Relapse After Resuming Intercourse Too Soon After Recovery:**
Burn a cloth stained with menstrual blood and take one *fangcunbi* of the ash. This also treats swollen, retracted testicles with agonizing abdominal pain.

**Method for Untangling Matted Hair After Illness:**
Take two *sheng* of raw sesame oil, loosen the patient’s hair, place it in a copper sieve, and soak it thoroughly with the oil. Gently comb through with a hairpin—soon the tangles will unravel of their own accord.

**Third Discourse on Lily Disease**
**Formulas and Discourse:**
Lily disease (*baihe bing*) arises when no single meridian is affected, but all the hundred vessels, originating from one source, become diseased. It typically follows unresolved *cold damage* or consumptive illness. Its manifestations vary by location:
- If the patient suffers aversion to cold and vomiting, the disease lies in the upper burner and will resolve in twenty-three days.
- If the patient has abdominal fullness, mild panting, hard stools passed every three or four days, or occasional loose stools, the disease lies in the middle burner and will resolve in sixty-three days.
- If the patient has difficult, dribbling urination, the disease lies in the lower burner and will resolve in thirty-three days.
Treatment must be tailored to the specific pattern.

The nature of lily disease is such that the patient may crave food yet be unable to eat, or may find food appealing at times and repulsive at others. Though they may feel chilled, there is no true cold; though they may feel feverish, there is no true heat. They remain silent, longing to lie down but unable to sleep. By morning, their mouth tastes bitter, their urine is dark and scant, and they may feel the urge to move yet lack the strength. No medicine can cure it; attempts at treatment only provoke severe vomiting and diarrhea, as if possessed by spirits.

In lily disease, the body appears harmonious, but the pulse is faint and rapid. If the patient’s head aches during urination, recovery will take sixty days. If, during urination, the head does not ache but the patient feels chilled, recovery will take forty days. If, during urination, the patient feels relief but experiences dizziness, recovery will take twenty days.

The signs of lily disease may appear before illness onset, within four or five days of falling ill, or even twenty days later. Misdiagnosis is common, so careful differentiation is essential.

**Discourse on Treatment Principles:**
If lily disease manifests in yin but is treated by attacking yang, the yin aspect will not resolve, and inducing sweating will be counterproductive. If it manifests in yang but is treated by attacking yin, the yang aspect will not resolve, and purging will fail to cure the disease. As the *Essentials* states: "For disease in yin, rescue with yang methods; for disease in yang, resolve with yin methods." Attacking yin when the disease is in yang, or inducing sweating after such an attack, is counterproductive and makes the disease difficult to cure. Attacking yang when the disease is in yin, or purging after such an attack, is equally counterproductive and renders the disease intractable.

### **Formulas for Cold Damage**
#### **Fox-Confusion Disease Developing from Failure to Induce Sweating (Fourth Discussion)**
**Discussion:**
Fox-Confusion Disease resembles Cold Damage. The patient becomes taciturn and drowsy, yet cannot close their eyes, and is restless whether lying or rising. If the toxin lodges in the throat, it is called *Confusion Disease*; if in the yin anus, it is called *Fox Disease*.

In Fox-Confusion Disease, the patient loathes food and drink, refusing to eat upon smelling food. Their complexion may flush red, pale white, or darken. If the toxin consumes the upper body, the voice becomes hoarse (hoarseness, variant: *gagging*); if it consumes the lower body, the throat becomes dry.

This arises from warm-toxin *qi*. For toxin in the upper body, *Drain the Heart Decoction* governs it; for toxin in the lower body, soak and wash with *Sophora Decoction*; for toxin at the external anus, fumigate it. Use three pieces of realgar, placed in an earthen jar over charcoal fire, and direct the fumes toward the anus, while also administering the decoction.

**Decoction for Fox-Confusion:**
- Coptis: 4 *liang*
- *Xun* grass: 4 *liang*

Bruise the two ingredients, steep in one *dou* of white vinegar water overnight, then boil to yield two *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

**Red Adzuki Bean and Chinese Angelica Powder:**
For patients with rapid pulse, no fever, mild vexation, taciturnity, desire to lie down, and sweating—if the eyes become red as a turtledove’s within the first three or four days, or if the four canthi turn yellow-black by seven or eight days, and the patient can eat, pus has already formed. The treatment formula:

Soak three *sheng* of red adzuki beans until they sprout sufficiently, then dry them. Add three *liang* of Chinese angelica, and grind into powder. Administer one square-inch spoonful with fermented water, three times daily, and recovery will follow.

**Drain the Heart Decoction:**
When the disease presentation forbids attack or moxibustion—if fire is used as a pathogenic factor, blood scatters within the vessels. Injury to the vessels is still manageable; injury to the viscera is severe. Well and stream points swell, yellow fluid oozes, channels and network vessels ulcerate externally, and flesh putrefies into abscesses and pus—this is *Fire Impetigo*, an injury caused by physicians.

Patients with rapid pulse must not undergo moxibustion. If fire is used as a pathogenic factor, vexation arises; if deficiency is pursued with excess, blood rushes within the vessels. Though fire’s *qi* is subtle, its internal attack is forceful, scorching bones and damaging sinews, making blood difficult to restore. Treatment should focus on draining the heart.

**Drain the Heart Decoction** also treats incessant diarrhea with abdominal hardness, vexation, vomiting, and borborygmus. (Master Jing calls it *Pinellia Drain the Heart Decoction*; the *Essentials* calls it *Licorice Drain the Heart*.)
- Pinellia: half *sheng*
- Scutellaria: 3 *liang*
- Ginseng: 3 *liang*
- Dried ginger: 3 *liang*
- Licorice: 3 *liang*
- Coptis: 1 *liang*
- Jujube: 12 pieces

Bruise the seven ingredients, boil in one *dou* of water to yield six *sheng*. Divide and administer one *sheng* three times daily.

### **Jaundice from Cold Damage (Fifth Discussion)**
**Symptoms and Formulas**
**Discussion:**
There are five types of jaundice: *Yellow Sweat*, *Yellow Jaundice*, *Grain Jaundice*, *Wine Jaundice*, and *Female Taxation Jaundice*.

**Yellow Sweat:**
The body and limbs are slightly swollen, the chest full without thirst, and sweat exudes like the juice of *Phellodendron*. This arises from profuse sweating followed by sudden immersion in water.

**Yellow Jaundice:**
The entire body and face turn yellow like an orange or pomelo. It arises from sudden heat followed by washing with cold water, causing heat to linger in the stomach, or from eating raw cucumbers or steaming. If it progresses to *Black Jaundice*, death is common.

**Grain Jaundice:**
After eating, the patient experiences dizziness, palpitations, and restlessness. The face turns yellow, caused by eating excessively while famished, with stomach *qi* surging upward.

**Wine Jaundice:**
The patient feels vexing pain in the heart, fullness in the feet and legs, yellow urine, and a face marked with red, yellow, and black macules. This arises from heavy intoxication followed by exposure to wind and water.

**Female Taxation Jaundice:**
The body and eyes turn yellow, with fever, aversion to cold, lower abdominal fullness and tension, and difficult urination. This arises from extreme fatigue and heat followed by intercourse and immersion in water.

Treat according to the following formulas.

**Yellow Sweat Disease:**
The body swells severely, with fever, sweating, and no thirst, resembling *Wind-Water*. Sweat stains clothes a true yellow, like *Phellodendron* juice. The pulse is inherently deep. How is this disease contracted? It arises from sweating followed by bathing in water, which enters through the sweat pores.

**Astragalus, Peony, and Cinnamon Wine Decoction** for Yellow Sweat:
- Astragalus: 5 *liang*
- Peony: 3 *liang*
- Cinnamon heart: 3 *liang*

Bruise the three ingredients, combine with one *sheng* of bitter wine and seven *sheng* of water, and boil to yield three *sheng*. Drink one *sheng*; by the sixth or seventh day, vexation will gradually resolve. Vexation arises from the obstruction of bitter wine.

**Yellow Jaundice Disease:**
If the patient is thirsty, the disease is difficult to treat; if not thirsty, it is treatable. If it arises in the yin aspect, the patient will vomit; if in the yang aspect, the patient will experience shivering and mild fever.

**Cinnamon and Astragalus Decoction** for all types of jaundice, suitable for promoting urination. If the pulse is floating, resolution should come through sweating:
- Cinnamon: 3 *liang*
- Peony: 3 *liang*
- Fresh ginger: 3 *liang*
- Licorice: 2 *liang*
- Astragalus: 5 *liang*
- Jujube: 12 pieces

Bruise the six ingredients, boil in eight *sheng* of water over a mild fire to yield three *sheng*, and remove the dregs. Administer one *sheng* warm to induce mild sweating.

If sweating does not occur shortly after administration, have the patient drink thin hot gruel to assist the decoction; if still no sweat, administer the decoction again.

**Ephedra and Pure Wine Decoction** for treating cold damage with heat effusing outward, causing jaundice:
- Ephedra: 3 *liang*
Boil in five *sheng* of pure wine to yield one and a half *sheng*, then consume entirely. Cover warmly to induce sweating, and recovery will follow. In winter or cold months, use clear wine; in spring, water is suitable.

**Jaundice Remedy:**
- Melon pedicel: 2 × 7 pieces
- Glutinous millet: 2 × 7 pieces
- Adzuki beans: 2 × 7 pieces
Grind the three ingredients into a fine powder. For severe cases, take an amount equivalent to two large soybeans and insert into the nostrils, causing nasal pain and contraction. Shortly after, yellow fluid will discharge—either from the nose or mouth—yielding one *sheng* or more, and the patient will recover. For mild cases, use one soybean’s worth; if unresolved, repeat after a day. In some regions, a tube is used to forcefully blow the powder into the nostrils, but this risks fatality—exercise extreme caution.

**From *Shanfan*:**
For epidemic toxic heat penetrating the viscera and marrow, manifesting as yellow jaundice, black jaundice, red jaundice, white jaundice, grain jaundice, or *mahuang* disease, with labored breathing that persists without cease:

**Rhubarb Pill**, for the same conditions as above:
- Rhubarb: 2 *liang*
- Tingli seed: 2 *liang*
Grind into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take ten pills before meals, three times daily; discontinue when the condition resolves.

**Alternative Formula:**
- Rhubarb: 2 *liang*
- Coptis: 3 *liang*
- Phellodendron: 1 *liang*
- Scutellaria: 1 *liang*
- Fermented leaven: 5 *ge*
Grind into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take three pills before meals, three times daily; if no effect, increase to five pills.

**Virgate Wormwood Decoction** for jaundice, where the body and eyes are entirely yellow:
- Virgate wormwood: 3 *liang*
- Coptis: 3 *liang*
- Scutellaria: 2 *liang*
- Rhubarb: 1 *liang*
- Licorice: 1 *liang*
- Ginseng: 1 *liang*
- Gardenia: 2 × 7 pieces
Bruise the seven ingredients, boil in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, and divide into three doses, taken thrice daily. Also treats alcohol-induced jaundice and alcohol accumulation.

**Three Yellows Powder**, for the same conditions as above:
- Rhubarb: 4 *liang*
- Coptis: 4 *liang*
- Scutellaria: 4 *liang*
Grind into a fine powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful before meals, three times daily. Can also be formed into pills.

**Five Ling Powder** for jaundice, promoting urination:
- Polyporus: 3 *zhu*
- Poria: 3 *zhu*
- Alisma: 3 *zhu*
- Atractylodes: 3 *zhu*
- Cinnamon bark: 3 *zhu*
Pound and sift into a powder. When thirsty, take one square *cun* spoonful with water, drink copiously, and urination or sweating will resolve the condition. This formula is repeated from Volume Nine, with differing dosages.

**Prickly Ash Powder** for jaundice with scant drinking but copious urination:
- Prickly ash: 6 *zhu*
- Melon pedicel: ½ *liang*
Grind into a fine powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful with water, three times daily.

**Minor Pinellia Decoction** for jaundice where urine color is unchanged, with spontaneous diarrhea, abdominal fullness, and panting—heat should not be purged, as its removal will induce hiccups:
- Pinellia: ½ *jin*
- Fresh ginger: ½ *jin*
Bruise the two ingredients, boil in seven *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng* and five *ge*, and divide into two doses. There was a case of a person who died from chronic qi stagnation, their heart still warm; a small amount of this decoction’s liquid was dripped into their mouth, and they revived.

**Jaundice Remedy:**
Take fresh wheat seedlings, pound to extract the juice, and drink six to seven *ge*, three to four times day and night. Recovery occurs in three to four days. If wheat seedlings are unavailable, barley seedlings may be used.

**Remedy for Yellow Jaundice Turning into Black Jaundice, Untreatable by Physicians:**
Pound *tugua* root to extract one small *sheng* of juice and consume it all at once, once daily in the early morning. By mealtime, the disease will discharge through the urine. First assess the patient’s strength; do not administer excessively, as weakness may prevent them from rising.

**Remedy for Jaundice Where Body, Face, and Eyes Turn Golden, Urine Like Concentrated Phellodendron Decoction, Untreatable by Physicians:**
- Virgate wormwood: 4 *liang*
- Gardenia: 4 *liang*
- Scutellaria: 3 *liang*
- Rhubarb: 3 *liang*
- Bupleurum: 3 *liang*
- Cimicifuga: 3 *liang*
- Gentian: 2 *liang*
Bruise the seven ingredients, boil in eight *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng* and seven *ge*, and divide into three doses. If the body is emaciated, omit rhubarb and add five to six *liang* of gardenia and one *sheng* of fresh rehmannia.
*Yannian Milu* omits virgate wormwood and includes four *liang* of gardenia, three *liang* of trichosanthes, and two *liang* of mirabilite.
*Jinxiao Fang* adds two *liang* of unripe bitter orange.

If jaundice persists for a long time, turning peach-blossom colored, with hardness below the heart, retching, inability to eat, extremely scant dark urine, cold limbs, and a deep, faint, slow pulse, this formula is unsuitable—purging will induce *wan* disease. Instead, administer **Major Virgate Wormwood Decoction**, omitting rhubarb and adding five *liang* of fresh rehmannia. After consuming the decoction, observe the pulse: if it becomes slightly floating and the body shows minor signs, no longer deeply faint, treatment is possible. When the pulse becomes floating, the yellow hue will brighten, no longer peach-blossom colored, and the hardness below the heart will resolve. The formula for **Major Virgate Wormwood Decoction** follows the eleven-ingredient version below.

**Sophora Powder** for sudden onset of shivering and jaundice, with yellow dust-like skin, scant dark urine, occasional constipation, normal strength, and unaffected appetite—after other decoctions and powders fail to resolve residual heat in long-standing jaundice, inducing vomiting and purging:
- Sophora: 1 *liang*
- Coptis: 1 *liang*
- Melon pedicel: 1 *liang*
- Phellodendron: 1 *liang*
- Rhubarb: 1 *liang*
- Tingli seed: 2 *liang*
Grind into a fine powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful with water to induce severe vomiting. If vomiting occurs, take once daily; if not, take twice. Some relief should appear after five days; if not, continue administration and adjust as needed. Minor setbacks may require further adjustment.

**Formulas for Treating Jaundice**

- Virgate wormwood: 3 *liang*
- Phellodendron: 3 *liang*
- Gardenia: 3 *liang*

**Virgate Wormwood Decoction** for treating cold damage of seven or eight days, with internal repletion and stagnant heat binding, where the body turns orange-yellow, urination is inhibited, and the abdomen is slightly distended and full—suitable for purgation:
- Virgate wormwood: 6 *liang*
- Rhubarb: 3 *liang*
- Gardenia: 40 pieces
Chop the three ingredients, boil virgate wormwood in one *dou* and two *sheng* of water, reduce to five *sheng*, strain, then add gardenia and rhubarb, and reduce to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses of one *sheng* each, taken thrice daily. Urine should flow like soapberry foam, deep red in color, with abdominal distension relieved and jaundice fully resolved through urination. Fan Wang used this to treat grain jaundice; *Minor Formulas* adds one *jin* of gypsum.

**Rhubarb and Phellodendron Decoction** for treating jaundice with abdominal fullness, inhibited and red urination, and spontaneous sweating—where the exterior is harmonized but the interior is replete, suitable for purgation:
- Rhubarb: 3 *liang*
- Phellodendron: 4 *liang*
- Mirabilite: 4 *liang*
- Gardenia: 15 pieces
Chop the four ingredients, boil in six *sheng* of water, reduce to two *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and reduce further to one *sheng*. Take on an empty stomach in one dose.

- Fermented soybeans: 5 *liang*
- Rhubarb: 5 *liang*
Grind into powder, form into malt-sugar pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take three pills with water; vomiting and purgation indicate efficacy. If no effect, increase by one pill. At the first sign of bodily discomfort, administer immediately for rapid resolution—divinely effective.

**Formula for Acute Jaundice with Heat Qi and Steaming Bones, Red Veins in Both Eyes:**
- Mirabilite: 1 *liang*
- Rhubarb (powdered): 1.5 *liang*
- Fresh rehmannia juice: 8 *ge*
Combine. Take five *ge* per dose, twice daily, until purgation occurs; a second dose is unnecessary.

**Formula for Wind Jaundice, with Yellow or White Urine, Chills and Fever, Preference for Lying Down, and Aversion to Movement:**
- Fresh mugwort harvested in the third month: 1 bundle (pounded to extract juice)
- Simmer in a bronze vessel until lacquer-like, seal tightly.
- Rhubarb: 6 *zhu*
- Coptis: 6 *zhu*
- Calcitum: 6 *zhu*
- Trichosanthes root: 6 *zhu*
- Sophora: 6 *zhu*
- Tingli seed: 6 *zhu*
Grind the six ingredients into powder, mix with mugwort decoction, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take five pills before meals, twice daily, increasing to twenty pills as needed. For heat, add sophora; for thirst, add trichosanthes; for inhibited urination, add tingli seed; for copious urination, add calcitum; for white urine, add coptis; for difficult defecation, add rhubarb.

**Wet Jaundice** presents initially with generalized pain and fever, a dark yellow complexion, and after seven or eight days, vigorous heat in the interior with blood—requiring purgation to expel it like pig’s liver. If the lower abdomen is full, urgent purgation is needed.

**Formula for Generalized Jaundice, Yellow Eyes, Abdominal Fullness, and Inhibited Urination:**
- Alum: 5 *liang*
- Talc: 5 *liang*
Grind into powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful with barley porridge juice, thrice daily before meals. When stool resembles blood, sweating will resolve the condition.

When the *cunkou* pulse is floating and moderate: floating indicates wind, moderation indicates impediment. This impediment is not wind stroke but vexation in the four limbs. The spleen’s color must turn yellow, and stagnant heat will circulate.

When the *fuyang* pulse is tight and rapid: rapidity indicates heat, which consumes grain; tightness indicates cold, causing fullness after eating.

A floating *chi* pulse indicates kidney damage; a tight *fuyang* pulse indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold contend, eating grain induces dizziness. Grain qi fails to transform, the stomach suffers turbidity, turbid qi flows downward, urination is obstructed, and yin is encumbered by cold. Heat flows into the bladder, and the body turns entirely yellow—this is called grain jaundice.

**Pills for Taxation Jaundice and Grain Jaundice:**
- Sophora: 3 *liang*
- Gentian: 1 *liang*
Grind into powder, mix with ox bile, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take five pills before meals with barley porridge water, thrice daily. If no effect, gradually increase the dose. *Comprehensive Formulas* adds twenty-one gardenia kernels, forming pills with pig bile.

**For Wine Jaundice:** If the pulse is floating, first induce vomiting; if deep and wiry, first induce purgation.

For those with wine jaundice, some exhibit no heat, speak clearly, and experience abdominal fullness with nausea—suitable for vomiting. The seven-ingredient **Sophora Powder** (previously described) is appropriate.

Wine jaundice must involve inhibited urination, with signs including heat in the heart and heat in the soles of the feet.

If wine jaundice is purged over time, it may transform into black jaundice, with green eyes, a black complexion, a sensation of eating garlic mash in the heart, black stool, numbness in the skin and nails, and a floating, weak pulse. Though the color is black, a faint yellow hue confirms its nature.

**Unripe Bitter Orange and Rhubarb Decoction (#9):** Treats cold damage from wine, where food intake is scant but drinking abundant, phlegm binds and jaundice arises, with heart vexation yet no severe heat, or dry retching. Ingredients:
Five pieces of unripe bitter orange,

*The Thousand Gold Wings* adds one *liang* of coptis and eighteen *zhu* of rhubarb, naming it **Oriental Wormwood Pill**, to treat black jaundice with darkening body, inhibited urination.

**Pinellia Decoction:** Treats wine accumulations shadowing the chest, heart distension and fullness, heaviness in bones and flesh, counterflow harming food intake, even to reddish-yellow urine, this rooted in vacuity taxation from wind-cold, food counterflowing to the heart, caused by internal phlegm in the spleen and stomach. Ingredients:
One *sheng* of pinellia,
One *liang* each of fresh ginger, scutellaria, oriental wormwood, Chinese angelica,
Two *liang* each of peucedanum, unripe bitter orange, licorice, euphorbia,
Three *liang* each of poria, white atractylodes.

Take one pill; if after moving six or seven *chi* there is no effect, take another, up to eight pills. Above the diaphragm, vomiting; below, purgation. Some recover without vomiting.

**Major Oriental Wormwood Decoction:** Treats internal repletion with exuberant heat and jaundice, yellow as gold, with floating, large, slippery, replete, tight, or rapid pulses. Jaundice often arises in wine drinkers with taxation heat, scant food, stomach heat, or warm toxin with internal heat, hence yellow as gold. Ingredients:
One and a half *liang* each of oriental wormwood, phellodendron,
Three *liang* each of rhubarb, white atractylodes,
Two *liang* each of scutellaria, licorice, poria, trichosanthes root, peucedanum, unripe bitter orange,

Four *liang* each of oriental wormwood, asparagus root, gardenia,
Three *liang* each of rhubarb, cinnamon heart,
Two *liang* each of rice-paper plant pith, gypsum,
Half a *sheng* of pinellia.
Steam rhubarb, rice-paper plant pith, asparagus root, pinellia, and gardenia, then dry in the sun. Grind together, form honey pills the size of soybeans. Take three pills, thrice daily. Avoid raw fish; take with bean broth, not wine. One formula omits gypsum, adding two *liang* of talc. If no effect, increase to ten pills.

In yellowing households, heat arises at dusk with aversion to cold—this is female taxation. It arises when the bladder is tense, the lesser abdomen full, the entire body yellow, the forehead black, and the soles of the feet hot, leading to black jaundice. The abdomen is drum-distended and full, as if about to produce water, the stool necessarily black, sometimes sloppy diarrhea—this is female taxation jaundice, not water. Abdominal fullness makes it difficult to treat.

**Niter and Alum Powder:** Treats female taxation jaundice. Ingredients:
Half a *liang* each of niter, alum.
Grind to powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful with barley gruel, thrice daily. Cover with heavy clothing to induce sweating. The illness exits with the stool and urine—urine properly yellow, stool properly black.

Jaundice as a disease: heat arises at dusk with aversion to cold, the lesser abdomen tense, the body yellow, the forehead black, stool sloppy and black, the soles of the feet hot—this is female taxation. Abdominal fullness makes it difficult to treat. Treatment formula:
Equal parts talc and gypsum.

Grind the two ingredients to powder. Take one square *cun* spoonful with barley gruel thrice daily; when urination becomes copious, the illness resolves.

**On Cold Damage Formulas: Treatise on Warm Malaria, Sixth Discussion**
**Formulas, Moxibustion and Acupuncture Methods, Malaria-Exorcising Rites, and Talismans**

The Master said: Malaria arises entirely from wind. When summer injures one with heat, autumn brings forth □-malaria.

Question: Why does malaria first manifest with chills and then with fever?
Answer: Chills arise from yin qi, while wind arises from yang qi. When one is first injured by cold and then by wind, the result is chills followed by fever. As the illness strikes at regular intervals, it is called cold malaria.

Question: Why does malaria first manifest with fever and then with chills?
Answer: When one is first injured by wind and then by cold, the result is fever followed by chills. This, too, strikes at regular intervals and is called warm malaria. In cases where there is only fever without chills, yin qi has first been exhausted, and yang qi acts alone. This causes shortness of breath, vexation, oppression, heat in the hands and feet, and a desire to retch. It is called *dān*-malaria.

Question: Where does the pathogen lodge in warm malaria and cold malaria?
Answer: Warm malaria arises from being struck by wind-cold in winter, with the pathogen concealed in the bone marrow. When spring arrives, yang qi flourishes, and the pathogen cannot emerge on its own. Upon encountering intense summer heat, the brain marrow melts, the flesh wastes away, and the interstices open to discharge. If one then exerts effort, the pathogen exits with sweat. This illness begins with the pathogen hidden in the kidneys, its qi first moving from within to without. In this way, yin becomes deficient and yang excessive, and excess leads to illness. When the pathogen later returns inward, yang becomes deficient, and deficiency leads to cold. Thus, fever precedes chills, and it is called warm malaria.

Question: What of *dān*-malaria?
Answer: In *dān*-malaria, the lungs inherently harbor heat, and qi flourishes throughout the body. Reversal counterflow surges upward, and the center becomes replete without outward discharge. When one exerts effort, the interstices open, and wind-cold lodges within the skin and between the flesh. When the illness strikes, yang qi flourishes, and if it does not wane, illness results. Since the qi does not reach yin, there is only fever without chills. The qi is stored internally in the heart and externally lodges between the flesh, causing the person to waste away and lose muscle. Thus, it is called *dān*-malaria.

When malaria strikes at dawn, yin and yang shift at dawn, and the illness must begin in the four limbs. Yang has already been injured, and yin follows, so the qi has not yet converged. About the time it takes to eat a meal before the onset, tightly bind the fingers and toes of the hands and feet with fine left-spun hemp rope to prevent the pathogen from entering and yin qi from exiting. Remove the bindings after the time has passed.

The pulse in malaria is inherently wiry. A wiry and rapid pulse indicates predominance of heat; a wiry and slow pulse indicates predominance of cold. A wiry and slightly tight pulse may be treated with purgation; a wiry and slow pulse may be warmed. If the pulse is tight and rapid, promote sweating and apply acupuncture or moxibustion. If the pulse is floating and large, induce vomiting to bring resolution. A wiry and rapid pulse indicates wind activation, which may be managed by regulating food and drink.

If malaria strikes yearly for three years, or monthly without resolution, it is due to a glomus beneath the ribs. In treating it, one must not attack the glomus but only deplete the fluids. Promote sweating before the time of onset. After taking the decoction, if slight chills appear, cover oneself with clothing. When sweating occurs and urination becomes smooth, recovery follows.

In malaria, the patient becomes emaciated, and the skin invariably develops goosebumps. If malaria strikes once daily, it should resolve in fifteen days. If it does not resolve, it should abate by the end of the month. If it still does not resolve, what is to be done?
The Master said: This illness has congealed into a *zhēng*-*jiǎ* mass, called a malaria mother. It must be treated urgently. The *Bie Jia Jian Wan* governs it.

**Formula: *Bie Jia Jian Wan***
Take twelve *jin* of prepared soft-shelled turtle (processed as for eating; *Essential Prescriptions* uses three *liang* of turtle shell), six *zhū* each of pinellia, ginseng, and *dàjǐ*, and twelve *zhū* each of *qúmài*, donkey-hide gelatin, *zǐwēi* (or *zǐwǎn*), moutan root bark, *shíwéi*, dried ginger, rhubarb, magnolia bark, cinnamon bark, and *hǎizǎo* (*Essential Prescriptions* uses *chìxiāo*), *tínglì*, and dung beetle; one *liang* each of wasp nest, peach kernel, and peony; one and a half *liang* of bupleurum; eighteen *zhū* each of charred *wūyǔ* (or *wūshàn*) and scutellaria; and thirty *zhū* each of ground beetle and gadfly (*Essential Prescriptions* uses *shǔfù*).
Grind the twenty-four ingredients into powder. Take one *dǒu* of ash from beneath a forge and one *hú* and five *dǒu* of clear wine. Steep the ash in the wine, then use the wine to cook the turtle until thoroughly softened, like lacquer. Strain to remove the dregs, add the other ingredients, and simmer to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take seven pills on an empty stomach, three times daily.
*Zhang Zhongjing’s* formula omits *dàjǐ* and *hǎizǎo*.

**Formula: *Chai Hu Gua Lou Gen Tang*, for malaria with thirst**
Three *liang* each of bupleurum, astragalus, ginseng, and licorice; four *liang* of *guālóu* root; three *liang* of fresh ginger; and twenty jujubes.
Crudely cut the seven ingredients, boil in one *dǒu* and two *shēng* of water to obtain six *shēng*, remove the dregs, and simmer to obtain three *shēng*. Take one *shēng* warm, three times daily.

**Formula: *Mu Li Tang*, for *mǔ*-malaria with predominance of cold** (*mǔ*-malaria, or robust malaria)
Four *liang* each of oyster shell and ephedra; two *liang* of licorice; and three *liang* of *shǔqī* (if unavailable, substitute *hénɡshān*).
First wash the *shǔqī* three times to remove the fishy odor. Crudely cut the ingredients, boil the *shǔqī* and ephedra in eight *shēng* of water to obtain six *shēng*, skim off the foam, add the remaining ingredients, and simmer to obtain two *shēng*. Drink one *shēng* to induce vomiting, then drink again.

**Formula: *Shu Jiao San*, for *mǔ*-malaria with predominance of cold**
Equal parts Sichuan pepper, mica, and dragon bone.
Grind the three ingredients into a fine powder. About the time it takes to cook a meal before the onset, take half a *qián* with vinegar-water. Take one *qián* at the time of onset.

For *wēn-nüè* (warm malaria), add half a *fēn* of *shǔqī*. Fire-bake the mica for three days and three nights. The *Essentials* omits mica and uses *yúnshí* instead.

For *dàn-nüè* (consumptive malaria), where yin qi is isolated and cut off while yang qi alone flourishes, the pulse is faint. Its symptoms include shortness of breath, vexation, fullness, heat in the hands and feet, and retching. It presents only heat without cold, as the pathogenic qi lodges internally in the heart and externally in the interstices of the flesh, causing emaciation and muscle wasting.

For *wēn-nüè* (warm malaria), the pulse is normal, with no cold phase. After six or seven days, only heat appears. Its symptoms include painful, vexing joints, occasional retching, and alternating onsets at dawn and resolution by dusk, or onsets at dusk and resolution by dawn. This is called *wēn-nüè*, and the formula *Bái Hǔ Jiā Guì Tāng* (White Tiger Decoction with Cinnamon) treats it:

One *jīn* of gypsum; six *liǎng* of *zhīmǔ*; two *liǎng* of licorice; six *gě* of non-glutinous rice.
Crudely cut the ingredients, boil the rice in twelve *shēng* of water until tender, strain, add three *liǎng* of *guìxīn* (cinnamon heart), and simmer to obtain three *shēng*. Divide into three doses, cover to induce sweating. Recovery follows if chills, fever, and sweating occur.

*Má Huáng Tāng* (Ephedra Decoction), for malaria requiring sweating:

Four *liǎng* each of ephedra, *guālóu* root, and rhubarb; one *liǎng* of licorice.
Crudely cut the ingredients, boil in seven *shēng* of water to obtain two and a half *shēng*. Divide into three doses: one dose about the time it takes to eat a meal before onset, one at onset, and cover thickly afterward to induce sweating.

For malaria with onsets every other day or at night:

Three *liǎng* each of *héngshān* and bamboo leaves; one hundred grains of *shúmǐ*; eight *liǎng* of gypsum.
Crudely cut the ingredients, soak in eight *shēng* of water in a copper vessel, place under the stars and moon in a high, clean location, and lay a knife across it. The next day, in the patient’s room, simmer the decoction over a gentle fire in the copper vessel to obtain three *shēng*. Divide into three doses: one at dawn, one about the time it takes to eat a meal before onset, and one at onset. After all three doses, rest in a quiet room without speaking. For one day, avoid washing the hands and face, rinsing the mouth, or eating. Once the onset time has passed, bathe, eat, and apply the decoction to the five centers (palms, soles, and chest), face, and head. Place the dregs beside the head. This method has proven divinely effective.

From the *Emergency Remedies*:
Use thirty-four *wūméi* (black plums).

Another formula:
Prepare a thick soup of mutton and wheat noodles, eat to satiety, and drink a little wine as tolerated to induce a pleasant, tipsy state. Enter a secluded room, light charcoal, and cover thickly to induce profuse sweating for recovery.

Another formula:
Burn the hair from a black ox’s tail to ash, and take one *fāngcùnbǐ* with wine, three times daily.

*Héng Shān Wán* (Dichroa Pill), for *nüè* (malaria)—details cannot be fully described:

Eighteen *zhū* each of *héngshān*, *zhīmǔ*, licorice, and rhubarb; one *liǎng* of ephedra.
Grind into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of *wútóng* seeds. Take five pills before meals, twice daily. Gradually increase the dose until recovery. The *Handbook* omits rhubarb.

Another formula for malaria persisting for years, cured in two doses (or one dose if within a month):

Grind three *liǎng* of *héngshān* into powder, mix with egg white, and knead into pills the size of *wútóng* seeds. Place in a copper bowl and steam in boiling water until the fishy odor dissipates. Take twenty pills with bamboo-leaf decoction. Allow vomiting if it occurs. Administer three doses before onset. Eat lightly in the morning but not in the evening; consume a thin rice porridge cooked with bamboo-leaf juice.

*Zhīzǐ Tāng* (Gardenia Decoction), for the same condition:

Fourteen *zhīzǐ* (gardenia); fourteen grains of *shúmǐ*; three *liǎng* of *héngshān*; thirty-four dried *chēqián* leaves (stir-fried).
Crudely cut the ingredients, boil in nine *shēng* of water to obtain three *shēng*. Divide into three doses: one before onset, one at onset, and one after onset. Recovery follows four or five episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. If unchecked, consume cold rice to stop it.

For chronic malaria persisting for a long time:

Three *liǎng* of *héngshān*; one *liǎng* each of cuttlefish bone, *shēngmá*, turtle shell, and aconite.
Crudely cut the ingredients, place in a silk bag, and steep in six *shēng* of wine near a gentle fire, turning occasionally, for one night. Take one *gě* per dose, several doses before onset, which may induce vomiting or diarrhea.

For malaria, regardless of duration:

One and a half *shēng* of urine; three *bǐ* of honey.
Boil three times to a boil and consume in one dose. Take at dawn on the day of onset, fasting until the episode passes. Severe cases gradually improve; recovery occurs within three doses.

Another formula:
A handful each of *shǔwěizǐ* (mouse-tail grass) and *chēqiánzǐ* (plantain seeds).
Crudely cut the ingredients, boil in five *shēng* of water to obtain two *shēng*, and consume before onset.

Another formula:
Five *gě* of *mǎbiān* (verbena) juice and three *gě* of wine, divided into three doses.

Another formula:
Pound *làngdàng* root, burn to ash, and take one *gě* with water, adjusting the dose for the patient’s size and strength.

Another formula:
Thirty-four *guādì* (melon pedicels), pounded and soaked in water overnight, then consumed.

Another formula:
On the seventh day of the seventh month (the *yín* day), gather hemp flowers, grind into powder, and take one *fāngcùnbǐ* with wine.

Another formula:
Burn the soles of old shoes (removing both ends) to ash, and take with well water at dawn.

Another formula:
Consume *qiáoyáo* juice.

Another formula:
Take one *fāngcùnbǐ* of peach blossom powder with water.

Malaria formula:
One *fāngcùn* of turtle shell (stir-fried); two *fāngcùn* of cuttlefish bone; one *liǎng* each of aconite (blast-fried) and licorice; two *liǎng* of *héngshān*.
Crudely cut the ingredients, steep in two and a half *shēng* of wine, expose to the dew for one night, and apply to the five centers, hands, feet, chest, and head the next day. The malaria will cease after the onset time. If not, drink about one *gě* for recovery.

First stir-fry *lí lú* and *zào jiá* until yellow, then grind with the other ingredients into powder. Form honey pills the size of small beans.

Take one pill daily, and one pill at the time of onset. Do not eat to fullness on the day of administration.

*The Zhouhou [Beiji Fang]* omits *héng shān* (dichroa root) and *niú xī* (achyranthes).

**Acupuncture and Moxibustion Methods:**
For liver malaria, bleed the foot *juéyīn* [channel].
For heart malaria, needle the hand *shàoyīn* [channel].
For spleen malaria, needle the foot *tàiyīn* [channel].
For lung malaria, needle the hand *tàiyīn* and *yángmíng* [channels].
For kidney malaria, needle the foot *shàoyīn* and *tàiyáng* [channels].
For stomach malaria, bleed the transverse vessels of the foot *tàiyīn* and *yángmíng* [channels].

In all cases of moxibustion for malaria, first inquire where the illness first manifests, and moxa that location first.
If it begins at the head or neck, preemptively moxa the tip of *dàzhuī* (GV-14) before onset, gradually increasing the moxa; cease once the time has passed.
If it begins at the waist or spine, moxa *shènshū* (BL-23) with one hundred cones.
If it begins in the arms, moxa *sānjiān* (LI-3).

For malaria, moxa *shàngxīng* (GV-23) and *dàzhuī* (GV-14) until one hundred cones are applied at the time of onset. Use moxa cones the size of a millet grain—common people, not understanding how to locate the points, often use excessively large cones.
If one feels even slight discomfort, immediately moxa *bǎihuì* (GV-20) with seven cones. If the malaria recurs later, apply seven more cones. Even the most intractable cases will resolve after no more than three moxibustion sessions.

Stand with the feet on the ground, encircle one foot with a thread, fold it in half, and stretch it from *dàzhuī* (GV-14) to *bǎihuì* (GV-20). Moxa the end of the thread with twenty-one cones, using cones the size of small beans.
Additionally, moxa *fēngchí* (GB-20) with three cones on each side.

For all types of malaria, regardless of duration, have the patient lie supine. Measure the distance between the two nipples with a thread, fold it in half, and from the nipple downward, moxa the end of the thread with a number of cones equal to the patient’s age—left side for men, right for women.

For all malaria affecting the five viscera, moxa *chǐzé* (LU-5) with seven cones. The point is located at the pulsation above the elbow crease.
If the blood vessels are not visible in any malaria, bleed the ten fingertips until blood is drawn; the illness will resolve. First inspect the body for red spots the size of small beans and bleed them all.

For malaria, bleed the foot *shàoyīn* [channel] to cure it.
For *□* malaria, *shàngxīng* (GV-23) governs it. The point is located one *cùn* directly above the midpoint of the hairline on the forehead, in a depression that can accommodate a bean. Moxa with seven cones.
First needle *lùnxǐ* (BL-40), then *tiānyǒu* (SJ-16) and *fēngchí* (GB-20).

For malaria that manifests at dusk, *línqì* (GB-15) governs it. The point is located five *fēn* within the hairline above the outer canthus of the eye. Moxa with seven cones.

If malaria presents with excess and causes lumbar and back pain, or with deficiency and causes nosebleeds, *fēiyáng* (BL-58) governs it. The point is located seven *cùn* above the external malleolus. Moxa with seven cones.

For malaria with profuse sweating, lumbar pain preventing flexion and extension, a sensation of the eyes bulging, and the neck feeling as if pulled, *kūnlún* (BL-60) governs it. The point is located in the depression posterior to the external malleolus on the foot. Moxa with three cones.

**Malaria Exorcism Method:**
Before onset, hold a large rooster close to the body, startling it frequently to make it crow loudly; the illness will resolve immediately.

**Malaria Talismans:**
Use two talismans as follows:

For the first talisman, write:
*"The father of the malaria child is named Shí Bá, the mother is named Shí Chuí. So-and-so (insert patient’s name) suffers from malaria. Secretly recite: ‘All in heaven and earth, mountains, rivers, city gods, sun, moon, and five stars—all revere the Stove Lord. Now there is a malaria ghost-child who curses the Stove Lord as a black-faced slave. If you do not believe it, examine this document.’"*
*Swiftly, as decreed by law.*

This talisman must be written in authentic script, leaving one blank line before and after the text. Place it on the Stove Lord’s forehead, weighing it down with a tile or stone—do not press directly on the characters. Ensure no one touches the talisman. If possible, assign one person to guard it; do not let dust or dirt obscure the characters, which must remain legible.

Follow the talisman application procedure below:
If the malaria manifests after sunrise the next day, have someone sweep the area before the Stove Lord and his forehead clean at night. On the day of onset, have the patient dress neatly, stand before the stove, and read the talisman aloud. If another reads it, the patient must kneel and bow once per recitation, and the reader should grasp the patient’s clothing once. If the patient reads it themselves, they should grasp their own clothing and shake it while stating their name: *"I, so-and-so (insert name), am thus."* Repeat this three times, bowing three times. Then press the talisman under a clean tile or stone, characters facing upward, on the Stove Lord’s forehead—do not press directly on the characters.

If the malaria manifests at dusk, follow the same procedure three times, then repeat three more times at noon.
If it manifests at night, repeat the procedure three times at dusk.

Cooking may continue at the stove, but do not disturb the talisman.
If there are two stoves, place the talisman on the larger one. If there is an outdoor stove, place it on the indoor stove. If only an outdoor stove exists, apply it there according to the method.

The patient must hold the talisman while following the procedure. The talisman’s method is as follows:
If a guest suffers from malaria, wait until they have stayed through three onsets, then apply the talisman as above, substituting the guest’s name. The talisman should read: *"Seize and detain the malaria ghost-child as follows."*

For chronic cases, apply the talisman once to gradually resolve the illness. It may also be applied five times as initially described to fully cure the malaria. The patient must hold the talisman as follows.

**Wang Liang Talisman:**
Written by Zhang Jibo.
*Swiftly, as decreed by law.*

This Wang Liang talisman should be rolled lengthwise. Hold it with both hands while reciting Buddhist invocations and sitting upright. If movement is necessary, tuck it into the front of the garment, characters facing upward.

Use both talismans simultaneously according to their respective methods; do not omit either.
If the malaria does not resolve, even a single lighter onset indicates progress. Apply the talisman again on the next onset day, and the illness will resolve.
Follow the method precisely—any deviation in the characters will prevent a cure.

**Diagnosis of Stream Poisoning (Section Seven):**
In the streams and sources of Jiangdong and Jiangnan, there exists an insect called the *duǎnhú* (short fox) or *xīdú* (stream poison), also known as the *shègōng* (archer). This creature has no eyes but keen ears and can hear. When it dwells in mountain streams and hears human voices, it shoots its venom from its mouth, hence the name *shègōng* (archer).

The insect’s lesser venom or sequential strikes, or when it shoots at a person’s shadow, do not immediately form sores. First, the afflicted suffers chills and fever, an aversion to cold, bodily stiffness, and muscular tension, along with headache, eye pain, yawning, coughing, and disordered breathing. At dawn, there may be slight relief, but by dusk, chills and fever return. The symptoms may resemble *shānghán* (cold damage) with *shífēn* (stone-like hardness) or possession by a corpse, rendering the patient unable to speak. Such are the signs of this malady.

Those unfamiliar with the land or unaccustomed to frequenting mountain streams may mistake it for *shānghán* with *shífēn* and administer inappropriate treatment. When the venom intensifies and sores erupt, it may be misdiagnosed as *biāojū* (deep-rooted abscess). If vomiting fails to expel blood, it may further be suspected as *gǔ* poison, leading to grave consequences. Here, the symptoms are described in detail to distinguish this affliction from *shānghán*.

The remedy is recorded in a separate volume.

**Formulas for the Liver**

**Discourse on the Liver’s Pulse (Chapter One)**

It is said: Man is endowed by Heaven and Earth, and thus internally possesses the five viscera, six bowels, essence and qi, bones and marrow, sinews and vessels; externally, the four limbs, nine orifices, skin and hair, nails and teeth, throat, lips and tongue, anus, and bladder—all of which together form the body. When care and rest are properly regulated, the hundred vessels remain peaceful and harmonious; when exertion is improper, it gives rise to the afflictions of the five taxations, seven injuries, and six extremes. With remedies to apply, though illness arises, there is no grave harm; without methods to rely upon, one may suddenly perish. Therefore, within these volumes, each scroll meticulously describes the origins of the blood and vessels of the five viscera and six bowels, their circulation and flow, and the points where they converge with the nine orifices. It further discusses the relative weight, size, length, breadth, and capacity of the five viscera and six bowels, and enumerates the corresponding treatment methods—pills, powders, wines, decoctions, infusions, plasters, massage, and poultices—as well as moxibustion and acupuncture points, all of which are exhaustively covered herein. Those who devote themselves to the art of medicine may study and apply these principles. By aligning the conditions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess with the nature of the remedies, the hundred diseases, whether internal or external, will have no means of escape.

The five viscera correspond in Heaven to the five stars, on Earth to the five sacred mountains, in time to the five phases, and in man to the five organs. The five organs govern essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent. By discerning yin and yang, examining deficiency and excess, understanding the origins of disease, and applying supplementation and drainage, one harmonizes with the three hundred and sixty-five joints, ultimately connecting with the twelve channels.

It is said: The liver governs the ethereal soul and serves as the official of the court. That which follows the spirit in its coming and going is called the ethereal soul, which is stored in the liver. The eyes are the liver’s officials; the liver qi communicates with the eyes, and when the eyes are harmonious, they can distinguish the five colors. The left eye corresponds to *jiǎ*, the right to *yǐ*; its circulation reaches the Purple Palace, and its flourishing vitality manifests in the nails. Externally, it governs the sinews; internally, it governs the blood. The liver weighs four *jīn* and four *liǎng*, with three lobes on the left and four on the right, totaling seven lobes. Six youths and three jade maidens guard it; its spirit is named *Lánlán*, and it stores the ethereal soul, hence it is called the *hún* viscus, responding to the seasons in due course. Thus, it is said the liver stores blood, and blood harbors the ethereal soul. In qi, it manifests as speech; in fluid, as tears. When the liver qi is deficient, one feels fear; when excessive, one becomes angry.

When the liver qi is deficient, one dreams of gardens and overgrown grass; if the season is favorable, one dreams of crouching beneath a tree, too afraid to rise. When the liver qi is exuberant, one dreams of anger. If counterflow qi invades the liver, one dreams of mountains, forests, and trees.

When a person lies down to sleep, blood returns to the liver. The liver receives blood and thus enables sight; the feet receive blood and thus enable walking; the palms receive blood and thus enable grasping; the fingers receive blood and thus enable seizing.

The liver resembles wood and pairs with the gallbladder as its bowel. Its channel is the Foot *Juéyīn*, which is externally and internally related to the *Shàoyáng*. Its pulse is wiry, it corresponds to winter, and it flourishes in spring. In spring, when the myriad things begin to grow, its qi arrives gently and weakly, broad and vacuous—hence its pulse is wiry. If it is gentle, one must not induce sweating; if it is weak, one must not precipitate. Broadness signifies opening; opening signifies passage; passage signifies free flow—hence it is called broad and vacuous.

The spring pulse is like a zither string—this is the liver pulse, the pulse of the East and of wood, the phase through which the myriad things begin to grow. Thus, its qi arrives gently and weakly, lightly and vacuously, smoothly and straight, extending and long—hence it is called wiry. If it deviates from this, it indicates illness.

What constitutes deviation? If its qi arrives replete and wiry, this is called *tài guò* (excess), and the disease is external. If its qi arrives insubstantial and faint, this is called *bù jí* (insufficiency), and the disease is internal. Excess causes one to be forgetful, prone to anger, and afflicted with sudden dizziness, vertigo, and epilepsy. Insufficiency causes chest pain radiating to the back, with fullness in the flanks and cheeks.

The liver pulse arrives gently and weakly, swaying like the tip of a raised pole—this is normal. (*Cháo Yuán* reads: "gracefully, like pressing the strings of a zither or lute, or like raising a long pole.") In spring, the stomach qi serves as the root. If the liver pulse arrives full, replete, and slippery, like tracing a long pole, this indicates liver disease. If the liver pulse arrives urgent and increasingly tense, like the string of a newly drawn bow, this indicates the death of the liver.

The true liver pulse arrives with internal and external urgency, like tracing a knife’s edge, *zézé* in sound (*Cháo Yuán* reads *zézé*, like pressing the strings of a zither or lute; or like the string of a newly drawn bow). If the complexion is greenish-white and lusterless, and the body hair is brittle, death ensues.

In spring, a faintly wiry stomach qi is normal. If the wiry quality is excessive and the stomach qi scant, this indicates liver disease. If it is purely wiry without stomach qi, this indicates death. If there is stomach qi with a hair-like quality, the illness will arise in autumn; if the hair-like quality is pronounced, the illness is imminent.

The liver stores blood, and blood harbors the ethereal soul. Grief and sorrow stirring within injure the ethereal soul; when the ethereal soul is injured, one becomes deranged and reckless, unable to guard one’s essence (or: deranged and lacking essence, unable to face others directly). This causes contraction of the genitals and spasms of the sinews, inability to raise the ribs in the flanks, withered body hair and a pallid complexion—death occurs in autumn.

When the qi of the Foot *Juéyīn* is cut off, the sinews contract, drawing the testicles and tongue. The *Juéyīn* is the liver channel; the liver is the convergence of the sinews. The sinews gather at the genitals and connect to the root of the tongue. Thus, if the vessels fail to nourish them, the sinews contract and spasm, pulling the testicles and tongue. Hence, when the lips turn green, the tongue curls, and the testicles retract, the sinews are the first to die. Death occurs on a *gēng* day (severe) or a *xīn* day (final)—metal overcoming wood.

When the liver is a dead viscus, its pulse is weak on the surface; upon pressing, it feels like a rope that does not return, or twists like a snake in motion—this indicates death.

In spring, when the liver-wood flourishes, its pulse is wiry, fine, and long—this is normal. If instead it is deep, soft, and slippery, this is the kidney overacting on the liver, the mother returning to the child, constituting a vacuity evil; though ill, it is easily treated. If it is floating, large, and surging, this is the heart overacting on the liver, the child overwhelming the mother, constituting a repletion evil; though ill, it will self-resolve. If it is faint, rough, and short (*Qiānjīn Yì* reads: faint, floating, and short with roughness), this is the lung overacting on the liver, metal restraining wood, constituting a perverse evil—this is greatly contrary, and ten out of ten cases will not survive.

If instead it is large and moderate, this is the spleen overacting on the liver, earth encroaching upon wood, constituting a minor evil; though ill, it will soon recover.

When the heart overacts on the liver, there must be vomiting and diarrhea; when the lung overacts on the liver, there will be abscesses and swellings.

If the yin pulse at the left guan position is absent, this indicates no liver pulse. The patient will suffer from urinary block, incontinence, difficulty speaking, pathogenic qi in the rib-sides, and frequent vomiting. Treat by needling the foot shaoyang to regulate yang.

If the yin pulse at the left guan position is replete, this indicates liver repletion. The patient will suffer from pain within the flesh, frequent convulsions, and vomiting. Treat by needling the foot jueyin to regulate yin.

When the liver pulse arrives, glistening like a pole leaning or like the strings of a zither or lute, two beats per breath is normal; three beats is departure from the norm and illness; four beats is loss of essence; five beats is death; six beats is the end of life—this is the foot jueyin pulse.

If the liver pulse is extremely rapid, there will be malign speech (one version reads: delirious speech); if slightly rapid, there will be *fei qi* beneath the rib-side, like an inverted cup. If extremely moderate, there will be vomiting; if slightly moderate, there will be water conglomeration and impediment. If extremely large, there will be internal abscesses, frequent vomiting of blood, and nosebleed; if slightly large, there will be liver impediment with contraction, coughing drawing pain into the lower abdomen. If extremely small, there will be excessive drinking; if slightly small, there will be wasting-thirst. If extremely slippery, there will be sagging hernia; if slightly slippery, there will be incontinence. If extremely rough, there will be bland rheum; if slightly rough, there will be convulsions and spasms with sinew contraction.

If the liver pulse is forceful, firm, and long, yet the complexion is not greenish, the patient will suffer from falls. If it is forceful due to blood stagnation beneath the rib-side, this will cause panting and counterflow. If it is soft and scattered, with a lustrous complexion, the patient will suffer from overflowing rheum. Overflowing rheum is when one is suddenly thirsty and drinks excessively, causing the fluids to overflow outside the flesh, skin, and intestines (*Suwen* reads *yi ru* as *yi ru*). When the greenish pulse arrives, long and flicking left and right, there is accumulative qi beneath the heart, propping the rib-side—this is called liver impediment. It arises from cold-damp and shares the same treatment principle as hernia: lumbar pain, cold feet, and headache.

Bian Que said: When the liver is diseased, the eyes are deprived; when essence is vacuous, there is cold; when cold prevails, yin qi flourishes, and when yin qi flourishes, one dreams of mountains and trees. When replete, there is heat; when heat prevails, yang qi flourishes, and when yang qi flourishes, one dreams of anger.

The liver governs sound as calling, its pathological movement is grasping, and its emotion is anger. When anger injures the liver, if essence and qi converge in the liver, there will be sorrow. When the liver is vacuous, there is fear; when replete, there is anger. If anger persists unceasingly, it will also generate sorrow.

The liver corresponds to spring in color. For diseases manifesting in complexion, treat at the ying-spring points.

When disease first arises in the liver, there is dizziness, rib-side pain, and propping fullness. After one day, it moves to the spleen, causing blockage and obstruction, with generalized pain and heavy body. After two days, it moves to the stomach, causing abdominal distention. After three days, it moves to the kidneys, causing lower abdominal, lumbar, and spinal pain, and aching sinews.

If the disease persists for ten days without resolution, death will follow. In winter, it occurs at sunset; in summer, at early breakfast.

When disease resides in the liver, clarity comes at dawn, exacerbation in the late afternoon, and stillness at midnight.

If liver disease arises from traveling west or consuming chicken meat, the illness will manifest in autumn, specifically on geng or xin days. If a household has a violent death involving bloodshed, and a woman witnesses it, disaster will strike at dawn unless she is affected by gold or silver objects.

The manifestations of liver disease invariably include pain beneath both rib-sides radiating to the lower abdomen, causing the person to be prone to anger. In vacuity, the eyes become blurred and unable to see, the ears unable to hear, and the person is prone to fear, as if someone were about to seize them.

To treat it, one should select the channels: the Foot Jueyin and Shaoyang. If qi counterflows, there will be headache, dizziness, deafness, and swollen cheeks; bloodletting is required.

When the liver pulse is deep and urgent, or floating and similarly so, there is rib-side pain with qi, propping fullness radiating to lower abdominal pain, occasional difficulty in urination, dizziness, headache, lumbar and spinal pain, cold feet, and periodic urinary blockage. In women, menstruation ceases or becomes irregular, caused by falls or injuries in youth.

Liver disease presents with a greenish complexion, spasms in the hands and feet, fullness beneath the rib-sides, and occasional dizziness or fainting. Its pulse is wiry and long—this is treatable. It is appropriate to administer *Fangfeng Zhuli Tang* (Ledebouriella and Bamboo Sap Decoction) and *Qinjiao San* (Gentiana Macrophylla Powder).

In spring, needle *Dadun* (LV 1); in summer, *Xingjian* (LV 2); in winter, *Ququan* (LV 8)—all with supplementation. In late summer, needle *Taichong* (LV 3); in autumn, *Zhongdu* (LV 6)—all with drainage.

Additionally, one should moxibust *Qimen* (LV 14) with one hundred cones and the ninth thoracic vertebra on the back with fifty cones.

When pathogenic qi resides in the Liver, there is pain in both rib-sides, internal cold, and stagnant blood within. The shins often spasm, and the joints periodically swell. Treat by needling *Xingjian* (LV 2) to draw out the pathogen from beneath the rib-sides, supplementing *Zusanli* (ST 36) to warm the Stomach, bleeding the vessels to disperse stagnant blood, and pricking the greenish vessels between the ears to relieve spasms.

Whenever one suffers a fall or injury, stagnant blood remains within. If one experiences great anger, qi ascends and cannot descend, accumulating beneath the left rib-side, thus injuring the Liver.

When the Liver is assailed by wind, the head and eyes twitch, both rib-sides ache, and the patient often walks hunched over. They crave sweet flavors and appear as if obstructed, like a pregnant woman.

When the Liver is afflicted by cold, the patient shivers with aversion to cold, feverish heat arises, the face flushes red, and slight sweating occurs. There is vexing heat in the chest.

When the Liver is struck by cold, the patient cannot raise both arms, the root of the tongue swells, causing a large, dry tongue. They frequently sigh, experience chest pain, cannot turn to the side, occasionally suffer night sweats, cough, and after eating, vomit their food.

The Liver governs the chest; when diseased, there is panting, anger, and cursing. Its pulse is deep, the chest feels obstructed, and the patient desires to be pushed or pressed. There is heat and nasal congestion.

When the Liver is injured, the patient’s flesh wastes away. They lie with their mouth agape, their hands and feet occasionally turn blue, their eyes close, and their pupils ache—all due to injury of the Liver organ.

When the Liver is afflicted by water, the patient’s abdomen is distended, they cannot turn to the side, and there is pain beneath the rib-sides and in the abdomen. Occasionally, slight fluids are generated, and urination resumes intermittently.

When the Liver is distended, there is fullness beneath the rib-sides, and pain radiates to the lower abdomen, causing restlessness.

In *gan zhuo* (Liver stagnation), the patient constantly desires to tread upon their chest. Before the suffering begins, they only crave hot drinks.

When examining Liver accumulations, the pulse is wiry and fine, with pain beneath both rib-sides. Pathogenic qi travels to the region below the heart, the foot meridians become cold, and pain from the rib-sides radiates to the lower abdomen. In men, there is *ji shan* (hernial accumulation); in women, *jia lin* (abdominal masses and strangury). The body lacks luster, tendons frequently spasm, and the nails become withered, scorched, greenish-black. The condition improves in spring but worsens in autumn, and the complexion is green.

The Liver’s accumulation is called *fei qi* (fat qi), located beneath the left rib-side, resembling an overturned cup with a head and feet, like the shape of a turtle or soft-shelled turtle. If it persists without cure, it gives rise to coughing with counterflow qi and *nüe* (malaria), lasting for years without end.

Why is it contracted on *ji xia* (late summer) *wu ji* days? When the Lung is diseased, it transmits to the Liver; the Liver should transmit to the Spleen, but the Spleen is in its ruling phase during late summer. The ruler does not receive pathogenic qi, so the Liver attempts to return it to the Lung, but the Lung refuses to accept it. Thus, it remains and congeals into an accumulation, which is why *fei qi* is contracted in late summer.

When the Liver is diseased, there is fullness in the chest and distension in the rib-sides, frequent anger, shouting, and crying. The body feels hot yet also averse to cold, the limbs cannot be lifted, the face is pale, and the body is smooth. The pulse should be wiry, long, and rapid, but if it is instead short and rough, and the complexion should be green but is instead white, this is metal overwhelming wood—a great counterflow. It is incurable, and the patient will not survive ten days.

Duke Xiang asked Bian Que: “I wish to diagnose without taking the pulse, to observe the voice and examine the complexion to know whether the disease will result in life or death. May I hear of this?”

Bian Que replied: “This is the great essential of the sagely Dao, not transmitted by masters, valued by the Yellow Emperor more than gold or jade. Upon entering the door and seeing the patient, observing their complexion and hearing their breath, one knows the auspicious or inauspicious signs of their qi’s coming and going.”

The *jiao* tone corresponds to the Liver’s sound. The Liver’s sound is a cry, its tone like the *qin*, its emotion anger, and its meridian the Foot *Jueyin*.

When *jue ni* (counterflow of *Shaoyang*) occurs, the *ying* and *wei* (nutritive and defensive qi) do not flow, yin and yang intermingle, yin qi is externally injured, and yang qi strikes internally. When it strikes, there is cold; when cold prevails, there is deficiency; when deficient, the patient suddenly becomes mute and voiceless. This is *li feng* (severe wind) entering the Liver, and *Xu Ming Tang* (Decoction for Continuing Life) governs it. The formula is found in another volume.

If the patient can only squat and cannot lower their head, their face and eyes turn green and develop a blackish hue, their limbs become weak and slack, and they experience incontinence of stool and urine—if severe, it is incurable; if mild, within ten days or a month, *Gui Zhi Tang* (Cinnamon Twig Decoction) governs it. The formula is found in another volume.

If the patient cries out and weeps, and their weeping turns to moaning, this is metal overwhelming wood, yin striking yang. Yin qi rises while yang qi lies hidden; when hidden, it becomes replete; when replete, there is heat; when hot, there is panting; when panting, there is counterflow; when counterflow, there is oppression; when oppressed, there is fear. The eyes cannot see clearly, the voice is urgent and sharp, and they speak incoherently as if someone were present—this is pathogenic heat injuring the Liver. If severe, it is incurable. If the lips are green but the eyes still respond, it is treatable, and *Di Huang Jian* (Rehmannia Decoction) governs it. The formula is found in the section on Liver deficiency and excess.

When the Liver causes *nüe* (malaria), the patient’s complexion is ashen, they frequently sigh, and their appearance seems as if dead. *Wu Mei Wan* (Mume Pill) governs it. The formula is found in another volume.

If a person is originally not prone to sorrow or anger but suddenly becomes irascible, speaks abnormally, alternates between leniency and urgency, and before finishing their words, raises their hand to their eyes as if afraid, if they do not fall ill immediately, disaster will surely come—this is the sign of the Liver’s voice in disease.

If the person is deficient, they are injured by cold wind; if replete, they are harmed by heat qi. When yang is replete, drain it; when yin is deficient, supplement it.

Green corresponds to the Liver, and the Liver governs the sinews. Green like kingfisher feathers is auspicious.

The Liver governs the eyes, and the eyes are the Liver’s surplus. The person of Wood constitution resembles the upper *jiao* (angle): greenish complexion, small head and long face, broad shoulders and flat back, upright body, small hands and feet, talented, fond of mental exertion, lacking physical strength, often worried and labored by affairs. They endure spring and summer but not autumn and winter; in autumn and winter, they are susceptible to illness. The Foot *Jueyin* is *ta ta ran* (relaxed and broad), the rib-sides are wide, and if firm or brittle, upright or slanted, the Liver responds accordingly.

If the green complexion is pure and the texture fine, the Liver is small; if small, the organ is peaceful, and there is no disease beneath the rib-sides. If the texture is coarse, the Liver is large; if large, it is deficient; if deficient, there is cold, pressing upon the Stomach and constricting the throat, often causing diaphragm obstruction and pain beneath the rib-sides at dawn.

If the rib-sides are broad and turned outward, the Liver is high; if high, it is replete; if replete, the Liver is hot, pressing upward and causing tension beneath the rib-sides, resulting in *xi ben* (rapid panting). If the rib-sides are closed and turned inward like a rabbit’s bite, the Liver is low; if low, it presses upon the Stomach, leaving the space beneath the rib-sides empty, and emptiness makes one susceptible to pathogenic qi.

If the rib bones are firm, the Liver is firm; if firm, the organ is peaceful and difficult to injure. If the rib bones are weak, the Liver is brittle; if brittle, one is prone to *xiao dan* (wasting-thirst) and easily injured. If the rib-sides and abdomen are well-proportioned, the Liver is upright; if upright, it is harmonious, beneficial, and difficult to injure. If the rib bones are unevenly raised, the Liver is slanted; if slanted, there is pain beneath one side of the rib-sides.

In all people, wherever the bodily regions show depressions or protrusions, illness will arise. The Gallbladder *Shaoyang* is the Liver’s corresponding region, and the organ’s qi communicates between interior and exterior, so the region responds accordingly. Depth and turbidity pertain to the interior; superficiality and clarity pertain to the exterior. If the complexion moves from outside inward, the illness arises externally, and the region shows protrusion; if the complexion moves from inside outward, the illness arises internally, and the region shows depression.

For internal illnesses, first treat the *yin*, then the *yang*; for external illnesses, first treat the *yang*, then the *yin*. *Yang* governs the exterior; *yin* governs the interior. In all people, life and death, fortune and misfortune are foretold by the organ spirits, which first manifest changes in external form.

When the Liver is about to fall ill, the eyes lose their luster. If the Liver is about to die, the eyes lose their essence. If the color of the celestial center and its divisions corresponds to the *mu* (grave) color, the condition is fatal and incurable. Observe the correspondences, adjusting for extensions or contractions: if extended, death will not occur within four hundred days; if contracted, it will not be delayed beyond ten days or a month.

How can one know if a Liver illness, though slightly improved, will suddenly prove fatal? It is said: if a bluish-white mark the size of a thumb appears on the cheek, death will come suddenly. How can one know if the Liver is exhausted and death will occur in eight days? The face turns green, the eyes red, and the patient only desires to lie down, seeing nothing even when looking; sweat flows like water without ceasing, and death comes within one or two days. If the face is black and the eyes green, the patient will not die; if the green resembles withered grass, death is certain.

Fortune and misfortune are revealed in the bodily divisions: if the colors appear in proper sequence, a bluish-white entering the eyes signals illness within the year. If the year’s region shows no correspondence, disaster will strike within three years.

In spring, the Wood phase governs the Liver’s pulse, which is green and corresponds to the Foot *Shaoyang* channel. In spring, one selects the network vessels and the spaces between the flesh. Spring is when Wood begins its governance, and the Liver’s qi begins to generate. The Liver’s qi is urgent, its wind swift; its channels are usually deep, but its qi is scant and cannot penetrate deeply, so one selects the network vessels between the flesh. The root of its channel lies between *Qiao Yin*, corresponding to the region before the *Chuang Long* (window lattice). The *Chuang Long* refers to the pulse above and below the ear, which moves when pressed.

Its sinews begin above the second toe, bind at the outer ankle, ascend along the outer edge of the shin, and bind at the outer knee. One branch arises from the outer auxiliary bone, ascends to the thigh, with the anterior branch binding above the *Fu Tu* (crouching rabbit) and the posterior branch binding at the sacrum. The straight branch ascends to the *Miao* (slightly raised area), supports the *Ji Xie* (seasonal rib-sides), ascends along the anterior edge of the armpit, flanks the chest and breasts, and binds at the *Que Pen* (supraclavicular fossa). The straight branch emerges from the armpit, penetrates the *Que Pen*, exits before the *Taiyang*, follows behind the ear, ascends to the forehead, converges at the vertex, descends to the jaw, and binds at the nose. One branch binds at the outer canthus, forming the outer *wei* (mainstay).

Its channel begins at the outer canthus, ascends to the corner of the forehead, descends behind the ear, follows the neck, runs before the Hand *Shaoyang*, reaches the shoulder, crosses behind the Hand *Shaoyang*, and enters the *Que Pen*. One branch enters the ear from behind, exits before the ear, and reaches the posterior side of the outer canthus. Another branch separates at the outer canthus, descends to *Da Ying*, converges with the Hand *Shaoyang* at the [missing character], descends to the cheekbone, follows the neck, converges at the *Que Pen*, descends into the chest, penetrates the diaphragm, connects with the Liver, pertains to the Gallbladder, follows the rib-sides, exits at the *Qi Jie* (Qi Street), encircles the pubic hairline, and enters horizontally into the *Bi Yan* (thigh joint).

The straight branch descends from the *Que Pen* through the armpit, follows the chest, passes the *Ji Xie*, converges at the *Bi Yan*, descends along the outer thigh, exits before the outer auxiliary bone, straightens to reach the end of the *Jue Gu* (severed bone), exits before the outer ankle, follows the instep, and emerges at the tip of the second toe. One branch separates at the instep, enters between the big toe, follows the inner fork of the big toe to its tip, turns back to penetrate the nail, emerges at the *san mao* (three hairs), and converges with the Foot *Jueyin* as its exterior-interior pair.

The root of the *Jueyin* lies five *cun* above *Xing Jian*, corresponding to the back *shu* points, and converges with the Hand *Taiyin*. The Foot *Shaoyang*’s branch is called *Guang Ming*, located half a *cun* from the ankle. It diverges to the *Jueyin* and descends to connect with the instep.

When the Liver generates illness, if replete, the Gallbladder is hot; if hot, there is *jue* (reversal); if *jue*, the *yang* is diseased, and the *yang* pulse is abnormally twice as large as the *cun kou* pulse. The illness manifests as heat in the chest, pain in the heart, rib-sides, head, and jaw, and swelling beneath the *Que Pen* and armpit. If deficient, the Gallbladder is cold; if cold, there is atrophy and paralysis; if paralyzed, the *yin* is diseased, and the *yin* pulse is abnormally smaller than the *cun kou* pulse. The illness manifests as cold in the chest, shortness of breath, bitter taste in the mouth, lack of luster in the body, and pain extending to the shin, *Jue Gu*, anterior to the outer ankle, and all joints.

If both *yin* and *yang* are calm or both are agitated, moving like a taut rope being tugged, it signals illness. All these are diseases of the Foot *Shaoyang* Gallbladder channel’s sinews, branches, and divergences. Now, the Foot *Jueyin* Liver channel is appended below.

The Foot *Jueyin* channel begins at the edge of the big toe’s *ju mao* (gathered hairs), ascends along the upper edge of the instep, passes one *cun* from the inner ankle, ascends eight *cun* above the ankle, crosses behind the *Taiyin*, ascends along the inner knee, follows the inner thigh, enters the pubic hair, encircles the genitals, reaches the lower abdomen, flanks the Stomach, pertains to the Liver, connects with the Gallbladder, ascends to penetrate the diaphragm, spreads through the rib-sides, follows behind the throat, enters the *Yan Sang* (nasopharynx), connects with the eye system, ascends to emerge at the forehead, and converges with the *Du Mai* at the vertex.

One version states: Its branch departs from the lower abdomen and, together with the *Taiyin* and *Shaoyang*, binds beneath the lumbar vertebrae in the third and fourth vertebral interstices. Another branch descends from the eye system, encircles the inner cheek, and winds around the lips. Yet another branch diverges from the Liver, penetrates the diaphragm, and ascends to pour into the Lungs.

When this channel is stirred, the diseases are lumbar pain with inability to bend forward or backward; in men, *tuíshàn* (inguinal hernia); in women, swelling of the lower abdomen. In severe cases, dry throat and a dusty, withered complexion appear. The diseases governed by the Liver include chest fullness, retching with counterflow, *dòngxiè* (watery diarrhea), *húshàn* (inguinal hernia), enuresis, and urinary blockage. When in excess, the *cunkou* pulse is twice as large as the *renying*; when deficient, the *cunkou* is smaller than the *renying*.

The Foot *Jueyin*’s divergence is called *Lígōu* (Woodworm Ditch), located five *cun* above the inner ankle, where it diverges to join the *Shaoyang*. Its branch ascends along the channel to the testicles, binding at the penis. When its qi rebels, sudden swelling of the testicles and acute hernia occur. In repletion, the penis remains erect and hot; in depletion, sudden itching arises. Treat at the site of divergence.

The Foot *Jueyin*’s sinews begin above the big toe, ascend to bind anterior to the inner ankle, follow the shin to bind above the inner knee, descend along the inner thigh, and bind at the genitals, knotting and networking all sinews. During the three months of spring, it governs the Liver and Gallbladder’s *qīng jīn qiān bìng* (green sinew traction disease). Its origin lies in the *Shaoyin*, extending into the Foot *Shaoyang*. As *Shaoyang* qi begins to arise and *Shaoyin* qi begins to wane, yin and yang become pent-up in the interstices, giving rise to diseases of the skin and hair. Illnesses of the exterior and interior thus emerge. When *Shaoyang* stirs and counterflows against *Shaoyin* qi, the viscera and bowels are afflicted by pestilence. The diseases manifest oppositely: if the bowel is depleted, it is harmed by yin evil, causing lumbar and back stiffness, leg contraction with inability to extend, and a sensation of the waist being about to snap. Flowers appear in the eyes. If the viscus is replete, it is damaged by yang toxin, causing chills followed by heat, with the outer pair of neck sinews pulled taut and unable to flex or extend. The neck stiffens, the back arches, and the eyes turn red and yellow. When attempting to turn, the entire body must rotate, hence it is called *qīng jīn qiān bìng* (green sinew traction disease). For prescriptions, see the *Cold Damage* scroll.

**Moxibustion Method:**
Bian Que said: Moxibustion at the Liver and Lung transport points governs the treatment of *dāndú qiān bìng* (cinnabar toxin traction disease). By regulating yang according to its source and ordering yin, diseases of the viscera and bowels will not arise.

**Liver Organ Remedies: Treatise on the Fourth of the Six Exhaustions—Sinew Exhaustion**

**Formulae, Moxibustion Methods, and Discourse**

The discourse states: The Six Exhaustions arise thus—Heaven’s *qi* communicates with the lungs, Earth’s *qi* with the throat, wind’s *qi* responds to the liver, thunder’s *qi* stirs the heart, grain’s *qi* affects the spleen (*Suwen* reads "grain" as "valley"), and rain’s *qi* moistens the kidneys. The Six Meridians serve as rivers, the intestines and stomach as the sea, and the nine orifices as the conduits of water’s *qi*. Thus, the orifices correspond to the Five Viscera. When the Five Viscera are afflicted by evil, the Six Bowels develop exhaustion, hence the term "Five Viscera and Six Exhaustions."

The discourse states: Sinew exhaustion pertains to the liver. The liver governs the sinews, and the sinews unite with the liver. When the liver is diseased, illness arises from the sinews. It is further said: If one encounters illness in spring, it becomes sinew impediment (*jin bi*). If sinew impediment persists and is again assailed by evil, it lodges internally in the liver, causing *yang qi* to enter within and *yin qi* to emerge without. Should *yin qi* exit externally, this efflux induces deficiency; deficiency leads to sinew vacuity, and sinew vacuity results in frequent sorrow, with a greenish-pale complexion appearing beneath the eyes. If cold damage occurs, the sinews become immobile, all ten fingernails ache, and one frequently suffers from cramping sinews. Its origin lies in contracting wind damage on *jia-yi* days of spring—wind residing in the sinews constitutes liver vacuity wind. If *yang qi* erupts internally, this eruption engenders repletion; repletion causes sinew repletion, and sinew repletion leads to frequent anger and dry throat. Heat damage induces coughing, and coughing causes pain beneath the ribs, rendering one unable to turn. Additionally, the soles of the feet become swollen and painful—this is termed liver repletion wind.

Thus, one should lift what is light, reduce what is heavy, and amplify what is weak. Discern *yin* and *yang* to distinguish softness and hardness. Treat *yang* diseases through *yin*, and *yin* diseases through *yang*. A skilled physician treats illness when it resides in the skin, flesh, sinews, or vessels; next, the Six Bowels are addressed. If it reaches the Five Viscera, recovery is half-forfeit.

Bian Que stated: When the sinews are severed, the condition is incurable, and death follows in nine days. How is this known? The hands and feet, nails, and skin turn greenish-black, and the patient curses incessantly without pause. The sinews correspond to the Foot *Jueyin*; when the *qi* of Foot *Jueyin* is severed, the sinews contract, drawing the testicles and tongue—thus, the sinews die first.

**Fifth Discussion on Hardenings, Accumulations, and Gatherings**

*Formulas and Moxibustion Methods*

Question: Diseases include accumulations and gatherings—how are they distinguished?
Answer: Accumulations pertain to yin qi; gatherings pertain to yang qi. Thus, yin is deep and hidden, while yang is superficial and mobile. Where qi accumulates is called an *accumulation*; where qi gathers is called a *gathering*. Therefore, accumulations arise from the five viscera, while gatherings form in the six bowels. Accumulations are yin qi; their onset has a fixed location, and their pain (or disease) does not depart from their region, with defined upper and lower boundaries and lateral limits. Gatherings are yang qi; their onset lacks a root, they move without fixed location, and their pain has no constant site—hence they are called *gatherings*. This is how accumulations and gatherings are distinguished.

When the channels and network vessels contract disease and it enters the intestines and stomach, the five viscera’s accumulations manifest as *Fuliang* (Hidden Beam), *Xiben* (Panting Rash), *Feiqi* (Fat Qi), *Piqi* (Obstructive Qi), and *Bentun* (Running Piglet).

Question: How do accumulations begin and progress to their full formation?
Answer: Accumulations begin when cold is encountered and form when counterflow ceases.

Question: Why are some people prone to intestinal accumulations?
Answer: Those with thin, lusterless skin and soft, moist flesh have damaged intestines and stomach, making them vulnerable to evil qi lingering and forming accumulations. Irregular cold and warmth allow evil qi to lodge, and over time, their retention and stagnation give rise to major gatherings and disease.

Question: What is the disease when the body, waist, hips, thighs, and shanks are all swollen, with pain encircling the navel?
Answer: This is called *Fuliang* (Hidden Beam). It is a wind root and must not be disturbed; stirring it leads to water disease with inhibited urination.

When the lower abdomen is full and has roots extending in all directions, it is *Fuliang*. It encloses pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach and cannot be treated. Attempting treatment with pressure often proves fatal. Below, it affects the yin, necessitating discharge of pus and blood; above, it presses on the stomach duct, producing Wang Bing’s note: "should read *emerging through the diaphragm*," forming an abscess alongside the stomach duct within. This is a chronic condition and difficult to cure. If located above the navel, it is contrary [to treatment]; avoid disturbance, as it rapidly depletes qi, overflowing into the large intestine and binding at the *Gao* (Membrane Source). The origin of *Gao* lies below the navel, hence the pain encircles it.

*Santai Pill* governs the five viscera’s cold and heat accumulations, drum distention, borborygmus with belching, and failure of food to nourish flesh and skin. In severe cases, it causes counterflow retching. If taken after recovery from cold damage or cold malaria, it prevents recurrence. Take five pills after meals; for those who drink heavily, take ten pills. Regular use harmonizes urination and defecation and promotes flesh growth.
*Ingredients:*
2 *liang* each of stir-fried rhubarb and *peucedanum*
1 *sheng* each of *nitrum*, *tingli*, and apricot kernel
1 *liang* each of *magnolia bark*, *aconite*, *asarum*, and *pinellia*

The *Niter Great Pill* (消石大圓) treats the twelve types of *zheng* and *jia* accumulations, as well as women’s *dai* disorders and infertility. It is also for those who wish to take *Cold Food Powder* (寒食散) but have hard accumulations in the abdomen. First administer this great pill to purge the accumulations, then give the *Cold Food Powder*. The great pill does not purge water or grain but only the illness, without weakening the patient:

*Niter* 6 *liang* (or *mirabilite*)
*Rhubarb* 8 *liang*
*Ginseng* 2 *liang*
*Licorice* 2 *liang*

Grind the four ingredients into powder. Place three *sheng* of three-year-old bitter wine in a copper vessel, using a bamboo chopstick to mark three divisions (one *sheng* per mark). Heat over a fire, first adding the *rhubarb* and stirring constantly to maintain a gentle boil for one mark’s duration. Then add the remaining ingredients, boiling for another mark’s duration, and finally simmering on low heat for the last mark until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk.

When compounding these medicines, one must first observe a fast for one night, ensuring that children, women, servants, or slaves do not witness the process. For those requiring purgation of illness, administer two of the large pills. If the patient cannot take the large pills, they may be divided into smaller ones, though no more than four should be given. The pills should be large rather than dense, and it is best if they need not be divided. For those who are frail, administer a smaller dose; for the robust, five doses may be given over twenty days. After taking the medicine, allow half a day for harmonization before the purgation begins. If a woman takes this and purges, the discharge may resemble chicken liver or rice-water, sometimes bright red or black, ranging from one *sheng* to three *sheng*. After purgation, she must avoid wind and cold, consume a cup of congee, then prepare a thick soup to nourish herself as one would a postpartum woman. Within six months, she may conceive. She should abstain from raw fish, pork, and pungent vegetables. Those taking the *Cold Food Powder* should follow its own regimen and not take it on the same day as this medicine.

The formula is as follows:

*Earth melon root* and *platycodon* (each ground into half a *sheng* of powder)
*Apricot kernels* (1 *sheng*)
*Rhubarb* (1 *jin*, steamed beneath two *dou* of rice, then sun-dried)

Grind the four ingredients into powder and form into honey pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take three pills on an empty stomach with water, three times daily. Increase the dose gradually until the desired effect is achieved.

**Formula for Undigested Food:**
Burn the same type of food that was not digested into ash, then take a square-inch spoonful with wine. This will induce vomiting of the retained food, and the condition will resolve. For those who fall ill from undigested peaches, if fresh peaches are unavailable, burn dried peaches found on the tree and take them; this will promptly induce vomiting of the illness. It is highly effective.

**Formula for Sudden Indigestion Leading to Masses:**
Simmer mugwort juice into a syrup. Take half a *sheng* in one dose to induce vomiting of the retained food. This method is divinely efficacious. According to the *Ancient and Modern Proven Formulas*, boil a bundle of white mugwort (five *chi* in circumference) with a large handful of *coix* roots.

**Formula for Hard Masses in the Lower Abdomen, the Size of a Plate, with Fullness in the Chest, Indigestion, and Emaciation in Women:**
Take a square-inch spoonful of human hair ash with warm water, twice daily, and apply moxibustion to the ends of the ribs. Alternatively, take a square-inch spoonful of high-quality yeast powder three times daily. Another method is to apply moxibustion to the *Sanjiao* points according to the patient’s age. This will bring relief.

**Formula for *Fu Liang* Qi:**
Collect white horse urine in a copper vessel and take one *sheng* each morning.

**Formula for Masses and Concretions:**
Simmer the white bark of an oak tree until it can be formed into pills. Take them until the illness is stirred; if purgation occurs, reduce the dose.

**Moxibustion with Pepper Formula for Masses, Concretions, and *Gua* Diseases Resembling Melons, the Sun, or the Moon, Located to the Left or Right of the Navel, Above or Below It, or Like a Turtle Beneath the Ribs or at the Heart, the Size of a Small Box:**
First, apply acupuncture to the feet, then proceed with the pepper moxibustion. Take a new basin holding one *dou*, drill 120 holes in its base, and place three *ge* of pepper in the holes. Cover with a layer of paper, then add one *sheng* of cold ash, followed by half a *sheng* of hot ash, and finally one *jin* of hard charcoal. After the time it takes to eat a meal, the basin’s base will become thoroughly hot. Apply it over the affected area, first placing a layer of felt, then the fire basin. As the basin grows hotter, gradually add another layer of felt. If the heat becomes unbearable, add up to three layers, then pause briefly to sip cold water before resuming. When about two-thirds of the mass has dissipated, cease the treatment. Avoid exposure for three days, and by the seventh day, a complete cure should be achieved. Then consume nourishing foods to restore strength. If the condition does not fully resolve, take the *Lu Su Pill* (formula found in another volume).

**Formula for Abdominal Masses:**
Steep one *sheng* of roasted *tingli* seeds in five *sheng* of wine for seven days. Take three *ge* three times daily.

**Formula for Snake Masses:**
Cut white horse tail into pieces five *fen* long. Take a square-inch spoonful with wine. Large masses will be expelled. Take another two-thirds of a square-inch spoonful to expel medium masses, and another one-third to expel small masses. Do not take the full dose at once, as it may be fatal. (Note: Some texts use horse hair instead of tail.)

**Rhubarb Decoction for Snake Masses:**
*Rhubarb* and *poria* (half a *liang* each; some texts use *scutellaria* instead of *poria*)
*Cuttlefish bone* (2 pieces)
*Gleditsia* (6 pieces, of the pig-tooth variety)
*Licorice* (a one-*chi*-long piece, the thickness of a finger)
*Mirabilite* (1 piece, the size of a chicken’s egg)

Combine the six ingredients, chop coarsely, and decoct in six *sheng* of water for three to five boilings. Strain, add *mirabilite*, and consume the entire decoction at an appropriate temperature. Prepare one dose every ten days following the above method. Fast the night before, and take on an empty stomach at dawn; the root of the disease will be purged.

**Formula for Turtle Masses:**
For turtle masses causing abdominal hardness, swelling as large as a basin, and difficulty lying down—when the disease is contracted through food, it lodges below the heart, becoming firm and unyielding.
Take one *jin* of indigo, pound, and extract three *sheng* of juice with water. Take one *sheng* twice daily.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take a handful of *suo-di* root bark, grind to extract juice, mix with water, and consume in one dose.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take one *sheng* of white horse urine and the whites of three chicken eggs, combine, and simmer to reduce to two *ge*. Consume in one dose on an empty stomach; the disease will be vomited out shortly after.

**Alternative Formula:**
Take one *sheng* of chicken droppings, stir-fry until yellow, and take five *ge*. Steep in one *sheng* of wine, strain half, and pound the residue into powder. Take one square-inch spoonful with the steeped wine twice daily. Prepare one dose over three days.

**Treatment for Jiao-Long Disease:**
In the sixth year of the Kaihuang reign (586 CE), on the eighth day of the third month, a man contracted this disease after eating celery. His symptoms resembled epilepsy, with a greenish-yellow complexion. After consuming an excessive amount of cold *tang* (malt sugar), he vomited something resembling a *jiao*-dragon, complete with head and tail. Consuming three *dou* of cold *tang* proved highly effective.

**Treatment for Louse Masses (contracted by mountain dwellers who ingest lice, which grow in the abdomen):**
Take one old, broken comb and one old, broken hairpin.
Break each into two pieces, take one piece from each, and burn to ash.

Take the remaining half, boil with five *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng*, then consume the aforementioned burnt ash in one draught—it will be expelled immediately.

**For Rice Craving Disease (constant desire to eat rice; if rice is unavailable, clear water flows from the chest):**
One *sheng* of chicken droppings
Five *ge* of white rice
Stir-fry the two ingredients together until the rice is charred, then grind into powder. Take with two *sheng* of water in one draught until finished. Shortly after, the patient will vomit a substance resembling ground rice; if no rice is present, phlegm will be expelled. Thereafter, the patient will permanently loathe rice and no longer consume it.

**For Meat Craving Disease (insatiable desire for meat, with cravings recurring immediately after eating):**
On an empty stomach, drink three *sheng* of white horse urine. If meat is vomited, the patient will recover; if not, death is certain.

**For Hair Mass Disease (ingested hair goes unnoticed, lodging in the body over time; later, the patient feels as though insects move up and down in the chest, with an insatiable craving for oil, consuming up to two or three *sheng* in a day, and losing all appetite for other foods):**
Take one *sheng* of oil, heat with fragrant unguent, and store in a large *lao* vessel. Place it beside the patient’s head, positioning their mouth and nose above the oil without allowing them to drink. Apply the fragrant vapor to their nose until they cry out for the oil, but do not permit them to consume it. They will eventually exhaust themselves and fall into a deep sleep. The hair mass will then emerge from the mouth. Assign one person to watch closely and prepare a packet of lime powder. When the mass appears, use the powdered lime to grasp and pull it out completely—this is the hair. Initially emerging from the abdomen, it resembles thick seaweed in stagnant water, its form corresponding to the length of the hair.

**Alternative Formula:**
Three *sheng* of wine
Two *sheng* of lard, boiled three times
Consume one *sheng* twice daily.
White horse urine is also effective; if unavailable, white ox urine may be used.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
For *zheng* and *jia* masses: apply moxibustion to the depression behind the inner ankle, with the number of cones corresponding to the patient’s age.
Alternatively, apply one hundred cones to *Qihai* (CV 6).

For chronic cold, as well as *zheng* and *jia* masses in women, accompanied by intestinal rumbling, diarrhea, and colicky pain around the navel: apply one hundred cones to *Tianshu* (ST 25), repeating three times. The point is located two *cun* on either side of the navel. Do not needle.

For hard accumulations and fullness: apply one hundred cones to *Pimu* (the spleen’s alarm point), located at the end of the eleventh rib in *Zhangmen* (LR 13).

For hardness below the heart, cold accumulations, and distension: apply one hundred cones to *Shangguan* (CV 13), repeating three times. The point is located one *cun* below *Juque* (CV 14).

For large, hard accumulations the size of a plate, with cold distension: apply two hundred cones to *Weiguan* (CV 12), repeating three times. The point is located two *cun* below *Juque* (CV 14).

**Formulas for the Gallbladder Viscus**
**Discourse on the Gallbladder’s Pulse, Chapter One**

The discourse states: The gallbladder viscus governs the liver, and the liver unites its *qi* with the gallbladder. The gallbladder is the *viscus of central clarity*. The *Classic of Difficult Issues* (*Nanjing*) states: "The gallbladder is the *viscus of purity and tranquility*." The *Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion* (*Jia Yi Jing*) calls it the *viscus of central essence*. It is styled the "General’s Decision-Making Officer." Weighing three *liang* and three *zhu*, it measures three *cun* and three *fen* in length, situated beneath the liver’s short lobe. It stores two *ge* of watery essence-fluid (the *Nanjing* reads three *ge*). It can be wrathful or joyful, firm or yielding. If the flesh below the eyes is ample, the gallbladder lies horizontally.

All gallbladder, brain, marrow, bones, vessels, and the *uterus* (in women)—these six are born of *earth-qi*. They all store within *yin* and take the earth as their image, thus they store without discharging, and are named the *extraordinary and constant viscera*. As for the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, triple burner, and bladder—these five are born of *heaven-qi*. Their *qi* takes heaven as its image, thus they discharge without storing. They receive the turbid *qi* of the five viscera and are named the *transmitting and transforming viscera*, for they cannot retain substances long but must convey and discharge them.

The so-called five viscera store essence-*qi* (the *Jia Yi Jing* reads *spirit*) without discharging; thus they are full yet cannot be replete. The six bowels transmit and transform matter without storing; thus they are replete yet cannot be full. The reason is this: when grain and water enter the mouth, the stomach becomes replete while the intestines are empty; as food descends, the intestines become replete while the stomach is empty. Thus it is said: replete yet not full, full yet not replete.

If the *yang* pulse at the left *guan* position is cut off, there is no gallbladder pulse. The patient suffers knee pain, a bitter taste in the mouth, squinting eyes, timidity as if seeing ghosts, frequent fright, and lack of strength. Treat by needling the *Foot Jueyin* to regulate *yin*, located between the big toe, or by needling the center of the three hairs.

If the *yang* pulse at the left *guan* position is replete, the gallbladder is replete. The patient suffers abdominal discomfort and a creeping sensation throughout the body. Treat by needling the *Foot Shaoyang* to regulate *yang*, located one *cun* behind the base of the second toe on the foot.

In gallbladder disease, the patient often sighs deeply, has a bitter taste in the mouth, vomits stale fluid, and experiences palpitations with terror as if about to be seized. The throat feels obstructed, and there is frequent spitting. Examine the root and tip of the *Foot Shaoyang* channel; if the pulse is sunken, apply moxibustion. For alternating chills and fever, needle *Yanglingquan*. If the patient often vomits bitter fluid, sighs deeply, experiences palpitations, is prone to sorrow, and feels terror as if about to be seized, the evil lies in the gallbladder, counterflow in the stomach. Gallbladder fluid causes a bitter taste in the mouth; counterflow of stomach *qi* causes vomiting of bitter fluid—thus it is called *vomiting of bile*. Needle *Zusanli* below; for counterflow of stomach *qi*, needle the blood network of the *Foot Shaoyang* to close the gallbladder, then regulate deficiency and repletion to expel the evil.

In gallbladder distention, there is pain and distention beneath the ribs, a bitter taste in the mouth, and frequent sighing. When the liver first contracts disease, it transfers it to the gallbladder. If liver cough persists, the patient vomits bile. When *reverting qi* invades the gallbladder, the patient dreams of fighting and litigation. The *Jia Yi Jing* states: "dreams of fighting and litigation, or self-disembowelment."

The liver corresponds to the sinews. If the nails are thick and yellow, the gallbladder is thick; if the nails are thin and red, the gallbladder is thin. If the nails are hard and green, the gallbladder is tense; if the nails are soft and red, the gallbladder is slack. If the nails are straight, white, and unconstricted, the gallbladder is upright; if the nails are foul, black, and often cracked, the gallbladder is knotted.

Bian Que said: "The *Foot Jueyin* and *Shaoyang* are exterior-interior pairs. The exterior is clear, the interior turbid. If the disease is extreme repletion, it injures with heat; heat disturbs the spirit, which cannot be contained, causing restless sleep. If deficient, it injures with cold; cold causes fear, dizziness, inability to sleep alone, and the onset of *mysterious water* disease, whose root lies in the gallbladder. It first arises from the head and face, swelling down to the feet." The formula is found in the chapter on treating water diseases.

If the gallbladder is diseased, the eyebrows slant. If a patient’s eyebrow roots slant, death will occur within seven days.

The *Foot Shaoyang* channel: when it moves, the disease manifests as a bitter taste in the mouth, frequent sighing, pain in the heart and ribs making it impossible to turn over, and in severe cases, a dusty complexion and a body lacking luster. The outer foot is hot and turned outward—this is *yang* reversal. It governs diseases born of the bones: headache, pain in the temples and jaw, pain in the outer canthus, swelling and pain in the supraclavicular fossa, swelling beneath the armpit, *horse-sword* and *goiter* swellings, sweating, shivering with cold, malaria, and pain in the chest, ribs, thighs, knees, extending outward to the shin, *juegu*, the front of the outer ankle, and all joints, with the fourth toe unable to move. In repletion, the *renying* pulse is twice as large as the *cunkou*; in deficiency, the *renying* is smaller than the *cunkou*.

Its channel vessels and sinew branches are fully detailed in the section on the liver viscus.

**Pulse and Formulas for Gallbladder Deficiency and Repletion, Chapter Two**
**Moxibustion Methods**

**Gallbladder Repletion-Heat**
If the *yang* pulse at the left *guan* position is replete, it pertains to the *Foot Shaoyang* channel. The disease manifests as abdominal fullness of *qi*, inability to eat, dry throat, headache, chills, and rib pain—this is called *gallbladder repletion-heat*.

**Pinellia Decoction #1**
Treats gallbladder viscus repletion-heat, spirit failing to be contained, and drains heat:
*Pinellia* (3 *liang*), *ginger* (prepared, 3 *liang*), *scutellaria* (1 *liang*), *fresh rehmannia* (5 *liang*), *polygala* (2 *liang*), *poria* (2 *liang*), *glutinous rice* (1 *dou*).
Chop these eight ingredients. Boil the glutinous rice in five *dou* of long-flowing water from a thousand-*li* source until it reaches a crab-eye boil. Skim it over a thousand times, then let it settle and clarify. Take nine *sheng* of the clear liquid to decoct the herbs, reducing it to three and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

The *Collected Effective Formulas* treats deficiency vexation and inability to sleep. It omits *rehmannia* and *polygala*, adding *ophiopogon* (3 *liang*), *cinnamon* (3 *liang*), *licorice* (2 *liang*), and *ginseng* (2 *liang*).

**Formula for Gallbladder Disease in the Chest**
Apply moxibustion at *Zhuoyu* for as many cones as the patient’s age. The point lies five *cun* lateral to the gallbladder transport point.

**Gallbladder Deficiency-Cold**
If the *yang* pulse at the left *guan* position is deficient, it pertains to the *Foot Shaoyang* channel. The disease manifests as dizziness, reversal, atrophy, inability to move the toes, inability to rise from crouching, sudden collapse, yellowing of the eyes, and loss of essence (text corrupt). This is called *gallbladder deficiency-cold*.

**Warm the Gallbladder Decoction**
For treating vexing restlessness and inability to sleep following major illness—this arises from gallbladder cold. The formula is as follows:
*Pinellia* (2 *liang*), *bamboo shavings* (2 *liang*), *unripe bitter orange* (2 *liang*), *tangerine peel* (3 *liang*), *fresh ginger* (4 *liang*), *licorice* (1 *liang*).

**Discourse on the Throat Gate (Third)**
It is said: The throat gate corresponds to the five *zang* and six *fu*, the passage through which spirit-*qi* and yin-yang open and close. The larynx, pharynx, and tongue regulate the fluids and govern the root of the five flavors’ *qi*—how can one not study them?
The throat gate is the indicator of the liver and gallbladder. It weighs ten *liang*, spans two *cun* and five *fen*, and extends to the stomach tube, measuring one *chi* and six *cun* in length. It governs the passage of fluids, spirit-*qi*, and the five *zang* and six *fu*, corresponding to the twelve hours.
If the *zang* are hot, the throat gate closes and *qi* becomes obstructed; if the *fu* are cold, the throat gate ruptures and the voice turns hoarse—*mother ginger wine* governs this. (The formula appears in another volume.)
For heat, open it; for cold, supplement it. If cold and heat are harmonized, disease will not arise.

**Discourse on Marrow Deficiency and Excess (Fourth)**
**Formulas**
It is said: Marrow deficiency causes brain pain and restlessness. Marrow excess causes boldness and ferocity. All manifestations of marrow deficiency and excess are governed by the liver and gallbladder. If the *fu* or *zang* develop disease originating in the marrow, heat corresponds to the *zang*, and cold to the *fu*.

For forgetfulness, add *polygala* (1 *jin*); for severe deficiency taxation, add *schisandra* and *cistanche* (1 *jin* each); for dampness beneath the yin, add *acanthopanax root bark* (1 *jin*); if *dendrobium* is available, adding 1 *jin* is excellent. For each *jin* of added ingredient, increase the wine by seven *sheng*. This wine should be prepared in mid-late autumn (ninth month) and taken in early winter (tenth month). If other medicines are taken, using this wine to administer them is highly effective. Dry the dregs in the sun, pound into powder, and take with this wine—one *fangcunbi* spoonful, three times daily—this is even more beneficial. Adding ten *liang* of *licorice* is excellent; for deficiency taxation, add 1 *jin* of *astragalus*.

Follow the same prohibitions as for medicinal wines, and rest for twice the usual time.

**Asparagus Root Great Decoction, for treating the five taxations, seven injuries, eight winds, twelve impediments, and damage to the six extremes in men.**

**First, the six extremes:**
1. *Qi* extreme: manifests as frequent cold impediment, abdominal pain, panting, fright, and headache.
2. *Lung* extreme: manifests as cold impediment, lumbar pain, hardness below the heart, accumulations and gatherings, inhibited urination, and numbness of the hands and feet.
3. *Vessel* extreme: manifests as a sallow complexion, contrary intentions, frequent absentmindedness, qi collapse, a state resembling sorrowful weeping, stiff tongue, dry throat, aversion to cold and wind, inability to move, loss of appetite, dizziness, and reckless speech in anger.
4. *Sinew* extreme: manifests as hypertonicity, hardness and distention in the lower abdomen, heart pain, cold knees, and pain in all the joints of the limbs.
5. *Bone* extreme: manifests as reversal cold in the limbs, jaundice, wasting-thirst, abscesses and ulcers, sudden onset of severe illness, and floating swelling resembling water disease.
6. *Flesh* extreme: manifests as *zhi* illness resembling a blow, inability to speak, and in severe cases, death and revival—conditions beyond the reach of physicians.

These are all caused by the six extremes and seven injuries, not solely by sexual excess. Grief, anxiety, overthinking, joy, anger, sorrow, and elation, compounded by wind-dampness and bound *qi*, lead to coughing, vomiting, food transforming after eating, inhibited urination and defecation, frequent diarrhea with heavy discharge, bloody urine, counterflow *qi* with vomiting and diarrhea, alternating cold and heat, restless sleep, reddish-yellow urine, frequent nightmares, dreams of dining with the dead, entering tombs and spirit chambers, and the scattering of hun and po.

*Sinew* extreme damages the liver; liver damage causes the lumbar and back to pull on each other, making bending and lifting difficult.
*Qi* extreme damages the lungs; lung damage causes bloody urine and dim vision.
*Marrow* extreme causes impotence, inability to engage in intercourse.
*Bone* extreme damages the kidneys; kidney damage causes shortness of breath, inability to stand for long, yin pain with aversion to cold, and in severe cases, retracted testicles, sores beneath the yin, damp itching with incessant scratching, and oozing fluid—all kidney diseases. In severe cases, one often suffers wind-toxin, stubborn impediment in the limbs, swelling of the hands and feet, known as *jiao ruo* (leg weakness) or *jiao qi* (leg *qi*), untreatable by physicians. The following formula governs all these conditions:

*Asparagus root* (3.5 *dou*, chopped and pressed to extract all juice), *fresh rehmannia* (3.5 *dou*, chopped and pressed to extract all juice), *honey* (3 *sheng*, refined), *ghee* (3 *sheng*, refined), *lycium root* (3 *dou*, chopped, washed clean, boiled in 2.5 *shi* of water to yield 1.3 *dou* of clear decoction), *musk deer bone* (1 set, pounded, boiled in 1 *shi* of water to yield 5 *dou* of clear decoction).

Use a large *dou* measure and a copper vessel. First, gently simmer the *asparagus* and *rehmannia* juices until reduced by half, then combine all ingredients and decoct to yield two *dou*. Add the following powdered medicines and decoct to one *dou*. Transfer to a copper vessel and double-boil until the mixture can be rolled into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty pills on an empty stomach at dawn with wine, twice daily, increasing to fifty pills. Avoid raw, cold, sour, and slippery foods, pork, chicken, fish, garlic, oil, yeast, and the like. Choose a day of flourishing *qi* in one of the four seasons for preparation, following the methods described in the first volume’s "Combining and Harmonizing" section.

Grind the thirty-eight ingredients into powder and add to the decoction. Adding three *sheng* each of ox and deer marrow is excellent.

For inhibited urination, remove *biota seed* and add 2 *liang* of *gentiana* and 6 *liang* of *dried rehmannia*.
For impotence and seminal loss, remove *solomon’s seal* and add 2 *liang* of *schisandra*.
For head wind, remove *biota seed* and add 2 *liang* each of *chrysanthemum* and *siler*.
For frequent urination and weak yin *qi*, remove *asarum* and *siler*, and add 2 *liang* of *cornus*.
For cold in the abdomen, remove *siler* and add 2 *liang* of *dried ginger*.
If no other illnesses are present, prepare according to the original formula.

This decoction should be prepared on the day of *Li Dong* (Beginning of Winter) using herbs gathered in late autumn (ninth month), and taken until early summer (fifth month).

If prepared on the *La* day of the twelfth month, it should be taken until the seventh month after the Summer Solstice. Should the decoction remain unused through the summer without spoiling, bury it six *chi* deep in a shady spot north of the dwelling, filling the pit with sand. Place the decoction in the center, cover it with sand, and it will remain unspoiled through the summer.

Women who previously suffered from heat may take this; those with cold should not.

**On Hematemesis (Sixth Discourse)**
**Moxibustion Methods**

The Master of Linqiu states: Hematemesis manifests in three forms—internal hemorrhage, pulmonary abscess, and gastric injury.

**Internal Hemorrhage**
Blood emerges resembling epistaxis but does not exit through the nostrils; rather, it originates from the fluids near the heart and lungs, flowing back into the stomach. It may appear like bean broth or minced *zhi*, coagulating in the stomach. When fullness and oppression ensue, vomiting occurs, expelling quantities ranging from several *dou* to one *dan*. This arises from overexertion or excessive eating and drinking.

**Pulmonary Abscess**
Following alcohol consumption, toxins accumulate, causing oppression. When vomiting occurs, blood follows, ranging from one *ge* to half a *sheng* or one *sheng*.

**Gastric Injury**
After excessive eating, cold in the stomach impairs digestion, leading to vexation and oppression. Forceful retching propels food and qi upward, rupturing the stomach’s orifice. The vomited blood is bright red, accompanied by abdominal colic, cold sweats, and a tight, rapid pulse—rendering it difficult to treat.

**Question**
A patient presents with fullness and obstruction in the chest and flanks, impeding eating. At onset, a fishy, foul odor is detected, followed by clear fluid and blood-tinged sputum. The limbs grow cold, vision blurs, and blood is passed anteriorly and posteriorly. What is the name of this disease, and how is it contracted?

**Answer**
The disease is called *xueku* (blood desiccation). It arises from significant blood loss in youth, or from sexual activity while intoxicated, depleting the central qi and injuring the liver. Consequently, menstrual flow diminishes or ceases.

Treat with *wuzeigu* and *quru*, formed into pills with sparrow eggs, the size of small beans. Take five pills as an after-meal dose, washing down with abalone broth to benefit the intestines and heal the liver.

After hematemesis, if the body feels merely fatigued without heart oppression, spontaneous recovery occurs. However, if vexation, agitation, heart oppression, chaotic vomiting, and disorientation arise, and a physician administers *Huangtu Decoction* or *Ejiao Powder*, the condition worsens, leading swiftly to critical decline. In such cases of oppression, induce vomiting immediately with the following formula:

- *Guadi* (2 *fen*)
- *Duqiang*
- Ginseng (each 1 *fen*)

Grind, sift, and take 1 *qianbi*. If no water or broth is available, even a slight descent suffices. For the frail, reduce the dose slightly. Vomiting will expel green-yellow matter or one to two *sheng* of blood, without distress.

**Seventh Discourse: Pills and Powders for Myriad Diseases**

The Discourse states: The Dao of the sage is to compassionately aid all things. By broadly seeking myriad medicines, one prepares for the unforeseen. In moments of urgency, remedies are at hand, hence the formulas for myriad diseases.

As these formulas were scattered across various texts, I found scholars struggled to locate and apply them. Thus, I gathered the essential and wondrous ones into this compendium, that they may be readily accessed. May diligent gentlemen, even in times of peace, remember peril and prepare these remedies in advance to guard against illness.

Do not steam, roast, or stir-fry; simply shake off the dust, pound, and sift through a coarse sieve before use.

For all pork, chicken, the five pungent vegetables, raw or cold foods, vinegar, and slippery foods, consume freely without restriction. Only all beans nullify the medicine and must not be eaten.

**Ingredients for the Wine:**
- Three *liang* of medicinal powder
- Two *sheng* of fine yeast powder
- Three *sheng* of glutinous rice
- Five *sheng* of pure wine

First, boil three large *dou* of water to cook the rice into a congee, ensuring it is extremely soft. In winter, waft away the heat; in spring, let it cool slightly; in summer, waft until completely cold; in autumn, keep it slightly warm.

Next, add the yeast powder, kneading until thoroughly blended. Then add the medicinal powder, stirring vigorously until well incorporated. Finally, add the pure wine and stir thoroughly.

Store in a non-leaching vessel, stirring with a clean stick. After one night, it is ready to drink. Simply cover with cloth; no need for airtight sealing.

**Administration:**
Take on an empty stomach at dawn, adjusting the dose to achieve awareness. When a slight activation is felt, flowing into the limbs and face with a gentle sensation, cease increasing the dose. Proper use will lead to gradual internal dissolution. Excessive intake will induce severe vomiting and diarrhea.

For powder: Sift finely, take one square *cun* spoonful, and mix with water, wine, or liquid as available. Gradually increase the dose to achieve awareness.

For pills: Sift finely, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take seven pills per dose.

This medicine may be taken as pills or powder, but never as a decoction. For tonic effects without vomiting or diarrhea, simply achieve internal dissolution—its benefits surpass those of the Five Minerals, while also expelling all diseases, yielding unparalleled efficacy.

However, taking it as wine is superior to pills or powder: it is pleasant to consume, rapidly circulates, and is easily ingested. For those suffering long-term illnesses, chronic accumulations, retained food, enduring *qi* masses, *zheng* and *jia* accumulations, or all stubborn obstructions, increase the dose once or twice to induce vomiting and purging. After expelling all malign substances, reduce the dose for internal dissolution to achieve tonification.

**Precautions:**
Avoid eating early after taking the medicine, as early food may trigger severe vomiting, though it is harmless. The throat may become sore for two or three days before recovery. Users should be aware of this.

Take the medicine at dawn, and by midday, once its effects have stabilized, consume cold rice with cold watery liquid. After midday, when the medicine’s effects are fully settled, eat hot foods without restriction. If the medicine’s effects have not stabilized, do not force movement, as walking may cause dizziness, vertigo, or even fainting—this is due to the expulsion of wind and is not cause for alarm. Once the wind is fully expelled, even higher doses are beneficial. Otherwise, if dizziness occurs, simply lie or sit down; clarity will return momentarily, no different from usual. Once stabilized, move freely.

If needing to relieve oneself, use a staff for support. If slight dizziness occurs, sit immediately; clarity will return upon sitting, after which movement may resume.

For ailments above the diaphragm—long-standing cold phlegm, accumulations, congealed masses, hernial lumps, chronic food stagnation, hard clumps, coughing with counterflow qi, and all other deep-seated, severe conditions—where one spits and hawks all day, with counterflow qi surging upward into the chest and throat, these are all caused by accumulated cold at the stomach’s opening. Chronic cold in the Triple Burner and intestines gives rise to such illnesses.

In such cases, one must induce vomiting to expel these malign substances. For milder cases, a single dose will suffice, followed by another to provoke vomiting. For severe cases, administer three to five doses until the malign matter is fully expelled. The progression of vomiting follows this pattern: first, cold qi and froth; next, sour water; then, after a short while, thick, intensely bitter yellow fluid resembling ox saliva. If the illness is more advanced, purple phlegm resembling purple grass juice may be vomited—this is extremely foul, like decayed teeth. Those who produce this are invariably on the path to death and will surely die soon. If one with chronic phlegm vomits blood—old blood being dark and clotted, fresh blood bright red—the condition will be permanently cured after vomiting, never to recur.

When taking this emetic, one may experience great discomfort during vomiting, but this will stabilize shortly, leaving no weakness or fatigue. Afterward, consuming cold food and drink will prevent hollow deafness and numbness in the hands and feet. If the stomach’s opening has long harbored such ailments, a mass may lodge in the chest and throat during vomiting, neither expelled nor swallowed, causing extraordinary distress. In such cases, administer an additional one or two *ge* of the medicinal wine. Shortly after ingestion, the mass—often the size of a fist and resembling the yolk of a fertilized chicken egg—will be vomited. When it falls to the ground, it can be cut with a knife; severe cases may produce ten such masses, while milder ones yield three to five.

For those with the aforementioned conditions, if the medicine fails to induce vomiting, the illness may temporarily lessen, but it will recur within one or two years. Thus, emetics must be used. To induce vomiting, take the medicine in the third month of spring, as spring is the season for purging.

For cold above the diaphragm, fullness in the lower abdomen, intestinal rumbling, qi in the bladder, or chronic cold diarrhea, add a purgative to the medicinal wine to expel the malign matter. The purgative will produce stools resembling clear water, yellow fluid, or green mud. In milder cases, one or two doses of the purgative will fully eliminate the illness; in severe cases, five doses may be needed to induce repeated, copious bowel movements and eradicate the root of the disease. The purgative should be taken at dawn, and by late afternoon, two or three movements will occur—discontinue further doses afterward.

For those with chronic illness, the emaciated, the weak, the elderly, or the noble, administer smaller doses initially, gradually increasing over time to allow for internal resolution and cure. For long-standing illnesses, do not induce vomiting or purging.

If the medicine is taken in excess, causing unrelenting vomiting or diarrhea, take a *fangcunbi* of raw soybean powder with water to stabilize it, or chew indigo leaves or black soybean leaves and swallow the juice—relief will be immediate. This remedy is for severe distress; minor discomfort does not require it.

For those in the world who suffer from depletion, yang decline, emaciation, or skeletal frailty, this medicine provides extraordinary supplementation.

In summation: Searching through ancient records, I have found no mention of this formula. There was a man of lofty virtue, Li Xiaolong, who claimed to have received it from the mountain monk Hui Tong of Dingzhou during the early Sui dynasty. Thereafter, its use yielded remarkable efficacy, and it was guarded as a secret, transmitted only as a remedy without disclosure of its composition. I first obtained it from the Daoist adept Jing Zhi, and it has now been three cycles of twelve years since then. Though contemporary physicians of renown have not acknowledged it, whenever I have applied it, its divine efficacy has been undeniable.

Its application of medicinals follows no conventional sequence, and its regimen for consumption seems far removed from human norms. Yet when employed in urgent cases, its efficacy is extraordinary. One then realizes that numinous substances manifest their potency without adhering to ordinary constraints, and that the profound principles of resonance transcend the grasp of mere intellect—just as the dragon’s roar summons clouds or the tiger’s cry stirs the wind, phenomena that arise of themselves, their causes unknown even to sages.

Thus I record this at the end of the text to bequeath it to later generations. Let the diligent scholar examine it closely, for it not only offers profound relief to suffering beings but may also broaden one’s understanding.

The *Qipo Wan of Ten Thousand Illnesses* treats:
- Seven kinds of abdominal masses,
- Five kinds of epilepsy,
- Ten kinds of consumptive afflictions,
- Seven kinds of flying corpse [*feishi*] disorders,

And for conditions such as *hu*-odor, deafness, nasal congestion, and other ailments.

This remedy is taken in doses of three pills per treatment, and no more than three treatments are required to eradicate all diseases—its efficacy is boundless, hence the name *Pill for Ten Thousand Illnesses*. As it employs *niu-huang* (cattle bezoar) as its principal ingredient, it is also called *Niu-huang Pill*. And because it was devised by the renowned physician Jīvaka, it is further named *Jīvaka’s Pill Formula*.

**Ingredients:**
*niu-huang* (cattle bezoar), *she-xiang* (musk), *xi-jiao* (rhinoceros horn) – 1 *fen* each;
*sang-bai-pi* (mulberry root bark), *fu-ling* (poria), *gan-jiang* (dried ginger), *gui-xin* (cassia twig heart), *dang-gui* (Chinese angelica), *xiong-qiong* (ligusticum), *shao-yao* (peony), *gan-sui* (kan-sui root), *huang-qin* (scutellaria), *shu-jiao* (Sichuan pepper), *xi-xin* (asarum), *jie-geng* (platycodon), *ba-dou* (croton seed), *qian-hu* (peucedanum), *zi-wan* (aster), *pu-huang* (cattail pollen), *ting-li* (lepidium seed), *fang-feng* (saposhnikovia) – 1 *fen* each;
*wu-gong* (centipede) – three segments;
*shi-xi-yi* (stone lizard), *ren-shen* (ginseng) – 1 *cun* each;
*zhu-sha* (cinnabar), *xiong-huang* (realgar), *huang-lian* (coptis), *da-ji* (euphorbia), *yu-yu-liang* (limonite), *yuan-hua* (genkwa), *yuan-qing* (blister beetle) – seven pieces each.

(According to *Master Cui’s* version, *huang-qin*, *sang-bai-pi*, *jie-geng*, and *fang-feng* are omitted, making twenty-seven ingredients in total.)

All ingredients must be of the finest quality. *Niu-huang*, *she-xiang*, *xi-jiao*, *zhu-sha*, *xiong-huang*, *yu-yu-liang*, and *ba-dou* are ground separately; the rest are pounded together and sifted through fine silk. The powder is then blended with white honey and pounded three thousand times before being sealed for storage.

**Administration:**
On an auspicious day at dawn, take three pills the size of *wu-tong* seeds on an empty stomach with wine, aiming for a mild purging of three *sheng* of foul water as the desired effect. For sudden or acute illnesses, the remedy may be taken at any time of day, with vomiting or diarrhea as the therapeutic endpoint. If no purging occurs, increase the dose by one pill, up to three or five pills, until purging is achieved—do not adhere rigidly to a fixed number of pills, for if the illness is severe and the dose too small, purging will not occur, and no other cause should be suspected. If the reaction is delayed, administer a hot liquid to hasten the effect. If vomiting or diarrhea persists, consume two or three mouthfuls of vinegared rice to arrest it.

**Dietary and Activity Restrictions:**
For seven days after taking the remedy, avoid stale or foul-smelling foods, raw or cold items, sour or slippery foods, sticky grains, garlic, pork, fish, chicken, dog, horse, or donkey meat, undiluted wine, and sexual activity. After the seventh day, one may resume taking the remedy every other day, with the intervening day used for recuperation. During recovery, consume porridge or broth made from new rice, leek, and bone marrow—three or four light meals are most beneficial, though one should not eat to fullness. This remedy must not be taken by women who have recently given birth.

After purging, keep the mouth closed and speak little, resting in a warm, draft-free room with a heated bed. For travelers afflicted by sudden illness without access to liquids, urine may be used to swallow the pills.

For infants under one year of age suffering from illness, have the nursing mother take two pills the size of small beans, with vomiting or diarrhea as the therapeutic endpoint.

For recent or acute illnesses, a larger dose is used; for chronic conditions, a smaller dose is sufficient, with mild loose stools as the desired effect. In cases of sudden illness nearing death, take three pills the size of small beans to induce vomiting or diarrhea, which will bring recovery. For sudden *zhong-e* (strike by malevolent *qi*) with lockjaw, administer two pills the size of small beans with one *ge* of warm water, forcing them down the throat—mild purging will bring recovery.

For deafness or festering ears, wrap one pill the size of a small jujube pit in silk and insert it into the ear to bring recovery. For nosebleeds, take two pills the size of small beans to bring recovery.

For abscesses, clove sores, or deep-rooted sores, break open the swelling and insert one pill the size of a sesame seed once daily—the root will emerge on its own, bringing recovery. For bleeding from clove sores, mix the pill with lard and apply; if there is an opening, insert it into the hole to stop the bleeding.

For swelling of the chest, back, waist, or flanks, mix the pill with vinegar and apply to the swelling, changing the dressing once daily, and also take two pills the size of small beans orally.

For undigested breast milk causing abdominal distension and fullness, take two pills the size of rice grains, apply to the nipple, and let the child suckle; if not recovered, administer again.

To treat all forms of *gu* poison, demonic infestations, and ghost-induced illnesses—whether progressing or receding, with hard accumulations, heart pain as if gnawed, inability to sit or lie down, or seasonal malign qi, warm diseases, wind-heat, miasmic contagions that wipe out households, intermittent fevers resembling malaria, swollen and blocked throat preventing food or drink, vexation and fullness with shortness of breath, flushed face and eyes, red or yellow eyes, dry retching, vomiting, diarrhea with red or white discharge, heat qi like clouds, tendencies toward madness or self-harm, visions of ghosts, cold hands and feet, insatiable craving for cold water, flailing hands in the air, facial sores or abscesses, deafness, blindness, stiffness in the head, neck, or spine preventing movement, sudden itching of hands or feet, or possession by malevolent spirits, foxes, or demons causing wandering pain—use the following formula:

Musk (1 *liang*)
*Ma mu du gong* (1 *liang*)
*Te sheng yu shi* (1 *liang*)
Cinnabar (1 *liang*)
*Ma chi fan* (1 *liang*)
Realgar (1 *liang*)
Croton seeds (90 pieces)
*Qing ye ge* (1 *liang*) [one version omits this]

Grind the eight ingredients into powder, then pound the croton seeds into a paste. Combine and pound five thousand times, add honey, and pound another ten thousand times to form pills the size of small beans. Strong individuals take two pills; weaker ones take one. Once ingested, the medicine circulates throughout the body, penetrating both exterior and interior, descending from the head to pervade the five viscera and six bowels. The soul and spirit settle, and the disposition calms. If the illness is above the diaphragm, vomiting occurs; if below, diarrhea follows. For snake or insect poisons causing five-colored hot watery discharge, or if no vomiting or diarrhea occurs, the condition gradually resolves. All manner of worms, demons, foxes, ghosts, and long-standing hard accumulations dissolve and disperse. If the illness is external, sweating occurs; if internal, direct purging follows. The name of this medicine is withheld, hence this formula is unnamed.

**Immortal’s Jade Flask Pill Formula:**
Realgar (2 *liang*)
*Li lu* (2 *liang*)
Cinnabar (2 *liang*)
*Yu shi* (2 *liang*) [one version uses *fan shi*]
Croton seeds (2 *liang*)
*Ba jiao* (2 *liang*)
Aconite (2 *liang*)

First pound the croton seeds three thousand times; then add *yu shi* and pound another three thousand times; next add *li lu* and pound three thousand times; then add aconite and pound three thousand times; next add realgar and pound three thousand times; finally add cinnabar and pound three thousand times. Add honey and pound another ten thousand times for best results. If omitting cinnabar, add four *liang* of true vermilion instead. Each time ingredients are added, pound five hundred times, incorporating a small amount of honey to prevent the medicine from scattering.

Prepare the medicine on an auspicious day and hour under a kingly phase, with a purified child assisting for best results. On a clear, cloudless day, complete the medicine in daylight, seal it in an airtight container, and store it in a clean place. For adults, form pills the size of small beans.

To induce purging, fast the night before and take two pills at dawn. If no effect occurs, take warm congee to stimulate purging; if purging does not stop, drink cold water to halt it. Illness above the diaphragm induces vomiting; below, diarrhea. If gradual relief is desired or for preventive use, take two pills the size of sesame seeds.

For sudden possession with loss of consciousness, mix two pills with wine or hot water and force-feed into the throat. For ghost-induced illnesses of all kinds, take two pills with water twice daily. For men or women interacting with ghosts, exhibiting erratic singing or crying, or experiencing abdominal swelling with ceased menstruation resembling pregnancy, take two pills the size of mung beans with water three times daily and once at night. Alternatively, mix with vinegar to a syrup-like consistency and apply daily to the *shou jian* (wrist crease) and *xin zhu* (the first transverse crease on the wrist below the middle finger). By evening, also apply to the three yin and three yang meridians of the feet and the nostrils—recovery occurs in seven days. Additionally, take one pill the size of a sesame seed with water three times daily for thirty days.

For malign wind causing heart obstruction and breathlessness, take one pill. If abdominal sensations resemble worms burrowing toward the ribs with sharp, intermittent pain, this is malign wind—take two pills. For pent-up sorrow and qi stagnation in the chest and heart causing frequent belching, coughing, or stabbing chest pain, take three pills the size of sesame seeds three times daily. For sharp heart and abdominal pain or internal heat, take one pill the size of a sesame seed three times daily—recovery occurs in five days. For abdominal pain, distension, and loss of appetite, take one pill. For *pi* and phlegm retention, take one pill at dawn. For wind, cold, heart, or *xian* hernias causing acute abdominal pain during episodes, take two pills. For sudden qi ascent with exhalation but no inhalation, counterflow qi rushing to the throat, or sudden abdominal accumulations, take two pills twice daily. For hard accumulations and obstructions, take one pill three times daily until recovery. For long-standing intermittent fevers and old obstructions, take two pills. For undigested meat causing abdominal hardness and distension, take one pill for immediate recovery. For the three abdominal worms, fast the night before, then consume three pieces of grilled beef or mutton at dawn, followed by three pills the size of mung beans—worms will be expelled by midday.

If the worms are not expelled by midday, take two more pills—putrid worms will surely descend. For sudden *guan'ge* obstruction with inability to defecate or urinate, near-death distress, take two pills. For sudden *huoluan* cholera with heart and abdominal pain, vexation and fullness, vomiting and diarrhea, and counterflow cold in the extremities, take two pills. For severe dysentery, take one pill to halt the discharge. For malaria, take one pill before the onset, two after—it will cease. For alternating chills and fever, take one pill. For cold damage with inhibited flow, seasonal qi heat disease, take one pill with warm wine, cover thickly to induce sweating; if no sweat appears, take another until sweating occurs. For strangury, emaciation, and aching in all joints, take one pill three times daily. For sudden wind-swelling of the head, mix with vinegar or ointment and apply, then wrap with silk floss. For carbuncles, deep-rooted boils, scrofula, and incipient *xian* sores, mix with vinegar and apply. For unnamed malignant sores, ringworm, scabies, or ulcers, mix with ointment or vinegar, first wash the sore with hot water to remove scabs, dry, then apply. For *shu-xian* sores, mix with lard and apply, then have a brindled dog lick it. For water toxin poisoning, take two pills; if sores have already formed, mix three pills with vinegar and apply to the sore. For deafness with pus, blood, or discharge, or sudden deafness, wrap two pills in red millet husk and insert into the ear. For wind-reddened eyes with itching, blurred vision, tearing, or festering canthi, dissolve in honey like maltose and apply to the canthi. For toothache, wrap in silk and pack into the cavity. For *gu* toxin poisoning with blood vomiting and stabbing abdominal pain, take one pill the size of a sesame seed, gradually increasing to the size of a mung bean; also apply to the nostrils, or mix with ointment and spread across the abdomen and back, or burn to fumigate the mouth and nose. For poisoning from snakes, leeches, or other venomous creatures, or bites from rabid dogs or mad horses, mix with vinegar and apply, and take two pills with water. For postpartum ailments in women, menstrual blockage, or irregular cycles, take two pills twice daily. For women with stagnant qi in the chest, labored breathing, lower abdominal tension, and colicky pain around the navel, take one pill the size of a sesame seed with broth, gradually increasing to the size of a small bean. For all childhood illnesses, fright epilepsy, blockages, fever, or infants aged one hundred days to six months, place one pill the size of a millet grain on the nipple to administer; for children over one year, give one pill the size of a sesame seed three times daily with water. For childhood abdominal distension, heat toxin, undigested food, or accumulations, take one pill. For childhood chills and fever, headache, body heat, or vomiting of milk, take one pill the size of a sesame seed. For childhood emaciation, *dingxi*, inability to eat, or indigestion, take two pills with broth three times daily; mixing with vinegar to the size of a firmiana seed and applying to the abdomen is also effective. For all myriad diseases, the dosage does not exceed one or two pills—none will not be cured.

To travel, visit parents, or attend the sick, take one pill and wear one around the neck—no fear will arise. When entering a house of mourning, wear one pill to ward off all ghosts. When staying alone in mountains, marshes, tombs, shrines, or dense forests, burn one pill—all ghosts will flee and dare not approach. Mix one pill with wax to the size of a bullet, place in a crimson pouch, and bind to the arm—left for men, right for women—mountain spirits and demonic beings will all fear it.

Zhang Zhongjing’s *Three-Substance Emergency Pill*: Minister of Works Pei Xiu ground it into powder for treating all sudden and violent diseases of the heart and abdomen. The formula: equal parts rhubarb, dried ginger, and croton. All ingredients must be fresh and refined; adjust quantities as needed. First pound the rhubarb and dried ginger, sift into powder, then grind the croton to a paste, mix into the powder, and pound a thousand times. It may be used as is, or made into powder; honey may be added to form pills. Store in an airtight container to prevent loss of qi.

For *zhong'e* or *kewu* with abdominal distension, stabbing pain, clenched jaw, labored breathing, or sudden death resembling a corpse, take three pills the size of soybeans with warm water or wine; adjust dosage for the elderly or young. Prop the head up to ensure swallowing. If no revival occurs after a short while, administer three more. When bowel sounds and movement occur, with vomiting or diarrhea, recovery follows. If the jaw is already clenched, mix into a liquid and pour into the mouth, allowing it to enter between the teeth—highly effective.

*Great Qi-Regulating Pill* for treating all diseases:
Two *liang* each of achyranthes, licorice, ginseng, poria, polygala, dichroa, sophora, salvia, adenophora, gentian, peony, *shanyao*, pinellia, apricot kernel, aster, dragon bone, *tianxiong*, aconite, pueraria, and tangerine peel; croton and *langya*; three *liang* each of rhubarb, oyster shell, and atractylodes; six *fen* of *baiwei*; ten *fen* of scrophularia; one large *lilu* root; five *liang* of fresh ginger shavings. Pound and sift the twenty-seven ingredients, cook the fresh herbs until done, then pound the croton and apricot kernel into a paste, mix thoroughly, add white honey, and pound five thousand times. Form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take seven pills on an empty stomach with wine, three times daily. For *shan* conglomerations, *jia* accumulations, or *zheng* concretions, take for fifty days for permanent cure. I have often used this to regulate qi and found it highly effective.

*Great Musk Pill* for treating *guizhu* ghost infestation, flying corpse, and all diseases:
Three *fen* of musk; two *fen* each of bezoar, aconite, *guiwu*, pearl, *mangcao*, rhinoceros horn, alum, asarum, cinnamon, otter liver, and *lilu*; one each of centipede and lizard; two *liang* of cinnabar; one *liang* of realgar; fifty each of croton and apricot kernel; seven each of *didan* (or *qingshe* gall in the *Waitai*), *yuanqing*, *tingzhang*, and blister beetle; eight *fen* of *yushi*.

The above twenty-three ingredients are ground into powder, mixed with honey, and pounded an additional three thousand times. Take one pill the size of a small bean with water, twice daily, gradually increasing to three pills. For insect or venomous stings, apply topically until relief is felt. When entering regions afflicted by plague, epidemic, or places of death and illness, or when passing through haunted graves, store the pills in a crimson pouch—men on the left, women on the right—tied to the elbow. A small amount may also be applied beneath the nose at the philtrum to prevent nightmares.

*Minor Musk Pill*, treating the same conditions as the *Great Musk Pill*:
Three *fen* of musk; four *fen* each of realgar and *danggui* (*Waitai* omits *danggui*); four *fen* of cinnabar; five *fen* each of dried ginger, cinnamon, and peony; two *fen* each of *mangcao*, rhinoceros horn, and gardenia seed; fifty croton seeds; five each of aconite and *wutou*; one centipede. The above fourteen ingredients are ground into powder, with five *fen* of asarum added, mixed with honey, and pounded one thousand times. Take three pills the size of small beans, three times daily, increasing to five pills. This treats all forms of *shizhu* corpse infestation and pain.

*Purple Vine Pill* for treating all heat imbalances:
Three *fen* each of purple vine, gypsum, ginseng, *danshen*, asarum, *zishen*, *kushen*, *xuanshen*, halite, hematite, *congong*, croton, and *wutou*; five *fen* each of dried ginger, cinnamon, and *duhuo*. The above sixteen ingredients are ground into powder, mixed with honey, and pounded ten thousand times. Take six pills the size of small beans—three before meals and three after. Avoid the five pungent vegetables, pork, chicken, fish, and garlic; other foods are unrestricted. If the body feels excessively hot, reduce the dose by one pill. This formula promotes weight gain, radiant complexion, virility, and appetite. After ten days of use, passing yellow or white fluid in the stool is highly auspicious. Women should take only two pills, one before and one after meals. Children under two should take a dose the size of a grain of rice. It enables one to drink alcohol, eliminates all diseases, and its effects—both benefits and adjustments—are described as follows:

It treats abdominal accumulations, fullness in the chest and abdomen, hardness below the heart, retained food, phlegm-rheum, vomiting after eating, rising qi, cough, wheezing throat, shortness of breath, jaundice, chronic malaria, facial swelling, heaviness and fatigue in the limbs, generalized edema, difficulty sitting or standing due to weight, heat diseases with dampness and itching of the lower body, prolapsed rectum, hot strangury, blockage of the orifices, diarrhea, emaciation with unstable complexion and weakness, impotence with scant or cold semen, body sores and itching, mottled skin, trauma from high falls, postpartum blood damage, scorched or rotting flesh, irregular menstruation (early or late), menstrual cessation with chest fullness and oppression, heavy shoulders, all pediatric diseases, infantile *pi* qi with undigested milk, and children with persistent fever and internal ailments. All listed conditions are treated by the *Purple Vine Pill*. If symptoms persist after prolonged use, adjust the dosage according to the formula until cured, then discontinue. The formula is cold in nature and particularly suitable for those suffering from heat. Do not transmit this secret formula.

*Taiyi Divine Essence Elixir*, treating sudden afflictions, cholera, abdominal pain and distension, corpse infestation, malign winds, madness with ghostly speech, *gu* toxins, demonic possession, warm malaria, and all forms of malign poisons—nothing it does not cure:

Four *liang* each of cinnabar, *zengqing*, orpiment, realgar, and magnetite; two and a half *liang* of *jinya*. The above six ingredients are individually ground and sifted through silk. Only cinnabar, orpiment, and realgar are soaked in aged vinegar; *zengqing* is steeped in fine wine in a copper vessel, sealed with paper, and exposed to sunlight for one hundred days (or at least five days if urgent; if no sun, warm with fire). Each is then ground into fine powder, mixed with sour vinegar to an appropriate consistency, placed in an earthen crucible, and sealed with *liuyi* clay to prevent qi leakage. After drying, an iron ring is attached to elevate the crucible fifteen *cun* above the ground. A fire is gradually applied, using any type of charcoal—soft or hard. Initially, two *sheng* of mature charcoal, each four *cun* long, are placed beneath the crucible. When two-thirds have burned, more is added, repeating this three times until all mature charcoal is used. Then, raw charcoal is added, increasing the fire gradually. After one full day and night, when the fire nearly reaches the crucible, it is fully stoked beneath. This is repeated twice before extinguishing the fire. Once completely cooled, the elixir is removed. The refined essence ascends and congeals on the crucible, with five-colored elixirs being superior, three-colored next, and single-colored inferior. Even if not five-colored, a luminous, snow-white appearance is best. If the ascent is incomplete, repeat the firing process. The elixir is collected with a rooster’s wing, ground into a paste like jujube pulp, and formed into millet-sized pills.

Another version states: Two *jin* each of cinnabar, *zengqing*, realgar, and orpiment. Cinnabar is soaked in strong vinegar in a ceramic vessel; *zengqing* in fine wine, sealed with paper, and sun-exposed for one hundred days. Realgar and orpiment are fried in oil for nine days and nights, the oil removed, and then pounded thousands of times—without grinding. They are separately mixed with strong vinegar to a moist consistency and placed in an earthen crucible, layered in the order: realgar at the bottom, then orpiment, *zengqing*, and cinnabar. The crucible is sealed with sweet clay, leaving no gaps, and fired with hard charcoal for nine days and nights, maintaining a five-*cun* distance from the crucible. This is repeated for another nine days and nights until reaching the crucible’s base, then for another nine days and nights, penetrating three *cun* into the crucible’s belly—totaling twenty-seven days. It is cooled for one day and night, then a knife is used to cut a clean circle around the crucible’s edge to open it and retrieve the elixir. Once formed, the elixir is finely ground into powder and mixed with jujube paste.

All elixirs must use jujube paste rather than honey—practitioners should take note of this method. Formerly, magnetite and *jin-ya* (golden teeth) were not employed, but now they are added. This elixir is most effective for treating hemiplegia, leprosy, severe illnesses, epilepsy, joint pain, and demonic afflictions.

**Dosage and Administration:**
Take one pill the size of a millet grain at dawn on an empty stomach. For chronic malaria that has resisted all remedies, accompanied by abdominal distension, labored breathing, and swelling of the face and limbs—even in near-death cases—one pill will induce vomiting and cure the condition, though some may recover without vomiting. If neither vomiting nor recovery occurs, take one and a half pills; if still ineffective, increase the dose by half a pill every other day until recovery is achieved. The qi will stabilize, and green, yellow, or white matter may be expelled. For those with malarial accumulations beneath the ribs, these will also dissolve.

If there is no abdominal distension, one pill may be taken daily, gradually increasing the dose until the desired effect is observed. Vomiting is not strictly necessary, as some may recover with a single pill. Avoid administering multiple doses at once; a three-day interval between doses may also be appropriate. Adjust according to the patient’s condition and the elixir’s potency. If the abdomen contains fluid and immediate purging occurs, do not be alarmed.

For recent malaria cases where the patient remains vigorous, the practitioner may combine two pills into one and administer them at once. All meals should be taken after midday, neither too hot nor too cold—fermented soybean broth or congee may be consumed freely.

For malaria with night sweats and weakness, take one pill daily for three days; vomiting will cease upon recovery. For malaria without sweating, where qi does not circulate and the feet are cold, take one pill for up to three days. If sweating occurs, qi is restored, and the feet warm before the third day, vomiting will cease. For malaria with pallor, the complexion will improve within three days of taking the elixir.

Some require vomiting to recover, while others may be cured with minimal doses. Strong individuals may need three or four pills before the elixir takes effect. Since constitutions vary, begin with a pill the size of a millet grain and gradually increase the dose as needed. The elixir’s potency is formidable—avoid excessive consumption. Strictly abstain from oils, fermented grains, fish, meat, and garlic; maintain purity while taking the medicine.

For long-term bedridden patients who are emaciated, suffering from abdominal distension, swelling, or chronic diarrhea—conditions often fatal—administering this elixir may save three or four out of ten.

**Additional Applications:**
For abdominal masses and accumulations, take one *dao-gui* (scant measure) with water. It also treats sudden death, possession, demonic assault, cholera with abdominal fullness, the five corpse afflictions, malign winds, demonic obstructions, contagious epidemics, family-wide fatalities, madness with ghostly speech, and cases where the patient appears dead but retains faint warmth in the chest. Prop the head up, pry open the mouth (if necessary, break two teeth), and administer the elixir with water—revival will follow upon ingestion.

For chronic illnesses, take one *dao-gui* daily and cover the patient to induce sweating; recovery follows perspiration. If no improvement occurs, a second dose may be taken. Some recover without sweating, while others require additional doses—follow the above method, increasing by half a *dao-gui* until cured.

Carry nine *dao-gui* doses in a crimson pouch—men on the left, women on the right, children on the head—to ward off miasmic toxins, malign seasonal qi, and demonic arrows.

For childhood ailments, mix the elixir with vinegar and apply to a square-inch of paper, placing it on the child’s chest or abdomen. For those already deceased—up to two days in winter or one day in summer—administering the elixir may revive them if it reaches the stomach; otherwise, revival is impossible.

When *jin-ya* and magnetite are added, the first five doses may induce vomiting and diarrhea, but these effects will subside thereafter. Begin with pills the size of small beans, then gradually reduce the size—never increase it.

For leprosy and severe malign sores, twenty doses may be taken; for hemiplegia, joint pain, and other malign wind-related illnesses, twenty doses are also appropriate. For other severe conditions, one or two doses suffice—adjust according to the patient’s strength and severity of illness. Do not overprescribe.

To neutralize the elixir’s toxicity, consume thoroughly boiled fatty pork. After ingestion, mild headaches or fever may occur for a day or two, and appetite may temporarily diminish. Normal taste and appetite will gradually return after five days, but avoid overeating. If the elixir causes distress or confusion, boil *mu-fang-ji* (stephania root) into a decoction and drink it to restore equilibrium.

**Note on Measurements:**
One *dao-gui* equals six grains of millet. Alternatively, it may be defined as three small beans.

**Method for Crafting Earthen Crucibles:**
Take two large earthenware basins, each holding approximately two *dou*, and coat their interiors with sweet clay, ensuring thorough drying.

**Alternative Method:**
Use one earthenware crucible and one wrought-iron crucible, each holding nine *sheng*. Place the earthenware crucible on top and the iron one below. The size may vary according to the quantity of elixir—strict adherence to these measurements is unnecessary.

**Another Version:**
Pound fine sweet clay, sift it through silk, and mix with water to a consistency like brick clay. For every *sheng* of clay, add finely chopped paper and pound until it can hold ten *jin* of elixir. Adjust the size based on the quantity of elixir. Dry in the shade for thirty days, then expose to sunlight for another thirty days, turning it toward the sun morning and evening. Once fully dried, place the crucible in a bed of five *shi* of chaff, surrounding it on all sides with earthen barriers to a thickness of seven *cun* above and below. Ignite a fire beneath it and maintain it for five days and nights without disturbance. After cooling for a day and night, remove the crucible, sweep it clean, and coat the interior with a thin layer of lead oxide mixed with vinegar to a porridge-like consistency, ensuring a thickness of one *fen* before adding the elixir.

For all major elixirs—Ninefold Cinnabar, Eight Minerals, Summoning the Soul, Supreme Clarity, and Immortal Transcendence—this crucible must be used. When crafted thus, it will endure ten thousand firings without flaw, never failing in its function. Discard all ancient crucibles, Six-One Clay, and iron vessels; never use them again. A single crucible of this kind may be employed dozens of times without deterioration, growing ever more steadfast with age.

This method was closely guarded by my master, yet I wish to ensure that future scholars across the world may comprehend it. Thus, I have set it forth in meticulous detail.

**Method for Six-One Clay:**
- Red halloysite: 2 *liang*
- Oyster shell: 2 *liang*
- Talc: 2 *liang*
- *Yushi* stone: 2 *liang*
- Yellow alum: 2 *liang*
- Bittern soil: 2 *liang*
- Earthworm castings: 2 *liang*

Grind the above ingredients, then mix with vinegar to the desired consistency. If bittern soil is unavailable, substitute with *guan* salt. First prepare the brick clay, then individually wrap each of the five ingredients—yellow alum and the others—in the clay, forming sealed balls to prevent the escape of *qi*. Fire them for three full days for best results, though one day will suffice. After firing, break open the balls, retrieve the ingredients, grind them finely, and sift through silk. Then combine them in equal parts with earthworm castings and bittern soil, mixing with vinegar to a thick porridge-like consistency. If fine vinegar is available, use two parts vinegar to one part water. Coat the interior of the previously prepared earthen basin with this clay.

For the *cengqing* (azurite), earthworm castings are ideal, though *huanglian* (coptis) is also excellent. Such materials are rare in the world, but fine *kunlun lu* (malachite) may serve as a substitute. Cinnabar should be of the brightest hue, though coarse cinnabar will suffice.

Formerly, magnetite and *jinya* (native gold) were not used, but they are now included. This formula is supremely effective in treating all manner of pernicious winds.

For ailments that have resisted treatment for years or even decades, this method must be employed. Prepare it on a day of royal ascendancy, under clear skies, after fasting, bathing, and purifying oneself. Follow the method precisely.

It is said: The immortals of old used this to succor the world, guarding it as their most profound secret. During the Daye era, I prepared it many times but struggled to obtain realgar and *cengqing*. Later, in Shu, I found realgar sold cheaply, and in Feiwu and Xuanwu, I acquired a great quantity of *cengqing*. The people of Shu did not recognize it, but those who do should examine its size and shape—anything resembling earthworm castings is the true substance. Though it may cost a thousand gold, it is worth seeking. Thus, in Shu County, at the home of the Wei family, I crafted a crucible and used it to treat illnesses with miraculous efficacy. Chronic wind-*qi* disorders that had persisted for a hundred days were cured in all who took it. Hence, I record this account.

**Note on Realgar:**
Realgar must be simmered in oil for nine days and nights before it may be incorporated into elixirs. Otherwise, it remains toxic. Never use it raw, lest the elixir become scorching and unfit for consumption. Exercise utmost caution.

**Cang Gong Powder**
For sudden attacks by malevolent spirits, ghostly paralysis, spectral piercing, stabbing pains in the heart and abdomen, bloody flux leading to death and loss of consciousness, or nightmares where one is bitten on the heel without waking—all afflictions of vicious *qi*—this formula, devised by Chunyu Yi, the Grand Granary Master of Emperor Wen of Han, is named accordingly.

- *Tesheng yushi* stone
- Chinese honey locust
- Realgar
- False hellebore

Grind the four ingredients in equal parts and sift.

Administer a dose the size of a large soybean, place it in a tube, and blow it into the patient’s nostril. Once sneezing occurs, the *qi* will flow freely and the patient revive. If no sneezing follows, repeat the application until sneezing is achieved. This medicine revives the dead and restores life.

**Minor Gold-Tooth Powder**
For miasmic epidemics of the southern regions, leg weakness, wind-borne malevolence, and spectral infestations:

- Gold tooth: 5 *fen*
- Realgar
- *Bi xie*
- *Huang qin*
- Sichuan pepper
- *You ba*
- Cinnamon bark
- *Mang cao*
- *Tian xiong*
- Cinnabar
- Musk
- *Wu tou*: each 2 *fen*
- Ox bezoar: 1 *fen*
- Centipede: 1 (six *cun* in length)
- *Xi xin*
- *Wei rui*
- Rhinoceros horn
- Dried ginger: each 3 *fen*
- *Huang lian*: 4 *fen*

Grind the nineteen ingredients, sift, and combine with ox bezoar and musk. Pound three thousand times. Take five *qianbi* with warm wine, three times by day and twice by night, until improvement is observed. Store in a crimson pouch and wear—men on the left, women on the right. Use a square-inch spoonful to prevent illness, ensure filial inquiries, and allow safe travel at night. Apply to the philtrum and against morning and evening mists. The powder also repels all malign influences.

**Major Gold-Tooth Powder**
For all forms of *gu* poison, the hundred spectral afflictions, and inauspicious conditions beyond medical remedy:

- Gold tooth
- Stork bone
- Gypsum: each 8 *fen*
- Blister beetle: 7 *fen*

- *Di dan*
- *Chu ji*
- *Yuan qing*: each 7
- Peach kernel parasite
- Croton: each 14

Grind the fifty ingredients and sift. Take one *daogui*, gradually increasing to two *daogui*. Wearing it repels the hundred evils and cures ninety-nine spectral afflictions.

One version includes musk but omits *bai zhu*.

**Heart Viscera Formulas**
**Discourse on the Heart Viscera and Its Pulse (I)**

The Discourse states: The heart governs the spirit. The spirit is the root of the five viscera’s concentrated essence, serving as sovereign and overseer of the four directions. It reigns for seventy-two days in summer, its position in the south, the Fire Palace of *Li*. The advent of life is called essence; the union of two essences is called spirit; that which bears all things is called the heart. The spirit is the heart’s repository.

The tongue is the heart’s official. Thus, the heart’s *qi* communicates with the tongue, and when the tongue is harmonious, it can discern the five flavors. The heart’s orifice is the ear. The heart is Fire, the kidney is Water, and Water and Fire mutually assist one another. Though the heart’s *qi* communicates with the tongue, the tongue is not its orifice; its communication with orifices is manifested through the ear. The left ear corresponds to *bing*, the right to *ding*, circulating through the flaming palace, ascending to the lips. The mouth knows taste, and the ears flourish with vitality. Externally, the heart governs blood; internally, it governs the five notes.

The heart weighs twelve *liang*, containing three hairs and seven apertures, holding three *ge* of essence-fluid. The spirit is named *Xuxu*, master of the stored spirit, called the Abode of the Five Spirits. It responds to the seasons’ nodes, hence it is said the heart stores the pulse, and the pulse houses the spirit. In *qi*, it manifests as swallowing; in fluids, as sweat.

When the heart’s *qi* is deficient, sorrow is unending; when replete, laughter knows no rest. If the heart’s *qi* is deficient, one dreams of rescuing from fire; if yang essence prevails in its season, one dreams of conflagration. If the heart’s *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of joy, laughter, and terror. When counterflow *qi* invades the heart, one dreams of mountains and smoke.

The heart, resembling Fire, pairs with the small intestine as its *fu*. Its channel is Hand Lesser Yin, externally and internally linked with Greater Yang. Its pulse is surging, corresponding to spring and ruling in summer. In summer, the myriad things flourish abundantly, their branches drooping with leaves, all bending downward like hooks—hence the name "hook."

The heart’s pulse is surging, vast, and long. Surging indicates the defensive *qi* is replete, and repletion means *qi* has no exit. Vastness indicates the constructive *qi* is budding; when budding and surging contend, sweat may be induced—hence the name "long." When long and surging harmonize, they draw water and broth to irrigate the channels and network vessels, moistening the skin. Greater Yang’s surging vastness is the mother’s form; fortunately, it obtains *wu* and *ji* to secure its roots. When yang *qi* ascends and exits, sweat appears on the head, the five viscera desiccate, the bladder becomes empty, and if the physician mistakenly purges, this compounds deficiency.

If the pulse floats with an exterior but no interior, yang has no agent, endangering not only the self but also the mother. The summer pulse is like a hook—the summer pulse is the heart’s, the Fire of the south, by which the myriad things flourish and grow. Thus, its *qi* arrives exuberant and departs diminished, hence called "hook." Reversal of this indicates illness.

What constitutes reversal? If its *qi* arrives exuberant and departs likewise, this is called excess, and the illness is external. If it arrives unexuberant but departs exuberant, this is called insufficiency, and the illness is internal. Excess causes generalized heat and cutaneous pain, manifesting as spreading sores. Insufficiency causes vexation, with coughing and spittle above and *qi* efflux below.

The heart’s pulse arrives in successive beads like strung pearls, smoothly gliding like jade—this is normal, with summer’s stomach *qi* as its foundation. If the heart’s pulse arrives panting and continuous, with subtle curvature, this indicates heart disease. If it arrives bent forward and receding like grasping a belt hook, this indicates heart death.

The true heart pulse arrives firm and forceful, like stroking the seeds of Job’s tears in succession, its color a dull red-black, lusterless, with brittle hair—only then does death ensue.

In summer, a faintly hooked stomach *qi* is normal. More hook and less stomach *qi* indicate heart disease; hook without stomach *qi* indicates death. Stomach *qi* with stone-like qualities indicates winter illness; pronounced stoniness indicates present illness.

The heart stores the pulse, and the pulse houses the spirit. Apprehension, anxiety, and excessive thought injure the spirit. When the spirit is injured, fear and self-loss arise, with emaciation, brittle hair, and pallid complexion—death occurs in winter.

If Hand Lesser Yin’s *qi* is cut off, the pulse ceases. Lesser Yin is the heart’s pulse, and the heart is the pulse’s union. If the pulse ceases, blood does not flow; if blood does not flow, the hair loses luster, and the face becomes black as lacquered firewood. When blood dies first, *ren* is critical and *gui* brings death—Water overcomes Fire.

When the heart, a dead viscus, is felt, it floats replete like beans or sesame striking the hand; pressing it increases agitation—this indicates death.

In summer, the heart Fire reigns, and its pulse is floating, vast, and dispersed (alternately: wiry)—this is normal. If it is instead wiry, fine, and long, this is the liver overbearing the heart, the mother returning to the child, a vacuous evil—though ill, it is easily treated. If it is vast and moderate, this is the spleen overbearing the heart, the child overbearing the mother, a replete evil—though ill, it will self-resolve. If it is deep, soft, and slippery, this is the kidney overbearing the heart, Water overcoming Fire, a thief evil—greatly perverse, ten deaths without cure. If it is faint, rough, and short, this is the lung overbearing the heart, Metal encroaching on Fire, a minor evil—though ill, it soon recovers.

When the kidney overbears the heart, there is certain blockage.

If the yin pulse at the inch opening before the left bar is cut off, there is no heart pulse. One suffers heat and pain below the heart, heat in the palms, frequent retching, and oral ulceration—needle Hand Lesser Yang to treat yang.

If the yin pulse at the inch opening before the left bar is replete, the heart is replete. If there is water *qi* below the heart, sorrow and anger provoke it—needle Hand Heart Governor to treat yin.

When the heart’s pulse arrives in successive beads like strung pearls, smooth and uninhibited, two beats are normal; three beats indicate departure from the channel and illness; four beats, essence collapse; five beats, death; six beats, life’s end—this is the Hand Lesser Yin pulse.

The heart pulse, when excessively tense, causes convulsions and spasms; when slightly tense, it causes heart pain radiating to the back, with inability to eat. When excessively slack, it causes manic laughter; when slightly slack, it causes *fuliang* below the heart, moving up and down, sometimes with blood in the spittle. When excessively large, it causes throat obstruction; when slightly large, it causes heart impediment radiating to the back, with frequent nosebleeds. When excessively small, it causes frequent retching; when slightly small, it causes wasting-thirst. When excessively slippery, it causes frequent thirst; when slightly slippery, it causes heart mounting radiating to the navel, with rumbling in the lower abdomen. When excessively rough, it causes aphonia; when slightly rough, it causes blood overflow and *weijue*, with tinnitus and epilepsy.

When the heart pulse is forceful, firm, and long, the illness will be curled tongue and inability to speak; when it is soft and scattered, the illness will be pain and thirst that resolve spontaneously. (Thirst: an alternate version reads "ringing.")

When the red pulse arrives, panting and firm, the diagnosis is: there is accumulated *qi* within, which periodically harms eating—this is called heart impediment. It arises from external illness, contemplation, and heart vacuity, so that evil follows.

Bian Que said: When the heart is diseased, the mouth develops sores and ulceration. The heart’s sound is laughter, its change and movement is sorrow, its will is joy. Joy injures the heart; when essence and *qi* converge in the heart, there is joy. When the heart is vacuous, there is sorrow; sorrow leads to worry. When replete, there is laughter; laughter leads to joy.

The heart governs summer; illness at this time may worsen at certain hours. Know its source, select its transport points, observe its correspondences, and examine its harms.

When illness first arises in the heart, there is heart pain. After one day, it moves to the lung, causing panting and coughing. After three days, it moves to the liver, causing rib-side pain and propping fullness. After five days, it moves to the spleen, causing blockage and obstruction, body pain, and heavy weight. If it does not resolve within three days, death occurs—at midnight in winter, at midday in summer.

When the illness is in the heart, there is clarity at midday, severity at midnight, and calm at dawn. If, for example, heart disease arises from traveling north or eating pork or fish, and not from these, it will erupt in winter, with onset on *ren* or *gui* days.

The manifestations of heart disease are: pain within the chest, propping fullness in the rib-sides, pain below both rib-sides, pain between the breast and back and in the shoulder blades, and pain in the inner arms. When vacuous, there is enlargement of the chest and abdomen, with pain drawing from the rib-sides to the lower back—select the Hand Lesser Yin and Greater Yang channels, and bleed below the tongue. For its transmuted diseases, bleed the *xi* points.

When the heart pulse is deep, small, and tight, and floating it does not pant, one suffers from *qi* gathering below the heart with pain, inability to eat, frequent swallowing of spittle, occasional heat and vexation in the hands and feet, forgetfulness, displeasure, and frequent sighing—this arises from sorrow and contemplation.

In heart disease, the complexion is red. There is heart pain, shortness of breath, vexing heat in the palms, or weeping, laughter, cursing, scolding, sorrowful thoughts, and anxious contemplation. The face is red, the body is hot, and the pulse is replete, large, and rapid—this is treatable. It is appropriate to administer the proper medicinals.

In spring, one should needle *Zhongchong*; in summer, *Laogong*; in late summer, *Daling*—all with supplementation.

In autumn, needle *Jianshi*; in winter, *Quze*—both with drainage. This pertains to the Hand *Jueyin* Pericardium Channel.

One should also moxa *Juque* with fifty cones and the fifth thoracic vertebra on the back with one hundred cones.

When evil resides in the heart, it causes heart pain and frequent sorrow, occasional dizziness and collapse. Assess whether there is excess or deficiency and regulate its *shu*-points.

Grief, sorrow, contemplation, and anxiety injure the heart. When the heart is injured, one suffers from susceptibility to fright, joy, taboos, and anger.

When the heart is struck by wind, there is a mild fever, inability to rise, hunger in the heart, and vomiting after eating.

When the heart is struck by cold, the person experiences heart pain as if consuming garlic paste; in severe cases, the pain pierces through to the back, and the back pain pierces through to the heart, resembling *gu*-possession. If the pulse is floating, spontaneous vomiting will bring recovery.

When the heart is injured, the person becomes fatigued, the face and head redden, and there is a heavy sensation below, with heart pain piercing through to the back, spontaneous vexation and fever, and scant *qi*. This pertains to the heart, with pulsation below the navel and trembling hands. If the pulse is wiry, this arises from injury to the heart organ.

When evil causes weeping that disturbs the *hun* and *po*, it is due to insufficiency of blood and *qi*. Such insufficiency pertains to the heart. When heart *qi* is deficient, the person becomes fearful, closes their eyes wishing to sleep, dreams of distant journeys, and experiences dispersion of essence and spirit, with *hun* and *po* wandering recklessly.

When *yin* *qi* declines, it results in *dian*; when *yang* *qi* declines, it results in *kuang*. The five viscera are the dwelling places of the *hun* and *po*, the abodes of essence and spirit. When the *hun* and *po* fly astray, the five viscera are empty, and evil spirits reside within. Spirits and numina command ghosts to descend, the pulse is short and faint, and when the viscera are insufficient, the *hun* and *po* are unsettled. The *hun* belongs to the liver, the *po* to the lungs. The lungs govern fluids, which manifest as snivel and tears. When lung *qi* is deficient, tears flow; when liver *qi* is deficient, the *hun* is unsettled. The liver governs anger, and its sound is shouting.

In heart water, the person’s body is swollen (or heavy) and short of breath, unable to lie down, vexed and restless, with the genitals greatly swollen.

In true heart pain, the hands and feet grow cold up to the joints. If the heart pain is severe, one dies by dawn if it arises in the evening, and by dusk if it arises in the morning.

In heart and abdominal pain, there is vexation and agitation, with swelling and gatherings that move up and down, pain that ceases and recurs, heat in the heart and abdomen, frequent thirst, and drooling—this is due to roundworms biting. Press firmly with the hand to prevent movement, then pierce with a large needle and hold it for a long time. When the worm ceases moving, withdraw the needle. For roundworms biting in the intestines, one must not use a small needle.

In heart distention, there is vexation, shortness of breath, and restless sleep.

When the heart pulse is urgent, it is called heart *shan*. The lower abdomen will have a form, for the heart is the yang viscus, and the small intestine serves it, so the lower abdomen will have a form.

When diagnosing heart accumulation, the pulse is deep and hollow, sometimes ascending and descending without fixed location, with chest fullness and palpitations. There is heat in the abdomen, a red face, dry throat, heart vexation, heat in the palms, and in severe cases, spitting of blood, convulsions of the body, and blood *jue*. It worsens in winter and improves in summer, and the color is red.

The heart’s accumulation is called *Fuliang*. It arises above the navel and ascends to the heart, as large as an arm. If it persists without healing, it causes heart vexation and pain. It is contracted on *geng* or *xin* days in autumn. Why? The kidneys transmit disease to the heart, and the heart should transmit it to the lungs. However, the lungs are in their ascendant phase in autumn and do not receive evil. The heart then attempts to return the disease to the kidneys, but the kidneys refuse to accept it, so it lingers and binds into an accumulation. Thus, *Fuliang* is contracted in autumn.

In heart disease with vexation, oppression, scant *qi*, and great heat, the heat surges upward to scald the heart, causing vomiting, coughing, counterflow, raving speech, and sweating like pearls. The body grows cold in counterflow, and the pulse should be floating, but instead is deep, soft, and slippery. The complexion should be red but is instead black—this is water overwhelming fire, a great counterflow. It is incurable and leads to death in ten cases.

The *zheng* tone corresponds to the sound of the heart. The heart’s sound is laughter, its tone is *yu*, its emotion is joy, and its channel is the Hand *Shaoyin*.

When *jue*-counterflow affects the *Taiyang*, the constructive and defensive *qi* fail to circulate, *yin* and *yang* reverse and clash, *yang* *qi* strikes outward, and *yin* *qi* injures within. Injury leads to cold, cold leads to deficiency, and deficiency leads to fright, tugging, and heart palpitations. *Dingxin Tang* governs this. The formula is found in another volume.

When the voice is relaxed at first but urgent later, the latter sound fails to continue, the beginning is muddled and the end turbid, the mouth is numb and confused, and one laughs readily—this is severe wind entering the heart. *Xingli Tang* governs this. The formula is found in another volume.

When heart deficiency is due to wind-cold, with half the body paralyzed, joints dislocated, flaccidity and weakness, incontinence, and deviation of the mouth and face, *Jiangfu Tang* governs this. The formula is found in another volume. This disease does not last ten days; one should treat it urgently.

When one laughs and groans, groans and then becomes sorrowful—this is water overwhelming fire, *yin* striking *yang*, *yin* rising and *yang* lying low. Low *yang* becomes replete, repletion injures with heat, heat causes madness, oppression, confusion, and delirium, with much erroneous speech that should not be heeded. The heart is already injured. If the person’s lips are a proper red, it is treatable; if they are green, yellow, white, or black, it is untreatable.

When heart disease causes malaria, it makes one extremely heart-vexed, desiring cool water, with more cold and less heat. The formula is found in another volume.

If a person was originally mild and gentle in heart and disposition but suddenly becomes hasty and contrary to their usual nature, *Baimu Jiu* governs this. The formula is found in another volume.

If one’s speech is cut off before finishing, and they pick at their toenails with their hands, this person will surely die. Though misfortune has not yet befallen them, this is called "walking corpse."

These are the signs of heart disease in the voice. When deficient, supplement; when replete, drain. For those who cannot be treated, observe clearly and discern.

Red corresponds to the heart, and the heart governs the vessels. A red complexion like a rooster’s comb is auspicious. The heart governs the tongue, and the tongue is the heart’s surplus.

Those with a fire phase appearance resemble the upper *zheng*: red complexion, broad forehead, a pointed face, small head, well-developed shoulders, back, thighs, and abdomen, small hands and feet, steady gait, brisk walking with swaying shoulders, plump flesh, abundant *qi*, careless with wealth, untrustworthy, given to worry, perceptive in matters, hasty and impatient, short-lived and prone to sudden death. They endure spring and summer but not autumn and winter.

Illness arising from autumn and winter afflictions primarily concerns the hand *Shaoyin* orifices. The [nasal bridge’s] length, shortness, slant, or straightness corresponds to the heart, manifesting as a proper red hue. Those with fine textures have small hearts; small hearts resist harm from pathogenic factors but are easily injured by sorrow. Those with coarse textures have large hearts; large hearts are vacuous, vacuity engenders cold, and cold renders them immune to sorrow’s harm but vulnerable to pathogenic factors.

Those without [a nasal bridge] have elevated hearts; elevation leads to repletion, repletion engenders heat, and heat causes fullness in the lung, leading to oppression and forgetfulness, making speech difficult. Those with a small, short, and raised [nasal bridge] have sunken hearts; a sunken heart exposes the viscera externally, making them prone to cold injury and easily frightened in speech. Those with a long [nasal bridge] have firm hearts; firmness ensures the viscera’s stability and steadfastness. Those with a weak and thin [nasal bridge] have fragile hearts; fragility predisposes them to wasting-thirst and heat in the center.

Those with a straight, downward, and unraised [nasal bridge] have upright hearts; uprightness fosters harmony and resilience, making injury difficult. Those whose [nasal bridge] inclines to one side have hearts that are askew; askewness leads to inconsistency and an inability to maintain governance.

Another account states: If the [nasal bridge] is small, short, thin, weak, and sunken, the heart is sunken; a sunken heart is vacuous, vacuity invites cold injury, and illness arises from sorrow, anger, and internal depletion. The heart suffers sudden pain, accompanied by frequent spitting of clear saliva, foul breath, dental caries, and toothache. If the [nasal bridge] is elevated, the heart is elevated; elevation leads to repletion, repletion engenders heat, and heat causes fullness in the heart, leading to oppression, forgetfulness, fear, palpitations, dry throat, mouth pain, dental abscesses, tongue lesions, and—in children—constipation, thickened tongue coating, thrush, and hoarse voice. The methods for discerning these are found in the chapter on the head and face.

Whenever a person’s facial regions exhibit depressions or protrusions, illness is bound to arise. The *Taiyang* of the Small Intestine governs the heart’s domain; where its regions show depression or protrusion, illness manifests. The viscera encompass both internal and external: the deep and turbid pertain to the interior, while the floating and clear reside externally. If an external illness enters the interior, the lower abdomen becomes full and distended; if an internal illness envelops and emerges, the corresponding region sinks and collapses.

When an external illness enters the interior, first treat the *yang*, then supplement the *yin*; when an internal illness emerges externally, first supplement the *yin*, then drain the *yang*. *Yang* corresponds to repletion and heat, while *yin* corresponds to vacuity and cold. *Yang* governs the exterior, and *yin* governs the interior.

A person’s fortunes in life and death are foretold by the viscera’s spirits, which first transform and manifest externally. When the heart is ailing, the mouth gapes open; if the heart is on the verge of death, the complexion becomes withered and black, and speech fails to articulate. If the *Tianzhong* and other regions show the hue of the tomb, and the corresponding color appears at *Mao*, death is inevitable and untreatable. Observe the correspondences and their waxing or waning, and weigh the timing carefully. If the signs are protracted, death will not occur within four hundred days; if urgent, it will not extend beyond a month or two.

How can one know if a heart ailment has slightly improved yet will suddenly prove fatal? When a dull, dark, speckled hue like a *boqi* piece appears, if it manifests on the forehead, death will occur within the year. When the heart’s *qi* is severed, death follows within a day. How can this be known? When the eyes stare fixedly, the shoulders heave with labored breathing, death is imminent.

Whenever the face is red and the eyes white, yet sorrow, anger, contemplation, and anxiety deplete the heart’s *qi* while the complexion paradoxically appears favorable, one should urgently prepare a coffin, for death will come within ten days. If the face is yellow and the eyes red, the person will not die; but if the red resembles coagulated blood, death is certain.

Auspicious and inauspicious hues, when appearing in their respective regions, if faintly visible, and if a red or black hue enters the mouth, death is inevitable within the year—this is called "the walking corpse." If no corresponding sign appears on the year’s region, illness will prove fatal within three years.

In summer, the fire phase governs the heart’s pulse, which is red and pertains to the hand *Taiyang*. In summer, one treats the flourishing channels and interstices. Summer is when fire begins its governance, the heart’s *qi* begins to grow, the pulse is slender, and *qi* is weak. *Yang* *qi* lingers and overflows, heat steams the interstices, and penetrates internally to the channels. Thus, one treats the flourishing channels and interstices, severing the skin to expel illness—pathogenic factors reside superficially. The so-called flourishing channels are the *yang* vessels.

The root of this vessel lies behind the external malleolus, corresponding to three *cun* above the *Mingmen*. The *Mingmen* is located one *cun* above the heart. The vessel’s root is at *Shaoze*, which is at the tip of the little finger. Its sinews begin above the little finger, bind at the wrist, follow the inner arm’s edge, and bind at the posterior aspect of the elbow’s *dui* bone. When plucked, it resonates at the little finger’s tip, then enters and binds beneath the armpit. Its branch travels posteriorly along the armpit’s edge, ascends to encircle the scapula, follows the neck, emerges anterior to the foot *Taiyang* sinews, and binds at the *Wangu* behind the ear. Another branch enters the ear, emerges directly above it, descends to bind at the jaw, and connects to the outer canthus.

The vessel begins at the little finger’s tip, follows the hand’s outer edge to the wrist, emerges at the styloid process, ascends directly along the arm’s lower edge, exits between the two bones at the elbow’s inner side, follows the outer posterior edge of the upper arm, emerges at the shoulder joint, encircles the scapula, intersects above the shoulder, enters the supraclavicular fossa, and travels toward the armpit to network with the heart. It follows the throat, descends through the diaphragm, reaches the stomach, and pertains to the Small Intestine.

One branch ascends from the supraclavicular fossa along the neck to the cheek, reaches the outer canthus, and enters the ear. Another branch diverges from the cheek, ascends to the infraorbital region, reaches the nose, and extends to the inner canthus, obliquely networking at the zygomatic bone. It pairs with the hand *Shaoyin* as exterior and interior; the *Shaoyin*’s root is at the *dui* bone’s tip, corresponding to the back, and converges with the hand *Taiyin*.

The hand *Taiyang*’s divergence is called *Zhizheng*, which ascends five *cun* above the wrist and internally infuses into the *Shaoyin*. Its branch ascends to the elbow and networks at the shoulder’s *jie*, governing illnesses arising from the heart.

When replete, the Small Intestine suffers heat; heat causes joint laxity, laxity leads to *yang* illness, and the *yang* vessel becomes large. If it counterflows and doubles at the *cunkou*, illness manifests as throat pain, jaw swelling, deafness, yellowed eyes, an inability to lie down or speak, and oppression leading to sudden sitting. When vacuous, the Small Intestine suffers cold; cold generates warts, and warts lead to *yin* illness. If the *yin* vessel becomes smaller than the *cunkou* by more than one degree, illness manifests as shortness of breath, pain in all joints, sinew tension, neck pain, and an inability to turn the head.

All these are illnesses of the hand *Taiyang* Small Intestine’s sinews, vessels, branches, and divergences. Now, the heart’s governing pericardium and the *Shaoyin* heart channel are appended below.

The branch of the Hand *Pericardium Governor* is called *Neiguan*. Five *cun* above the wrist (the *Jiayi* states two *cun*), it emerges between the two sinews, follows the channel upward, strikes the pericardium, and networks the heart system. When *qi* is replete, there is heart pain; when vacuous, there is vexation of the heart. Treat it between the two sinews.

The channel of the Hand *Pericardium Governor* arises in the chest, emerges to belong to the pericardium, descends through the diaphragm, and passes through to network the Triple Burner. Its branch follows the chest, emerges at the flank, descends three *cun* below the axilla, ascends to the axilla, descends along the inner arm, travels between the *Taiyin* and *Shaoyin*, enters the elbow, descends the forearm between the two sinews, enters the center of the palm, and follows the middle finger to its tip. Another branch diverges from the center of the palm, follows the fourth finger to its tip.

When this channel moves, it causes illness: heat in the palm, spasm and tension in the elbow and arm, swelling in the axilla, and in severe cases, fullness and propping distension in the chest and flanks, great stirring in the heart, red face, yellowed eyes, and incessant laughter. The illnesses generated by this channel are vexation of the heart, heart pain, and heat in the center of the palm. For all these illnesses: when replete, drain; when vacuous, supplement; when hot, treat swiftly; when cold, retain the needle; when sunken and depleted, apply moxibustion. When neither replete nor vacuous, treat according to the channel. When replete, the *cunkou* pulse is twice as large as the *renying*; when vacuous, the *cunkou* is smaller than the *renying*.

The branch of the Hand *Shaoyin* is called *Tongli*. One *cun* behind the wrist, it diverges and ascends, follows the channel into the throat, connects to the root of the tongue, and belongs to the eye system. When replete, there is propping fullness in the diaphragm; when vacuous, there is an inability to speak. Treat it one *cun* behind the palm, where it diverges to the *Taiyang*.

The channel of the Hand *Shaoyin* arises in the heart, emerges to belong to the heart system, ascends through the diaphragm, and networks the Small Intestine. Its branch follows the heart system upward alongside the throat and connects to the eye system. (Another version states: follows the chest and emerges at the flank.) Its straight portion again follows the heart system upward to the lung, emerges below the axilla, descends along the posterior inner arm, travels behind the *Taiyin* and *Pericardium Governor*, descends to the inner elbow, follows the posterior inner forearm, reaches the styloid process at the back of the palm, enters the inner posterior palm, follows the inner side of the little finger to its tip.

When this channel moves, it causes illness: dry throat, heart pain, thirst with desire to drink—this is called *arm reversal*. The illnesses generated by the heart are yellowed eyes, fullness and pain in the flanks, pain and reversal in the posterior inner arm, and heat and pain in the center of the palm. For all these illnesses: when replete, drain; when vacuous, supplement. When replete, the *cunkou* pulse is twice as large as the *renying*; when vacuous, the *cunkou* is smaller than the *renying*.

Why does the Hand *Shaoyin* channel alone have no *shu*-points? It is said: The *Shaoyin* is the heart channel. The heart is the great ruler of the five viscera and six bowels, the emperor, the abode of spirit and essence. Its viscus is firm and secure; evil cannot lodge there. If evil lodges there, the heart is harmed; if the heart is harmed, spirit departs; if spirit departs, the body dies. Thus, all evils in the heart are in the heart’s pericardium. The pericardium is the channel of the *Pericardium Governor*. Therefore, the *Shaoyin* has no *shu*-points.

If the *Shaoyin* has no *shu*-points, does the heart not suffer illness? It is said: When the external channel or bowel is ill, the viscus is not ill. Thus, treat only its channel at the styloid process behind the palm.

In the third month of summer, the heart and Small Intestine govern. Red vessel illnesses arise when the *qi* of *Shaoyin* and *Taiyang* contend and stagnate, causing construction and defense to fail to flow, and pain to arise in the skin and flesh. When the *Taiyang* stirs and the *Shaoyin* moves, excessive evil *qi* arises, and the viscera and bowels receive seasonal epidemic illnesses accordingly, with their illnesses opposing one another. If the bowel is vacuous and harmed by *yin* evil *qi*, the body trembles and the pulse quivers, and one cannot grasp objects. If the viscus is replete and invaded by *yang* toxin, the flesh is hot, the mouth opens, the tongue splits, the throat is blocked, and the voice is hoarse—this is called *red vessel illness*. The formula is found in the *Cold Damage* scroll.

Bian Que said: Moxibustion on the *shu*-points of the kidney, liver, and heart governs the treatment of cinnabar toxin (or *bi* toxin). One should treat according to the source, regulate *yin* and *yang* at the exterior, harmonize the viscera and bowels, and illness will not arise.

**Discourse on Heart Taxation, Third**
**Formulas**

The discourse states: In heart taxation disease, supplement the spleen *qi* to benefit it. When the spleen is effulgent, it will resonate with the heart.

If one goes against summer *qi*, the hand greater yang will fail to grow, and heart *qi* will internally become hollow. Following it brings life; opposing it brings death. Following it brings order; opposing it brings chaos. Reversing compliance into opposition is called block and repulsion, and disease arises.

**Pulse and Diagnosis:**
The pulse is *xian* (wiry) and *ku* (bitter). When examining, if the pulse is large and replete, it indicates the qi is not settled, and heat is present. The viscera and bowels, both internal and external, are affected. If the pulse at *mao* (5–7 a.m.) is victorious, it is like a game of *boqi* (a board game); if it follows the sequence, it is favorable. If the liver pulse is replete, the small intestine is affected; if the heart pulse is replete, the lung is affected.

**Sun Zhenren’s *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold*, Scroll Forty-One, End**

**Heart Zang Prescriptions**
*Pulse Extremities, Fourth Discourse – Formulas and Moxibustion Methods*

The discourse states: All cases of pulse extremity pertain to the heart. The heart corresponds to the pulse, and pulse and heart are conjoined; thus, when the heart is afflicted, illness arises from the pulse.

It is further said: When illness is encountered in summer, it is termed *pulse impediment*. If pulse impediment persists and is again assailed by pathogenic influence, it lodges internally in the heart, resulting in food failing to nourish the muscles and skin, coughing with blood loss, a pallid and lustreless complexion, and a hollow, vacuous pulse. The lips manifest a reddish hue.

Whenever pulse qi declines, the blood desiccates and hair falls out. If contracted on a *bing* or *ding* day in summer due to wind damage to the pulse, it is termed *heart wind*. The symptoms of heart wind include profuse sweating and aversion to wind. If the pulse qi is replete, heat arises; heat injures the heart, causing irritability, a reddish facial hue, and in severe cases, sluggish speech. With blood depletion, the complexion becomes parched and lustreless, and food fails to nourish the muscles and skin. If the pulse qi is vacuous, cold arises; cold induces cough, cough induces heart pain, and the throat feels obstructed as if choked. In severe cases, the throat swells and becomes impeded. Thus, it is called heart wind—a condition of vacuity and repletion.

When the yang channel pulse is afflicted, treat the yin network vessels; when the yin network vessels are afflicted, treat the yang channel. Stabilize the blood and qi, each guarding its domain. For replete pulses, draining is appropriate; for qi vacuity, supplementation is suitable.

The skilled physician stabilizes vacuity and repletion and treats accordingly to achieve cure. If the illness resides in the skin, hair, muscles, flesh, sinews, or vessels, complete recovery is possible. If it reaches the six bowels or five viscera, half are doomed to die.

Bian Que stated: If the pulse is cut off, the patient will die within three days. How is this known? When pulse qi is hollow and vacuous, the complexion withers and hair falls out. The pulse corresponds to the hand *shaoyin*; when hand *shaoyin* qi is cut off, the pulse ceases to flow, and the blood dies first.

**Fresh Rehmannia Decoction**
*Treats pulse heat extremity with blood and qi depletion, a pallid and parched complexion lacking lustre, and food failing to nourish the muscles and skin. Clears heat, checks extremity, and fortifies stomach qi.*

- 1 *sheng* each of fresh rehmannia juice, fresh ophiopogon, and red honey
- 1 *sheng* of water shield (or fermented soybean, variant)
- 2 *sheng* of polygala root
- 2 *liang* of licorice root
- 3 *liang* each of ginseng, poria, dried rehmannia, peony, and atractylodes
- 6 *liang* of gypsum
- 4 *liang* of fresh Solomon’s seal

Eleven ingredients in total. Chop the eleven ingredients, boil in 1 *dou* 2 *sheng* of water to obtain 2 *sheng* 7 *ge*, discard the dregs, add rehmannia juice and honey, and decoct further to obtain 3 *sheng* 5 *ge*. Divide into four doses.

**Moxibustion Methods**
For chest pain radiating to the waist and back, with retching and counterflow, and a complexion lacking moisture, moxa *Shangmen* (Upper Gate) with cones corresponding to the patient’s age. The point lies beside *Juque* (Great Tower Gate), half a *cun* (or one *cun*, variant) on either side.

For a withered, parched complexion, taxation qi, and essence loss, with shoulder and arm pain preventing elevation to the head, moxa *Jianyu* (Shoulder Bone) with one hundred cones. The point lies at the outer head of the shoulder, near the rear; when pressed, a depression is felt.

**Pulse Vacuity and Repletion, Fifth Discourse – Formulas and Acupuncture-Moxibustion Methods**

The discourse states: All cases of pulse vacuity manifest as frequent startling and restlessness; pulse repletion manifests as surging fullness.

The correspondence of pulse vacuity and repletion pertains to the heart and small intestine. If the bowels or viscera are afflicted, heat generates illness corresponding to the viscera, while cold corresponds to the bowels.

**Ledebouriella Pill**

**Heart and Abdominal Pain, Sixth Discourse – Formulas, Steaming-Fomentation, and Moxibustion Methods**

The discourse states: When cold qi suddenly invades the five viscera and six bowels, it causes sudden heart pain and chest impediment. If the cold is mild, it induces cough; if severe, it causes pain and diarrhea.

*Reversal heart pain* drawing the back, with frequent convulsions, as if an object strikes the heart from behind, and the body stoops—this is *kidney heart pain*.

*Reversal heart pain* with abdominal distention and fullness, and severe heart pain—this is *stomach heart pain*.

*Reversal heart pain* as if a needle or awl pierces the heart, with severe heart pain—this is *spleen heart pain*.

*Reversal heart pain* with a pallid, ashen complexion like death, and inability to sigh deeply all day—this is *liver heart pain*.

*Reversal heart pain* where lying down causes pain from within the heart, and movement exacerbates the pain, with no change in complexion—this is *lung heart pain*.

*True heart pain* causes cold in the hands and feet extending to the joints, with severe heart pain. If it arises in the morning, death comes by evening; if it arises in the evening, death comes by morning.

*Roundworm heart pain* manifests as pain in the heart and abdomen, with intermittent swelling and gatherings that move up and down, pain with remissions, internal heat, and profuse drooling—this is roundworm biting.

Press firmly with the hand and hold steadfastly to prevent movement, then pierce with a large needle and hold it there for a long time. When the worm ceases to move, withdraw the needle.

The area beneath the heart must not be needled. Where there is a formed accumulation, the *shu*-points must not be selected.

For roundworms biting within the intestines, none may be treated with small needles.

**Chapter Seven: Chest Impediment (Xiōng Bì) – Formulas and Moxibustion Methods**

The *Discourse* states: Chest impediment causes firm fullness and urgent pain in the heart, with numbness and gripping pain in the muscles like stabbing, preventing bending or stretching. The skin over the chest is painful to the touch, the chest feels oppressed and full, breath is short, coughing and spitting induce pain, the throat is obstructed and uncomfortable, with itching sensations, dryness in the throat, occasional nausea, vexation, and copious sweating. In some cases, pain radiates to the back. If left untreated, it may prove fatal within days.

Now, *yáng* deficiency indicates the condition is in the upper burner, and chest impediment with heart pain arises because the patient’s pulse is wiry in *yīn*. In healthy individuals without chills or fever, shortness of breath indicates repletion.

**Formulas for the Small Intestine Repository**
**Discourse on the Small Intestine Repository’s Conduits (Chapter One)**

The discourse states: The small intestine repository governs the heart, and the tongue serves as its indicator. The heart is paired with the small intestine, which is the *receiving and containing* repository, known as the *supervisor of the granary*. It weighs two *jin* and fourteen *liang*, measures two *zhang* and four *chi* in length, and spans two *cun* and four *fen* in breadth. The *Classic of Difficult Issues* and *The Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion* record its length as three *zhang* and two *chi*, its breadth as two *cun* and a half, and its diameter as eight *fen* plus a minor third.

Attached to the spine posteriorly, it coils leftward in overlapping folds. Where it pours into the *returning intestine*, it adheres externally above the navel, revolving in sixteen convolutions. It typically retains two *dou* and four *sheng* of water and grain—one *dou* and two *sheng* being water, and one *dou* and two *sheng* being grain—corresponding to the twenty-four qi. The *Classic of Difficult Issues* states it has sixteen convolutions, holding two *dou* and four *sheng* of grain and six *sheng* plus three *ge* and a major half of water. *The Systematic Classic* records its capacity as three *dou* and three *ge* plus a major half.

The thickness of the lips and the length of the philtrum indicate the condition of the small intestine.

**Small Intestine Disorders**
When the small intestine is afflicted, there is pain in the lower abdomen, the lumbar spine and testicles ache, and one experiences urgency. Heat may also manifest before the ears. In cases of extreme cold, heat arises solely on the shoulders and between the little finger and its adjacent finger. If the pulse is slippery—*The Pulse Classic* renders this as "sunken," and *The Systematic Classic* concurs—this is its sign.

When the lower abdomen tugs at the testicles, drawing pain up the lumbar spine to the heart, and the pathogen resides in the small intestine, it connects to the spermatic cord, attaches to the spine, penetrates the liver and lungs, and binds the heart’s network. When qi flourishes, it surges upward in counterflow, disturbing the intestines and stomach, agitating the liver and lungs, dispersing into the *huang*, and congealing at the navel. Thus, one disperses it by needling the *huang* origin, harmonizes it by needling the *Greater Yin*, drains it by needling the *Terminal Yin*, and expels it by needling the *Lower Ridge of the Great Hollow*. Regulate it by pressing the conduits it traverses.

If the *yang* pulse at the *cun* position before the *guan* on the left hand is absent, the small intestine’s pulse is absent. The patient suffers from navel blockage, *shan* and *jia* masses in the lower abdomen, and in the *king month*, cold ascends to assail the heart. Needle the *Hand Reverting Yin* to treat the *yin*; the *Hand Reverting Yin* is located one *fen* deep in the transverse crease on the palm’s posterior side.

If the *yang* pulse at the *cun* position before the *guan* on the left hand is replete, the small intestine is replete. The patient suffers from urgency below the heart, heat blockage, internal heat in the small intestine, and reddish-yellow urine. Needle the *Hand Greater Yang* to treat the *yang*; the *Hand Greater Yang* is located in the depression at the base of the little finger’s outer side.

When the small intestine has cold, the patient experiences heaviness in the lower body and passes pus and blood in the stool. When it has heat, hemorrhoids necessarily arise. When the small intestine harbors retained food, fever regularly arises at dusk and subsides by dawn.

When the small intestine is distended, the lower abdomen swells and protrudes, drawing pain into the abdomen. When the heart first contracts an illness and transmits it to the small intestine, and the heart’s cough persists, qi and cough emerge together.

When counterflow qi lodges in the small intestine, one dreams of gathering in city streets and thoroughfares.

The heart corresponds to the skin. Where the skin is thick, the vessels are thick, and where the vessels are thick, the small intestine is thick. Where the skin is thin, the vessels are thin, and where the vessels are thin, the small intestine is thin. Where the skin is slack, the vessels are slack, and where the vessels are slack, the small intestine is large and long. Where the skin is thin and the vessels are faint and small, the small intestine is small and short. When all the *yang* conduits are excessively tortuous, the small intestine is knotted.

Bian Que stated: The *Hand Lesser Yin* and *Greater Yang* form an exterior-interior pair. Thus, the exterior is clear and the interior turbid; clarity is replete while turbidity is vacuous. Therefore, when food descends, the intestines are replete while the stomach is vacuous, making the repository replete yet not full. When replete, it is harmed by heat, and with heat, the mouth gapes and sores arise. When vacuous, it is harmed by cold, and with cold, one passes pus and blood in the stool or develops *wrapping water*, its root lying in the small intestine, first arising from the abdomen. The formula is found in the *Treatise on Water* section.

When the small intestine is cut off, it is incurable, and death follows in six days. How does one know this? The hair stands stiff as dry hemp, unable to bend or stretch, and incessant white sweating occurs.

**The Conduit of the Hand Greater Yang**
When it moves, there is pain in the throat, swelling in the jaw, and inability to turn the head. The shoulder feels as if pulled, and the upper arm feels as if broken. It governs the fluids and gives rise to diseases such as deafness, yellowed eyes, swollen cheeks and jaw, and pain along the posterior outer edge of the neck, shoulder, upper arm, elbow, and forearm. The branches and offshoots of the conduit are already recorded in the *Heart Viscus* section.

**Vacuity and Repletion of the Small Intestine (Chapter Two)**
**Pulse and Formulae / Moxibustion**

**Small Intestine Repletion Heat**
When the *yang* pulse before the *renying* at the *cun* position of the left hand is replete, it pertains to the *Hand Greater Yang* conduit. The patient suffers from body heat that comes and goes without sweating, vexation and fullness in the heart, heaviness in the body, and sores in the mouth. This is called *small intestine repletion heat*.

*Bupleurum and Alisma Decoction* treats small intestine heat distension and mouth sores:
Bupleurum, alisma, tangerine peel (substitute with platycodon), scutellaria, inula flower, unripe bitter orange, cimicifuga, and mirabilite—two *liang* each; fresh rehmannia (sliced)—one *sheng*.
Steep the nine ingredients, boil in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and divide into three doses.

*Rhubarb Pill* treats small intestine heat binding and fullness with obstruction:
Rhubarb, peony—two *liang* each; tingli seed, kansui—three *liang* each; apricot kernels—fifty pieces; croton seeds—seven pieces.
Grind the seven ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of parasol seeds. Adults take seven pills with water; children take two or three pills, twice daily. Once heat subsides, take once daily.

**Moxibustion**
For small intestine heat fullness, moxa the *Yin Metropolis* with cones corresponding to the patient’s age. The point lies one *cun* lateral to the midline beside the *Middle Conduit*.

For small intestine diarrhea with pus and blood, moxa the *Hun Meeting* with one hundred cones; reduce the number for children. The point lies one *cun* lateral to the navel on each side. *The Wings* states it is one *cun* distant. Alternatively, moxa the *Small Intestine Transport* with seven cones.

**Small Intestine Vacuity Cold**
When the *yang* pulse before the *renying* at the *cun* position of the left hand is vacuous, it pertains to the *Hand Greater Yang* conduit. The patient suffers from unilateral headache at the skull’s edge and pain in the ears and cheeks. This is called *small intestine vacuity cold*.

**Formula to Supplement Small Intestine Vacuity Cold**
For pain due to small intestine vacuity cold, passing red and white stool, intestinal slippage, and anguish in the intestines, use the following supplementing formula:

**Supplementing Formula for Small Intestine Vacuity Cold**
Dried ginger, three *liang*; Chinese angelica, *phellodendron*, and *diyu*, each four *liang*; coptis, ass-hide glue, each two *liang*; pomegranate rind, three pieces. The seven ingredients are cut and decocted in seven *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng* and five *ge*. Strain the dregs, add the glue, and simmer until fully dissolved. Divide into three doses for daily consumption.

**Chapter Three: On the Tongue**
The tongue serves as the indicator of the heart and small intestine. Weighing ten *liang*, it measures seven *cun* in length and two and a half *cun* in breadth. It excels in balancing flavors and regulating the five tastes.

When consuming foods:
- Excessive salt causes the tongue’s vessels to congeal and its color to alter.
- Excessive bitterness desiccates the tongue’s surface, causing the outer hairs to wither.
- Excessive acridity tightens the tongue and dries the nails.
- Excessive sourness fattens the tongue’s flesh and curls the lips.
- Excessive sweetness induces pain at the tongue’s root and hair loss.

It is further said: The heart desires bitterness, the lungs acridity, the liver sourness, the spleen sweetness, and the kidneys saltiness—these five flavors internally harmonize with the *qi* of the five viscera.

If the viscera are hot, the tongue develops sores, drawing the lips upward and reddening them. If the bowels are cold, the tongue’s root retracts, the mouth clenches, and the lips turn blue-green. Cold requires supplementation; heat requires drainage. When neither cold nor heat is present, regulate according to the viscera and bowels.

For retracted tongue, clenched mouth, and blue-green lips, the *Shengma Decoction* governs. The formula appears in another volume.

**Chapter Four: Wind Dizziness**
**Preface, Discussion, Formulas, and Moxibustion Prohibitions**
Since the previous volume already contains formulas for wind affecting the head and face, wind dizziness should not be separately categorized. However, Sun Simiao deemed these methods to be Xu Sibai’s formulas, which ought not be mingled with others. Thus, this section is established specifically for wind dizziness, exclusively presenting Xu’s formulas.

Xu Sibai states: From youth, I inherited my family’s medical tradition and became well-versed in classical formulas. I have studied the essential treatments of renowned physicians. While wind dizziness arises through many pathways, and no single method guarantees efficacy, this technique has been my particular focus. Since my early years, I have applied it without fail. Now, nearing old age, I fear my time is short, so I clearly expound these patterns and theories to bequeath them to later generations.

Wind dizziness arises from unsettled heart *qi* and stagnation in the chest, manifesting as high wind and flushed face. Phlegm-heat stirs wind, and wind disturbs the heart, causing confusion and dizziness—hence the name *wind dizziness*. In adults, it is called *epilepsy*; in children, *convulsions*—though the condition is fundamentally the same.

This formula cures without exception, provided the pattern is carefully assessed. Misjudgment may lead to errors. Generally, avoid the ten rich meats. If *running piglet* disorder arises, frequent attacks with rapid breathing may prove fatal and irreversible. Thus, this decoction balances severity and mildness—do not dismiss it as unsuitable for the condition.

Formulas for wind dizziness include decoctions, powders, pills, and syrups, totaling ten. At the onset, administer the *Continuing Life Decoction* immediately. In urgent cases, locate the moxibustion points and apply fire needling—none will fail to recover. Needling followed by moxibustion is most effective. The moxibustion method is listed below.

In over thirty years of practice, I have saved hundreds, all of whom recovered. May later practitioners master this formula and refrain from adulterating it with other methods.

**Continuing Life Decoction** (*Xuming Tang*), for wind dizziness with vexation, stupor, foaming at the mouth, opisthotonos, upward-staring eyes, and clenched jaw with inability to speak:
- Bamboo sap: 1 sheng and 2 ge
- Fresh rehmannia juice: 1 sheng

Grind the ten ingredients, decoct in 1 *dou* of water, and reduce to 3 *sheng*. Divide into three doses.
*For cases with qi [deficiency], increase aconite to 1 liang, add perilla seed (5 *ge*) and tangerine peel (½ liang).*

After administering the *Continuing Life Decoction*, if the mouth opens but the limbs remain unsettled and the mind is still disturbed, the **Purple Stone Decoction** governs it. *(The formula is found later under* Purple Stone Boiled Umbrella*.)*

**Running Piglet Decoction**, for qi surging violently to the point of collapse:
- Evodia fruit: 1 sheng
- Gypsum: 4 fen
- Ginseng: 4 fen
- Pinellia: 4 fen
- Ligusticum: 4 fen
- Peony: 4 fen
- Fresh ginger: 4 fen
- Fresh kudzu root: 10 fen
- Poria: 10 fen
- Tangkuei: 4 liang
- Plum root bark: 1 *jin*

Grind the twelve ingredients, decoct in 7 *sheng* of water and 8 *sheng* of clear wine, and reduce to 3 *sheng*. Divide into three doses.

**Stephania-Rehmannia Decoction**, for incoherent speech, darting eyes, talk of seeing ghosts, or deranged spirit:
- Stephania root: 2 liang
- Licorice: 2 liang
- Cinnamon bark: 3 liang
- Ledebouriella root: 3 liang
- Fresh rehmannia: 5 *jin* (cut separately; do not soak with the other herbs; for mild cases, use 2 *jin*)

Grind the five ingredients, soak in 1 *sheng* of water overnight, then press to extract the juice. Place the dregs on a bamboo mat, layer the rehmannia over them, and steam beneath 5 *dou* of rice. Collect the liquid in a copper vessel. When the rice is cooked, combine it with the previously extracted juice, press again, and divide into two doses.

**Dioscorea Decoction**, for palpitations with flaccid limbs, heat in the head and face, phlegm-fullness in the chest, and dizziness as if the head and eyes are swaying:
- Dioscorea: 4 liang
- Ophiopogon: 4 liang
- Ginseng: 4 liang
- Fresh rehmannia: 8 fen
- Peucedanum: 8 fen
- Peony: 8 fen

- Fresh ginger: 3 fen
- Poria: 6 fen
- Poria spirit: 6 fen
- Pinellia: 5 fen
- Licorice: 2 fen
- Scutellaria: 2 fen
- Bamboo leaf: 2 fen
- Glutinous rice: 3 *ge*

Grind the sixteen ingredients, take river water, and raise it high to agitate 390 times. Measure 3 *dou*, boil the rice, reduce by 1 *dou*, add pinellia, and reduce by another 9 *sheng*. Remove the dregs, add the remaining herbs, and decoct to 4 *sheng*. Divide into four doses.
*Where river water is unavailable, substitute water from a thousand *li* eastward. In Qin, Jing and Wei River water may be used. For* Zhuge’s Irrigation Channel*, take water from the upper reaches.*

**Ledebouriella Decoction**, for cases where, after the previous decoctions, the limbs remain uncooled and dizziness persists. This decoction is highly effective and may be taken long-term, with minor adjustments for cold or warmth. If the condition does not resolve, follow this formula:
- Ledebouriella root: 3 fen
- Gypsum: 3 fen
- Ginseng: 3 fen
- Red halloysite: 3 fen
- White halloysite: 3 fen
- Fresh ginger: 3 fen
- Dragon bone: 3 fen
- Calcite: 3 fen
- Poria: 3 fen
- Cinnamon bark: 2 fen
- Purple stone: 1 fen

Grind the eleven ingredients, decoct in 8 *sheng* of water, and reduce to 3 *sheng*. Divide into three doses.
*When using well-flower water, select the clearest portion.*

Here the Yangtze River water is used, for it carries no mud nor any grit or filth. The source springs travel far, following the current to the sea, never reversing upstream—thus when employed to treat the head, it must descend downward.

**Yam Decoction Formula:**
- Yam: 24 fen

- Mixed deer and stag marrow: 8 *liang*
- Deerhorn glue: 8 *liang*
- Jujubes: 80 pieces
- Hemp seeds (ground): 3 *sheng*
- Honey: 3 *sheng*
- Mulberry root bark: 5 *sheng* (avoid bark from trees growing on ridges, which is highly toxic; also avoid bark from near fences, walls, or ditches—none of these may be used)

Steep the twenty-seven ingredients in 2 *dou* 4 *sheng* of clear wine. Decoct the mulberry bark, hemp seeds, and jujubes until 1 *dou* remains, then strain. Add the rehmannia juice, glue, marrow, and honey, decocting until reduced by half. Incorporate the previously ground powders and continue decocting until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk. Take one pill three times daily, gradually increasing to three pills.

- Atractylodes: 6 fen
- Polygala: 6 fen
- Yam: 6 fen
- Poria spirit: 6 fen
- Cornus: 6 fen

Grind the thirteen ingredients and sift. Take one square *cun* spoonful before meals with chrysanthemum wine, twice daily, gradually increasing to three spoonfuls until the desired effect is achieved.

**Chrysanthemum Wine Method:** On the ninth day of the ninth month, gather sweet chrysanthemum flowers from Dengzhou, dry them in the sun, and grind into powder. Steam with rice to make wine.

**Ginseng Pill**, for treating intermittent mental confusion:

Grind the eleven ingredients into powder and form into honey pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take seven pills with the aforementioned chrysanthemum wine, three times daily and once at night, gradually increasing the dose.

When compounding medicines, do not use blue paper. Avoid encounters with women, those in blue clothing, mourners, the incomplete, the unclean, or the impure, as well as livestock, chickens, rats, and the like.

**Moxibustion Method:**
Measure the width of the mouth with a string, then use the same string to measure the width of the nose between the nostrils. Fold the string in half at the midpoint of the nose measurement, then fold it again at the midpoint of the full mouth measurement. Locate the indentation in the hairline on the head and apply moxibustion there. Use the string to mark the four directions—left, right, front, and back—and apply moxibustion at the string’s endpoints, aligning the front with the face. The number of cones corresponds to the patient’s age, with three treatments per year. Each treatment should only proceed once the previous moxibustion sores have healed, using the same number of cones as before.

If consecutive moxibustion causes fire *qi* to rise upward, and the hairline indentations are multiple, apply moxibustion near the nose. If the indentation is closer to the forehead, moxibustion is also appropriate. If scarring the face is a concern, omit the facial points—though in severe cases, this consideration may be disregarded.

**Dietary Prohibitions:**
Avoid the meat of tigers, rabbits, dragons, snakes, oxen, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, monkeys, and rats. The twelve zodiac-associated meats must not be consumed, nor used in medicinal preparations. However, bezoar and dragon bones/teeth may still be used.

**Textual Variants:**
Variant characters from the Song Dynasty block-print edition are noted as follows: #2 "Wang" (王) appears as "Zhu" (主); #3 "person" (人) was originally "heart" (心); #4 "three liang each" (各三两) appears as "two liang each" (各二两); #5 "ten fen each" (各十分) appears as "six fen each" (各六分); #6 "two fen each" (各二分) appears as "one fen each" (各一分); #7 "thirteen ingredients" (右十三味) was originally "nineteen ingredients" (右十九味); #8 "one piece each" (各一枚) was omitted in the original and has been restored. #9 Below "must not be discarded" (用不可废), the Song edition includes the following passage:

*"Sibu Qi states: How could Sibu claim efficacy in prescriptions and techniques? Yet for wind-dizziness, which I hold most dear—even slight relief from suffering—I have long treasured and guarded these methods, vowing never to reveal them. When compelled to treat such cases, I do not disclose the full method. For all afflicted by this malady, none treated by Sibu have failed to recover. If one dies of this illness, it is only because they did not encounter Sibu. I humbly beseech inquiry among others to confirm this is no boast of mine. Since Your Highness requires this prescription, I respectfully seal and present it. Sibu’s humble resolve remains steadfast. Written in my own hand, though age has dimmed my eyes, and many characters are poorly formed—I beg your indulgence. Respectfully submitted."*

**Fifth Discourse on Wind-Epilepsy: Formulas and Acupuncture-Moxibustion Methods**

**Discourse on Wind-Epilepsy**

The Yellow Emperor asked: "When a person is born with epilepsy, how does this affliction arise?"
Qibo replied: "This arises when, while still in the womb, the mother experiences frequent great fright. The qi surges upward and fails to descend, causing essence and qi to congeal together, thus leading the child to develop epilepsy.

When the disease resides in the yang channels, the patient alternates between cold and heat. When all the interstices alternate between cold and heat, it is called *kuang* (mania). One should needle the deficient channels and observe the interstices until the heat abates before ceasing.

At the onset of epilepsy, if the disease strikes once a year and is left untreated, it will recur monthly. If still untreated, it will strike every four or five days—this is called *dianji* (epilepsy). Needle all the interstices; if the pulse is particularly cold, supplement with the needle until the disease subsides.

When epilepsy first arises, the patient initially feels dispirited, the head grows heavy, the gaze becomes fixed, and the eyes redden. Once the episode reaches its peak, the heart becomes vexed. Observe the complexion and treat by bleeding the hand Taiyang, Yangming, and Taiyin channels.

When epilepsy first arises and the patient instead stiffens, causing spinal pain, observe and bleed the foot Taiyang, Yangming, Taiyin, and hand Taiyang channels.

When epilepsy first manifests with drawn mouth, wailing, and panting (or palpitations as in *Jia Yi Jing*), observe the hand Yangming and Taiyang channels. If the right side is rigid, attack the left; if the left is rigid, attack the right. Cease once the blood changes.

In treating epilepsy, one should remain constantly with the patient, examining the appropriate points to needle. When the disease strikes, observe for any excess and immediately drain it, placing the blood in a gourd vessel. At the time of the next episode, if the blood stirs on its own, the disease is not yet cured; if it does not stir, apply twenty cones of moxa to *qionggu* (the coccyx).

*Qionggu* refers to the tailbone.

In *bone epilepsy*, the jaw, teeth, all transport points, and interstices become swollen, the bones stiffen and straighten, sweat breaks out, and the patient feels vexed and stifled, with frequent vomiting of drool and foam, and qi descending in leakage—this is incurable.

In *sinew epilepsy*, the body curls and contracts, the pulse is large. Needle the root of the *zhuyu* (the great channel of the nape). Frequent vomiting of drool and foam, with qi descending in leakage—this is incurable.

In *vessel epilepsy*, the patient suddenly collapses, the vessels of the four limbs all swell and follow the course of fullness. Bleed all the full vessels. If they are not full, apply moxa to the Taiyang channel beside the nape, and also to the *dai mai* (Belt Vessel) at the waist, three *cun* apart from the interstices, muscles, roots, and transport points. Frequent vomiting of drool and foam, with qi descending in leakage—this is incurable.

When treating epilepsy, if during an episode the patient raves like a madman and the facial skin appears thick and dull, this is fatal and incurable.

Generally, when epilepsy strikes, the patient falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, and loses awareness. If forcibly lifted, they may appear manic, and if they lose control of their bowels, the condition is difficult to cure.

If the pulse in epilepsy is bounding, large, and slippery, the disease will resolve on its own over time. If the pulse is deep, small, urgent, and replete, it is fatal and incurable. A pulse that is small, taut, and urgent is also untreatable. If deficient, it may be cured; if replete, it is fatal.

*Jue* (reversal) can develop into epilepsy. It arises from disharmony in the five *zang* and obstruction in the six *fu*.

*Jue* can become epilepsy, which is why *jue* is appended to this discourse.

When yang declines, heat *jue* arises; when yin declines, cold *jue* arises.

The Yellow Emperor asked: "What causes the cold and heat in *jue*?"
Qibo replied: "When yang qi declines below, it becomes cold *jue*; when yin qi declines below, it becomes heat *jue*."

The Emperor asked: "Why does heat *jue* invariably begin in the soles of the feet?"
Qibo replied: "Yang qi arises on the exterior of the five toes, gathers in the soles, and accumulates in the centers of the feet. Thus, when yang prevails, the soles become hot."

The Emperor asked: "Why does cold *jue* invariably begin in the five toes and ascend to the knees?"
Qibo replied: "Yin qi arises on the interior of the five toes, gathers at the knees, and accumulates above the knees. Thus, when yin qi prevails, cold ascends from the five toes to above the knees. This cold does not come from without but arises from within."

*Jue* may cause abdominal fullness, or it may cause sudden loss of awareness. Some patients remain unconscious for half a day, or even as long as a full day, before regaining awareness. Why is this?
When yin qi is exuberant above, the lower body becomes deficient. Lower deficiency leads to abdominal fullness, and fullness causes the lower qi to press upward, disrupting the proper flow of qi. When qi is disrupted, yang qi becomes chaotic, and chaos leads to loss of awareness.

In *Taiyang jue*, the head swells and feels heavy, and the feet cannot walk, leading to sudden collapse.

In *Yangming jue*, the patient raves, runs about, and shouts, the abdomen is full and prevents lying down, the face is red and hot, and they see and speak delusions.

In *Shaoyang jue*, there is sudden deafness, cheek swelling and heat, rib-side pain, and inability to move the thighs.

In *Taiyin jue*, the abdomen is full and distended, with constipation, loss of appetite, vomiting upon eating, and inability to lie down.

In *Shaoyin jue*, the tongue is dry, urine is red, the abdomen is full, and the heart aches.

In *Jueyin jue*, the lower abdomen swells and pains, the abdomen is distended, urination and defecation are obstructed, the patient prefers to lie with knees drawn up, the genitals retract and swell, and the inner thighs (or outer thighs) are hot.

When excess prevails, drain it; when deficiency prevails, supplement it. When neither excess nor deficiency prevails, treat according to the channel.

For upper cold and lower heat, first needle the Taiyang channel at the nape, retaining the needle for a long time. Then apply a heated iron to the nape and shoulder blades until the heat descends and the cold below ceases. This is called "pushing upward."

For upper heat and lower cold, observe the deficient channels where the vessels sink into the network vessels, and treat them until the qi descends. This is called "drawing downward."

When needling heat *jue*, retain the needle to induce cold; when needling cold *jue*, retain the needle to induce heat.

For heat *jue*, use two yin and one yang; for cold *jue*, use two yang and one yin.
"Two yin" means needling yin twice; "two yang" means needling yang twice.

Heat entering the kidneys in *wenbing* (warm disease) can also cause *jing* (convulsions). In children, epilepsy with exuberant heat can also cause *jing*.

All conditions such as wind-induced aphonia, sudden corpse-like *jue*, and ghostly nightmares that cause unconsciousness resemble one another. One must examine them carefully. Thus, the classics state that prolonged *jue* leads to epilepsy, which is how we know their similarity.

Epilepsy has five types:
The first is *yang epilepsy*. When it strikes, the patient appears dead, loses control of urination, and after a while recovers.

The second is *yin epilepsy*. It arises when, in early infancy, the umbilical wound has not yet healed, and frequent bathing leads to this condition.

The third is *wind epilepsy*. When it strikes, the patient’s eyes are drawn upward, the body convulses with spasms, and they emit a sheep-like cry. After about the time it takes to eat a meal, the episode subsides. It is caused by exertion while sweating in the wind, excessive sexual activity, or overindulgence in alcohol and food before intercourse, which forces the heart *qi* into distress, resulting in shortness of breath and palpitations.

The fourth is *damp epilepsy*. The patient suffers from pain at the brows and heaviness of the body. It is caused by washing the hair while overheated, allowing dampness to congeal in the brain before the sweat has ceased.

The fifth is *horse epilepsy*. When it strikes, the patient’s eyes roll back, the mouth clenches, the limbs contract, and the entire body becomes hot. It is caused by an imbalance of brain heat due to fatty *qi* in infancy.

Rhubarb, dragon bone, and dried ginger—each four *liang*.
Grind the twelve ingredients, sift into coarse powder, and store in a leather pouch suspended in a cool, high place. To use, take a three-finger pinch, boil in three *sheng* of freshly drawn well water, and reduce to one *sheng* and two *ge*. Adults take the full dose at once; infants under one hundred days take one *ge*, and those unable to swallow may have it applied to the mouth with silk. For those with excessive heat, administer four to five doses daily, adjusting as needed.
*Master Shen’s Formula* uses only five ingredients: dragon bone, dried ginger, oyster shell, talc, and kaolin.

For the one hundred twenty types of wind, epilepsy, fright mania, and seizures with foaming at the mouth and loss of awareness, the following should be taken in the fourth or fifth month:
Purple fluorite, peony, dragon bone (one version substitutes scutellaria), green kaolin, dictamnus root, ephedra, Chinese angelica, licorice, trichosanthes root, cinnamon bark, and ginseng—each two *liang*;
Oyster shell—three *liang*;
Rhubarb—five *liang*.
Grind the thirteen ingredients, sift into coarse powder, and divide into seven portions. For each dose, boil ten jujubes in three *sheng* of water, reduce to two and a half *sheng*, discard the dregs, add one portion of the powder, and boil down to one *sheng*. Take the full dose at once, with seven days between doses; recovery follows completion of the course.

*Formula for Epilepsy and Reversal Seizures*:
*Fangji*, hematite, ginseng, lead oxide, white stiff silkworm, raw pig’s teeth, gambir vine, spirit poria, *leigong* fungus, tiger bone, *yuanzhi*, cinnamon bark, and ledebouriella—each six *fen*;

*Xiongqiong Decoction* for wind-induced epilepsy with pulling pain in the flanks, onset marked by vomiting and cicada-like ringing in the ears:
*Xiongqiong*, *gaoben*, and *louyu*—each five *liang*.
Chop the three ingredients, add to one *dou* of wine, and boil down to three *sheng*. Take the full dose at once; for the weak, divide into two doses, inducing profuse sweating.

*Formula for Wind-Induced Epilepsy* (from *Essential Records*, titled *Owl-Head Pills*):

Kansui, *tianxiong*, Sichuan pepper, and *daji*—each two *fen*;

Grind the thirteen ingredients into powder and form into honey pills the size of parasol seeds. Take two pills with hot wine or water, three times daily.

*Alternative Formula*:
Rehmannia—thirty *jin*;
Asparagus—ten *jin*.
Pound to extract the juice and simmer into a thick paste; take to cure the condition.

*Alternative Formula*:
Pound and sift three *sheng* of henbane seeds, steep in one *dou* of wine for half a day, strain, and simmer the liquid until it can be formed into pills. Take two small bean-sized pills before meals, increasing to two parasol seed-sized pills, adjusting the dose until the desired effect is achieved. The sign of efficacy is redness rising along the lines of the palms and forehead. If this sign does not appear, continue taking the pills. For daily episodes, cure follows in three days; for alternate-day episodes, ten days; for five-day intervals, twenty days; for six-month intervals, one month.

*Formula for Epilepsy, Spasms, and Convulsions*:
Lead oxide—one *jin*;
Owl’s head—two (flying).
Grind into powder and form into honey pills. Take three pills before meals, three times daily; for severe cases, take one additional dose at night, gradually increasing the dose.

*Asparagus Wine*, universally effective for:
Great wind pervading the five viscera and six bowels, collapse and depletion, vacuity and weakness, the five taxations and seven damages, concretions and stagnation, qi blockages, cold and heat winds, epilepsy and malign illnesses, deafness and head wind, tetanic contraction of the limbs, wilting and migratory joint pain, and the myriad diseases. Long-term consumption extends years, rejuvenates the body, regrows fallen teeth, and restores white hair to black.

*Method*:
Asparagus resembles *baibu*; asparagus is sweet and square at both ends, while *baibu* is slender, long, and bitter, causing diarrhea.
Pound to extract two *dou* of juice, add two *sheng* of clear yeast, and ferment with two *dou* of glutinous rice, following standard household brewing methods. In spring and summer, serve the rice extremely cold; in autumn and winter, warm it to body temperature before eating. When the wine is ready, take one cup of the clear liquid, maintaining a continuous mild intoxication without reaching vomiting. Avoid raw, cold, sour, and slippery foods, as well as chicken, pork, fish, and garlic; especially avoid carp and greasy foods.

This is the method for one *dou* of juice; for larger quantities (one *shi* or two *shi*), scale proportionally. After ten days of consumption, the body may develop hidden rashes with intense itching; after twenty days, the itching worsens; by thirty days, it gradually subsides—all signs of wind qi being expelled. By forty days, the body and mind feel clear and greatly relieved, as if transformed; by fifty days, the relief is even greater. Sitting or lying in the wind, one feels it no longer affects the body, and all internal winds are entirely dispelled.

*Rice Preparation*:
Thoroughly wash the rice, dry it in the sun, and just before use, soak it in fresh asparagus juice. Dry and steam the rice, mixing the remaining juice into the cooked rice. Seal tightly.

*Extracting Asparagus Juice*:
Wash the asparagus clean, remove the heart and skin, dry, and cut into pieces. Pound and press three to four times until the dregs are as dry as grass.

When first ready, this wine tastes sour and emits a foul, watery odor, but with continued consumption as directed, it becomes fragrant and delicious—unmatched by other wines. Seal for twenty-eight days for best results. Prepare small batches in the eighth and ninth months, larger batches in the tenth month, and continue consumption until the thirtieth day of the fifth month of the following year. It may also be prepared in the third month of spring, but not after the fourth month.

When taking this wine, combining it with the powder form enhances its efficacy and speed. The powder formula follows.

*Powder Formula*:
Remove the heart and skin from asparagus, dry in the sun, and grind into powder. Take one square-inch spoonful with the wine, three times daily, increasing to three spoonfuls. Long-term consumption confers longevity; it may also be taken with other wines.

*Moxibustion Methods*:
For adult epilepsy and infantile fright epilepsy, moxa the second vertebra of the back and the lower end of the coccyx at two points. Measure the distance between these points with a string, fold it in half, and mark the midpoint on the spine. Moxa these three points. Then, cut the string into three equal lengths, arrange them in a triangle (△), and place one end at the central moxa point, with the other two ends flanking the spine. Moxa these five points, each with one hundred cones. Use bamboo strips as a measure, which is superior to string. Mark the five moxa points with cinnabar.

For sudden epilepsy, moxa the depression at the top of the penis with three cones until urination is unobstructed, achieving cure. *Supplement to the Thousand Gold Pieces* states this point is at the urethral orifice. Alternatively, moxa the glans penis with three cones; the big toe’s hairy region with seven cones; the scrotal raphe with fourteen cones; both nipples with three cones each; and the Governing Vessel with thirty cones, repeated three times (the point is on the midline of the nose, entering the hairline). Additionally, moxa *tianchuang* and *baihui*, gradually increasing to three hundred cones each, using small moxa. Also, moxa the hairline above both ears with fifty cones each.

*Discourse*:
The Yellow Emperor asked: "There is a disease of raging madness; how does it arise?"
Qibo replied: "It arises from yang."
The Emperor asked: "How does yang cause people to rage?"
Qibo replied: "When yang qi is violently obstructed and difficult to resolve, it leads to frequent anger; the disease is called yang reversal."
The Emperor asked: "How can one recognize it?"
Qibo replied: "The Yangming channel is normally active, while the Taiyang and Shaoyang are not. If the inactive channels become hyperactive, this is the sign."

The Emperor asked: "How is it treated?"
Qibo replied: "Reduce their food intake, and the disease will resolve. For food enters the yin to nourish the yang; thus, depriving them of food will cure it. Have them take *shengtieluo* as a post-meal remedy, for *shengtieluo* swiftly descends the qi."

*Discourse*:
Whenever madness erupts with a desire to flee, or when patients exalt themselves as supremely wise or claim divine sagacity, all such cases must be thoroughly treated with moxibustion to achieve lasting recovery. If, however, they weep sorrowfully or moan in distress, this is due to pathogenic influence rather than madness, and should be treated according to methods for pathogenic disorders.

When pathogenic influence enters the yang, it causes madness; when it enters the yin, it causes blood impediment.
When pathogenic influence enters the yang and transmits further, it becomes *dian* and convulsions; when it enters the yin and transmits further, it becomes pain and muteness.
When yang enters yin, the disease is tranquil; when yin enters yang, the disease is rage.

*Tuo Jia Decoction*:
Governs pathogenic qi manifesting as tears during dreams or wakefulness, aversion to human voices, bodily soreness and emaciation, alternating chills and fever, stiffness and pain in the lumbar spine, abdominal tension, loss of appetite, or conditions arising after illness, overwork, or exhaustion, or due to transgressing taboos and various forms of excess. For women after childbirth with menstrual irregularities, discharging blue, red, or white matter, bodily emaciation, muscle depletion, scanty urine, or alternating fever and chills over the head and body, or extreme fatigue lasting days after a single act of intercourse. The formula consists of:

Seven *tuo* shells
Two *liang* each of licorice, *baiwei* (or *baizhi*), fritillaria, and scutellaria
Two and a half *liang* each of ephedra, peony, and atractylodes
Three *liang* of saposhnikovia
Four *liang* each of *ningshuishi*, cinnamon bark, poria, and anemarrhena
Six *liang* of gypsum

Grind the fourteen ingredients, decoct in two *dou* of water, and reduce to four *sheng*. Take one *sheng* warm, three times during the day and once at night.

The Nine-Substance Ox Yellow Pill treats men afflicted by ghostly possession on the verge of death, manifesting as terrifying visions, an urge to flee, and intermittent respite—all caused by pathogenic qi, rendering the sufferer unable to break free. The formula consists of:

One *liang* each of:

- Vitex fruit (Human Essence)
- Azurite (Azure Dragon Essence)
- Jade shavings (White Tiger Essence)

**Acupuncture and Moxibustion Diagrams and Techniques for Various Manic and Demonic Possessions**:

**Discourse**:
All manner of demonic afflictions arise from diverse origins, manifesting in varied forms that reveal the onset of manic possession. Symptoms may include silence, incessant babbling, singing, weeping, chanting, or laughter. Some may sleep or sit in ditches, consuming filth; others may strip naked, wander day and night, or hurl unrestrained curses. Still others may be possessed by flying insects, venomous creatures, or spirits, exhibiting erratic hand movements and darting eyes. For such manic and possessed individuals, acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicinal treatments are jointly administered.

Those who divine by wind also attribute such conditions to demonic influence. Bian Que stated: "For all afflictions caused by the hundred demons, there are thirteen acupuncture points. The procedure begins at *Ghost Palace*, then proceeds to *Ghost Faith*, followed by *Ghost Rampart*, and *Ghost Heart*. It is not necessary to needle all points; five or six will suffice to discern the truth. If the possessing entity is a spectral or venomous spirit, it will speak, revealing its origins. Once verified, the spirit may be compelled to depart without needing to exhaust its life force."

For men, begin needling on the left; for women, on the right. If the spirit remains silent after several points, needle all prescribed locations. Follow the techniques precisely, combining acupuncture and moxibustion as required. Additionally, employ the *Yellow Emperor’s Palm Technique* to manipulate the eyes for treatment—success is assured.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Palm Technique* is a secret art of exorcists, binding demons and restraining malevolent forces. It governs the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, mountain spirits, and spectral entities, all of which are subdued by the eyes located between the ten finger joints of the practitioner’s hands.

**First point**: *Renzhong* (Philtrum), called *Ghost Palace*. Insert the needle from the left, exiting on the right.

**Second point**: Beneath the thumbnail of the thumb, called *Ghost Faith*. Insert three *fen* into the flesh.

**Third point**: Beneath the big toenail, called *Ghost Rampart*. Insert two *fen* into the flesh.

**Fourth point**: The transverse crease on the back of the hand, called *Ghost Heart*. Insert half an *cun*. This is *Taiyuan* point.

**Fifth point**: Below the lateral malleolus at the white flesh border of the foot *Taiyang* meridian, called *Ghost Path*. Fire needle seven times, thrusting three times per insertion. This is *Shenmai* point.

**Sixth point**: One *cun* above *Dazhui* within the hairline, called *Ghost Pillow*. Fire needle seven times, thrusting three times per insertion.

**Seventh point**: In the depression of the hairline anterior to the ear, five *fen* below the earlobe, called *Ghost Bed*. Fire needle seven times, thrusting three times per insertion.

**Eighth point**: *Chengjiang* (below the lower lip), called *Ghost Market*. Insert from the left, exiting on the right.

**Ninth point**: Three *cun* above the transverse crease of the wrist between the two tendons, called *Ghost Path*. This is *Laogong* point.

**Tenth point**: One *cun* above the midpoint of the nose within the hairline, called *Ghost Hall*. Fire needle seven times, thrusting three times per insertion. This is *Shangxing* point.

**Eleventh point**: The perineal seam (for men) or the head of the vaginal orifice (for women), called *Ghost Storehouse*. Moxa three cones.

**Twelfth point**: At the lateral end of the transverse crease of *Chize*, where the white flesh begins, called *Ghost Minister*. Fire needle seven times, thrusting three times per insertion. This is *Quchi* point.

**Thirteenth point**: One *cun* from the tip of the tongue, along the midline of the tongue’s underside, piercing through to the upper surface, called *Ghost Seal*. Secure the needle with a board across the mouth to prevent tongue movement.

For the aforementioned points, if they are paired on both hands and feet, needle both sides. For solitary points, needle once.

For demonic ravings, moxa *Xuanming* fourteen times. The point lies at the central string-like ridge inside the lips.

**First point**: Called *Ghost Stipend*. Alternatively, use a sharp blade to sever the string-like ridge for best effect.

For demonic illness with stuporous unconsciousness, treat at *Fengfu*. Also called *Ghost Point*.

For demonic illness with loud shouting, cursing, and running, moxa the tips of all ten fingers, one *fen* from the nails. Also called *Ghost City*.

For demonic illness with ghostly epilepsy, heaviness in the four limbs, treat at the fontanel. Also called *Ghost Gate*.

**Spleen Formulas**
**Discourse on the Spleen, Chapter One**

The discourse states: The spleen governs *yi* (intention). The spleen is the abode of *yi*. *Yi* is the will that stores and recalls. It serves as the Remonstrating Grand Master, receiving from the four viscera. What the heart recalls is called *yi*; what *yi* preserves is called *zhi* (will); through *zhi* one stores and transforms, which is called *si* (thought); through *si* one yearns for the distant, which is called *lü* (contemplation); through *lü* one engages with things, which is called *zhi* (wisdom).

*Yi* is the spleen’s repository. The lips are the spleen’s officials. The spleen’s *qi* communicates with the mouth; when the mouth is harmonious, it can distinguish the five grains’ flavors. Thus, the mouth is said to be *wu* (Earth’s celestial stem), the tongue and lips *ji* (Earth’s earthly branch). It circulates through the central palace, ascends to the cheeks, next observes the lips, then returns to the spleen’s center. Its glory flourishes on the tongue. Externally, it governs flesh; internally, it governs flavor.

The spleen weighs two *jin* and three *liang*, is three *cun* wide and flat, five *cun* long, and contains half a *jin* of dispersed fat. It envelops the blood, warms the five viscera, and its spirit is named *bibi*. It governs the storage of *ying* (nutritive essence)—alternately called *yi*—and its official rank is the *Yi* Viscus. It responds to the seasons’ rhythms, hence it is said: the spleen stores *ying*, and *ying* houses *yi*. In *qi*, it manifests as belching; in fluids, as saliva.

When the spleen’s *qi* is deficient, the four limbs fail to function, and the five viscera are unsettled. When replete, the abdomen distends, and urination and defecation are impeded. If the spleen’s *qi* is deficient, one dreams of insufficient food and drink; when aligned with its season, one dreams of building walls and roofing houses. If the spleen’s *qi* is exuberant, one dreams of singing and music, heaviness in the body, and inability to lift the hands and feet.

When perverse *qi* invades the spleen, one dreams of hills, great marshes, collapsing houses, and wind and rain.

The spleen’s viscus resembles Earth and pairs with the stomach to form a *fu* (bowel). Its channel is the Foot Greater Yin, which internally and externally connects with the Yang Brightness. Its pulse is moderate. It corresponds to summer and flourishes in late summer.

The spleen is Earth—solid and blessed. "Solid" means thick. The myriad things, though diverse in color, are all called "blessed" when abundant. The myriad things suspend their roots and lodge their stems; their leaves reach the treetops. Worms, flying insects, crawling creatures, and gasping breaths all receive Earth’s grace. Its virtue is moderation; its grace, slowness. Thus, the Greater Yin is moderate and slow, with varying *chi* and *cun* measurements.

Sour, salty, bitter, and pungent flavors arise through great subtlety and intermingle in their seasons, each acting in its time. None acts alone, and all may be consumed regularly. When Earth is cold, warm it; when hot, cool it.

Earth has one child, named Metal. It embraces and holds it, never parting from its body. Yet Metal fears Fire, dreading its scorching heat. Thus, it abandons its mother and flees into Water. Water, as Metal’s child, conceals the Fire spirit, shutting its gates and sealing its doors, blocking all passage. This describes winter, when Earth loses its child and its *qi* wanes. Water overflows, soaking the land, striking the skin, causing facial and limb swelling.

Foolish physicians, seeing Water, immediately purge downward, weakening the spleen and emptying the stomach, allowing Water to occupy them. The lungs pant and float; the liver, fearing the lungs, sinks and submerges. Below lie thorns, feared to harm the body, so it retreats to the side, letting Water flow. The heart weakens and hides; the liver’s *qi* wanes and sinks. Thus, the pulse becomes hidden and deep.

The superior physician, through distant—or alternate reading: *recent*—divination, adjusts the acupuncture points, facilitating urination and defecation, thereby unblocking the waterways. Sweet fluids flow downward, balancing Yin and Yang. Panting lessens, and sweat flows properly. The liver anchors its root; the heart’s *qi* revives. Yang circulates through the four limbs; the lungs’ *qi* stands upright. Panting ceases, and the kidneys emit a peaceful sound. Their flavor is salty. Leaning against their ruined mother, they reek like fish. When Earth regains its child, it becomes a mountain; when Metal regains its mother, it is called a hill.

The four seasons’ order and the changes of reversal and compliance—why does only the spleen’s pulse differ? The spleen’s pulse is Earth, a solitary viscus that irrigates the four sides. Its goodness cannot be seen; only its evil is visible.

What does its evil arrival look like?

When the spleen’s pulse flows like water, this is called "excess," and the illness lies in the exterior. When it pecks like a crow’s beak, this is called "deficiency," and the illness lies within. Excess causes a person’s limbs to become heavy and unable to lift; deficiency causes the nine orifices to become obstructed and blocked, a condition called "double stiffness."

When the spleen’s pulse arrives harmonious and gentle, separating like a chicken scratching the earth, this is normal. In late summer, the stomach serves as its foundation. If the spleen’s pulse arrives full and rapid, like a chicken lifting its feet, this indicates spleen disease. If the spleen’s pulse arrives firm and sharp like a chicken’s beak (or a crow’s), like a crow’s spur, like a leaking roof, or like flowing water, this indicates the death of the spleen.

When the true spleen pulse arrives, it is weak and now sparse, now scattered (or rapid). If the complexion is yellow and dull without luster, and the body hair withers, death follows. In late summer, a slightly soft and weak stomach pulse is normal. If weakness dominates and the stomach pulse is faint, this indicates spleen disease. If it is merely intermittent without stomach *qi*, this indicates death. If it is soft and weak with a stony quality, this indicates winter illness; if the stony quality is severe, the illness is present.

The spleen stores *ying* (nutritive *qi*), and *ying* houses *yi* (intention). Unresolved sorrow and worry injure *yi*; when *yi* is injured, there is oppression and confusion, the limbs cannot lift, the body hair withers, and the complexion fades. Death occurs in spring.

When the *qi* of the foot Greater Yin is cut off, the pulse no longer nourishes the mouth and lips, for the lips are the foundation of the flesh. If the pulse fails to nourish, the flesh becomes flaccid; when the flesh is flaccid, the philtrum swells; when the philtrum swells, the lips invert. When the lips invert, the flesh dies first. If the condition is severe on *jia* day, death occurs on *yi* day, for Wood overcomes Earth.

When the spleen is a dead viscus, its pulse is large and slack (or firm) on the surface; when pressed, it feels like an overturned cup, hollow and trembling—this indicates death.

In the sixth month (late summer), *jiwei* is established, between *kun* and *wei*, the position of Earth and the time when the spleen flourishes. Its pulse is large, leisurely, and slow—this is normal. If instead it is floating, large, and surging, this is the heart overacting on the spleen, the mother returning to the child, a condition of "deficient evil"; though ill, it is easily treated. If instead it is faint, rough, and short, this is the lung overacting on the spleen, the child overacting on the mother, a condition of "excess evil"; though ill, it will self-resolve. If instead it is wiry and long, this is the liver overacting on the spleen, Wood restraining Earth, a condition of "thief evil," a grave reversal—ten deaths, no cure. If instead it is deep, soft, and slippery, this is the kidney overacting on the spleen, Water encroaching on Earth, a condition of "minor evil"; though ill, it will soon recover.

At the right *guan* position, if the Yin pulse is cut off, there is no spleen pulse. The patient suffers from shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal fullness, heaviness of the body, reluctance to move the limbs, and frequent retching. Treat by needling the foot Yangming to regulate Yang.

At the right *guan* position, if the Yin pulse is replete, this indicates spleen repletion. The intestines may feel hard like a hidden lump, and defecation is difficult. Treat by needling the foot Greater Yin to regulate Yin.

When the spleen’s pulse is long and weak, arriving sparsely and departing steadily (or rapidly), two beats per breath is normal; three beats indicate "departure from the channels" illness; four beats indicate loss of essence; five beats indicate death; six beats indicate the end of life. This is the pulse of the foot Greater Yin.

If the spleen’s pulse is extremely rapid, it causes convulsions; if slightly rapid, it causes fullness in the diaphragm, food and drink entering and then regurgitating, followed by foamy drool. If extremely slow, it causes flaccid reversal; if slightly slow, it causes wind-flaccidity, the limbs becoming useless, though the mind remains clear as if no illness exists. If extremely large, it causes sudden collapse; if slightly large, it causes spleen *shan*, with *qi* enveloping large accumulations of pus and blood outside the intestines and stomach. If extremely small, it causes alternating chills and fever; if slightly small, it causes wasting-thirst. If extremely slippery, it causes *long* (urinary block); if slightly slippery, it causes worm toxin, with roundworms in the intestines, rumbling, and heat. If extremely rough, it causes intestinal *ju* (abscess); if slightly rough, it causes internal ulceration with frequent discharge of pus and blood.

When the spleen’s pulse is forceful, firm, and long, and the complexion is yellow, the patient will suffer from shortness of breath. If the pulse is soft and scattered, and the complexion lacks luster, the patient will suffer from swelling of the shins resembling water.

When the yellow pulse arrives, large and vacuous, there is accumulated *qi* in the abdomen and counterflow *qi*, a condition called "counterflow *shan*." The same applies to women. It is caused by rapid exertion of the limbs followed by sweating in the wind.

Bian Que said: When the spleen is diseased, the complexion withers and turns yellow. In repletion, the root of the tongue becomes stiff and straight; in vacuity, there is frequent *pi* (abdominal masses) and a tendency to swallow. To treat repletion, if Yang *qi* is robust, the patient dreams of eating and drinking.

The spleen governs singing in sound, belching in movement, and thought in emotion. Thought injures the spleen; when essence and *qi* converge in the spleen, hunger arises. Its sound corresponds to late summer. For illnesses that transform in sound, treat the channels.

Unresolved fear and dread injure essence; when essence is injured, the bones ache, and there is flaccid reversal. If essence frequently descends spontaneously, this causes essence illness. Thus, the five viscera are the masters that store essence; they must not be injured. Injury causes the guardian to be lost and Yin to become vacuous; vacuity leads to absence of *qi*, and absence of *qi* leads to death.

When illness first arises in the spleen, there is blockage and obstruction, pain throughout the body, and heaviness. After one day, it reaches the stomach, causing abdominal distension. After two days, it reaches the kidneys, causing pain in the lower abdomen, waist, and spine, with aching channels. After three days, it reaches the bladder, causing pain in the back, spine, and sinews, with urinary block. If it persists for ten days without resolution, death occurs—at the hour of *rending* in winter or the hour of *yan shi* in summer.

When the illness is in the spleen, clarity comes at *die* (late afternoon); it worsens at dawn, stabilizes at midday, and quiets at *xia bu* (late afternoon). *The Plain Questions* states it worsens at sunrise. Wang Bing notes: "Stabilizes at midday" is an error.

If a spleen illness arises from traveling east or eating pheasant, rabbit meat, or various fruits, it is so obtained. Otherwise, it will erupt in spring, and the illness begins on *jia* or *yi* days.

Generally, the signs of spleen illness include heaviness of the body, frequent hunger, and flaccid feet that cannot be lifted. *The Plain Questions* states: "tendency toward muscle flaccidity, feet that cannot be lifted." *The Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion* states: "suffering from hunger, muscle flaccidity, feet that cannot be lifted." The patient often experiences convulsions and pain beneath the feet.

In vacuity, there is abdominal fullness, intestinal rumbling, undigested food in diarrhea. Treat by selecting the foot Greater Yin, Yangming, and Lesser Yin channels to bleed.

When the spleen’s pulse is deep and soft, or floating and vacuous, the patient suffers from abdominal distension, vexation, and fullness, heat in the stomach, loss of appetite, undigested food, difficult defecation, painful impediment in the limbs, and occasional numbness. This is caused by sexual activity or menstruation that does not arrive or arrives frequently and in profusion.

In spleen disease, the complexion appears yellow, food and drink are not digested, the abdomen suffers from distension and fullness, the body feels heavy, the joints ache, and defecation is difficult. When the pulse is slightly slow and long, this condition is treatable. It is appropriate to administer the *Pingwei* Pill, *Xiepi* Pill, *Zhuyu* Pill, or *Fuzi* Decoction. In spring, one should needle *Yinbai*; in winter, *Yinlingquan*—both to drain. In summer, needle *Dadu*; in late summer, *Gongsun*; in autumn, *Shangqiu*—all to supplement. Additionally, one should moxa *Zhangmen* with fifty cones and the eleventh vertebra on the back with one hundred cones.

When evil resides in the spleen and stomach, the muscles and flesh ache. If yang qi is in excess and yin qi is insufficient, there is heat in the center, with frequent hunger. If yang qi is insufficient and yin qi is in excess, there is cold in the center, with intestinal rumbling and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang are in excess or both are insufficient, there will be both cold and heat—adjust this by regulating *Zusanli*.

If one is struck or falls, or enters the bedchamber while drunk or satiated, sweating and exposed to wind, the spleen will be injured. When the spleen is injured, the central qi is affected, yin and yang separate, and yang does not follow yin—thus, one uses the three divisions to prognosticate life and death.

When the spleen is struck by wind, there is a mild fever, the appearance of a drunken person, vexation and heaviness in the abdomen, twitching of the skin and flesh, and shortness of breath. When the spleen is struck by cold...

In spleen water disease, the patient’s abdomen is enlarged, the four limbs suffer from heaviness, bodily fluids are not generated, and there is only distress from shortness of breath and difficult urination.

In spleen distension, there is frequent yawning, tension in the four limbs (alternatively: fullness), heaviness of the body, and inability to dress (alternatively: lift). When the *Fuyang* pulse is floating and rough, a floating pulse indicates strong stomach qi, while a rough pulse indicates frequent urination. When floating and rough pulses contend, the stool becomes hard, and the spleen is constrained. In spleen constraint, the patient’s stool is hard, urination is smooth, yet they are paradoxically not thirsty.

When spleen qi is weak, there is diarrhea with white discharge, intestinal filth, hard stool, inability to change clothes, and incessant sweating—this is called spleen qi weakness. Alternatively, the five fluids may discharge as blue, yellow, red, white, or black.

When the *Cunkou* pulse is wiry and slippery, a wiry pulse indicates pain, while a slippery pulse indicates repletion. Pain leads to urgency, and repletion leads to throbbing. When pain and throbbing contend, there is sudden tension in the chest and rib-sides.

When the *Fuyang* pulse is floating and rough, a floating pulse indicates weak stomach qi, while a rough pulse indicates debilitated spleen qi. When weakness and debility contend, breathing becomes difficult—this is the spleen’s loss of regulation.

When the *Cunkou* pulse is doubly tight, it indicates internal penetration. The qi does not exit, there is no exterior but an interior, and hardness and fullness below the heart.

When the *Fuyang* pulse is faint and rough, a faint pulse indicates absence of stomach qi, while a rough pulse indicates injury to the spleen. Cold resides in the diaphragm, yet purging is applied, causing cold accumulation to remain unresolved. The stomach is weak, the spleen is injured, grain qi does not move, and after eating, there is spontaneous belching. Cold resides in the chest and diaphragm, with vacuity above and repletion below. Grain qi does not pass, resulting in blockage and obstruction.

When the *Cunkou* pulse is slow and delayed, a slow pulse pertains to yang, its qi is long, while a delayed pulse pertains to yin, with construction qi hastened (alternatively: insufficient). When construction and defense are harmonized, hardness and softness are balanced, the three burners are mutually supportive, and the qi must be strong.

When the *Fuyang* pulse is slippery and tight, a slippery pulse indicates replete stomach qi, while a tight pulse indicates injury to spleen qi. If food is consumed but not digested, this indicates the spleen is incurable. If one can eat but the abdomen is not full, this indicates excess stomach qi. If the abdomen is full but one cannot eat, with the sensation of hunger below the heart, this indicates stagnant stomach qi and vacuous heart qi. If fullness occurs after eating, this indicates the spleen is incurable.

When the area below the patient’s nose is flat, this indicates stomach disease. If it is slightly red, an abscess will form. If slightly black, there is heat. If blue, there is cold. If white, it is incurable. If the lips are black, the stomach was the first to be diseased. If slightly dry and thirsty, it is treatable; if not thirsty, it is incurable. If the navel protrudes, this indicates the spleen has prolapsed (alternatively: the spleen is the first to fail).

Generally, when a patient’s illness has resolved but there is slight vexation in the evening, others see the patient recovering and force them to eat. However, the spleen and stomach qi are still weak and cannot digest grain, thus causing slight vexation. Reducing grain intake will lead to recovery.

When spleen accumulation is diagnosed, the pulse is floating, large, and long. Hunger reduces it, while satiety makes it visible, contending with grain and diminishing. Below the heart, there are lumps like peaches or plums protruding externally. The abdomen is full, with vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal rumbling, heaviness in the four limbs, swelling along the foot channel, reversal cold, and inability to lie down. This governs damage to the muscles and flesh, with a yellow complexion.

The accumulation of the spleen is called *pi qi*, located in the stomach duct, covering an area as large as a plate. If it persists without cure, the disease causes the four limbs to fail, yellow jaundice, and food and drink not transforming into flesh. It is contracted on *ren* or *gui* days in winter.

When liver disease transmits to the spleen, the spleen should transmit to the kidney. However, the kidney is in its ruling phase in winter and does not receive evil. The spleen then attempts to return the evil to the liver, but the liver refuses to accept it, causing it to linger and bind into an accumulation. Thus, it is known that *pi qi* is contracted in winter.

In spleen disease, the complexion is yellow, the body is blue, there is urinary incontinence, fixed staring, retraction of the lips, blue nail beds, vomiting and counterflow of food and drink, heaviness of the body, aching joints, and inability to lift the four limbs. The pulse should be floating, large, and slow, but instead it is wiry and urgent. The complexion should be yellow, but instead it is blue—this is wood overwhelming earth, a great counterflow. It is incurable, with no chance of survival in ten cases.

For those of the *gong* tone, the spleen governs the voice. The spleen’s voice is singing, its emotion is sorrow, and its channel is the foot Greater Yin.

When yangming reversal occurs, construction and defense do not communicate, yin and yang invert, yang qi strikes internally, and yin qi injures externally. Injury leads to cold, cold leads to vacuity, and vacuity leads to emaciation of the entire body. The voice is deep and rough, like the sound of a broken drum. The tongue is stiff and cannot turn, with a tendency to swallow saliva. The mouth is clenched, the lips are black, the four limbs cannot be lifted, the body is as heavy as a mountain, and there is incessant diarrhea. In severe cases, it is incurable. It is governed by the *Mahuang* Decoction, following the source. The formula is in the scroll.

It is also said that the voice expresses worry and fear, the root of the tongue curls and retracts—this is wood overwhelming earth, yang striking yin, yin qi lying hidden, and yang qi rising. When it rises, it becomes replete; when replete, it generates heat; and heat leads to oppression and disorder. The body is heavy and cannot turn, the voice is drawn out, the breath is deep and does not turn, and the heart is anxious. This is evil heat injuring the spleen. In severe cases, it is incurable.

If the lips are withered and yellow but the speech remains clear, it may still be treated. When spleen disease manifests as malaria, it causes the person to feel cold, experience abdominal pain, and when heat arises, the intestines rumble; once the rumbling ceases, sweat breaks out. It is governed by the *Changshan* Pill. The formula is in another scroll.

If a person is naturally mild-tempered but suddenly becomes unusually prone to anger or laughter, speaks coherently yet sniffs through the nose, or laughs without responding to others, these are signs of spleen disease affecting the voice. Within ten days to a month, misfortune will surely arrive.

For illnesses of yin and yang, and the origins of the channels and collaterals, one must thoroughly investigate the disease, identify its principles, and then proceed with treatment—thus, nothing will be overlooked.

Yellow corresponds to the spleen, and the spleen governs the flesh. A yellow complexion resembling the color of a *zhi* fruit on the abdomen is auspicious. The spleen governs the mouth and lips, and the lips are the surplus of the spleen. A person of earth constitution resembles the upper palace: yellow in color, with a large head, round face, broad shoulders, a strong back, a well-proportioned abdomen, slender thighs and shins, fleshy hands and feet, upper and lower body in harmony, a steady gait with flat footsteps, a fondness for benefiting others, no desire for power, a tendency to rely on others, endurance in autumn and winter, but susceptibility to illness in spring and summer. Such a person is governed by the foot *Taiyin* channel, which is steadfast and sincere.

The spleen corresponds to the moon, which waxes and wanes, and the spleen’s size varies with the size of the lips. If the upper lip is thick and the lower lip thin, with no gum above the teeth and the lips cracked or uneven, the spleen is not upright. If the lips are raised and protruding, the spleen is elevated; elevation leads to repletion, repletion to heat, and heat to pain and fullness in the hypochondrium. If the lips are drooping, large, and flaccid, the spleen is sunken; sinking leads to deficiency, deficiency to peril, peril to cold, and cold to heaviness of the body, making walking difficult. If the lips are firm, the spleen is firm; firmness ensures the organ’s stability, and stability prevents illness. If the upper and lower lips are well-formed, the spleen is upright; uprightness ensures harmony between the spleen and stomach, and the person remains free of disease. If the lips are unevenly raised, the spleen is prone to pain and distension.

Whenever a person’s facial regions show depressions or protrusions, illness will arise. The *Yangming* of the stomach is the region of the spleen, and the organ’s qi communicates internally and externally, with its regions responding accordingly. The deep and turbid pertain to the interior, while the floating and clear pertain to the exterior. If an external illness invades, the corresponding region will protrude; protrusion indicates draining yang first and supplementing yin afterward. If an internal illness emerges, the corresponding region will sink; sinking indicates treating yin first and yang afterward. Yang corresponds to repletion and heat, while yin corresponds to deficiency and cold. Cold governs the exterior, and heat governs the interior.

A person’s life, death, fortune, or misfortune can be foretold by the spirits of the organs manifesting changes externally. When the spleen is about to fall ill, the lips become parched and dry; when the spleen is about to die, the lips turn dry, greenish-white, and gradually contract, with the teeth clenched shut. If the color of the tomb corresponds to the region between the heavens, death is inevitable and untreatable. By observing the thickness or thinness of the complexion, one can determine whether the outcome will be delayed or imminent—if delayed, it will occur within four hundred days; if imminent, within ten to thirty days.

If the spleen disease appears to improve but the patient suddenly dies, how can one know? It is said: if a dark bluish-black mark the size of a thumb appears on the cheek, sudden death is certain. When the spleen is exhausted, death occurs within twelve days. How can one know? If the mouth is cold, the feet are swollen, the abdomen is hot and distended, and diarrhea occurs without awareness, death will come in one to five days. If the face is green and the eyes yellow, death will come in five days.

When a patient lies in bed with heart pain and shortness of breath, the spleen’s depletion causes internal injury. Recovery may take a hundred days, during which the patient may rise and wander restlessly, then sit on the ground or lean against the bed. One who can treat this condition may be called divinely skilled.

Furthermore, a yellow face with red eyes does not indicate death, but a yellow complexion like that of *zhi* fruit does. Auspicious and inauspicious signs lie in the facial regions; if a faint black or yellow hue appears on the lips, illness will strike within the year. The corresponding acupoint is on the nose, between the eyes—this is its region. If the area above the years does not respond, misfortune will surely arrive within three years.

In late summer, the spleen’s pulse and color are yellow, governed by the foot *Taiyin* channel. Its root lies four *cun* above *Zhongfeng*, which is located one *cun* anterior to the medial malleolus, in the depression between the tendons. The channel’s root ascends from *Zhongfeng* to this point and originates at *Yinbai*, which is on the medial side of the tip of the big toe.

Its sinews begin at the medial side of the tip of the big toe, ascend to bind at the medial malleolus, then proceed upward to bind at the medial aspect of the knee, follow the inner thigh to bind at the hip, gather at the genitals, ascend the abdomen to bind at the umbilicus, follow the abdomen to bind at the ribs, disperse in the chest, and internally attach to the spine.

Its channel begins at the tip of the big toe, follows the medial side of the toe along the border of the white flesh, passes behind the metatarsal bone, ascends the anterior border of the medial malleolus, follows the posterior aspect of the shin, crosses and emerges anterior to the *Jueyin* channel, ascends the medial anterior aspect of the knee and thigh, enters the abdomen, connects with the spleen and links with the stomach, ascends the diaphragm to flank the throat, connects with the root of the tongue, and disperses beneath it. Its branch separates from the stomach, ascends the diaphragm, and pours into the heart, joining the foot *Yangming* as its exterior-interior pair.

The root of the *Yangming* lies at *Lidui*, in the depression three *cun* above the web between the big toe and the second toe on the dorsum of the foot, and it converges with the hand *Taiyin*. The collateral of the foot *Taiyin* is called *Gongsun*, located one *cun* behind the base of the big toe’s metatarsophalangeal joint, and it diverges to connect with the *Yangming*. This branch enters to network the intestines and stomach.

When the spleen generates disease, repletion leads to stomach heat; heat causes cutting pain in the abdomen, and pain indicates yang disease, with the yang pulse exceeding the *cunkou* pulse by threefold. The illness manifests as stiffness of the tongue, contraction of the sinews and testicles, pulling pain in the inner thigh and hip, abdominal distension, heaviness of the body, inability to eat or drink, vexation, urgency below the heart, and diarrhea—all signs of spleen disease. Deficiency leads to stomach cold; cold causes drum-like distension in the abdomen, and distension indicates yin disease, with the yin pulse smaller than the *cunkou* pulse by onefold.

When the disease manifests, it causes watery diarrhea, inability to lie down with vexation, forced standing, pain in the inner thighs and knees, and suffering from sinew spasms and twisting. The twisting refers to the pulse intermittently throbbing in a bound rhythm; if the throbbing becomes severe, the condition is incurable and fatal.

During the final eighteen days of each of the four seasons—these being the surplus days of the four seasons—the spleen and stomach govern, and the "yellow flesh" follows the disease (or: "internal yang disease"). Its origin lies in the opposition between *Taiyin* and *Yangming*, the shifting of seasonal nodes, and the disharmony of cold and dampness in the *Sanjiao*. When the four seasons’ barriers and blockages arise, the viscera and bowels are harmed, and pestilential qi is received in accordance with the time. Yang qi leaks outward while yin qi lies dormant within, causing the symptoms to oppose one another.

If the *fu*-organs are deficient, yin evil assails them, leading to heaviness of the head, stiffness of the neck, and rigidity and numbness of the skin and flesh. If the *zang*-organs are replete, yang epidemics injure them, causing accumulation and nodule formation, beginning at the sides of the throat and neck. Toxic heat spreads through the skin and flesh, dispersing upward into the hairline and penetrating downward through the temples. The heat lingers continuously, hence it is called "yellow flesh following the disease."

Bian Que said: Moxibustion at the liver and spleen transport points governs the treatment of cinnabar toxin, and for diseases of the four seasons, one must tonify or drain according to the source. When deficiency and repletion cause the skin and flesh to follow the heat, incising and draining, applying medicinal plasters, and reciting incantations will hasten the cure, leaving no escape for the illness.

**Discourse:**
For long-standing food stagnation in the upper *guan*, induce vomiting. A rapid and slippery pulse indicates excess with undigested food—purgation will resolve it. If there is stagnation in the stomach, cold food causes pain and inability to eat, while warm food is tolerated. For food stagnation in the abdomen, chills and fever resembling malaria occur; if stagnation is in the lower abdomen, fever arises at dusk and subsides by dawn. A tight pulse at the *cun* position indicates headache from wind-cold or undigested food in the abdomen. A tight pulse at the *cunkou*, resembling a twisting rope with no fixed position, signifies undigested food in the spleen and stomach. A floating and large pulse at the *cunkou* that feels rough upon pressure, with a faint and rough pulse at the *chi* position, confirms food stagnation.

**Spleen Labor, Third Discourse and Formulas**

**Discourse on Spleen Labor**

It is said: For all spleen labor disorders, one must supplement the lung *qi* to benefit it, for when the lung flourishes, it nourishes the spleen. Thus, the sage nurtures *yang qi* in spring and summer and cultivates *yin qi* in autumn and winter, aligning with the root. The liver and heart are *yang*; the spleen, lungs, and kidneys are *yin*. To act contrary to the root is to harm the foundation. The *yin* and *yang* of the four seasons are the beginning and end of all things.

**Fourth Discourse on Flesh Exhaustion and Formulas**

It is said: All flesh exhaustion is governed by the spleen, for the spleen corresponds to flesh, and flesh unites with the spleen. If the spleen is diseased, the flesh changes color.

It is further said: When *Taiyin* encounters illness, it becomes muscle impediment (*ji bi*). If muscle impediment persists and is again assailed by pathogenic *qi*, it lodges internally in the spleen. The body itches incessantly, as if mice scurry across it. The fluids and humors deplete, the interstices open, and sweat profusely flows. The tip of the nose turns yellow—these are its signs.

When wind *qi* is stored in the skin, the flesh’s color deteriorates. On *wu* or *ji* days of late summer, injury by wind becomes spleen wind. The symptoms of spleen wind include profuse sweating, *yin* movement injuring cold, and cold causing deficiency. Deficiency leads to heaviness, fatigue, and reluctance to lift the limbs. One loses appetite; eating induces coughing, and coughing causes pain below the right rib, subtly extending to the shoulder and back. Movement becomes impossible—this is called *li feng* (severe wind), where deficiency is enveloped by excess.

If *yang* movement injures heat, heat causes repletion. Repletion makes one feel as if mice scurry across the body. The lips and mouth ulcerate, the skin’s color changes, the body’s fluids and humors deplete, the interstices open, and sweat profusely flows—this is called *e feng* (malign wind).

One must discern the guiding principles, know the beginning and end, the movement and stillness of *yin* and *yang*, and the deficiency or repletion of flesh. For repletion, drain; for deficiency, supplement.

To cure such illness, when wind first enters the flesh, skin, hair, muscles, and sinews, one must resolve it immediately. If it enters the six bowels and five viscera, half will die.

Bian Que said: When flesh is cut off, it is incurable, and death comes in five days. How does one know? The skin’s interstices are blocked, and external discharge is impossible.

Flesh corresponds to *Foot Taiyin*. When *Taiyin qi* is cut off, the vessels no longer nourish the muscles. If the lips invert, the *qi* is exhausted, and the flesh dies first. Even the finest medicine cannot cure it.

**Spleen Organ Formulas**
**Discourse on Deficiency and Excess of Flesh (Fifth)**

**Formula**
The discourse states: When the flesh is deficient, one cannot sit still, and the body is restless and unstable. When the flesh is in excess, one sits calmly without movement and experiences panting. The responses of flesh deficiency and excess are governed by the spleen. If the viscera or bowels develop illness arising from the flesh, heat corresponds to the viscera, while cold corresponds to the bowels.

**Wujiu Wine** treats flesh deficiency, inability to sit still, restlessness, and governs spleen disorders caused by cold qi injury:

**Spleen Prescriptions: Treatise on Heat Dysentery, Seventh**

**Pulse Signs, Prescriptions, and Moxibustion Methods**

The Master states: Since my youth, I have suffered from heat dysentery thrice and cold dysentery once. Each time, the condition raged with over a hundred bowel movements day and night, forcing me to move my bed beside the privy—such was my exhaustion. Yet, by treating myself as I saw fit, I recovered swiftly each time. Thus, I know this illness is easily cured throughout the world.

However, those of moderate disposition often grow arrogant and indolent. Though good medicine is bitter to the taste, they cannot discipline themselves to take it early. They wait from dawn to dusk, hoping for spontaneous recovery, while the disease worsens, stomach *qi* weakens, and both mental and physical strength wane. Unable to take food, drink, or medicine, they fail to recover in time and then claim dysentery is difficult to treat. Such errors are self-inflicted; scholars must deeply grasp this principle.

For this illness, any single remedy suited to the case may bring cure, provided one exerts effort and endures the bitterness of the medicine, taking it until recovery is complete. There is no case that cannot be healed. Moreover, one must strictly guard the diet: for severe cases, a hundred days afterward; for milder ones, a month. How often I lament the reckless and self-indulgent who cannot restrain themselves! Speaking of this fills me with profound regret.

From ancient times to the present, there are countless prescriptions for dysentery, too many to record in full. Here, I have selected only seven or eight of the most effective. Yet, their efficacy depends on the patient. Why? Pills like *Zhili Wan*, *Wumei Wan*, and *Songpi San*—when taken for acute dysentery, how could they fail to cure? For chronic cases, formulas like *Wenpi Tang* and *Jianpi Wan* (found in the section on cold dysentery) will surely bring recovery if taken over time.

Generally, dysentery has four types: cold, heat, infantile malnutrition (*gan*), and parasitic (*gu*). Cold dysentery produces white stool; heat dysentery, red. *Gan* dysentery mixes red and white without regularity, often accompanied by drowsiness and dry eyes. *Gu* dysentery involves pure bloody discharge.

For heat dysentery, increase *huanglian* and remove *ganjiang*. For cold dysentery, add warming herbs. For *gan*, administer medicine by insufflation or enema. For *gu* toxicity, treat with *gu* methods. When the medicine precisely matches the condition and the patient diligently takes it, how could recovery not follow?

When taking anti-dysentery medicine, the condition may initially worsen. The foolish, not understanding this, stop the medicine at once—this must not be done. If the medicine correctly targets the disease, persist despite the aggravation. After two or three doses, improvement will gradually appear. Only avoid medicines that do not match the condition.

For all dysentery cases, strictly avoid raw, cold, sour, or slippery foods, as well as pork, chicken, fish, oils, dairy, dried meats, fermented sauces, flour, and salty foods. All foods should be thoroughly cooked and soft; overeating must also be avoided. This is the great principle of convalescence. If one fails to observe these precautions, even a sage cannot save them.

**Pulse and Treatment of Diarrhea (Dysentery)**

- **Diarrhea with slippery and rapid pulse**: Indicates retained food; purgation is required.
- **Diarrhea with slow and slippery pulse**: Signifies excess; diarrhea will not cease until urgent purgation is applied.
- **Diarrhea with unexpectedly slippery pulse**: Indicates something to be expelled; recovery follows purgation.
- **Diarrhea with loss of appetite**: Indicates retained food; purgation is required.
- **Diarrhea with abdominal pain and fullness**: Signifies cold excess; purgation is needed.
- **Diarrhea with abdominal hardness**: Purgation is required.
- **Diarrhea with delirium**: Indicates dry stool in the abdomen; purgation is appropriate.
- **Diarrhea with both pulses (cun and chi) even (or floating) and epigastric hardness**: Urgent purgation is required.
- **Recurrent diarrhea at the same time of year, month, or day after recovery**: Indicates incomplete purgation; further purgation will cure it.
- **Wind-cold diarrhea**: Purgation is contraindicated. After purgation, if epigastric hardness and pain occur with a slow (or floating) pulse, this indicates cold; warming is required. A deep and tight pulse also calls for warming.
- **Diarrhea with large, floating, and wiry pulse**: Purgation will resolve it.
- **Diarrhea with floating and large pulse**: Indicates deficiency due to excessive purgation. If the pulse is floating and hollow, intestinal rumbling will follow; warming is required.
- **Diarrhea with slow and tight pulse**: Indicates pain; diarrhea will not cease without warming.
- **Cold-induced diarrhea**: Causes fullness and discharge of intestinal filth.
- **Diarrhea with body pain**: Urgent moxibustion and warming therapies (e.g., *Lizhong Tang*, *Sini Tang*, *Fuzi Tang*) are appropriate.
- **Diarrhea with anal pain**: Warming is required.
- **Diarrhea with abdominal distension and body pain**: First warm the interior, then treat the exterior.
- **Diarrhea with undigested food**: Do not attack the exterior; sweating will cause distension.
- **Flatulent diarrhea**: Promote urination.
- **Diarrhea with unexpectedly floating and rapid pulse, and rough chi pulse**: The patient will pass pus and blood.
- **Diarrhea with rapid pulse and thirst**: Will resolve spontaneously. If not, pus and blood will follow due to heat.
- **Diarrhea with deep and wiry pulse**: Indicates tenesmus. A large pulse means diarrhea will not cease; a faint, weak, and rapid pulse indicates imminent cessation, even if fever persists.
- **Diarrhea with deep and slow pulse, flushed face, slight fever, and undigested food**: The patient will experience dizziness and sweating before resolution, followed by mild cold limbs. This occurs because the face shows *yang* while the lower body is deficient.
- **Diarrhea with slight fever and thirst, and weak pulse**: Will resolve spontaneously.
- **Diarrhea with rapid pulse, slight fever, and sweating**: Will resolve spontaneously. If the pulse is tight, the condition is unresolved.
- **Diarrhea with wiry pulse, fever, and sweating**: Will resolve spontaneously.
- **Diarrhea with large, floating, and wiry pulse**: Purgation will resolve it.
- **Diarrhea with yellow, dry tongue and no thirst, chest fullness, and unceasing discharge**: Fatal.
- **Post-diarrhea with absent pulse and cold limbs**: If the pulse returns and limbs warm within a short time, the patient will live; if not, death follows.
- **Diarrhea with cold limbs and no pulse**: If moxibustion fails to warm and the pulse does not return, with faint wheezing, death ensues. A *shaoyin* pulse weaker than *fuyang* indicates a favorable prognosis.

When the qi of the six fu-organs is exhausted externally, the hands and feet grow cold, qi surges upward, and the legs contract. When the qi of the five zang-organs is exhausted internally, there is incontinence of stool; in severe cases, the hands and feet become numb. Careful examination will yield accurate diagnosis without fail. The general patterns of diarrheal diseases are as follows.

The *Suwen* states: "Injury by wind in spring leads to pus and blood in summer"—most cases of dysentery involve stagnation. "Injury by wind in summer leads to penetrating diarrhea in autumn"—autumnal diarrhea often involves watery discharge, and the condition is cold in nature. For diarrhea caused by accumulated cold, accumulated heat, or excess of water and grain, administer the *Da Huang Tang* to purge. Strong individuals should not exceed two doses; observe the patient’s condition for five or six days before administering another dose. If astringent and tonifying decoctions prove ineffective, another dose may be given after two or three days.

The *Zhili Wan* treats all diseases, including diarrhea and febrile illnesses with fever, headache, red eyes, vexing pain in the limbs, unresolved heat-binding diarrhea, or cases where prior treatment involved emesis and purgation, leaving the abdomen vacuous and vexed with a desire for cold drinks that cannot be digested, acute abdominal pain, vomiting upon consuming warm food, alternating heat and cold resembling warm malaria, or inhibited urination, qi fullness, retching, and unceasing diarrhea. The formula is as follows:

- *Shuizhong zhili* (water-borne *zhili*): 5 liang
- Purple fluorite: 3 liang
- Magnolia bark: 1 liang
- *Han Zhong* *mu fangji*: 6 liang
- *Longxi* tangkuei: 4 liang
- Coptis: 2 liang
- Aged bitter wine: 5 sheng
- High-quality fermented soybeans: 3 sheng

Take eight ingredients, all fresh and authentic. Soak the *fangji* in 2 sheng of bitter wine until thoroughly moistened, then remove it, reserving the wine. Slice the *fangji* into sections 1 *fen* thick, ensuring uniform thickness. Cover a tile with charcoal fire, line it with thick paper, and spread the sliced *fangji* on the paper. Turn the slices repeatedly until dry, then resoak them in the remaining bitter wine, remove, and dry again on the tile. Repeat until all the wine is used, ensuring the fire is gentle to dry the slices thoroughly. Grind each ingredient separately, then combine and pound a thousand times.

Soak the fermented soybeans in the remaining 3 sheng of bitter wine overnight. The next morning, place them in a tile basin, cover with another basin, and steam over five sheng of soil until the soil’s qi permeates the beans. Remove and grind the beans in the basin, then squeeze through new cloth to extract a thick juice resembling jujube paste. Mix with the powdered ingredients and pound three thousand times to form pills the size of water caltrop seeds. Divide into several pouches, hang to dry in the shade, then store in containers, sealing the edges tightly with wax to prevent exposure to wind and dust.

Take three pills as one dose. In the morning, take one dose with well-drawn water; take another at midday and another at dusk, all with water. Initially, eat lightly, favoring watery gruel. If digestion is smooth and the abdomen harmonious after taking the medicine, one dose per day suffices. If sourness develops, take a dose every two or three days, adjusting as needed. For severe illness where the medicine’s effect is delayed, increase to four or five doses per day. If diarrhea persists, further increase the dosage to ensure the abdomen retains the medicine’s strength. When food digests properly, the treatment is effective.

If the patient feels unsettled after starting the medicine, continue with watery gruel to support the medicine’s effect. Once the mind is clear, thicker gruel may be consumed, but it should remain cold. If the patient occasionally dislikes cold food, it indicates the medicine’s effect is waning; increase the dosage, and after about a day, the desire for cold food will return. To discontinue the medicine, gradually consume warmer food, and the medicine’s effect will naturally dissipate. There is no need to force excessive water intake; adjust according to the body’s condition.

For chronic diarrhea with vacuity, follow the above method. Avoid hot foods, raw fish, pork, garlic, raw vegetables, and wine, as wine stimulates the medicine’s effect, causing vexing heat in the patient. Also avoid pungent foods and rich, greasy, or hard-to-digest items.

For wind diseases, add 1 liang of *fangfeng*. For vacuity and emaciation, add 1 liang of *shihu*. For long-standing diarrhea with damaged intestines and stomach, add 2.5 liang of *taiyi yuliang* (select soft, fragrant stones with yellow interiors). For postpartum illnesses in women, add 2 liang of sulfur. For yellow or red inhibited urination, add 1 liang of *puhuang*. Adjust the formula as needed; efficacy is assured.

*Huqie* states: The old formula for five minerals includes 4 liang each of red halloysite, white quartz, stalactite, alum, and *yuyuliang*. These are typically combined in the second month.

For heat-type diarrhea unresponsive to other treatments:
- Mume fruit: 1 sheng
- Coptis (golden-colored): 1 jin
Grind into powder, mix with honey, and form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take twenty pills, three times during the day and twice at night. Divinely effective.

For chronic diarrhea lasting twenty or thirty years:
Remove the outer bark of *chisong* bark, slice 1 *dou*, and grind into powder. Mix 1 sheng with fermented grain gruel and take three times daily. Recovery occurs within a *dou*; for thirty-year diarrhea, one hundred days of treatment ensures permanent cure.

*Sun Zhenren’s Emergency Essential Prescriptions, Scroll Fifty-One Concluded*

The Imperial Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Service, Acting Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and Collator of the Secret Pavilion, Lin Yi et al., have collated and corrected:

**Formulas for the Spleen Viscus: Treatise Nine on Gan-Wetness**

The treatise states: All gan-wetness diseases arise from consuming rich, greasy, and oily foods during the summer months, compounded by sleeping in cold places. The *Rites* say: "In the height of summer, the noble person reduces rich flavors and avoids fatty, thick, or baked foods." This is because such foods are harmful to people; those who cultivate life should take strict heed. Otherwise, they will often suffer from gan-wetness dysentery.

The afflicted areas may appear on the gums, throat, or lower body—such as gan sores or "lunar erosion"—without pain, so the sufferer remains unaware. For treatment, use any one of the following, applied singly: toad (collected on the fifth day of the fifth month), *jiaohao* (horned artemisia), *jiuyuemu* (moon-rescue wood), or starch water from the Cold Food Festival. Burn to ash, mix with lard from the twelfth month, and apply. The condition will resolve immediately, but strict dietary caution is essential.

For gan sores, avoid salt, soy sauce, vinegar, butter, oil, dates, and the like—all are forbidden. Only plain rice, fermented soybeans, alfalfa, endive, and turnips are permitted without restriction.

When administering insufflated medicine into the lower body, insert it to a depth of approximately the middle finger’s length.

**Formula for Gan-Wetness with Black Discharge (Incurable by Physicians, Near Death):**
Skull ash, realgar, cinnabar, indigo, halite, cloves, musk, alum, gardenia, henbane seeds, iron filings, dried ginger, old shoe-sole ash, dried toad (collected on the fifth day of the fifth month), asarum, *tuguagen* (snake gourd root), mustard seeds, Sichuan pepper, *tingli* (pepperweed), and sweet flag—equal parts.
Grind the twenty ingredients into powder and sift. Using a bamboo tube, insufflate a dose the size of an apricot kernel into the affected area, applying it thoroughly to all gan sores. Grind cloves and musk separately and mix into the powder.
One variant includes starch water from the Cold Food Festival, *jiuyuemu* (moon-rescue wood), and willow leaves, totaling twenty-three ingredients.

For severe cases, use the following irrigation formula:
Musk, cloves, licorice, and rhinoceros horn—three *fen* each.
Grind the four ingredients into powder and sift. Combine with three *ge* of salt, three *ge* of Sichuan pepper, and two *ge* of fermented soybeans. Boil in two *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng*, strain, and mix with the powdered ingredients. Divide into two doses: irrigate the lower body once at dawn and once at dusk.
For chronic dysentery lasting a month without resolution, where gan symptoms develop and the anus becomes enlarged, this formula governs it.

**Eight-Ingredient Madder Root Decoction** governs cases of bloody discharge (a type of *gu* poison). The formula is found in the *Gu* treatise.

**Formula for Chronic Gan-Wetness Dysentery with Red-White Discharge (Unresponsive to Hundreds of Treatments):**
Rabbit skull, snake head, *ximi* seeds, ash of old crimson silk, *tingli* seeds, leopard bone (or fox bone), dung beetles, mugwort (collected on the fifth day of the fifth month), *daoguacao* (hanging grass), indigo, late silkworm moths, green vitriol, cloves, bedpost wood, scorpion feces, musk, *kushen* (flavescent sophora), *huangbo* (phellodendron), dried ginger, *jiaohao* (horned artemisia), cinnabar, stamped *guan* (washing basin), *jiuyuemu* (moon-rescue wood), cassia heartwood, iron filings, mirabilite, toad, yellow vitriol, and perilla seeds—equal parts.
Grind the twenty-nine ingredients into powder and sift. Insufflate into the lower body using a tube, once or twice daily. Wondrously effective.

**Formula for Gan-Wetness with Inability to Eat, Heavy Body, Heart Heat, Cold Feet, and Pain in All Joints:**
Scutellaria, peony, *kushen* (flavescent sophora), licorice, Chinese angelica, Sichuan pepper, *gansong* (spikenard, or *gandian*), indigo, realgar, and fermented soybeans—two *liang* each; eastward-growing peach root and scallions—one handful each; *guan* (washing basin)—one *ge*; musk—half a *fen*; and two pig gallbladders.
[Missing preparation method] Chop the ingredients, boil in one *dou* and eight *sheng* of water until reduced to four *sheng*, and divide into two doses. Irrigate with one dose at a time, ensuring the liquid is body-temperature. Then add musk and one pig gallbladder, and irrigate. After irrigation, consume scallion and fermented soybean porridge. The following day, administer the second dose in the same manner.
For seven days, avoid raw, cold, or toxic foods, as well as greasy foods, soy sauce, dairy, and vinegar. Observe these restrictions for thirty days for optimal results.

**Secret Formula for Gan Erosion in Any Part of the Body (Instantly Resolves Chronic Red-Bloody Dysentery):**
One dried toad (collected on the fifth day of the fifth month), burned to ash; human feces ash (or hair ash); five *liang* each of gold, silver, and clay crucibles; and musk the size of a small bean.
Grind the five ingredients into powder and sift. Apply to the sores, which will resolve immediately. Observe dietary restrictions for twenty-one days as previously described. For dysentery, insufflate into the lower body.

**Formula for Unremitting Gan Dysentery:**
*Kushen* (flavescent sophora), licorice, and realgar—two *liang* each; fermented soybeans—one *sheng* and a half; scallions—five stalks; and Sichuan pepper—thirty grains.
Grind the first three ingredients into powder and sift. Boil the scallions, fermented soybeans, and Sichuan pepper in five *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*. Add a three-finger pinch of each powdered ingredient to the decoction, adjusting the temperature to match the body. First, drink a small amount of the soybean liquid, eat a mouthful of rice, then lie on one side and slowly irrigate. Remain lying down for an extended period; retention is ideal. In urgent cases, expel the liquid in a secluded place. The expelled matter will resemble white horsehair with black heads—this confirms the formula’s efficacy.
For severe cases where the anus is greatly enlarged and difficult to cure, wrap a peach branch in silk and use the aforementioned decoction to cauterize near the spine, applying heat thirty times. This will resolve the condition with divine efficacy.

**Another Formula (from *Master Cui’s* text):**
The Jin territories were plagued by three types of gan, which eroded the five viscera, exposed the spine, discharged pus and blood, caused vexing pain in the hands and feet, weakened the limbs, induced nighttime restlessness, and led to blood loss and pallor. Shoulders and hips ached, the face and limbs swelled, and some died from bloody discharge. The following formula governs it:

**Realgar** (2 liang), **celosia seed** (2 liang), **flavescent sophora root** (3 liang), **alum** (1 liang), **orpiment** (1 liang), **iron rust** (1 liang), **false hellebore root** (1 liang), **musk** (2 fen, ground separately).

Grind the eight ingredients to a fine powder and sift. Using a bamboo tube, insert a quantity the size of a sour jujube into the large orifice, blowing it into the lower orifice once daily. Do not exceed three applications. For children, use a quantity the size of a soybean. This formula is highly effective in saving lives.

**Another Formula:**
**Hemp seed** (1.5 sheng), **sesame seed** (1.5 sheng).

Parch both ingredients until yellow. Place them in a three-sheng clay jar, coating the exterior with a one-cun layer of mud. Once the mud dries, fill the jar with the parched seeds. Insert four or five reed tubes into the mouth of the jar and seal tightly with mud. Dig a pit to form a furnace, invert the jar over the furnace mouth, and place a ceramic vessel beneath to collect the distillate. Pack the furnace opening tightly, level the ground, and pile charcoal around the jar. Ignite the charcoal at dusk and burn until dawn. Upon opening, adjust the distillate to a moderate temperature. For those afflicted with *gan*-damp, administer one *ge* into the lower orifice. If the patient soon senses the drug’s qi in the throat, the treatment is effective. Do not exceed the dosage, as excess may harm the patient. Administer every other day; for severe cases, apply two or three times. From morning to evening after the first application, the patient may feel extreme fatigue—this is normal. This remedy not only treats *gan*-damp but also cures various sores, scabies, and ringworm when used as a wash or topical application.

**Discourse:**
During solar or lunar eclipses, avoid eating or drinking. If one harbors *jie*-worms in the abdomen or engages in intercourse that results in an incomplete child, they will inevitably suffer from *moon-eclipse sores*. Such children must not be nursed by their elder sisters. After the eclipse, these restrictions no longer apply. Violations lead to foul breath, exposed tooth roots, constant bleeding gums, and sores on the tongue—all consequences of transgressing this prohibition.

If one fails to perform the requisite rituals during an eclipse and ventures out in a sudden storm, the staff used to "rescue" the moon must be retrieved, for it is a divine medicine for treating [missing text]—prepare it in advance for those afflicted.

**Formula for Moon-Eclipse Malignant Sores and Polyps:**
**Sulfur**, **bitter gourd root**, **blister beetle** (equal parts).

Grind the three ingredients to a fine powder and sift. Apply to the sores; if dry, mix with lard and apply three times daily and once at night.

**Another Formula:**
**Sanguisorba root**, **rose root**, **evodia root** (3 liang each).

Grind to a fine powder and sift. Wash the sores with saltwater decoction and apply the powder three times daily.

**Tenth Formula for Childhood Dysentery**
**Decoction to Warm the Center** treats children who, in summer, suffer from accumulated cold, excessive bathing, or cold baths taken by their wet nurses, followed by cold milk feeding. If the child suddenly encounters a violent storm while feverish, the cold exacerbates the condition, leading to watery diarrhea. With stomach weakness, the child’s face turns pale, flesh cools, eyes sink, and dry heaving occurs. This decoction should be administered first to regulate stomach qi, after which the diarrhea will cease.

**Ingredients:**
**Dried ginger** (1 fen), **magnolia bark** (1 fen), **Chinese angelica** (3 fen), **cassia twig** (3 fen), **licorice** (3 fen), **ginseng** (2 fen), **poria** (2 fen), **white atractylodes** (2 fen), **platycodon root** (2 fen).

Crush the nine ingredients, boil in two *sheng* of water, and reduce to nine *ge*. For infants sixty to one hundred days old, administer one dose of 2.5 *ge*; adjust dosage for older or younger children accordingly.

**Rhubarb Decoction to Warm the Center** treats children with sudden cold leading to undigested food in the stool; or cold milk causing green, clumped, undigested stools; or cold-induced vomiting, diarrhea, dry heaving, and restlessness; or cold stagnation resulting in red-and-white diarrhea.

If the child has already taken purgative decoctions to eliminate excess but the stomach remains weak and cold, with watery diarrhea, dry heaving, sunken eyes, and restlessness, *rhubarb* should be omitted. If the child’s condition stems from cold milk due to the wet nurse’s recent bath (water qi lingering), leading to cholera-like symptoms, use only *rhubarb*. For all childhood cholera cases requiring purgation, include *rhubarb*; if purgation is unnecessary and warmth is preferred, omit it.

**Ingredients:**
**Rhubarb** (6 fen), **cassia twig** (1 fen), **magnolia bark** (1 fen), **licorice** (1 fen), **dried ginger** (1 fen), **ginseng** (2 fen), **poria** (2 fen), **white atractylodes** (2 fen), **Chinese angelica** (2 fen), **platycodon root** (3 fen).

- For infants seventy to one hundred days old: one dose of 2.5 *ge*.
- For infants up to two hundred days old: one dose of 3 *ge*.

**Phellodendron Decoction** treats infants afflicted by sudden cold in summer, where cold suppresses intense heat, driving the heat into the stomach and causing red-white stagnation resembling fish brains, high fever, headache, generalized heat, and restless limbs. This arises from external injury to the Taiyang qi, where cold forces the heat inward into the stomach—this formula is highly effective. If mistakenly purged with draining medicines or warmed with Spleen-Warming Decoction, the heat will worsen. Purging with draining medicines may cause frequent passage of red fluid resembling rotted flesh. If purging fails to cure and the condition persists, use astringent-heat medicines to halt it. When purging does not cease and high fever intensifies, this formula will take effect immediately. For warm diseases with severe heat subsequently suppressed by sudden cold, driving heat into the abdomen and causing bloody stool resembling fish brains, this formula is highly effective:

**Ingredients:**
**Phellodendron** (2 fen), **coptis** (2 fen), **cimicifuga** (2 fen), **pulsatilla** (also called *bailian*) (2 fen), **Chinese angelica** (2 fen), **oyster shell** (2 fen), **pomegranate rind** (2 fen), **scutellaria** (2 fen), **mistletoe** (2 fen), **licorice** (2 fen), **rhinoceros horn** (1 fen), **mugwort leaf** (1 fen).

Crush the twelve ingredients, boil in 3 *sheng* of water, and reduce to 1.2 *sheng*.
- For infants one hundred to two hundred days old: one dose of 3 *ge*.
- For infants over two hundred days to one year old: one dose of 3.5 *ge*.

**Red Halloysite Pill** treats intestinal binding with cold stagnation, halting chronic red-white-green dysentery resembling fish brains, rectal prolapse, prolonged abdominal pain, and persistent discharge:

**Ingredients:**
**Red halloysite** (5 fen), **evodia fruit** (3 fen), **dried ginger** (2 fen), **aconite** (2 fen), **Chinese angelica** (2 fen), **magnolia bark** (2 fen), **white atractylodes** (2 fen), **magnolia bark** (2 fen), **pulsatilla** (2 fen), **coptis** (2 fen), **pomegranate rind** (2 fen), **phellodendron** (2 fen).

**Formulas for the Stomach Repository**
**On the Stomach Repository’s Pulse (First Discourse)**

The discourse states: The stomach repository governs the spleen. The lips serve as its external indicator. The spleen joins its *qi* with the stomach, which is the repository of water and grain, called the "granary steward guarding the inner treasury." It weighs two *jin* fourteen *liang*, winding and bending, measuring one *chi* six *cun* in length, one *chi* five *cun* in breadth, and five *cun* in diameter. It holds three *dou* five *sheng* of water and grain, of which two *dou* of grain and one *dou* five *sheng* of water should remain within. Broad and capacious, with a thick neck and expanded chest, it accommodates the five grains to fullness. The upper burner discharges *qi*, releasing its essence and subtle vitality—vigorous, swift, and smooth. The lower burner irrigates below, discharging into the various small intestines. Such are the quantities of water and grain the intestines and stomach receive.

In a healthy person, this is not so: when the stomach is full, the intestines are empty; when the intestines are full, the stomach is empty. Fullness and emptiness alternate, allowing *qi* to ascend and descend. The five viscera remain stable, the blood vessels harmonious and unobstructed, and the spirit abides. Thus, the spirit is the essence-*qi* of water and grain.

When the five viscera are insufficient, they are regulated by the stomach. Therefore, within the intestines and stomach, two *dou* four *sheng* of grain and one *dou* one *sheng* of water should remain. Hence, a person typically defecates twice daily (as depicted in the *Jiayi* diagrams), passing two and a half *sheng* each time—five *sheng* in a day. Over seven days, five times seven yields three *dou* five *sheng*, and the retained water and grain are exhausted. Thus, a healthy person who neither drinks nor eats for seven days will die, for the essence-*qi*, fluids, and humors of water and grain are entirely depleted, leading to death in seven days.

If the *yang* pulse at the *guan* position of the right hand is absent, there is no stomach pulse. If one experiences acid reflux and headache, cold is present in the stomach. Treat by needling the *Foot Greater Yin* to address *yin*, located one *cun* behind the base of the big toe.

If the *yang* pulse at the *guan* position of the right hand is replete, the stomach is replete. One suffers from rumbling in the intestines (alternate text: *fúfú*), loss of appetite, and inability to digest food after eating. Treat by needling the *Foot Yang Brightness* to address *yang*, located at the moving pulse on the foot.

If the pulse is floating and hollow, floating indicates *yang*, while hollowness indicates *yin*. When floating and hollow pulses contend, stomach *qi* generates heat, and its *yang* becomes exhausted.

If the *fuyang* pulse is floating and large, the stomach is slightly deficient, causing vexation. The bowels will move twice daily, and movement induces heaviness and headache. If heat *qi* arises in the morning, it pertains to the stomach.

If the stomach pulse is forceful and long with a reddish complexion, one will suffer from a fractured thigh. If it is rough and scattered, one will suffer from food blockage and thigh pain.

When disease first arises in the stomach, causing distension and fullness, it reaches the kidneys in five days, leading to lower abdominal, lumbar, and spinal pain, and aching sinews. In three days, it reaches the bladder, causing back, spine, and sinew pain, with urinary retention. In five days, it ascends to the heart and spleen, causing heart pain, blockage, and obstruction, along with generalized pain and heaviness (*Ling Gui* states it ascends to the heart). If unresolved in three days, death ensues—at midnight in winter or during the *die* hour in summer.

In stomach disease, the abdomen is distended, and the stomach duct pains at the heart, radiating to both flanks. The diaphragm and throat are obstructed, preventing food intake. Treat by needling *Sanli* below.

If food cannot descend and the diaphragm is obstructed, evil resides in the stomach duct. If in the upper duct, press and needle it; if in the lower duct, disperse and remove it.

In stomach distension, the abdomen is full, the stomach duct pains, and one smells a scorched odor through the nose, impairing appetite and causing difficult defecation.

In stomach malaria, one falls ill at dawn, experiences hunger but cannot eat, and after eating, suffers from propping fullness and abdominal distension. Treat by needling the *Foot Yang Brightness* and *Greater Yin* transverse vessels to draw blood.

If there is accumulation in the stomach and one eats cold food, pain prevents eating, but hot food can be consumed.

When the spleen’s disease transfers to the stomach, spleen cough persists, leading to vomiting of long worms.

If *reverting qi* lodges in the stomach, one dreams of eating and drinking.

When diagnosing the stomach pulse, what are the manifestations of its disease?
It is said: A replete stomach pulse causes distension; a deficient one causes diarrhea.

The spleen corresponds to the flesh. If the flesh is firm and large, the stomach is thick; if the flesh is flaccid, the stomach is thin; if the flesh is small and flaccid, the stomach is not firm; if the flesh does not match the body’s proportions, the stomach is sunken, and a sunken stomach causes constriction of the stomach duct. If the flesh is not firm, the stomach is slack; if the flesh has no small, clustered lumps, the stomach is tense; if the flesh has many small, clustered lumps, the stomach is knotted, and a knotted stomach causes constriction and dysfunction of the upper stomach duct.

Bian Que stated: The *Foot Greater Yin* and *Yang Brightness* are exterior and interior to each other. If the spleen and stomach are diseased, repletion injures with heat, and heat induces thirst for beverages. Deficiency injures with cold, and cold causes constant hunger and pain. When wind-water arises, its root lies in the stomach, beginning in the four limbs, causing abdominal fullness and generalized swelling. The formula is found in the *Treatise on Water* section.

If the stomach is exhausted, it is incurable, and death occurs in five days. How is this known? The tongue swells, urine contains blood, and stool is red and loose.

The *Foot Yang Brightness* vessel arises at the nose, intersecting at the *è* (bridge), bordering the *Greater Yang* vessel. It descends along the outer nose, enters the upper teeth, emerges to encircle the mouth, circles the lips, descends to intersect at *Chengjiang*, then follows the lower edge of the jaw to *Daying*, ascends along *Jiache* to the front of the ear, passes *Kezhuren*, follows the hairline, and reaches the forehead.

Its branch separates from *Daying*, descends anteriorly to *Renying*, follows the throat, enters the *quepen*, descends through the diaphragm, pertains to the stomach, and connects with the spleen.

Its straight branch descends from the *quepen* along the inner breast, passes beside the navel, and enters the *qijie*.

Another branch arises from the lower opening of the stomach, follows the abdomen, descends to the *qijie*, and converges. It then descends to the *bikuan*, reaches the *futu*, enters the knee cap, descends along the outer edge of the *heng*, enters the instep, and enters between the inner toes.

Another branch separates three *cun* below the knee and descends to enter between the outer toes.

Another branch enters the big toe from the instep and emerges at its tip.

When this vessel moves abnormally, one suffers from shivering cold, frequent stretching and yawning, and a dark complexion. The disease causes aversion to people and fire, and hearing wooden sounds induces fright and palpitations. One desires to close doors and windows and remain alone. In severe cases, one wishes to ascend heights and sing, discard clothing and run, experience rumbling and abdominal distension—this is called *shank reversal*.

The diseases arising from the blood governed by this vessel include manic malaria, warm excess, sweating, nasal congestion with nosebleed, wry mouth with tight lips, swollen neck and throat impediment, abdominal water swelling, swollen and painful knee cap, pain along the chest, breasts, *qi street*, thighs, *futu*, outer edge of the *heng*, and instep, with the middle toe unable to move.

When qi is abundant, the front of the body becomes entirely hot; if excess resides in the stomach, one digests grain quickly and is often hungry, with dark yellow urine. When qi is insufficient, the front of the body becomes entirely cold and shivering; if the stomach is cold, there is abdominal distension and fullness. In cases of excess, the *renying* pulse is three times larger than the *cunkou*; in deficiency, the *renying* pulse is smaller than the *cunkou*.

**Stomach Excess and Deficiency: Methods and Moxibustion**

**Stomach Excess Heat**
When the yang pulse at the right *guan* position is replete, it pertains to the Foot Yangming channel. The disease manifests with severe headache (in the *Mai Jing*: firm pain and heat in the abdomen), inability to sweat, symptoms resembling warm malaria, dry lips and mouth, frequent retching, breast abscess, swelling and pain in the supraclavicular fossa and under the armpit—this is called stomach excess heat.

**Decoction to Drain Stomach Heat**
Gardenia seed, *Belamcanda chinensis*, *Cimicifuga*, *Poria* (each three *liang*), Peony (four *liang*), White Atractylodes (five *liang*), Fresh Rehmannia juice, Red Honey (each one *sheng*).
Grind the first eight ingredients, boil in seven *sheng* of water until one and a half *sheng* remain, remove the dregs, add the Rehmannia juice, boil twice, then add honey, and boil until three *sheng* remain. Divide into three doses; adjust for the elderly and children as appropriate.

**Stomach Heat Disease**
Moxa *Sanli* (three *cun* below the knee) with thirty cones.

**Stomach Deficiency Cold**
When the yang pulse at the right *guan* position is deficient, it pertains to the Foot Yangming channel. The disease manifests with aversion to cold preventing sleep, shivering from wind and cold, eye tension, abdominal pain, deficient ringing in the ears (in the *Waitai*: ear ringing), alternating chills and fever, dry lips and mouth, facial and eye swelling—this is called stomach deficiency cold.

**Decoction to Supplement the Stomach**
Treats shortness of breath, bitter taste in the mouth, and lackluster complexion:
*Biota* seed, *Saposhnikovia*, *Asarum*, Cinnamon bark, Tangerine peel (each two *liang*), *Ligusticum*, *Evodia*, Ginseng (each three *liang*), Licorice (one *liang*).
Grind the nine ingredients, boil in one *dou* of water until three *sheng* remain, and divide into three doses.

**Ginseng Powder**
Supplements stomach deficiency cold, emaciation, and pain in all joints:
Ginseng, Licorice, *Asarum* (each six *fen*), *Ophiopogon*, Cinnamon bark, Chinese Angelica (each seven *fen*), Dried Ginger (two *liang*), *Polygala* (one *liang*), *Evodia* (two *fen*), Sichuan Pepper (three *fen*).
Grind into powder, take one square *cun* spoonful with warm wine after meals.

**Discourse on the Throat (Third)**

The throat serves as the indicator of the spleen and stomach. It weighs twelve *liang*, measures one *chi* and two *cun* in length, and two *cun* in width. Its layered structure, twelve in number, corresponds to the twelve hours, governing the passage of water and grain and the movement of spirit and qi.

If the viscera are hot, the throat swells and obstructs, preventing the passage of qi; treat with *Wu Yao* ointment (the formula is in the sixth scroll). If the bowels are cold, the throat feels obstructed as if by an object, with itching, numbness, and excessive saliva. For heat, open it; for cold, unblock it; if neither hot nor cold, regulate it according to the viscera (the formula is in the sixth scroll).

**Stomach Reflux (Fourth): Pulse, Methods, and Moxibustion**

When the *cun* pulse is tight and the *chi* pulse is rough, the person experiences chest fullness, inability to eat, and vomiting. If vomiting ceases, it indicates downward purging, hence the inability to eat. If vomiting has not ceased, this is stomach reflux, and the *chi* pulse becomes faintly rough.

When the *Fuyang* pulse is floating and rough, floating indicates deficiency, and roughness indicates spleen injury. Spleen injury prevents digestion, leading to morning ingestion and evening vomiting, evening ingestion and morning vomiting, with undigested food—this is called stomach reflux. If the *Fuyang* pulse is tight and rough, the disease is difficult to treat.

**Section Five: Vomiting and Hiccup – Pulse, Discussion, Formulas, and Moxibustion**

**Pulse in Vomiting Patients:**
In vomiting patients, the pulse resembles that of one recently arisen from sleep—yang tight and yin rapid. Such individuals vomit immediately after eating. A floating and rapid pulse also indicates vomiting.
A tight and hollow pulse at the *cunkou* signifies cold (tight) and deficiency (hollow). When cold and deficiency interact, the pulse becomes yin-bound and slow, leading to dysphagia.
A rapid pulse at the *guan* position indicates vomiting.
A faint and rough pulse at the *fuyang* position signifies diarrhea (faint) and vomiting with counterflow (rough), preventing food intake.
A floating pulse at the *fuyang* position indicates stomach qi deficiency, with cold qi above and depressed qi below. When these two qi contend, only outflow occurs without inflow, causing vomiting and inability to eat, with terror as if facing death. Recovery follows relaxation.

A weak pulse with vomiting, clear urination, slight fever, and cold limbs is difficult to treat.

**Discussion:**
When vomiting occurs after taking decoctions, preventing them from entering the abdomen, first boil three *liang* of Licorice in three *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, and ingest. If vomiting occurs, it is acceptable; if not, it is even better. Once stabilized, take the remaining decoction, which will flow smoothly without further vomiting.

A remedy for long-standing cold in the chest, counterflow qi, vomiting, and inability to ingest food or drink, with stagnant qi failing to disperse. *The Record of Ancient and Modern Verified Remedies* states: The five chokes are qi-choke, sorrow-choke, taxation-choke, food-choke, and contemplation-choke.
- **Qi-choke**: Palpitations, upper and lower blockage, incomplete belching or hiccups, and pain in the chest and flanks.
- **Sorrow-choke**: Cold inversion on cloudy days, palpitations below the heart, and counterflow cold in the hands and feet.
- **Taxation-choke**: Oppressive qi obstruction, fullness beneath the flanks, stuffiness in the chest, counterflow cold in the hands and feet, and inability to warm oneself.
- **Food-choke**: Regardless of meal size, persistent chest obstruction, constant pain, and inability to breathe freely.
- **Contemplation-choke**: Palpitations, forgetfulness, and blurred vision.

All arise from grief, anger, and cold qi ascending into the chest and flanks.

**Discourse**:
All treatments follow the principle of like addressing like. For instance, should one use a cormorant’s skull for bone choking or a leopard or tiger for fish choking? As for bamboo splints, scallion whites, chewed sinew, or honeyed silk—these may universally treat all choking.

**Remedy for All Choking**:
Soak deer sinew until supple, twist into a cord the size of a bullet, tie it with thread, and swallow the end. Push it to the choking site and gently pull; the obstruction will adhere and emerge.
**Alternative**: Fashion a bamboo splint, scrape it smooth, wrap it in silk, and insert it into the throat until reaching the obstruction. Gently advance and retract; the obstruction will follow and exit.
**Alternative**: Steep two *liang* of silk in honey, heat thoroughly, and apply externally to the obstruction site. Press a heated gourd against the silk. If the obstruction remains, replace with freshly heated silk. Additionally, blow a small amount of gleditsia powder into the nose to induce sneezing; the obstruction will exit.

*The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies* states: A remedy for choking persisting for a hundred days.
**Alternative**: Boil scallion whites until half-cooked, chew slightly, tie a thread to the center of a water bamboo shoot, grasp the thread, swallow the shoot, and guide it to the obstruction. Pull gently; the obstruction will exit.

Heat a bronze crossbow nut until red-hot, quench in wine, and drink. Instant relief.

**Remedy for Mistakenly Swallowed Nails, Needles, or Arrowheads**:
Consume ample fatty meat until full; the object will be enveloped and pass naturally.

**Remedy for Mistakenly Swallowed Needles**:
Take powdered lodestone, ingest one *fangcunbi* with water. It will descend.

**Seventh Treatise on Abdominal Distension: Remedies and Moxibustion**

The treatise states: When a patient’s abdomen is distended, if pressing causes no pain, it is deficiency; if pressing causes pain, it is excess.
For persistent abdominal fullness that does not diminish—or if it does, the reduction is imperceptible—this calls for purgation.
If the tongue is yellow and purgation has not been applied, purge; the yellow will resolve.
If abdominal fullness temporarily subsides but recurs, this is cold; warming medicinals are required.
For abdominal fullness with a bitter, dry mouth and water in the abdomen, this is *yin* (fluid retention).
If the *fuyang* pulse is faintly wiry, abdominal fullness is expected. If fullness is absent, there must be lower-body blockage, difficult defecation, and pain in both flanks. This is deficiency-cold *qi* ascending from below; administer warming medicinals to cure.
If abdominal fullness shifts and becomes painful, moving toward the lower abdomen, spontaneous diarrhea is imminent.

**Chapter Eight: On Cold Accumulation and Heat Binding**
**Formulas and Moxibustion Methods**

The treatise states: When a person is struck by cold, they frequently yawn, their nose runs clear mucus, they develop fever, and if their complexion remains harmonious, they sneeze readily. In diagnosing illness, before taking the pulse, observe the following: if the mouth is dry, clear mucus flows, and they sneeze and yawn frequently, this indicates cold strike. Such a person will have diarrhea due to *qi* deficiency in the interior. If they desire to sneeze but cannot, their abdomen will be painful. Generally, cold manifests as a deep and wiry pulse. A double-wiry pulse indicates cold. A wiry pulse resembles a drawn bowstring—firm and unyielding to pressure. A rapid and wiry pulse calls for purging the cold. A double-wiry and slow pulse indicates hardness below the heart. A large and tight pulse signifies *yang* containing *yin*—this may be purged.

If the pulse at the *cun* position of the right hand is wiry, there will be cramping pain below the ribs, and the person will feel chilled and uneasy. The master says: A slow pulse indicates cold; a rough pulse indicates blood deficiency. If the *cun* pulse is faint while the *chi* pulse is tight and rough, tightness signifies cold, faintness signifies deficiency—this indicates insufficiency of blood. Thus, one knows that sweating was followed by purging.

The *Lusuxu Pill* governs all cold diseases. The formula is found in Scroll Seventeen.

The *Xiongnu Lusuxu Pill* treats cold accumulations:
- Alum (2 *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (2 *liang*)
- Aconite (2 *liang*)
- Dried ginger (2 *liang*)

Grind the four ingredients into powder and form honey pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills three times daily, gradually increasing the dose.

The *Lusuxu Pill* treats encountering cold *qi*, binding tightness below the heart, counterflow vomiting, undigested cold food, and also governs cold damage or exposure to cold evil *qi* day or night:
- Aconite (4 *liang*)
- Sichuan aconite (4 *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (4 *liang*)
- Alum (4 *liang*)

Grind the four ingredients into powder and form honey pills the size of *hudou* beans. Take three pills with wine three times daily, increasing to ten pills. The medicine endures cold—avoid hot food and proximity to fire; cold food and drink are suitable.

**For Chronic Cold, Wind Dizziness, Cold Strike, Cold Hands and Feet, Stomach Cold, Cold Below the Navel, All Diseases, Five Taxations, and Seven Injuries:**
This formula first enables eating, then strengthens vitality, boosts *qi*, and promotes fertility—its efficacy is divine:
- Soybeans (3.5 *sheng*)
- Fresh rehmannia (15 *jin*; extract juice)
- Aconite (150 pieces)

On a *chu* day, crush the aconite, soak it in 1.5 *dou* of wine mixed with rehmannia juice until the *po* day, then strain out the bitter dregs. Place the soybeans in the medicinal juice until the next *chu* day, when they are removed and dried in the sun. If the juice remains, repeat the soaking and drying until the juice is exhausted and the medicine is complete. Begin by taking two soybeans, increasing to twenty, taken with wine. Those with illness should take it on an empty stomach; the healthy should take it after meals. It may be prepared in any season, though the second and third months are optimal. The medicine enables eating, boosts *qi*, strengthens vitality, promotes fertility, reverses gray hair to black, and causes fallen teeth to regrow. Those with prior heat illness should not take it.

**For Chronic Cold in the Heart and Abdomen, Unresponsive to All Treatments:**
- Fermented soybean powder (3 *sheng*)
- White atractylodes (5 *liang*)
- Dried ginger (3 *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (3 *liang*)
- Sichuan pepper (2 *liang*)
- Evodia fruit (2 *liang*)

Grind the six ingredients into powder. Take one square-inch spoonful with rice water twice daily. Within five doses, all cold conditions will be swiftly cured. Take on an empty stomach; no contraindications.

**For Chronic Cold Illness of Many Years:**
- Sichuan pepper (2 *liang*)
- Fermented soybeans (1 *sheng*)

Grind the Sichuan pepper into powder, mix with the soybeans, and pound three thousand times. Form pills the size of a bullet. Take one pill before meals with wine, twice daily.

**For Extreme Cold Where Physicians Have Failed:**
- *Malin* seeds (9 *sheng*; stir-fry and remove husks)

Take one *ge* on an empty stomach three times daily, with water or wine. After taking, eat something shortly thereafter. Continue until cured.

**The *Chi Pill* Treats Cold *Qi* Counterflow:**
- Poria (4 *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (4 *liang*)
- Asarum (1 *liang*)
- Aconite (2 *liang*)
- Sichuan aconite (2 *liang*)
- *Shewang* (equivalent to one large jujube; 1 *liang*)

Grind the six ingredients into powder, add realgar for color, and form honey pills the size of sesame seeds. Take one pill with wine on an empty stomach twice daily and once at night. If unresolved, increase to two pills, continuing until relief. One version uses four *liang* of pinellia instead of cinnamon.

**The *Banxia Decoction* Treats Chest Fullness with *Qi* and Cold in the Heart and Abdomen:**
- Pinellia (1 *sheng*)
- Cinnamon bark (4 *liang*)
- Fresh ginger (8 *liang*)

Crush the three ingredients, boil in seven *sheng* of water, and reduce to two *sheng*. Take seven *ge* per dose, three times daily.

**The *Fresh Ginger Decoction* Warms the Center and Descends *Qi*:**
- Fresh ginger (1 *jin*)
- Licorice (3 *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (4 *liang*)

Crush the three ingredients, boil in six *sheng* of water, and reduce to one and a half *sheng*. Take five *ge* per dose, three times daily.

**The *Licorice Decoction* Treats Deficiency Emaciation with Faint Breath on the Verge of Collapse:**
- Licorice (2 *liang*)
- Schisandra fruit (2 *liang*)
- Fresh ginger (2 *liang*)
- Evodia fruit (1 *sheng*)
- Ginseng (1 *liang*)

Here is the translation:

---

Crush the five ingredients, boil the *Evodia fruit* in four *sheng* of water until slightly simmering, strain the dregs, add the remaining ingredients, and boil to reduce to one *sheng* and six *ge*. Divide into two doses; taking several doses is beneficial.

**The *Evodia and Niter Decoction* Treats Chronic Cold with Loss of Appetite and Decades-Long Oblique Rheum:**
- Evodia fruit (8 *ge*)
- Niter (1 *sheng*)
- Fresh ginger (1 *jin*)

Steep the three ingredients in one *dou* of wine, dilute with water to make two *dou*, and boil to reduce to four *sheng*. Take two *sheng* per dose; once the illness is purged, do not take more. The initial discharge resembles rice-water, followed by foul mud or frothy dregs. If vomiting occurs, the decoction may be taken again. Nurse the patient as one would a nursing mother.

**The *Major Center-Fortifying Decoction* Treats Severe Cold and Pain in the Heart and Hypochondrium, Inability to Eat Due to Vomiting, and a Sensation of Food Descending Unilaterally with Gurgling Sounds:**
If cold *qi* in the abdomen surges upward, causing visible lumps with heads and limbs that move and cause pain, and the lumps are too tender to touch, use the following:
- Sichuan pepper (2 *ge*)
- Dried ginger (4 *liang*)
- Ginseng (2 *liang*)
- Malt sugar (1 *sheng*)

Crush the four ingredients, boil in four *sheng* of water, and reduce to two *sheng*. Strain the dregs, add the malt sugar, and simmer over a low flame to reduce to one and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses. After taking the decoction, wait the time it takes to cook three *sheng* of rice, then consume two *sheng* of congee. Take another dose afterward. The patient should eat gruel for a day and remain warmly covered.

**The *Rhubarb and Aconite Decoction* Treats Unilateral Hypochondriac Pain with Fever, a Tight and Wiry Pulse (Indicating Cold), and Requires Purging with Warming Medicinals:**
- Rhubarb (3 *liang*)
- Aconite (3 pieces)
- Asarum (2 *liang*)

Crush the three ingredients, boil in five *sheng* of water, and reduce to two *sheng*. Divide into two doses.

**Discourse:**
When the *cunkou* pulse is wiry and tight, a wiry pulse indicates stagnation of *wei qi*, which causes aversion to cold. A tight pulse leads to loss of appetite. When wiry and tight pulses interact, they produce cold *shan*. When the *fuyang* pulse is floating and slow, a floating pulse indicates wind and deficiency, while a slow pulse indicates cold *shan*. Generally, in emaciated individuals with periumbilical pain, there must be wind-cold, and if *gu qi* fails to move and is purged instead, the *qi* will surge upward. If it does not surge, there will be *pi* beneath the heart.

**The *Major Aconite Decoction* (Master Zhongjing’s *Two-Ingredient Aconite Brew*) Treats Cold *Shan* with Agonizing Periumbilical Pain, Spontaneous Sweating, Cold Extremities, and a Deep, Wiry Pulse:**
- Aconite (15 pieces, roasted black, uncut)

Steep in three *sheng* of water, boil to reduce to one *sheng*, strain the dregs, add two *jin* of white honey, and simmer until the water evaporates, yielding two *sheng*. Robust individuals take seven *ge* per dose; the frail take five *ge*. If the first dose is ineffective, take another the following day, but no more than one dose per day.

**The *Aconite and Cinnamon Twig Decoction* Treats Severe Cold *Shan* with Abdominal Pain, Counterflow Cold, Numbness of the Limbs, or Generalized Pain Unresponsive to Moxibustion or Acupuncture:**
- Autumn-harvested aconite kernels (5 pieces, with the tips removed)
- White honey (1 *jin*)

Simmer the aconite in honey until reduced by half, strain the dregs, and dissolve in five *ge* of *Cinnamon Twig Decoction* to make approximately one *sheng*. Initially take two *ge*; if the pain does not cease, take three *ge*, and if still unrelieved, increase to five *ge*. Cessation of pain will induce a drunken-like state, and vomiting indicates the illness has been struck. *(The* Cinnamon Twig Decoction *formula is found in the* Cold Damage *scroll.)*

*The* Essential Prescriptions *states: Boil cinnamon in two and a half* sheng *of water to make one* sheng*, then combine with the honey-aconite decoction and simmer to one* sheng *for consumption. It also states: The* Fan Wang Prescriptions *directs combining the preceding aconite brew with* Cinnamon Twig Decoction *for administration.*

**Discourse:**
In all cases of severe heat, the pulse must be examined. If the heat is extreme, one cannot rigidly adhere to standard formulas; the dosage must be adjusted according to the illness. For severe heat, the dosage may need to be doubled or tripled, or even increased tenfold to control it. Some suffer from unremitting heat due to *serving stone* (mineral drugs), and no amount of medicinals can suppress it—only the *Mirabilite Brew* can stabilize it. During the Wude reign, a nobleman named Shi Nunu called it *Metal-Stone Overwhelm*, which is incorrect. This formula requires only *two niters* (mirabilite and halite), *cold-water stone*, and *gypsum*—there is no need for gold. The inclusion of gold was an embellishment by the nobility.

**The *Mirabilite Brew*:**
- Mirabilite (1 *jin*)
- Glauber’s salt (8 *liang*)
- Cold-water stone (4 *liang*)
- Gypsum (2 *liang*)
- Gold (2 *liang*)

First dissolve the two niters in eight *sheng* of hot water, stir until dissolved, seal tightly with paper overnight, and decant the clear liquid into a copper vessel. Separately pound the *cold-water stone* and *gypsum* into pea-sized pieces, place them in a silk bag, and steep in the liquid. Simmer over a low flame until foam rises; test with chopsticks—if the foam congeals like snowflakes, immediately pour into a basin and allow to solidify. Remove and dry in strong sunlight. For those suffering from unremitting heat and oppression, take one *fangcunbi* with one *ge* of white honey and five *ge* of cold water, stir until dissolved, and consume in one dose, three times daily. Discontinue once the heat subsides.

**Formulas for the Lung**

**Discourse on the Lung’s Pulse (First Section)**

The Discourse states: The lung governs the *po* (corporeal soul). The *po*-viscus is the essence that receives external things, serving as the "supreme general" stationed above to govern ascent. Thus, the lung is the canopy of the five viscera.

The entry and exit of essence are called *po*, and the *po* is the repository of the lung. The nose is the lung’s official; the lung’s *qi* communicates with the nose, and when the nose is harmonious, it can distinguish fragrance from foulness.

Its pathways circulate through the Purple Palace, ascend to the cheeks, manifest below the nose, return to the lung, flourish in the hair, externally govern *qi*, and internally govern the chest, corresponding to the breasts—left breast to *geng* (Metal-Yang), right breast to *xin* (Metal-Yin). The lung weighs three *jin* and three *liang*, with six lobes and two ears, totaling eight lobes. Fourteen boys and seven girls guard it, and its spirit is named *Honghong*.

It stores the *po*, hence called the *po*-viscus. Adapting to seasonal nodes, it is said: "The lung stores *qi*, and *qi* harbors the *po*." In *qi*, it manifests as cough; in fluids, as nasal mucus.

When lung-*qi* is deficient, the nasal passages are unobstructed yet breath is scant; when replete, there is panting, wheezing, and chest distension with labored breathing.

Deficient lung-*qi* causes dreams of white objects or scenes of slaughter with bloodshed; when aligned with its season, dreams of warfare arise. Exuberant *qi* induces dreams of terror, weeping, and lamentation.

If perverse *qi* invades the lung, one dreams of soaring, encountering metal implements or strange objects.

The lung corresponds to Metal and pairs with the large intestine as its *fu*-organ. Its channel is the Hand Greater Yin, externally-internally linked with the Yang Brightness. Its pulse is floating, associated with late summer, and flourishes in autumn.

Autumn is the season when all things conclude—withered leaves fall from branches, and bare twigs stand solitary. Its pulse is slightly floating: *wei*-*qi* slows, *ying*-*qi* quickens. Quickening resides above, slowing below, hence called "hair."

When Yang should descend but fails, or Yin should ascend but cannot, the two *qi* clash, allowing wind-cold to invade. If Yang is afflicted, the pulse curls; if Yin is afflicted, it tightens. Curling induces aversion to cold; tightening causes shivering. When cold and shivering contend, it is called malaria.

Weakness induces fever; floating indicates emergence. If onset occurs at dawn, it strikes at dawn; if at dusk, it strikes at dusk. Viscera have proximity and distance; pulses have slowness and rapidity. Cycles have measurements; movements have time divisions. Slowness above injures the exterior; rapidity below harms the lower burner.

If the middle burner harbors evil, it manifests; if benign, it conceals. When Yang-*qi* descends, Yin-*qi* warms. If Yang reverses below and Yin reverses above, it is called "prolonged and lingering."

The autumn pulse is floating—the lung’s pulse, corresponding to the West and Metal. All things gather and ripen, so its *qi* arrives light, vacuous, and floating, coming urgently and scattering swiftly—hence called "floating." Its contrary indicates illness.

What constitutes its contrary? If its *qi* arrives like hair but is firm in the center with vacuity at the sides, this is called "excess," and the illness lies externally. If its *qi* arrives faint like hair, this is called "insufficiency," and the illness lies internally.

Excess causes *qi* counterflow with back pain and vexing heat. Insufficiency induces panting, shortness of breath, coughing, counterflow *qi*, blood expectoration, and audible pathological sounds below.

A normal lung pulse arrives gently, like falling elm seeds—this is the lung’s harmony, with stomach-*qi* as its foundation.

A lung pulse arriving neither ascending nor descending, like stroking a chicken’s feather, indicates lung disease. (*Source of Pathogens* omits "not.")

A lung pulse arriving like a floating object or wind-blown hair indicates mortal lung disease.

When the true lung pulse arrives, it is large and vacuous, like feathers brushing the skin. The complexion is white-red without luster, and when body hair withers, death ensues.

In autumn, a pulse with slight hair-like quality and stomach-*qi* is normal. Predominantly hair-like with scant stomach-*qi* indicates lung disease. Hair-like without stomach-*qi* is fatal. Hair-like with string-like quality foretells spring illness; pronounced string-like quality indicates imminent illness.

The lung stores *qi* and harbors the *po*. Excessive joy and pleasure injure the *po*; when the *po* is injured, mania ensues. The manic disregard others, their skin withers, body hair wilts, and complexion fades—they die in summer.

When the Hand Greater Yin’s *qi* is severed, skin and body hair wither. The Greater Yin governs the circulation of *qi* to warm skin and body hair. If *qi* fails to nourish, skin and body hair wither; when they wither, fluids depart. Fluid loss injures skin and joints; when skin and joints are injured, nails (or skin) desiccate and body hair withers. When body hair withers, *qi* dies first—*bing* (third Heavenly Stem) hastens, *ding* (fourth Heavenly Stem) brings death, as Fire overcomes Metal.

When the lung is a dead viscus, its pulse is vacuous upon light touch and weak upon pressure, like an onion leaf without root—this is fatal.

In autumn, when Metal and the lung flourish, a slightly rough and short pulse is normal. If it is instead large and moderate, this is the spleen overacting on the lung, the mother returning to the child—a vacuous evil, though ill, easily treated.

If it is instead deep, soft, and slippery, this is the kidney overacting on the lung, the child overwhelming the mother—a replete evil, though ill, self-resolving.

If it is instead floating, large, and surging, this is the heart overacting on the lung, Fire overcoming Metal—a thieving evil, a grave reversal; ten deaths, no cure.

If it is instead string-like, fine, and long, this is the liver overacting on the lung, Wood encroaching on Metal—a minor evil, though ill, swiftly healing.

When the liver overacts on the lung, it must manifest as vacuity.

If the Yin pulse at the inch position before the right bar is severed, there is no lung pulse. If accompanied by shortness of breath, cough with counterflow, throat obstruction, and belching, needle the Hand Yang Brightness to treat Yang.

If the Yin pulse at the inch position before the right bar is replete, the lung is replete. One suffers from scant *qi*, fullness and distension in the chest, and tension extending to the shoulders—needle the Hand Greater Yin to treat Yin.

When the lung pulse arrives, it is light and floating, like a gentle breeze brushing the feathers on a crow’s back. Arriving twice is normal; thrice indicates channel disease; four times, essence depletion; five times, death; six times, life’s end—this is the Hand Greater Yin pulse.

An extremely tense lung pulse causes epilepsy; slight tension induces lung cold-heat, lassitude, coughing with blood, and pulling pain in the waist, back, and chest, or nasal polyps causing obstruction.

An excessively slack lung pulse causes profuse sweating; slight slackness induces atrophy, *loufeng* (or *pianfeng*), and uncontrollable sweating from the head downward. An extremely large pulse indicates channel swelling; slight largeness indicates lung impediment, with pulling pain in the chest and back extending to the inner waist. An extremely small pulse causes *sūnxiè*; slight smallness induces *xiāodàn*. An extremely slippery pulse causes *xīpèn* and counterflow *qi*; slight slipperiness induces bleeding from the upper and lower orifices. An extremely rough pulse causes blood vomiting; slight roughness induces *shǔlòu*, appearing between the neck, limbs, and armpits, where the lower cannot overcome the upper, and one craves sour flavors.

When the lung pulse is forceful, firm, and long, one will suffer from blood-spitting. If it is soft and scattered, one will suffer from *lòu* (or *guàn*) sweating, which will not disperse even now. When the white pulse arrives, it is panting and floating, with upper vacuity and lower repletion, causing fright and accumulation of *qi* in the chest. Panting with vacuity is called lung impediment, with alternating cold and heat, contracted from drunkenness followed by sexual activity.

The Yellow Emperor asked: Of the twelve channels, why does only the Hand Greater Yin pulse move without cease?
The Hand Greater Yin originates in the inch opening.
Qibo replied: The Foot Yang Brightness is the stomach channel. The stomach is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels. The stomach channel lies between the great toe and the instep, ascending three *cun* to the bone junction. Its essence-*qi* ascends and clears, pouring into the lung, and the lung *qi* follows the Greater Yin in its circulation. Its movement corresponds to the rhythm of breathing, so with each exhalation the pulse moves twice, and with each inhalation it also moves twice. As breathing does not cease, the pulse does not stop.

The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does the *qìkǒu* alone govern the five viscera?
Qibo said: The stomach is the sea of water and grain. Among the six bowels, the stomach is the largest. The five flavors enter the mouth and are stored in the stomach to nourish the *qi* of the five viscera. The *qìkǒu* is the Greater Yin; the *qi* and flavors of the viscera and bowels all issue from the stomach and manifest at the *qìkǒu*. The *qìkǒu* pertains to the bowels and governs the viscera—this is what is called the *cùnkǒu*.

Bian Que said: When the lung is diseased, the nose and mouth open wide; with repletion heat, there is panting counterflow and propped-up breathing. If its Yang *qi* is robust, one dreams of terror and fear. With vacuity cold, there is coughing, panting, diarrhea, and scant *qi*. If its Yin *qi* is robust, one dreams of wading through water.

The lung corresponds in sound to weeping, in movement to coughing, and in emotion to sorrow. Sorrow damages the lung; when essence-*qi* converges in the lung, one feels grief. Its flavor governs autumn. When binding fullness and blood are present, the disease lies in the chest, or it may arise from dietary irregularities—treat at the *hé* points, hence it is said that flavor governs the *hé*.

When disease first arises in the lung, there is panting and coughing. After three days, it reaches the liver, causing rib-side pain and propping fullness. After one day, it reaches the spleen, causing blockage and obstruction, bodily pain, and heavy limbs. After five days, it reaches the stomach, causing abdominal distension. If ten days pass without resolution, death ensues—at dusk in winter, at dawn in summer.

When disease is in the lung, clarity comes at late afternoon, severity at midday, and stillness at midnight. If lung disease is contracted from traveling south or eating horse or roebuck meat, or if not, it will erupt in summer, with onset on *bǐng-dīng* days—red medicinals are suitable.

In general, lung disease manifests as panting, coughing, counterflow *qi*, shoulder panting, back pain, sweating, cramping of the buttocks, private parts, thighs, knees, and calves, and pain in the hip joints, shanks, and feet. With vacuity, there is scant *qi* and inability to catch one’s breath, deafness, and dry throat—treat the Hand Greater Yin and Foot Greater Yang channels externally, and the Ceasing Yin and Lesser Yin channels internally, where the blood is.

When the lung pulse is deep and rapid, or floating and panting, one suffers from shivering cold and heat, abdominal fullness, heat in the intestines, red urine, shoulder and back pain, sweating from the waist upward, contracted from sexual activity followed by exposure to wind.

In lung disease, the complexion is white, the body is only cold without heat, and there is frequent coughing. If the pulse is slightly slow, it is treatable—suitable formulas include *Schisandra Great Supplementation Decoction* and *Drain the Lung Powder*. In spring, needle *Lesser Shang*; in summer, *Fish Border*—both to drain. In late summer, needle *Great Abyss*; in autumn, *Channel Ditch*; in winter, *Cubit Marsh*—all to supplement.

One should also apply moxibustion at *Shanzhong* (CV 17) with one hundred cones and at the third thoracic vertebra with twenty-five cones. When pathogenic qi resides in the lung, the skin aches, cold shivering arises, qi surges upward causing panting, sweating, and coughing that agitates the shoulders and back. Select the outer transport points on the chest and the points beside the third thoracic vertebra—when pressed with the hand, if the patient feels relief, then needle them. Also needle *Quepen* (ST 12) to disperse the pathogen.

Cold in form and cold drinks injure the lung, for the two colds interact, harming both interior and exterior, thus causing qi to rebel and ascend. When the lung is injured, exertion leads to coughing and spitting of blood. If the pulse is fine, tight, floating, or rapid, all indicate spitting of blood, resulting from restlessness, anger, or lung injury with qi obstruction.

When wind invades the lung, the mouth becomes dry and panting ensues, the body feels heavy and dizzy, and swelling occurs. When cold invades the lung, the person experiences abdominal rumbling. In lung water disease, the body swells and urination is difficult, sometimes with sudden urges, and the stool resembles duck droppings. In lung distension, there is emptiness and fullness, panting and coughing, with a sensation as if the moon were about to fall. The pulse is floating and large.

When the *Fuyang* pulse is floating and moderate, and the *Shaoyang* pulse is slightly tight, slight tightness indicates blood deficiency, while tightness suggests mild cold—this is *shuru* (nodular skin lesions). Upon diagnosis of lung accumulation, the pulse is floating and hair-like; when pressed, it scatters and evades. There is intermittent pain below the ribs, radiating to the back, shortness of breath, forgetfulness, blurred vision, abscess formation, cold skin, and improvement in autumn but worsening in summer. The skin intermittently aches, as if insects were crawling, or in severe cases, as if pricked by needles, sometimes itching, with a white complexion.

The lung accumulation is called *Xiben*, located beneath the right rib, covering an area as large as a cup. If unresolved for long, it causes alternating chills and fever, qi counterflow, panting, coughing, and lung abscess. It is contracted on *jia-yi* days of spring. Why? When heart disease transmits to the lung, the lung should transmit to the liver, but the liver is in its ascendant phase during spring. The ascendant organ does not receive pathogens, so the lung attempts to return the pathogen to the heart, which refuses it. Thus, the pathogen lingers and forms an accumulation—hence *Xiben* is contracted in spring.

In lung disease, the body should have heat, coughing, shortness of breath, and spitting of pus and blood, with a pulse that should be short and rough. If the pulse is instead floating and large, and the complexion should be white but is instead red, this indicates fire overwhelming metal—a grave reversal, with no chance of survival.

Those of the *Shang* tone belong to the lung’s sound, which is weeping. Its note is like a chime stone, its emotion is joy, and its channel is the Hand Greater Yin. When yang brightness is in counterflow, the constructive and defensive qi fail to circulate, yin and yang reverse their positions, yang qi strikes internally, and yin qi is injured externally. Injury leads to cold, cold to deficiency, and deficiency to vulnerability to severe wind, causing shivering, trembling, hoarse and scattered speech, short and exhausted breath, weakness in the limbs, a bluish-green complexion, and involuntary loss of stool and urine. In severe cases, it is incurable, but *Ephedra Continuing Life Decoction* governs it. The formula is found in the eighth scroll.

It is also said that when the voice is panting and urgent, with shortness of breath and frequent spitting, this indicates fire overwhelming metal, yang striking yin, yin qi sinking, and yang qi rising. Rising leads to repletion, repletion to heat, heat to madness, madness to closed eyes, palpitations, and incoherent speech. The mouth is red and gaping, with no regularity in drinking—this is heat injuring the lung, transforming it into blood, and is incurable. If the face is red but the nose is not crooked, it is treatable.

When lung disease manifests as malaria, it causes the person to feel cold in the heart. Severe cold gives way to heat, and during the heat phase, there is frequent fright, as if seeing something. *Dichroa Decoction* governs this. The formula is found in the tenth scroll.

If a person’s voice was originally strong and resonant but suddenly becomes faint, requiring effort to speak, differing from their usual state, and when called or spoken to, they stare blankly without responding—though not yet ill, their condition will not last long. This is the sign of lung disease in the voice. In examining illness, when the exterior and interior correspond, and one investigates the source to administer treatment, nothing is missed.

White corresponds to the lung, which governs the skin. A white complexion like lard is auspicious. The lung governs the nose, which is the lung’s surplus. Those of the metal constitution resemble the *Shang* tone above: white complexion, small head, square face, small shoulders and back, small abdomen, small hands and feet, light and agile body, keen and upright, quick-minded yet calm, and inclined toward officialdom. They endure autumn and winter but not spring and summer; if affected in spring and summer, they fall ill. They govern the Hand Greater Yin.

If the shoulders and chest are upright and balanced in thickness, the lung responds accordingly. A pure white complexion with fine texture indicates a small lung; small lungs drink little and do not suffer from panting or thirst. Coarse texture indicates a large lung; large lungs are deficient, deficient lungs are cold, causing panting, wheezing, excessive drinking, and susceptibility to chest and throat blockage with counterflow qi. If the shoulders are broad, the chest protrudes, and the throat is sunken, the lung is high; high lungs are replete, replete lungs are hot, causing upward qi, shoulder breathing, and cough with counterflow. If the armpits are closed and the ribs are flared, the lung is low; low lungs press upon the *ben* (stomach) and oppress the liver, causing frequent pain below the ribs, nasal congestion, or obstruction with snivel, and the growth of polyps. If the shoulders and back are thick, the lung is firm; firm lungs do not suffer from cough or upward qi. If the shoulders and back are thin, the lung is fragile; fragile lungs are easily injured by heat, causing panting and nosebleeds. If the shoulders and chest are well-formed, the lung is upright; upright lungs are harmonious, beneficial, and difficult to injure. If the chest is uneven, the lung is slanted; slanted lungs cause pain in one side of the chest, and the nose is also afflicted on one side.

All people have areas of depression and elevation in their bodily regions, which necessarily give rise to disease. The yang brightness of the large intestine is the lung’s domain, and the visceral qi communicate between interior and exterior, so the domain also responds accordingly. The deep and turbid pertain to the interior, the floating and clear to the exterior. If an external disease enters the interior, the domain becomes elevated; if an internal disease emerges outward, the domain becomes depressed. When an external disease enters, first treat the yang, then the yin; when an internal disease emerges, first treat the yin, then the yang—drain the replete and supplement the deficient.

The yang governs the exterior, the yin governs the interior. In all matters of life, death, fortune, or misfortune, the visceral spirits first manifest changes in form externally. When the lung is initially diseased, the nose becomes parched and dry with open pores. If the lung is on the verge of death, the nose’s bridge collapses, its pores close, and its color turns dark and black. Should the color of the celestial center and its corresponding regions match the hue of the tomb, death is certain and untreatable. Assess the depth of the color to gauge whether the condition is chronic or acute—if distant, death will not occur within a year; if acute, it will not extend beyond the month. How can one know if a lung ailment has slightly improved only to result in sudden death? It is said: if a blackish-red mark like a thumbprint appears on the cheek, sudden death is certain. The lung expires after three days—how can one know? The mouth gapes open, exhaling without inhalation, the face turns white, and the eyes green—this is called "disordered channels." Drinking wine while exposed to wind allows wind to enter the lung channel, causing reckless discharge of gallbladder qi, turning the eyes green. Even with heavenly intervention, life cannot be restored. A face yellow and eyes white as dry bone foretell death.

Fortune and misfortune are revealed in the divisions of the facial regions. If colors appear in proper sequence, red and white entering the nose foretell illness within the year. If no affliction arises in that time, calamity will strike within three years. In autumn, the lung’s qi is white, corresponding to the hand greater yin channel. In autumn, one selects the channel’s transport points. Autumn is when metal begins its governance, the lung prepares to gather and restrain, metal overcomes fire, yang qi resides in the uniting points, and yin qi begins its ascendancy. Damp qi assails the body, but yin qi is not yet dominant and cannot penetrate deeply. Thus, one selects the transport points to drain yin evil and the uniting points to deplete yang evil. As yang qi begins to wane, one selects the uniting points.

The root of this channel lies in the middle of the inch-opening, two inches between the two tendons behind the palm, corresponding to the pulsating artery beneath the armpit. Its root originates at the Great Granary, located three inches above the navel—one handbreadth. Its sinews begin above the thumb, ascend along the finger, bind behind the thenar eminence, run along the outer side of the inch-opening, ascend the arm, bind at the elbow, follow the inner upper arm, enter beneath the armpit, emerge above the supraclavicular fossa, bind in front of the shoulder joint, ascend to bind at the supraclavicular fossa, descend to bind within the chest, disperse and penetrate beneath the diaphragm, and reach the lower ribs.

The channel arises in the middle burner, descends to connect with the large intestine, circles back along the stomach’s opening, ascends through the diaphragm to connect with the lung. From the lung’s system, it extends horizontally beneath the armpit, descends along the inner upper arm, passes in front of the hand lesser yin and heart governor channels, descends to the elbow, follows the inner lower edge of the arm’s upper bone, enters the inch-opening, ascends to the thenar eminence, and emerges at the thumb’s tip. Its branch separates from the wrist’s posterior, runs directly to the index finger’s inner edge, and emerges at its tip. It pairs with the hand yang brightness as exterior and interior.

The root of the yang brightness lies in the elbow’s bone, converging with the hand greater yin. The greater yin’s divergence is called *Lieque*, arising in the space beneath the armpit, paralleling the greater yin’s channel to enter the palm, dispersing into the thenar eminence, and branching to the hand yang brightness. It governs lung-generated diseases. When the disease is replete, the large intestine becomes hot; heat causes the hand’s *Dui* and palm to rise, and rising causes yang disease. If the yang pulse is three times greater than the inch-opening’s pulse, the disease manifests as coughing, ascending qi, panting, thirst, vexation, fullness in the chest, pain along the inner front of the upper arm, and heat in the palm. When qi is abundant and excessive, the shoulders and back ache from wind, sweating, and wind strike. When deficient, the large intestine becomes cold; cold causes yawning and coughing. Frequent urination indicates yin disease. If the yin pulse is half the size of the inch-opening’s pulse, the disease manifests as cold pain in the shoulders and back, shortness of breath, insufficient qi for respiration, hollow pain in the lower ribs, altered urine color, and sudden involuntary loss of stool.

The three months of autumn govern the lung and large intestine, and the white qi *li* disease. Its origin lies in the greater yang striking the hand greater yin; when the greater yin receives the excess evil qi, the channels and network vessels become congested, and the skin and hair tighten. If the evil is discharged, the viscera and bowels are harmed by warmth, and as autumn receives the pestilence, the disease reverses. If the bowel is deficient, it is harmed by yin evil, causing alternating chills and fever, damaging the lung and injuring qi, leading to sudden coughing and retching. If the viscus is replete, it is harmed by yang toxin, generating heat and rashes, panting, and excessive thirst—this is called the white qi *li* disease. Bian Que said: moxibustion at the heart and lung transport points treats cinnabar toxin and white *li* disease. One should treat according to its origin, harmonizing the yang and regulating the yin, so that diseases of the viscera and bowels do not arise.

**Lung Deficiency and Repletion: Second Pulse and Formula**
**Moxibustion Method**

**Lung Repletion Heat**
If the yin pulse at the inch-opening of the right hand is replete, it pertains to the hand greater yin channel. The disease manifests as lung distension, sweating like dew, ascending qi, panting, and counterflow, with the throat obstructed as if about to retch—this is called lung repletion heat.

**Lung Viscera Remedies: Qi Exhaustion, Fourth Treatise**

**Remedies, Moxibustion Methods, and Discourse**

It is said: All cases of *qi* exhaustion are governed by the lungs. The lungs correspond to *qi*, and *qi* unites with the lungs. It is further said: When one encounters illness in autumn, it becomes *skin impediment* (皮痹). If *skin impediment* persists and one is again afflicted by pathogenic *qi*, it lodges internally in the lungs, allowing the cold-damp *qi* to invade the six *fu*-viscera.

If the lungs are diseased, the first sign is *qi* surging upward into the chest, with a constant urge to self-reproach. When, on *geng* or *xin* days in autumn, one is harmed by wind-evil *qi*, it becomes *lung wind*. The symptoms of *lung wind* include profuse sweating. If *yin* is damaged, cold arises; cold leads to vacuity, and vacuity causes *qi* counterflow and coughing. Coughing results in shortness of breath, which worsens at dusk when *yin qi* arrives and damp *qi* is generated—hence the severity. *Yin* fears *yang qi*, so symptoms abate during the day. If *yang* is damaged, heat arises; heat leads to repletion, and repletion causes *qi* to pant and rise into the chest and bosom. In severe cases, one spits blood.

Now, when *yang* is diseased, treat *yin*, for *yin* is its interior. When *yin* is diseased, treat *yang*, for *yang* is its exterior. Thus, *yin* and *yang*—exterior and interior—are the roots of decline and flourishing. Therefore, one must know to regulate *yin* with *yang* and *yang* with *yin*: when *yang qi* is replete, drain it; when *yin qi* is vacuous, supplement it.

The skilled physician treats illness at its onset, when it has only entered the skin, hair, flesh, sinews, or vessels. If it reaches the six *fu*-viscera or five *zang*-viscera, recovery is half impossible.

Bian Que said: When *qi* is cut off and untreatable, with panting (or *running*) and cold sweats, death occurs in two days. *Qi* corresponds to the hand *Taiyin*; when *Taiyin qi* is cut off, the skin and hair wither, and *qi* perishes first.

**Fifth Discourse on Qi Accumulations**
**Formulas and Moxibustion**

It is said: The seven *qi* are cold *qi*, heat *qi*, anger *qi*, resentment *qi*, joy *qi*, sorrow *qi*, and grief *qi*—seven types in all.
When they form accumulations, these become hard masses the size of a cup or plate beneath the heart or in the abdomen, causing acute pain, inability to eat, and intermittent attacks that feel life-threatening, as if haunted by malevolent spirits. All arise from the seven *qi*.

**Lung Viscus Formulae**
**On Qi Exhaustion (Fourth Discussion)**

**Formulae**
**Moxibustion**

It is said: All cases of *qi* exhaustion are governed by the lung. The lung corresponds to *qi*, and *qi* unites with the lung.

It is also said: When illness is contracted in autumn, it becomes *skin impediment*. If *skin impediment* persists and is again assailed by pathogenic *qi*, it lodges internally in the lung, allowing cold-damp *qi* to invade the six *fu*.

If the lung is diseased, *qi* will first surge upward into the chest, and the patient will frequently desire to sigh. When wind-pathogen *qi* injures the metal days of autumn (geng and xin), it becomes *lung wind*. The symptoms of *lung wind* include profuse sweating. If *yin* is damaged, cold arises; cold leads to deficiency, deficiency to *qi* counterflow and cough; cough to shortness of breath, which worsens at dusk when *yin qi* arrives and damp *qi* arises—thus the exacerbation. *Yin* fears *yang qi*, so symptoms abate by day.

If *yang* is damaged, heat arises; heat leads to repletion, repletion to *qi* panting and gasping in the upper chest, and in severe cases, to blood-spitting. Now, *yang* disease is treated through *yin*, for *yin* is its interior; *yin* disease is treated through *yang*, for *yang* is its exterior. Thus, *yin* and *yang*—exterior and interior—are the root of decline and flourishing. Therefore, one knows to regulate *yin* with *yang* and *yang* with *yin*: when *yang qi* is replete, drain it; when *yin qi* is deficient, tonify it.

The skilled physician treats illness when it first enters the skin, hair, flesh, sinews, and vessels. If it reaches the six *fu* and five *zang*, half the patient is already dead.

Bian Que said: When *qi* is cut off and untreatable, with panting (or *running piglet*) and cold sweating, death occurs in two days. *Qi* corresponds to the hand *Taiyin*; when *Taiyin qi* is cut off, the skin and hair wither, and *qi* dies first.

**Formulas**
**Moxibustion Methods**

It is said: The seven *qi* are cold *qi*, heat *qi*, anger *qi*, resentment *qi*, joy *qi*, worry *qi*, and sorrow *qi*—altogether seven kinds of *qi*.
When accumulations and gatherings form, hard as a cup or plate, located below the heart and in the abdomen, causing acute pain and inability to take food, coming and going unpredictably, with each onset bringing near-death agony as if afflicted by malevolent spirits, these are all born of the seven *qi*.

Lung Viscera Formulas
Sixth Discourse on *Feiwei* and Prescriptions

The discourse states: When the *cunkou* pulse is rapid, and the patient suffers from coughing with turbid spittle and frothy saliva unexpectedly issuing from the mouth, what is the cause?

The Master replies: This is the disease of *feiwei* (pulmonary atrophy). How does one contract it?

The Master replies: When heat resides in the upper burner, coughing may lead to *feiwei*. It may arise from profuse sweating, or from vomiting, or from painful thirst with frequent urination, or from difficult defecation. Repeated purgation with drastic medicines severely depletes the body fluids, thus giving rise to *feiwei*.

Moreover, when the *cunkou* pulse fails to emerge and yet sweating is induced, the yang pulse is prematurely exhausted while the yin pulse remains unobstructed. The three burners stagnate, with qi entering but failing to exit. Though the yin pulse is unobstructed, the body feels cold, while internally there is vexation, copious spittle, dry lips, and difficulty in urination. This is *feiwei*, wherein the fluids are damaged, the flesh becomes as rotten melon, and the discharge resembles pig’s brain—all due to improper sweating.

The disease manifests as a desire to cough without being able to do so, or coughing up dry froth. Over time, urination becomes difficult, and the pulse is moderate and weak.

In *feiwei* where the patient expectorates frothy saliva without coughing, if the person is not thirsty, there will inevitably be enuresis and frequent urination. The reason is that the upper [burner] is deficient and unable to restrain the lower, indicating cold in the lungs, which must cause dizziness.

The Master says: In *feiwei* with coughing and spittle, if the throat is dry and the patient desires to drink, spontaneous recovery will follow. If the mouth is held open, it indicates shortness of breath.

**Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction** warms the viscera and treats *feiwei* with copious frothy saliva, frequent urination, cold in the lungs, and dizziness. If there is no thirst or cough, or if thirst is present, it pertains to the method for painful thirst. The upper [burner] is deficient, and the lower [burner] cannot be restrained. After taking this decoction, cover the patient lightly to induce warmth.

**Seventh Discourse on *Feitan* (Pulmonary Abscess) and Prescriptions**

The discourse states: When a patient coughs up pus and blood with a rapid pulse, a replete pulse indicates *feitong* (pulmonary abscess), while a deficient pulse indicates *feiwei*.

If coughing is accompanied by spontaneous saliva in the mouth and a slippery tongue coating, this is due to superficial cold and is not *feiwei*. If the mouth is parched and dry, coughing causes dull pain in the chest, and the pulse is slippery and rapid, this is *feitong*.

Question: When a patient suffers from cough with counterflow qi, and the Master examines the pulse, how can one determine it is *feitong*? There should be pus and blood; if expectorated, death will follow, and the patient will eventually die from expectorating pus. What does the pulse resemble? How can one distinguish it?

**Master’s Discourse:**

At the *cunkou* pulse, if it is faint yet rapid—faint indicates wind, rapid indicates heat. Faintness causes sweating; rapidity induces aversion to cold. Wind invades the *wei* (defensive qi), obstructing exhalation; heat penetrates the *ying* (nutritive qi), blocking inhalation. Wind injures the skin and hair; heat harms the blood vessels.

When wind lodges in the lungs, the patient coughs, with dry mouth, panting fullness, parched throat but no thirst, copious expectoration of turbid foam, and frequent shivering. Where heat passes, blood congeals and stagnates, forming abscesses and pus, expectorated like rice porridge. If treated at the onset, recovery is possible; once pus has formed, it is difficult to cure.

When the *cunkou* pulse is rapid and the *fuyang* pulse is tight, cold and heat contend, causing shivering and cough. If the *fuyang* pulse is floating and moderate, with stomach qi as usual, this indicates *feitong* (pulmonary abscess).

**Master’s Discourse:**
Shivering with fever, a slippery and rapid *cunkou* pulse, yet the patient’s eating and daily life remain unchanged—this is an abscess disorder. If a physician mistakenly treats it as *shanghan* (cold damage), it will not resolve.

How can one know if pus is present? How can one determine its location?

**Master’s Discourse:**
If pus is in the chest, it is *feitong*. The pulse is rapid, and coughing produces pus and blood. If pus has not yet formed, the pulse is tight and rapid; when tightness subsides and only rapidity remains, pus has formed.

**Jiegeng Decoction** treats cough with chest fullness, shivering, rapid pulse, dry throat without thirst, frequent expectoration of foul, turbid sputum, and eventual expectoration of pus resembling rice porridge—a sign of *feitong*.

Moxa three *cun* behind the nipple—left for men, right for women—with fourteen cones. If unresolved, increase the number of cones until cured.
Additionally, moxa seven cones on each thumb.
Also, moxa ten cones three *cun* below the heart.
Also, moxa one *cun* below the nipple, increasing the number of cones according to the side of the affliction.
Alternatively, measure the distance between the patient’s nipples with a fine string, then fold it in half. From the nipple, extend the string outward to the rib gap at the end, and moxa three or seven cones—left for men, right for women.

**For sudden *zhù*-*wǔ* attacking the heart and chest:**

Moxa the lung *shū*, the *sānyīnjiāo* point, and the *qīmén* point (located two ribs below the nipple). This drains the lung and tonifies the kidney, with the number of cones corresponding to the patient’s age.

**For all *zhù*, regardless of duration:**
First, have the patient lie supine and moxa three *cun* diagonally below the edge of each nipple, in the third intercostal space, according to the patient’s age, up to three hundred cones. This also treats all qi disorders with divine efficacy. Another name for this point is *zhù-shì*.

**On Lung Atrophy (Sixth Discussion and Prescriptions)**

**Discussion:**
When the *cùnkǒu* pulse is rapid and the patient suffers from coughing, yet the mouth produces turbid spittle and frothy drool—why is this?

The Master said: This is the disease of lung atrophy.

How does one contract it?

The Master said: When heat resides in the upper burner and coughing ensues, it gives rise to lung atrophy. It may also arise from profuse sweating, vomiting, or painful thirst with frequent urination, or from difficult defecation after repeated purgation with harsh medicines, severely depleting the body fluids—thus leading to lung atrophy.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse fails to emerge and yet sweating is induced, the yang pulse hastens to exhaustion while the yin pulse remains unobstructed. The triple burner hesitates, entering but not exiting. Though the yin pulse is unobstructed, the body grows cold, yet internally there is vexation, copious spittle, parched lips, and difficult urination. This is lung atrophy, where the fluids are damaged, the flesh resembling rotten melon and the discharge like pig’s brain—all due to improper sweating.

The disease manifests as a desire to cough without being able to, and when coughing occurs, only dry froth is expelled. Over time, urination becomes difficult, and the pulse is even and weak.

If lung atrophy causes the patient to spit drool without coughing, and they are not thirsty, there will inevitably be enuresis and frequent urination. The reason is that the upper burner is deficient and cannot restrain the lower—this is cold in the lung, and dizziness must follow.

The Master said: In lung atrophy with coughing and spittle, if the throat is parched and the patient desires to drink, they will recover spontaneously. If the mouth is left agape, it indicates shortness of breath.

**Licorice and Dried Ginger Decoction**
Warms the viscera, treats lung atrophy with copious drool and spittle, frequent urination, cold in the lung, and dizziness. If there is no thirst or cough, or if thirst is present (which pertains to the method for painful thirst), the upper is deficient and the lower cannot be restrained. After taking this decoction, cover the patient lightly to keep warm.

**On Lung Abscess (Seventh Discussion and Prescriptions)**

**Discussion:**
When a patient coughs up pus and blood with a rapid pulse, a replete pulse indicates lung abscess, while a vacuous pulse indicates lung atrophy.

If the mouth produces its own fluids, the tongue has a slippery coating, and there is floating cold—this is not lung atrophy.

If the mouth is parched, coughing causes dull pain in the chest, and the pulse is slippery and rapid—this is lung abscess.

**Question:**
When a patient suffers from coughing with counterflow, and the Master examines the pulse, how can one know it is lung abscess? There should be pus and blood; if it is expectorated, death follows, and indeed, the patient later spits pus and dies.

What does the pulse resemble? How can one distinguish it?

**The Master’s Response:**
At the *cun* pulse position, if the pulse is faint yet rapid—faint indicates wind, rapid indicates heat. Faintness causes sweating, rapidity causes aversion to cold. Wind invades the *wei* (defensive qi), obstructing exhalation; heat penetrates the *ying* (nutritive qi), blocking inhalation. Wind injures the skin and hair; heat harms the blood vessels.

When wind lodges in the lungs, the patient coughs, with dry mouth, panting fullness, parched throat but no thirst, copious expectoration of turbid spittle, and frequent shivering. Where heat passes, blood congeals and stagnates, forming abscesses and pus, expectorated like rice porridge. At its onset, it may be cured; once pus has formed, it is difficult to treat.

If the *cun* pulse is rapid and the *fuyang* pulse is tight, cold and heat contend, causing shivering and coughing. If the *fuyang* pulse is floating and moderate, with stomach qi as usual, this indicates lung abscess.

**The Master said:**
When shivering and fever arise, with a slippery and rapid pulse at the *cun* position, yet the patient’s eating and daily life remain unchanged—this is an abscess disorder. If a physician mistakenly treats it as cold damage, it will not resolve.

**How can one know there is pus? How can one determine its location?**
**The Master said:**
If pus is in the chest, it is lung abscess, with a rapid pulse and coughing up of pus and blood. If pus has not yet formed, the pulse will be tight and rapid; when tightness departs and only rapidity remains, pus has already formed.

**Platycodon Decoction** treats cough with chest fullness, shivering, rapid pulse, dry throat without thirst, frequent expectoration of turbid, foul-smelling spittle, and eventual expectoration of pus like rice porridge—this is lung abscess.
*Platycodon* (3 liang; *Collected Verifications* uses 2 liang; *Ancient and Modern Verified Records* uses 1 liang)
*Licorice* (2 liang)
Pound the two ingredients, boil in 3 *sheng* of water until reduced to 1 *sheng*, strain, and divide into two doses. It will induce expectoration of pus and blood.
*One formula adds 1.5 liang of coltsfoot flower.*

**Draining the Lung Decoction** treats lung abscess with inability to breathe outward.
*Tingli* (3 liang, ground to powder)
*Jujube* (20 pieces)

**For lung abscess with chest and rib distension, whole-body and facial swelling, nasal congestion, clear nasal discharge, inability to smell fragrance or stench, cough with counterflow qi, wheezing, and constriction**, first administer **Minor Blue Dragon Decoction**, then proceed with the above formulas. The **Minor Blue Dragon Decoction** is found in Scroll Eighteen.

**Huanghun Decoction** treats cough with mild fever, vexation and fullness, and scaling of the chest skin—this is lung abscess.

Also, moxa ten cones three *cun* below the heart.
Also, moxa one *cun* below the nipple, increasing cones on the affected side.
Also, measure the distance between the patient’s nipples with a fine string, cut it, fold in half, then measure outward from the nipple to the rib gap at the string’s end. Moxa three or seven cones—left for men, right for women.

It weighs two *jin* and twelve *liang*, measures one *zhang* and two *chi* in length, six *cun* in breadth, and coils twelve turns to the right of the navel, storing one *dou* and two *sheng* of water and grain. It governs the twelve double-hours, stabilizes the blood vessels, and harmonizes the essence-spirit.

*The Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold*, *The Bright Hall*, and *The Outer Terrace* concur.
*The Classic of Difficult Issues* states: Its length is two *zhang* and one *chi*, its circumference four *cun*, its diameter slightly over one *cun*, with sixteen turns, holding one *dou* of grain and seven and a half *sheng* of water. The nose extends in length to correspond to the large intestine.

If the *yang* pulse at the inch-opening before the bar of the right hand is absent, the large intestine’s pulse is absent. The patient suffers from shortness of breath and water-*qi* below the heart, and coughs upon the advent of the *Liqiu* solar term. Treat by needling the *yin* of the hand’s *Taiyin* at the *Yuji* point.

If the *yang* pulse at the inch-opening before the bar of the right hand is replete, the large intestine is replete. The patient suffers from acute pain in the intestines, as if pierced by a needle or knife, without respite. Treat by needling the *yang* of the hand’s *Yangming* at the wrist’s center, and drain it.

In large intestine disease, the intestines ache acutely with gurgling sounds, and if further afflicted by cold in winter, diarrhea ensues. Pain localizes around the navel, and the patient cannot stand for long—its signs align with those of the Stomach. Select *Juxu Shanglian*.

When the intestines rumble like thunder, *qi* surges upward to the chest and diaphragm, and the patient cannot stand for long, the evil lies in the large intestine. Needle *Gaohuang*, *Juxu Shanglian*, and *Zusanli*.

In large intestine distension, the intestines rumble and ache, and cold induces diarrhea with undigested food.

Cold in the large intestine causes watery stool; heat causes foul, sticky stool.

Retained food in the large intestine causes chills and fever at fixed times, resembling malaria.

When the Lung first contracts disease and transmits it to the large intestine, unceasing Lung cough causes incontinence of stool and urine.

When *jue-qi* lodges in the large intestine, one dreams of fields.

The Lung corresponds to the skin: thick skin indicates a thick large intestine; thin skin, a thin large intestine. Loose skin with a large abdomen indicates a slack and long large intestine; tight skin, a tense and short large intestine. Smooth skin indicates a straight large intestine; inseparable skin and flesh, a knotted large intestine.

Bian Que states: The hand’s *Taiyin* and *Yangming* form exterior-interior pairs. If the large intestine falls ill and becomes replete, it suffers from heat, which causes distension, blockage, and mouth sores. When food descends into the intestines, the intestines become replete while the Stomach is depleted; when food descends into the Stomach, the Stomach becomes replete while the intestines are depleted. Thus, repletion does not necessarily mean fullness—it alternates between repletion and depletion, coming and going.

Depletion injures from cold, and cold causes intestinal rumbling, green-white diarrhea, and *qi*-water disorders rooted in the large intestine. For formulas, see the "Water Treatments" section.

If the large intestine is severed, it is incurable. How to know? Uncontrolled diarrhea, and death upon cessation of diarrhea.

The hand’s *Yangming* vessel arises from the outer side of the tip of the index finger, ascends along its upper border, emerges between the two bones of *Hegu*, enters between the two sinews, ascends along the upper border of the forearm, enters the outer border of the elbow, ascends along the outer anterior border of the upper arm, reaches the shoulder, emerges at the anterior border of the *Yugu* bone, ascends to the meeting point of the *Zhugu*, descends into the supraclavicular fossa, connects with the Lung, descends through the diaphragm, and pertains to the large intestine.

Its branch separates from the supraclavicular fossa, ascends straight to the neck, pierces the cheek, enters the lower teeth, curves around the mouth, intersects at *Renzhong*, crossing left to right and right to left, and ascends beside the nostrils.

When it moves, it causes toothache and cheek swelling. It governs the diseases born of the fluids: yellow eyes, dry mouth, nasal discharge or bleeding, throat impediment, pain in the anterior shoulder and upper arm, and pain or dysfunction of the index finger. When *qi* is exuberant and in excess, the regions it traverses become hot and swollen; when depleted, it causes chills without recovery.

In exuberance, the *Renying* pulse is three times larger than the *cunkou*; in depletion, the *Renying* pulse is smaller than the *cunkou*.

#### **Large Intestine Depletion and Repletion, Second Discourse: Pulses, Formulas, and Moxibustion**
**Large Intestine Repletion-Heat**
If the *yang* pulse at the inch-opening before the *qi*-opening of the right hand is replete, it pertains to the *Yangming* channel. The patient suffers from abdominal fullness, frequent panting and coughing, red face, feverish body, and a throat resembling a lump—this is called large intestine repletion-heat.

**Fresh Ginger Decoction to Drain the Intestines**
Treats large intestine repletion-heat with abdominal distension, blockage, and mouth sores:
- Fresh ginger
- Tangerine peel
- Green bamboo shavings
- Scutellaria
- Gardenia seed
- White atractylodes (each three *liang*)
- Cinnamon bark (one *liang*)
- Poria
- Mirabilite (each two *liang*)
- Fresh rehmannia (ten *liang*)
- Jujubes (fourteen pieces)

Boil the eleven ingredients in seven *sheng* of water to reduce to three *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and divide into two doses.

**Formula for Intestinal Distension and Indigestion**
Moxa the large intestine *shu* point forty-nine cones.

**Large Intestine Heat**
For intestinal rumbling, abdominal fullness, pain beside the navel, indigestion, panting, and inability to stand for long, select *Juxu Shanglian*.

**Large Intestine Deficiency-Cold**
When the *yang* pulse at the *qi-kou* (radial artery proximal to the wrist) on the right hand is deficient, it pertains to the hand *yangming* channel. The patient suffers from panting in the chest, intestinal rumbling, vacuous thirst, dry lips, tense eyes, susceptibility to fright, and white diarrhea—this is termed *large intestine deficiency-cold*.

**Coptis Supplementing Decoction**
Treats large intestine deficiency-cold with green-white dysenteric discharge and intestinal rumbling in pursuit:
- Coptis (four *liang*)
- Poria (three *liang*)
- *Xiongqiong* (three *liang*)
- Sour pomegranate rind (five pieces)
- *Fu long gan* (one piece, chicken-egg sized)
- Burnet root (five *liang*)

Boil the six ingredients in seven *sheng* of water to reduce to two and a half *sheng*, strain, add powdered *fu long gan*, and divide into three doses.

**Formula for Intestinal Rumbling in Pursuit with Dysentery**
Moxa *Chengman* fifty cones. The point lies five *cun* lateral to *Jugu*. *Juque* is one *cun* below the heart; for moxibustion, apply two and a half *cun* bilaterally to *Juque*.

**Formula for Chronic Intestinal Rumbling with Upward Surge to the Heart**
Moxa the navel.

For inability to ingest food and drink, abdominal rumbling, irregular bowel movements, and reddish-yellow urine, *Yanggang* governs.

For abdominal distension, intestinal rumbling, *qi* surging upward to the chest, inability to stand long, splashing pain in the abdomen, wintertime re-exposure to cold causing diarrhea, periumbilical pain, cutting pain from wandering *qi* between intestines and stomach, indigestion, loss of appetite, generalized swelling, and periumbilical tension, *Tianshu* governs.

For painful intestinal rumbling, *Wenliu* governs.

**Discourse on the Anus (Third)**
The anus governs the great thoroughfare, corresponding to the lung and large intestine. It is called the "Communications Officer." Weighing twelve *liang*, it measures one *chi* and two *cun* in length and two *cun* and three *fen* in breadth, aligning with the twelve hours. If the *zang* is damaged by heat, the anus becomes obstructed, blocking defecation, or swells, retracts, and ulcerates. If the *fu* is damaged by cold, the anus gapes, causing watery diarrhea, and prolapses, retracting only after a long while. Treat heat by draining, cold by supplementing, and regulate deficiency and repletion according to the classics. Formulas are found in other scrolls.

---

**Discourse on Skin Deficiency and Repletion (Fourth)**
**Formulas**
The five *zang* and six *fu* internally correspond to the marrow and externally connect with the skin, hair, flesh, and interstices. If illness arises externally, the skin, hair, flesh, and interstices become blocked and tense; if it arises internally, the marrow suffers pain. Thus, the *yin-yang* exterior-interior relationship—outer skin and inner marrow—demands careful examination of the disease source.

Skin deficiency pertains to cold; skin repletion pertains to heat. All manifestations of skin deficiency and repletion are governed by the lung and large intestine. When illness arises in the skin and hair, heat corresponds to the *zang*, and cold to the *fu*.

**Shu Di Steaming Decoction**
Treats skin deficiency, governs large intestine disease, and cold *qi* blockage:
- Chopped *shu di* root and leaves (three *sheng*)
- Chopped sweet flag leaves (two *sheng*)
- Pounded peach leaves, bark, and branches (three *sheng*)
- Fine chaff (one *dou*)
- Glutinous millet (five *sheng*)

Boil the five ingredients in one *shi* and five *dou* of water until the millet is cooked, then store in a large basin. Construct a small bamboo bed to cover the basin, have the patient sit on it, and surround with mats to block wind. Cover the body with clothing and blankets. If breathing becomes labored, open a vent to release *qi*, allowing sweat to permeate the body for about two meal-times. Repeat for three days, reheating the decoction as needed. If the basin cools, place charcoal beneath it. This not only treats cold but also all skin-related taxation and cold.

**Gardenia Paste**
Treats skin repletion and lung disease with heat *qi*:
- Gardenia seed
- Unripe bitter orange
- Indigo
- Apricot kernel
- Bupleurum
- Mirabilite (each two *liang*)
- Fresh rehmannia
- Chopped bamboo leaf (each one *sheng*)
- Fresh *xuan shen* (five *liang*)
- Gypsum (eight *liang*)

Boil the ten ingredients in nine *sheng* of water to reduce to three *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and divide into three doses.

**Discourse on Cough (Fifth)**
**Symptoms, Formulas, and Moxibustion**
The classics state that the five *zang* and six *fu* all induce cough. The lung resides externally near the upper body, connecting with the skin and hair, which readily receive pathogenic *qi*. Thus, the lung alone is prone to cough.

When pathogenic *qi* invades the lung, it causes alternating chills and fever, panting, sweating, coughing with shoulder and back movement, wheezing, and in severe cases, blood-streaked sputum. If lung cough persists, it transmits to the large intestine, manifesting as fecal incontinence during coughing.

Kidney cough manifests as dragging pain in the waist and back, and in severe cases, coughing with drooling. If kidney cough persists, it transmits to the bladder, manifesting as urinary incontinence during coughing.

Liver cough manifests as pain in the left flank, and in severe cases, inability to turn. If liver cough persists, it transmits to the gallbladder, manifesting as coughing with bitter fluid.

Heart cough manifests as dragging heart pain, a sensation of obstruction in the throat, and in severe cases, throat blockage and swelling. If heart cough persists, it transmits to the small intestine, manifesting as flatulence during coughing.

Spleen cough manifests as pain in the right flank, dragging dull pain to the shoulder and back, and in severe cases, inability to move, with cough worsening upon movement. If spleen cough persists, it transmits to the stomach, manifesting as coughing with vomiting, and in severe cases, expulsion of roundworms.

If cough persists, the triple burner receives it. Triple burner cough manifests as coughing with abdominal fullness and inability to eat. This all accumulates in the stomach and connects with the lung, causing profuse nasal discharge, facial swelling, and *qi* counterflow.

When seasonal wind, cold, or chill invades due to improper clothing, it damages the skin and hair, enters the *fu* and *zang*, and causes cough with *qi* ascent. Alternatively, sudden exposure to unseasonable cold damages the skin and connects with the lung, causing cough, *qi* ascent, or chest and flank pain with blood-streaked sputum. This occurs when heat encounters unseasonable cold, violently constricting without gradual dispersion, deeply lodging and predisposing to lung abscess.

If cough persists after taking warming medicinals, it may worsen with high fever, expectoration of pus and blood, sweating, and aversion to cold. When unseasonable cold prevails, promptly consult the seasonal remedies.

Question: There are said to be ten types of cough—what are they?
Master: They are wind-cough, cold-cough, *zhi*-cough, liver-cough, heart-cough, spleen-cough, lung-cough, kidney-cough, gallbladder-cough, and *jueyin*-cough.

Question: How do the signs of the ten coughs differ?
Master: When one wishes to speak but cannot finish due to coughing, it is wind-cough. Cough triggered by drinking cold or eating chilled foods is cold-cough. Firm fullness below the heart with splinting pain upon coughing and a slow pulse is *zhi*-cough. Cough that radiates pain to the flanks is liver-cough. Cough with blood-streaked sputum radiating to the *Hand Shaoyin* channel is heart-cough. Cough with continuous drooling and radiation to the lower abdomen is spleen-cough. Cough radiating to the neck and nape with frothy sputum is lung-cough. Cough with deafness and radiation to the waist and umbilicus is kidney-cough. Cough radiating to the head with headache and bitter taste in the mouth is gallbladder-cough. Cough radiating to the root of the tongue is *jueyin*-cough.

For wind-cough, do not purge. For cold-cough, *zhi*-cough, and liver-cough, needle *Foot Tai Chong*. For heart-cough, needle *Hand Shen Men*. For spleen-cough, needle *Foot Tai Bai*. For lung-cough, needle *Hand Tai Yuan*. For kidney-cough, needle *Foot Tai Xi*. For gallbladder-cough, needle *Foot Yang Ling Quan*. For *jueyin*-cough, needle *Hand Da Ling*.

Chronic cough may lead to [lacuna]. Cough with intermittent fever and a pulse resembling nine *shu* (or suddenly wiry) is not due to deficiency but to cold repletion in the chest—induce vomiting. For those with cough and a wiry pulse who are to be given emetic medicinals, assess the patient’s strength and ensure absence of heat before proceeding.

In cough patients with a wiry pulse, water is present—administer *Shi Zao Tang* (Ten Jujubes Decoction) to purge it (formula below). Inability to lie flat indicates the *yin* is unaffected by evil. In cough due to retained fluids, the patient cannot lie down, and cough radiates pain upward to the neck, resembling a child’s convulsive movements.

For those with alcohol-induced cough, blood expectoration is inevitable, caused by prolonged excessive drinking. If the pulse is deep, sweating must not be induced. In chronic cough lasting years, a weak pulse indicates treatability, while a replete, large, and rapid pulse portends death. A deficient pulse with frequent dizziness suggests underlying retained fluids in the chest—treatment follows the principles for fluid retention. Cough with sweating and *qi* ascent pertains to fluid retention. Cough with normal urination or enuresis contraindicates sweating, as sweating may induce cold counterflow and reversal.

In cases of hematemesis with panting, *qi* ascent, a rapid pulse, heat, and inability to lie flat—death ensues. In cold-induced cough with *qi* ascent and a rapid pulse, death follows due to physical depletion. A large and scattered pulse indicates *qi* repletion and blood deficiency, termed "exterior without interior."

For *qi* ascent with facial puffiness, raised shoulders, and labored breathing, a floating and large pulse is untreatable—worsening with diarrhea is even more severe. *Qi* ascent with restlessness and panting pertains to lung distention, foreshadowing wind-water—sweating resolves it.

*Xiao Qing Long Tang* (Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction) treats cough with counterflow *qi*, propped breathing, and inability to lie flat:
Ephedra, peony, asarum, cinnamon twig, dried ginger, and licorice, each three *liang*; schisandra and pinellia, each half *sheng*.
Crush these eight ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, first boiling ephedra to reduce by two *sheng*, skim off the froth, then add the remaining medicinals, and boil to three *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses; the weak may take half a *sheng*.
If thirsty, remove pinellia and add three *liang* of trichosanthes root.
If mild diarrhea occurs, remove ephedra and add *rao hua* the size of a chicken egg.
If food or drink causes hiccups, remove ephedra and add one piece of aconite.
If urination is inhibited with lower abdominal fullness, remove ephedra and add four *liang* of poria.
If panting occurs, remove ephedra and add half a *sheng* of apricot kernel.

After taking *Qing Long Tang*, if copious spittle, dry mouth, a sunken *cun* pulse, faint *chi* pulse, cold limbs, *qi* surging from the lower abdomen to the chest and throat, numbness in the limbs, flushed face resembling intoxication, *qi* descending to the inner thighs, urinary difficulty, and intermittent dizziness occur, administer *Fu Ling Gui Xin Gan Cao Wu Wei Zi Tang* (Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Licorice, and Schisandra Decoction) to treat the surging *qi*:
Four *liang* of poria, two *liang* each of cinnamon twig and licorice, and half a *sheng* of schisandra.
Crush these four ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to three *sheng*, strain, and divide into three warm doses.

If the surging *qi* subsides but cough and chest fullness worsen, use poria, licorice, and schisandra, remove cinnamon twig, and add dried ginger and asarum to treat cough and fullness:
Four *liang* of poria, three *liang* each of licorice, dried ginger, and asarum, and half a *sheng* of schisandra.
Crush these five ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm, three times daily. Cough and fullness will cease, but thirst may recur with resurgence of surging *qi*—as asarum and dried ginger are warming medicinals, thirst should follow their use. If thirst ceases instead, it indicates retained fluids, which typically cause dizziness. Dizziness leads to vomiting, so add pinellia to expel water:
Half a *sheng* each of pinellia and schisandra, four *liang* of poria, and two *liang* each of asarum, dried ginger, and licorice.
Crush these six ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm, three times daily. Once water is expelled and vomiting ceases, if the patient develops edema, ephedra should be added. However, as the patient has developed numbness, ephedra is omitted, and apricot kernel is added instead. [Formula incomplete.]

Apricot kernel, schisandra, and pinellia, each half a *sheng*; poria, four *liang*; asarum, dried ginger, and licorice, each three *liang*.
Crush these seven ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water to three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm, three times daily.
If ephedra is added despite counterflow, the patient will surely suffer reversal. The reason is that the patient’s blood is deficient, and ephedra effuses their yang.
If the face becomes hot as if drunk, this indicates stomach heat surging upward to steam the face. Add rhubarb to drain it:
Rhubarb, dried ginger, asarum, and licorice, each three *liang*; poria, four *liang*; schisandra, pinellia, and apricot kernel, each half a *sheng*.
Crush these eight ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water to three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm, three times daily.

For cough with counterflow *qi*, lung distension, a floating pulse, water *qi* below the heart, and pain in the rib-sides radiating to the supraclavicular fossa—if there is repletion, the patient will surely become restless, often leaning forward. Minor Blue Dragon Decoction with Gypsum governs this:
Gypsum, dried ginger, cinnamon bark, and asarum, each two *liang*; peony and licorice, each three *liang*; ephedra, four *liang*; pinellia, half a *sheng*; schisandra, one *sheng*.
Crush these nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water—first boil ephedra to reduce by two *sheng*, then add the remaining ingredients and decoct to two and a half *sheng*. The robust may take one *sheng*; the weak should reduce the dose; children, four *ge*.
Master Zhongjing used this to treat lung distension, cough with counterflow *qi*, vexation, agitation, panting, and a floating pulse due to water below the heart. The *Waatai* concurs.

Zeqi Decoction governs counterflow *qi* with a sunken pulse:
Three *jin* of zeqi, finely chopped, decocted in five *dou* of east-flowing water to one *dou* and five *sheng*; strain, clarify, and retain the liquid. Pinellia, half a *sheng*; fresh ginger, aster (or *zishen*), and baiqian, each five *liang*; scutellaria, licorice, cinnamon bark, and ginseng, each three *liang*.
Add these nine ingredients to the zeqi liquid and decoct to five *sheng*. Take five *ge* per dose, three times daily and once at night.

Ophiopogon Decoction descends *qi*, checks counterflow, and treats severe counterflow with counterflow *qi* and throat discomfort:

Belamcanda and Ephedra Decoction treats cough with counterflow *qi* and a croaking sound in the throat like a waterfowl:
Belamcanda, asarum, coltsfoot, and aster, each three *liang*; ephedra and fresh ginger, each four *liang*; seven jujubes; pinellia and schisandra, each half a *sheng*.
Crush these nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* and two *sheng* of east-flowing water—first boil ephedra and skim off the foam, then add the remaining ingredients and decoct to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, taken three times daily.

Magnolia and Ephedra Decoction treats cough with severe counterflow, counterflow *qi*, chest fullness, throat discomfort with a croaking sound like a waterfowl, and a floating pulse:

Crush these nine ingredients, decoct in one *dou* and two *sheng* of water—first boil the wheat until done, discard the wheat, then add the remaining ingredients and decoct to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses, taken three times daily.

Ephedra and Gypsum Decoction treats counterflow *qi* with chest fullness:
Four *liang* of ephedra; one egg-sized piece of gypsum; five *liang* of magnolia bark; one *sheng* of wheat; half a *sheng* of apricot kernel.
Crush these five ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water—first boil the wheat until done, discard it, then add the remaining ingredients and decoct to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses.
The *Shenshi* version treats chronic counterflow *qi* with a croaking sound in the throat like a waterfowl, calling it Minor "Toss-the-Cup" Decoction. For cough, add half a *sheng* each of schisandra and pinellia, and three *lei* of dried ginger.

Gleditsia Pill treats cough with counterflow *qi*, frequent expectoration of turbid sputum, and inability to lie flat:
Eight *liang* of gleditsia pods, ground to powder and formed into honey pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills with jujube paste and decoction, three times daily and once at night. The *Bixiao Fang* version uses gleditsia stir-fried with butter.

Ten Jujubes Decoction: For those with retained fluids who suffer from cough, vexation, and chest pain—though not dying suddenly, even after a hundred days or a year, this formula may be given:
Ten jujubes; equal parts of *daji*, kansui, and genkwa.
Grind *daji*, kansui, and genkwa into powder. Boil the jujubes in one *sheng* and five *ge* of water to eight *ge*, strain, and add the medicinal powder. The robust may take one *qianbi*; the weak, half a *qian*. Take in one dose in the early morning. If there is no purgation, add half a *qian* more the next morning. After purgation, naturally restore and nourish.
Cough with pain radiating to the rib-sides is also governed by Ten Jujubes Decoction (see above).

Warm the Spleen Decoction treats cough after eating to satiety:
Four *liang* of licorice; twenty jujubes.

Gently warm the sugar until melted, add the gleditsia powder, and blend thoroughly. Form into pills the size of small beans. Take two pills before meals.

**Another Remedy:**

Steep two plump gleditsia pods in one and a half *sheng* of wine overnight, then simmer to reduce to half a *sheng*. Divide into three doses; observe the seven-day dietary restrictions as for medicinals. If vomiting is excessive, consume three or four mouthfuls of vinegar-soaked rice to arrest it.

**Another Remedy:**

Swallow roasted croton seeds (skin removed, flesh unbroken) with water: two seeds on the first day, three on the second.

**Another Remedy:**

Take seven mustard seeds with oil and wine.

**Formula for all lung diseases, coughing with pus and blood, and incessant spitting of blood:**
Refine thirty *jin* of fine butter three times, then let it settle until clarified butter forms. Take one *ge* three times daily until recovery.

All medicinal remedies derive from this divine formula.

**Alternative Formula:**
Refine butter three times until it resembles the yolk of a chicken egg. Adjust to a moderate temperature and pour into the nostrils—twice daily and once at night.

**Stalactite Seven-Star Powder** for cold-induced coughing, counterflow qi, chest fullness, and spitting of pus and blood (also called *Inhalation Powder*):
Equal parts stalactite, alum, coltsfoot flower, and cassia bark.
Grind the four ingredients into a fine powder and sift. Form into seven clusters the size of large soybeans, arranged in the shape of the Seven Stars. Use a small tube to inhale the powder, then swallow with wine. Take before meals, three times daily; if ineffective, gradually increase the dosage. Repeated trials confirm its great efficacy. Some also recommend inhaling it while standing over a well.

**Alternative Formula:**
Equal parts stalactite, asarum, coltsfoot flower, aconite, aster, and gypsum.
Grind the six ingredients into a fine powder and sift. Form into seven clusters the size of large soybeans and inhale as described above, twice daily. Consume only congee for seven days, discontinuing once the cough is cured. If the soybean-sized clusters prove ineffective, slightly increase the amount—do not overdo it.

**Seven-Star Powder** for thirty-year chronic cough:
One *liang* each of coltsfoot flower, aster, white mulberry root bark, hematite, asarum, and oven earth.
Grind the six ingredients into a fine powder and sift. Form into seven-star clusters, each the size of a *bian* bean. Place the mouth of a bamboo tube over the clusters and inhale one by one, allowing the medicine to enter the abdomen. Take three clusters before meals daily for four days. Then prepare another seven-star cluster and roast a piece of meat (such as lamb, beef, or venison—pork is unsuitable) until cooked. Roll the clusters over the meat until fully coated, then lie supine and chew the meat slowly, swallowing the juices so the medicinal power permeates the throat. Once the medicine’s effect is exhausted, swallow the residue. Discontinue upon recovery; if not cured, repeat the process as before.

**Method for Treating Cough by Fumigation:**
Spread a thin layer of prepared mugwort on paper, four *cun* in width. Then evenly sprinkle sulfur powder over the mugwort, ensuring uniform distribution. Take one *di* reed of the same length as the paper and roll it into ten cylinders. First, ignite the lower end of the reed wrapping, allowing smoke to emerge from the opening. Inhale the smoke through the mouth and swallow it until vomiting ceases. The following morning, repeat the fumigation as before. Perform this once or twice daily until natural recovery. Congee may be consumed; all other foods are to be avoided. (Note: If the fumigant resembles sulfur, it may burst into flame upon ignition.)

**Alternative Formula:**
Grind one *liang* of fumigant sulfur into a fine powder. Mix it thoroughly with wax paper until fully incorporated, then roll it as described above. Perform the fumigation in the same manner, once or twice daily, until vomiting occurs. After seven days of rest, consume mutton broth for nourishment.

**Another Formula:**
Take a piece of worn blue cloth, four *cun* in width. Layer mugwort on the cloth, followed by green vitriol powder, a small amount of fumigant sulfur, a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of fermented soybean powder. Roll tightly, ignite, and place inside a dry jar. Cover the jar’s mouth with paper, leaving a small hole. Inhale the smoke through the mouth and swallow it slowly until vomiting occurs. If chest tightness arises, pause briefly; cease when the smoke is exhausted. Perform this once or twice daily, using three rolls for a complete course. Avoid greasy foods for twenty-one days.

**Discourse:**
For conditions of rising *qi*, many recover through emetic remedies, while others find relief through acupuncture and moxibustion. These methods warrant deep reflection.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
For cough, apply one hundred cones of moxa to the black-white junction below each nipple—this brings immediate relief.

Alternatively, encircle the body with a rush mat aligned with the nipples, ensuring front and back are level. Apply ten cones of moxa at the midpoint where the mat meets the spine.

Another method: Measure the mouth’s width with a string, fold it, and place it along the spine. Apply eighty cones of moxa at each end of the string, repeating three times over three days. The two ends correspond to the mouth’s width.

For moxibustion, count downward from *Dazhui* (GV-14) to the fifth vertebra, then apply cones to the sixth vertebra’s upper border—this is *Shendao* (GV-11), with the number of cones matching the patient’s age. This also treats rising *qi*.

For cough with rising *qi*, shortness of breath, and fullness, apply fourteen cones to the painful point at the transverse crease of the flexed elbow’s outer bone—this is highly effective.

For cough with rising *qi*, shortness of breath, fullness, and inability to eat, apply fifty cones to *Feishu* (BL-13).

For cough with rising *qi*, counterflow, shortness of breath, and various wind-labor ailments, apply two hundred cones to *Jianjing* (GB-21).

For cough with rising *qi*, shortness of breath, chest and back pain, apply one hundred cones to *Fengmen* (BL-12).

For cough with rising *qi*, chest fullness, shortness of breath, and back pain, apply fifty cones each to *Juque* (CV-14) and *Qimen* (LR-14).

For cough with rising *qi*, shortness of breath, chest fullness, copious spittle, and expectoration of cold, foul phlegm, apply fifty cones to *Feishu* (BL-13).

For rising *qi*, chest fullness, shortness of breath, and cough, apply fifty cones to *Yunmen* (LU-2).

For cough with rising *qi*, chest impediment, and back pain, apply one hundred cones to *Xiongtang* (ST-18)—do not needle.

For cough with rising *qi*, apply fifty cones to *Shanzhong* (CV-17).

For rising *qi* with blockage, cough, cold throat, hoarse voice, and wheezing, apply fifty cones to *Tianqu* (CV-22), also called *Tiantu*.

For counterflow *qi*, vacuity taxation, cold damage, sorrow-induced illness, sinew-bone contracture and pain, heart cough, counterflow, diarrhea, *zhù* (lingering illness), abdominal fullness, throat impediment, stiff neck, intestinal hemorrhoids, hemorrhoid bleeding, yin urgency, nosebleed, bone pain, inhibited urination and defecation, nasal dryness, vexation and fullness, manic wandering, and *yi* (qi) disorders—twenty-two conditions in total—apply fifty cones to *Juegu* (GB-39), located three *cun* above the outer ankle’s depression.

**Formulas for the Large Intestine Repository**

**Discourse on the Large Intestine Repository Pulse, First**
The discourse states: The large intestine repository governs the lung, and its indicator lies at the center of the nasal bridge. The lung joins *qi* with the large intestine, which serves as the repository for transmission and drainage, known as the "steward of the granary." It weighs two *jin* and twelve *liang*, measures twelve *chi* in length and six *cun* in breadth, coils twelve turns to the right of the navel, and holds one *dou* and two *sheng* of water and grain. It governs the twelve hours, stabilizes the blood vessels, and harmonizes the spirit. The *Qianjin*, *Mingtang*, and *Waitai* texts concur. The *Nanjing* states: Its length is two *zhang* and one *chi*, its breadth four *cun*, its diameter slightly over one *cun*, with sixteen turns, holding one *dou* of grain and seven and a half *sheng* of water. The nose extends in length to correspond with the large intestine.

If the *yang* pulse at the *cun* position before the right *guan* is absent, the large intestine pulse is absent. The patient suffers from shortness of breath and water *qi* below the heart, and coughing begins at the start of autumn. Treat by needling the *yin* of the hand *Taiyin* at the *yuji* point.

If the *yang* pulse at the *cun* position before the right *guan* is replete, the large intestine is replete. The patient suffers from acute pain in the intestines, as if pierced by a needle or knife, without respite. Treat by needling the *yang* of the hand *Yangming* at the wrist, and drain it.

In large intestine disease, the intestines ache acutely with gurgling sounds. If further afflicted by cold in winter, diarrhea ensues, with pain around the navel and inability to stand for long. Its symptoms align with those of the stomach. Select the *juxu shanglian* point.

If there is rumbling in the intestines and *qi* surges upward into the chest and diaphragm, with inability to stand for long, the evil lies in the large intestine. Needle the *yuan* of the back, *juxu shanglian*, and *sanli*.

In large intestine distension, the intestines rumble with pain, and cold induces diarrhea with undigested food. Cold in the large intestine causes loose stools, while heat causes foul, sticky stools. If the large intestine retains undigested food, chills and fever arise at fixed times, resembling malaria. When the lung is first afflicted and the disease shifts to the large intestine, unceasing lung cough leads to incontinence of stool. If *jue qi* lodges in the large intestine, one dreams of fields.

The lung corresponds to the skin. If the skin is thick, the large intestine is thick; if the skin is thin, the large intestine is thin. If the skin is slack and the abdomen large, the large intestine is slack and long; if the skin is tight, the large intestine is tight and short; if the skin is smooth, the large intestine is straight; if skin and flesh do not separate, the large intestine is knotted.

Bian Que states: The hand *Taiyin* and *Yangming* form an exterior-interior pair. If the large intestine is diseased and replete, it suffers from heat, which causes distension, blockage, and mouth sores. When food descends into the intestines, the intestines become replete while the stomach is empty; when food descends into the stomach, the stomach becomes replete while the intestines are empty. Thus, repletion does not cause fullness, but alternates between repletion and emptiness, coming and going unpredictably. Emptiness leads to cold damage, which causes rumbling in the intestines, green-white diarrhea, and *qi*-water disease, with its root in the large intestine. For formulas, see the "Water Treatment" section.

If the large intestine is severed, it is incurable. How is this known? Uncontrollable diarrhea indicates death.

The hand *Yangming* channel begins at the outer tip of the index finger, follows the upper edge of the finger, emerges between the two bones of *hegu*, ascends into the space between the two tendons, follows the upper edge of the arm, enters the outer edge of the elbow, follows the outer front edge of the upper arm, ascends to the shoulder, emerges at the front edge of the *yu* bone, rises to meet the *zhugu*, descends into the *quepen*, connects with the lung, passes through the diaphragm, and pertains to the large intestine. Its branch ascends straight from the *quepen* to the neck, pierces the cheek, enters the lower teeth, circles back to the mouth, crosses at the *renzhong*, with the left channel going to the right and the right to the left, and ascends beside the nostrils.

When this channel is stirred, it causes toothache and cheek swelling. The diseases it governs through the generation of fluids include yellow eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, throat impediment, pain in the front of the shoulder and upper arm, and pain or inability to use the index finger. If *qi* is exuberant and in excess, the areas the channel traverses become hot and swollen; if deficient, there are chills without recovery. In exuberance, the *renying* pulse is three times larger than the *cunkou*; in deficiency, the *renying* is smaller than the *cunkou*.

**Second: Large Intestine Deficiency and Repletion, Pulses, Formulas, and Moxibustion**

**Large Intestine Repletion-Heat**
If the *yang* pulse at the *cunkou* before the right *guan* is replete, it pertains to the *Yangming* channel. The patient suffers from abdominal fullness, frequent panting and coughing, red face, fever, and a kernel-like sensation in the throat—this is called large intestine repletion-heat.

*Shengjiang Xiechang Tang* (Fresh Ginger Decoction to Drain the Intestines) treats large intestine repletion-heat with abdominal distension, blockage, and mouth sores:
Fresh ginger, tangerine peel, green bamboo shavings, scutellaria, gardenia seed, white atractylodes—three *liang* each; cinnamon heart—one *liang*; poria, mirabilite—two *liang* each; fresh rehmannia—ten *liang*; jujubes—fourteen pieces.
Boil the eleven ingredients in seven *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and divide into two doses.

For abdominal distension that does not resolve:
Moxa the *dachangshu* point forty-nine times.

For heat in the large intestine with intestinal rumbling, abdominal fullness, pain beside the navel, undigested food, panting, and inability to stand for long:
The *juxu shanglian* point governs this.

**Large Intestine Deficiency-Cold**
If the *yang* pulse at the *cunkou* before the right *guan* is deficient, it pertains to the hand *Yangming* channel. The patient suffers from panting in the chest, intestinal rumbling, deficiency-thirst, dry lips, tense eyes, frequent fright, and white diarrhea—this is called large intestine deficiency-cold.

*Huanglian Bu Tang* (Coptis Supplementing Decoction) treats large intestine deficiency-cold with green-white dysentery and rumbling intestines:
Coptis—four *liang*; poria, chuanxiong—three *liang* each; pomegranate rind—five pieces; *fulonggan* (oven earth)—one piece the size of a chicken egg; sanguisorba—five *liang*.
Boil the six ingredients in seven *sheng* of water to obtain two and a half *sheng*, strain, add powdered *fulonggan*, and divide into three doses.

For rumbling intestines with dysentery:

Moxibustion at *Chengman* with fifty cones. The point is located five *cun* lateral to *Jugu*. *Juque* lies one *cun* below the heart; for moxibustion, apply two and a half *cun* bilaterally to *Juque*. For chronic intestinal rumbling with occasional surging upward to the heart: moxibustion at the navel.

For inability to ingest food and drink, abdominal rumbling, irregular bowel movements, and reddish-yellow urine, *Yanggang* governs this. For abdominal distension, intestinal rumbling, qi surging upward to the chest, inability to stand for long, splashing pain in the abdomen, wintertime re-exposure to cold leading to diarrhea, pain centered at the navel, cutting pain from wandering qi between the intestines and stomach, indigestion, loss of appetite, bodily swelling, and tension lateral to the navel, *Tianshu* governs this. For intestinal rumbling with pain, *Wenliu* governs this.

**Discourse on the Anus (Third)**
The anus governs the great passage of the Dao, corresponding to the lung and large intestine. It is called the "Communicating Clerk." It weighs twelve *liang*, measures one *chi* and two *cun* in length, and two *cun* and three *fen* in width, aligning with the twelve hours. If the viscera are injured by heat, the anus becomes obstructed, blocking the great passage, or swells, retracts, and develops sores. If the bowels are injured by cold, the anus opens, leading to unchecked diarrhea, prolapse of the anus, which retracts only after a long while. For heat, promote flow; for cold, supplement; regulate deficiency and excess to achieve harmony, following the classics. Formulas are found in other volumes.

**Discourse on Skin Deficiency and Excess (Fourth)**
**Formulas**
The five viscera and six bowels internally correspond to the bone marrow and externally connect with the skin, hair, flesh, and muscles. If illness arises externally, the skin, hair, flesh, and muscles become stiff and tense; if illness arises internally, the bone marrow aches. As yin and yang, exterior and interior—outer skin and inner marrow—must be examined in detail regarding the source of illness.

Skin deficiency pertains to cold; skin excess pertains to heat. All manifestations of skin deficiency and excess are governed by the lung and large intestine. When illness arises in the skin and hair, heat corresponds to the viscera, and cold to the bowels.

*Shuodi Steaming Decoction* treats skin deficiency, governs large intestine illness, and cold qi causing obstruction:
Shredded *shuodi* root and leaves—three *sheng*; shredded calamus leaves—two *sheng*; chopped peach leaves, bark, and branches—three *sheng*; fine chaff—one *dou*; glutinous millet—five *sheng*.
Boil the five ingredients in one *shi* and five *dou* of water until the millet is cooked. Store in a large basin, cover with a small bamboo bed over the basin, and have the patient sit on the bed. Surround with mats to block wind, and cover the body with clothing and blankets. If breathing becomes labored, occasionally open a vent to release qi. Steam until the entire body sweats, for about the time of two meals. Repeat for three days, reheating the decoction as needed. If the basin is not sufficiently hot, place charcoal beneath it. This not only treats cold but also all skin-related fatigue and cold.

*Gardenia Paste* treats skin excess and lung illness with heat qi:
Gardenia seeds—two *liang*; unripe bitter orange—two *liang*; *daqing*—two *liang*; apricot kernels—two *liang*; bupleurum—two *liang*; mirabilite—two *liang*; fresh rehmannia—five *liang*; shredded bamboo leaves—one *sheng*; fresh *xuanshen*—five *liang*; gypsum—eight *liang*.
Boil the ten ingredients in nine *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, add mirabilite, and divide into three doses.

**Discourse on Cough (Fifth)**
**Symptoms, Formulas, and Moxibustion Methods**
The classics state that the five viscera and six bowels all cause cough. The lung resides externally and superiorly, connecting with the skin and hair. As the skin and hair readily receive pathogenic qi, the lung alone is easily afflicted by cough. When pathogenic qi invades the lung, there is alternating cold and heat, rising qi, panting, sweating, coughing that agitates the shoulders and back, wheezing in the throat, and in severe cases, blood in the sputum. If lung cough persists, it transmits to the large intestine, manifesting as fecal incontinence during coughing.

Kidney cough presents with dragging pain in the waist and back, and in severe cases, coughing up drool. If kidney cough persists, it transmits to the bladder, manifesting as urinary incontinence during coughing.

Liver cough presents with pain in the left flank, and in severe cases, inability to turn. If liver cough persists, it transmits to the gallbladder, manifesting as coughing up clear, bitter fluid.

Heart cough presents with dragging heart pain, a sensation of obstruction in the throat, and in severe cases, throat blockage and swelling. If heart cough persists, it transmits to the small intestine, manifesting as loss of control over qi (flatulence) during coughing.

Spleen cough presents with pain in the right flank, dull dragging pain to the shoulder and back, and in severe cases, inability to move, with cough worsening upon movement. If spleen cough persists, it transmits to the stomach, manifesting as coughing with vomiting, and in severe cases, expulsion of roundworms.

If cough persists, the triple burner receives it. Triple burner cough presents as cough with abdominal fullness and inability to eat. This all accumulates in the stomach and connects with the lung, causing excessive nasal discharge, sputum, facial swelling, and counterflow qi.

When seasonal wind, cold, or chill invades due to improper attire, it harms the skin and hair, enters the bowels and viscera, and causes cough with rising qi. Alternatively, sudden exposure to unseasonable cold harms the skin and connects with the lung, causing cough, rising qi, or stabbing pain in the chest and flanks, and blood in the sputum. This occurs when heat encounters unseasonable cold, preventing gradual dispersion, leading to deep-seated stagnation and predisposition to lung abscess. If warm medicinals are administered for cough, the cough may worsen, with high fever, expectoration of pus and blood, sweating, and aversion to cold—this is the case. When unseasonable cold occurs, urgently consult the seasonal formulas.

Question: There are ten types of cough—what are they?
Master: Wind cough, cold cough, *zhi* cough, liver cough, heart cough, spleen cough, lung cough, kidney cough, gallbladder cough, and *jueyin* cough.

Question: How do the symptoms of the ten coughs differ?
Master: If one wishes to speak but cannot finish due to coughing, it is called wind cough.

Ingesting cold drinks or cold food and subsequently coughing is called cold cough. When the region below the heart is firm and full, and coughing causes pain in the flanks, with a pulse that is unexpectedly slow, this is called *zhi* cough. When coughing draws pain beneath the ribs, it is called liver cough. When coughing brings up blood and extends to the hand *Shaoyin* channel, it is called heart cough. When coughing produces continuous drooling that does not cease and extends to the lower abdomen, it is called spleen cough. When coughing draws pain to the neck and nape and produces frothy spittle, it is called lung cough. When coughing causes deafness and extends to the waist and navel, it is called kidney cough. When coughing draws head pain and a bitter taste in the mouth, it is called gallbladder cough. When coughing draws pain to the root of the tongue, it is called *Jueyin* cough.

For wind cough, do not administer purgatives. For cold cough, *zhi* cough, and liver cough, needle *Zutai Chong*. For heart cough, needle *Shoushen Men*. For spleen cough, needle *Zutai Bai*. For lung cough, needle *Shoutai Quan*. For kidney cough, needle *Zutai Xi*. For gallbladder cough, needle *Zuyang Lingquan*. For *Jueyin* cough, needle *Shoudaling*.

Chronic cough may lead to [lacuna], and cough accompanied by intermittent fever with a pulse resembling nine peas (or suddenly wiry) is not due to deficiency but rather to cold repletion in the chest—this should be treated by emesis. For those with chronic cough whose pulse is wiry and who are to be given emetic medicinals, one must assess the patient’s strength and ensure there is no fever before proceeding with emesis.

In cases of chronic cough, a wiry pulse indicates the presence of water, which may be purged with *Shizao Tang* (see below for the formula). If the patient cannot lie down, this is because *yin* does not receive the pathogenic influence. In cases of retained fluid cough, the patient cannot lie down, and coughing draws pain upward to the nape, resembling the convulsive movements of a child. For those with a history of alcohol consumption who develop cough, it will inevitably lead to blood ejection, caused by prolonged excessive drinking—if the pulse is deep, sweating should not be induced.

For chronic cough lasting several years, if the pulse is weak, it is treatable; if it is replete, large, and rapid, the condition is fatal. If the pulse is deficient, the patient will frequently experience dizziness, as there is originally retained fluid in the chest—this falls under the treatment principles for fluid retention. Cough with panting and sweating also belongs to the category of fluid retention. If coughing is accompanied by normal urination or incontinence, sweating must not be induced, as it will lead to reversal cold of the limbs.

In cases of blood ejection with panting, cough, and counterflow *qi*, if the pulse is rapid and there is heat with inability to lie down, the patient will die. For those with cold-induced cough and counterflow *qi*, if the pulse is rapid, death ensues due to physical depletion. A pulse that is large and scattered indicates *qi* repletion and blood deficiency, termed "having an exterior but no interior."

For counterflow *qi* with facial puffiness and shoulder breathing, if the pulse is floating and large, the condition is incurable—if accompanied by diarrhea, it is even more severe. For counterflow *qi* with restlessness and panting, this pertains to lung distention, which may develop into wind-water; sweating will resolve it.

*Xiao Qinglong Tang* (Minor Blue Dragon Decoction) treats cough with counterflow *qi*, labored breathing, and inability to lie down. The formula is as follows:
Ephedra (*mahuang*), Peony (*shaoyao*), Asarum (*xixin*), Cinnamon twig (*guixin*), Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), and Licorice (*gancao*), each three *liang*; Schisandra (*wuweizi*) and Pinellia (*banxia*), each half a *sheng*.
Grind the eight ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water, first boil the ephedra to reduce the liquid by two *sheng*, skim off the foam, then add the remaining ingredients and boil to obtain three *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses; weaker patients may take half a *sheng* per dose.
- If thirsty, remove pinellia and add three *liang* of Trichosanthes root (*gualougen*).
- If mild diarrhea occurs, remove ephedra and add *raohua* the size of a chicken egg.
- If there is difficulty swallowing food or drink, remove ephedra and add one piece of Aconite (*fuzi*).
- If urination is inhibited and the lower abdomen is full, remove ephedra and add four *liang* of Poria (*fuling*).
- If panting occurs, remove ephedra and add half a *sheng* of Apricot kernel (*xingren*).

After taking *Qinglong Tang*, if there is excessive spittle, dry mouth, a sunken *cun* pulse, faint *chi* pulse, reversal cold of the limbs, *qi* surging from the lower abdomen to the chest and throat, numbness of the limbs, and a flushed face resembling intoxication, followed by *qi* descending to the inner thighs, difficulty urinating, and intermittent dizziness, administer *Fuling Guixin Gancao Wuweizi Tang* to treat the surging *qi*. The formula is:
Poria (*fuling*) four *liang*, Cinnamon twig (*guixin*) and Licorice (*gancao*) each two *liang*, Schisandra (*wuweizi*) half a *sheng*.
Grind the four ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, and divide into three doses, taken warm.

If the surging *qi* subsides but cough and chest fullness worsen, use Poria, Licorice, and Schisandra, remove cinnamon twig, and add dried ginger and asarum to treat the cough and fullness. The formula is:
Poria (*fuling*) four *liang*, Licorice (*gancao*), Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), and Asarum (*xixin*) each three *liang*, Schisandra (*wuweizi*) half a *sheng*.
Grind the five ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm three times daily. When cough and fullness cease but thirst returns and surging *qi* recurs, this is because asarum and dried ginger are warming medicinals—taking them should induce thirst. If thirst ceases instead, it indicates retained fluid, which typically causes dizziness. Dizziness leads to vomiting, so add pinellia to expel the water. The formula is:
Pinellia (*banxia*) and Schisandra (*wuweizi*) each half a *sheng*, Poria (*fuling*) four *liang*, Asarum (*xixin*), Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), and Licorice (*gancao*) each two *liang*.
Grind the six ingredients, decoct in eight *sheng* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm three times daily. Once the water is expelled and vomiting ceases, if the patient develops facial swelling, ephedra should be added. However, if the patient experiences numbness, ephedra is omitted, and apricot kernel is added instead. The formula is:
Apricot kernel (*xingren*), Schisandra (*wuweizi*), and Pinellia (*banxia*) each half a *sheng*, Poria (*fuling*) four *liang*, Asarum (*xixin*), Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), and Licorice (*gancao*) each three *liang*.
Grind the seven ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm three times daily.

If ephedra is added despite counterflow symptoms, the patient will inevitably experience reversal cold. This occurs because the patient is blood-deficient, and ephedra effuses *yang qi*. If the face becomes flushed as if intoxicated, this indicates stomach heat surging upward to steam the face—add rhubarb (*dahuang*) to drain it. The formula is: [lacuna].

Rhubarb (*dahuang*), Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), Asarum (*xixin*), and Licorice (*gancao*) each three *liang*; Poria (*fuling*) four *liang*; Schisandra (*wuweizi*), Pinellia (*banxia*), and Apricot kernel (*xingren*) each half a *sheng*.
Grind the eight ingredients, decoct in one *dou* of water to obtain three *sheng*, strain, and take half a *sheng* warm three times daily.

For cough with rising *qi*, lung distension, a floating pulse, water-*qi* beneath the heart, and hypochondriac pain radiating to the supraclavicular fossa—if there is repletion, the patient will inevitably be restless, often leaning forward in a hunched posture—Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction with Gypsum governs. The formula is:
Gypsum, Dried ginger (*ganjiang*), Cinnamon bark (*guixin*), and Asarum (*xixin*) each two *liang*; Peony (*shaoyao*) and Licorice (*gancao*) each three *liang*; Ephedra (*mahuang*) four *liang*; Pinellia (*banxia*) half a *sheng*; Schisandra (*wuweizi*) one *sheng*.

Place the mouth of a bamboo tube over the medicine, inhale one cluster at a time, and swallow, ensuring the powder enters the abdomen. Take three clusters before meals daily for four days. Prepare another seven-star cluster, roast a piece of meat until cooked, then roll the medicine clusters over it until fully coated. Lie supine, chew the meat slowly, swallowing the juice bit by bit, allowing the medicine’s power to permeate gradually. When the toxic qi enters the throat, the medicine’s potency will act decisively. Once the medicine is fully consumed, swallow the residue to complete the cure. If not yet cured, repeat as before.
Lamb, beef, or venison may be used; pork is unsuitable.

**Fumigation Method for Cough Treatment:**
Spread a thin layer of prepared mugwort (*Artemisia argyi*) on paper, four inches in width. Then evenly sprinkle sulfur powder over the mugwort. Cut a reed stalk to match the paper’s length, roll it into ten cylinders, and ignite the lower end to remove the reed. Inhale the smoke through the mouth and swallow until vomiting ceases. Repeat the next morning as before. Perform this once or twice daily until natural recovery. Consume only white rice porridge; all other foods are forbidden. (Note: This fumigation resembles sulfur, which may ignite when exposed to fire.)

**Alternative Formula:**
Grind one *liang* of fumigation sulfur finely. Mix it with wax paper until fully incorporated, then roll as in the previous method. Fumigate following the same procedure, performing once or twice daily until vomiting occurs. After seven days of rest, consume mutton broth to restore strength.

**Another Formula:**
Take a four-inch-wide strip of worn blue cloth and layer it as follows: mugwort on the cloth, then green vitriol powder over the mugwort, a small amount of fumigation sulfur over the vitriol, a pinch of salt, and finally a sprinkle of fermented soybean powder. Roll tightly, ignite, and place in a dry jar. Cover the jar’s mouth with paper, leaving a small hole. Inhale the smoke through the mouth and swallow slowly until vomiting occurs. If chest tightness arises, pause briefly; cease when the smoke is exhausted. Perform once or twice daily, using three rolls for a complete cure. Avoid greasy foods for twenty-one days.

**Discourse:**
For conditions of rising *qi*, many recover through emetic remedies, while others find relief through acupuncture and moxibustion. One should deeply contemplate and discern the appropriate approach.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
For cough, apply one hundred moxa cones to the black-white boundary below each nipple; this will cure the condition.

Alternatively, encircle the body with a rush mat aligned with the nipples, ensuring front and back are level. Apply ten moxa cones at the midpoint where the mat meets the spine.

Another method: Measure the mouth’s width with a string, fold it, and align it along the spine. Apply eighty moxa cones at each end of the string, repeating three times over three days. The string’s length corresponds to the mouth’s width.

For rising *qi*, apply moxa cones to the sixth vertebral interspace below the fifth vertebra (the *Shendao* point), with the number of cones matching the patient’s age.

For rising *qi*, cough, shortness of breath, fullness, and inability to eat, apply fifty moxa cones to the lung’s *mu* point.

For rising *qi*, counterflow cough, shortness of breath, wind taxation, and all diseases, apply two hundred moxa cones to *Jianjing*.

For rising *qi*, shortness of breath, cough, counterflow, chest and back pain, apply one hundred moxa cones to *Fengmen* (Heat Palace).

For rising *qi*, counterflow cough, chest fullness, shortness of breath, and back pain, apply fifty moxa cones each to *Juque* and *Qimen*.

For rising *qi*, shortness of breath, counterflow cough, chest fullness, excessive spittle, and expectoration of cold, foul phlegm, apply fifty moxa cones to the lung’s *shu* point.

For rising *qi*, chest fullness, shortness of breath, and counterflow cough, apply fifty moxa cones to *Yunmen*.

For rising *qi*, chest impediment, and back pain, apply one hundred moxa cones to *Xiongtang* (do not needle).

For rising *qi* and counterflow cough, apply fifty moxa cones to *Shanzhong*.

For rising *qi*, *qi* blockage, counterflow cough, cold throat, hoarse voice, and wheezing, apply fifty moxa cones to *Tianqu* (also called *Tiantu*).

For counterflow *qi*, taxation fatigue, cold damage, sorrow-induced illness, sinew and bone spasms, heart counterflow cough, diarrhea, *zhù* disease, abdominal fullness, throat impediment, stiff neck, intestinal hemorrhoids, counterflow *qi*, hemorrhoid bleeding, genital urgency, nosebleed, bone pain, difficulty with urination or defecation, nasal dryness, vexation and fullness, manic wandering, and *yi* *qi*—twenty-two diseases in total—apply fifty moxa cones to *Juegu*. The point is located three *cun* above the external malleolus, in the depression.

**Formulas for the Large Intestine Repository: Sixth Discourse on Phlegm-Rheum – Formulas and Moxibustion Methods**

The Master said: "Rheum has four types. What are they?"
The Teacher replied: "There is *phlegm-rheum*, *suspended rheum*, *overflowing rheum*, and *branch rheum*."
The Master asked: "How do the symptoms of the four rheums differ?"
The Teacher replied:
- "When a person was once robust but is now emaciated, with water flowing between the intestines producing a gurgling sound, this is called *phlegm-rheum*.
- When water flows into the flanks after drinking, causing pain upon coughing or spitting, this is called *suspended rheum*.
- When excessive water intake causes water to disperse into the four limbs, and though sweating should occur, it does not, leading to bodily pain and heaviness, this is called *overflowing rheum*.
- When a person coughs, leans to breathe, is short of breath, cannot lie down, and appears swollen, this is called *branch rheum*.

Whenever there is water beneath the heart, the patient experiences palpitations, shortness of breath, and fear, with dizziness and convulsions. If cold precedes, it is deficiency; if heat precedes, it is excess.
- Thus, when water is in the heart, the patient has a firm sensation beneath the heart, palpitations, shortness of breath, and an aversion to water without desire to drink.
- When water is in the lungs, the patient spits frothy saliva and desires to drink water.
- When water is in the spleen, the patient is short of breath and the entire body feels heavy.
- When water is in the liver, the flanks feel full and supported, with pain upon sneezing.
- When water is in the kidneys, there are palpitations beneath the heart.

If a patient suddenly drinks too much water, they will experience sudden wheezing and fullness. Generally, when food intake is scant but drink is excessive, water stagnates beneath the heart—severe cases cause palpitations, while mild cases result in shortness of breath.
- A pulse that is doubly wiry indicates cold, often due to excessive purging leading to deficiency.
- A pulse that is wiry on one side indicates rheum.
- *Lung rheum* is not wiry but characterized by wheezing and shortness of breath.
- *Branch rheum* also involves wheezing and inability to sleep, with added shortness of breath, though the pulse remains normal.
- *Lingering rheum* does not manifest outwardly, lacks heat, and has a faint pulse, with vexation, fullness, and inability to eat. A deep and slippery pulse indicates *lingering rheum*.

When *lingering rheum* is present, pain in the flank radiates to the supraclavicular fossa, worsening with coughing. The patient coughs but cannot lie down, with pain radiating upward to the neck, and the cough resembles a child’s convulsive jerking.
- When there is *lingering rheum* in the chest, the patient is short of breath and thirsty.
- When the four limbs and joints ache and the pulse is deep, *lingering rheum* is present.
- When there is *lingering rheum* beneath the heart, the patient’s back feels cold, as large as a hand.
- When a patient’s breathing is labored and elevated, this indicates *overflowing rheum* in the chest. Over time, the supraclavicular fossa becomes full, and *horse-blade* swellings appear, with severe episodes—this is caused by *qi-rheum*.

For disorders above the diaphragm, fullness, wheezing, coughing, and vomiting occur, accompanied by alternating chills and fever, back pain, aversion to cold, spontaneous tearing, and severe bodily tremors—this indicates *hidden rheum*.
- When a patient’s arm is paralyzed, occasionally shifting to the other arm, with a deep and fine pulse, this is not wind but *rheum in the upper burner*.
- A deficient pulse indicates mild taxation, as the *ying* and *wei* qi fail to circulate properly, though recovery occurs in winter.
  - *Alternate text*: "Recovery occurs over time."

For *phlegm-rheum* disorders, warming medicinals should be used to harmonize them.

*Formulas from the Seventh Discourse on the Nine Worms.*

The Discourse states: Within the human abdomen dwell corpse-worms (*shichong*), entities born with man and inflicting grave harm. The corpse-worm’s form resembles a thick horse’s tail or a thin sinew, residing alongside the spleen. It possesses head and tail, each three *cun* in length.

There are also nine worms:
1. **Hidden Worm (*fuchong*)**: four *fen* long;
2. **Roundworm (*huichong*)**: one *chi* long;
3. **White Worm (*baichong*)**: one *cun* long;
4. **Flesh Worm (*rouchong*)**: shaped like rotted apricot;
5. **Lung Worm (*feichong*)**: shaped like a silkworm;
6. **Stomach Worm (*weichong*)**: shaped like a toad;
7. **Weak Worm (*ruochong*)**: shaped like melon pulp;
8. **Red Worm (*chichong*)**: shaped like raw flesh;
9. **Pinworm (*naochong*)**: exceedingly fine, resembling a cabbage grub.

The Hidden Worm governs the host of worms. When roundworms pierce the heart, they kill. White worms propagate, their progeny multiplying while the mother grows ever larger, reaching four to five *zhang* in length—also capable of killing. Flesh worms cause vexing fullness. Lung worms induce coughing. Stomach worms provoke vomiting, hiccups, and retching. Weak worms, also called diaphragm worms, cause excessive spittle. Red worms produce intestinal rumbling. Pinworms inhabit the intestines; in abundance, they cause hemorrhoids; in severe cases, they lead to scabies. Through human sores, they generate abscesses, ulcers, ringworm, fistulas, scrofula, scabies, and dental caries. There is no affliction they do not cause. Not all people harbor them, nor do all who do possess them in great numbers. Some may have only certain types, others none at all—women, however, commonly host more. These worms are fiercely malevolent, the bane of mankind. Regular bathing with *baiyan* grass is beneficial, as its roots and leaves may be used. Not only is it fragrant, but it is also feared by corpse-worms.

The Discourse states: Before taking restorative medicines or treating any ailment, one must first expel all worms, phlegm-rheum, and retained accumulations, purging them thoroughly. Only then may restorative medicines be taken; otherwise, their efficacy will not manifest.

There is no ailment it does not address.

If not cured, take again the next morning, and if still not cured, take on the third day. *Zhouhou* treats the three worms by steeping in wine and taking the liquid.

**Another formula:**

**Another formula:**
Take north-facing evodia roots, dry, remove soil, and cut one *sheng*. Steep in one *sheng* of wine overnight and take in two divided doses at dawn. All evodia should use fine roots, preferably those growing eastward or northward. Roots as thick as a finger or larger are unsuitable.

It is said: Those suffering from cold damage or epidemic febrile diseases with abdominal heat, or those who eat little, leaving the intestines and stomach empty, will have the three worms become active seeking food, gnawing at the five viscera and lower body. If the gums lose color, the tongue turns entirely white, or in severe cases, sores appear on the lips, limbs feel heavy, and one is drowsy and lethargic, frequently check the upper lip—if sores are present, spitting blood, or millet-like sores appear inside the lips, with anguished pain and oppression in the heart, the worms are above, gnawing the five viscera. If sores appear inside the lower lip, and the person is drowsy, the worms are below, gnawing the lower body—this is often unnoticed. Take worm-eradicating medicine, or else the worms will kill the person.

It is also said: Those suffering from damp *shen* often develop it after febrile diseases, prolonged diarrhea, or when residual heat lingers in the abdomen, or when adapting to new water and soil, or when affected by cold-damp qi—this ailment frequently arises. There is also dry *shen*, without severe diarrhea, but with sores and itching in the lower body. Regardless of dry or damp, prolonged cases are fatal. For damp cases with cold-induced diarrhea, simply boil coptis, mugwort, or *kushen*—all may be used. If the patient’s gums lose color, the tongue turns white, or they are drowsy, agitated, and unaware of pain, or have diarrhea, urgently treat the lower body. Those unfamiliar with this focus only on the upper body, neglecting the lower, where worms grow, gnawing the anus until it rots, exposing the viscera—then death follows. Burn mugwort in a bamboo tube to fumigate.

**For treating cold damage and *ji* disease:**
Take a raw egg, tap the small end to remove the white, add one *ge* of lacquer, stir thoroughly until frothy, then return it to the shell and swallow whole. After a meal’s time or half a day, the patient will vomit worms. In severe cases, take again—the worms will be expelled, heat removed, and the disease cured.

- Musk: two *fen*

Grind and sift the above five ingredients. Insert a piece the size of a small jujube into the lower body at dawn. For severe cases, use a piece the size of a jujube, mix with two or three *ge* of axle grease, and pour into the lower body, twice daily.

**Realgar and Apricot Kernel Powder, for seasonal epidemic disease with *shen* and sores in the lower body:**
- Realgar: half a *liang*
- Apricot kernels: one *liang*
- Qingxiang seeds: three *liang*
- Coptis: three *liang*
- *Kushen*: three *liang*

Grind into powder, wrap in silk the size of a jujube pit, and insert into the lower body. May also take one *fangcunbi* with jujube juice, three times daily.

**For *shen* worms:**
Burn horse hooves to ash, grind into powder, mix with lard, apply to a cotton rope, and insert into the lower body, four or five times daily.

**For itching in the anal passage:**
Steam jujubes to extract their syrup, mix with mercury, shape into a three-inch length, wrap in silk, and insert into the anal passage overnight. By dawn, all worms will emerge. Mercury harms the intestines; use with caution.

**For worms gnawing the lower body:**
- Lead powder
- Realgar

Take equal parts of each, grind into powder, and apply to the anal passage. Also treats children.

**For febrile disease with excessive sleep, transforming into damp *shen*, vexing pain in the limbs, and inability to eat:**
Cut ten *jin* of yangtao, pound thoroughly, soak in three *dou* of warm water. At noon, sit in the infusion for the duration of a meal. No more than three treatments are needed for a cure.

**For heat disease with *gudu* toxin, causing excessive sleep, insensitivity to pain, flushed face like drunkenness, and bloody pus in the stool:**
Frequently examine the patient’s lower body. If the anal passage appears red and swollen (or rough), it indicates *shen* sores, a severe condition that can be fatal. If the worms are seen attacking the liver and lungs, and medicine proves ineffective, fumigation may be used:

Make a small clay jar holding one *sheng*, with a bamboo tube the size of a finger. Insert one end horizontally into the jar’s belly and the other into the anal passage, shallowly. Take a piece of well-aged mugwort the size of a chicken’s egg, place it in the jar, and ignite. Blow the smoke from the jar’s mouth into the patient’s abdomen. Stop when the mugwort is exhausted. Adults may use more mugwort; children, less. The weak should not use too much, as excess may harm. Fumigate twice daily; no more than three treatments are needed for the worms to die and the condition to cease. Alternatively, grind and burn realgar for fumigation.

**Formulas for the Kidney Viscus**
**Discourse on the Kidney Viscus and Its Pulse (Chapter One)**

The discourse states: The kidney governs essence. The kidney is the root of innate spirit and vitality, serving as the inner palace’s sovereign—thus, the female ruler. What Heaven bestows upon me is virtue; what Earth bestows upon me is qi. Life arises from the interplay of virtue’s flow and qi’s convergence.

Hence, what is received at birth is called *essence*; essence is stored in the kidney. The ear is the kidney’s official; kidney qi communicates with the ear. When the ear is harmonious, one can discern the five notes. The kidney’s orifice is the ear, yet kidney qi ascends to the ear and descends to the yin. The left kidney corresponds to *ren*, the right to *gui*, circulating through the Mysterious Palace. Above, it emerges at the ear’s gate to survey the four directions; below, it returns to the Jade Sea, flanking the spine on either side, level with the navel. It courses through the upper burner, nourishes the middle burner, and defends the lower burner. Externally, it governs the bones; internally, it governs the bladder.

The kidney weighs one *jin* and one *liang*, comprising two lobes. Its spirit is named *Yuyu*, presiding over essence storage—hence its designation as the *Essence Viscus*. It responds to seasonal nodes, thus it is said: the kidney stores essence, and essence houses the will. In qi, it manifests as yawning; in fluids, as spittle.

When kidney qi is deficient, reversal cold arises; when excessive, distension and fullness occur, and the four limbs turn dark. Deficiency causes dreams of boats, drowning victims, or—if aligned with the season—lying submerged in water, as if gripped by fear. When kidney qi is exuberant, one dreams of the waist and spine separating, no longer connected. If reversal qi invades the kidney, one dreams of standing at an abyss or dwelling submerged in water.

The kidney viscus resembles water and pairs with the bladder as its fu. Its channel is the Foot Lesser Yin, which stands in exterior-interior relation with the Greater Yang. Its pulse is deep, corresponding to autumn and ruling in winter. In winter, all things are stored away; the hundred insects hibernate. Yang qi sinks downward, yin qi rises upward. Yang qi emerges from within, while yin qi congeals into frost, no longer ascending, transforming into frost and snow. Fierce beasts hibernate, and wasps conceal themselves.

Its pulse is deep—deepness pertains to yin, residing in the interior. One must not induce sweating, for doing so would be like wasps emerging to encounter frost and snow. When yin qi is at the exterior and yang qi in the viscus, one must not precipitate purgation, lest the spleen be harmed. If spleen earth weakens, water qi will flow recklessly, like fish leaping from water or moths plunging into boiling liquid.

When a severe pathogen lingers in the interior, one must not apply moxibustion, for it would drive the pathogen inward, causing panting. Do not cling to the heat of the pathogen, lest it ulcerate the mouth. When yin vessels slacken and blood scatters, failing to circulate, true yang reverses, and yin cannot follow. The invading heat rages inward, forming chest bind; spleen qi weakens further, and clear urine flows as dysentery.

The winter pulse resembles *ying*—the winter pulse is the kidney, the water of the north, the season when all things converge and store. Thus, its qi arrives deep and forceful—this is called *ying*. If it deviates from this, it indicates illness.

What constitutes deviation? If its qi arrives like flicking a stone, this is called *excess*, and the illness lies in the exterior.

When its departure is rapid as if counting, this is called *insufficiency*, and the illness lies within. Excess causes one to feel slack, with pain alongside the spine and shortage of qi, disinclined to speak. Insufficiency causes one’s heart to feel suspended as if famished, with cold in the hollow of the flank, pain in the spine, fullness in the lower abdomen, and urine turning reddish-yellow.

The kidney pulse arrives panting, layered like a hook—pressing it, it feels firm: this is normal. In winter, the pulse takes the stomach qi as its root. If the kidney pulse arrives like pulling creeping vines, pressing it grows firmer, this is kidney disease. If the kidney pulse arrives as if snatching a rope, snapping like flicking a stone, this is kidney death. When the true kidney pulse arrives, forceful yet vanishing—like flicking a stone with a finger, snapping sharply—its complexion yellow-black and lusterless, body hair withered, death follows.

A winter pulse with slight stoniness is normal; stoniness abundant and stomach qi scant is kidney disease; stoniness alone without stomach qi is death. If stoniness is accompanied by hooking, this portends summer illness; if hooking is severe, illness is present. All people take water and grain as their root, thus one who is cut off from water and grain dies; a pulse without stomach qi also dies. What is meant by "without stomach qi"? It is when only the true visceral pulse is obtained, without stomach qi. What is meant by "a pulse without stomach qi"? It is when the liver pulse is not stringlike, the kidney pulse not stonelike.

The kidney stores essence, and essence houses the will. Unceasing rage injures the will; when the will is injured, one is prone to forgetfulness, with pain in the waist and spine, unable to bend or stretch, body hair withered, complexion ashen—death comes in late summer.

When the qi of the foot *shaoyin* is cut off, the bones wither. *Shaoyin* is the winter pulse, traveling deep and moistening the bones and marrow. Thus, if the bones are not moistened, flesh cannot adhere to them. When bone and flesh lose their affinity, the flesh becomes flaccid and recedes. As flesh recedes, the teeth lengthen and grow foul, the hair loses its luster—when the hair loses its luster, the bones die first. Death comes on *wu* (severe) or *ji* (critical) days, for earth overcomes water.

When the kidney is a dead viscus, floating it feels firm, pressing it chaotic like rolling pellets—if it grows more pronounced in the *chi* region, death follows.

In winter, when kidney-water flourishes, its pulse is deep, soft, and slippery: this is normal. If instead it is faint, rough, and short, this is the lung overacting on the kidney—mother returning to child, a vacuity evil, though the illness is easily treated. If instead it is stringlike, fine, and long, this is the liver overacting on the kidney—child overbearing mother, a repletion evil, though the illness resolves on its own. If instead it is large and moderate, this is the spleen overacting on the kidney—earth restraining water, a bandit evil, a grave reversal: ten deaths, no cure. If instead it is floating, large, and surging, this is the heart overacting on the kidney—fire bullying water, a minor evil, though the illness soon abates.

When the yin pulse at the *chi* region behind the left bar is cut off, there is no kidney pulse. One suffers heat in the soles, tension in the inner thighs, exhaustion of essence and qi from overwork—treat by needling the foot *taiyang* to regulate yang. When the yin pulse at the *chi* region behind the left bar is replete, this is kidney repletion. One suffers absentmindedness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, throat constriction, tinnitus with a rushing sound—treat by needling the foot *shaoyin* to regulate yin.

When the yin pulse at the *chi* region behind the right bar is cut off, there is no kidney pulse. One suffers cold reversal in the feet, pain shooting upward to the chest, dreams of entering water and seeing ghosts, frequent nightmares, and black apparitions looming over one—treat by needling the foot *taiyang* to regulate yang. When the yin pulse at the *chi* region behind the right bar is replete, this is kidney repletion. One suffers bone pain, lumbar and spinal pain, internal cold and heat—treat by needling the foot *shaoyin* to regulate yin.

The kidney pulse is deep, fine, and tight. Arriving twice per breath is normal; thrice is departure from the norm, an illness; four times is loss of essence; five times is death; six times is the end of life—this is the foot *shaoyin* pulse.

If the kidney pulse is extremely rapid, it causes bone wilting and epilepsy; if slightly rapid, it causes running piglet, cold reversal, inability to draw the feet in, and difficulty with urination and defecation. If extremely moderate, it causes spinal fracture; if slightly moderate, it causes penetrating diarrhea—food is not digested, swallowed food returns. If extremely large, it causes impotence; if slightly large, it causes stone water, swelling that begins below the navel, distending the lower abdomen, rising to the stomach duct—incurable and fatal. If extremely small, it causes penetrating diarrhea; if slightly small, it causes wasting-thirst.

If the kidney pulse is extremely slippery, it causes urinary blockage; if slightly slippery, it causes bone wilting—unable to rise when seated, eyes seeing nothing, vision filled with black spots. If extremely rough, it causes large abscesses; if slightly rough, it causes amenorrhea and internal hemorrhoids.

When the kidney pulse is forceful, firm, and long, with a complexion yellow and red, one will suffer from broken waist. If the pulse is soft and scattered, one will suffer from blood deficiency.

When the black pulse arrives—firm and large above—there is accumulated *qi* in the lower abdomen and genitals, called kidney impediment. This is contracted from bathing in cold water and then lying down.

Bian Que said: When the kidney is diseased, the ears become deaf. The kidney’s orifice is the ear; thus, kidney *qi* ascends to communicate with the ear. If the five viscera are disharmonious, the nine orifices become blocked. When both yin and yang are excessive and fail to nourish each other, this is called *guan ge*. In *guan ge*, one will not live out one’s allotted span and will die.

The kidney governs groaning in sound, shuddering in movement, and fear in emotion. Fear harms the kidney; when essence and *qi* converge in the kidney, fear arises.

The viscera govern winter diseases; for diseases in the viscera, select the *jing*-well points. When disease first arises in the kidney, the vaginal opening and lumbar spine ache, and the channels turn sour. After one day, it reaches the bladder—back and spinal sinews ache, and urination is blocked. After two days, it ascends to the heart—heart pain. After three days, it reaches the small intestine—distension. If it persists to the fourth day, death follows. In winter, [treatment should be given at] early dawn; in summer, at late afternoon.

When the disease is in the kidney, clarity comes at midnight, decline at noon, exacerbation at the four seasonal transitions, and calm at late afternoon.

If kidney disease is contracted, it may arise from eating beef or other things from the earth; otherwise, it will manifest in late summer, with onset on *wu-ji* days.

The signs of kidney disease are invariably abdominal distension, swollen and painful shins, panting, coughing, heaviness of the body, night sweats, and aversion to wind. In deficiency, there is pain in the chest, upper abdomen, and lower abdomen, cold reversal, and dispiritedness. Select the blood from the foot *shaoyin* and *taiyang* channels.

When the kidney pulse is deep, large, and firm, or floating, large, and tight, one suffers from swollen bones in the hands and feet, reversal cold with impotence, lumbar and spinal pain, lower abdominal swelling, water *qi* below the heart, and alternating distension with blockage or diarrhea. This is contracted from bathing in water, engaging in sexual intercourse before the body is dry, or from overwork and fatigue.

In kidney disease, the complexion is black, the *qi* is weak and feeble, breathing is shallow, the ears suffer deafness, the waist aches, essence is frequently lost, food intake diminishes, and the area below the knees is cold. If the pulse is deep, slippery, and slow, this is treatable. It is appropriate to administer the *Internal Supplementation Powder*, *Center-Fortifying Decoction*, *Kidney Qi Pill*, and *Rehmannia Elixir*.

In spring, one should needle *Yongquan*; in autumn, *Fuliu*; in winter, *Yingu*—all with supplementation. In summer, needle *Rangu*; in late summer, *Taixi*—all with drainage.

Additionally, one should moxa *Jingmen* with fifty cones and the fourteenth vertebra of the back with one hundred cones.

When pathogenic *qi* lodges in the kidneys, there is bone pain and *yin* impediment. In *yin* impediment, pressure fails to locate the pain; there is abdominal distension, lumbar pain, difficulty with defecation, stiffness and pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and nape, and occasional dizziness. Treat by needling *Yongquan* and *Kunlun*, and where blood is visible, drain it completely.

If one overexerts in lifting heavy objects or engages in excessive sexual intercourse, sweating as though bathed in water, the kidneys will be injured. There are conditions such as *wind invading the kidneys* and *cold invading the kidneys*.

In *kidney water*, the patient’s abdomen is enlarged, the navel swollen, the waist painful, urination obstructed, and the area beneath the genitals damp with sweat like an ox’s nose; the feet are cold and reversed, and the stool is paradoxically hard. Some say the face is emaciated instead.

In *kidney distension*, the abdomen is full and pulls at the back with a dull, dragging sensation, and there is pain in the waist and hips (or impediment).

In *kidney attachment disease*, the patient’s body feels heavy, the lumbar region cold as if immersed in water (or as if washed with water, or as if sitting in water), yet there is no thirst, urination is unobstructed, and appetite and drinking remain normal—these are its signs. The disease pertains to the lower burner, arising from physical labor with sweating, followed by exposure to cold dampness in clothing, leading to its chronic onset. In *kidney attachment disease*, there is cold below the waist and a sensation of carrying five thousand coins in the lumbar region.

When diagnosing *kidney accumulation*, the pulse is deep and rapid, with pulling pain between the spine and waist; the pain appears when hungry and lessens when full. The lower abdomen is tense, the mouth dry, the throat swollen and ulcerated, the eyes [text missing], the bones cold, and there is *marrow reversal*, forgetfulness, and a black complexion.

The kidney’s accumulation is called *Running Piglet*, arising in the lower abdomen and surging upward to below the heart, resembling a piglet running back and forth without fixed timing. If it persists without cure, there will be panting counterflow, bone wilting, and shortness of breath. Why is it contracted on *bing*-*ding* days in summer? When the spleen’s disease transmits to the kidneys, the kidneys should transmit to the heart, but the heart is in its phase of dominance in summer and thus does not receive the pathogenic *qi*. The kidneys then attempt to return it to the spleen, but the spleen refuses to accept it, causing it to congeal and form an accumulation. Thus, *Running Piglet* is contracted in summer.

In kidney disease, the hands and feet are cold and reversed, the face is red, the eyes yellow, urination is uncontrolled, the joints ache painfully, the lower abdomen is bound with pain, and *qi* surges into the heart. The pulse should be deep, fine, and slippery, but if it is instead floating and large, and the complexion should be black but is instead yellow, this indicates earth overwhelming water—a great counterflow. It is incurable, and the patient will die within ten days.

The *yu* tone corresponds to the kidneys’ sound. The sound of the kidneys is groaning, its note is *se*, its emotion is fear, and its channel is the foot *Shaoyin*.

When *reversal counterflow* affects the *Taiyang*, the *ying* and *wei* do not circulate, *yin* and *yang* invert their positions, *yang qi* hides internally, and *yin qi* rises externally. When it rises, there is cold; when cold, there is vacuity; and when vacuous, it is vulnerable to *li* wind. Speech is slurred and inarticulate, there is hemiplegia, and the feet are lopsided and lame. If the left side is affected, the left kidney is injured; if the right, the right kidney. In *hemiplegic wind*, the body is divided from the nose downward to the feet, with one side slack and weak, unable to move; the mouth is also crooked, speech is muddled, urination and defecation require assistance, hearing is unilaterally deaf and obstructed, and the waist and back pull at each other. In severe cases, it is incurable, and *Kidney Dribble Decoction* governs it. The formula is found in another volume.

Furthermore, groaning with frequent resentment, resentment with forgetfulness, and absentminded preoccupation—this indicates earth overwhelming water, *yang* striking *yin*, *yin qi* lying hidden while *yang qi* rises. When it rises, there is heat; when hot, there is repletion; when replete, there is anger; and when angry, there is forgetfulness. Hearing is impaired, the four limbs are tense and urgent, urine is reddish-yellow, speech moves the mouth but produces no sound, and the patient laughs while gazing at others. This is *pathogenic heat damaging the kidneys*, and in severe cases, it is incurable. If the face is blackish-yellow and the ears do not respond, it may still be treated.

When kidney disease manifests as malaria, it causes a chilly sensation, lumbar and spinal pain with writhing, difficulty with defecation, blurred vision, bodily trembling without stability, cold hands and feet, and is governed by *Changshan Decoction*. The formula is found in another volume.

If a person who originally does not stutter suddenly begins to stutter and is prone to anger, contrary to their usual nature, the kidneys are already injured. Though the disease has not yet manifested, these are its signs: seeing someone and opening the mouth to laugh before speaking, then closing it without a sound, or raising the hand to shield the abdomen (or rub the eyes)—these are the vocal signs of kidney disease.

Assess vacuity and repletion, exterior and interior, floating and sinking, clear and turbid, and treat accordingly.

Black corresponds to the kidneys, and the kidneys govern the bones. A black complexion like a crow’s feathers is auspicious. The kidneys govern the ears, and the ears are the kidneys’ surplus. The kidney type resembles the *upper yu* water phase: black complexion, large head, curved face, broad cheeks, small shoulders, large abdomen, small hands and feet, swaying gait, long lower body, and an extended back. Such individuals are disrespectful and fearful, adept at deception, and may die by execution. They endure autumn and winter but not spring and summer; if they contract illness in spring or summer, it pertains to the foot *Shaoyin*, with a murky, turbid presentation.

The size, height, thickness, and roundness of the ears correspond to the kidneys. A proper black complexion with fine texture indicates small kidneys; small kidneys are stable and difficult to injure. Coarse texture indicates large kidneys; large kidneys are vacuous, and vacuous kidneys lead to kidney cold, deafness or tinnitus, sweating, lumbar pain preventing bending forward or backward, and vulnerability to pathogenic *qi*.

High ears indicate high kidneys; high kidneys are replete, and replete kidneys lead to kidney heat, back tension and pain, ear discharge of pus or blood, or fleshy growths obstructing the ears. Sunken ears behind indicate low kidneys; low kidneys cause lumbar and sacral pain, inability to bend forward or backward, and *fox-like mounting*. Firm ears indicate firm kidneys; firm kidneys do not contract disease and do not suffer lumbar pain. Thin ears indicate fragile kidneys; fragile kidneys are vulnerable to heat, and heat causes ear ringing and susceptibility to *wasting-thirst*. Ears well-positioned in front of the jaw indicate well-aligned kidneys; well-aligned kidneys are harmonious and beneficial, difficult to injure.

Ears that are unevenly high indicate uneven kidneys; uneven kidneys lead to frequent unilateral lumbar and sacral pain. In all people, if the bone in a designated diagnostic region is sunken, death is inevitable. The regions flanking the bladder and alongside the *Taiyang* channel correspond to the kidneys; if the bone in these areas is sunken, the condition manifests accordingly. For the visceral *qi* communicates between interior and exterior, and the diagnostic regions respond in kind. The deep and turbid pertain to the interior, while the superficial and clear pertain to the exterior. If the complexion shifts from exterior to interior, the disease arises externally, and the diagnostic region becomes prominent. If the complexion shifts from interior to exterior, the disease arises internally, and the diagnostic region becomes sunken. For internal diseases, first treat the *yin*, then the *yang*; for external diseases, first treat the *yang*, then the *yin*. The *yang* governs the exterior, the *yin* governs the interior.

In all matters of life, death, fortune, or misfortune, the spirits of the viscera first alter their forms externally. When the kidneys are ailing, the ears become withered and parched; if the kidneys are near death, the ears become □, blackened, withered, and scabbed. If the complexion at the *Tianzhong* region and its corresponding areas darkens at dusk, the condition is fatal and untreatable. Observe the changes in the corresponding signs, weighing whether the course is prolonged or hastened: if prolonged, death will not occur within four hundred days; if hastened, it will come within ten to thirty days.

How can one know if a kidney disease, though slightly improved, will suddenly turn fatal? It is said: if a yellow-black macule the size of a thumb appears near the ear, sudden death is certain. When the kidneys are exhausted, death occurs in four days. How can this be known? The teeth turn abruptly black, the face becomes truly black, the eyes turn yellow, the waist feels as if it will break, profuse cold sweat streams forth, the face turns black and the eyes turn blue (or white)—this indicates internal injury to the kidney *qi*, with the disease lingering and accumulating. Death will come in eight days; these are the signs of mortal transformation.

A yellow face with black eyes does not indicate death, but if the blackness resembles that of the newly deceased, the complexion of fortune or misfortune must be assessed at the *Tianzhong* region and its corresponding areas. If the color on the left or right is abnormal, this pertains to the *yin* and *yang* offices of fate. According to physiognomic methods, if no official misfortune befalls the person yet the signs indicate death, then one whose face and eyes bear a yellow-black hue extending to the ears on both sides will die within a hundred days if over forty years of age. If the discoloration is confined to one side, it is most inauspicious and death is certain. If present on both sides but absent above the years, calamity will strike within three years.

In winter, the kidney pulse corresponds to the color black, governing the Foot Minor Yin meridian. Why does the Minor Yin govern the kidneys? It is said: the kidneys rule *yin*, and *yin* is water, all of which originates from the kidneys. This meridian is called the *Great Thoroughfare* (*Taichong*), comprising fifty-seven points in total. In winter, one selects the *well* and *spring* points. Winter is when water begins its governance, the kidneys close, *yang* qi declines and diminishes, *yin* qi solidifies and flourishes, and the *Taiyang* qi sinks and recedes, causing the *yang* pulse to depart. Thus, the *well* point is selected to descend the counterflow of *yin* qi, and the *spring* point to replenish *yang* qi (in *Plain Questions*, "replenish" is written as "consolidate").

The root of this meridian lies two *cun* below the inner ankle, corresponding to the two vessels beneath the tongue, with its foundation at *Gushing Spring* (*Yongquan*). *Gushing Spring* is located beneath the sole of the foot, at the sinew of the big toe. Its sinew originates below the little toe, enters the sole of the foot, converges with the *Taiyin* sinew, and obliquely travels to the inner ankle, binding at the heel. It joins the *Taiyang* sinew, ascends to bind beneath the inner knee, follows the *Taiyin* sinew upward along the inner thigh, binds at the genitals, ascends alongside the spine to the nape, binds at the occipital bone, and converges with the *Taiyang* sinew.

The meridian begins below the little toe, obliquely trends toward the sole of the foot, emerges beneath the *Stirrup Bone* (*Rangu*), follows the posterior aspect of the inner ankle, diverges into the heel, ascends along the inner shin, emerges at the popliteal fossa, follows the posterior inner thigh, penetrates the spine to connect with the kidneys, and networks with the bladder. Its straight branch ascends from the kidneys, penetrates the liver and diaphragm, enters the lungs, follows the throat, and flanks the root of the tongue. Its divergent branch emerges from the lungs, networks with the heart, and pours into the chest. It pairs with the Foot *Taiyang* as exterior and interior.

The root of the *Taiyang* lies five *cun* above the heel, converging with the Hand *Taiyin*. The collateral of the Foot Minor Yin, called *Great Bell* (*Dazhong*), circles behind the ankle and diverges to the *Taiyang*. Its divergent branch follows the meridian upward to the pericardium and descends to penetrate the lumbar spine. It governs kidney-generated diseases: when in excess, the bladder becomes hot, and heat causes blockage and *strangury*. Strangury then afflicts the *yang*, and the *yang* pulse reverses, becoming twice as large as the *cun* pulse. The symptoms include heat in the mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat, rising qi, dry and painful throat, vexation, heart pain, jaundice, intestinal afflux, pain along the posterior inner thigh and spine, atrophy and reversal, somnolence, heat and pain in the soles of the feet. Moxibustion induces forced eating and invites misfortune; loosening the belt, letting down the hair, leaning on a staff, and wearing heavy shoes while walking are advised.

When deficient, the bladder becomes cold, and cold causes lumbar pain. The pain causes the *yin* pulse to reverse, becoming smaller than the *cun* pulse. The symptoms include hunger without desire to eat, a face black as charcoal, blood in coughs and spittle, wheezing and panting, restlessness while seated, blurred vision, a heart suspended as if famished, and insufficient qi leading to frequent fear, with the heart palpitating as if someone were about to seize it—this is called *bone reversal*.

The three months of winter govern the kidneys and bladder, manifesting as *black bone warmth disease*. Its origin lies in the clash between *Taiyang* and Minor Yin, with stagnation accumulating in the *Triple Burner*, obstructing above and below. *Yin* toxin courses internally, and the viscera and bowels receive the guest qi of pathogenic influence, giving rise to illness—its symptoms are contradictory. If the *fu* is deficient, it is harmed by *yin* toxin, enveloping heat with external cold, prompting a desire for fire and inducing thirst, or lumbar pain as if broken. If the *zang* is in excess, it is damaged by *yang* warmth, causing cutting pain in the chest and ribs as if stabbed by a knife, inability to move, and surging heat. If cold medicine is overused, it may lead to unchecked diarrhea—hence, it is called *black bone warmth disease*.

Bian Que said: Moxibustion at the transport points of the spleen, liver, and kidneys governs the treatment of cinnabar, metal, and black warmth diseases. One should follow the source to regulate the viscera and bowels, preventing the onset of disorders arising from the clear and turbid.

**Kidney Deficiency and Excess: Pulse and Moxibustion Methods**

**Kidney Excess Heat**
When the *yin* pulse at the *Shenmen* point and beyond on the left *chi* position is replete, it pertains to the Foot Minor Yin meridian. The symptoms include dry tongue, swollen throat, heart vexation, dry throat, intermittent pain in the chest and ribs, panting, coughing, sweating, abdominal distension and fullness, lumbar and back stiffness, heaviness, bone heat, dark yellow urine, irritability, forgetfulness, heat and pain in the soles, blackened limbs, deafness—this is called *kidney excess heat*.

*The Classic of Pulse* states: In *kidney excess heat*, the symptoms include bladder distension and blockage, with pain radiating from the lower abdomen to the lumbar spine.

When the *yin* pulse at the *Shenmen* point and beyond on the right *chi* position is replete, it pertains to the Foot Minor Yin meridian. The symptoms include numbness, generalized heat, heart pain, pain radiating from the spine to the ribs, counterflow heat in the feet, and vexation—this is called *kidney excess heat*.

**On Kidney Taxation (Third Discussion)**
**Formulae**
It is said: For all kidney taxation disorders, tonify the liver *qi* to benefit them, for when the liver is strong, it influences the kidney. Those who oppose winter *qi* fail to store in the foot *Shaoyin*, causing kidney *qi* to sink and become turbid. Following the Dao brings life; opposing it brings death. Following it brings order; opposing it brings chaos. Reversing the proper order is termed *guange*, and disease arises.

**On Essence Exhaustion (Fourth Discussion)**
**Moxibustion Methods**
It is said: Essence exhaustion encompasses the pathological signs of the five viscera and six bowels. When the five viscera and six bowels decline, the entire body becomes exhausted: the eyes see without clarity, the teeth wither and hair falls out, the body feels heavy as kidney water arises, ears grow deaf, and gait becomes unsteady. Generally, yang pathogens harm the five viscera, while yin pathogens damage the six bowels. When yang is replete, it draws from yin to supplement yang; when yin is deficient, it draws from yang to supplement yin. In yang diseases, the upper body is primarily affected—elevation leads to repletion, repletion to heat, blurred vision, withered teeth and hair loss, abdominal fullness, and joint pain. Such pain warrants internal purgation. In yin diseases, the lower body is primarily affected—decline leads to deficiency, deficiency to cold, bodily heaviness as kidney water arises, deafness, and unsteady gait. When pathogenic qi enters internally and moves through the five viscera, coughing ensues, with copious nasal discharge and spittle, facial swelling, and counterflow qi. When pathogenic qi counterflows in the six bowels, it causes excessive deficiency and reversal in the five viscera—hence the term "essence exhaustion." Thus, when form is insufficient, warm it with qi; when essence is insufficient, supplement it with flavor. Those skilled in treating essence exhaustion first address the muscles, skin, sinews, and vessels, then the six bowels. If pathogens reach the five viscera, recovery is already half impossible. Bian Que said: When the five yin qi are all cut off, it is untreatable. Once severed, the eye connections twist, vision is lost, and the will dies first. Within a day or half a day, it is beyond medical reach. One must carefully discern, treating the exterior to address the interior, the left to treat the right, the right to treat the left, knowing oneself to know the other—then all illnesses may be cured.

**Fifth Discussion on Bone Exhaustion**
**Formulas and Moxibustion**

It is said: Bone exhaustion pertains to the kidneys. The kidneys correspond to the bones, and bones unite with the kidneys.
It is also said: When disease is encountered in winter, it is bone impediment. If bone impediment persists and is again assailed by evil, it lodges internally in the kidneys.
Tinnitus and the appearance of black complexion are its signs.
If the kidneys are diseased, then bone exhaustion arises: teeth ache severely, hands and feet suffer pain, one cannot stand for long, flexion and extension are impaired, the body is numb, and the brain marrow aches.
When in winter, on *ren* or *gui* days, one is struck by wind evil, this is kidney wind. Wind traverses the bones, hence it is called bone exhaustion.
If the *qi* is yin, then yin is vacuous; vacuity engenders cold. Cold causes facial swelling with grimy blackness, lumbar and spinal pain, inability to stand for long, and impaired flexion and extension.
When the *qi* declines, hair falls out and teeth wither. The waist and back pull upon each other in pain, and severe pain induces coughing and spitting.
If the *qi* is yang, then yang is replete; repletion engenders heat. Heat causes the face to be sooty, the private parts and bladder to become obstructed, teeth and brain marrow to ache severely, hands and feet to be sour and weak, tinnitus, and a black complexion—this is the extreme of bone exhaustion.
One must carefully distinguish yin and yang, examine their clarity and turbidity, know their divisions, and observe the breathing.
Those skilled in treating disease begin with the skin, sinews, and vessels; they must treat it promptly. If it enters the viscera and bowels, then half are dead.
Bian Que said: When the bones are cut off, there is cutting pain with inability to stretch or bend—death occurs in ten days.
The bones correspond to the foot lesser yin. When lesser yin *qi* is cut off, the bones wither, the hair loses its luster, and the bones die first.

**Three Yellows Decoction, for Bone Exhaustion, Kidney Heat Disease, Bladder Obstruction, Blockage of Urine and Stool, Withered Black Complexion, Tinnitus, and Vacuous Heat:**
- Rhubarb (soaked separately in one *sheng* of water)
- Scutellaria (3 *liang* each)
- Gardenia (14 pieces)
- Licorice (1 *liang*)
- Mirabilite (2 *liang*)

The above five ingredients are chopped. First decoct scutellaria, gardenia, and licorice in four *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and five *ge*. Remove the dregs, add rhubarb, and boil for two more simmerings. Add mirabilite, then divide into three doses.

**Moxibustion Methods:**
- For lumbar and back discomfort, sinew contracture, numbness, vacuous heat, and blockage: Moxa the twenty-first vertebra on both sides, one *cun* and five *fen* apart, one cone per year of age.
- For inhibited urination, abdominal distention and fullness, and vacuity fatigue: Moxa *Xiaochangshu* (BL 27), one cone per year of age.

**Sixth Discussion on Bone Vacuity and Repletion**
**Formulas and Moxibustion**

It is said: Bone vacuity causes sour pain and restlessness, with a tendency to fatigue. Bone repletion causes vexing heat.
Generally, the responses of bone vacuity and repletion pertain to the kidneys and bladder. If the bowels and viscera have disease, it arises from the bones. Heat corresponds to the viscera, and cold corresponds to the bowels.

**Tiger Bone Wine, for Bone Vacuity with Sour Pain, Restlessness, Fatigue, and Bladder Cold:**
- Tiger bones (1 set), thoroughly roasted until yellow and crisp, with all oil extracted. Crush into pieces the size of sparrow heads.
- Fermented rice (3 *shi*)
- Yeast (4 *dou*)
- Water (3 *shi*)

Prepare as in the usual method for brewing wine.

Thus, water and yeast are added because the bones dissolve the yeast and absorb the water—hence their inclusion. When the wine is mature, seal the jar for fifty days, then open it for drinking.

**For Bone Repletion with Vexing Heat, Sour Pain, and Restlessness:**
Boil the following:
- Kudzu root juice (1 *sheng*)
- Fresh Rehmannia root juice (1 *sheng*)
- Red honey (1 *sheng*)
- Wheat germ juice (5 *ge*)
Mix and stir these four ingredients together, then simmer over low heat until three or four boilings occur. Divide into three doses.

**For Pain in the Bone Marrow:**
- Tiger bone (4 *liang*)
- Peony root (1 *jin*)
- Fresh or dried Rehmannia root (5 *jin*)
Cut and chop these three ingredients, then steep in clear wine (1 *dou*) for three nights. Dry in the sun, then return to the wine, repeating until the wine is exhausted. Strain the mixture.
Take one square-inch spoonful of the wine daily, three times.

**For Cold in the Bone Marrow with Pain:**
Take Rehmannia root juice (1 *dan*) and wine (2 *dou*), mix and simmer repeatedly. Serve warm, three times daily. This supplements the marrow.

**Alternative Method:**
Moxibustion at the *Shang Lian* point (70 *zhuan*), three *cun* below *San Li*. This treats cold-induced exhaustion with weak, aching joints.

**For Exhaustion with Cold, Joint Pain, and Weakness:**
- Fermented soybean paste (2 *sheng*)
- Rehmannia root (8 *jin*)
Steam these two ingredients twice, dry in the sun, and make into a powder. After meals, take with wine (1 *sheng*), two square-inch spoonfuls, twice daily. This also treats *xū rè* (deficiency heat).

**Alternative Method:**
Powdered *Tian Men Dong* (Asparagus root), taken with wine (one square-inch spoonful), three times daily. Recovery occurs within one hundred days.

**Seventh Discussion on Lumbar Pain**
**Formulas, Guiding and Drawing Methods, Acupuncture and Moxibustion**

It is said: Lumbar pain has five causes:
1. *Shao Yin* (Minor Yin)—the kidneys—when in the tenth month, all things’ *yang qi* decline, hence lumbar pain;
2. *Wind Bi* (wind numbness), where wind and cold lodge in the lumbar region, hence lumbar pain;
3. Kidney deficiency, where excessive labor injures the kidneys, hence lumbar pain;
4. Kidney-lumbar strain, where falls or drops injure the lumbar region, hence lumbar pain;
5. Taking cold while sleeping on the ground, where the earth’s *qi* injures the body, hence lumbar pain—when the pain does not cease, it draws and stretches, causing lumbar and spinal pain.

**Duhuo Leisheng Decoction**
For those suffering from lumbar and dorsal pain—all such cases stem from **kidney qi** deficiency. Exposure to cold, dampness, or wind while reclining leads to this condition. If not treated promptly, it often descends into the legs and knees, manifesting as **hemiplegia**, **cold bi syndrome**, or **ataxic weakness with severe pain**. If lumbar pain is accompanied by leg stiffness, heaviness, or acute **bi syndrome**, this decoction is indicated. The prescription appears in another volume.

**Prescription for Lumbar and Spinal Pain with Impaired Mobility:**
Take **30 dou** of yellow soybeans, parch them to **10 dou**, then boil to **10 dou**, and steam to **10 dou**.

Remove the outer skin of **deer antler**, take only the white portion, parch until yellow, and grind into powder. Take with wine, **1 *fangcun* spoonful**, three times daily.
**Strictly avoid** raw fish; other dietary restrictions are general. Fresh antler is superior; aged or yellow-core antler is ineffective. **Superior-grade antler** is best.

**Another Prescription:**

---

**Prescription:**
Grind **sheep kidney** into powder. Take with wine, **two *fangcun* spoonfuls**, three times daily.

**Alternative Prescription:**
On the third day of the third month, collect **peach blossoms**, take **one *dou* and one *sheng*** of them, **well-water** three *dou*, **fermented malt** six *sheng*, and **rice** six *dou*. Cook and ferment the mixture for one hour, then strain out the dregs. Take **one *sheng*** per dose, three times daily. If used as a drink, prepare with **river water**. Observe the same dietary restrictions as the medicinal prescription; its efficacy is profound.

**Treatment for Male Coldness in the Lumbar Region and Legs (unable to walk):**
Mix **superior-grade refined wine** three *dou* with water three *dou*, combine in a ceramic vessel, and warm-soak the feet up to the knees. Continue for **three days**.

If coldness persists, keep a **ceramic container** beneath the feet with **ash fire** (smoldering embers), ensuring the feet never grow cold.

For **restless hands and feet**, warm-soak them in **three *sheng* of urine** in a basin.

**Guiding and Inducing Method for Lumbar and Kidney Pain:**
Sit facing east, hands clasped over the heart. One person kneels before the patient, pressing their knees, while another supports the patient’s head from behind. Gently pull the patient forward until they lie supine, head touching the ground, repeating this **three times**. The pain will then subside.

**Acupuncture and Moxibustion Method:**
For **lumbar and kidney pain**, needle the **Qūguān (決膝腰勾)**—the **blue-red meridian pathways** between the knee and lumbar region—until blood flows; the pain will then subside.

If **lumbar pain prevents bending or straightening**, have the patient stand upright. Measure **three *cun*** from the ground to the **navel** using a **bamboo rod** (#37), then break the rod. Use the broken segment to measure along the **spine** and apply moxibustion to the marked spot, adjusting the strength according to the patient’s age. After moxibustion, conceal the rod so the patient remains unaware.

For **lumbar pain**, apply moxibustion to the **horizontal lines** above the **heel** at the junction of white and red flesh, **ten times**—efficacious.

Also, apply moxibustion to **Zhúyáng (巨阳)** of the foot, **seven times**, located below the **lateral malleolus**.

Further, apply moxibustion to **Mùyī (目窌)** of the waist, **seven times**, found **above the sacrum**, approximately **left and right** of the midline.

Additionally, apply moxibustion to **Bāyī (八窌)** and the **bone above the lateral malleolus**.

For **sudden lumbar pain**, apply moxibustion to **Qiónggǔ (穷骨)**—the **upper edge of the sacrum**—**one *cun* above**, **seven times** on each side.

**Kidney Organ Formulas**

**Supplementing the Kidneys (Eighth Treatise)**

**Formulas**

**Moxibustion Treatise**
The Treatise states: The *Supplementing Formulas* universally treat the Five Exhaustions, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries of depletion. The Five Exhaustions refer to diseases of the five **zàng** organs*; the Six Extremes refer to diseases of the six **fǔ** viscera*; and the Seven Injuries pertain to superficial and encased illnesses*. The Five Exhaustions are:
1. **Exhaustion of the Will** (志劳),
2. **Exhaustion of Thought** (思劳),
3. **Exhaustion of Grief** (忧劳),
4. **Exhaustion of the Heart** (心劳),
5. **Exhaustion of Fatigue** (疲劳).

The Six Extremes are:
1. **Extreme of Qi** (气极),
2. **Extreme of Blood** (血极),
3. **Extreme of Sinews** (筋极),
4. **Extreme of Bones** (骨极),
5. **Extreme of Marrow** (髓极),
6. **Extreme of Essence** (精极).

The Seven Injuries are:
1. **Liver Injury** (肝伤), marked by frequent dreams;
2. **Heart Injury** (心伤), marked by forgetfulness;
3. **Spleen Injury** (脾伤), marked by excessive drinking;
4. **Lung Injury** (肺伤), marked by weakness and atrophy;
5. **Kidney Injury** (肾伤), marked by frequent spitting;
6. **Bone Injury** (骨伤), marked by constant hunger;
7. **Vessel Injury** (脉伤), marked by frequent coughing.

In general, excessive longing and strenuous contemplation deplete one; grief, anger, sorrow, and melancholy deplete one; excessive joy and mirth deplete one; unresolved rage and frustration deplete one; relentless pursuit of desires depletes one; ceaseless worry over afflictions depletes one; and failure to regulate exposure to cold and heat depletes one. Hence, they are called the Five Exhaustions, Six Extremes, and Seven Injuries. Though the Treatise enumerates many injuries, it speaks only briefly of them here; this formula addresses them all.

**Jianzhong Decoction** (建中汤), for treating the Five Exhaustions and Seven Injuries, acute lower abdominal pain, urinary bladder distension, hands and feet turning cold against the body’s will, difficulty swallowing and regurgitating sour phlegm, diarrhea, shortness of breath, dizziness, deafness, dry mouth, and frequent urination:
- **Honeyed Malt** (胶饴) **½ jīn**,
- **Astragalus** (黄耆) **#34** *three liang*,
- **Dry Ginger** (乾姜) **#35** *one liang*,
- **Angelica** (当归) **#36** *three liang*,
- **Ginseng** (人参) **#37** *two liang*,
- **Pinellia** (半夏) **#38** *two liang*,
- **Tangerine Peel** (橘皮) **#39** *two liang*,
- **White Peony** (芍药) **#40** *two liang*,
- **Licorice** (甘草) **#41** *two liang*,
- **Aconite** (附子) **#42** *one liang*,
- **Large Dates** (大枣) **#43** *fifteen pieces*.
These **eleven flavors**, finely chopped, are decocted in **one dōu** of water until reduced to **three shēng** and **half a shēng**. When the decoction is ready, add the **Honeyed Malt** and heat until it melts. Divide into four doses.

*The *Shēnshī* (深师)* version includes **Cassia Bark** (桂心) **six liang**, fresh ginger **one jīn**, and omits **Tangerine Peel** and **Dry Ginger**.

Another formula, for treating depletion and shortness of breath, abdominal distension and internal urgency, rigidity of the lower abdomen with coldness preventing flexion and extension, inability to eat, alternating chills and fever, headache, hands and feet turning cold against the body’s will, difficulty with urination and defecation, or recurring dysentery, dry mouth, seminal emission in dreams, occasional vomiting, disorientation, emaciation, slight edema, and aching of the limbs:

- **Astragalus** (黄耆) **#9** *three liang*,
- **Dragon Bone** (龙骨) **#10** *three liang*,
- **White Peony** (芍药) **#11** *four liang*,
- **Fresh Ginger** (生姜) **#12** *five liang*,
- **Honeyed Malt** (饴糖) **#13** *eight liang*,
- **Fresh Rehmannia** (生地黄) **#14** *one jīn*,
- **Large Dates** (大枣) **#15** *twenty-three pieces*.
These **fifteen flavors**, finely chopped, are decocted in **one dōu** and **two shēng** of water until reduced to **four shēng**. Remove the dregs, then add the **Honeyed Malt**. Take **eight hébā** per dose, three times daily and once at night. For coughing, double the amount of **Fresh Ginger**.

Another formula, for treating the Five Exhaustions and Seven Injuries, general depletion, sallow complexion, painful limbs, lumbar pain after prolonged standing, dizziness upon rising, acute lower abdominal pain with a sensation of severance, and external drawing of the four limbs:

These **six flavors**, finely chopped, are soaked overnight in **six shēng** of water. The next morning, add **five shēng** of water and decoct until reduced to **three shēng**. Divide into three doses.

The medicine permeates the four limbs and hundred vessels, inducing a sensation akin to drunkenness—this is its effect. If **Fresh Ginger** is unavailable, soak **Dry Ginger** (乾姜) **two liang** in wine overnight and use it instead. This formula is consistently miraculous when applied.

**Dà Jiànzhōng Decoction** (大建中汤), for treating depletion and **cold stagnation** (寒澼), fluid retention beneath the ribs with a gurgling sound, the sensation of fluid descending from one side with a gurgling noise, pain radiating to the breasts with a sensation of constriction, frequent dreams and seminal emission, shortness of breath, obscured vision, disorientation, and forgetfulness:

- **Pinellia** (半夏) **one shēng**,
- **Fresh Ginger** (生姜) **one jīn**,
- **Licorice** (甘草) **two liang**,
- **Ginseng** (人参) **three liang**,
- **Honeyed Malt** (饴糖) **eight liang**.
These **six flavors**, finely chopped, are decocted in **one dōu** of water until reduced to **three shēng**. Remove the dregs, add the **Honeyed Malt**, and warmly take **seven hébā** per dose.

For constriction and drawing pain, add **White Peony** (芍药) and **Cassia Bark** (桂心) **three liang** each;
For **limb reversal** (手足厥) and coldness in the lumbar and dorsal regions, add **Aconite** (附子) **one piece**;
For **Exhaustion of the Will**, add **Astragalus** (黄耆) **one liang**.

- **Astragalus** (黄耆) **#34** *three liang*,
- **Reishi** (远志) **#35** *three liang*,

These **eleven flavors**, finely chopped, are decocted in **one dōu** of water until reduced to **two shēng** and **half a shēng**. When the decoction is ready, add the **Honeyed Malt** and heat until it melts. Take **eight hébā** per dose, with an additional **eight hébā** as needed. The *Shēnshī* version omits **Honeyed Malt**, **Reishi**, **Alisma**, and **Dragon Bone**, but includes **Cassia Bark** (桂心) **six liang**, **Pinellia** (半夏) **one shēng**, and **Aconite** (附子) **one piece**.

**Xiǎo Jiànzhōng Decoction** (小建中汤), for treating both men and women suffering from accumulated depletion or failing to recover after severe illness, marked by **four-limb heaviness**, aching bones and flesh, **panting breath** (吸吸少气), labored movement, acute lower abdominal constriction, severe lumbar and dorsal pain, **palpitation** (心中虚悸), dry throat and lips, pallor of the face, loss of appetite, **weakness of yin and yang**, sorrow and melancholy, and a tendency to lie down with little rising.

**Nèi Bǔ Sǎn** (Internal Tonifying Powder), for treating **male exhaustion from the Five Strains and Six Extremes** (男子五劳六绝):
- If the **heart is injured**, the patient **startles easily, rages irrationally, and is unstable in mood** (令人善惊，妄怒无常).

- If the **kidneys are injured**, the patient **has masses, lower abdominal and lumbar distension, coughs with sputum, and difficult urination** (有积聚，小腹腰背满痹，咳唾，小便难).

These **Six Extremes** arise from **excessive labor depleting the pulse**, **external wind pathogens**, and **internal cold-heat imbalances**, causing **hand and foot pain, coldness below the knees, abdominal rumbling, frequent diarrhea (or constipation), facial swelling, and a dull, speechless state with aversion to sound** (手足疼痛，膝以下冷，腹中雷鸣，时时泄痢，或闭或利，面目肿，心下愦愦不欲语，憎闻人声):

These symptoms stem from **excessive alcohol, exposure to strong winds, sleeping on damp ground, or cold rising from below**, causing **lumbar coldness, leg weakness, qi deficiency, seminal exhaustion, cold in all vessels, dampness in the lower body, and genital atrophy** (腰以下冷，不足无气，子精虚，众脉寒，阴下湿，茎消), leading to **melancholy, disorientation, and occasional sorrow**. This formula **dispels wind, lightens the body, tonifies qi, brightens the eyes, strengthens the yin, promotes fertility, and restores deficiencies** (除风、轻身、益气、明目、强阴，令人有子，补不足):

Simmer the twenty-four ingredients in wine, adding more if needed, until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of *wúzǐ*. Take twenty pills with wine, three times daily, gradually increasing to forty.

If no pills are available, the decoction alone may be taken. This makes one plump, white, and robust.

**Deer Horn Pill:**
Use fresh antlers from the current year, including the brain cavity, as the finest. If the root shows signs of cutting, it is acceptable. Avoid flat-rooted antlers. Among the hundred and ten deer horn pill formulas, this one stands out—Chéngzǐ took it and transformed into a phoenix.

To prepare, take five (or four, three, two, or one) antlers. Cut off one *cùn* from the tip, leaving seven to eight *cùn* in length. Chop into pieces, pound into powder, and steep in flowing water in a bamboo container for ten nights.

If no flowing water is available, steep the mixture in a clean basin filled with water, changing it each night. Once the process is complete, scrape off the wrinkled skin, pound it finely to extract the white essence, and cease when done thoroughly. Then, with clean glutinous rice, steep the powder for two nights. After the first night, it will dry; squeeze out the old water, place it on fresh silk, and dry it in the sun. Purify and select the finest, discarding impurities, coarse bone skin, and unevenly pounded pieces.

Next, soak the mixture in fine, ash-free wine in a large white porcelain vessel for two nights. The wine and vessel should match the quantity of the drug. Transfer both the drug and the wine into a clean pot, and boil with strong fire for the duration of a meal. Then, reduce the flame and simmer gently, until the liquid bubbles like crab eyes. Use a willow-wood paddle, four *chǐ* long and three *fǎng* wide, to stir slowly—do not stop stirring. If tired, replace with another person. Add more fine wine as needed, until the decoction is complete. The decoction must begin at dawn and not last beyond two nights.

When the residue resembles thin glue, add the following ingredients in sequence:
- **Deer Horn (Lújiǎo)**, one *tiáo* (conditioned by roasting until yellow), made into powder, and prepared with the other drugs—
- **Betel Nut (Bīngláng)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Halonium (Tōngcǎo)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Sophora Root (Qínjiāo)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Ginseng (Rénshēn)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Licorice (Gāncǎo)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Cuscuta Seed (Túsīzǐ)**, steeped in wine for two nights, then dried and pounded separately;
- **Meat of Cordyceps (Ròuzhīróng)**, one *liǎng* (20 pieces).

If no further supplementation is needed, these ingredients need not be decocted together. Alternatively, prepare the decoction for the duration of a meal, then let it cool slightly before adding the other powdered drugs, stirring until well combined. Wait until the mixture thickens enough to form pills, then store it in a clean vessel. With many hands rolling the pills simultaneously, shape them to the size of *wúzi* (willow seeds). If not enough hands are available, roll them one by one while keeping the mixture warm, and size them like *gǔshǒu* (ox-hoof pills). Apply a slight coating of ghee to the hands as needed.

**Method of Consumption:**
Take the pills on an empty stomach with three *guǒ* (fruits) of *jiāng* (juice), or with wine if no juice is available. Begin with thirty pills daily, increasing by one each day until reaching fifty pills as the standard dose, taken twice daily.

Within the first hundred days of consumption, abstain from sexual activity. After one month of taking the pills, internal ailments will begin to dissipate, and minor bowel movements should not be cause for alarm. Gradually, excessive flatulence will cease, appetite will improve, hearing and vision will sharpen, the spirit will be fortified, the organs will be steadied, bone marrow will be nourished, the waist and limbs will regain strength, allowing one to stand for long periods. Gray hair will turn black, and a youthful appearance will return even to the aged.

For those suffering from **qi** disorders, add **Rhizoma Pinelliae (Gēnshí)** and **Lignum Aquilariae (Qīngmùxiāng)**, each one *liǎng* (20 pieces), following the previous method.

If one has previously taken **elixirs of cinnabar or minerals (dànshí)**, consume **Three-Yellow Pill (Sānhuáng Wán)** with meals to induce mild bowel movements and purge the system.

If drinking wine or eating *qū* (fermented foods) causes dry mouth, coarse nasal breath, and dull eyes, take it with honey juice to alleviate the symptoms. If the symptoms persist, add **Three-Yellow Pill (Sānhuáng Wán)** to induce mild bowel movements.

In all cases, once the **Dao/Way** has been activated, regulate the diet accordingly.

After two hundred days of consumption, facial wrinkles will smooth out and a natural glow will appear. Within a year, teeth will fall out and regrow, memory will strengthen, the body will feel as light as wind, and one may walk several hundred *lǐ* (miles) daily. By the second year, the body will naturally become plump and well-fed, with reduced hunger, and those over seventy will appear as young adults. By the third year, the intestines will solidify like sinew and marrow, and one will foresee events before they occur. By the fourth year, one will be perpetually sated, no longer needing food, and may directly encounter **Daoist Immortals (xiān rén)**.

If taken continuously by those under thirty, the complexion will remain forever youthful and unchanging.

When preparing the medicine, do so in a **pure chamber (jìngshì)**, excluding the presence of **chickens, dogs, women, filial children (xiàozǐ)**, and others. Women may also take this medicine.

**For the Treatment of Organ Deficiency and Chronic Fatigue, as well as Tightness and Heat in the Lower Abdomen:**
Apply **moxibustion (jiǔ)** to the **Kidney Shu (Shènshū)** point twenty times (or adjust according to age and constitution). If the condition is marked by **cold deficiency (xuélěng)**, apply up to a hundred times. Moxibustion should be applied horizontally across three *cùn* (inches).

**Chapter 1: Treatise on the Bladder Vessel**
**Section #1: The Bladder Vessel (Pāngguāng Fǔ) Treatise**

The **Bladder Vessel** governs the **kidneys**, with its manifestations observed in the ears. The kidneys converge their *qi* into the bladder. The bladder, as a *fǔ* (visceral organ), is the repository of bodily fluids, known as the **"Water Clerk"** (*Shuǐ Cāochuàn*) or **"Jade Sea"** (*Yùhǎi*). It weighs **nine *liǎng* and two *chǔ*** (≈252g), coiled in a leftward spiral, extending vertically, nine *cùn* in breadth, and holds **nine *shēng* and nine *hé* (≈1.125L)** of fluids, balanced on both sides, corresponding to the **twenty-four solar terms**. Its orifice opens externally at the nose, while the bladder itself is prone to leakage.

The **Yellow Emperor** asked: *"Why do the five *zàng* (solid organs) each have one name and one form, while the kidneys alone are paired?"*

**Qíbó** replied: *"The bladder, as a *fǔ*, exists in two locations, and the kidneys likewise manifest in two forms, corresponding to the bladder’s duality. Though the *zàng* are singularly named, the *fǔ* are named in pairs—hence the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*."*

An alternative view holds that the kidneys are paired, while the bladder is singular. Now, we align the **left kidney** with the bladder and the **right kidney** with the **Triple Burner**.

If the **pulse at the *guān* (wrist crease) posterior to the *zhōngyáng* (middle finger line) on the left hand is absent**, it signifies the absence of the **Bladder Vessel**. Symptoms include:
- **Cold inversion** (*niùlěng*)
- **Irregular menstruation** in women, with **cessation during the *wángyuè* (winter solstice)**
- **Semen loss** in men
- **Dribbling urine**
Treatment: **Puncture the *shǎoyīn* (foot minor yin) meridian** at the **dorsal artery below the medial malleolus** (i.e., the *shǎoyīn* channel’s *yīn* point).

If the **pulse at the *guān* posterior to the *zhōngyáng* on the right hand is absent**, it signifies the absence of the **Child’s Gate Vessel** (*Zǐhù Mài*). Symptoms include:
- **Cold inversion in the feet**
- **Infertility**
- **Leucorrhea**
- **Sterility**
- **Cold in the genital region**
Treatment: **Puncture the *shǎoyīn* meridian** to regulate the *yīn*.

If the **pulse at the *guān* posterior to the *zhōngyáng* on the left hand is full**, it indicates **Bladder fullness**. Symptoms include:
- **Cold inversion**
- **Lateral pain from pathogenic *qi* drawing inward**
Treatment: **Puncture the *tàiyáng* (foot major yang) meridian** to regulate the *yáng*, targeting the **depression posterior to the proximal joint of the little toe** (i.e., the *tàiyáng* channel’s *yáng* point).

If the **pulse at the *guān* posterior to the *zhōngyáng* on the right hand is full**, it also indicates **Bladder fullness**. Symptoms include:
- **Distension of the lower abdomen**
- **Lumbar pain radiating upward**
Treatment: **Puncture the *tàiyáng* meridian** to regulate the *yáng*.

If disease **first manifests in the bladder**, the following patterns emerge:
- **Day 5 (associated with the kidneys)**: **Lumbar and sacral pain**, **urinary retention**, **acidic meridian sensations** in the lower abdomen and spine.
- **Day 1 (associated with the small intestine)**: **Abdominal distension**.
- **Day 1 (associated with the spleen)**: **Obstruction and stagnation**, **body heaviness and pain**.

If the condition persists for **two days**, death follows—**winter’s parrot-like cry**, **summer’s drooling**. *(Alternative: "at dusk.")*

For **Bladder disease**:
- **Unilateral distension and pain** in the lower abdomen, such that pressing it with the hand **triggers the urge to urinate without release**,
- **Heat in the shoulders**,
- If the **pulse is sunken**, **heat** also manifests at the **lateral side of the little toe** and **posterior to the ankle** on the *tàiyáng* channel.
  **Treatment**: **Needle *Wěizhōng*** (CV4).

For **Bladder distension**:
- **Fullness in the lower abdomen** with **difficult urination** (*qì liáo*).

When **disease first strikes the kidneys** and **transmits to the Bladder**:
- **Persistent kidney cough** leads to **involuntary urination** upon coughing.
- If **ulterior *jué* qi** lodges in the Bladder, **nocturnal somnambulism** ensues.

The **kidneys govern bone**; thus:
- **Dense, thick skin** indicates **thick *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**;
- **Coarse, thin skin** indicates **thin *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**;
- **Loose texture, sparse hair** indicates **lax *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**;
- **Taut skin with no hair** indicates **constricted *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**;
- **Coarse, lustrous hair** indicates **straight *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**;
- **Sparse hair** indicates **knotted *Sānjiāo* and Bladder**.

**Biānqué** said:
*"When the six *fǔ* are diseased, the face reflects it.
The **kidneys and Bladder**, along with the *shǎoyīn* and *tàiyáng* channels, form the **external enclosure**.
Since the **Bladder communicates with the five *zàng***, when the *zàng* are afflicted, the Bladder responds;
when the Bladder is afflicted, the **uterus (*bāo náng*)** responds.

**Heat injury** causes **urinary obstruction**, **Bladder urgency**, and **bitter, yellow-red urine**.
**Cold injury** causes **frequent, clear urination**, or **urinary stones**—
its root lies in the Bladder, with **small limbs** and **a disproportionately large abdomen**.
*(Treatment) **referenced in the *Water Treatment* chapter**.*

**Severed bone** is untreatable;
**yellow, falling teeth** portend death in **ten days.**

The **Foot Tàiyáng** channel originates at the inner canthus of the eye, ascends the forehead, and converges at the crown. Its branch extends from the crown to the upper angle of the ear. Its direct course descends from the crown, enters to network the brain, then emerges to descend behind the neck, follows the inner aspect of the shoulder and scapula, runs along the spine to the lumbar region, enters to network the kidneys, and connects with the Bladder.

Its branch descends from the lumbar region to meet at the perineum, then passes through the buttocks and enters the coccygeal region. Another branch descends from the inner scapula, bifurcates to pierce the hip (or *kuān*), passes the sacral pivot (*pí shū*), follows the posterior lateral aspect of the thigh, converges at the popliteal fossa, then descends to pierce the inner malleolus, emerges behind the lateral malleolus, follows the cuboid bone, and terminates at the lateral side of the little toe.

When this channel is disturbed, it causes **frontal headache**, the sensation of the eyes protruding, the neck feeling as if pulled taut, spinal pain, lumbar rigidity as if broken, inability to flex the hip, the popliteal fossa feeling knotted, and the heel as if split—this is known as **ankle reversal (*huái jié*)**. It governs diseases of the **sinews**, including hemorrhoids, malaria, mania, epilepsy, and convulsions; headaches, brain and neck pain; jaundiced eyes, excessive tearing, nasal and epistaxis bleeding; pain in the neck, back, lumbar region, popliteal fossa, heels, and feet; and dysfunction of the little toe. When excessive, the *rén yīng* pulse at the wrist is twice as large as the *cùn kǒu* pulse; when deficient, the *rén yīng* pulse is smaller than the *cùn kǒu* pulse.

**General Treatment for Bladder Disorders:**
Moxibustion as per the method for Kidney Deficiency.

**Discourse on the Bladder Sacculus (Bāonáng Lùn):**
The bladder sacculus is the diagnostic region of the kidneys and bladder, storing *jīnyè* (津液) and urine. If there is heat in the zàng (腑), the sacculus becomes constricted, obstructing urination, with yellowish urine. If there is cold in the fǔ (腑), the sacculus becomes slippery, with frequent urination and white discharge. If urination is particularly frequent at night, it is due to the rise of *yīnyáng* (陰陽) *qi* at night.

Thus, heat is treated by purgation, cold by tonification, and when neither heat nor cold is present, regulation follows the *jing* (經). Then, the disease will not arise.

If urine does not reside in the sacculus, it is due to its contraction or deviation, obstructing *jīnyè*. Use leek leaves, remove the tip, and insert into the urethra to a depth of 3 *cùn*, gently blowing with the mouth. When the sacculus expands and *jīnyè* flows freely, the condition will be cured.

**Chapter Four: Treatise on the Three *Jiao* (Triple Burners)**

The Three *Jiao* are also called the Three Passes. The Upper *Jiao* is named *Sān Guǎn* (Three Passages) and *Fǎnshè* (Reflection), the Middle *Jiao* is named *Huòluàn* (Churning), and the Lower *Jiao* is named *Zǒubǔ* (Nursing). Together, they form an entity with a name but no tangible form. They govern the five *zàng* (solid organs) and six *fǔ* (hollow organs), serving as the divine pathways through which *qi* circulates, permeating the entire body—visible in its effects but not in its substance. They harmonize and facilitate the flow of refined *qi*, regulate the waterways, and restrain *qi* between the intestines and stomach. Their functions must not be overlooked.

The Three *Jiao* are also called the *Zhōngqīng* (Middle Clarity) *fǔ* (hollow organ), with the alternate name *Yùhǎi* (Jade Sea). The waterways emerge from here and converge with the bladder, though they remain distinct. The Upper, Middle, and Lower *Jiao* are collectively referred to as the *Gūfǔ* (Orphan Hollow Organ), with *yíng* (nutritive *qi*) emanating from the Middle *Jiao* and *wèi* (defensive *qi*) from the Upper *Jiao*.

*Nutritive qi* (*yíng*) is the pathway of the *luò* (collateral vessels), while *defensive qi* (*wèi*) is the pathway of the *jīng* (main channels). The Three *Jiao* vary in thickness, size, and form, yet share the same structure as the bladder.

**Diseases of the Three *Jiao*:**
When the Three *Jiao* are diseased, the abdomen becomes distended with *qi*, and the lower abdomen is particularly firm, preventing urination. Urgency and straining occur, with retention leading to distension and overflow resulting in urinary discharge. Observe the large collateral on the lateral side of the foot’s *Dàyáng* (Greater Yang) channel, located between the *Tàiyáng* (Greater Yang) and *Shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang) channels, also visible in the pulse. Treat at *Wěiyáng* (Bend Sun).

If the lower abdomen is swollen and painful with urinary retention, the pathology lies in the Three *Jiao*. Restrict treatment to the large collateral of the *Tàiyáng* channel. If the pulse is knotted at the junction of the *Juéyīn* (Supreme Yin) small collateral and blood is present, the swelling extends upward to the stomach tube—treat at *Sān Lǐ* (Three Miles).

When the Three *Jiao* are distended, *qi* fills the skin, causing a taut, non-painful sensation—some texts describe it as taut and firm. Chronic, unremitting coughing may spread to the Three *Jiao*, resulting in abdominal fullness and loss of appetite.

The channel of the hand’s *Shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang) begins at the lateral side of the second toe, ascends between the two toes, follows the outer wrist, passes between the two bones of the forearm, pierces the elbow, travels along the outer upper arm to the shoulder, and emerges behind the foot’s *Shàoyáng* channel, entering the *Quēpén* (Notched Basin) and intersecting *Tánzhōng* (Chest Center). It disperses into the collateral network of the pericardium, descends through the diaphragm, and spreads throughout the Three *Jiao*.

A branch ascends from *Tánzhōng* to the *Quēpén*, then to the nape, alongside the ear’s posterior, curving upward to the ear’s upper angle, and bending downward to the [missing character]. Another branch enters the ear from behind, emerges in front, passes the *Kèzhǔrén* (Guest and Host) points, crosses the cheek, and reaches the outer canthus of the eye.

When this channel is disturbed, it causes deafness with a ringing or buzzing sensation, throat swelling, and pharyngeal obstruction. The diseases it governs—induced by *qi* imbalance—include spontaneous sweating, pain at the outer canthus, swollen cheeks, and pain behind the ear, on the shoulder, upper arm, elbow, and outer forearm. The second toe and adjacent toe may also become dysfunctional.

For these conditions, apply reduction if excessive, tonification if deficient, rapid moxibustion if there is heat, and prolonged moxibustion if there is cold. If the pulse is sunken, use moxibustion. For neither excess nor deficiency, treat according to the channel. An excessive pulse at *Rényīng* (Human Welcome) is twice as strong as at *Cùnkǒu* (Cun Opening), while a deficient pulse is weaker at *Rényīng* than at *Cùnkǒu*.

---
**Chapter Five: The Vacancies and Plenitudes of the Three *Jiao* – Moxibustion Methods**

The Upper *Jiao* resembles mist rising upward—its *qi* originates from the upper orifice of the stomach (or mouth, as per *Nánjīng*, *Jiǎyǔ*, and *Cháoyuán*), passing through the throat and diaphragm, spreading across the chest, moving to the armpit, and following the division of the foot’s *Tàiyīn* (Greater Yin) channel. It returns to the hand’s *Yángmíng* (Yang Brightness) channel, ascending to the tongue and descending to the foot’s *Yángmíng* channel. It circulates with *yíng* and *wèi* *qi* for twenty-five degrees along the Yang pathways and twenty-five degrees along the Yin pathways, completing one full cycle every day and night—fifty cycles in total—before reuniting at the hand’s *Tàiyīn* channel.

It governs diseases of the hand’s *Shàoyáng* and the heart and lungs. When *qi* is internally trapped, heat in the body causes drinking and eating to descend into the stomach, but the *qi* is unsettled. Sweating ensues—sometimes on the face, sometimes on the back—with generalized body heat. Why does sweat emerge without following the *wèi* *qi*’s usual pathways? External wind invasion opens the pores, causing *wèi* *qi* to disperse and fail to follow its proper course. This *qi* is fierce, slippery, and swift; it escapes through any opening, hence the name *Lòuqì* (Leaky *Qi*).

The resulting ailments include elbow contracture and pain, vomiting before defecation (due to disrupted *qi* flow), and a sense of oppression in the diaphragm. This explains why vomiting precedes defecation. Cold induces spiritual disarray, leading to diarrhea, dysentery, and aphonia. If excessive, the condition ascends to the heart; if deficient, it draws *qi* into the lungs.

**Ze Xie Tang (Alisma Decoction) – Opens the Channels and Drains Heat**

**The eleven herbs above**, □-caul, use **two *dòu* of water**, decoct to obtain **five *shēng***, and divide into **five doses**.

**Discourse on the Middle Jiao**:
The **Middle Jiao** is like **a stagnant pool** (*yòuyòu*), within the stomach as if **a pool were stagnating**. Its *qi* arises from the **stomach’s central pathway**—*Nánjīng* renders it as **Middle Mouth**, while *Jiǎyǐ* and *Cháoyuán* render it as **Stomach Mouth**—located **after the Upper Jiao**.

This is the **receptor of *qi*** (*Shòuqì*), responsible for **transforming water and grain into flavors**, **concealing糟粕 (*zāozāo* – dregs and impurities)**, **steaming essences and fluids**, and **refining them into vital subtleties** (*jīngwēi*), which **ascend to the lung’s channels** (*Fèimài*) and are then **converted into blood**. This blood **nourishes the body** (*shēngshēn*), and none is more precious than this. Thus, it **alone circulates through the meridians and collateral vessels**, known as **Nourishing *Qi*** (*Róngqì*), governing **Foot Yang Ming**.

The **alternate name of Foot Yang Ming** is **Feng Long** (*Fēnglóng*), located **eight *cùn* above the ankle** (*wàiguì*), **separating to course along Foot Tai Yin**, and **connecting with the pulses of all meridians**. It **ascends and descends to link with the Great Granary** (*Tàicāng*), governing **the fermentation and maturation of the five grains**—**neither vomiting nor descending occurs**.

If **excessive**, it **generates heat**; if **heat is present**, it **becomes obstructed and fails to pass through**, leading to **disconnection between upper and lower**.

If **deficient**, it **produces cold**; if **cold is present**, it causes **abdominal pain**, **leakage**, **diarrhea**, and **cholera-like disorders**, governing **spleen and stomach diseases**.

Now, **blood and *qi*** differ in form yet share the same essence (*lèi*). The **Defensive *Qi*** (*Wèiqì*) is the **vital essence** (*jīng*), and the **Nutritive *Qi*** (*Xuéqì*) is the **spirit** (*shén*). Thus, blood and *qi* share the same essence though they bear different names.

Where **blood is lost**, there is **no sweat**—this is the **spirit-*qi** (*shénqì*).
Where **sweat is depleted**, there is **no blood**—this is the **essence-*qi** (*jīngqì*).

Thus, **a person may have two deaths** (*liǎngsǐ*) but **no two lives** (*èrshēng*), akin to the **disconnection of spirit-*qi**.

If **deficient**, **supplement the stomach**; if **excessive**, **drain the spleen**. **Regulate the central harmony** and **balance the source**, and **not one among ten thousand will be neglected**.

**Shu Da Huang (Rhubarb) Drains Heat Decoction** – **Opens the Blocked Channels** and **Connects the Isolated**, treating **Middle Jiao excess-heat obstruction**, where **upper and lower fail to communicate**, **channels are blocked and disconnected**, **neither vomiting nor descending occurs**, **abdominal fullness and distension** (*Péngjiāo*), and **rapid, labored breathing**:
- Shu Da Huang (Rhubarb) – **cut**, soaked in **one *shēng* of water**
- Scutellaria Root (*Huángqín*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Alisma (*Zéxiè*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Cimicifuga Rhizome (*Shēngmá*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Mirabilite (*Mángxiāo*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Antelope Horn (*Língyángjiǎo*) – 4 *liǎng*
- Gardenia Fruit (*Zhīzǐ*) – 4 *liǎng*
- Fresh Scrophularia (*ShēngXuánshēn*) – 8 *liǎng*
- Rehmannia Juice (*Dìhuángzhī*) – 1 *shēng*
**The nine herbs above**, □-caul, use **seven *shēng* of water**, decoct to obtain **two *shēng* and three *gě***, then add the **pre-soaked rhubarb**, boil again for **two more cycles** (*liǎngfèi*), remove the dregs, add **mirabilite**, and divide into **three doses**.

**Lan Qing (Isatis) Pill** – Treats **Middle Jiao heat** with **watery or grain-induced diarrhea**:
- Isatis Juice (*Lánqīngzhī*) – 3 *shēng*
- Huang Lian (Coptis) – 8 *liǎng*
- Phellodendron Bark (*Huángbò*) – 4 *liǎng*
- Mume Flesh (*Wūméiròu*) – 2 *liǎng*
- Earthworm (*Dìfūzǐ*) – 2 *liǎng*
- Gardenia Fruit (*Dìyǔ*) – 2 *liǎng*
- Atractylodes Macrocephala (*Báizhú*) – 2 *liǎng*
- Donkey-Hide Gelatin (*Ājiāo*) – 5 *liǎng*
**The eight herbs above**, pulverized, mixed with **Isatis juice**, simmered over **gentle fire** (*wēihuǒ*).

Form into **pills the size of apricot kernels**; take **three pills** with water, **twice daily**. **On the seventh day of the seventh month**, combine all ingredients for a **greater efficacy**—this should be **made into a unified pill**.

**Huang Lian (Coptis) Decoction** – Treats **Middle Jiao cold**, **leakage**, and **diarrhea**, or **after cholera**, where **yellow-white discharges are uncontrollable** and **abdominal pain persists from deficiency**:
- Huang Lian (Coptis) – 4 *liǎng*
- Pomegranate Peel (*Suānshíliúpí*) – 4 *liǎng*
- Gardenia Fruit (*Dìyǔ*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Donkey-Hide Gelatin (*Ājiāo*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Phellodendron Bark (*Huángbò*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Angelica Root (*Dāngguī*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Magnolia Bark (*Hòupò*) – 3 *liǎng*
- Dried Ginger (*Gāojiāng*) – 3 *liǎng*
**The eight herbs above**, □-caul, use **nine *shēng* of water**; decoct to obtain **three *shēng***, remove dregs, add **donkey-hide gelatin**, and simmer again until dissolved (*yōng*), then divide into **three doses**.

Treats **four limbs being unable to lift or move**, with **excessive sweating** and **leakage-diarrhea**.

**For the following acupuncture treatment**: Moxa the **Great Horizontal (Dàhéng) Point** according to the patient’s age and constitution; the point is located **two inches and five *fēn* away from the navel on either side**.

**Discourse on the Lower Jiao**:
The **Lower Jiao** is like **a draining ditch** (*dúdú*), akin to **water flowing down a channel** (*yōngxiāo*), its *qi* arising from the **stomach’s lower pathway**, **separating to encircle the intestines**, and **descending into the bladder** (*Pángguāng*) to **percolate and drain**.

Thus, **water and grain** are always **conjointly stored in the stomach**, becoming **dregs and impurities** (*zāozāo*) and **together descending into the large intestine**.

It governs **Foot Tai Yang**, which **percolates and drains fluids**, **unites with the bladder**, **controls excretion but not intake**, and **discriminates between clear and turbid** (*Bìngqīngzhuó*), governing **the symptoms of liver and kidney diseases**.

**Discourse on the Lower Jiao’s Pathologies and Treatments:**

If **replete**, then **defecation and urination are obstructed**, *qi* **reverses and falters**, and **vomiting cannot be restrained**—thus it is called **"rushing suckling"** (*zǒubǔ*). If **vacant**, then **defecation and urination are uncontrollable**, and **fluids and *qi* are exhausted**.

When **a person drinks wine into the stomach**, yet **the grain is undigested while urine descends first**, why is this? Wine is the **refined essence of mature grain**, its *qi* **bold and slippery**, thus **later entering but earlier exiting**.

Hence, **heat drains into the liver**, while **cold and murkiness supplement the kidneys**.

**Prescriptions for the Bladder Viscera**

**#1: Cholera (6th) – Theory, Symptoms, Prescriptions, and Moxibustion Method**

The Master says: *"Cholera, as a disease, arises solely from improper diet and has nothing to do with malevolent spirits. When one overeats rich meats and cold dairy, consumes an excess of seafood and land-based delicacies without restraint, sleeps on cold mats, and drinks chilled liquids, the stomach’s food stagnates and fails to digest. The interplay of yin and yang qi becomes disrupted—yang strives to ascend while yin seeks to descend, their disharmony giving rise to vomiting and dysentery. The patient suffers a splitting headache, joint dislocations, and convulsions throughout the limbs. Though the symptoms may seem minor at first, the disease’s progression is most perilous—even standing at the edge of a precipice cannot fully convey its danger. Those who cultivate life must grasp this truth to avoid untimely death.*

*In treating cholera, warmth and moderation are paramount. Exposure to cold will provoke convulsions throughout the body. Ideally, the patient should abstain from food for one day, then gradually reintroduce small portions of congee over three days. Only after this period may they resume normal eating, but for seven days, they should avoid mixed dishes to nourish the spleen’s qi.*

*Most cases of cholera stem from overindulgence in cold meats, dairy, or excessive, unregulated eating, followed by improper rest—such as sleeping without adequate covering. Many perish from this neglect.*

*The foundation of life lies in the five viscera, which correspond to the five phases (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water). Internally, they govern the five flavors; externally, they interact with them. Thus, seasonal adjustments in diet are essential. The *Classics* warn: ‘In spring, avoid excessive pungency; in summer, avoid saltiness; in late summer, avoid sourness; in autumn, avoid bitterness; in winter, avoid sweetness.’ These restrictions are not absolute prohibitions but cautions against excess. The proverb states, ‘A hundred diseases originate from the mouth’—a truth not without merit.*

*During the summer solstice to autumnal equinox, one must avoid greasy, rich foods. Yet in hot months, people naturally crave cold foods, compounding the harm by pairing them with heavy meals, unchecked consumption of fruits and vegetables, and excessive exposure to cold through sleep and bathing. Such imbalances in the five flavors inevitably lead to illness—even those who wish to remain healthy cannot escape it. As the *Book of Changes* states: ‘It is not Heaven that cuts short life; it is the person who brings ruin upon themselves.’*

*In cholera, rice water is strictly forbidden, as its ingestion provokes unrelenting vomiting. Instead, administer a decoction of *Houpu* (magnolia bark) and *Gegen* (kudzu root). Winter melon leaf tea may be sipped lightly to moisten the throat but must not be overconsumed. If vomiting persists during decoction intake, discontinue once the episode ceases.*

*If the pulse is imperceptible, prescribe a decoction of *Guizhi* (cinnamon twig) and *Gegen*. For persistent vomiting and diarrhea with restlessness, feverish flesh, and absent sweating—without convulsions and with a rapid, tense pulse—administer a decoction of *Xijiao* (rhinoceros horn) and *Gegen*.

*For unremitting vomiting and diarrhea with fever, restlessness, and thirst, offer small amounts of rice flour gruel. If symptoms persist, prescribe a decoction of *Gegen*, *Jie* (chickweed), and *Fu* (smilax).

*A student inquired: ‘What constitutes cholera?’ The Master replied: ‘Repeated vomiting and diarrhea.’*

*A student asked further: ‘A patient presents with fever, headache, body aches, aversion to cold, followed by vomiting and diarrhea—what ailment is this?’ The Master answered: ‘This is cholera. Cholera is characterized by alternating episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, interspersed with fever.’*

*If the pulse is faint and rough—indicating an underlying cholera—yet the patient exhibits signs of *Shanghan* (cold-induced febrile disease) and progresses to the yin channels within four or five days, convulsions and diarrhea will inevitably follow. Once diarrhea reverses to a downward flow, the condition is untreatable.*

*In cholera, excessive vomiting leads to convulsions without thirst, accompanied by umbilical distension. If the umbilicus distends in cholera, it signifies disturbed kidney qi, and *Zhongzi Tang* (Central Seed Decoction) must be administered first—omitting *Fuzi* (processed aconite) but adding *Guizhi* (cinnamon twig). The omission of Wood (aconite) is due to its depleting nature; cinnamon is added to prevent *Beitun* (abdominal distension with inability to lie flat).*

*For cholera with umbilical distension, excessive vomiting, or excessive diarrhea; for cholera with palpitations, thirst, or abdominal pain; for vomiting with diarrhea, or vomiting with diarrhea and a craving for water—all are treated with *Zhongzi Tang*.*

**Zhongzi Tang** – *For cholera with vomiting, diarrhea, distension, indigestion, and abdominal pain:*
- Ginseng (*Rénshēn*) – 3 *liang*
- Dried Ginger (*Gānjiāng*) – 3 *liang*
- White Atractylodes (*Báizhú*) – 3 *liang*
- Licorice (*Gāncǎo*) – 3 *liang*

*Decoct the four ingredients with 8 *sheng* of water, reducing to 3 *sheng*, and divide into three doses. If symptoms persist, administer three additional doses.*

*For preventive use during travel, prepare the decoction into pills the size of *wúzi* (schisandra berries), taking 30 pills. Alternatively, as a powder, take one *fangchén* dose with wine.*

*If convulsions occur, add 3 *liang* of gypsum.*

*Zhang Zhongjing states: ‘If the umbilicus distends, kidney qi is disturbed. Remove *Fuzi* and add 4 *liang* of *Guizhi*.’ For excessive vomiting, remove *Fuzi* and add 3 *liang* of fresh ginger. For excessive diarrhea, reintroduce *Fuzi*. For palpitations, add 2 *liang* of *Fuling* (poria). For thirst with a desire for water, add 4.5 *liang* of *Fuzi* combined with the original ingredients. For abdominal pain, add 4.5 *liang* of ginseng combined with the original ingredients. For coldness, add 4.5 *liang* of dried ginger combined with the original ingredients. For abdominal distension, remove *Fuzi* and add one piece of *Fuzi* (processed aconite).*

*After ingesting the decoction, consume a bowl of warm congee within an hour, ensuring the patient remains lightly covered and avoids sudden exposure to cold.*

**Guizhi Tang** – *For cholera with ceased vomiting and diarrhea but persistent body aches, this decoction gently harmonizes the exterior. The formula appears in the *Shanghan Lun* (Treatise on Cold-Induced Febrile Diseases).*

**Sisuo Tang** – *For cholera with convulsions, cold limbs, sweating, and hiccups:*

**Four-Inverse Decoction (Sì Nì Tāng)** – *For extreme cold with cold hands and feet, and a vanishing pulse:*
**Aconite (processed)** – 2 *liang*
**Ginseng** – 3 *liang*
**Dried ginger** – 3 *liang*
**Licorice** – 3 *liang*
**Right four herbs**, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 6 *sheng* of water, reduce to 2 *sheng*, and divide into three doses.
*The Range Wang [commentary] states:* For severe diarrhea, add 2 *liang* of dragon bone.

---

**Great Four-Inverse Decoction (Dà Sì Nì Tāng)** – *For vomiting and diarrhea ceased, with sweating and reversal (ulceration), or clear-water diarrhea, where the body feels cold while the exterior is hot, the pulse is faint and nearly vanishing, or where there is fever and aversion to cold, with stiff limbs and cold extremities:*
**Licorice** – 2 *liang*
**Dried ginger** – 1.5 *liang*
**Aconite (processed)** – 1 piece
*Right three herbs*, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 3 *sheng* of water, reduce to 1.2 *sheng*, and serve warm in two divided doses. For stronger cases, use 1 piece of **great aconite** and up to 3 *liang* of dried ginger.
*The Guang Ji Fang [Compendium of Aid and Relief] states:* If, after vomiting, the patient gasps with shallow breathing, or if the abdomen is distended after purging, add 1 *liang* of ginseng.

---

**Unblocking Pulse Four-Inverse Decoction (Tōng Mài Sì Nì Tāng)** – *For cholera with ceased vomiting and diarrhea, sweating, and reversal, where limbs remain stiff and the pulse is faint and nearly vanishing:*
**Great aconite (processed)** – 1 piece
**Licorice** – 1.5 *liang*
**Dried ginger** – 3 *liang* (4 *liang* for stronger cases)
*Right three herbs*, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 3 *sheng* of water, reduce to 1.2 *sheng*, and divide into two doses. Recovery follows as the pulse returns.
- If the face is flushed, add 9 stalks of **scallion**.
- For abdominal pain, remove scallion and add 2 *liang* of **peony**.
- For retching, add 3 *liang* of **fresh ginger**.
- For sore throat, remove peony and add 1 *liang* of **trichosanthes fruit**.
- If diarrhea ceases but the pulse does not return, remove trichosanthes and add 2 *liang* of ginseng.
*All modifications must align with the original formula before administration.*
*Zhongjing [Zhang Zhongjing] used this decoction with added pig bile.*

---

**Bamboo Leaf Decoction (Zhú Yè Tāng)** – *For cholera with vomiting and diarrhea that persists after administering Lì Zhōng and Sì Shùn decoctions, where heat remains unresolved:*
**Bamboo leaves** – 1 handful
**Small millet** – 1 *sheng*
**Fresh ginger** – 10 slices
**Licorice, ginseng, aconite (processed), peony, tangerine peel, angelica, cinnamon twig** – each 1 *liang*
**White atractylodes** – 3 *liang*
*Right eleven herbs*, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 1.5 *dou* of water, first boiling the bamboo leaves and millet to 8 *sheng*, then adding the remaining herbs to reduce to 3 *sheng*, divided into three doses.
- For upward counterflow (*shàngqì*), add 0.5 *sheng* of **evodia**, ensuring resolution.

*Both Lì Zhōng and Sì Shùn decoctions are strongly warming; if heat is present, bamboo leaf decoction is appropriate.*

**General Treatment for Cholera:**

**Treatment for Cholera with Stagnant Food and Cold Accumulation, Ghostly *Qi* Distress, and Abdominal Fullness:**
*Flattened broad bean* and *common mugwort* each 1 *sheng*.
*Right two herbs*, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 6 *sheng* of water, reduce to 2 *sheng*, and take in divided doses. May also be used alone.

**Treatment for Cholera with Persistent Diarrhea:**
*Right* use 1 handful of *mugwort*, decoct with 3 *sheng* of water, reduce to 1 *sheng*, and take all at once. Excellent.

**Another Method:**
Use 1 handful of *sweet flag*, decoct with 4 *sheng* of water, reduce to 1 *sheng*, and take all at once. *Green wood aromatic* is also good.

**Treatment for Cholera with Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Abdominal Pain:**
*Right* decoct *peach leaves* into juice, take 1 *sheng* at once, and pain will cease. In winter, use the *peach bark*.

**Treatment for Cholera with Induced Vomiting, Where Vomiting Occurs Immediately After Drinking:**
*Right* use fresh ginger 5 *liang*, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 5 *sheng* of water, reduce to 2.5 *sheng*, and divide into two doses. *Galangal* is even better.

**Preventive Treatment for Cholera Before Long Journeys:**
*Duckweed*, *sweet flag*, *white atractylodes*, *tangerine peel*, *Evodia rutaecarpa*, *dried ginger*, *ginseng*, *thick-skinned magnolia bark*, *aucklandia costus*, *chicken tongue spikenard*, *dianthus superbus*, *cinnamon twig*, *thin mint*, *female Artemisia*, and *fennel* – *right* fifteen herbs, equally divided, ground into powder, formed into honey pills the size of *Chinese date seeds*.

Take twenty pills with wine, three times daily.

During the *Wu De* era, there was a virtuous nun named *Pure Clarity* who had suffered from this ailment for a long time. Sometimes it flared once a month, sometimes twice. Each flare brought her near death. Even the *Chao Tai* physicians of the time, including those of the *Jiang Xu Gan Chao* school, could not recognize it. I treated her as cholera and administered this formula, and she recovered. Thus, I record it here.

**Treatment for Cholera Following Stone Consumption, Where Vomiting and Diarrhea Cease but Symptoms Persist:**
If one has first consumed *stone medicine* and then cholera induces vomiting and diarrhea, which stops after taking various hot drugs, but then transforms into *emptiness* (虚), restlessness, hot palms and soles, dry mouth, thirst, retching, confusion, and rapid, tense pulse – or if, after a febrile illness, residual *heat poison* remains and cholera again causes vomiting and diarrhea, followed by heat in the chest and heart as if tearing apart – use this to resolve it:

*Radicchio*, *ginseng*, *thick-skinned magnolia bark*, *anemarrhena asphodeloides*, *trichosanthes root*, *poria*, *rhinoceros horn*, *indigo naturalis*, *green tangerine fruit*, *platycodon grandiflorum*, *tangerine peel*, *pueraria root*, *scutellaria baicalensis*, and *licorice* – each 2 *liang*.
*Right* fourteen herbs, coarsely chopped. Decoct with 1 *dou* of water, reduce to 3 *sheng*, and divide into three doses.

**Treatment for Cholera with Internal Heat, Sudden Profuse Sweating, Restlessness, Rapid Pulse, and Desire for Cold Water:**
*Right* drink 1 *sheng* of freshly drawn well water at once, and it will cure immediately. Do not use this if one has previously suffered from *stomach coldness*.

**Secret Remedy for Cholera That Conventional Treatments Cannot Cure:**
*Right* use the menstrual cloth and blood of a virgin, burn to ash, make into powder, and take 1 *fen* (方寸匕) with wine. Use this if all other remedies fail.

**Treatment for Cholera with Spasmodic Twitching:**
*Right* use 1 handful of *knotweed*, remove both ends, decoct with 2 *sheng* of water, reduce to 1 *sheng*, and take all at once. Another method: decoct *pear leaves* instead.

**Another Method:**
Burn the ash of an old wooden comb, make into powder, and take with wine, 1 small dose. This will permanently cure it.

**Another Method:**
Apply the grease from the center of a *cart wheel hub* to the soles of the feet. This will cure it.

**Treatment for Cholera with Spasmodic Twitching Entering the Abdomen, Where All Else Fails:**
Prepare extremely salty brine, warm and soak the feet in a trough. Another method:

**Treatment for Persistent Spasms:**
If treating with fermented green cloth poultices, replace when cooled.

**For Unrelenting Spasms:**
If a man, pull his *yin* (阴) and stretch it; if a woman, pull near her breasts on either side.

**Moxibustion Methods (灸法):**
It is said: For cholera, though moxibustion may not cure it immediately, it will prevent death. Do not apply moxa prematurely. Some cases begin with abdominal pain, others with diarrhea followed by vomiting—treat according to symptoms.

If pain begins in the chest or vomiting first occurs, moxibustion at *Jiuque* (巨阙) seven times (one *zhàng*—壮—per application), located one *cun* below the heart. If ineffective, repeat as before.

If abdominal pain begins first, moxibustion at *Taicang* (太仓) twenty-one times (三七壮), located four *cun* below *Xinyan* (心厌) and one *cun* above the navel. If unresolved, repeat as before.

If vomiting and diarrhea are uncontrollable and both *yin* and *yang* pulses are rapid, moxibustion at *Xinbi* (心蔽骨) three *cun* below and at the navel three *cun* below, each forty-two to seventy times (六七十壮).

If dry retching occurs, moxibustion at *Jianshi* (间使) seven times, located three *cun* behind the wrist between two tendons. If unresolved, repeat as before.

If vomiting with phlegm occurs, moxibustion at *Xinzhu* (心主) seven times, located on the wrist crease. If vomiting persists, repeat as before.

If limbs are cold, moxibustion at *Sanyinjiao* (三阴交) seven times, located three *cun* above the medial malleolus at the *lián* bone (廉骨). If unresolved, repeat as before.

If diarrhea begins first, moxibustion at *Gumen* (谷门) fourteen times (二七壮), located two *cun* beside the navel—left for men, right for women—also called *Dachangmu* (大肠募). If unresolved, repeat as before.

If diarrhea persists, moxibustion at *Dadu* (大都) seven times, located at the inner side of the big toe’s base joint.

If dysentery is severe and the patient is near death, moxibustion at *Ciyun* (慈宫) fourteen times (二七壮), located two and a half *cun* beside the *henggu* (横骨)—the transverse bone below the navel.

If spasms occur in the arms or chest, moxibustion at the palm’s white flesh seven times, and also at *Dan Zhong* (亶中), *Zhongfu* (中府), *Jiuque* (巨阙), *Weiguan* (胃管), and *Chize* (尺泽)—all effective for muscle contractions, curing headaches and foot ailments alike.

For *walking-spasm* (走哺转筋), moxibustion at the heel’s white flesh three times seven, and at the lower abdomen’s central *henggu* (横骨) according to age.

For *fourfold spasms* (转筋四厥), moxibustion at the black-white junction of both breast roots, one *zhàng* each.

For spasms, moxibustion at *Yongquan* (涌泉) forty-two to seventy times (六七壮), located beneath the big toe’s large tendon, and once at the center of the big toe’s underside.

For unrelenting spasms, moxibustion at the heel’s tendon junction seven times—immediate cure.

If spasms enter the abdomen and pain is excruciating, four people hold the limbs while moxibustion is applied one *cun* above the navel fourteen times (十四壮). If the patient moves, stop holding.

Also, moxibustion at the *dàjīn* (大筋) of the thigh, one *cun* from the *yin* (阴).

For cholera spasms, have the patient lie face-up, arms extended. Measure the elbows with a cord, then mark points one and a half *cun* beside the spine at the cord’s level—moxibustion one hundred times (一百壮) ensures cure. *Zhǒuhòu* (《肘后》) states: This is Hua Tuo’s method.

If cholera patients appear dead but retain warmth, moxibustion at *Chengjin* (承筋) seven times: measure the foot’s circumference from toe to heel with a cord, fold it in half to find the midpoint—this is the point. Also, moxibustion at the navel’s center fourteen times (二七壮).

**Supplementary Prescriptions (杂补第七论):**

It is said: Pengzu (彭祖) declared that to maintain youthful vigor, prevent exhaustion from *fángshì* (房室—sexual activity), and preserve vitality and complexion, nothing surpasses *míjiǎo* (麋角—deer antler).

**Method:**
Scrape into powder (十两), mix with one fresh *fúzi* (附子—aconite), and take one *fāngcùn* (方寸匕) with wine, thrice daily—highly effective. Alternatively, parch the powder until slightly yellow and take alone, though less potent than with *fúzi*. Even better, mix with *quèdàn* (雀卵—sparrow eggs) into pills; twenty days of use yields great results.

**Húpò Sǎn (琥珀散):**
For *xūláo* (虚劳—debilitating exhaustion), impotence, seminal emission, weakness, urinary dysfunction resembling *lín* (淋—dysuria), cold-induced frontal headaches, *qi* congestion at *guānyuán* (关元), forced sexual activity, diminished semen, lumbar pain, heavy limbs, dry throat, loss of appetite, fatigue, blurred vision, palpitations, and *wǔzàng* (五脏) exhaustion—

Grind all thirty ingredients through a sieve, mix into a paste, and store in a leather pouch. Take one *fāngcùn* before meals, thrice daily and once at night, decocted in cow or sheep milk until thick.

**Effects:**
Prolonged use strengthens vitality, lightens the body, augments *qi*, improves digestion, endures cold and heat, eliminates ailments, and—even with ten partners—prevents exhaustion. Semen becomes dense like fat; after seventy days, sexual function is restored. Long-term use reverses aging, turns white hair black, and regrows fallen teeth.

**Prescriptions from the *Thousand-Gold Canon* (太平部) – *Sun’s Emergency Formulas* (孙真人备急千金要方), Volume 63**

*Song Dynasty* **Ling Bì et al.** (林亿等) revised under **Lǎng Shǒu** (奉郎), **Guard of the Tai-Chang Office** (守太常少卿), and **Supervisor of the Secret Hall** (充秘一阁校理).

**#1 Prescriptions for *Xiao-Ke* (消渴, Diabetes)** – **First Discourse on *Xiao-Ke* (消渴第一论)**

**Prescriptions: Cauterization Method (灸法)**
The discourse states: *"In all cases where one has long indulged in alcohol, there is none who does not fall into *Xiao-Ke*. Yet, even in the depths of winter, when the sea congeals with cold, alcohol remains unfrozen—this demonstrates its nature of extreme heat, unmatched by any other substance. Salty meats and pickled delicacies are flavors alcoholics crave; without them, they cannot partake. After three cups, they lose control over their intake, consuming without measure. They chew fermented fish and sauces indiscriminately, whether sour or salty, year after year, night after night, their intoxication never ceasing. Thus, the *San-Jiao* (三焦, Triple Burner) becomes fiercely heated, and the *Wu-Zang* (五脏, Five Viscera) parched with drought. Even wood and stone wither and crack—how could a human not thirst?"*

The efficacy of treatment depends entirely on the patient’s compliance. If they adhere strictly to the prescriptions, recovery may be achieved within a decade; if they neglect self-care, death will follow swiftly. Medical texts abound with effective remedies, yet what benefit are they to those who do not exercise caution? There are three critical precautions: **1** abstaining from alcohol, **2** moderation in sexual activity, and **3** avoiding salty foods and fermented grains. Those who heed these may avoid illness even without medication; those who do not, though they possess *Jin-Dan* (金丹, Golden Elixir), cannot be saved. Reflect deeply and take heed.

Furthermore, it is said: *"Between those who recover from *Xiao-Ke* and those who do not, the decisive factor lies in whether they develop a great abscess (*Da-Yong*, 大痈). Why so? Those afflicted with *Xiao-Ke* will inevitably develop abscesses between the major joints, leading to their demise. Thus, the warning lies in the great abscess—prepare abscess remedies in advance to prevent it."*

There was a man whose *Xiao-Ke* and frequent urination began in spring, persisted through summer, and was treated with *Gua-Lou* (栝蒌) and *Fú* (豉, fermented soybean) juice, which gradually eased his thirst. Yet his urine remained excessive—over twenty times a day, often totaling three to four *sheng* (升), and even at remission, it did not drop below two *sheng*. Over time, urination ceased entirely, but he grew increasingly emaciated, his throat and lips parched, his breath shallow, unable to speak much, his heart restless with heat, and his legs aching. His appetite doubled, yet his strength did not improve—this condition was clearly caused by *Xu-Re* (虚热, False Heat). To treat it, he should take *Gua-Lou* juice long-term to dispel the heat; *Niu-Ru* (牛乳, cow’s milk) and *Xing-Li* (杏酪, apricot kernel paste) are excellent for nourishment. This method is particularly beneficial.

**Commentary** (*Lùn Yuē*):
The disease of **internal consumption** (*nèi xiāo*) arises from excessive internal heat. If urination exceeds intake, it drains one’s vitality, causing shortness of breath and extreme exhaustion.

In **internal consumption** (*nèi xiāo*), all ingested food is converted into urine, yet the patient feels no thirst. Over a span of ten years, the governor of Zìzhōu (梓州), **Lǐ Wén Bó** (李文博), had long consumed *Bái-Shí-Yīng* (白石英, white quartz). Suddenly, his sexual vitality surged, but after a month, he began to suffer from thirst. Over several days, his urination became excessive—up to a hundred times a day—despite all treatments worsening his condition. His body grew weak, unable to rise or rest; his spirit became confused, and his mouth and tongue parched until his death.

Though rare, this disease is indeed fearsome. When symptoms appear, the pulse is **deep, fine, and weak** (*chén-xì-wēi*). A decoction of **goji berry** (*Gǒu-Qǐ-Tāng*) proves effective, yet it cannot ensure lasting cure.

Taking **Lead-Elixir Powder** also reduces symptoms, and in between, one may administer **Propagating-Supplement Pills**.

**Goji Berry Decoction** (for treating thirst and excessive urination):
- Goji berry branches and leaves: 1 *jin*
- Coptis rhizome (*Huáng Lián*), Trichosanthes root (*Guā Luó Gen*), Glycyrrhiza (*Gān Cǎo*), Gypsum (*Shí Gāo*): each 3 *liǎng*

**Total five flavors**, finely chopped. Boil with 1 *dòu* of water, reducing to 3 *shāng*. Divide into five doses—three during the day, two at night. For severe cases, increase the dosage; drink immediately upon thirst.

**Lead-Elixir Powder** (for treating *xiao-ke* diabetes, stopping frequent urination, and resolving *zhong-xiao* internal consumption):
- Lead elixir (*Qiān Dān*), barite (*Hú Fěn*): each 2 *fèn*
- Glycyrrhiza (*Gān Cǎo*), Trichosanthes root (*Guā Luó Gen*): each 10 *fèn*
- White pitchstone (*Bái Shí Zhī*—*Zhǒu Hòu* text reads *Bèi Mǔ*, Fritillaria), Alisma (*Zé Xiè*), Gypsum (*Shí Gāo*), Red pitchstone (*Chì Shí Zhī*): each 5 *fèn*

**Total eight flavors**, sifted and ground. Take with water, 1 *fāng cùn* spoonful, three times daily; robust individuals may take 1.5 *fāng cùn* spoonfuls. Patients with one year of illness recover in one day; those with two years recover in two days. For extreme thirst, take two doses at night; reduce if abdominal pain occurs.

Pills are also effective—ten pills per dose.

Excessive use causes abdominal pain. **Zhang Wén Zhòng** states: If abdominal pain occurs, administer rice gruel to induce defecation. The *Bèi Jí Fāng* states: Alcohol should not be used for induction; instead, use barley gruel. The *Gǔ Jīn Lù Yàn Fāng* states: After taking this medicine, within three days, boil and mash sheep liver and stomach, taken on an empty stomach, or made into a soup. One should habitually consume bland foods until urination becomes frequent and salty-bitter, then take **Cistanche Pills** alongside the decoction for recovery. The formula for **Cistanche Pills** and the decoction appears in *Wài Tái* Volume 11.

**Poria-Supplement Pill** (*Xuān Bǔ Wán*—*Jí Yàn* names it **Propagating-Supplement Pills**), for treating kidney-related *xiao-ke* diabetes and frequent urination:
- Poria (*Fú Shén*), Astragalus (*Huáng Qí*), Ginseng (*Rén Shēn*), Ophiopogon (*Mài Mén Dōng*), Glycyrrhiza (*Gān Cǎo*), Coptis (*Huáng Lián*), Anemarrhena (*Zhī Mǔ*), Trichosanthes root (*Guā Luó Gen*): each 3 *liǎng*
- Cuscuta seed (*Tú Sī Zǐ*): 3 *hé*
- Cistanche (*Bó Róng*): 4 *liǎng*
- Gypsum (*Shí Gāo*), Prepared Rehmannia (*Gān Dì Huáng*): each 6 *liǎng*

**Total twelve flavors**, ground into powder. Mix with 3 *hé* of cow bile, kneaded with honey into pills the size of *wú zǐ* (schisandra berries). Take with *máo gēn* (imperata root) decoction, 30 pills per dose, twice daily, gradually increasing to 50 pills.

**Sour Jujube Pill** (for treating dry mouth and internal consumption):
- Sour jujubes: 1.5 *shāng*
- Dried pomegranate seeds (pickled): 5 *hé*
- Wolfberry fruit (*Fú Pén Zǐ*), Pueraria root (*Gē Gēn*): each 3 *liǎng*
- Trichosanthes root (*Guā Luó Gen*), Poria (*Fú Líng*): each 3.5 *liǎng*
- Ophiopogon (*Mài Mén Dōng*): 4 *liǎng*
- Honey (*Shí Mì*): 4.5 *liǎng*
- Cinnamon bark (*Guì Xīn*): 1.6 *zhū*
- Prunes (*Wū Méi*): 10 pieces

**Total ten flavors**, ground into powder, kneaded with honey into pills. Dissolve in the mouth as needed, day or night, until saliva returns—repeat until fully restored. No dietary restrictions.

**Treatment for internal consumption with day-and-night urination of 7–8 *shāng***:
Roast deer antlers until charred, grind into powder, and take with wine, 5 *fāng cùn* spoonfuls daily, three times, gradually increasing to 1 *fāng cùn* spoonful.

**Alternative formula**:
Boil 2 bundles of *kuí* (gourd) roots the size of a five-*shāng* basin (the *Wài Tái* text states five *dàn*) in 5 *dòu* of water, reducing to 3 *dòu*. Take on an empty stomach the next morning, 3 *shāng* per dose.

**Another method**:
Drink 1 *shāng* of fermented hemp seed juice.

The text states: *"Strong among the sick"*—those whose vitality is excessive, with erectile vigor yet spontaneous emission without intercourse.

**Discourse on the Causes of Thirst and Polyuria**:

The *Way* states: Among the many ways in which people exhaust themselves, those in their prime of vigor and strength do not guard against excess, indulging their passions and unrestrained desires, overindulging in *chamber arts* (房中). As they grow older, their *kidney-qi* (肾气) becomes depleted and exhausted, giving rise to myriad ailments.

Again, those who in their youth fear their inability to perform in *chamber arts* (房中) often consume *stone elixirs* (石散), thereby depleting their *true-qi* (真气). The *stone-qi* (石气) then stands alone, unbalanced—leading to mere *emptiness and dissipation* (虚耗), dry and parched lips, and spontaneous emission of *essence-fluid* (精液); or to *urine that is red and turbid* (小便赤黄), with *hard and dry feces* (大便乾实); or to *excessive thirst and frequent urination, up to ten shāng per day* (渴而且利，日夜一石); or to *thirst without frequent urination, or frequent urination without thirst*, where all consumed food transforms into *urine* (小便). These conditions are all caused by *excessive indulgence in chamber arts* (房室不节).

For ordinary individuals who experience *thirst in summer* (夏月喜渴), it stems from the *heart* (心王). When the *heart* (心王) induces *sweating* (便汗), the *kidney* (肾) becomes *dry and emaciated* (虚燥), hence the *thirst with scant urination* (渴而小便少). In winter, when there is no *sweating* (不汗), the *urine becomes abundant and frequent* (小便多而数). These are the signs of an ordinary person, known as *xiao-ke* (消渴).

However, if there is *frequent urination without drinking water* (小便利而不饮水), it indicates *kidney fullness* (肾实). The *Classics* state: *When the kidney is full, it consumes* (肾实则消). *Consumption* (消) refers to *frequent urination without thirst* (不渴而利). Therefore, those who take *stone elixirs* (石之人) and suffer from *frequent urination* (小便利), the *stone* (石) being of a nature that pertains to the *kidney* (归肾), the *kidney* (肾) receiving the *stone* (得石) becomes *full* (实), and *fullness* (实) can *consume water and fluids* (能消水浆), hence the *frequent urination* (故利). Excessive *urination* (利多) prevents the *kidney* from *nourishing the five zàng* (五脏), and when the *zàng* (脏) weaken, all manner of diseases arise.

Zhang Zhongjing (仲景) says: *When heat congeals in the middle burner* (热结中焦), it results in *hardness* (坚); *when heat congeals in the lower burner* (热结下焦), it causes *dysuria with blood* (溺血), also leading to *strangury* (淋闭不通). Though it is not necessary to enumerate all cases, one must recognize that *frequent urination* (小便利) is indeed a sign. Those with internal *heat* (内有热) will experience *thirst* (则喜渴); removing the *heat* (除热) will halt it. If *thirst is accompanied by emptiness* (渴兼虚), one must *remove heat and supplement emptiness* (须除热补虚) to achieve recovery.

**Treatment for *frequent urination without thirst* (不渴而小便大利), leading to death** (遂至於死):
Take **5 liǎng of *mǔlì* (oyster shell)** (牡蛎), decoct in **3 shāng of the patient’s urine** (患人尿), reducing to **2 shāng**. Divide and take in two doses; this method is *divinely efficacious* (神验).

**Donkey-Hide Gelatin Decoction** (Donkey-Hide Gelatin Decoction: *Ājiāo Tāng*)

For treating **Xiaoke** (消渴, *Xiaoke*):

**Donkey-Hide Gelatin** (阿胶, *Ājiāo*) – 2 *tǐng*
**Sesame Seeds** (麻子, *Mázǐ*) – 1 *shēng*
**Prepared Aconite** (附子, *Fùzǐ*) – 1 piece

**Moxibustion Method for Xiaoke (消渴, *Xiaoke*)**:

The text states: **"In cases where urination is frequent and copious, with the patient passing tens of times daily up to a *dàn* (石, ~100 *shāng*) of urine, repeated moxibustion over five days is beneficial."**

**Caution on Moxibustion for Chronic Xiaoke**:
"For those afflicted with **Xiaoke** for over **one hundred days**, moxibustion is forbidden. If applied, **pus will continuously drain from the wound**, leading to **abscesses and emaciation**, ultimately resulting in death. **Misapplication or injury is also taboo**; even if only a needle-sized wound is made, the urine consumed will **transform into pus within the wound** and drain out. If the **pus does not cease**, death is certain. **Exercise extreme caution.**"

For **newly diagnosed cases**, moxibustion may be applied as per the following prescriptions:

If **throat dryness** (咽喉乾) is the primary symptom of **Xiaoke**, moxibustion is applied to **Stomach Meridian Convergence Point** (胃管下输, *Wèiguǎn Xiàshū*), **three acupuncture points** (三穴, *Sānxué*) each for **100 *zhuàng*** (壮), located **three *cùn* below the 8th vertebra**, horizontally spaced **three *cùn* apart**, with moxibustion applied at **one *cùn* intervals**.

Alternatively, **moxibustion may be applied to the Chest Center** (胸堂, *Xiōngtáng*) for **50 *zhuàng***, and to **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳, *Zú Tàiyáng*) for **50 *zhuàng*** (as noted in *Huángdì Jīng*).

If **mouth dryness is unbearable** (口乾不可忍), apply moxibustion to **Small Intestine Convergence Point** (小肠输, *Xiǎocháng Xiàshū*) for **100 *zhuàng***, horizontally spaced **three *cùn* apart**, at **one *cùn* intervals**.

If **mouth dryness causes irritability and suffocation** (口乾烦闷), apply moxibustion to **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴, *Zú Juéyīn*) for **100 *zhuàng***, and to **Yang Pool** (阳池, *Yángchí*) for **50 *zhuàng***.

If **Xiaoke presents with coughing and retching** (咳逆), apply moxibustion to **Hand Jueyin** (手厥阴, *Shǒu Juéyīn*) for **100 *zhuàng*** (adjusted by age).

If **urination is frequent** (小便数), apply moxibustion to **both hands’ little fingers** (两手小指头) and **both feet’s little toes** (足两小趾头), as well as the **nape of the neck and cervical vertebrae** (并灸项椎, *Bìng jiū yǐngzhuī*). **Moxibustion at the central spine** (当脊梁中央解间一处) and **two points on the waist** (腰目上两处) is also recommended—**three points in total**.

Additionally, apply moxibustion to **Spleen Convergence Point** (脾输, *Pí Xiàshū*), **four *cùn* below the back**, near the **lumbar vertebrae** (侠脊梁, *Xià jǐliáng*), **two points total**.

All moxibustion treatments should be **adjusted according to the patient’s age** (随年壮).

Further, apply moxibustion to **two points on Kidney Convergence** (肾输, *Shèn Xiàshū*), and to **Waist Mark** (腰目, *Yāomiù*), located **three *cùn* below Kidney Convergence**, **one *cùn* and a half** on either side of the **lumbar spine** (侠脊骨两傍各一寸半). These points are **located by pressing with the fingers**.

Apply moxibustion to **one point at Guanyuan** (关元, *Guānyuán*), and **two points** on either side, **two *cùn* apart**.

Apply moxibustion to **two points at Yin Market** (阴市, *Yīnshì*), located **three *cùn* above the kneecap** (膝上当伏兔上行三寸), near the knee.

Alternatively, **arrange three or two points in a row**, spaced **one *cùn* apart**, known as **Kidney System** (肾系, *Shènxì*).

For **frequent but scanty and difficult urination**, where **straining causes seminal leakage** (用力辄失精), instruct the patient to **extend both hands**, **clasp them together**, and **align the thumbs**. Forcefully press until the **nails of both thumbs nearly touch**, then apply **moxibustion at the junction of the nail beds and flesh** (两爪甲本肉际), where a natural **ridge** (角) forms. Position the **moxa cone at the ridge**, allowing it to **slightly penetrate the nail surface**. **One cone is used for both thumbs**.

Alternatively, apply **moxibustion to the big toe** (脚大指) using the same method, **three cones total**. Repeat the treatment **after three days**.

**Prescriptions for Dysuria and Retention of Urine (Línbì Fāng) – Second Treatise on Dysuria**
**Symptoms, Prescriptions, and Moxibustion Methods**

The Treatise states:
When **heat** (熱) accumulates in the **middle burner** (中焦), it causes **hardness** (堅); when **heat** accumulates in the **lower burner** (下焦), it causes **dysuria with blood** (溺血), leading to **dysuria and retention** (淋閉不通). This often occurs in **depleted** (虛损) individuals who consume **large doses of medicinal decoctions** (大散), resulting in **extraneous heat** (客熱) in the lower burner.

There are also cases where the lower burner naturally harbors **heat** (熱), though it is usually mild and can be discerned through careful observation.

**Dysuria due to stagnant *qi*** (氣淋) manifests as **difficult and scanty urination** (溺難涩), with lingering drips (余沥).
**Dysuria from urinary stones** (石淋) presents with **pain in the urethra** (茎中痛), unable to fully void urine (溺不得卒出).
**Dysuria with sticky urine** (膏淋) shows urine resembling **pitch or resin** (膏), which passes spontaneously (自出).
**Dysuria from exertion** (勞淋) arises upon **fatigue or strain** (勞倦), with **pain radiating to the perineum** (氣冲下).
**Dysuria from heat** (熱淋) occurs with **heat** (熱), and in severe cases, **hematuria** (尿血) ensues. All such cases are treated similarly to **dysuria from stagnant *qi*** (氣淋).

If one observes **yellowish nasal tip** (鼻頭色黃), it indicates **difficult urination** (小便難).

**Dìfūzǐ Decoction** (地肤子汤) treats **lower burner heat accumulation** (下焦結熱), manifesting as **reddish-yellow, obstructed urine** (小便赤黃不利), **frequent but scanty urination** (数起出少), **urethral pain** (茎痛), or **blood in urine** (或血出). It is also used for **residual heat after febrile illness** (温病后余热), **post-dysentery heat retention** (霍乱后当风取热), **excessive alcohol consumption or sexual overindulgence** (过度饮酒房劳), **exposure to heat while walking** (行步冒热), or **dysuria from heat accumulation** (以饮逐热). This decoction also resolves **lower burner heat obstruction** (熱結下焦), **stone-induced urinary stasis** (散石熱動關格), **lower abdominal hardness** (小腹堅), and **distended bladder resembling a bowl** (胞胀如斗).

**Discourse on Water Edema (Fourth Treatise) – Symptoms, Prescriptions, and Moxibustion**

**On the Condition:**
Water disease is difficult to treat. After recovery, one must be especially cautious with diet. Moreover, those afflicted with water often indulge excessively in food without restraint, which is why this illness is hard to cure.

Many physicians, following the trends of their time, prioritize profit over life, neglecting the fundamental nature of the disease. When patients desire meat, these doctors urge them to consume the most luxurious cuts—such as lamb’s head and shanks—yet none who follow this method have ever seen a cure.

In water edema, both *qi* and water are excessive across all vessels. Treatments universally seek to purge them, yet lamb’s head and shanks are profoundly nourishing—how could such a contradiction ever effect a cure?

Thus, most water treatments employ **Gua Lou (Trichosanthes) seeds** and similar herbs. The *Pen Ts’ao* (Materia Medica) states: *"Prolonged use of Gua Lou renders one severely debilitated."* Therefore, water edema cannot be cured unless the root cause is addressed through prolonged depletion.

There are two types: **snakebite edema (蛊胀)**, where only the abdomen is distended without swelling, and **water edema (水胀)**, where the abdomen swells and the limbs and face become grossly enlarged. Some physicians fail to distinguish properly—treating snakebite edema with water-purging drugs and water edema with snakebite remedies, or simply prescribing water-purging drugs for any distension. Such errors align with Zhang Zhongjing’s warning: *"Foolish physicians kill their patients."*

Now, the following are prohibited:

- **Forbidden Foods & Actions:**
  Mourning rituals
  Postpartum lactation
  Music
  Sexual activity
  Loud laughter and merrymaking
  All fish
  All meat
  All raw or cold foods
  Vinegar, slippery foods
  Garlic
  Sticky foods (rice, beans, oil, grease)

**All the above must be strictly avoided**, both in consumption and in mental indulgence. What is not prohibited will be detailed under each prescription.

Regarding sexual activity and similar matters, caution must be observed for **three years**, lest the condition recur permanently.

「If not treated properly, even after remission, the condition will relapse, and relapses cannot be cured further.

The ancient prescriptions include the *Ten-Water Pill* (十水丸), but most cases result in loose stools rather than improved urination, which is why it is not recorded here.

The Yellow Emperor asked Qibo: *"How can one distinguish between water edema (水), skin distension (肤胀), drum distension (鼓胀), intestinal obstruction (肠覃), and stone-like concretion (石瘕)?"*

Qibo replied: *"When water edema first appears, the eyes are slightly swollen—like the state after waking from a nap—(《灵枢》、《太素》 describe this as slight abscesses), the neck pulse is active, coughing occurs intermittently, the groin and inner thighs feel cold, the legs swell, and the abdomen remains enlarged. Once the water has fully formed, pressing the abdomen causes the skin to rise with the hand, like wrapping around water. This is its characteristic sign.

How does one diagnose skin distension (肤胀)?*
Skin distension occurs when cold *qi* (寒气) lodges between the skin and muscles, causing a firm, taut swelling (《太素》、《外台》 describe it as not firm). The abdomen is enlarged, the entire body swells, the skin thickens, and pressing the abdomen leaves a depression (《太素》 describes this as a sunken back that does not rebound), with no color change in the abdomen. These are its signs.

What about drum distension (鼓胀)?
Drum distension presents as an enlarged, swollen abdomen, similar in size to skin distension, but with a grayish-yellow hue. The abdominal pulse is prominent—this is its characteristic sign.

How does one recognize intestinal obstruction (肠覃)?
Intestinal obstruction arises when cold *qi* (寒气) lodges outside the intestines, clashing with the *Wei* *qi* (卫气) and impeding the flow of *Zheng* *qi* (正气). If there is an obstruction caused by some binding force, stagnant *qi* (恶气) will emerge, leading to polyp formation. Initially, these polyps resemble chicken eggs, gradually growing larger until they resemble a fetus in the womb. In chronic cases, they exceed a year in duration. When pressed, they feel firm, and when pushed, they shift. Menstrual flow may still occur, but irregularly—these are its signs.

What about stone-like concretion (石瘕)?
Stone-like concretion forms within the uterus, where cold *qi* (寒气) lodges at the *zi men* (子门, uterine opening), obstructing the flow of *qi* (气) and preventing stagnant blood from discharging. Instead, it accumulates, growing larger day by day until it resembles a fetus in the womb. Menstrual flow becomes irregular, and this condition occurs only in women. It can be induced to discharge through treatment.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Can skin distension (肤胀) and drum distension (鼓胀) be treated with acupuncture?"*
Qibo replied: *"First, drain the blood vessels in the abdomen, then regulate the meridians, and finally puncture the blood vessels to remove the obstruction."*

The Master said: *"There are also five types of water edema: wind water (风水), skin water (皮水), true water (正水), stone water (石水), and yellow sweating (黄汗).*
Wind water is characterized by a floating pulse, joint pain, and aversion to wind.

Skin water also presents with a floating pulse, but its external signs are superficial swelling. Pressing leaves a depression where the fingers sink in, and there is no aversion to wind. The abdomen remains unchanged (《要略》、《巢源》 describe it as neither full nor empty), and the patient should be induced to sweat.

True water is marked by a deep, slow pulse and spontaneous dyspnea.

Stone water has a deep pulse and abdominal fullness (《脉经》 describes this as pain), without dyspnea.

Yellow sweating exhibits a deep, rapid pulse, feverish body, chest fullness, and swelling of the limbs, face, and head. If untreated for long, it will inevitably lead to abscesses and pus formation. The patient feels heavy and swollen (some texts describe it as generalized edema with shortness of breath), unable to lie down, restless and irritable, with severe swelling in the groin.

Liver water manifests as a greatly distended abdomen, preventing the patient from turning or rolling. The lower abdomen and sides are painful, and saliva occasionally forms. Urination remains continuous, though scanty.

Spleen water presents as an enlarged abdomen with heavy limbs, no saliva formation, but persistent shortness of breath and difficulty in urination.

Lung water causes the body to swell with difficulty in urination, and intermittent frothy urine resembling duck droppings (鸭溏).

Kidney water results in an enlarged abdomen, umbilical swelling, and lumbar pain. The patient cannot urinate, with dampness in the groin like a cow’s nose, excessive sweating, and cold extremities. The face paradoxically becomes emaciated.

The Master said: *"In treating water edema, if swelling occurs below the waist, induce urination; if above the waist, induce sweating—this will restore the patient to health."*

The questioner asked: *"Why does a patient have diarrhea followed by excessive thirst, difficulty in urination, abdominal fullness, and swelling?"*

The Master replied: *"This indicates a water edema condition. If urination improves naturally or sweating occurs, the patient will recover (some texts say the condition will resolve by the end of the month).*

In general, the early signs of water edema include slight swelling above both eyes, resembling the color of an old silkworm, with neck pulse activity and coldness in the groin. The legs feel full, pressing leaves a depression, and the abdomen emits sounds when turned or rolled. These are its initial signs.

If not treated promptly, the body will soon swell slightly, and the abdomen will become uniformly distended. Pressing it causes the skin to rise with the hand, confirming the water has fully formed—but it can still be treated. Such conditions all stem from constitutional weakness.

There are ten types of water edema, but five are incurable:
1. Blackened lips (唇黑) harm the liver;
2. Flatness at the clavicle (缺盆平) harms the heart;
3. Umbilical protrusion (脐出) harms the spleen;
4. Flatness of the back (背平) harms the lungs;
5. Fullness below the feet (足下平满) harms the kidneys.

These five conditions are fatal and cannot be treated. In all cases of water edema, avoid abdominal swelling with external fluid discharge, as this is a grave sign—such patients will die within a month.

For *Black Round* (黑圆) edema of the gallbladder (胆玄水), swelling begins from the head and face down to the feet. The patient experiences dizziness and headache, general weakness, and fever. This is called *Black Water* (玄水), characterized by body swelling, constipation in both urination and defecation—this prescription is suitable. The formula appears in the fifth + eight volume.

For small intestine water edema, the lower abdomen is full, with sudden swelling and a bitter, dry mouth—use the following prescription:
Take 30 *Ba Dou* (巴豆, croton seeds), scrape off their skin, and crush them. Boil in five *sheng* (升) of water until reduced to three *sheng*, soak a cloth in the liquid, and wipe the swollen areas. The swelling will reduce with each application. Repeat five or six times daily, but avoid the eyes and genitals.

The *Ji Yan* (集验) text describes a remedy for sudden body swelling like being inflated: (formula omitted).

**Treatment for Large Intestine Water (alternating constipation and diarrhea):**
*Red Adzuki Beans (赤小豆), five sheng*
*Sang White Bark (桑白皮), sliced, two sheng*
*Crucian Carp (鲤鱼), four jin*

Take the four ingredients, coarsely chop, and boil in three *dou* of water until the fish is thoroughly cooked. Do not add salt. Remove the fish and consume it entirely, then strain the broth to obtain about four *sheng*. Drink the decoction slowly.

**Alternative Prescription:**
*Mutton (羊肉), one jin, sliced*
*Dang Gui (当归), one sheng*

Take the two ingredients, boil in two *dou* of water. First, cook the *Dang Gui* until tender, then remove the dregs. Add the mutton along with scallions, fermented soybean paste, and vinegar, following the same method as the *Black Water* prescription.

Take in three divided doses.

If coughing occurs, add *Schisandra (五味子), three liang*. Generally, take three doses, then one dose every five days. This prescription is consistently effective.

Many suffer from chronic dyspnea and persistent edema, with water accumulating beneath the skin, attacking the face and upper body from the waist up. All such cases can be treated with this decoction to induce sweating, ensuring complete recovery:

*Ephedra (麻黄), four liang*
*Licorice (甘草), two liang*

Take the two ingredients, coarsely chop, and boil in five *sheng* of water. First boil the Ephedra until it boils again, then skim off the foam, add Licorice, and reduce to three *sheng*. Take in three divided doses to induce sweating until cured. Be cautious of wind and cold.

In the ninth year of Zhenguan (正观), the Prince of Hanyang suffered from water disease, which conventional medicine could not cure. I administered this prescription, and he urinated one to two *dou* daily, recovering within five to six days. After recovery, he occasionally relapsed but was otherwise cured. This is truly a divine prescription.

**Prescriptions from the *Chuai Shi* (崔氏)**

It says: *"Mix with honey and form into pills; serve with honey decoction."* For cases where a person suffers from **water edema** (水肿), with a distended abdomen as hard as stone, slender limbs, and where even slight exertion causes swelling of the feet and ankles, and where drinking or eating provokes **shortness of breath** (气急), this being a lifelong ailment—when conventional **diuretic and purgative** (利下) medicines fail to cure—this prescription should be administered. It will gradually eliminate **wind-dampness** (风湿), facilitate **urination** (小便), and disperse **water and grain dampness** (水谷). Taken over time, its efficacy will manifest. After recovery, one may take it regularly as a preventive measure:

**Ghost Arrow Herb** (鬼箭羽) **5 liang**
**Salvia Root** (丹参) **5 liang**
**Atractylodes** (白朮) **5 liang**
**Angelica Root** (独活) **5 liang**

**Kelp** (海藻) **2 liang**
**Poria** (茯苓) **2 liang**
**Cinnamon** (桂心) **2 liang**

Grind the above ten ingredients into a coarse powder. Soak in **3 dou of wine** (酒) for five days. Take **5 ge of the decoction** (五合), three times daily, gradually increasing the dosage according to one’s tolerance and strength.

For **water edema** (水肿), **urinary difficulty** (小便不利), **alcohol-induced heat** (酒客虚热), **wind-dampness consumption** (当风饮玲水), **abdominal distension** (腹肿), and **scrotal swelling** (阴胀满), the following prescription is effective:

**Desmodium Stem** (当陆) **4 liang**
**Sweet Cane** (甘遂) **1 liang**
**Mirabilite** (芒硝) **2 liang**
**Daphne Genkwa** (芫花) **2 liang**
**Evodia Fruit** (吴茱萸) **2 liang**

Grind the above five ingredients into a powder, mix with honey to form pills the size of **Firmiana seeds** (梧子), and take three pills with water, three times daily.

For **persistent water edema** (久水), where the abdomen swells like a drum, use the **Black Soybean Powder** (大豆散):

**Black Soybeans** (乌豆) **1 dou**
Roast until fragrant, but do not overcook. Remove the skins and grind into a fine powder. Sift, and take with **congee or gruel** (粥). Begin with **1 ge** (一合), gradually increasing the dose. If the odor becomes unbearable after initial use, continue until the prescription is finished, then prepare a fresh batch. Stop when symptoms abate. Avoid **rich, greasy foods** (肥腻); if thirsty, drink **soup broth** (羹汁). Strictly abstain from **alcohol, meat, pork, chicken, fish, raw cold foods, slippery or glutinous substances, and sexual activity** (房室). Consume only **porridge, milk, or lean meats such as beef, mutton, rabbit, and venison** (浆粥、牛羊兔鹿肉). Even if one can tolerate these foods during times of great hunger or thirst, one should still avoid them.

This ailment is difficult to treat. Though many powerful **pills, powders, decoctions, and plasters** (丸散汤膏) may temporarily alleviate symptoms, they often recur later. Only this powder ensures lasting relief—taking it regularly prevents recurrence for life. Its restricted diet must be adhered to in moderation; do not indulge in **salty or miscellaneous foods** (咸物诸杂食) at will.

Another prescription:
**Balloonflower Root** (葶苈), ground into powder **2 + 1 spoonfuls** (二＋匕)
**Xanthium Fruit** (苍耳子), burned into ash **2 + 1 spoonfuls** (二＋匕)

For **water-qi edema** (水气肿), **abdominal distension** (鼓胀), and **urinary difficulty** (小便不利), the following is effective:

**Desmodium Stem** (莫若子) **1 sheng**
**Sheep Lung** (投羊肺), one whole lung (preferably from a **green sheep** (青羊))

Wash the sheep lung, then simmer it in a shallow decoction. Slice thinly and dry in the sun. Grind into a powder. Soak **Desmodium Stem** in **three-year-old vinegar** (三年大酢) for **one shao** (晬时), then remove and roast until its color changes. Pound until it becomes like mud. Mix with the sheep lung powder, knead with honey, and pound **3,000 times** (三千杵) to form pills the size of **Firmiana seeds** (梧子). Take four pills with **Ophiopogon Drink** (麦门冬饮) after a meal, three times daily. Observe the symptoms of **dry throat, sticky mouth, and incoherent speech** (浪语) as indicators. After several days, if urination improves significantly, the treatment is successful.

**Mountain Cnidium** (山连) cured **Wei Siyu** (韦司业), whose nephew said it was a prescription sent by **Emperor Taizong** (表), and that it had proven miraculously effective in multiple uses.

The **Ophiopogon Drink** (麦门冬饮) prescription:

For **water-qi edema** causing severe generalized swelling, unresponsive to other treatments, and nearing death:

**Fresh Hemp Seeds** (大麻子), thoroughly selected, one *dan*;
**Adzuki Beans** (赤小豆), pure and unadulterated, one *dan*.

Both must be freshly harvested and refined. Wash and dry in the sun, then steam the hemp seeds until cooked, dry again, and store in a clean container.

To prepare, take five *sheng* of hemp seeds, roast until golden and fragrant (using slow fire to prevent burning), then grind into an extremely fine powder. Extract the juice with five *sheng* of water, strain, and store in a clean, sealed vessel.

The night before taking, soak one *sheng* of **Adzuki Beans** in clean water until morning, then drain and dry. Boil the beans in fresh water until nearly cooked, drain, and mix with the hemp juice. Simmer until thoroughly softened. Take on an empty stomach, three times daily. Initially, a **stifling sensation** (小心闷) may occur but will soon pass.

After five days, urination will increase, possibly with red urine, sticky saliva, and dry mouth—do not be alarmed. After completing the treatment, engage in **gentle movement** (微行); if unable, lie down. On the tenth day, **acupuncture** (针) and **moxibustion** (灸) the **Stomach 36** (三里) and **Stomach 37** (绝骨) points to release **qi**; otherwise, **qi** will not disperse, and the medicine will be ineffective.

Five days later, if **counterflow** (逆) prevents further doses, take a **dead crucian carp** (大鲤鱼), remove scales and tail, boil to remove slime, clean, open, and remove entrails. Mix the remaining hemp juice and **Adzuki Beans**, then cook into a porridge with **garlic** (葱), **fermented soybean** (豉), **tangerine peel** (橘皮), **fresh ginger** (生姜), and **perilla** (紫苏). Consume throughout the treatment, strictly avoiding bathing.

When thirsty, drink **hemp juice**—warm in autumn and winter, cold in spring and summer. Always eat until just sated, no more than to stave off hunger. Avoid **sexual activity**, anger, loud speech, high-pitched voices, alcohol, oil, vinegar, raw or cold foods, vegetables, all fish and meat, pickled dishes, and the five pungent spices.

This cures ten out of ten cases, with divine efficacy. It also treats all **qi-related ailments**; those who take it recover fully within a month of daily administration. Collect **hemp seeds** when ripe, store in fresh jars, and distribute to others.

**Formula #22:**
**Evodia (吴茱萸)**, **Ligusticum (华拨)**, **Kombu (昆布)**, **Apricot Kernel (杏仁)**, **Lappula (葶苈)**—equal parts.
Powder and form into honey pills the size of *wuzi* seeds. For **breathlessness**, take five pills on an empty stomach, ensuring no overeating. If **counterflow** or **breathlessness** occurs after eating, take them immediately to disperse the **qi**.

**Bitter Gourd (苦瓠) Pills** for **edema (大水)**, where the head, face, and body swell severely, and the abdomen is distended:
Take **bitter gourd** and **white **Akebia (白禳) fruit**, knead into the size of large beans, wrap in dough, boil until just simmered, and swallow seven pieces on an empty stomach. By noon, one *sheng* of urine should pass. Over three to four days, urine will continue to flow without stopping, and the patient will grow significantly thinner before recovery. For three years afterward, be cautious with dietary flavors.

Use only the finest **bitter gourd**, free of blemishes, with fine texture, and thoroughly cleaned—otherwise, it is toxic and unusable. *Chui Shi’s method* uses the seeds to make dumplings, taking fourteen pieces. If fearing **emptiness (虚)**, take with cow’s milk. Administer alternately each day, gradually increasing to twenty-one pieces, stopping when urination improves. If urination is excessive, pause for one to two days.

**Formula for whole-body edema:**
Decoct **Sichuan peppercorn (猪椒) branches and leaves** like intestines. Take one spoonful on an empty stomach, three times daily. For itching, wash with the decoction.

**Another formula:**
**Bitter gourd membrane (苦瓠膜)**—2 *fen*, **Lappula (葶苈子)**—5 *fen*.
Combine and knead into pills the size of small beans. Take five pills daily, three times.

**Another formula:**
Decoct human urine until it can be formed into pills. Take pills the size of small beans, three times daily.

**Formula #23:**
**Lappula (葶苈)**, **Peach Kernel (桃仁)**—equal parts.
Toast both, knead into pills, and take to promote urination. Some versions use **Apricot Kernel (杏仁)** instead.

**Another formula:**
Seven **jujubes (大枣)**, **bitter gourd membrane** the size of jujube pits.
Knead into pills. Take three pills at a time, then after walking fifteen *li*, take another three. If urination occurs, take one more to stop.

**Another formula:**
Knead raw **Lappula (葶苈子)** and take with alcohol, adjusting dosage by the frequency of urination.

**Another formula:**
Burn **ginger stone (姜石)** until red, immerse in black cow’s urine until heated, and drink one *sheng* daily.

**Another formula:**
Drinking cow’s urine alone is highly effective.

For all **water-related illnesses**, begin with small doses and stop once urination improves.

**Another formula:**
Moxibustion at the second toe, one *cun* upward, adjusted by age and strength. Also, moxibustion at the junction of both thumbs, seven times.

If urination remains obstructed, add **raw Cantharis (生大戟)**—1 *sheng*, and **Lappula (葶苈)**—2 *liang*. This will ensure prompt urination without failure.

*Shen Shi’s method* omits **Tuckahoe (猪苓)**, **Alisma (泽泻)**, **Aconite (乌头)**, **Pinellia (半夏)**, and **Euphorbia (甘遂)**.

**Hemp Seed Decoction** for **generalized fluid retention (遍身流肿):**
**Hemp Seeds (麻子)**—5 *sheng*;
**Red Adzuki Beans (赤小豆)**—3 *sheng*;
**Solanum nigrum (当陆)**—1 *jin*;
**Saposhnikovia (防风)**—3 *liang*;
**Aconite (附子)**—1 *liang*.
Chop finely, first pounding the hemp seeds until ripe. Decoct in 30 *sheng* of water, reducing to 13 *sheng*, then add the remaining herbs and beans, decocting to 4 *sheng*. Strain and drink with the beans.

**Soybean Decoction** for **new or chronic edema in men and women**, sudden exposure to **malignant wind (暴恶风)** entering the abdomen, or postpartum women where **wind enters the viscera**, causing abdominal distension like a **horsewhip**, with labored breathing and coughing:
Use **soybeans (大豆)**—10 *sheng*, cleaned. Decoct in 50 *sheng* of water, reducing to 15 *sheng*, then strain and return to the pot. Add 15 *sheng* of wine, decocting to 9 *sheng*. Avoid food the night before. At dawn, take 3 *sheng* warm, cover to induce sweating. Within two meals, **wind will be expelled**, edema will subside, and caution against **wind and cold** is advised for ten days to ensure full recovery.

On the day of cessation, take it together for optimal effect. If the urgency is severe and cannot be endured, administer it to expel the urgency. If the edema does not fully subside, repeat the dose; if it is mostly resolved, take three *sheng* more. If it is entirely resolved, do not take it again. During the illness, one may also drink freely as desired, ensuring the **qi** of the wine harmonizes with the body’s state.

The *Zhǒuhòu* [《肘后》] states: If the edema is mostly resolved but thirst persists, be cautious not to drink excessively.

Another prescription: Bundle **ramie bark and leaves (chǔpí zhīyè)**—one large handful, cut, and decoct to obtain the juice. Ferment it into wine according to the quantity needed, and drink until intoxication. Within three to four days, the edema will significantly subside, and afterward, it may be taken regularly.

One alternative uses **pork pepper bark and leaves (zhūjiāo pí zhīyè)**.

Another prescription: A **crucian carp (lǐyú)** of fifteen *cùn* in length. Soak it in urine overnight. At dawn, pierce it from mouth to tail with a wooden skewer and roast it over gentle fire until just cooked. Remove the skin. Avoid food the night before and take it on an empty stomach in one dose. If unable to consume all at once, divide it into two servings. Do not add salt. Apply the fish paste externally to treat the surface. For any edema, one must employ a hundred methods—both internal and external—to attack it; no single remedy suffices universally.

**Recipe for External Application:**
Take **fresh dodder (shēngdàng)**—one *jīn* (斤), and **pork fat (zhūgāo)**—one *jīn*. Decoct together until the mixture turns yellow. Strain and apply to the edema. Alternatively, take a small amount internally as well, and spread it on the affected area. Cover with paper, and reapply when dry. The edema will resolve within three days.

**Musk Powder (Shèxiāng sǎn)** for **women with shortness of breath and emaciation from deficiency (虚羸)**, whose entire body is **floatingly swollen (fúzhǒng)**, with taut skin—an uncommon condition:

**Realgar (xiónghuáng)**—6 *zhǔ*
**Daphne genkwa (yuánhuā)**—2 *liǎng* (两)
**Sweet Sophora (gānsuì)**—2 *liǎng*

Combine these four ingredients and sift. Take with wine—5 *chǐ* (匕) of powder, adjusting the dose for the elderly or young as needed. Alternatively, make into pills the size of small beans. The strong may take seven pills.

From *Xiǎopǐn* [《小品》], omit **realgar (xiónghuáng)**.
From *Shēnshī* [《深师》], make into honey pills the size of large beans. Take two pills, three times daily.

To treat **dysfunction of the Triple Burner (Sānjiāo)**, with water lodged externally in the chest—**Water Disease (shuǐbìng)**—where the abdomen is **cloudy#26 and enlarged**, use **Large Galingale Pill (Dàkāngxiāng wán)** externally. The *Huàtá Prescriptions* [《华佗方》] and *Zhǒuhòu* [《肘后》] include **ginseng (rénshēn)**—2 *liǎng*, made into pills for oral use.

For **emaciation from deficiency (虚láo)** and **floating edema (fúzhǒng)**:
Moxibustion at **Great Rushing (Tàichōng)**—100 *zhuàng* (壮), and again at **Kidney Confluence (Shènshǔ)**.

**Prescriptions for *Dīngzhǒng*#1: First Treatise on *Dīngzhǒng*
**Symptoms | Prescriptions | Acupuncture & Moxibustion Methods**

The treatise states:
The human body, in its formation, must be preserved and nourished; if one fails to regulate rest and activity, diseases will arise. Thus, the four seasons transform, and *yin* and *yang* alternate in their flourishing. When these two *qi* forces clash violently, it is inevitable that **pathogenic#4 *fùqi*#5** will emerge. Such **pathogenic *fùqi*** occurs every month. Sudden exposure to **great wind (dàfēng)**, **great mist (dàwù)**, **great cold (dàhán)**, or **great heat (dàrè)**—if not avoided in due time—will strike the body, impairing the skin, flooding the meridians, and causing **residual *lì*#6** to stagnate, while **nutritive and defensive *qi*#7** congeal. This obstruction prevents *yin* and *yang* from venting properly, leading to **boils and carbuncles (yōngjū)**, ***Dīngdú*#8**, and **malignant sores (èchuāng)****, all of which manifest as swellings.

As for ***Dīngzhǒng*#9**, if not recognized beforehand, it will kill a person before noon. If one waits until it has fully developed before seeking treatment, the patient is already beyond recovery. Therefore, those who cultivate longevity must study this prescription early. No matter the type of **ulcerous swelling (chuāngyí)**, none can escape its effects.

In treating ***Dīngzhǒng*#9**, one must **prick the center until bleeding**, and also **prick the edges ten or more times** to induce bleeding. After removing the blood, apply the medicine—this allows the **drug’s *qi*** to penetrate the needle holes most effectively. If the treatment does not reach the **sore’s core**, it will lack efficacy.

The **swelling** of *Dīngzhǒng* often appears on the inner cheeks or tongue, **reddish-black like pearls**, and causes **aching pain that resonates in the heart**. This is a **chronic accumulation of autumn-winter cold toxins** within the skin, transforming into this ailment. If left untreated, the **root of the disease** will grow by day and night, spreading through multiple meridians, **fixing the body like an arrow lodged deep**, rendering it immobile. If one does not **heed dietary and sexual precautions**, death will follow swiftly.

If the swelling does not subside after five or six days, symptoms such as **flickering lights in the eyes (yǎnzhōng jiàn huǒguāng)**, **aversion to light (shénzèng)**, **dry mouth (kǒugān)**, and **restlessness of the heart (xīnfán)** appear—**death is imminent**.

1. **Hemp-seed *Dīng* (Mázǐ Dīng)**: The swelling **begins as a nodule on the flesh**, the size of **millet grains**, slightly black with **edges faintly red**, and often **itchy**. Avoid consuming **hemp seeds** or wearing **hemp cloths**, and **do not enter hemp fields**.

2. **Stone *Dīng* (Shídīng)**: The swelling **connects skin and flesh**, appearing **jet-black like black beans**, **extremely hard**, and **unpenetrable by pricking**. The **inner flesh** feels **dullly painful**. Avoid **tiles, rubble, and stones**.

3. **Male *Dīng* (Xióngdīng)**: The swelling **forms a black, raised pustule**, with **edges upturned**, **pus-filled blisters**, and **yellowish fluid discharge** like **water**, **the size of a coin’s hole**, and **elevated in shape**. Avoid **sexual activity**.

4. **Female *Dīng* (Cídīng)**: The swelling **appears as a yellowish pustule**, with **edges depressed**, also resembling **a moxibustion burn**, **blisters forming at the edges**, and **a sunken center with red hue**, **the size of a coin’s hole**. Avoid **sexual activity**.

5. **Fire *Dīng* (Huǒdīng)**: The swelling **resembles a scald from hot water or fire**, with **a blackened pustule**, **blisters at the edges**, and **a raised form like red millet grains**. Avoid **exposure to flames, scorching heat, or burning objects**.

6. **Rotten *Dīng* (Làndīng)**: The swelling **has a slightly blackened appearance with white scars**, **the sore breaks open**, and **pus discharges**. The **size varies like a spoon’s face**. Avoid **boiling-hot foods or rotting fabrics**.

7. **Thirty-six *Dīng* (Sānshíliù Dīng)**: The swelling **appears as black, raised nodules**, **the size of black beans**, with **large red rims**. It **emerges one per day**, then **two the next**, then **three**, and so on, up to **ten**. If **thirty-six swellings** fully develop, **no medicine can cure it**. If fewer than **thirty-six swellings** appear, it **may still be treated**.

---

**8. Black *Dīng* (Hēi Dīng)**: Commonly known as *Hēi Dīng*. Avoid **anger and repressed sorrow**.

**8. Snake-Eye *Dīng* (Shéyǎn Dīng)**: The swelling **has a blackened pustule**, **raised upon the skin**, **the size of small beans**, **resembling a snake’s eye**, and **is generally hard**. Avoid **being looked upon by an evil eye**, **envy or jealousy from others**, and **poisonous medicines**.

**9. Salt-Skin *Dīng* (Yánfū Dīng)**: The swelling **is as large as a spoon’s face**, **with red rims all around**, and **has black millet-grain-like nodules rising**. Avoid **salty foods**.

**10. Water-Washed *Dīng* (Shuǐxǐ Dīng)**: The swelling **is as large as a coin**, **or as large as a coin’s hole**, with **a white pustule**, **surrounded by blackened edges**, and **a fluid discharge that is slightly hard**. Avoid **drinking whey**, **washing with water**, or **crossing rivers**.

**11. Sickle *Dīng* (Dāolián Dīng)**: The swelling **is broad or narrow like a lotus leaf**, **one inch long**, with **blackened flesh on the left side resembling burns**. Avoid **pricks or cuts from sickles or knives**, and **injuries from iron blades**. These **can be treated with medicine**.

**12. Floating *Dīng* (Fú’ào Dīng)**: The swelling **is curved and rounded**, **slightly unclosed**, **long and narrow like a lotus leaf**, with **yellow interior and black exterior**. **Pricking the blackened area causes no pain**, but **pricking the yellow interior causes pain**.

**13. Ox-Restraint *Dīng* (Niújū Dīng)**: The swelling **has raised flesh that cannot be broken by pinching**.

---
For the **thirteen types of *Dīng*** mentioned above, **the initial symptoms are always itching followed by pain**, **cold followed by heat**, and **heat subsiding into cold**. They often cause **heaviness in the limbs**, **headaches**, **fright**, and **blurred vision**. If **the condition is severe**, **vomiting may occur**, and **vomiting cases are difficult to treat**.

The **Itch *Dīng* (Mázǐ Dīng)** is **the only type where itching persists from start to finish**. The **precautions listed** must **not be violated**; if they are, **treatment becomes difficult**.

The **Floating *Dīng* (Fú’ào Dīng)** and **Ox-Restraint *Dīng* (Niújū Dīng)** have **no specific prohibitions**. Even if **untreated**, they **cannot kill a person**. Their **symptoms of cold and heat align with those of other *Dīng*** types, and **all can be treated with this formula**, with **a success rate of ten thousand out of ten thousand**.

To **recognize the danger of violating precautions**, observe **a stiffened spine** and **unbearable pustule pain**.

**Treatment for the thirteen types of *Dīng* (Shísān Zhǒng Dīng Fāng)**:
Use **Gǒuqǐ** (Lycium fruit).

The **medicine** has **four names**: in **Spring** it is called **Celestial Essence** (Tiān Jīng), in **Summer** **Lycium Fruit** (Gǒuqǐ), in **Autumn** **Turn Back Aging** (Què Lǎo), and in **Winter** **Earth Bone** (Dì Gǔ).

In the **first three days of the third month of Spring**, gather the leaves on **auspicious days**; in the **first three days of the third month of Summer**, gather the branches on **auspicious even-numbered days**; in the **first three days of the third month of Autumn**, gather the seeds on **auspicious days**; in the **first three days of the third month of Winter**, gather the roots on **auspicious days**. Whenever the **auspicious days** first appear in any of the four seasons, collect the **branches, leaves, seeds, and roots**—all four—and dry them in the sun. If obtained on the **fifth day of the fifth month at noon**, it is even more potent.

If one cannot gather according to the proper method, even a single type suffices. Wrap the medicine in **a crimson silk cloth**, using just enough to cover it, in a size comparable to **a fistful of disordered hair** or **a cow’s gallbladder and Chinese wolfberry seed**. Mix **twenty-seven needles of Reverse Hook Thorn Acupuncture** (Fǎn Gōu Jié Zhēn), **seven red adzuki beans**, and apply them thinly atop the crimson silk. Then roll the cloth into a bundle, binding it with **ten cross-ties of disordered hair**, and parch it over **rapid central fire** until the steam rises. Once the steam subsides, let it dry naturally. Grind the dried bundle into powder, sift through silk, and measure with **a one-cubic-inch spoon**. Combine the **four types of Lycium**, grind them, sift through silk, and take **two spoonfuls** of the powder. Mix it with the earlier **one spoonful**, making a total of **three spoonfuls**, ensuring the properties harmonize. Divide into two portions: **one to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach with wine**, twice daily.

**The Honorable Old Lady Róng’s Formula from Qí Prefecture**—for all **types of *Dīng* (Dīng Zhǒng)**—uses:
- **Oyster shell (Mǔlì)**, nine *liǎng* (3.6 *catty*), if rotten, use **Chóngrú** instead
- **Lycium root and bark (Gǒuqǐ Gēn Pí)**, two *liǎng* each
- **White stone (Bái Shíyīng)**, one *liǎng*
- **Platycodon root (Jiégěng)**, one and a half *liǎng*
- **White ginger (Bái Jiāngshí)**, one *jīn* (16 *liǎng*), if soft and yellow

Grind these **six ingredients** into powder, sift through silk, and blend thoroughly. First, take **Fùlóng Gān** (Scolopendra), nine *shēng* (3 *liǎng*), and make into powder. Mix with **one *dòu* (10 *shāng*) of clear wine**, stir until uniform, and strain off the clear liquid. Take **two *shēng*** of the strained liquid, blend with the medicine, and knead into **a pill six divisions large and two divisions thick**. The remaining dregs are placed back in the basin. The pill is then steamed in a **bamboo basket** over the basin, covered with **a sheet of paper**, and sealed with mud for **three times seven days**. Once dry, store in **a paper bag** in a dry place.

**Method of use**: Acupuncture the **center of the pustule** with a needle, piercing to its root and also around its **four sides** to draw blood. Then scrape and apply **a dose of medicine the size of a large soybean** onto the pustule. For severe cases, apply **three to four times daily**; for mild cases, **once to twice**. In severe cases, the root will rot and appear within **two days**; in mild cases, within **half a day to one day**. When the pustule **floats up**, it is a sign the root has emerged. If the root has already rotted upon emergence, **do not cease applying the medicine**.

This medicine is **exceptionally stable**, promoting **fresh tissue growth** and quick healing. If the **pustule lies within the throat, mouth, chest, or abdomen**, it will **manifest externally as abnormal swelling**. When **cold and heat symptoms persist**, suspect this disease. Mix **a dose of medicine the size of five Chinese dates** with **wine or plain water**, and administer **three to four times daily**. The swelling will **naturally dissolve and rot**. If vomiting occurs due to external manipulation, the root will emerge with the vomit. If the root does not emerge, the condition will still resolve. Observe the patient’s **vitality and self-awareness** for signs of improvement.

The **fifth day of the fifth month** is the **optimal time** for combining the medicine, followed by the **seventh day of the seventh month**, then the **ninth day of the ninth month** and the **twelfth month’s *Là* day**. If the medicine is urgently needed on other days, it may still be used, though it will **not be as effective**.

When preparing the medicine, **keep the environment pure** and **burn incense**. **Do not allow it to be touched by impurities**, nor **seen by filial children, incomplete initiates, postpartum women, or livestock such as chickens and dogs**. Those afflicted with this disease must **avoid sexual activity, pork, beef, chicken, fish, raw chives, leeks, garlic, Chinese cabbage, coriander, hemp sesbania, vinegar, fermented grains, or Lycium root**. If **precautions are violated** and symptoms worsen, use **Lycium root decoction** mixed with the medicine and taken as directed, along with the **following formula**.

The **second formula** is **of the same lineage**, but **wise practitioners** consider the **first formula** the **true original**.

**Zhào Ráo’s Formula**:
- **White ginger (Bái Jiāngshí)**, two and five *liǎng* (2.5 *catty*)
- **Oyster shell (Mǔlì)**, ten *liǎng* (4 *catty*), though **Chuī Shì’s text** lists seven *liǎng* (2.8 *catty*)
- **Poria (Fúlíng)**, three *liǎng*
- **Lycium root and bark (Gǒuqǐ Gēn Pí)**, four *liǎng*

Grind these **four ingredients** and sift through silk. First, take **fresh Lycium root and bark**, cut into **six *shēng* (1.8 *catty*)**, and decoct with **one and a half *dòu* (15 *catty*) of water**, reducing to **five *shēng*** of liquid. Remove the dregs and add **two *shēng* of fresh dog dung** (or **urine**, as **Chuī Shì’s text** states). Stir until blended, strain off the clear liquid, and mix it with the earlier medicine. Knead into **a pill**, dry in the shade.

For the patient, **acupuncture the pustule directly on the head** with a **two-edged needle**, ensuring the pain is piercing before withdrawing the needle. Scrape and apply the **medicine powder into the pustule’s hole**, **without allowing the breath to touch it**, and cover the entire pustule. It will **swell immediately**, and **pricking the root will cause it to emerge**.

In severe cases, the root may appear within **half a day** or have already dissolved. If pricking fails to extract the root, the condition will still **resolve naturally**; **do not worry**. If the pustule lies **internally**, it will **manifest externally as swelling**, accompanied by **persistent cold and heat symptoms**.

If one suspects a **pustule** but it remains unseen, mix **five doses of medicine the size of *tóng* seeds** with **half a bowl of water** and administer **three times daily**. The swelling will **dissolve on its own**. If the root must emerge, take the medicine for **one day**, then **use a chicken feather to induce vomiting**, and the root will come out with the vomit. If the root does not emerge, the medicine will still **dissolve the swelling**.

For **external pustules**, apply the medicine **three times daily**. Once the root emerges, **continue applying the medicine regularly** until **fresh tissue forms** and the condition heals. If **precautions are violated** and symptoms worsen, decoct **three *shēng* of Lycium root and bark** with **five *shēng* of water**, reducing to **two *shēng* of liquid**. Remove the dregs, grind **one *qiǎn* spoonful of medicine** into powder, and mix with **one bowl of Lycium juice**. Take **two to three times daily**, or **preferably drink only Lycium juice** for even better results.

Alternatively, mix **Lycium juice with fresh white dog dung**, and take the liquid—**this is even more effective**.

「Mix thoroughly and apply immediately, without waiting for it to dry.

The **white dog dung** mentioned refers to the dung of dogs that eat bones—its color resembles **quicklime**, hence it is simply called *white dog dung*. If preparing in advance, collect it on the **5th day of the 5th month, 7th day of the 7th month, 9th day of the 9th month, or the 12th month’s *là* day** (i.e., the winter solstice), as these are particularly potent and efficacious.

If someone suddenly experiences **throat pain**, alternating between **chills and heat**, this is the disease, and the remedy should be applied **urgently**. If throat pain arises **without apparent cause**, accompanied by **aversion to cold and fever**, it is also this disease—simply follow the previous method, and recovery will be swift.

Both the earlier and current prescriptions employ the same principle, with identical application, and are **highly effective** for **boils and abscesses**.

For **Ding’s swelling** (a severe throat abscess), **avoid exposure to hemp plants or *má bó* (Cannabis sativa)**, as seeing them may prove fatal. The formula:
**Sesame (胡麻), candle wick residue (烛烬), and sand spicules (针沙), each in equal parts.**
Take the three ingredients, grind into powder, mix with **vinegar**, and apply.

Alternatively:
**Quicklime (石灰) three parts, and horse-hoof tea (马齿菜) two parts.**
Pound the two ingredients, mix with **raw egg white**, and apply.

Another method:
**Pierce the four sides and center of the swelling**, then **dust with male sulfur (雄黄) powder**, and it will **heal immediately**—this is miraculously effective.
One account suggests **dusting with yellow soil (黄土)** instead.

Yet another method:」

「For **Ding’s swelling** (a severe throat abscess), another method:
Take **freshly dug earth from a new mouse burrow** (鼠新室土), mix with **child’s urine** (小儿尿), and apply.

Another method:
Grind **iron rust** (铁衣) into powder, mix with **human breast milk** (人乳汁), and apply—it will heal immediately.

Another method:
Grind **mung bean flowers** (小豆花) into powder and apply—it will heal.

Another method:
Apply **the tip of human feces** (人屎尖)—it will heal immediately.

Another method:
Place **one pill of Sìshén Dān** (四神丹) on the patient’s forehead; after a night, the root will emerge.

For **all cases of Ding’s swelling**:
Take **Xīnglǎo (Xanthium)** (苍耳) root, stem, sprouts, and seeds, burn them to ash until they turn a single color, mix with **vinegar dregs and fermented soybean residue** (醋泔淀) into a paste, and apply. Once dry, reapply. The root will be extracted within ten days—this method is highly effective.

During my four years of **orthodox Daoist practice** (正观), I suddenly developed **Ding’s swelling** on my cheek. I sought **Gānzǐ Zhèn’s** (甘子振) mother for a poultice, but after ten days it did not heal. I then applied this formula and recovered. Later, I often used this remedy to treat others, and none failed to heal. Thus, I record it specially to pass it down.

There are **thousands of formulas for Ding’s swelling**, but none surpass this one. Even the **Qízhōu Rónglǎo’s formula** (齐州荣姥方) cannot rival it. This remedy is simple and easily obtained.

Another method:
Drink **iron vinegar** (铁浆) in a measure of **one *dǒu* (≈10 liters)** (一斗)—it will heal immediately.

Another method:
Mix **fermented grain** (曲) with **pork fat from the 12th lunar month (Làyuè)** (腊月堵脂), seal it over the swelling—it will heal.

Another method:
Burn **one *shēng* (≈100 ml)** (一升) of **cocklebur seeds** (蒺藜子), grind to ash, mix with **strong vinegar** (酽醋), and seal it over the swelling. After a night, it will heal. If the swelling is pierced first, the effect is even better.

Another method:
Grind **soapberry seeds** (皂荚子) to extract the kernel, apply as powder—it will heal within five days.

**Han Guang’s formula from Yùshān** (玉山韩光方): Han Guang treated cases of **Ding’s swelling**. During my **orthodox Daoist practice** (正观), **Xú Shǐjūn from Qúzhōu** (衢州徐使君) found this formula for me:
Take **one担 (≈50 kg)** of **mugwort and artemisia** (艾蒿), burn to ash, and extract the juice in a bamboo tube. Mix with **stone lime** (石灰) like iron vinegar in a ratio of **1:2** (一二合). Pierce the swelling with a needle until it hurts, then apply the mixture three times. The root will emerge on its own—this is a miraculously effective method. I have used this formula to treat over thirty people with success, hence I record it.

**Yúqǐ Ding’s swelling** (鱼脐丁疮) resembles a **fresh needle prick** (似新火针疮), with its edges red and center black. It can be pierced with a needle. If it does not cause severe pain upon piercing, it is fatal to treat. The remedy:
Take **ash from fish heads in the 12th lunar month** (腊月鱼头灰) and **human hair ash** (发灰), each in equal parts, mix with **fermented egg yolk and human feces** (鸡溏屎), and apply. This swelling is highly lethal upon sight.

The *Wàitái* (外台) text omits **human hair ash** (发灰), using **egg white** (鸡子清) instead for mixing and application.

Another method:
Apply **sweetened glutinous rice balls from the Cold Food Festival** (寒食饧)—this is highly effective.

For **hardened swellings**, burn to ash and apply as a poultice—it will heal.

For **Yúqǐ Ding’s swelling** (鱼脐丁疮), where the head is white and swollen, causing unbearable pain:
First, pierce the swelling’s four sides to create holes. Pound **white celery root** (白苣) to extract its juice, and drip it into the needle holes.

Another method:
Apply **feces of the water otter** (水獭屎)—this is highly effective.

For **Ding’s swelling with red roots** (赤根丁):
Take **white powder** (白粉), char it until blackened, mix with **honey** (蜜), and transmit it (as an oral remedy)—this is effective.

Another method:
Take **freshly dug earth from a mouse burrow** (新坌鼠壤), mix with water, and apply. Reapply when it cools.

Another method:
Pound **horse teeth** (马牙齿) into powder, mix with **pork fat from the 12th lunar month** (腊月猪脂), and apply—it will extract the root. Burning to ash and applying is also effective.

For **Ding’s swelling that has turned malignant** (犯丁疮):
**Turnip root** (芜菁根) and **iron rust** (铁生衣), each in equal parts.
Take the two ingredients, mix and pound them. Pierce the swelling with a large needle to create holes. Then, cut **turnip root** into needle-sized strips, apply **iron rust** to them, and insert into the needle holes. Next, apply the previously pounded mixture and seal it. Finally, use a **small square of red cloth** (方寸匕绯帛) to cover and bind it. If pus emerges, reapply. In moments, the root will be extracted, and the swelling will heal immediately.
**Avoid oily, greasy, raw cold, vinegary, spicy, or foul-smelling foods.**

Another method:
Pierce the swelling’s head and four sides, allowing the juice to flow freely. Pound **raw chestnut** (生栗) into powder, apply it, and surround with **fermented grain** (曲), ensuring the chestnut does not spill out. By midday, the root will be extracted.

Another method:
Surround the swelling with **fermented grain** (曲) as in the previous method. Pierce the swelling chaotically with a needle. Boil **vinegar in a copper vessel** until it reaches a rolling boil, and pour it into the fermented grain surrounding the swelling, filling it to **one *shǎo* (≈100 ml)** (一盏). Reapply when it cools. After three applications, the root will emerge.

Another method:
Take **a snake’s shed skin** (蛇蜕皮) the size of an **egg** (如鸡子大), boil in **four *shēng* (≈1.6 liters)** (四升) of water for **three to four boils** (三四沸), strain, and drink the decoction immediately—it will heal immediately.

Another method:
Burn **snake’s shed skin** (蛇蜕皮) to ash, mix with **egg white** (鸡子清), and apply—it will heal.

Another method:
Take **Xīnglǎo (Xanthium) sprouts** (苍耳苗), pound to extract the juice—**one to two *shēng* (≈100-200 ml)** (一二升)—and drink it. Apply the residue to the swelling—it will heal immediately.

Another method:
**Moxibustion** (灸) the **horizontal crease on the back of the hand** (掌后横纹) behind the **five fingers** (五指), **left hand for men, right hand for women** (男左女右), with **seven sessions** (七壮)—it will heal. This method has proven effective.

Though there are many **moxibustion methods for Ding’s swelling**, this one is particularly effective and surpasses expectations.

**Prescriptions for Carbuncles and Abscesses (痈疽方)**

**Section on Pulses (第二脉)**
**Discussion (论)**
**Prescriptions (方)**
**Prohibitions (禁法)**
**Moxibustion Methods (灸法)**

**Pulse Diagnostics:**
If the pulse is **floating and rapid** (浮数脉) but the body shows no heat, it indicates an **internal carbuncle** (痈). All floating and rapid pulses should cause fever, yet if the patient instead feels **chilly and aversion to cold** (洗洗恶寒) and complains of localized pain, it will soon **congeal into a carbuncle** (结为痈).

If the pulse is **weak and slow** (微而迟), fever will develop. If it is **weak and rapid** (弱而数), it signifies **shivering** (振寒) and will lead to **carbuncle and swelling** (痈肿).

If the pulse is **floating and rapid** (浮而数) with no bodily heat, the patient’s demeanor grows **listless** (默默), the stomach feels **slightly parched** (微燥), and they may not yet feel pain—yet they will soon develop **carbuncle and swelling**.

If the pulse is **slippery and rapid** (滑而数), slipperiness indicates **repletion** (实), rapidity indicates **heat** (热). Slipperiness corresponds to the **Nutritive Qi** (荣), rapidity to the **Defensive Qi** (卫). When Nutritive and Defensive Qi converge, it **congeals into a carbuncle** (结为痈). Wherever heat passes, **pus forms** (痈脓).

If the body has a **painful area** (痛处) and **ulcers recur** (苦有疮), it is a sign of impending carbuncle.

**Q:** *If the pulse at the **Cun position** (寸口) is **weak and rough** (微而涩), the standard prognosis is blood loss or sweating. What if sweating does not occur?*
**A:** *If the body has ulcers or wounds from blades or tools, it is due to **blood loss** (亡血).*

If the **Yin Spring pulse** (趺阳脉) is **slippery and rapid**, it indicates **diarrhea** (下重).

If the **Minor Yin pulse** (少阴脉) is **slippery and rapid**, a woman will develop **ulcers in the genital region** (阴中生疮).

**Discussion:**
When a carbuncle or abscess first appears, its onset is often **subtle**, and people rarely regard it as urgent. Yet this is a **grave affliction**; swift treatment is essential. Delay leads to **established disease**, and many disasters arise from hesitation.

If the carbuncle appears on the **back** (发背), if the skin is **thin**, it is called **carbuncle** (痈); if the skin is **thick**, it is called **abscess** (疽). **Urgent treatment is required.**

When a carbuncle or abscess first emerges, it may resemble a **small mole** (小廊), or cause **severe pain** (大痛) or **mild pain** (小痛). Sometimes it appears as a **white pus-filled grain** (米粒大白脓子)—these are **early signs** (微候). If even slight changes occur, **immediate alarm is needed**. Attack with **therapeutics and dietary restrictions**, administer **decoctions to purge heat-toxins** (下去热毒). If no medicine is available, **moxibustion at the crown** (当头百壮) is required.

For severe cases, moxibustion should be applied to **all four sides and the center** (四面及中央), **200–300 moxa cones** (二三百壮). Frequent moxibustion is unnecessary—**apply thin layers of cooling herbs** (薄以冷药) afterward.

**All救疗 methods must be swift to achieve cure** (必速瘥).

When applying **medicated plasters** (药帖), place them over the **carbuncle’s head** (疮头). The plaster should have **ventilation holes** (开孔) to **release heat** (泄热气).

Alternatively, **pierce the carbuncle with a fire-needle** (火针) to a depth of **four fen** (四分)—this ensures cure.

**Never** use acupuncture or **bloodletting** (针角) on **carbuncles, abscesses, tumors, calcified carbuncles, tendon knots, or scrofula** (痈、疽、瘤、石痈、结筋、瘰疬)—**even slight misapplication risks disaster** (少有不及祸).

For **any carbuncle**, regardless of size, once detected, **cut a piece of glue** (胶) the size of a **palm**, soften it in **warm water** (暖水), and mold it into a thin sheet. Punch a **coin-sized hole** (如钱孔大) over the carbuncle’s center. Apply it to the swelling—it will **dry quickly**. If no pus has formed, the carbuncle **will not worsen**. If pus has formed, it **will drain naturally**. If a **sharp needle** (锋针) is inserted through the hole to **draw pus**, it is ideal. Remove the glue once the carbuncle heals.

**Swelling classifications:**
- If the **base is less than one inch wide**, it is a **furuncle** (疖).
- If the **base is over one inch**, it is a **small carbuncle** (小痈).
- If it resembles a **pea-sized blister** (豆粒大), it is a **vesicle** (疱子).

**Immediate treatment:** Administer **Five-Spice Forsythia Decoction** (五香连翘汤) to purge heat-toxins. Use **multiple doses until cured**.

For carbuncles that are **elevated, smooth, and large** (高而光大) with **no excessive heat**, if the flesh is **level and purple** (正平无尖而紫), **do not lance them**—instead, prescribe **Bamboo Leaf Astragalus Decoction** (竹叶黄耆汤) to **regulate the Qi** (申其气). A **flat, purple surface indicates no pus** (无脓).

If a carbuncle **suddenly becomes painful**, apply **Eight-Flavor Astragalus Powder** (八味黄耆散). For **large carbuncles**, apply for **seven days**; for **small ones**, **five days**. If the carbuncle is **firm and resistant**, it **must rupture naturally** (宁生破).

If **milk-like discharge or heat** appears and the hand **cannot approach**, first administer **King-of-the-Vines Powder** (王不留行散) internally and **apply Breaking-the-Back Ointment** (发背膏) externally.

If the **back ulcer ruptures without pain**, and the carbuncle is on the **breast**, ensure it is **fully mature** (极熟). When pressing it **follows the hand’s movement** (随手即起), the ulcer is **ready for lancing** (疮熟). **Needle swiftly**, aiming for pus—**adjust depth intuitively** (以意消息). The needle should not penetrate **more than one inch** into the chest or back.

If **no pus is found**, apply **Meat-Eating Ointment** (食肉膏散) to the **carbuncle’s opening** (着兑头) and insert it into the **carbuncle’s cavity** (内痈口中). If the **body’s heat subsides**, administer **Mulberry Leaf Powder** (木占斯散).

After **five days**, if the carbuncle is **forming a scab** (欲着痂), prescribe **Pus-Draining Internal Plug Powder** (排脓内塞散).

After a carbuncle **ruptures**, the patient may feel **weak and near death**, with **internal cold and external heat** (内寒外热). Some swellings **resemble carbuncles but are not**—press the swelling: if it **does not connect to deeper tissues**, it is **wind-toxin** (风毒). **Do not lance it**; instead, administer **Cangzhu Decoction** (升麻汤) and apply **Cangzhu Ointment** (摩升麻膏). When lancing, leave **three fen at the top** and **one fen at the bottom**—ensure the area is **extremely hot** (极热), which **relieves pain**.

If the carbuncle **decays without healing**, wash it with **Pig’s Hoof Decoction** (猪蹄汤), **twice daily**. In summer, **two days** suffice; in winter, **six or seven days**. Even **half a dose** may help.

If **necrotic flesh** remains after decay, wash with **Pig’s Hoof Decoction** to remove impurities, then apply **Meat-Eating Ointment** (食肉膏散). Once all **necrotic tissue is gone**, apply **Fresh Meat Ointment** (生肉膏散) and **rub the edges** (摩四边) to **promote healthy tissue growth**.

**Avoid sexual activity**, **guard against wind and cold**, and **prevent overexertion**. Only when **tendons and vessels recover** may normal activities resume.

**New flesh is fragile**—if injured, it **may ulcerate again**, leading to **recurrence**, which is **difficult to treat**. **Exercise utmost caution**, especially with **white scabs** (白痂).

For **all sudden swellings**, regardless of location, administer **Five-Spice Forsythia Decoction** (五香连翘汤), **lance to bleed**, and apply **mung bean powder** (小豆末). **Frequently lance to bleed** between doses.

If treatment is **delayed and ulceration occurs**, continue with **Five-Spice Decoction** and **Drainage Decoction** (漏芦汤), adjusting the dose based on **heat severity**. Externally, apply **Cangzhu Decoction** (升麻汤) to **wash and warm** the area. *(See section on **Danpox** (丹毒) for **Cangzhu Ointment** (摩升麻膏).)*

If **fleshy polyps** arise, apply **White Simplified Poria Powder** (白简茹散) until all **greenish-black necrotic flesh** is gone, then cease. Once **healthy flesh regenerates**, apply **Cangzhu Ointment** (升麻膏). If **no new flesh forms**, apply **One-Ingredient Astragalus Powder** (一物黄耆散). Should **White Simplified Poria Powder** fail to remove all **greenish-black malignant flesh**, mix **half a *cash* of Lacquered Poria Powder** (漆头茹散) with **three *cash* of White Simplified Poria Powder**, applying gradually. Each powder must be **ground separately by color**, sifted, and used as-is.

These methods are recorded in *Ji Yan* (《集验》) for treating **slow abscesses**.

Sometimes, **sudden localized pain** occurs—like after a blow—known as **Qi Pain** (气痛). The pain is **unbearable**, **wandering and relentless**, flaring at intervals. When it strikes, **mild fever** follows; when it subsides, **chill** ensues. This stems from **winter exposure to warm *qi*** (温气), followed by **spring’s sudden cold**, where **wind disrupts** it, preventing **warm disease** and instead causing **Qi Pain**. Treat first with **Five-Spice Forsythia Decoction** (五香连翘汤), apply **Dan Shēn Ointment** (摩丹参膏), and **warm-compress with wine-cooked willow bark**. If **red *qi* spots** appear, **lance to bleed**.

Continue with **Five-Spice Forsythia Decoction** and **Small Bamboo Juice Decoction** (小竹沥汤) for **multiple doses**—do not cease after one dose if no immediate relief, lest disaster follow. **White Wei Powder** (白薇散) is also beneficial mid-treatment.

For **Qi-induced swelling and pain**, resembling **abscesses but without a head**, **hollow swelling with unchanged skin color**, yet **tight skin and unbearable pain preventing touch**, again administer **Five-Spice Decoction**, followed by **White Needle Drainage** (白针泻), then apply **Spiny Cocklebur Powder** (蒺藜散).

If **chest pain** accompanies **shortness of breath**, enter a **dark room**, press your fingers on the **left eye**—if light appears, a **hidden abscess** lurks in the chest; if no light, the **disease has erupted internally as a carbuncle**. The *Classics* state:
*"When *qi* stagnates in the meridians, both *qi* and blood congeal, clotting into abscesses and carbuncles."* It does not specify **heat’s role**, yet later, **heat forms abscesses**. Further, **yang *qi* gathering** turns **cold into heat**, and **excessive heat rots flesh into pus**. When **body heat clashes with cold**, **pulse congeals and stagnates**, with **heat *qi* clotting into abscesses and carbuncles**.

Treatment may involve **moxibustion** or **warming therapy** for **early cold stages**, or **cooling herbs** for **established heat** to prevent suppuration. For **red, pointed swellings**, apply **Prickly Ash Ointment** (藜芦膏). Alternatively, **mix vinegar with crushed clam-shell ash**, reapplying when dry.

From my own experience, **abscesses and carbuncles** often stem from **medicinal *qi*** or **ancestral ingestion of minerals**, passing to descendants. **Dietarily**, avoid **fermented grains, alcohol, garlic**, and **overly warm beds or thick blankets**. Those who heed these precautions may **avoid such ailments lifelong**. These insights come from **personal verification**, hence their inclusion.

**Vincetoxicum Powder** (王不留行散)
*For stubborn, non-draining abscesses:*
**Vincetoxicum Seed** (王不留行子) – 3 *ge* (*Qiān Jīn Yì* uses 1 *sheng*)
**Dragon Bone** (龙骨) – 2 *liang*

---
**Internal Supplement Powder** (内补散)
*For abscesses, carbuncles, breast abscesses in women, and unruptured boils:*
**Wood Occupy** (木占斯) – 1 *liang*
**Ginseng** (人参) – 1 *liang*
**Dried Ginger** (*or* **Rehmannia Root**) (乾姜/乾地黄) – 1 *liang*
**Cinnamon Bark** (桂心) – 1 *liang*
**Asarum** (细辛) – 1 *liang*
**Thick-Shell Bitter Orange** (厚朴) – 1 *liang*
**Fermented Safflower** (败酱防风) – 1 *liang*
**Trichosanthes Root** (栝蒌根) – 1 *liang*
**Platycodon Root** (桔梗) – 1 *liang*
**Licorice** (甘草) – 1 *liang*

「The following eleven ingredients treat **lower sores** (下筛): **Wood Occupy** (木占斯), **Ginseng** (人参), **Dried Ginger** (乾姜), **Cinnamon Bark** (桂心), **Asarum** (细辛), **Thick-Shell Bitter Orange** (厚朴), **Fermented Safflower** (败酱防风), **Trichosanthes Root** (栝蒌根), **Platycodon Root** (桔梗), **Licorice** (甘草), each 1 *liang*.
Take with wine, one **square-cubed spoonful** (方寸匕), until the medicine flows into the sore. For **carbuncles and abscesses** (痈疽) where moxibustion fails to rupture them, this remedy may be taken. If the abscess is unruptured, omit **Fermented Safflower**; if pus has already formed, include it. Take the medicine seven or eight times daily and two or three times at night—more frequent use is preferable. If the illness is in the lower body and **pus and blood** (脓血) are expected, this is **intestinal carbuncle** (肠痈). For all diseases affecting the lower region, take this medicine alone, and its efficacy will be felt: pain will cease, and prolonged use will harmonize all sores and **abscesses, hemorrhoids, and fistulas** (疽痔). If the wound has already ruptured, healing will be swift. Physicians unaware of this remedy have no cure for **unruptured abscesses** (发背). If a patient feels discomfort on the back and **thirst** (渴), it indicates the abscess is not yet resolved—take the medicine diligently. Once the medicine takes effect, the thirst will subside, and the swelling will dissipate. Even if the abscess has already ruptured, continue taking the medicine without interruption; the swelling will gradually vanish without notice. For long-term use, **Fermented Safflower** should be omitted. Women with **breast abscesses** (乳痈) should take it promptly.

Another formula, lacking **Cinnamon Bark**, is called **Wood Occupy Powder** (木占斯散), which treats **hard, stubborn abscesses and swellings** (痈肿坚结). If the abscess has already ruptured, healing will be rapid; if unruptured, it will prevent formation and dissolve the swelling. **Zhang Wenzhong** omitted **Cinnamon Bark**, while **Liu Xunzi** stated this is **Hua Tuo’s** formula.

**Pus-Draining Internal Plug Powder** (排脓内塞散), for **large sores** (大疮) where fever has subsided but **pus and blood** (脓血) persist, and where the wound is hollow with lingering pain:

These fourteen ingredients treat **lower sores** (下筛); take with wine, one **square-cubed spoonful** (方寸匕), three times daily and once at night.

Discard the dregs, and wash the wound for about half an hour. Dry with cloth, then apply **fresh meat paste** (生肉膏) once daily. If pain persists, add **Angelica** (当归) and **Licorice** (甘草), each 2 *liang*.

Another formula treats **carbuncles and abscesses** (痈疽) spreading to all ten fingers, or rising from the **bladder** (膀胱), or generating **malignant flesh** (恶肉) after **unruptured abscesses** (发背):

These eight ingredients, chopped, are simmered in 3 *dou* of water until the hoof is cooked. Take 8 *sheng*, strain, then add the medicines and reduce to 4 *sheng*. Discard the dregs, and soak the wound for two meals’ duration. Wash it, dry thoroughly, and apply **Musk Paste** (麝香膏).

**Paste for Malignant Flesh** (食恶肉膏):
**Rhubarb** (大黄), **Ligusticum Root** (芎藭), **Imperata Rhizome** (莽草), **Margarita Pearl** (真珠), **Orpiment** (雌黄), **Aconite** (附子, raw), each 1 *liang*; **White Lead** (白敛), **Alum** (矾石), **Scutellaria Root** (黄苓), **Margarita Pearl** (真珠), **Realgar** (雄黄), each 2 *liang*.

Discard the dregs, then mix in **Margarita Pearl** (真珠) and **Alum** (矾石) powder, stirring well before applying to the wound. The **malignant flesh** (恶肉) will cease entirely.

For **abscesses and swellings** (痈肿) where **malignant flesh** (恶肉) persists:
**Caltrop Fruit** (蒴藋灰) or **Caltrop Ash** (藋灰), **Lime Ash** (石灰, or **white charcoal ash** (白炭灰) in *Zhǒuhòu* [肘后]).
Take the juice from each, combine, and simmer into a paste. Apply to the wound; the **malignant flesh** (恶肉) will stop, and **black moles** (黑子) will also be removed.
This remedy loses efficacy after ten days.

Another formula: Simmer **raw Rehmannia Root juice** (生地黄汁) into a **glue-like consistency** (如胶), shape into **pills** (饼子), and apply four or five times daily.

These eight ingredients are ground into powder and applied to **malignant flesh** (恶肉) for it to be sucked away. The *Qian Jin Yi* (《千金翼》) section on **thin applications** (薄帖篇) omits **White Alum** (白矾) and **Orpiment** (雌黄), instead including **Puncturevine** (藜芦), stating it may also be mixed into a paste and applied.

Another formula:

**Fresh Rehmannia Root** (生地黄) in varying amounts, pounded and pressed three times, with the juice extracted. Boiled in a copper vessel with water, uncovered to allow **qi** (气) to disperse, reduced to half. Strained through cloth to remove coarse, clotted, and turbid residues, then decocted again until it thickens like **molasses** (饧).

All swellings that reach hardness with a root are called *shíyīng* (石痈, lit. "stone abscess").

**Method to Prevent Swellings:**
At the beginning of spring, when the first thunder sounds, quickly press two fingers to the thunder’s source. Cease when the sound stops. For the next seven days, do not wash your hands. Thereafter, if you encounter any swelling—whether from *yìshuì* (蜴螫, lit. "lizard bites") or malignant abscesses—rubbing them with your fingers will cause them to dissolve instantly.

**Prescription for Marking Swellings:**
*Tiān* (天) **#17** *Yǐ* (乙) *Jiǎ* (甲) **#1** (一) *bùshēng* (不生) **#2** *Yǐ* (乙) *bùchéng* (不成), *Rén* (壬) *Guǐ* (癸) *sǐ* (死) **#3** (右)
Use cinnabar to mark the swelling, then hold your breath and mark it again—it will immediately heal.

**Prescription for Malignant Toxic Swellings:**
If the swelling is excruciating, drawing inward to the lower abdomen, or if it appears on the scrotum or one side, causing unbearable pain and cramping—this will kill a person within one night:
Take **fennel (*huíxiāng* 茴香) grass**, crush it into juice, and drink **one *shēng* (升)** daily, three or four times. Apply the residue to the swelling.
In winter months, if it is not yet alive, the root can also be used.
This is a divine foreign prescription, first employed in the last year of **Yǒngjiā** (永嘉) era. It has miraculous efficacy in reviving the dead.

**Prescription for Wind-Labor Toxic Swellings:**
If the swelling causes excruciating pain, cramping, or draws inward to the lower abdomen and waist, causing spleen pain:
Use **one *shēng* (升) of *peach kernels (*táorén* 桃仁)***, processed as usual, mixed with **three *shēng* (升) of wine, and taken in one dose. Wrap yourself in thick clothing and induce sweating—no more than three doses will heal.

**Prescription for Leg Swellings Rising to the Abdomen (Fatal):**
Use **one *dǒu* (斗) of *red adzuki beans (*chìxiǎodòu* 赤小豆)***, boiled in **three *dǒu* (斗) of water until soft. Drain the beans and soak the legs in the broth up to the knees daily—once, until healed.
If the swelling has already entered the abdomen, do not soak—simply boil and eat the beans.
Avoid **salt, vegetables, rice, and *qū* (曲, malt/fermented grains)***.
Drink the broth when thirsty—cease when healed.

**Fennel and Adzuki Broth:**
For **poisonous swellings** with no fixed location, or those with **redness and malignant cold**, or those causing **piercing abdominal pain and restlessness**—this is due to deep-seated **poisonous *qi* (*dúqì* 毒气)**:
**Fennel (*huíxiāng* 茴香) – five *shēng* (升)**
**Red adzuki beans (*chìxiǎodòu* 赤小豆) – five *shēng* (升)**

**Prepared *shègān* (*shègān* 射干, lit. "belamcanda") – three *liǎng* (两)**
**Prepared *shēngmá* (*shēngmá* 升麻, lit. "stemona") – four *liǎng* (两)**
The six substances above, **#4** (□) chopped, are boiled in **four *dǒu* (斗) of water. First, boil the first four ingredients, reducing to **two and a half *dǒu* (斗)**, then discard the dregs. Next, crush the **fennel seeds (*mázi* 麻子)** into fragments, mix with the broth, and boil once more. Strain and discard the residue. Use the broth to cook the **adzuki beans** until soft.
Take **five *hé* (合)** of the broth per dose, **two times daily and once at night**.

From *Na Sūn Zhēnrén Bèijí Qiānjīn Yàofāng*, Volume 67, edited by *Sòng Cháo Fèngláng Shǒu Tàicháng Shàoqīng Chōng Mìgé Jiàolǐ Lín Yì* et al.

**Prescription #1: *Fàbèi* (发背) – Third Theory on *Fàbèi***

**Theory:**
All cases of *fàbèi* arise from ingesting the Five Stones (五石), cold foods, or *Gēngshēngsǎn* (更生散). Some occur from consuming *zhōngrǔ* (钟乳, stalactite) alone, while others manifest spontaneously in those who have never ingested such substances—these are remnants of past consumption. Typically, the condition first appears between the shoulder blades as a grain-sized lump, either painful or itchy, with a reddish hue. Patients often dismiss it initially, but within ten days, it grows to three *cùn* wide and one *cùn* high, forming dozens of pus-filled orifices. Pressing it causes pus to discharge, and soon the patient loses their voice. Those who practice *yǎngshēng* (养生, life-nurturing) must act swiftly: upon sensing unusual itching or pain on the back, they should immediately prepare clean soil mixed with water into a paste, shaping it into a plaque—two *fèn* thick and one-and-a-half *cùn* wide. Using coarse mugwort (*ài* 艾) as an incense stick, they cauterize the plaque placed over the sore, replacing it after each stick. If the lump is grain-sized, seven plaques suffice for recovery; if the size of an elm fruit (*yújiá* 榆荚), seventy-seven plaques are needed; if coin-sized, cauterize continuously day and night without limit. Concurrently, administer *Wǔxiāng Liánqiáo Tāng* (五香连翘汤) and *tiějiāng* (铁浆, iron decoction) to purge the condition, ensuring full recovery.

**Alternative Method:**
Before *fàbèi* develops into a large abscess, repeatedly drench it with cold water and apply cold compresses of soaked stones day and night until recovery. Patients must avoid wheat flour, alcohol, and the Five Pungent Aromatics (五辛).

Some cases manifest on the shoulders. Those who ingest stones must engage in vigorous physical labor, avoiding comfort. Failure to do so often triggers the condition. They must also resist excessive warmth, denying personal comfort to endure cold—though initially uncomfortable, this prevents future outbreaks.

When a swelling arises between the shoulder blades, white like millet or sorghum, spreading with red-black edges and causing dizziness, it is *fàbèi*. Abstain from sexual activity, alcohol, meat, and garlic-flour mixtures. If untreated, it invades internally and proves fatal. Cauterization requires seven to eight hundred applications over the sore. Many misdiagnose it as a general swelling and die as a result.

---
**Prescription for Treating *Fàbèi* and Abscesses (Whether Ruptured or Not):**
Take *xiāngchǐ* (香豉, fragrant fermented soybeans), three *shēng*, mix with minimal water, and pound into a thick paste. Shape into plaques (three *fèn* thick or more) over the swelling, avoiding existing orifices. Place the soybean paste plaque and arrange mugwort above for cauterization, ensuring warmth without burning the flesh. If pain or heat arises, replace immediately. The condition should improve. Once stable, cauterize twice daily. If pus drains from existing orifices, recovery follows.

---
**Prescription for Treating Ruptured or Unruptured *Fàbèi*, Abscesses, and Toxic Swellings:**
**Gūlǔ gēn** (枯篓根, dried *Luffa* root)
**Yúbáipí** (榆白皮, elm bark)
**Húyànkē** (胡燕窠, swallow’s nest)
**Shǔshìtǔ** (鼠室土, rat’s nest soil)

Equal parts. Grind into a powder. Use a woman’s menstrual cloth, washed to extract its juice, and mix with the powder into a paste. Apply over the swelling; replace upon drying. For ruptured cases, seal the edges. Apply daily for one to five days until recovery.

**Fourth Discussion on *Dāndú* [Erythema]:**
*Dāndú* is also called **Tiān Huǒ** (天火, Heavenly Fire). Suddenly, red patches like vermilion appear in the flesh, large ones resembling a hand’s palm, severe cases covering the entire body with itching and swelling, and no fixed color.

There is **Báidān** (白丹, white *dāndú*): red patches rise in the flesh, itching followed by pain, with slight hollow swelling like blown-up skin, and hidden **zhěn** (轸, *dú*-like eruptions).

There is **Jīguān Dān** (鸡冠丹, *dāndú* resembling a rooster’s comb): red patches rise in the flesh, large ones like linked coins, small ones like sesame seeds, with rough texture resembling a rooster’s comb. Also called **Zhūyú Dān** (茱萸丹, cornelian cherry *dāndú*).

There is **Shuǐdān** (水丹, water *dāndú*): caused by whole-body heat, which, when exposed to water or moisture, forms red-yellow patches resembling water trapped in the skin, often appearing on the thighs or groin. Though seemingly minor, if untreated, it can be fatal.

**Treatment:**
All cases use the **Shēngmá Gāo** (升麻膏, *Cimicifuga* plaster) prescription:

**Shēngmá** (升麻, *Cimicifuga*) – 2 *liǎng*
**Báiwěi** (白薇, *Oldenlandia diffusa*) – 2 *liǎng* (*Zhǒuhòu* [Prescriptions from the Armchair] uses **Báiliàn** (白敛, angelica dahurica))

**Liánqiào** (连翘, forsythia) – 2 *liǎng*

Right: ten herbs. Lightly crushed, steeped in three *shēng* of water for half a day, then simmered with five *shēng* of pig fat until the water evaporates. Strain, and apply the fat plaster to the swelling. All types of *dāndú* use this, as well as for heat-induced sores and swellings, three times daily.

The *Jīngxīn Lù* (经心录) omits **zhǐshí** (枳实, immature tangerine), using it instead only for Toxic Swellings.

**Zhīzǐ** (栀子, gardenia) – 20 pieces

Right: six herbs. [Missing character] cut, steeped in one *dǒu* of water for a long time, decocted to reduce to seven *shēng*. Cool, and use an old piece of silk to absorb the juice, applying it to all *dāndú* patches, keeping them moist. After defecation, take **Yīnzǐ Tāng** (饮子, decoction) along with **Lòulú Tāng** (漏芦汤, *Veratrum nigrum* Decoction). This prescription is also found in the earlier section on carbuncles. Taking it will cure *dāndú* immediately.

The *Xiǎopǐn* [Small Classification] uses it to treat **Dānzhěn** (丹轸, *dú*-like eruptions) and Toxic Swellings.

**Single-Herb Prescriptions:**
**Shuǐtái** (水苔, water sedge) – fresh
**Shéxián** (蛇衔, *Achyranthes bidentata*) – fresh
**Shēngdìhuáng** (生地黄, fresh rehmannia) – fresh
**Shēngsōngcài** (生菘菜, fresh leafy greens) – fresh

From the above, take one herb and mix with water to apply.

Right: thirteen herbs. Some are crushed into powder, and one herb is used alone, which will cure immediately. Another prescription:

**On the Coldest Herbs in the World:**
No herb is colder than aquatic greens. For those afflicted with heat-toxins, eruptions, or *dān* (pox), take the aquatic greens from the water, finely chop, and mash while warm to apply. Apply thickly—three *fēn* (分)—and replace once dry.

**Divine-Efficacy Prescription for All Eruptions:**
Take *yúnwēi cài* (芸薹菜, Chinese cabbage) and mash while warm, sealing thickly. It dissolves upon application. If residual heat-qi persists, seal it for three days to fully resolve—even if dry, do not remove, to cut off the root.

In the third month of the seventh year of *Zhèngguān* (正观), on the eighth day, I drank excessively in Nèijiāng County (内江县). By night, I awoke in pain throughout my bones and flesh. By dawn, my head ached, my vision blurred, and a swelling the size of a marble formed at the left corner of my brow—too painful to touch. By noon, it shifted to the right corner, and by night, it spread everywhere, sealing my eyes shut so I could not open them. I nearly perished. The county magistrate, Master Zhōu (周公), treated me with various medicines, but none took effect. After seven days, I applied this prescription myself, and its efficacy was divine. Thus, I record it to pass down to future generations.

**Hidden Itch (隐翰) – Fifth Discussion on Moxibustion Methods**
The *Suwen* (《素问》) states:
*"When wind evil invades the muscles, the muscles become depleted, and true *qi* scatters. If further struck by cold, it seizes the skin, opens the pores, and disrupts the hair follicles, allowing errant *qi* to wander—this gives rise to itch. Thus, wind-induced itching and hidden itch all stem from this."*

There are also cases of *chì hàn* (赤翰), which suddenly appear like mosquito bites, causing intense itching—when scratched, new welts rise in their place.
Similarly, there is *bái zhěn* (白轸), which behaves likewise.
*Chì hàn* erupts when hot and subsides when cool;
*Bái zhěn* appears when the weather is cold and damp.

For *bái zhěn*, boil *fánshí* (矾石) into a decoction and wipe the affected area, or boil *chuìlì* (蒴藋) with a small amount of wine for bathing—excellent, as used by Master Yao (姚氏) for treating *chìzhěn* (赤疹).
Alternatively, boil *shínán* (石南) into a decoction and wipe the area—excellent.
Or boil *jīshǐ* (鸡屎) into a decoction, or boil *jīshí* (枳实) into a decoction and wipe—excellent.

All other cases follow the methods for treating *dān* (丹).
Commonly called *fēngshǐ* (风屎) or *fēngshī* (风尸).

**Stone South Decoction (石南汤)** treats sixty-four kinds of wind disorders:
When *yín yè* (淫液) invades the skin like crawling insects, causing stiffness in the waist and spine, alternating flaccidity and rigidity in the limbs, cramping hands and feet, hidden itch that worsens when scratched into sores, or *fēngshī* (风尸) itch—suddenly swelling of the face, inability to raise the hands to the head, or locked jaw preventing speech—
This decoction should be taken internally for relief.

*From the *Emergency Prescriptions from the Golden Treasury* (备急千金要方) by Sun Simiao (孙真人), Volume 67, concluded.*

**Prescriptions for Carbuncles and Abscesses #1**
**The Sixth Treatise on Carbuncles**

**Discourse on the Prescriptions:**
Carbuncles (*lièjū*) are sudden growths within the flesh resembling pea-sized dots. The smaller ones are like millet grains, while the most severe resemble plums or prunes. They may appear red, black, green, or white, with no fixed form. Though rooted, they do not cause superficial swelling. Pain radiates to the heart, and if the root penetrates deep into the muscles, prolonged illness leads to swelling on all sides. The blister darkens, ripens into a purplish-black hue, and can rot away tendons and bones.

If the poison disperses along the meridians and enters the viscera, it may kill. In the south, this is called *tuōzhuó dú* (毒, "poisonous carbuncle"). For thick-fleshed areas, excise the affected region or cauterize with heated iron until charred like coal. Alternatively, apply moxibustion (up to a hundred cones), or ingest *kuígen* (葵根, *Citrullus colocynthis* root) juice, *lánqīng* (蓝青, *Isatis indigotica*) juice, *xījiǎo* (犀角, rhinoceros horn) juice, *shěngmá* (升麻, *Codonopsis pilosula*) juice, *zhúlì* (竹沥, bamboo sap), or *Huánglóng táng* (黄龙汤) and other single-herb remedies to specifically clear heat and achieve cure.

This malady often affects the fingertips, resembling *dàizhǐ* (代指, "finger substitute disease"). Since people fail to recognize it, they mistakenly call it *dàizhǐ*. If untreated, the poison spreads upward along the meridians into the viscera, killing the patient. In the southern regions, those afflicted often have the finger amputated.

Initially, the fingertip darkens into a blister, then swells red and black. The pain penetrates to the heart. *Dàizhǐ* first swells with heat and pain, without darkening. Pus forms along the nail edge, and in severe cases, the nail falls off—this is called *dàizhǐ* disease. Applying any cold medicinal juice to wash and soak it is ideal.

If heat is excessive, administer *Lòulú táng* (漏芦汤) and soak the area. Applying *Shěngmá gāo* (升麻膏, *Codonopsis pilosula* paste) is also effective. Bloodletting with needles is permissible, followed by washing, soaking, and applying the paste.

There are also cases of *èròu* (malignant flesh) disease, where flesh suddenly appears on the body like red bean seeds, protruding and growing rapidly. When pressed, it secretes a fluid like cow or horse milk, forming a crest-like shape atop. If left untreated, it grows uncontrollably without pain or itching. This arises from exposure to noxious winds in spring and winter, which penetrate the muscles and meridians, transforming into this ailment.

Treatment requires ingesting *Lòulú táng* (漏芦汤) and cauterizing the area with heated iron until it chars completely. Then, apply *Shěngmá gāo* (升麻膏) repeatedly until the condition resolves.

There is also *chìmài* (red vein) disease, where red vascular networks suddenly rise on the body, swelling like dead earthworms, appearing as if water fills the veins. Their length follows the meridians. This stems from exposure to noxious winds in spring and winter, causing blood and flesh stagnation in the collaterals.

Treatment involves *Wǔxiāng Liánqiāo táng* (五香连翘汤) and *zhúlì* (竹沥, bamboo sap), along with bloodletting. Apply *Dānshēn gāo* (丹参膏) or white chicken dung paste for efficacy.

In cases of *èhé* (malignant nodules), flesh suddenly develops nodules like plum or cherry pits, or smaller ones like beans. The skin and flesh ache, with intense fever, constipation, and aversion to cold—similar to other ulcerous growths and lymph node swellings. Such growths from ulcers are slow and non-toxic, whereas *èhé* emerges abruptly, is toxic, and if untreated, invades the abdomen, causing agitation and death.

This arises from exposure to warm winds in winter, followed by sudden cold in spring and summer, causing *qi* stagnation and toxin formation. Treatment requires *Wǔxiāng táng* (五香汤), small red bean powder applied topically, or decoction soaking. Wash frequently, then apply *Dānshēn gāo* until the nodules dissolve.

Initially, *èhé* resembles *shègōng dú* (poison from arrow wounds), appearing without a fixed location, often causing intermittent, dull pain. If pain is absent, one may neglect treatment, leading to delayed intervention and fatal consequences. Thus, early prevention is crucial. Strictly avoid fish, chicken, pork, beef, horse, and donkey meat.

Early symptoms resemble millet grains or sesame seeds, embedded in the flesh like hardened blisters, growing rapidly. Initially, chills dominate, followed swiftly by shortness of breath. Grind *hào zhūyú* (昊茱萸) five *hè* (合) into powder, mix with one *shēng* (升) of water, strain, and ingest immediately. Apply the residue topically, repeating the decoction to disperse the toxin before it invades the abdomen—failure to do so invites disaster.

For *tòngbìng* (painful vein disease), pain often manifests in the limbs, with red veins rising like twisted ropes, accompanied by acute pain and fever. When affecting the feet, it ascends from the calf to the ankle, also resembling twisted ropes. When affecting the kidneys, it settles beneath the armpits.

This arises from prolonged exertion with excessive heat, later assaulted by dampness or cold, causing *qi* stagnation in the tendons. If untreated, it may ulcerate and form pus, leading to tendon contraction. If unresolved, lingering heat may trigger *tòngbìng*, treatable with *Lòulú táng*. After purging, use a *fēngzhēn* (锋针) to drain stagnant blood and *qi* from the root. Apply small red bean powder to dissolve the nodules. Alternatively, use *zhì dān fǎ* (治丹法) or *zhì yōng sānmèi gāncǎo sǎn* (治痈三味甘草散) topically. If ulcerated, treat as for *yōng* (痈, abscess).

*Èhé*, *tòngbìng*, and *bìojú* (瘭疽, carbuncles) frequently afflict southern regions, rarely seen in central plains. Southern diets, diverse and abundant, yield varied ailments. Officials traveling there must take precautions—neglect invites poisoning. Essential remedies include *Wǔxiāng táng*, small red bean powder, and *wú zhūyú* (吴茱萸).

In cases of *fùgǔjū* (attached-bone carbuncle), the lesion adheres to bone without rupture, forming pus beneath the skin, hence the name. It often affects major joints, appearing in men’s groins and women’s postpartum regions, or on children’s backs. In adults, sudden onset causes severe pain, restricting movement. Pressure reveals bone pain, followed by gradual skin tightening and swelling like fatty tissue.

In infants, proximity to the hands triggers loud crying—a sign of joint pain. Slow-onset cases in adults begin with a warm sensation in the muscles, progressing to painful stiffness. Infants’ limbs become immobile, appearing rigid. If joints swell without recognition as *fùgǔjū*, the body may become universally swollen, turning bluish-black without ulceration. Misdiagnosed as *zéifēng fēngzhǒng* (贼风风肿), it remains unidentified as a carbuncle.

When the body overheats and encounters wind while cooling, wind and heat clash in the bone joints, forming *fùgǔjū*. Symptoms include drowsiness, heaviness, and tinnitus. Autumn or summer exposure to dew, followed by cold, may also trigger this illness. Acute cases involve excessive heat with little wind; chronic cases involve more wind than heat. Infants, unaware of wind exposure, contract this due to abundant blood and tender muscles, causing congealing.

Upon onset, immediately administer *Lòulú táng* to purge, apply small red bean powder to dissolve, and ingest *Wǔxiāng Liánqiāo táng*. See *yōng* (痈) section for formulas.

For *zéifēng* (acrobatic wind), the body lacks fever. Sudden exposure to violent wind and cold causes deep bone-joint pain without movement impairment. Pressure reveals bone pain, eventually forming persistent pain or lymph node swellings. Unlike *fùgǔjū*, which ulcerates and forms pus, treating *fùgǔjū* as *zéifēng* worsens the condition, deepening pus formation. Conversely, treating *zéifēng* as *fùgǔjū* exacerbates wind and cold, risking lymph node swellings, hemiplegia, or tendon contraction.

The efficacy of treatment lies in its proper beginning. This is not a matter for all under heaven to master unless they are of the utmost precision—who else could achieve such results?

If one discerns the differences between *fùgǔjū* and *zéifēng*, then in *fùgǔjū*, at its onset there is no swelling, only pain. In *zéifēng*, there is pain but no fever.

In *fùgǔjū*, the upper body exhibits robust heat, alternating between chills and fever in the limbs, with dark urine and constricted bowel movements, yet no sweating. If one can purge the heat and open the pores (*fānglǐ*), the condition will dissolve.

Even if it does not dissolve entirely, it will become superficial and near the surface.

In *zéifēng*, pain occurs only at night, the bones cannot be pressed or suppressed, movement is restricted, and the affected area does not exhibit robust heat. There are no alternating chills and fevers; instead, the body often feels cold and empty. Applying warmth to the painful area brings slight relief, and sweating may occasionally occur. These are the signs of *zéifēng*, which should be treated with acupuncture, moxibustion, and warming applications. All oral medications for wind will cure it. See the *fēng* (風) section for formulas.

There is also *fēngrèdú* (wind-heat-toxin), where the body first swells and then forms pustules like those scorched by fire; this is called *fēngrèdú*. Its treatment follows the same methods as for *dān* (丹, carbuncle).

There is also *hóngzhú chuāng* (boiling ulcer), where pustules suddenly erupt on the body like scalding water, severe cases spreading to the head and face. Some cases present with swelling in the chest, flanks, waist, or abdomen, while the entire body feels as if scorched by boiling water. This is the condition of *hóngzhú chuāng*.

To treat it, administer *Lòulú táng* (漏芦汤) immediately to purge, and apply *Shēngmá gāo* (升麻膏) externally. If *Shēngmá gāo* has no effect, follow the treatment method for *dān* (carbuncle).

For *féichuāng* (fat ulcers), once they appear, white pus and yellow necrosis form, and the sores remain shallow, only exuding yellowish fluid. This is called *féichuāng*.

For *jīnyànchuāng* (itching ulcers), scratching them shallowly causes them to spread uncontrollably. Those with severe itching, initially resembling *jiè* (疥, scabies), worsen when scratched, forming connected weeping sores—this is the condition.

For *yèchuāng* (ulcers of the extremities), the initial presentation is also like *féichuāng*, but they prefer to appear on the hands and feet, often growing in pairs, waxing and waning with the lunar cycle, causing pain, itching, and fissuring, with severity varying by season—this is the condition.

If a lingering *yōng* (痈, abscess) degenerates into deep *jū* (疽, carbuncle), it tends to arise in the *chángjīng* (腨经, channel between the buttocks) and exhibits stagnant water, foul discharge, and cold congealing within the sores, persisting for years and forming *gǔjū* (骨疽, bone carbuncle), also called *bìchuāng* (胻疮). The sores are deep, greenish-black, with hardened edges and pus-blood exuding from the center. Even with a hundred remedies, they do not heal; when the discharge drains, the surrounding flesh becomes hollow and swollen, and sometimes fragments of bone emerge. This can be treated by soaking in *Wēn Chìlóngpí táng* (温赤龙皮汤). See the *Qī+juàn* (七＋卷, Volume 7) under *Chángyōng* (肠痈, intestinal abscess).

In summer, wash daily; in winter, wash every four days.

If greenish flesh is abundant, apply *Báizhělú sǎn* (白豘茹散) to dissolve it. After three days of application, use *Jiāzhǐshǐ sǎn* (家猪屎散) to promote healing.

**Formula for Treating Hemorrhoids and Fistulas (痔漏方)**

**#1: Nine Fistulas – First on Scrofula (瘰疸) and Associated Treatments, with Moxibustion Methods (附论方灸法)**
The Master says: When the Nine Fistulas manifest as disease, they are all caused by cold and heat scrofula located in the neck and armpits. What *qi* causes them? These are all the toxic *qi* of cold and heat from *shǔyǐn* (鼠, a type of rodent or pestilential influence), which stagnates in the vessels and does not disperse.

The origin of *shǔyǐn* lies in the viscera, while its manifestations surface beneath the neck and armpits. When it floats within the vessels but has not yet lodged in the muscles, and externally forms pus and blood, it is easier to eliminate. How should it be treated?

The Master replies: Examine its superficial manifestations to diagnose its root cause. By following this method, one can weaken and eliminate the cold and heat, carefully applying the Dao/Way to treat it, gradually guiding its dispersion.

If the fistula is as small as a grain of wheat, one needle puncture (#2) suffices; three punctures are the limit.

How does one determine prognosis?
The Master replies: Observe the patient’s eyes—if a red vessel runs vertically through the pupil from top to bottom, the prognosis is as follows:
- If one vessel is seen, death occurs in one year.
- If one and a half vessels are seen, death occurs in one and a half years.
- If two vessels are seen, death occurs in two years.
- If two and a half vessels are seen, death occurs in two and a half years.
- If three vessels are seen, death occurs in three years.
If the red vessel does not descend through the pupil, treatment is still possible.

In general, if scrofula first appears along the neck edges or under the armpits, a fistula will soon develop. The patient must avoid the five pungent spices, alcohol, and all hot foods.

Fistulas may resemble stone abscesses, forming clustered nodules. If there are hard masses in the neck or under the armpits, with no pain or heat, practitioners should apply *Liànshí Sàn* (练石散, Refined Stone Powder) externally and administer *Wǔxiāng Liánqiào Tāng* (五香连翘汤, Five-Spice Forsythia Decoction) internally to purge them. Once the fistula has ruptured, treat it as an abscess.

For fistulas with unbroken nodules, use a fire needle to pierce directly into the center of the mass—this ensures recovery without fail.

**What are the Nine Fistulas?**
1. *Láng Lòu* (狼漏, Wolf Fistula)
2. *Shǔ Lòu* (鼠漏, Rat Fistula)
3. *Lóugū Lòu* (蝼蛄漏, Mole Cricket Fistula)
4. *Gǔ Lòu* (蛊漏, Witchcraft/Toxin Fistula)
5. *Pífú Lòu* (蚍蜉漏, Ant Fistula)
6. *Qíqiú Lòu* (蛴螬漏, White Grub Fistula)
7. *Fújǔ Lòu* (浮沮漏, Floating Stagnation Fistula)

**Kōngqīng Shānglǔ Sàn (空青商陆散, Celestite and Chinese Cocklebur Powder) – Treats *Láng Lòu* (Wolf Fistula):**
When it first appears, the neck swells without a head but with a root, originating above the supraclavicular fossa and extending to the ear, causing enlargement. This arises from emotional distress (*yōuyì*), where *qi* ascends but cannot descend; its root lies in the **liver** (or **lung**, as some texts say).

Celestite (*kōngqīng*) is the sovereign remedy, with Chinese cocklebur (*shānglǔ*) as the minister:
- Celestite (*Borax*) – 2 *fèn* (分)

When it first appears in the neck, it has no head or tail, resembling a *qúshǔ* (鼷鼠, a type of rodent), causing chills, fever, and flesh wasting. This arises from ingested rat poison that was not expelled; its root lies in the stomach.

Civet bone (*lígǔ*) is the sovereign remedy, with Anemarrhena (*zhīmǔ*) as the minister:
- Civet bone (*Viverra zibetha* bone) – equal parts

Sift the eight herbs, take one square-inch dose with a beverage, three times daily. Additionally, mix with honey and apply to the ulcer—this ensures recovery.

First, moxibustion is applied to form the ulcer; once the ulcer appears, no further moxibustion is needed.

---
**Dìhuáng Gāo (地黄膏, Rehmannia Paste) – Treats Recurrent or Unhealing *Shǔ Lòu* Fistulas with Persistent Pus and Blood:**
Use lard that has not been boiled in water, finely chop fresh Rehmannia (*shēng dìhuáng*), and blend thoroughly with the lard until fully amalgamated. Simmer until six or seven bubbles rise.

Before applying the paste, wash the ulcer with mulberry ash (*sānghuī*) solution to remove impurities, then apply the Rehmannia paste daily, changing it once per day.

---
**Formula for *Shǔ Lòu* (Rat Fistula):**
Burn a rat swallowed by a snake (*shéhuī suǒtūn shǔ*) into powder. Take one square-inch dose twice daily, no more than three doses—this is highly effective, though such rats are rare. The powder may also be applied directly to the ulcer for optimal results.

**Alternative Formula:**
- One medium-sized dead rat (*sǐshǔ*)
- A clump of tangled hair the size of a chicken egg (*luànfà rú jīzǐ dà*)

Cook with winter lard until fully dissolved. Divide the resulting paste into two portions: apply one portion gradually to the ulcer and administer the other portion gradually as a wine dose. Recovery follows, and the rat will emerge from the fistula—this is ideal.

---
**Róngzǐ Jújǐng Yuán (荏子桔梗圆, Radish Seed and Platycodon Pill) – Treats *Lóugū Lòu* (Mole Cricket Fistula):**
When it first appears in the neck, it resembles a swelling. This arises from ingested poison from melons or fruits that was not expelled; its root lies in the large intestine.

**Xiónghuáng Huánglián Sàn (雄黄黄苓散, Realgar and Coptis Powder) – Treats *Fēng Lòu* (Bee Fistula):**
When it first appears in the neck, scrofula forms in three or four connected clusters that eventually rupture. This arises from drinking water contaminated with wind-toxin that was not expelled; its root lies in the spleen.

Realgar (*xiónghuáng*) is the sovereign remedy, with Coptis (*huánglián*) as the minister:
- Realgar (*xiónghuáng*) – 1 *liǎng*

**Discussion of Prescriptions for Bee Fistula (Fēngzhuàng):**
Initially, it appears as a pruritic swelling the size of a peach. If scratched, it expands like an egg, covering the hand. After heating salt and ironing it for three consecutive nights, if it does not subside within four days, it will persist for a hundred days as a fistula. Its appearance will be like a stone four or five inches in diameter, three inches wide, with a central cavity where bees nest, numbering hundreds.

**Hemorrhoid and Intestinal Abscess Prescriptions**
**Section #1: Treatments for Intestinal Abscess (Chángyōng) – Moxibustion Method**

**Discussion:**
Sudden onset of intestinal abscess (*chángyōng*), if its symptoms are not recognized, may lead unskilled physicians to misdiagnose and kill the patient. The disease of intestinal abscess manifests as a heavy, rigid lower abdomen, which becomes painful upon pressure. Frequent urination resembling dysuria (*lín*), intermittent sweating, aversion to cold, and roughened skin like scales. The abdominal skin feels taut and swollen. If the pulse is rapid (*shuò*), there is some pus present. *Cáo Yuán* states: A surging and rapid pulse (*hóng-shuò*) indicates established pus. If the pulse is slow and taut (*chí-jǐn*), no pus has yet formed. In severe cases, the abdomen swells greatly, and gurgling sounds are heard upon movement. Sometimes ulcers form around the navel, or pus discharges from the navel, or bloody stool appears.

**Question:**
*A palace eunuch’s wife* suffers from this illness. How can one determine from the pulse whether a woman has pus in her intestines, and that administering a purge will cure her?

**Reply:**
If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is slippery (*huá*) and rapid (*shuò*), slipperiness indicates fullness (*shí*), rapidity indicates heat (*rè*). Slipperiness corresponds to the *róng* (nutritive) level, rapidity to the *wèi* (defensive) level. When the *wèi* level descends rapidly and the *róng* level ascends slipperily, their interaction causes blood to become turbid and decayed. This results in a firm, distended lower abdomen, possibly with difficult urination, intermittent sweating, or aversion to cold—signs that pus has already formed. If the pulse is slow and taut, it indicates stagnant blood (*yūxiè*), and purging it will bring relief.

**Prescription: Da Huang Mu Dan Tang (Rhubarb and Peony Decoction) for Intestinal Abscess**
- **Rhubarb (*Dà Huáng*)** – 4 *liǎng*
- **Peony (*Mǔ Dān*)** – 3 *liǎng*
- **Mirabilite (*Máng Xiāo*)** – 2 *liǎng*
- **Bitter Melon Seeds (*Guā Zǐ*)** – 1 *shēng*
- **Peach Kernels (*Táo Rén*)** – 50 kernels

**Preparation:** Chop the five ingredients coarsely. Decoct with 5 *shēng* of water, reducing to 1 *shēng*. Administer all at once to purge pus and blood.

*The Simplified Prescriptions* (*Shān Fán Fāng*) uses half a *hé* of mirabilite and 5 *hé* of bitter melon seeds.

**Liu Huánzǐ’s Method:** Uses 3 *hé* of *xiāoshí* (calcined alum), stating that intestinal abscess presents as a firm, distended lower abdomen, possibly localized to the left or right of the bladder. The affected area may be white, hot, and swollen like a palm. Urination may be regulated, but white sweat appears intermittently. If the pulse is slow and firm (*chí-jǐn*), pus has not yet formed, and purging is appropriate—expecting blood to follow. If the pulse is rapid, pus has formed, and purging is no longer advisable.

**The *Zhǒuhòu* [Elbow Post] Prescription** names *Gua Zi* Decoction.

**Decoction for Intestinal Abscess #3:**
Mulberry bark (*mùdān*) 2 *liǎng*
Licorice (*gān cǎo*) 2 *liǎng*
Fermented soybean (*bài jiàng*) 2 *liǎng*
Fresh ginger (*shēng jiāng*) 2 *liǎng*
Poria (*fú líng*) 2 *liǎng*
Platycodon root (*jué gěng*) 3 *liǎng*
Job’s tears (*yì yǐ rén*) 3 *liǎng*
Lily of the valley seed (*mài mén dōng*) 3 *liǎng*
Salvia root (*dān shēn*) 4 *liǎng*
Peony root (*sháo yào*) 4 *liǎng*
Raw Rehmannia (*shēng dì huáng*) 5 *liǎng*

The above eleven ingredients, [coarsely chopped], decocted with 1 *dǒu* of water, reduced to 3 *shēng*, divided into three doses, taken three times daily.

Another prescription:
Job’s tears (*yì yǐ rén*) 1 *shēng*
Mulberry bark (*mùdān pí*) 3 *liǎng*
Peach kernel (*táo rén*) 3 *liǎng*
Bitter melon seed (*guā bì rén*) 2 *shēng*

The above four ingredients, [coarsely chopped], decocted with 6 *shēng* of water, reduced to 2 *shēng*, divided into two doses.

**Yáo’s Method** omits peach kernel and uses apricot kernel (*xìng rén*) instead.

**Cui’s Method** adds 2 *liǎng* of mirabilite (*máng xiāo*), stating that if there is [abdominal] distension and pain, restlessness and toxic heat, or if the abdomen is bloated and full without the ability to eat or drink, and if urination is difficult, this is often intestinal abscess, though many fail to recognize it. Women who suffer from post-partum *xū rè* [postpartum deficiency-heat] often develop this condition. Even if it is not an abscess (*yōng*), administering this decoction will not cause further harm.

Another prescription:
Burn the feathers and excrement from the top of a rooster’s head into ashes, and take with wine on an empty stomach.

「Another prescription:
Cut a small amount from the tip of an eaves tile, burn to ash, mix with water and ingest. This will cause an abscess to rupture and drain pus and blood, leading to recovery.

For intestinal abscess (*yōng*), its symptoms include: the ear lobes’ veins and texture appearing twisted like scales. Initially, there is severe abdominal pain, or a sore near the navel like millet grains, with skin heat. Stool will contain pus and blood resembling red and white discharge. If untreated, death is certain.

**Prescription:**
Burn horse-hoof ash, mix with chicken egg white, and apply. This will expel the *qi*—no more than twice.

**Another prescription:**
Crush 3 *shēng* of pumpkin seeds into powder, decoct with 3 *shēng* of water, reducing to 1 *shēng* 5 *gē* (small cups), and divide into three doses.

**Another prescription:**
Take soil from atop a grave, form into paste, and apply.

**Prescription for internal abscess before it forms a head:**
Use dried hen dung (*fú jī fèi*), ingest it, and the condition will resolve.

**Another prescription:**
Mix horse-tooth ash with chicken egg white and apply. If dry, reapply.

**Moxibustion method for intestinal abscess:**
Bend both elbows, then apply direct moxa to the sharp *zhī gōu* (olecranon) bone of each elbow, 100 *zhàng* (moxa cones) per point. This will cause pus and blood to drain, leading to recovery.

**Discussion:**
After childbirth, one should frequently express breast milk and avoid letting it accumulate. If milk stagnates and is not expelled, it will congeal and fail to drain. The stagnant milk, accumulating internally, will draw heat and strengthen pathogenic factors, forming a firm mass that pulls and causes pain. Severe thirst and the urge to drink will arise, along with sharp breast pain—hands cannot approach it—resulting in *dòu rǔ* (breast abscess), which is not an abscess (*yōng*).

**Emergency treatment:**
Apply moxibustion to both *yú jì* (fish际, thenar eminence) points, 27 *zhàng* each, to sever the abscess *qi*. The aversion to hands near the breast will cease, and milk will drain on its own. One may then assist by gently compressing the breast, causing a large outflow of milk, resembling pus.

Internally, administer *lián qiáo tāng* (Forsythia Decoction), and externally apply a thin layer of *xiǎo dòu* (adzuki bean) paste. The condition will resolve.

For women and girls with shallow, hot sores on the nipple, itching and scratching causing yellow discharge, which spreads into various chronic forms—if untreated for years—this is called *dòu rǔ* (breast abscess).

Women who nurse their children should wean them, as the common practice of *gǒu chāi rǔ* (forced weaning) is appropriate.

**Treatment:**
Wash with *chì lóng pí tāng* (Dragon’s Skin Decoction) and *tiān má tāng* (Gastrodia Decoction), then apply *fēi wū gāo* (Flying Crow Ointment) or *fēi wū sǎn* (Flying Crow Powder)—both are excellent.

For early-stage cases, apply *huáng qín lòu lú sǎn* (Coptis and Reed Rhizome Powder) or *huáng lián hú fěn sǎn* (Coptis and Barite Powder)—both are also effective.

**Dragon’s Skin Decoction (*Chì Lóng Pí Tāng*):**
Use 3 *shēng* of *chì* (bitter orange) peel, cut, decoct with 1 *dòu* (10 *shēng*) of water, reducing to 5 *shēng*. Use cold in summer, warm in winter. Divide to wash the breast, also for deep, festering, long-standing sores. After washing, apply ointment or powder.

**Gastrodia Decoction (*Tiān Má Tāng*):**
Use 5 *shēng* of cut *tiān má* (Gastrodia), decoct with 1.5 *dòu* of water, reducing to 1 *dòu*. Apply warm or cool as needed to wash the breast, to alleviate itching. This herb’s leaves resemble hemp, blooming in summer with red flowers like rat-tail blossoms. It is also used to wash spreading, yellow, festering hot sores, itchy *jū* (boils), damp *yín* (vulvar) ulcers, and infant head sores. After washing, apply ointment or powder.

**Flying Crow Ointment (*Fēi Wū Gāo*):**
*Qīng fěn* (borax) is the black smoke produced when burning *zhū shā* (cinnabar) over mercury. Alternatively, *xiāng fěn* (alum). Use 3 *liǎng* each.
Grind the two ingredients into powder, knead with vinegar to a greasy consistency, and apply to breast sores three times daily. If making a powder, no need to knead—simply apply the powder directly to moist areas. It treats all hot sores, yellow festering sores with spreading discharge and itching, damp *yín* ulcers in men, infant head sores, *yuè shí* (mouth corner) eczema, and *chǐ* (eczema) sores.

**Coptis and Barite Powder (*Huáng Lián Hú Fěn Sǎn*):**
*Huáng lián* (Coptis) – 2 *liǎng*
*Hú fěn* (barite) – 10 *fēn*
*Shuǐ yín* (mercury) – 1 *liǎng*
Grind the *huáng lián* into powder, mix with the other two. Wrap in soft skin and knead until fully combined—it will naturally amalgamate. Even if not fully unified, finely powdered mercury can be mixed into the barite. Apply to breast sores, damp sores, yellow festering eczema, etc. If dry, mix with vinegar to form an ointment.

**Prescription for breast sores with pus formation:**
*Fēng fáng* (bee’s nest) – equal parts
*Pig’s horn inner earth* – equal parts
*Car wheel rut earth* – equal parts
Grind the three into powder, mix with *kǔ jiǔ* (sour wine), and apply.

**Deer Horn Powder (*Lù Jiǎo Sǎn*), for women with breast sores and pus discharge, unbearable pain:**
*Lù jiǎo* (deer horn) – 3 *fēn*
*Gān cǎo* (licorice) – 1 *fēn*

The two medicines above, for treating **inverted nipples** (*xià shāi*): grind and mix with chicken yolk in a copper vessel, place in a warm setting, and cauterize the application on the breast. Repeat twice daily, and it will heal; the method is highly effective but not widely shared.

**Prescription for inverted nipples:**
Take the ash of *kuí jīng* (borage stem), grind into a fine powder, and administer as a dose of one square inch (*fāngcùn bì*), three times daily—it will heal.

*The Collection of Verified Prescriptions* (*Jí Yàn Fāng*) states: "Grind directly into powder, do not make into ash."

Another prescription:
Burn a **self-dead snake** (*zì sǐ shé*) to ash, mix with pig fat, and apply. This is very effective.

**Moxibustion method:**
Take *pú* (reed grass), cut crosswise to measure the mouth, and align the cut with the nipple. Apply moxibustion to the cut ends, twenty-seven times.

**Discussion:**
After childbirth, if a woman does not breastfeed her infant or loses her child without breastfeeding, milk may accumulate and form **breast abscesses** (*rǔ jū yōng*). If she does not breastfeed and the breast swells, mix chicken white with small bean powder and apply to the breast to dissolve the blockage.

If she breastfeeds but the milk does not flow, frequently massage to release it. Alternatively, have an older child suck cold water into their mouth, then **gargle** (*shuò*) to cool the oral cavity and induce vomiting of the stagnant milk. If they do not gargle with cold water, the heat will linger, causing sores on the nipple and clogging the milk ducts.

In general, women often suffer from **breast abscesses**. Those under forty can be treated with many successful outcomes, but those over fifty should be treated cautiously—treatment often leads to death, while non-treatment allows them to live out their natural span.

Another prescription: **Three *shēng* of fresh *Dì Huáng* (rehmannia), three *hé* of *Máng Xiāo* (mirabilite), and one *shēng* of *zhǐ* (fermented soybean) are ground and mixed together, then applied while warm; replace it when it cools, until the abscess drains and heals. This is applicable to all abscesses and swellings.

One alternative: Simply apply fresh *Dì Huáng* (rehmannia) alone.

For treating **jealous breast** (*dú rǔ*) and breast abscesses with swelling:

Take **two *rǎn mǐ* chufang hammers** (medicinal hammers), toast until hot, and apply with cotton and used cloth to the breast. Then repeatedly press and warm with the hammer until the itching subsides. **Immediate effect** occurs upon application. **No further treatment** is needed.

For treating breast abscesses:
*Dà huáng* (rhubarb) – one part
*Shǔ shǐ* (fresh mouse dung) – one part
*Huáng lián* (coptis) – two parts

The above three ingredients are ground into a powder. Mix with **broth of glutinous millet** (*shǔ mǐ zhōu*) and apply to the **four sides of the breast** (*rǔ sì biān*). When the pain stops, the condition is cured. If glutinous millet is unavailable, **foxtail millet** (*sù mǐ*) or **brown rice** (*jīng mǐ*) may be substituted.

For treating breast abscesses:

*Dà huáng* (rhubarb) – two parts
*Mǎng cǎo* (alpine patrinia) – two parts

The above four ingredients are ground into a powder. Mix with vinegar and apply. The breast pain will cease, and it is effective.

Another prescription:
To treat prolapsed hemorrhoids (*xià shāi*), take *lù jiǎo* (deer antler) and prepare it as a decoction with the clear broth of *zhū zhī* (pork fat). Take one *fāngcùn* spoonful. Do not take it more than twice. Alternatively, it may be taken with vinegar and broth.

Another prescription:
Take *cōngbái* (green onion stalks), pound and apply them. Additionally, squeeze out one *shāng* (升) of juice and drink it all at once—this will cure the condition immediately.

For treating breast abscesses lasting two to three hundred days, where other treatments have failed, and the breast remains hardened and purple-green, use the *liǔ gēn* (willow root) moxibustion method:
Take willow root, scrape off the outer bark, pound until soft, and simmer until warm. Place it in a linen pouch and apply as a poultice to the breast. Replace when it cools. The condition will be cured by morning.

**Prescriptions for Hemorrhoids (痔漏方)**

**Third Treatise on Moxibustion for the Five Hemorrhoids (五痔第三论方灸法)**
The treatise states:

The Five Hemorrhoids are as follows:
1. **Male Hemorrhoid (牡痔)**—like rat nipples at the anus, frequently ulcerating with pus and blood;
2. **Female Hemorrhoid (牝痔)**—swelling and pain at the anus, forming sores;
3. **Vascular Hemorrhoid (脉痔)**—itching, pain, and sores at the anus;
4. **Intestinal Hemorrhoid (肠痔)**—hard, painful nodules at the anus, accompanied by chills and fever;
5. **Bleeding Hemorrhoid (血痔)**—passing clear blood with bowel movements, staining the undergarments.

Additionally, there is the **Qi Hemorrhoid (气痔)**, which flares with cold, heat, fatigue, or dampness—**snake shed skin** treats it.

- **Male Hemorrhoid** grows like a child’s nipple in the anus, protruding outward, obstructing defecation—**turtle shell** treats it.
- **Female Hemorrhoid** (*Jíyàn* edition: **Alcohol Hemorrhoid, 酒痔**) rises from the anus, swelling externally, and ruptures in five to six days, discharging pus and blood—**hedgehog skin** treats it.
- **Intestinal Hemorrhoid** protrudes during defecation, retracting only after time—**left hoof of a mare** treats it.
- **Vascular Hemorrhoid** bleeds clear blood upon defecation—**bee’s nest** treats it.

All five remedies are sifted through a fine sieve, divided equally, and the primary herb is doubled according to the ailment. Divide into three portions, and take half a *sháo* (方寸匕) with **well-water** in the morning. For severe cases, take it twice daily, or up to four or five times. Avoid cold foods, pork, raw fish, vegetables, and sexual activity. Only dry white meat may be eaten. After recovery, abstain from intercourse for a hundred days.

Additionally, when administering medicine, if there is a sore, place the drug inside it; if not, place it in the anus. Also, mix **wild kudzu ash** into the medicine, and after five days of treatment, the condition will be known; in twenty to thirty days, it will heal.

**General Prohibition for Hemorrhoid Pain:** Avoid excessive vegetable consumption.

**Prescription for the Five Hemorrhoids—When All Physicians Fail:**
- **Kuanqiong (秦艽)**
- **Bai zhi (白芷)**
- **Hou po (厚朴)**
- **Zi shen (紫参)**
- **Luan fa (乱发, disordered hair)**
- **Zi wan (紫菀)**
*(Each: 1 liang)*

**Total: 13 herbs.** Pound and sift, knead with **sheep marrow fat**, and form into pills the size of *wu zi* (梧子). Take 15 pills on an empty stomach, twice daily. For severe cases, take an additional dose at night. In four days, anal itching ceases; in eight days, pus and blood stop; and the rat-nipple-like growths wither. After sixty days, the condition will never recur. Prolonged use strengthens the effect. Avoid fish and pork.

---

From *Qianjin Yi* (《千金翼》), the dosage of **huái zǐ (槐子)** is unspecified. In *Shēnshī* (《深师》), **huáng qí (黄耆)** is omitted, stating that it treats cases of **kǔ bào (苦暴)**—where there is **gān zào (dryness), zhǒng tòng (swelling pain)**—while excluding those with **bēng xuè (metrorrhagia)** without specified quantity, **shǔ rǔ fù hé (鼠乳附核, hemorrhoidal nodules)**, or **cháng zhōng fán yǎng (intestinal itching)**. Those afflicted for **sān shí wǔ nián (thirty-five years)** may perish; the patient must avoid alcohol and strenuous labor, for transgression will provoke recurrence.

For **wǔ zhì (five types of hemorrhoids)** persisting for a decade, the following remedy with **xiǎo huái shí yuán (小槐实圆)** is prescribed:

- **Huái zǐ (槐子)** – 3 *jīn*
- **Bái táng (白糖)** – 2 *jīn*
- **Fán shí (矾石, alum)** – 1 *jīn*
- **Liú huáng (硫黄, sulfur)** – 1 *jīn*
- **Dà huáng (大黄)** – 10 *liǎng*
- **Gān qì (乾漆)** – 10 *liǎng*
- **Lóng gǔ (龙骨)** – 10 *liǎng*

**Total: 7 ingredients.**
Four of these are ground and sifted; the two minerals and sugar are finely chopped. Place them in a copper vessel, steam with **yī shí (一石) of rice**, then strain the liquid through cloth. Mix with the powdered herbs, knead into pills the size of *wú zǐ (梧子)*, and dry in shade. Take **20 pills in wine**, three times daily, gradually increasing to **30 pills**.

**Huái zǐ jiǔ (槐子酒)** for the same ailment:
- **Huái zǐ (槐子)** – 2 *dòu*
- **Huái dōngnán zhī (槐东南枝, branches from the southeast of the locust tree)** – finely chopped, 1 *shí*
- **Huái dōngnán gēn (槐东南根, roots from the southeast of the locust tree)** – finely chopped, 3 *shí*

Combine these three in a large pot with **shí liù hé (十六斛) of water**, boil to reduce to **wǔ hé (五斛)**, then clarify the liquid. Further reduce to **yī shí liù dǒu (一石六斗)**, cook **liǎng hé (两斛) of millet**, add **shàng qū (上曲, high-fermentation starter) of 20 *jīn*, and ferment. Stir until smooth, seal with clay for seven days. Once the wine is ready, drink the clear portion to mild intoxication, repeating the process by reboiling the dregs for fresh liquid. **Rinsing grains or washing utensils with water is forbidden**, as this wine must avoid contact with **shēng shuǐ (生水, untreated water)**.

Another remedy:
Apply **xióng dǎn (熊胆, bear bile)** topically until the condition resolves—this method is **shén liáng (神良, supremely efficacious)**.

All other remedies pale in comparison to this one.

Another remedy:
On the seventh day of the seventh month, gather an abundance of locust tree pods, pound them until ripe, and extract the juice. Place this in a copper vessel, cover tightly with thick layers of cotton, and suspend it in a high doorway of the residence. Expose it to the sun for twenty days or more, then boil it until the residue resembles mouse droppings in size. Insert this into the anal passage three times daily. This also treats fistulas and a hundred varieties of sores.

Another remedy:
Take ten *liǎng* of fresh white locust bark, pound it thoroughly, form into pills the size of a marble, wrap in cotton, and insert into the lower passage. This condition is best treated by regularly consuming *jiù zhú yè* (slippery elm leaves) and porridge made from them.

Another remedy:
Take three carp intestines, roast them over fire until fragrant, wrap in cotton, and insert into the anal passage. After one meal, the parasites will emerge to consume the intestines. Replace frequently. When all three intestines are exhausted, the condition will resolve. Another method involves roasting the intestines until fragrant, then placing them on the patient’s lap to draw out the parasites. This method has proven effective in practice.

Another remedy:
**Tiger-head rhinoceros horn** – grind these two ingredients into a powder, mix with **untreated pig fat** (not mixed with water) to form a paste the size of a chicken egg, and apply to the sore until it heals. This treats five types of hemorrhoids and prolapsed rectum.

**Remedy for five types of hemorrhoids:**
Two *liǎng* of white locust bark
Half a *jīn* of pig fat
Ten each of **lacquer seeds** and **peach kernels**
Seven **croton seeds**
**Smoke grass**, **magnolia flower**, **licorice root**, and **angelica root**, each half a *liǎng*
Six *qian* of **wild kudzu root**
Grind these ten ingredients coarsely, decoct three times (boiling and reducing), remove dregs, and use cotton to apply the residue into the anal passage four or five times daily. The parasites will die, and the condition will resolve. This also stops itching and pain effectively.

**Remedy for hemorrhoids:**
Cut a piece of pigskin three *cùn* in width, grind it into powder the size of a **dried jujube**, and mix with a roasted chicken egg the size of **mugwort**. Combine these three ingredients, dig a hole in the ground, and mix them thoroughly. Use this to fumigate the patient, ensuring yellow smoke emerges from the mouth. Once the fire’s heat dissipates, stop. Rest for three days, then repeat the fumigation three times total. The condition will resolve permanently. Avoid exposure to wind and cold, and refrain from consuming **sour or spicy foods** while taking supplements. Be cautious with pork and chicken.

Another remedy:
Boil and wash with **locust root**.

Another remedy:
Boil and wash with **peach root**.

**Pigskin roundel remedy for hemorrhoids (also treats fistulas):**
One **hedgehog skin**
Two *liǎng* each of **alum**, **dang gui**, **honeysuckle flower**, **dried ginger**, **processed aconite**, **continuous breakroot**, and **astragalus root**
Three *liǎng* of locust pods
Five *liǎng* of **dried rehmannia root**
Grind these ten ingredients into a powder, form into honey pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**. Take fifteen pills daily, twice a day, gradually increasing to forty pills. (*Collected Verified Remedies* omits alum and rehmannia.)

Another remedy for **uterine bleeding and hemorrhoids:**
Three *liǎng* each of **pigskin**, **ginseng**, **poria**, **angelica root**, **caltrop root**, **dried rehmannia root**, **locust ear**, and **continuous breakroot**
Two *liǎng* each of **pollens**, **astragalus root**, **dang gui**, **mugwort leaves**, **tangerine peel**, **white wax**, and **licorice root**
Soak **white horse-hoof** in wine overnight, then parch until yellow
Four *liǎng* each of **ox horn shavings** and **eel head** (twenty pieces)
Twenty-one **pig’s hanging hoofs**, parched
Grind these nineteen ingredients into a powder, form into honey pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**. Take twenty pills daily with wine, twice a day, gradually increasing the dose.

---

**Remedies for Hemorrhoids:**

Take **locust ear** and **red cockscomb** (one *jīn*)—this is called **槐檽** (*huái'ěr*). Grind into a powder and take with water one **方寸匕** (*fāngcùn shì* [a small spoonful]), three times daily.

Another remedy: Take **pollens** and serve with water, one **方寸匕** (*fāngcùn shì*), three times daily. This is excellent.

The *Wàitái* [External Canon] states: For **intestinal hemorrhoids** where blood is constantly passed during bowel movements.

**Remedy for Hemorrhoids with Bleeding and Postpartum Discharge:**
**Prepared aconite** and **good alum** (*shí fánshí*), each one *liǎng*.
Grind these two ingredients into a powder, form into honey pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**. Take with wine, two pills daily, three times a day, gradually increasing the dose.

No more than a few days and the bleeding will cease. Take for a hundred days, and hemorrhoids will never recur. *Cuī Shì Fāng* [Master Cuī’s Formulas] includes **dried ginger** (one *liǎng*).

**Remedy for External Hemorrhoids, Also Treating Malignant Sores and Prolapsed Hemorrhoids:**

**Pig fat** (*zhūgāo*), one *jīn*
Grind these five ingredients into a powder, mix with **pig fat** until well combined. Cut into pill-sized pieces the size of half a **chicken egg**, then fry in an **eastern-facing pan** three times, lifting and lowering. When the pills turn crispy and brown, remove them. Before applying, wash the hemorrhoids with **warm water** (*guàntāng*), dry them, and then coat with the ointment.

**Remedy for Hemorrhoids with Pus and Blood in the Lower Region, Presence of Worms, and Secondary Orifices:**
Take **white locust bark** (*huáibáipí*) one **dàn** (*dàn* [a large measure, ~100 *liǎng*]), shave it, and place it in a pot to boil until the flavor fully emerges. Transfer into a large basin, adjust the temperature to be neither too hot nor too cold, and sit in it like taking a bath. The worms will all come out. If it grows cold, replace it with fresh. No more than two or three sessions will cure the condition.

**Remedy for Anal Itching and Pain, Swelling with Raised Edges, and Fleshy Protrusions from Hemorrhoids:**
**Black soybeans** (*dàdòu*), three *shāng* (*shāng* [a measure, ~10 *liǎng*])
With seven *shāng* of water, boil quickly and reduce to four *shāng*
**White locust bark** (*huáibáipí*), three *shāng*
**Licorice root** (*gāncǎo*), three *liǎng*
The *Wàitái* [External Canon] uses **bee’s nest** (*fēngfáng*) instead of licorice
**Angelica root** (*báizhì*), two *liǎng*
Grind these three ingredients, then use **soybean broth** to boil and reduce to two *shāng*. Soak thin **cloth strips** (*gùbó*), replacing them when they cool. Apply three to five times daily.

**Locust Bark Ointment** (*Huáipí Gāo*), for **Anal Itching and Pain, Hemorrhoids:**
**Locust bark** (*huáipí*), five *liǎng*
**Chinese hophornbeam fruit** (*liànshí*), five *liǎng* (the *Wàitái* [External Canon] uses **dried soybean powder** (*chénshǐ*))
**Licorice root** (*gāncǎo*), two *liǎng* (the *Shānfán Fāng* [Simplified Formulas] uses **bee’s nest** (*fēngfáng*))
**Angelica root** (*báizhì*), two *liǎng*
**Dang gui** (*dāngguī*), three *liǎng*
**Peach kernels** (*táorén*), sixty pieces
**Red adzuki beans** (*chìxiǎodòu*), two *hé* (*hé* [a measure, ~10 *liǎng*])
Grind these seven ingredients coarsely. Use **pig fat** rendered into ointment (one *jīn*) and simmer with **angelica root** over low heat until the ointment turns yellow. Apply to the affected area twice daily, and also use as an **enema** for the lower region.

*The Shānfán Fāng* [Simplified Formulas] omits **dang gui**, treating **kidney exhaustion** (*shènláo xū*) or **wind damage to the kidneys** (*jīng yǐn suǒ sǔn*)—such as when **drunkenness in the wind** (*jiǔzuì dāngfēng*) injures the kidney, causing **anal swelling and sores** (*bìngsuǒwéi gāngmén zhǒngshēng chuāng*). The condition manifests as **clear blood discharge from strain** (*yīn jiǔ láo shāng fāxiè qīngxuè*), and **anal pain** (*gāngmén téngtòng*). Use **bee’s nest ointment** (*fēngfáng gāo*).

**Remedy for Anal Pain:**
Take **cuscuta seed** (*húshízǐ*), parch until yellow-black, and mix with **egg yolk** (*jīzǐhuáng*) to apply. Do this twice daily.

---

**Another Remedy:**
Take apricot kernels, parch them until yellow, pound into a grease, and apply.

**Remedy for Sudden Anal Pain:**
As in the Crow-Pecking Remedy: Use equal parts of large and small red beans, pound together, place in two sacks, and steam until extremely hot. Alternate sitting on them until cured.

**Moxibustion Method:**
For chronic cold with five hemorrhoids and bloody stools, apply moxibustion to the back’s central line for 100 cones. For five hemorrhoids with bloody stools and incontinence, apply moxibustion to the *Huīqì* point (回气穴) for 100 cones; the acupoint lies above the *Jīngqióng* bone (脊穷骨).

**Fourth Remedy for Scabies and Itch (from *Xīnxiū Fāng*):**
For all scabies and itch, use *Xīnxiū* powder (小秦艽散) with added **cowry flesh** (*wūshé ròu*)—two *liǎng* (两)—as the primary formula. **Huángqí** wine (黄耆酒) with added **cowry jerky** (*wūshé fǔ*)—one *chǐ* (尺)—also yields great results.

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) states: In **Huángqí** wine, add **cowry jerky**—one *chǐ*—along with **aconite** (*wūtóu*), **processed aconite** (*fùzǐ*), **Colocasia root** (*yīnyǔ*), **Rhododendron leaf** (*shílán*), and **Artemisia vulgaris** (*mǎngcǎo*), each in equal parts. Adding this to **Dàqín huāng** powder (大秦荒艽) also proves highly effective. For minor scabies and itch, the **Shíliùwèi Xīnxiū** powder (十六味小秦艽散) is equally suitable. **Huángqí** wine is detailed in the **24th Volume**.

For all scabies and itch, use **mercury** (*shuǐyín*) and **pig fat** (*zhūzhī*), finely ground together, and apply.

**Remedy for General Scabies and Itch (affecting waist, groin, hands, and feet):**
**Bitter apricot root** (*kuǒluó gēn*)—four *liǎng* (两)
**Coptis rhizome** (*huánglián*)

Each in three *liǎng* (两), except **Sophora**, **Huángqí**, **Scutellaria**, and **Ophiopogon**, which are two *liǎng* (两).

Pound into powder, form honey pills the size of **Chinese hackberry** (*wúzǐ*). Take with **rose decoction** (*qiángwēi yǐn*)—twenty pills, three times daily, increasing to thirty until itching ceases. **Contraindicated for dry scabies** (*gānjiè*) and **white ringworm** (*báixuǎn*).

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) states that all **abscesses and boils** (*yōngjū*) must be treated with this remedy.

**Remedy for Cold-Heat Sores and Wind-Scabies (various miscellaneous sores):**
**Century-old leek root** (*qiānnián jiǔ gēn*)

Each—one *fēn* (分)
**Mercury** (*shuǐyín*)—three *fēn* (分)

Pound the **mercury** with **willow wood** (*liǔmù*) until fully integrated. Boil **pig fat** (*zhūzhī*)—one *shēng* (升)—with **Puncturevine**, **leek root**, and **calabash stem** until three cycles of boiling, remove dregs, and mix with the remaining ingredients, blending until harmonized. Apply as an ointment—it is miraculously effective. *The Emergency Remedy* (《救急方》) uses this for **ringworm** (*xuǎn*).

**Remedy with *Rú* Grease (for all malignant sores, scabies, itch, abscesses, and fistulas):**
**Rú** (*rú*)
**Lycium root** (*lángyá*)

**Croton seed** (*bādòu*)—fourteen kernels

Boil the **hair** until fully dissolved, add **pine resin** and **honey**, simmer three times, remove dregs, and mix with the powders, boiling once more before application.

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) uses **beeswax** (*là*) instead of **honey**.

Grind into powder, mix with **pig fat** (*zhūzhī*)—seven *hé* (合)—until **mercury** is no longer visible. Apply as an ointment. Some versions add **Puncturevine** (*chílú*)—one *liǎng* (两)—or specify **Rú** (*rú*).

**Remedy for Persistent Scabies, Itch, and Sores:**
**Mercury** (*shuǐyín*)—one *jīn* (斤)
**Pig fat in December** (*làyuè zhūzhī*)—five *jīn* (斤)

Boil in an **iron vessel** (*tiěqì*), stacking the stove, using **horse dung** (*mǎtōng*) as fuel. Keep the fire burning for seven days and nights without pause. Once cooled, extract the grease, removing the **mercury**. The grease can be used independently or mixed with other formulas, and applied to all sores—it will cure them instantly upon contact.

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) also recommends grinding **mercury** into a powder and mixing it with **pig fat**.

**Another Remedy:**
**Fresh cow urine** (*tèniú*)
**Goat’s hoof root** (*yángtí gēn*)
Each—five *shēng* (升)

Steep **Goat’s hoof root** in **cow urine** overnight, dry in the sun daily, and re-steep until fully exhausted. Grind into powder and apply to all sores.

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) states that mixing with **pig fat** yields even better results.

**Another Remedy:**

**Another Remedy:**
Take ten fresh **monkshood roots** (*wǔtóu*), cut, and boil the juice to wash the sores until cured. The text states: All manner of **sores and scabies** (*chuángxiǎn*), when first appearing or just beginning to itch and ache, should be treated with various simple remedies—such as chewing salt and applying it, or using **rice wash** (*gǔzhī*) to rub, or mixing with **garlic ink** (*suànmò*)—*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* says garlic should be made into **garlic oil** (*suànróu*). Again, apply **turmeric** (*jiānghuáng*) to the sores; again, apply **pounded crucian carp** (*lǐyú cuì*) to the sores; again, apply the juice of **hawthorn** (*niúlǐzi*) to the sores. If these treatments fail to cure, then apply the previously mentioned **major formulas**.

**Remedy for Mild Scabies:**
**Snakehead root** (*shécuòzi*)
**White kaolin** (*báiniè*, also known as *báihè*)
**Goat’s hoof root** (*yángtí gēn*)—each, one *shēng* (升)

**Coptis rhizome** (*huánglián*)
**Imperata rhizome** (*mángcǎo*)—each, three *liǎng* (两)

The eight aforementioned ingredients, □-chewed, are boiled in seven *shēng* of water, reducing to three *shēng*. Apply while warm to wash the body, as if steaming one *dàn* (石) of rice. After straining, use the clear liquid while still slightly warm, for three consecutive days.

**Another Remedy:**
Pound **goat’s hoof root** on a grinding stone with **sour wine** (*kǔjiǔ*), and apply to the sores. Before applying, scrape the sores until they bleed, then dry with heat and apply again, four or five times. *The Thousand-Gold Supplement* states: Pound **goat’s hoof root** in a ceramic vessel, mix with **white honey** (*báimì*), and before use, scrape the sores until they bleed, then apply the mixture of honey and root. After steaming as if cooking one *dàn* of rice for a long time, wipe away, and then apply a mixture of **two-year-old garlic** (*èrnián dàsuàn*). If the scraping does not cause bleeding, the sores will not heal.

**Another Remedy:**
Five *shēng* of **goat’s hoof root**, boiled in **mulberry twig ash decoction** (*sāngchái huīzhī*) until four or five times reduced, then used to wash the sores. For all remedies using **goat’s hoof root**, it is best to harvest it before sunrise.

**Another Remedy:**
Five *jīn* of **acorus powder** (*chāngpú mò*), steeped in five *shēng* of wine in a pot, and steamed until the flavor permeates. Abstain from wine for one day beforehand; each dose, one *shēng* or half *shēng*.

**Another Remedy:**

**Discourse on *Evil Sores* and *Great Wind* (第五论方)**
The text states:
*Evil sores* and *Great Wind* manifest in many forms. At onset, though the body may appear unchanged, the eyebrows and beard may already fall out. In some, the body is ravaged while the eyebrows and beard remain intact. Some show no outward difference from healthy individuals, yet have stubborn patches on limbs or torso—severe cases may see fingers and toes already fallen. Some suffer extreme cold, unaffected by heavy clothing, while others endure constant heat, unable to find relief. Some wither and shrivel, others suffer unceasing discharges. Some endure bone-deep itching, scratching until the skin flakes like bran, leaving raw sores beneath. (*The Waì Tái* records this as "sudden onset without sores.") Some develop layered, overlapping ulcers, enduring unrelenting day-and-night pain. Others remain numb, unaware of pain or itch.

The colors also vary—greenish, yellow, red, white, or black, with some lesions bright and others dull.

Though these symptoms differ, their ease or difficulty of cure depends not on the physician but on the patient. Why? Because once afflicted, whether wise or foolish, patients resist treatment. Their words may comply, but their hearts do not. They rely solely on medicine, neglecting self-correction, making cure dependent on chance rather than skill. I have personally treated over six hundred such cases, with one in ten recovering. Each was tended with meticulous care, yet those unwilling to engage—those who refuse guidance—are doomed to harm. If the disease persists, effort is wasted.

The *Divine Immortals’ Transmission* recounts many who attained Dao through *Evil Sores*. Why? Because they abandoned worldly attachments, embracing the *Pre-Heavenly* wind, transforming misfortune into fortune. Thus, curing this ailment is not merely healing—it is seizing blessing from calamity.

Among my patients were scholars, officials, and even renowned outsiders. All clung to wives and desires, unable to let go, fixating on medicine alone. If they could sever cravings, abandon attachments, not only would the disease vanish, but they might attain immortality.

I questioned patients, and all confessed to past wrongdoing—some even to vile deeds—yet still hoped to repeat them, speaking of regret without true remorse. If they sincerely repent, follow a teacher’s guidance, and diligently take medicine, recovery is certain.

During the *Zhēnguān* era, I led a patient into the mountains, instructing him to consume **pine resin** (*sōngzhī*) for a hundred days, after which his eyebrows and beard would regrow. This proves that cure depends on self-correction, not medicine alone.

Yet some suffer for years in shame, hiding their condition from family. By the time they seek help, the disease is advanced, and they falsely claim it was caused by medication—self-deception.

Though severe, this ailment can be cured early. Without treatment, death follows within a decade at most, or five to six years at worst. Yet patients delude themselves, believing they will live a hundred years—a tragic misjudgment.

Upon contracting this disease, one must immediately abandon salt, consume **pine resin**, and forsake all worldly affairs—public and private—like discarding old shoes. All tastes must be rejected, gradually reducing grain intake, avoiding social engagements, and severing ties to mourning and celebrations. Secluding oneself in secluded valleys for a year brings cure, but lifelong abstinence from carnal matters is required—violation will cause recurrence.

This disease carries two fates: those who cultivate virtue fare well, while those who remain entangled in worldly pursuits meet ruin.

I now briefly explain its origins, so later scholars may reflect.

**Prescription for *Evil Sores* Using *Black Soybeans* (*wūdòu*):**
Take **black soybeans** (*wūdòu*), selecting only those whose skins do not rub off. In the third or fourth month, gather **Aconitum carmichaelii** (*tiānxiōng*)—both root and sprout—clean but unwashed, pound and strain to extract the juice. Soak the soybeans in this juice overnight, drain, and dry in the sun. Repeat this process seven times before ingestion.

Begin with three beans daily, gradually increasing to six or seven. Avoid sexual activity, pork, fish, chicken, and garlic. If taken correctly, hair and nails will regrow. Failure to comply will prevent cure.

**Wolf Poison** (*lángdú*)
**Sophora flavescens** (*qínjiāo*) – equal parts

Grind into a powder. Take **one cubic inch** with wine, three times daily, for fifty days to effect a cure.

**Further Prescriptions:**

Refine pine resin by immersing it in cold water twenty times. Form into honey pills, and take two pills whenever hungry, three times daily. For a severed nasal septum, take for two hundred days to heal. Abstain from washing the face, mixed foods, and sexual activity. Alternatively, take *Asparagus* (*tiānméndōng*) in wine for one hundred days to cure.

**Lime Wine for Hair and Beard Growth, Treating *Great Wind* (大風):**
Take one *dàn* (石) of lime, mix with water until moist, and steam until the *qi* is potent. Refine ten *jīn* (斤) of pine resin into powder. Use one *dōu* (斗) two *shēng* (升) of *upper ferment* (上曲) and one *dàn* of millet (黍米).

Combine these four ingredients. First, roast the lime in a large pot until it emits *qi* (火出為度). Grate five *dōu* of *Lycium root* (枸杞根), boil with fifteen *shēng* of water, reduce to nine *dōu*, strain, and drip over the lime three times. Clarify the liquid, mix with the ferment, and ferment like wine. Seal for forty-nine days before consumption. Ensure the wine’s *qi* permeates evenly—take without restriction, but avoid wind exposure.

Bury the lees and rice husks deeply; neither humans nor animals should consume them. Brew this wine from the ninth month to the second month to prevent overheating. For those with heat above the diaphragm, consume three to five mouthfuls of cold rice afterward to press it down.

Women unable to eat, those chronically yellow and emaciated, or those afflicted by *mò fēng* (募風) will recover after one *dàn* (石). When spreading pine resin powder on rice, do so only after the rice has cooled. Wine and rice must be cold; otherwise, use vinegar.

Scrofula and leprosy (赤白癞),
Eight winds and twelve *bì* (痹),
Stiff tendons and lax limbs,

Soak these two in a ceramic jar with one *hú* (斛) of water. Cook one *dàn* of millet and ferment as usual, ensuring the ferment and millet are submerged. After three fermentations, seal for twenty-one days. When opened, the ferment should float, and the wine should be clear. Take warm, three *shēng* for robust cases, two *shēng* for mild ones. Induce vomiting or purgation as needed.

Dietary restrictions: Consume weak-cooked rice and broths of cow, sheep, or deer. Avoid raw, cold, slippery foods, pork, dogs, chickens, and fish.

**For Wind-Induced Crawling Sensations (身體如蟲行):**
Use one *dōu* of salt, boil with one *dàn* of water until reduced by half. Strain, warm, and bathe three to four times. This treats all wind-related ailments.

**Further Prescriptions:**
Wash the face with pure ash water for no more than one month.

Wash the face and hair daily with warm water from soaked soybean rice. Add a small amount of ferment; do not rinse with plain water. Repeat no more than ten times.

**Detoxification and Miscellaneous Remedies**
**First Treatise: Resolving Food Poisoning**

**Treatise:**
When people traverse mountains and rivers, unfamiliar with local waters and soils, and both humans and livestock consume contaminated food or drink, unwittingly ingesting poison, yet lacking knowledge of remedies, many perish in vain—how tragic! Yet the Sage of Ages has long established methods to rescue and revive them.

Alas, men are greedy for life and pleasure, neglecting to learn, and when misfortune strikes, they resign themselves to fate, unaware of the means to save themselves. Now I recount the methods of **Shénnóng** and **Huángdì** for resolving poison—let those who seek knowledge take heed.

**Remedies for General Food Poisoning:**
Drinking **Huánglóng** (*Huánglóng* soup) or **rhinoceros horn juice** cures all cases.
Drinking **horse urine** is also effective.

**Remedy for Food Poisoning with Restlessness:**
**Kǔshēn** (*Kǔshēn* root) – 3 *liǎng*, chopped, boiled in 2.5 *shēng* of wine, reduced to 1 *shēng*, taken at once to induce vomiting until recovery.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Any Consumed Substance:**
Dig a pit beside a latrine, one *chǐ* deep. Fill it with water, then take seven **latrine sticks** (*cè*), ignite them to produce smoke, and cast the smoldering sticks into the water. Drink four or five *shēng* of the liquid immediately—cure follows. If sticks are unavailable, dig a hole, fill it with water, and drink it at once.

**Alternative Remedies:**
Drink several *shēng* of fresh **garlic juice**.
Hold a **mother-of-pearl bead** (*bèizi*) in the mouth until vomiting expels the poisoned food.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Consuming Livestock Meat:**
Grind the **dried feces** of the respective livestock into powder and administer with water—excellent.

If the meat is from **dead livestock**, take **Huángbò** (*Huángbò* bark) powder, 1 *sháo* (square-inch measure), dissolved in water—rapidly effective.

**Alternative Remedies:**
Burn **small red beans** (*xiǎodòu*), 1 *shēng*, into powder; take 3 *sháo*—highly efficacious.
Take **kiln-bottom yellow earth** powder, 1 *sháo*, dissolved in water.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Raw Meat:**
Dig three *chǐ* deep, take three *shēng* of the lower soil, boil in five *shēng* of water until five or six boilings, then drink the clear, floating liquid—one *shēng* cures instantly.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Beef:**
Burn **wolf’s teeth** (*lángyá*) to ash, dissolve in water, and take 1 *sháo*—effective.
*(Alternative: **pig’s teeth**.)*

「**Alternative Remedies:**
Warm water administered with **pig fat** (*zhūzhī*)—excellent.
Boil **licorice root** (*gāncǎo*) in water and drink the juice—efficacious.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Beef or Horse Meat:**
Drink **human breast milk**—excellent.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Raw Horse Liver or Blood, Causing Sudden Death:**
**Mustard seeds** (*jiè*), 200 grains
**Apricot kernels** (*xìngrén*), 2+ pieces
These two ingredients, □-chewed, are steamed with five *shēng* of cooked rice, then pounded into a paste while still warm; take it twice until fully consumed—effective.

**Alternative Remedy:**
Drink **reed root** (*lúgēn*) juice while bathing—immediately resolves.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Raw Horse Liver, Fatal to Humans:**
**Male mouse dung** (*mǔshǔ fèn*), 27 pieces (preferably those with pointed ends), dissolve in water and drink; if symptoms persist, repeat.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Wild Vegetables, Horse Liver, or Various Dried Meats:**
Take **head dandruff** (*tóumáo*) the size of a **date pit** (*zǎo hé*), swallow it whole—can revive the dead.

**Alternative Remedy:**
Burn **dog dung** (*quǎnshǐ*) to ash, mix with water, strain, and drink the juice—immediately effective.

**Alternative Remedy:**
Burn **pig bones** (*zhūgǔ*) into powder, take with water—1 *sháo* dose.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Livers of All Beasts:**
Swiftly consume **pig fat** (*zhūzhī*), 1 *jīn*—excellent; also effective for poisoning from **aged meat**.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Dog Meat, Causing Indigestion, Abdominal Distension, Thirst, Heat, or Sudden Death:**
**Apricot kernels** (*xìngrén*), 1 *shēng*, with skin, □-chewed, mixed with three *shēng* of boiling water, strained, and the juice taken in three divided doses. All fragments of dog meat will be expelled, and symptoms will subside—highly verified.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Pig Meat:**
Burn **pig dung** (*zhūshǐ*) into powder, take with water—1 *sháo* dose. **Dog dung** (*quǎnshǐ*) is also excellent.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Leaky Dried Meat (漏脯):**
Zhang Wenzhong states: All **dried meats** (*pú*) stored in **thatched huts** (*máoshì*) become **leaky dried meats** (*lòupú*).

Zhang Wenzhong states: Meat sealed in a **container** (*mìqì*) overnight becomes **damp dried meat** (*shīpú*).
Burn **dog dung** (*quǎnshǐ*) into powder, take with water—1 *sháo* dose.
**All raw or cooked meats** must not be stored deeply; if sealed tightly without **venting the *qi*** (*bù xiè qì*), they will kill. Similarly, meat juices stored in a sealed container without **venting the *qi*** will also be fatal.

**Remedy for Poisoning from Dried Meat in Glutinous Rice (黍米中毒):**

**Salt** (*yán*), two pinches

*The *Zhǒuhòu Fāng* states:* All **emetic remedies** (*zhūyào*) should also be administered.

**Alternative Remedies:**
Burn **sandfish skin** (*tāiyú pí*) to ash, take with water—avoid using **whole skin** (*wán pí*), as it may harm the **stomach**; strain the ash with a **cloth** (*huài dāo*) and take the juice. Also known as **sandfish skin** (*jiāoyú pí*).
*The *Gǔjīn Lùyàn* states:* For poisoning from **loach and eel** (*qiūyú*).

**Remedy for Poisoning from Wild Mountain Fungi:**
Drink **human feces juice** (*rénshǐ zhī*), 1 *shēng*—excellent.

**Discourse on Resolving All Poisons (Second Treatise)**
**Licorice Root as a Universal Antidote:**
Licorice root (*gāncǎo*) resolves all poisons—this is truly like **hot water poured on snow** (*tāng wò xuě*), a divine and wondrous effect.
There are cases where **aconite** (*wūtóu*) or **croton seed** (*bādòu*) poisoning is administered licorice root, and the symptoms immediately stabilize. For **Lophatherum poisoning** (*línglú*), drinking it with **onion soup** (*cōng tāng*) resolves the issue. For **wild hemp** (*yěgě*) poisoning, drinking it with **muddy water** (*tǔjiāng*) stops the symptoms.
Such efficacy is as swift as **turning one’s hand** (*fǎn zhǎng*), yet people refuse to learn it—truly lamentable.

**Licorice-Soybean Decoction as a Universal Antidote:**
The **soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*) remedy is said to resolve all poisons, but in my experience, its efficacy is vastly inferior to licorice root. However, it can be enhanced as a **licorice-soybean decoction** (*gāndòu tāng*), with remarkable results.

There are cases where someone takes the **Jade Bottle Pill** (*yùhú wán*), causing **persistent vomiting** (*ōu*), and no other remedy stops it, yet **indigo juice** (*lán zhī*) is taken and symptoms immediately stabilize.
Such cases must be known—these are established principles requiring no further testing or verification.

**General Rules for Antidote Remedies:**
The principles for resolving poisons are numerous; if not a few are highlighted, learners will not swiftly grasp the rest.»

**Remedies for Dissolving Poisons and Miscellaneous Treatments**
**Discourse on the Five *Shí* (石) Poisons (Third Treatise)**

**Prescriptions and Symptoms**
The discourse states: If one does not ingest *shí* (石), all mundane affairs will be unsatisfactory. Chronic sores, scabies, seasonal epidemics, and malaria—if these ailments persist year after year, disrupting sleep and meals, causing constant discomfort in daily activities—then it is not merely one’s own health that will not improve, but also the difficulty in raising children. Thus, when *shí* (石) resides within the body, all matters will be in disarray; therefore, one must never ingest the Five *Shí* (石).

One may ingest *shí* (石) remedies beginning at age thirty, but if one is constitutionally obese or of robust build, one must not recklessly take them. At forty, it is necessary to ingest them. At fifty, one may take a dose every three years. At sixty, one may take a dose every two years. At seventy, one may take a dose annually.

It is also said: Once a person reaches fifty, their vital essence (*jīnghuá* 精华) and blood (*xiā* 血) begin to decline. Ingesting *shí* (石) still yields its benefits. At sixty, the effects of *shí* (石) diminish, and one struggles to gain its strength. Hence, one must habitually ingest *shí* (石) to maintain warm hands and feet, nourish the marrow, dispel inherent coldness, and ensure lightness in movement. This also fortifies one’s tolerance to heat and cold, preventing the onset of various illnesses. Therefore, it is greatly beneficial to ingest *shí* (石).

All *shí* (石) must be refined and processed before use.

When *shí* (石) begins to act, one will inevitably experience cold sensations, headaches, and a stifled heart. Its effects manifest at certain times, resembling seasonal malaria. If these symptoms appear, one should immediately bathe in cold water to suppress them. Once the cold is felt, it will cease. All cold foods must be avoided, except wine, which must be warmed. The methods for dissolution are detailed below. For cases of *fābèi* (发背) or festering abscesses, refer to separate volumes.

It is also said: Those who ingest *shí* (石) must be extremely cautious with their diet, even if a hundred dishes are presented. One must never consume heavy meats, as such foods will inevitably harm the *shí* (石). If these dietary restrictions are violated, the *shí* (石) will accumulate and become agitated, leading to further illness.

If one adheres to the method with a steadfast mind and carefully regulates their intake, the *shí* (石) remedies will be beneficial. I, at ages thirty-eight and thirty-nine, once ingested five or six *liǎng* (两) of *shí* (石) and have since deeply understood its nature. Regarding rest and moderation, I have come to recognize its properties. Those who practice life-nourishment (*yǎngshēng* 养生) should take careful note.

However, the *shí* (石) must be sourced from pure, white, and lustrous soil, where the patterns are clear and the wings are black—all characteristics must be complete. Only then may it be ingested. If not from such soil, one must be wary, as many such cases have proven fatal, even more so than *zhèn* (鸩) poison.

*Zǐshí* (紫石) and *Báishí* (白石) must be uniformly transparent, with a smooth, bright luster. If they lack these qualities, they must not be ingested.

The *Hánshí* (寒石) Five *Shí* (石) Powder (*Sǎn* 散) was not recorded by ancient sages. Its use began with a certain *Héhóu* (何侯) in the late Han Dynasty. Since the time of *Huángfǔ Shì’ān* (皇甫士安), those who have recommended it without proper refinement have all suffered from *fābèi* (发背), dissolution of the body, and eventual collapse.

Since I have gained understanding of its nature, I have witnessed many officials in both court and countryside who fell victim to this, and not without number. Therefore, I would rather consume wild *gě* (葛) than ingest the Five *Shí* (石). I know their potent toxicity and urge caution. Those who encounter this prescription should immediately burn it, lest it linger too long.

Now, I only record the antidotes to prevent those who might ingest it firsthand. The prescription itself should be destroyed by smoke and not retained, as it harms living beings.

**Scallion-White Bean (*Báidòu* 豉) Decoction**
*Scallion* (*cōngbái* 葱白) – ½ *jīn* (斤)
*White beans* (*báidòu* 豉) – 2 *shēng* (升)
*Licorice* (*gāncǎo* 甘草) – 3 *liǎng* (两)
*Ginseng* (*rénshēn* 人参) – 3 *liǎng* (两)
(*According to the *Wàitái* (外台) text, substitute *Wúzhūyú* (吴茱萸) – 2 *shēng* (升) for *gāncǎo* 甘草*)

These four ingredients, chopped finely, are decocted first with 15 *shēng* (升) of water to make a scallion broth. After straining, retain 8 *shēng* (升) of the clear liquid. Add the remaining three ingredients and decoct again to reduce to 3 *shēng* (升). Divide into three doses. Upon ingestion, immediately have the patient massage and shake their body, chew something, then lie on their back, covered with warm clothing. Once sweating begins, remove the clothing. After the decoction has cooled, consume only dry, warm rice and dried meat.

If this remedy does not dissolve the *shí* (石), ingest the *Licorice* (*Gāncǎo* 甘草) Decoction:

**Licorice Decoction**
*Licorice* (*gāncǎo* 甘草) – 3 *liǎng* (两)
*Cinnamon bark* (*guìxīn* 桂心) – 2 *liǎng* (两)

This prescription shares similarities with the subsequent **#4** *Scattered Abscesses of the Body, Barley Winterheath Decoction* but differs slightly in dosage. The **Du Zhong Decoction** pairs sulfur with *fángfēng* (防风) and also with *xìxīn* (细辛), primarily treating the spleen and kidneys while addressing the waist and legs. *Fángfēng* activates sulfur, causing restlessness, heat, leg pain, and lumbar ache—or sudden anger, or uncontrollable diarrhea. Though *fángfēng* and *xìxīn* can activate sulfur, sulfur cannot activate them in return.

At the first sign of eruption, take this decoction:
**Du Zhong** (杜仲) 3 *liǎng*
**Zhìshí** (枳实), **Gāncǎo** (甘草), **Lǐhé Rén** (李核仁) each 2 *liǎng*
**Xiāng Bèi** (香豉) 1 *shēng*
**Zhīzǐ Rén** (栀子仁) 14 kernels
*(Six ingredients, prepared as before.)*

If unresolved, take the **Dà Mài Nǚ Decoction**:
**Dà Mài Nǚ** (大麦奴) 4 *liǎng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草), **Rénshēn** (人参), **Mángxiāo** (芒硝), **Guìxīn** (桂心) each 2 *liǎng*
**Mài Mén Dōng** (麦门冬) ½ *jīn*
*(Six ingredients, prepared as before.)*

If heat lingers in the spleen and kidneys—or if cold persists—take the **Rénshēn Decoction**:
**Rénshēn** (人参), **Gānjiāng** (乾姜), **Gāncǎo** (甘草), **Dāngguī** (当归) each 1 *liǎng*
**Fúzi** (附子) 1 piece
*(Five ingredients, prepared as before.)*

The **Fresh Barley Winterheath Decoction** pairs *báishíyīng* (白石英) with *fúzi* (附子), treating the stomach while addressing the spleen and kidneys. *Fúzi* activates *báishíyīng*, causing restlessness, abdominal distension. *Báishíyīng* activates *fúzi*, leading to vomiting, inability to eat, locked jaw, slurred speech, or limb pain.

At the first sign, take this decoction:
**Shēng Mài Mén Dōng** (生麦门冬) 4 *liǎng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草), **Máhuáng** (麻黄) each 2 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
*(Four ingredients, prepared as before.)*

If unresolved, take the **Dàhuáng Decoction**—add *xìxīn* (细辛) 5 *liǎng* if restless:
**Dàhuáng** (大黄) 3 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草) 2 *liǎng*
**Zhīzǐ Rén** (栀子仁) 20 kernels
*(Five ingredients, prepared as before; take repeatedly until defecation occurs, or finish if no effect.)*

If heat persists—evidenced by elevated gaze and thirst—take the **Guōluó Gen Decoction**:
**Guōluó Gen** (栝蒌根), **Dà Mài Nǚ** (大麦奴) each 4 *liǎng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草) 2 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
**Cōngbái** (葱白) ½ *jīn*
*(Five ingredients; take gradually, 1 *liǎng* at a time, until ~1 *shēng* is consumed, then consume a small amount of congee to aid digestion.)*

If resolved but residual heat remains in the stomach, take the **Mángxiāo Decoction**:
**Mángxiāo** (芒硝), **Guìxīn** (桂心) each 2 *liǎng*
**Tōngcǎo** (通草), **Gāncǎo** (甘草) each 3 *liǎng*
**Báizhú** (白术) 1 *liǎng*
**Dàzǎo** (大枣) 2+ pieces
**Lǐhé Rén** (李核仁) 21 kernels
*(Seven ingredients, prepared as before.)*
*If abdominal distension occurs, omit **mángxiāo** and add **rénshēn** (人参) 2 *liǎng*.*

The **Rénshēn Decoction** pairs *zǐshíyīng* (紫石英) with *rénshēn* (人参), treating the heart and liver while addressing the waist and legs. *Rénshēn* activates *zǐshíyīng*—as *Wàitái* states, *xìxīn* and *rénshēn* activating *zǐshí* causes cardiac urgency and pain, or insomnia, disorientation, memory loss, madness, drowsiness, or sudden shifts between anger and joy, alternating cold and heat, or deafness and blurred vision. Though *fángfēng* does not activate *zǐshíyīng*, *zǐshíyīng* can activate *fángfēng*; *Cháoyuán* and *Wàitái* note that while *fángfēng* does not pair with *zǐshíyīng*, it can still activate it—especially when *rénshēn* is present, as *fángfēng* activates *rénshēn*, creating a chain reaction of cardiac pain, restlessness, and neck stiffness.

At onset, take this decoction—*Wàitái* prescribes **Máhuáng Decoction**:
**Rénshēn** (人参), **Báizhú** (白朮) each 3 *liǎng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草) *(omitted in Wàitái)*
**Guìxīn** (桂心) each 2 *liǎng*
**Xìxīn** (细辛) 1 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 3 *shēng*
*(Six ingredients, prepared as before.)*
*If severe, add **dàhuáng** (大黄), **huángqín** (黄苓), **zhīzǐ** (栀子) each 3 *liǎng*.*

If memory loss or madness persists, take the **Fresh Barley Winterheath Decoction**—*Wàitái* states this treats *shí* (礜石) eruptions:
**Shēng Mài Mén Dōng** (生麦门冬), **Cōngbái** (葱白) each ½ *jīn*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草) 3 *liǎng*
**Rénshēn** (人参) 1 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
*(Five ingredients, prepared as before.)*
*Warm the bed, cover with blankets, place fire beneath, chew substances to induce slight sweating—resolution occurs within a day.*

If residual heat lingers in the heart, take the **Rénshēn Decoction**:
**Rénshēn** (人参), **Fángfēng** (防风), **Gāncǎo** (甘草) each 3 *liǎng*
**Guìxīn** (桂心) 2 *liǎng*
**Shēngjiāng** (生姜), **Báizhú** (白朮) each 1 *liǎng*
*(Six ingredients, prepared as before.)*

The **Dà Mài Rǔ Decoction** pairs *chìshízhī* (赤石脂) with *júgě* (桔梗), treating the heart while addressing the chest and back. *Júgě* activates *chìshízhī*, causing cardiac pain, cold rigidity, and limb inversion. *Chìshízhī* activates *júgě*, leading to headache, red eyes, and body heat.

At onset, warmly consume *qīngjiǔ* (清酒) as tolerated—its effects will resolve the condition. Alternatively, take this decoction:
Roast **dàmài** (大麦) until sweating, then dry. Remove husks in spring, finely grind through silk sieve, mix with cold water, and ingest. *Qiān Jīn Yì* states: parch, rinse in cold water, steam until cooked, dry under sunlight, then grind into powder.

The **Cōngbái Bèi Decoction** treats *yùshí* (誉石) without preference, addressing the stomach. Eruptions cause cardiac urgency, locked jaw, joint pain, or nodular abscesses. At onset, take this decoction—*Wàitái* prescribes **Mài Mén Dōng Decoction**:
**Cōngbái** (葱白) ½ *jīn*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
**Gāncǎo** (甘草) 2 *liǎng*
*(Three ingredients; decoct in 6 *shēng* water, reduce to 2.5 *shēng*, divide into three doses.)*

If eruptions suddenly appear across the body, take the **Fresh Barley Winterheath Decoction**:

「For the **Fresh Barley Winterheath Decoction** (生麦门冬汤):
**Fresh Barley** (生麦) 5 *liǎng*
**Winterheath** (門冬, *Mài Mén Dōng*) 3 *liǎng*
**Cinnamon Twig** (桂心, *guìxīn*) 2 *liǎng*
**Ginseng** (人參, *rénshēn*) 1.5 *liǎng*
**Cōngbái** (葱白) ½ *jīn*
**Bèi** (豉) 2 *shēng*
*(Six ingredients; decoct as per the **Unlocking the Bell and Nectar Decoction** method.)*

**Atractylodes Rhizome** (朮, *shú*) is paired with **Unlocking the Bell and Nectar** (解鐘乳). When **Atractylodes** (木, *mù*) erupts, it causes headache and eye pain, or sudden whole-body fever. Resolve it as per the **Unlocking the Bell and Nectar** method.

**Monk’shood Rhizome** (附子, *fùzǐ*) is paired with **White Stone Nectar** (白石英) and also with **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂). When **Monk’shood** erupts, it induces vomiting, hand and foot pain, body stiffness, joint soreness, or stiff neck—sometimes causing facial and ocular swelling. If it erupts after drinking wine or eating **móu** (麨), it resolves on its own. If not, treat it alongside **White Stone Nectar** (白石英).

**Ginseng** (人參) is paired with **Purple Stone Nectar** (紫石英). When **Ginseng** erupts, it causes restlessness, fever, and stiff neck. Resolve it alongside **Purple Stone Nectar** (紫石英).

**Rhubarb and Scutellaria Decoction** (大黃黃苓汤, *Dàhuáng Huánglǐn Tāng*) treats eruptions from **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂), **Poria** (茯苓), and **Oyster Shell** (牡蠣, *mǔlì*). When **Platycodon Root** (桔梗, *jiégǎng*) erupts, it causes headache, red eyes, and whole-body fever. Resolve it alongside **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂). When **Poria** (茯苓) erupts, it induces fever and restlessness. Use this decoction:
**Rhubarb** (大黃) 3 *liǎng*
**Scutellaria Root** (黃苓) 3 *liǎng*
**Gardenia Fruit** (栀子仁) 3 *liǎng*
**Bèi** (豉) 1 *shēng*
**Cōngbái** (葱白, sliced) 1 *shēng*
*(Five ingredients; chop, decoct in 6 *shēng* water, reduce to 2.5 *shēng*, divide into three doses.)*

When **Oyster Shell** (牡蠣) erupts, it causes fever in the limbs, abdominal discomfort, and intense thirst. Resolve it alongside **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂).

**Dried Ginger** (乾姜) has no specific pairing.

**Trichosanthes Root Decoction** (栝蒌根汤, *Guàluó Gēn Tāng*) treats **Sea Snail** (海蛤, *hǎihé*). When **Sea Snail** erupts first, it induces fever in the hands and feet. When **Trichosanthes** (栝蒌) erupts first, it causes locked jaw and clear nasal discharge. Use this decoction:
**Trichosanthes Root** (栝蒌根) 2 *liǎng*
**Glycyrrhiza** (甘草) 2 *liǎng*
**Rhubarb** (大黃) 1 *liǎng*
**Gardenia Fruit** (栀子仁) 14 pieces
*(Four ingredients; decoct as per the **Unlocking the Bell and Nectar** method.)*

When **White Stone Nectar** (白石英) erupts, it first causes abdominal distension, then fever.
When **Stone Sulfur** (石硫黃) erupts, it causes fever throughout the body combined with lumbar and knee pain.
When **Pumice** (礜石) erupts, it causes fever across the whole body and locked jaw.
When **Oyster Shell** (牡蠣) erupts, it causes headache and fever with restlessness.
When **Poria** (茯苓) erupts, it causes straight-up headache.
When **Platycodon Root** (桔梗) erupts, it causes fever in the head and face.
When **Sea Snail** (海蛤) erupts, it causes fever in the chest.

*(Except for **Sea Snail**, all these eruptions should be treated with bathing.)*

When **Purple Stone Nectar** (紫石英) erupts, it causes alternating chills and fever.
When **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂) erupts, it causes chest constriction, whole-body fever, and red eyes. *(Both should be treated with wine.)*

For **Stone Sulfur** (石硫黃), **Pumice** (礜石), **Platycodon Root** (桔梗), **Oyster Shell** (牡蠣), and **Poria** (茯苓), these five substances’ eruptions should be treated with bathing. **White Stone Nectar** (白石英) may also be treated with a small bath. The rest are not suitable for bathing.

When **Pumice** (礜石) erupts, use **Hot and Cold Water Decoction** (生熟汤).
When **Poria** (茯苓) erupts, the fever primarily attacks the head—wash the body with cold water and let it soak.

**Bathing Method**: Begin with warm water, then switch to cold. During bathing, avoid washing the head directly; instead, pour 2–3 *shēng* of water over it. If eruptions resolve after bathing, that is ideal. If not, further treatment may be applied.

For **Red Stone Pitch** (赤石脂) and **Purple Stone Nectar** (紫石英) eruptions, drinking wine is effective—they resolve upon consuming wine.

Not all eruptions can be treated uniformly; some require cold therapy, others wine. This is a proven method.

Another method states: If eruptions are triggered by **Cold Food Day** (寒食) and persist, it is because the **herbal qi** (草藥氣) dissipates easily, while the **stone’s nature** (石性) is slow and lingering, dominating the stomach. Thus, it causes repeated eruptions. When preparing to take the medication, place one spoonful of the powdered decoction in a silk pouch and steep it in 4 *shēng* of wine. Seal the pouch and let it sit overnight. Then drink the wine entirely.

The amount of wine used depends on the individual’s constitution and tolerance, following the old method. This approach harnesses both **herbal and mineral forces** (藥石之勢).

If the stone does not linger in the stomach, how can it erupt? This method is indeed very effective.

For those with **shortness of breath**, gradually sip small amounts frequently.

From *Thousand Gold Wings* (《千金翼》): It treats **dispersion of *qi* with reversed breathing**, excruciating abdominal pain, inability to draw breath—**a condition where life hangs by a thread**. If eruptions arise from excessive **emotional excess**, administer **Astragalus Decoction** (黄耆汤). *(Formula omitted in original.)*

If eruptions stem from **excessive cold**, **feverish heat** ensues. Bathe with cold water, then irrigate with **raw and cooked decoctions** (生熟汤) five to six *dou* at a time. Afterward, consume **slightly warm food** and **slightly heated wine**, and engage in **moderate physical exertion**.

If eruptions stem from **excessive heat**, **chest oppression** dominates, with frequent cravings for **cool foods**. If eruptions flare in **summer’s intense heat**, often due to excessive drinking, administer **water mixed with a small amount of *zhuo*** (钞). If unresolved, repeat until cured.

**Cold and Hot Moxibustion Method**: If **urination or defecation is obstructed**, or if **dribbling urine with blood** or **penile pain** occurs—these are signs of **heat-*qi***. Apply this method to cure it:
First, **warm the lower abdomen with cold objects**, then with **hot objects**, and again with **cold objects**. If urination becomes frequent, this too is from **excessive cold**; warmth will naturally restore balance.

**Formula for Diarrhea After Dispersion**:
Dry-roast **fermented soybeans** until they break apart—**the more broken, the better**.

**Betel Nut Decoction (槟榔汤)**: If **edema occurs after taking a dispersion**, it is usually from **excessive cold**. The cure:
Thirty **betel nuts**, crushed, decocted in **8 *sheng* of water**, reduced to **2 *sheng***, divided into two doses.

Slice and **soak in vinegar overnight**. Melt **1 *sheng* of pork fat**, simmer the **Phytolacca** until blackened, strain, and apply to the swelling **three times daily, once at night**.

**Formula for Dispersion-Induced Fine Ulcers**:
**Coptis (黄连)** and **Mirabilite (芒硝)** each **5 *liang***.
Chop, decoct **Coptis** in **8 *sheng* of water**, reduce to **4 *sheng***, strain, and dissolve **Mirabilite** in the liquid. Soak cloth and apply to the ulcers, changing frequently—**apply generously regardless of size**.

**Formula for Unbearable Pain in Dispersion-Induced Ulcers**:
**Cold Stone (冷石)** **3 *liang***, sifted into powder.
Dust onto the ulcer **five to six times daily**; it will dry quickly, and the pain will subside.

**Formula for Sudden Pain After Dispersion**:
**Dried Ginger (乾姜)** **5 *liang***, chopped, decocted in **5 *sheng* of water**, reduced to **3 *sheng***, strained, and mixed with **1 *ge* of honey**. Take all at once. If unresolved, repeat.

**Duckweed Decoction (鸭通汤)**: To **dissolve dispersions and clear heat**:
**Duckweed (白鸭通)** **5 *sheng***, steeped in **1.5 *dou* of boiling water**, strained to yield **2 *dou* of juice.

**Method for Forced Dispersion**: To treat **heat exhaustion from dispersions** (*Thousand Gold Wings* states): If **frequent eruptions of heat** occur without relief, **purge them**.

It also states: **All elixirs and mineral-based medicines** may be used similarly.

**Formula 1**:
**Millet (黍米)** **3 *sheng***, ground into gruel, mixed with **1 *jin* of rendered pork fat**. Take **on an empty stomach in the morning** after fasting overnight, until sated. **Evening purgation** will follow—**highly effective**. If heat persists, repeat.

**Formula 2**:
**Fat Pork (肥猪肉)** **5 *jin***, **Garlic (葱白)** and **Scallions (建)** each **½ *jin***.
Simmer together. Consume as food after fasting overnight. If unresolved, repeat the next day.

**Formula 3**: For **recurrent heat exhaustion**, **compression and purgation**:
Extract **pork kidney fat (猪肾脂)**, ensuring no water enters. Roast over fire, collecting the drippings at **lukewarm temperature**. Take **3 *ge*** per dose, **five to six times daily**, up to **five to six *sheng***.
On the second day, **gradually purge with bowel movements**.

**Formula 4**:
Prepare **1 *sheng* of pork fat gruel (猪肉臛)**, mixed as usual. Take **all at once on an empty morning stomach**. Shortly after, **abdominal rumbling** will signal purgation—**collect the expelled matter** and rinse with water to retrieve **stones**. If incomplete, repeat.

**Detoxification Formulas**
**Chapter 4: Treatment of Toxic Poisoning (蛊毒)**

**Discussion on Toxic Poisoning (蛊毒)**

The *Discourse* states: Among the myriad forms of toxic poisoning, each manifests uniquely—some expel fresh blood; others prefer seclusion in darkness, shunning light; some exhibit erratic emotions, alternating between rage and joy; others suffer heavy limbs and aching joints. Such symptoms are countless and cannot be fully enumerated. Some afflicted linger for three years before death, while others perish within months or even days. At death, the poison exits through the **orifices** or from the flesh beneath the ribs.

Thus, when venturing forth, one must carry **realgar (雄黄)**, **musk (麝香)**, and **elixir (神丹)**—these potent antidotes repel all malevolent spirits: **hundredfold curses (百蛊)**, **cat ghosts (猫鬼)**, **fox spirits (狐狸)**, and **demonic entities (老物精魅)**. Those who prioritize longevity must heed this warning.

Common folk also employ **moxibustion (灸法)**. For those afflicted with **initial or mid-stage poisoning (初中蛊)**, apply **100 moxa cones (壮)** below the heart—this also treats **cat ghosts (猫鬼)**. Additionally, apply **three moxa cones** to the tip of the **little toe**; the expelled matter will vary—**alcohol** for those poisoned via drink, **rice** for those via food, **meat or vegetables** for those via such fare. The cure is confirmed when the substance emerges from the moxa wound.

When one is poisoned, the abdomen and chest seize in agony, as if gnawed by unseen forces. Blood vomited or expelled resembles rotting flesh. If untreated, the poison corrodes the **five viscera**, leading to inevitable death.

To verify poisoning, induce the patient to spit into water. If the saliva sinks, it is **toxic poisoning (蛊)**; if it floats, it is not.

Those suffering chronic ailments who periodically pass **black stools like lacquer**, whether thick or thin, or tinged with faint red, are victims of **toxic poisoning**. Sudden blood loss, worsening after treatment with **lowering remedies (断下方)**, also signals poisoning. Likewise, **abrupt bloody dysentery**, whether red or black, in any quantity, is a sign of **toxic poisoning**. Crude physicians who treat such cases with **purgatives (断痢药)** commit grave error.

Some incompetent healers, encountering patients swollen with **toxic edema (蛊胀)**, observe that though the body is distended, the limbs remain unaffected, and urination is not excessively strained. Mistaking this for **water retention (水病)**, they prescribe diuretics for over fifty days, hoping for recovery—only for the condition to worsen fatally. Such cases are not singular. Scholars must carefully discern the **intent of the formulas**, adjusting treatment accordingly, ensuring no failure.

Though medical texts number in the thousands, their principles cannot be exhaustively detailed here.

If one is poisoned by another’s malevolent intent, and the antidote reveals the **poisoner’s name**, compel the victim to summon them away. To uncover the poisoner’s name, burn **rotten drumskin (败鼓皮)** into powder, administer **one square-inch spoonful** in drink. Swiftly, the victim will utter the poisoner’s name—command them to depart, and recovery follows.

Another method involves mixing **snake saliva (蛇涎)** into food, inducing **chronic abdominal masses (瘕病)**. These two afflictions, if untreated, prove fatal over time. Each requires distinct remedies, and such cases do occur in the **southern mountains (江南山间)**—this must not be dismissed.

In cases of **postpartum diarrhea (下痢)**, take one pill, and insert one pill into the lower abdomen.

For **toxic poisoning (蛊毒)**, take two pills. If the poison is external, apply a poultice made from the powder and massage it onto the affected area. If the poison causes vomiting above the diaphragm (**膈上吐**), it will resolve with diarrhea below the diaphragm (**膈下利**).

These four ingredients (**右四味**) treat **poisoning from snakes, toads, and dung beetles (蛊蛇、蜣蟆、蜣螂)**. Take one *qian* (钱) with water, and the toxins will be expelled.

**The Supreme Elixir of Universal Healing (万病圆)** treats **poisoning (蛊注)**, **limb edema (四肢浮肿)**, **muscle and skin atrophy (肌肤消索)**, **coughing and vomiting (咳逆)**, **abdominal distension resembling water (腹大如水状)**, and **posthumous possession of the living (死后转易家人)**—also known as the **Poisoning Distension Formula (蛊胀方)**. The *Xiaopin* (《小品》) calls it the **Realgar Pill (雄黄丸)**, while others name it the **Universal Healing Pill (万病丸)**.

**Ingredients:**
- **Realgar (雄黄)** – 4 *liang* (两)
- **Croton Seed (巴豆)** – 4 *liang*
- **Dill Herb (莽草)** – 4 *liang*
- **Ghost Rhubarb (鬼臼)** – 4 *liang*
- **Centipede (蜈蚣)** – 3 specimens

These five ingredients (**右五味**) are ground into powder, mixed with honey, and pounded three thousand times. Form pills the size of small beans (**丸如小豆**), seal them tightly to prevent loss of **qi (气)**. Avoid consuming them after they have been stored. Take one pill in the morning on an empty stomach (**平旦空腹服#3一丸**). If symptoms persist after a meal (**一炊久不知**), take another pill.

First, expect clear water (**清水**) to be expelled, followed by a long **poisonous worm (蛊长数寸)**, then a snake (**蛇**), and finally a **toad or white toxic residue resembling grease (赌鹦子或白如膏)**. Afterward, consume a porridge of scallions and fermented soybean paste (**葱豉粥**) to restore vitality, and maintain warmth while resting (**百种暖将息**).

For **severe internal poisoning (治中蛊毒)**, where the abdomen is hard as stone (**腹内坚如石**), the face turns greenish-yellow (**面目青黄**), and urination is difficult (**小便淋沥**), with symptoms shifting unpredictably (**病变无常处**), the *Zhouhou* (《肘后》) and *Gujin Luyan Fang* (《古今录验方》) both prescribe a pill made from **Iron Filings (铁精)** and **Black Chicken Liver (乌鸡肝)**, the size of a *wúzi* (梧子) fruit. Take with wine, three pills daily, twice a day (**以酒服三丸，日再**). Even the most severe cases will not exceed ten days of treatment.

*The Qianjin* (《千金》) records a later formula, but its authenticity is doubted—perhaps an error in *Qianjin* (《千金》).*」*

The **Sheep-Skin Decoction** (*羖羊皮方*)—five inches long—with **rhinoceros horn**, **peony**, **coptis**, and **peony root** each one *liang*, **dried hollyhock** four and a half *liang*, and **gardenia fruit** seven kernels. These seven ingredients, finely chopped, are decocted in nine *sheng* of water, reduced to three *sheng*, and taken in three divided doses. The formulas of **Ge Shi** and **Cui Shi** are identical, omitting peony, peony root, and gardenia, instead using **sophora root**, **cimicifuga**, and **angelica root**.

For **rhinoceros horn** (when round), treating **poisoning by sorcery (蛊毒)**, all manner of illnesses, sudden abdominal pain, **flying corpse (飞尸)** foul miasma, and swelling: **powdered rhinoceros horn**, **aconite root** (ghostly), **cinnamon bark** (finely ground), and **antelope horn** (powdered) each four *qian* (in a *shi* measure), **cantharis**, **imperata**, **true pearl**, and **realgar** each one *liang*, **mother-of-pearl** (five pieces, burned), **centipede** (five segments), **croton seed** (fifty pieces), and **musk** (two *fen*.) One **arrowhead** (*射罔*) the size of a chicken yolk. These thirteen ingredients are ground into a powder, kneaded together, and formed into pills the size of small beans with honey.

Take one pill daily, twice a day, dissolving it in the mouth before swallowing. If no effect is seen, gradually increase the dose.

Sudden abdominal distension and **flying corpse** (*fēishī*)—take two pills the size of large beans.
If foul miasma and swelling occur, mix with bitter wine and apply as a poultice.
Sew a pouch to hold the medicine and tie it to the left arm to ward off malevolent ghosts, **spirit ailments**, and **poisonous influences**—this can be used in emergencies.

**Formula for Treating Poisonous Influences (*wùdú*):**
**Rubia root** and **lotus root**—each three *liang*.
These two ingredients, [coarsely] chopped, are boiled in four *sheng* of water, reduced to two *sheng*, and taken at once.

*The [Zhǒuhòu] Prescriptions* state:
For **poisonous influence** entering the body causing blood to be vomited or passed as if rotting liver—if one knows the name of the **poisonous influence’s** master—

Another formula:
**Cinnabar bark ash** and **tangled hair ash**—each one *cùn* measure.
**Sesame seed juice**—five *sheng*.
**White bark from the northern shade of the *lǎoshù* tree** and **peach root bark**—each five *liang*.
These five ingredients: first boil the **cinnabar bark** and **peach root**, extracting a concentrated decoction of one *sheng*, then mix with the sesame juice and ashes until uniform.
The afflicted person should eat lightly the night before. At dawn, take one large *sheng*, then immediately place a basin of water nearby and use a chicken feather to induce vomiting into the water, causing the **cow’s saliva**, **calf’s fetus**, and all parasites to emerge.

Another formula:
A large handful of **white bark from the northern shade of the *huìshù* tree**—five *cùn* long—boiled in three *sheng* of water, reduced to one *sheng*, taken on an empty stomach, which will immediately induce vomiting of the parasites.
This also treats **poisonous influence** causing blood to be passed.

Another formula:
Take one *cùn* measure of **cinnabar bark ash** dissolved in water—this also expels the parasites.

Another formula:
**Great bindweed** and **spotted cat**—each one *fēn*.

On the fifth day of the fifth month, the *Bìxiào Fāng* states:
Take the eastern-facing bark of the *táobái* (peach tree), toasted by fire—each portion four *fēn*. These three ingredients treat **downward-sifting** (a parasitic disorder).
At dawn, on an empty stomach, take one *jīzǐ* (egg-sized) measure of water with eight *niǎn* (thread-like doses) of the powdered mixture. Pinch the medicine between two fingers as if opening a gap, then swallow it at once.
If the fingers are too far apart, the dose will be too large and may harm the patient.

The *Zhǒuhòu Fāng* states: Take a dose the size of a date pit. If not cured in ten days, repeat.
The *Bìxiào Fāng* states: Take half a *fāngcùn* dose. The poison will immediately emerge; if not, take another dose.

Li Ráozhōu says: If the poisoning came from alcohol, serve the medicine with alcohol; if from food, serve it with water.

**Treatment for Snake Snare (Snake Poison in Food):**
When snake venom enters vegetables or fruit, consuming it causes illness—known as **snake snare**.
Grind yellow soybeans into a powder, soak in alcohol, and strain the liquid. Take half a *shēng*.

**Treatment for Heat Poison or Snare Poison Causing Nosebleed or Blood from the Mouth (When Doctors Fail):**
Burn seven human fecal pellets until they turn fiery red, then grind them in water and take at once—immediate cure.
This also resolves all poisons, seasonal heat diseases, and their toxins—proven highly effective.

**Treatment for Snare-Induced Vomiting and Blood Loss:**
- **Bìpí (Betula skin):** five *cùn* wide, one *chǐ* long
- **Lǔdí root:** five *cùn* long, like a big toe
(*Xiǎopǐn Fāng* uses *qiángwēi* root)
These two ingredients, chopped, are boiled in two *shēng* of water, reduced to one *shēng*, and taken at once—forcefully expelling the snare.

**Treatment for Snare-Induced Blood Loss (Occurring Tens of Times Daily):**
- **Bādòu (Croton seeds):** 14 seeds
- **Yuánqīng (Mercuric sulfide)**
- **Lílú (Helleborus)**
- **Fúzǐ (Aconite)**
- **Fánshí (Alum stone)**
Each two *fēn*—five ingredients total.
Grind into powder, separately process the *bādòu*, sift, and mix evenly.
Wrap the medicine in cotton like a large soybean and insert into the rectum three times daily until cured.

Another formula:
Boil one **kǔhuāng (bitter gourd)** in two *shēng* of water, reducing to one *shēng*, and take gradually.
It will expel the snare and induce vomiting of toads and tadpoles—fully effective in a month.
*Fàn Wāng Fāng* warns: The toxicity of bitter gourd must be measured carefully.
*Zhǒuhòu Fāng* instructs: Boil in one *shēng* of sour wine.

**Treatment for Blood Loss Resembling Chicken Liver with Unbearable Abdominal Pain:**
- **Qiàn gēn (Rubia root):** 3 *liǎng*
- **Shēngmá (Cimicifuga rhizome):** 3 *liǎng*

- **Dìyú (Sanguisorba root):** 4 *liǎng*
- **Báizhěhé (White pond lily rhizome):** 4 *liǎng*
Eight ingredients, chopped, boiled in nine *shēng* of water, reduced to 2.5 *shēng*, divided into three doses.
This formula promotes blood flow to dispel the snare.

Another formula:
- **Júgēng (Platycodon root)**
- **Xījiǎo (Rhinoceros horn)**
Equal parts, ground into powder. Take one *fāngcùn* dose in wine, three times daily.
If the patient cannot swallow, crush the powder into the mouth. The medicine will cause internal agitation, which will soon subside, followed by expulsion. Continue for seven days.
Afterward, eat pig spleen to restore vitality.

This treats snare-induced blood loss resembling chicken liver, even in fatal cases.

**Treatment for Intestinal Snare (First expelling red, then yellow-white froth, with chronic illness lasting years):**
Pound one *liǎng* of **niúxī (Achyranthes root)** into a powder, slice, and soak in one *shēng* of clear, pure wine overnight.
Take on an empty stomach at dawn. A second dose ensures cure.

**Northern Region Governor’s Wine (Treats All Snare Poisons, Wind, Cold, Heat, and Seasonal Illnesses):**

Thirteen ingredients.
Ferment with seven *jīn* of *qū* (malt) and one *hú* (bushel) of *júmǐ* (millet) using wine-making methods. Chop the medicine, place in a silk pouch, and submerge at the bottom of the jar.
When the wine is ready, remove the dregs, place the medicine residue in a green cloth pouch, and submerge it again in the wine. Seal with mud. Store for seven days in autumn, five in summer, or ten in winter.
Take one *hé* (cup) on an empty stomach, three times daily, until the illness manifests.
The medicine is toxic, so it must be stored in green cloth.
Do not interrupt treatment. Within twenty days, the illness will surface like black lacquer; by fifty days, all ailments will be cured.

A case: A fifty-year-old woman suffered chronic abdominal masses, alternating cold and heat, constant cutting pain around the navel, and chest fullness from shortness of breath for over twenty years. After taking the medicine for two weeks, she expelled three to four *shēng* of blood and was cured.

Another case: A woman with postpartum paralysis took the medicine for twenty days, vomiting a black mass like a sword belt, three *chǐ* long, and was cured, giving birth that year.

Another case: A woman with epilepsy took the medicine for eighteen days, expelling two and a half *shēng* of blood and recovering.

A man beaten with a rod suffered internal blood stagnation and lay paralyzed for nine years. After thirteen days of the medicine, he expelled two to three *shēng* of black blood and recovered.

A man deaf for seventeen years took the medicine for thirty-five days, expelling three *shēng* of blood from his nose and five *shēng* of yellow fluid from his ears, and was cured.

An ancient text records: This formula was submitted by Governor Guāng of the Northern Region in the *Xīpíng* era (172–178 CE).

Though primarily for snare poisons, it cures all cases without fail. Even the most stubborn illnesses resolve within two weeks, and all symptoms manifest fully.

A woman in her forties suffered paralysis, emaciation, and deafness for three years, unable to rise. After I prescribed this, she fully recovered.

A man with snare poisoning complicated by wind took excessive *yīnyù* (a medicinal wine), vomiting dozens of snare parasites and recovering. How much more effective is this wine in expelling snare poisons!

Its extraordinary efficacy surpasses all other formulas, hence its detailed record.

**Chapter Five: Treatment for Barrel Stench and Armpit Discharge**

**Chapter Five: Treatise on Barrel Stench and Armpit Discharge**

The Treatise states: Some are born with the **Barrel Stench** (*Húxiù*), while others acquire it from external sources. Those born with it are difficult to treat, but those who acquire it are easier to cure. Still, it requires three years of applying vinegar and **alum-cinnabar powder** (*fǔ fánshí sǎn*) without interruption, and the concurrent ingestion of the **Five Aromatic Pill** (*Wǔxiāng wán*), only then may one achieve lasting recovery. Do not claim that a single application of the medicine will suffice—that would merely bring temporary relief, not a cure. The **Five Aromatic Pill** is documented in the preceding **Volume Six**.

In general, those afflicted with **Barrel Stench** must avoid **Chinese cabbage** (*yúnwèi*) and the **Five Pungent** (*Wǔxīn*) foods for life; if they do not, the condition will never be cured.

**Formula for Lime Powder to Treat Barrel Stench**:
Quicklime (*shíhuā*) – 1 *shēng*
Cinnamomum camphora (*fēngxiāng*, alternatively **Sandalwood** *chénxiāng*)
Cloves (*dīngxiāng*)
**Aloeswood** (*xūnlùxiāng*)
**Greenheart Wood** (*qīngmùxiāng*) – each 2 *liǎng*
**Alum** (*fánshí*) – 4 *liǎng*
**Tangerine Peel** (*júpí*)
**Cordyolite** (*yángqǐshí*) – each 3 *liǎng*

These eight ingredients are used to treat **Barrel Stench**. Take cotton to form a **tampon-like applicator** (*zhuànzi*), roughly the thickness of a finger and four inches long. Spread the medicine onto it, then place it inside a silk pouch and affix it under the armpit. First, rub the area with cloth until it aches, then secure the pouch.

Another formula:

「For **Barrel Stench**, if the condition persists after three years, apply a mixture of vinegar (*kǔzú*) and quicklime (*shíhuā*) to the affected area.

**Formula for Barrel Stench**:

**Aconite** (*fùzǐ*)
**Quicklime** (*báihuī*, alternatively **Unslaked lime**) – each 2 *liǎng*
**Alum** (*fánshí*) – ½ *liǎng*
These four ingredients are to be made into a powder and mixed with rice flour (*fěnzhōng*). Apply the mixture regularly.

The *Zhǒuhòu* [medical text] omits **Alum**.

Another formula:
Finely shred **Red Copper** (*chìtóng*), mix with vinegar (*zú*), and parch in a silver vessel until extremely hot. Wrap the copper in cloth and press it against the armpit. Once cooled, replace with a fresh hot application.

Another formula:
Cut **Chinese Hackberry Leaves** (*guìyè*) into three *shēng*, boil with five *shēng* of water until reduced to one *shēng*. Use the decoction to wash the armpit. Then, burn **White Bitter Gourd** (*báikǔhúluó*) to produce smoke and apply it to the armpit. Repeat this treatment frequently.

Another formula:
**Magnolia Flower** (*xīnyí*) – 4 parts
**Asarum** (*xìxīn*)
**Ligusticum** (*chōuxiōng*)
**Greenheart Wood** (*qīngmùxiāng*) – each 4 parts
These four ingredients are to be finely ground and applied as a powder to the armpit, then mixed with rice flour (*fěnzhōng*) and applied regularly.

Another formula:
**Beef Tallow** (*niúpí*) and **Barite** (*húfěn*) – equal parts
These two ingredients are boiled until they can be formed into pills. Apply the pills to the armpit; the condition will be cured after one night. No more than three doses are needed.

The *Zhǒuhòu Fāng* [medical text] states that **Black Pepper** (*biāojiāo*) can be added to the mixture for application.

Another formula:
Apply a paste made from **Fossilized Dragon Liver** (*fúlónggān*).」

**Six-Ingredient Powder** for *Lòuè* (persistent axillary sweating and malodor) affecting the armpits, soles, palms, groin, and perineum:

**Barite** (*húfěn*)
**Talc** (*huáshí*) – each 1 *liǎng*

Sift the ingredients finely, mix with a small amount of *kǔjiǔ* (sour wine), and apply as a powder. A slight sweat will emerge; change clothing and reapply. The condition will resolve within three applications, though it may recur annually—reapply upon recurrence.

---
Another formula:
**Mercury** (*shuǐyín*)
**Barite** (*húfěn*) – *Wàihuà* (External Painting) reads *fěnshuāng* (powder frost)

Mix thoroughly, place in a silk pouch, and dust on when sweating occurs. Miraculous efficacy.

---
Another formula:
Wash the armpits with urine on the first day of the month. Divine efficacy.

---
Another formula:
Burn **Alum Stone** (*huángfánshí*) until the liquid evaporates, grind into powder, place in a silk pouch, and dust on. The condition will resolve immediately.

---
**Sixth Formula for Prolapsed Rectum (Tuōgāng)**

**Discussion on Moxibustion and Acupuncture** (*Yīntòng dìbā lùn*)—**Formula #21**:
There are four types of **swelling** (*zhǒng*), including **intestinal obstruction** (*chángzhǒng*), **testicular distension** (*luǎnzhàng*), **gas-related distension** (*qìzhǒng*), and **fluid-related distension** (*shuǐzhǒng*). **Intestinal obstruction** and **testicular distension** are difficult to cure, while **gas-related distension** and **fluid-related distension** respond well to acupuncture and moxibustion.

**Formula for Treating Distension** (*Zhìzhǒngyuán fāng*):
**Peach Kernel** (*táorén*)—5+ *en*, **Spider** (*zhīzhū*)—5+ *en*, **Cinnamon Bark** (*guìxīn*)—2 *liǎng*, **Gallardia Fruit** (*jílí zǐ*)—2 *liǎng*, **Groundnut** (*dìfū zǐ*)—2 *liǎng*, **Alisma Rhizome** (*zéxiè*)—2 *liǎng*, **Siler Root** (*fángfēng*)—2 *liǎng*, **Schisandra Berry** (*wǔwèizǐ*)—2 *liǎng*, **Tangerine Peel** (*jú pí*)—2 *liǎng*, **Poria** (*fúlíng*)—2 *liǎng*, **Cnidium Rhizome** (*fángkuí*)—2 *liǎng*, **Peony Root** (*sháo yào*)—2 *liǎng*, **Moutan Bark** (*mǔdān pí*)—1 *liǎng*, **Asarum Rhizome** (*xìxīn*)—1 *liǎng*, **Seaweed** (*hǎizǎo*)—1 *liǎng*, **Vulpes Vulgaris** (*húyīn*)—1 whole specimen.

**Formula for Treating [□] Hernia with Asymmetrical Testicular Distension** (*Zhì [□]shàn luǎn piāndà, qìshàng-shàng yīzuòzhàng bùnéngdòng fāng*):
**Moutan Bark** (*mǔdān pí*)—2 *liǎng*, **Siler Root** (*fángfēng*)—2 *liǎng*.

The two ingredients are used to treat **lower abdominal distension** (*xià shāi*), taken with wine in doses of one *fǐncùn* *bì* (a small spoonful), three times daily.

**From *Zhǒuhòu Fāng* it states:**
*The Small Brand Formulas* use **Cinnamon Heart** (*guìxīn*), **Fermented Soybeans** (*shǐ*), and **Iron Filings** (*tiějīng*), each in equal parts—five ingredients in total. For children, administer one *dāo guī* (a small dose), and the condition will heal in twenty days. For infants, mix with breastmilk and give a small amount the size of a **mung bean**.

**Treatment for Sudden [□] Hernia:**
Take **reed** (*pú*), fold it horizontally across the mouth like a broad belt, then double its length. Place it over the lower abdomen at the **Great Horizontal Mark** (*dà héngwén*), ensuring it aligns centrally above the navel—do not let it tilt. Moxibustion is applied at the head of the reed and the central junction (two points), adjusting the number of *zhàng* (moxa cones) by age and strength.

**Post-Treatment Care:**
Avoid heavy lifting, loud speech, anger, or excessive laughter. Additionally:
- Pull the **scrotum upward** and moxibustion at the **extreme apex of the penis**.
- Pull downward toward the **anus**, then moxibustion at the extreme apex.
- Pull laterally toward the **hips**, moxibustion at the extreme apex of the penis—adjust *zhàng* by age and strength.
- Moxibustion at **Foot Jueyin** (Liver channel), alternating sides (left moxa on right, right on left), three *zhàng* each, located between the **big toe’s proximal joint**.
- For **asymmetrical testicular distension** rising into the abdomen, moxibustion at **Sanyinjiao** (SP6), eight *cùn* above the inner ankle, adjusting *zhàng* by age and strength.

- For **asymmetrical scrotal distension** in males, moxibustion at **Guānyuán** (RN4), one hundred *zhàng*.
- For **male scrotal distension** with [□] disease, moxibustion at **Yùquán** (KI5), one hundred *zhàng* (three sessions). The point lies below the **bent bone** (pubic symphysis) in the inguinal region, often neglected due to its low position. **Quānyīn** (a variant point) is also external to this area.
- For **male asymmetrical scrotal distension** with [□] disease, moxibustion at **Quānyīn**, one hundred *zhàng* (three sessions), located beside the **horizontal bone** (pubis).
- For **sudden scrotal swelling** with **testicular obstruction**, have the patient press both feet together, aligning the **big toes** so their nails touch. Apply moxibustion at the **corners of the toenails**—place one full cone (*wán*) on top and half-cones at each corner. The upper toe’s corner is optimal; seven *zhàng* will cure it.

**For Male Scrotal Distension with Epileptic Symptoms (#24):**
Moxibustion at **Foot Taiyang** (Bladder channel), fifty *zhàng* (three sessions).
Alternatively, moxibustion at **Foot Taiyin** (Spleen channel), fifty *zhàng*, one *fǔ* (span) above the inner ankle.

- Moxibustion at both sides of the **horizontal bone** (pubis), fourteen *zhàng* (two sets of seven), beside the penis.
- For **scrotal [□] hernia**, moxibustion at **Lǐzhōng** (ST45), ten *zhàng*, applied along the swollen edge.
*From Zhǒuhòu Fāng*: Moxibustion at the **second joint of the big toe**, five *zhàng*, at the center of the horizontal crease.
*Yaò Shì* states: Moxibustion at the **base of the big toe**, three *zhàng*.

**For Male [□] Hernia (Ritual Method):**
First, hold the child firmly by the **occiput**, then recite:
*"I command this child, [Name], to cease his scrotal [□] hernia. Thus, I moxa him with three sets of seven—twenty-one cones total."*
After moxibustion, pull the child’s **penis downward** so the **glans points toward the scrotal seam**, then moxibustion at the seam’s apex (seven *zhàng*). This will resolve it—**verified effective**.
Use **pig-bristle moxa cones** the size of a **hairpin head**.

**General Treatment for Male [□] Hernia:**
Have the patient **straddle a pestle’s axle**, extending the penis over it so the **glans aligns with the axle’s front edge**. Moxibustion is applied to the **wooden axle**, adjusting *zhàng* by age and strength.

**Discussion:**
Some men, from youth to old age, suffer **chronic dry eczema** (*gānxiàn*) in the scrotum—treat with **eczema formulas**.
Those with **Five Strains and Seven Injuries** (*wǔláo qīshāng*) developing **scrotal itching and dampness**, exuding yellow fluid when scratched, should take **tonifying pills/powders** and apply topical remedies.
Some suffer **Jìjīng Canker** (*jìjīngchuāng*), treated with **Precision Essence Decoction**.
**Jìjīng Canker** appears in men below the **penile glans** and in women within the **vulva**, resembling **sweet canker** (*gānchuāng*). It causes **excruciating pain when eating glutinous rice**, but pain subsides if **millet** is consumed instead.

**Xìlìzi Decoction** treats:
- General **heat from deficiency** (*xū rè*)
- **Stone-induced heat** (*shí rè*)

*From Sun Simiao’s* **Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies**, *Volume 74.*

**Emergency Prescriptions for Sudden Death**

**First Method for Sudden Death (Cessation of Breath)**
*Moxibustion Therapy*
Sudden death with no pulse, no other signs—this is due to exhaustion of both **yin** and **yang**. Treatment:
Draw a cow to lick the patient’s nose for **two hundred breaths**—the cow’s licking will surely cure them.
If the cow refuses to lick, smear **salt brine** on the patient’s face, and the cow will comply.

Alternative Method:
Squeeze fresh cow or horse dung to extract the juice and administer it orally. If fresh dung is unavailable, dry dung mixed with water is also effective.
*The **Zhǒuhòu Prescriptions** state:* Dry dung should be dissolved in human urine—this is **Bian Que’s** method.

Alternative Method:
Use a heated **iron cautery moxibustion tool** to warm the patient’s flanks.

*The **Emergency Prescriptions** also state:* This also treats **corpse-like collapse** (*shījué*).

*Acupressure & Moxibustion Therapy:*
Needle the **intercostal spaces** (*jiànshì*)—each point for **over a hundred breaths**.
Alternatively, moxibustion at the **subnasal acupuncture point** (*rénzhōng*), also called **Ghost Guest Hall** (*guìkètīng*).
*The **Zhǒuhòu Prescriptions** also state:* This also treats **corpse-like collapse**.

**Treatment for Sudden Nightmare Death (Unconsciousness)**
Keep lights dim; avoid letting anyone touch the patient. Draw a cow to stand over them—they will awaken.
If they remain unable to speak, grind **bluestem millet** (*dōngmén shàng yīngtóu*) into powder and administer with wine.

**Treatment for Sudden Nightmare Death**
Crush **garlic juice** and drip it into the nostrils. For severe cases, also drip into the ears.
**Zhang Zhongjing** states: Drip into the mouth instead.

**Treatment for Ghostly Nightmare (Unresponsiveness)**
Grind **Coptis** (*fúlóng gān*) into powder and blow into the nostrils.
Alternative Method:
Grind **soapberry pods** (*zàojiá*) into powder the size of a large soybean, then blow into the nostrils. If they sneeze, **qi** will flow, and the patient will revive—even from death.
*The **Collected Verified Prescriptions** state:* This also treats **evil possession** (*zhòng’é*).

**Warding Off Nightmares**
Take a **realgar** (*xiōnghuáng*) pill the size of a date and strike it under the **left armpit**—this will prevent nightmares for life.
**Zhang Wenzhong** specifies: For men, strike the left; for women, strike the right.

Alternative Method:

「Moxibustion of the clusters of hair on both **great toes** (*dàzhǐ cóngmáo*)—twenty-one **cauterizations** (*zhú*) each—cures the condition.

**Treatment for Sudden Unresponsiveness (*cùxìng*)**
This condition is what people today call **evil possession** (*zhòng’é*), akin to sudden death (*cùsǐ*) and **ghostly assault** (*guǐjī*). All are treated similarly—selectively apply the following methods.
Eight *ge* of salt (*yán*), with three *sheng* of water (*shuǐ*), boiled down to one and a half *sheng*—divide into two doses. If **vomiting** (*tù*) occurs, the condition is cured.
*The **Compendium of Emergency Remedies** (*Bèijí Fāng*) states:* This also treats **ghostly assault** (*guǐjī*).

If **urination** (*niǎobian*) is blocked, burn **seven *bèi* of pen heads** (*bǐtóu*) into ash (*huī*), mix with water (*shuǐ*), and take—**urination** (*niǎo*) will pass.

**Treatment for Ghostly Assault Disease (*guǐjī bìng*)**
The disease of **ghostly assault** (*guǐjī*) arises suddenly (*wújiàn*), striking the person like a blade (*rú dāo cì zhuàng*), causing **twisting pain** (*jiǎojí qǐngjí*) in the chest, sides, and abdomen. The pain cannot be suppressed by pressure (*bùkě yì’àn*), or the patient may immediately **vomit blood** (*yìtùxuè*), or blood may flow from the nose and mouth (*bìkǒu xuèchū*), or from the rectum (*xià xuè*). Another name for this is **Ghostly Convulsion** (*guǐpái*).

Once water drains completely, revival follows. Replenish the fire as needed. Continuously check the steamer and the body to prevent excessive heat—ensure warmth reaches the chest and feet. If no steamer is available, carve the ground like one, leaving space beneath like a furnace, and apply heat similarly. A cart wheel (*chēgǔ*) may also suffice. Ensure the abdomen is exposed, the head lowered, and water expelled.

Pack the body with several *hú* of warm ash, replacing it when dampened with fresh warmth.

Bend the drowned person’s legs onto the shoulders of a living person, back-to-back, and carry them while walking—water will expel, and revival follows.

**Alternative Prescriptions:**
Remove the drowned person’s clothing and cauterize the navel. Even after a night submerged, revival remains possible.

---
**Reviving from Winter Drowning (冬月落水):**
If limbs stiffen, the mouth clamps shut, but faint *qi* remains, pack warm furnace ash into a pouch and apply it thinly to the chest—replace when cooled.

**Discussion on Scorpion-Like Beetle (*móliè* 蠼螋) Urine Stings:**
The **scorpion-like beetle** (*móliè* 蠼螋) and its kind, when their urine touches a person’s shadow, cause sores at the contact site. The symptoms appear as sudden sharp pains like needles pricking the flesh, or as fine **boils** (*pǔ* 肺, *yáng* 疡) clustering like **schisandra berries** (*zhūyú* 茱萸子), with red edges and white pus at the center like **glutinous millet** (*zhūshú* 粟). They also cause skin irritation, body chills, and feverish spasms (*zhàngrè* 热壮), with severe cases spreading to the waist, ribs, and chest.

**Treatment Method:**
Upon first contact, grind **rhinoceros horn** (*xījiǎo* 犀角) and apply.
To stop the venom, treat as for **fire poison** (*huǒdān* 火丹).

In my case, during the **Wǔdé** (武德, reign period of Emperor Yang of Sui) in the sixth month, I contracted this illness. After five or six days, I felt a dull, heavy discomfort, but other treatments failed to cure it. Another person suggested drawing a **scorpion-like beetle** (*móliè* 蠼螋) shape on the ground, then carefully collecting the soil from its abdomen with a knife, mixing it with saliva into mud, and applying—repeating the application would heal it. Only then did I realize that all things in heaven and earth respond to each other in ways beyond understanding.

**For Treating Scorpion-Like Beetle (*móliè* 蠼螋) Urine Stings:**

**For Treating Three Types of *Shègōng* (射工, "Arrow-Worker") Poisonous Beetle Stings:**
**Discussion:** In the south of the Yangtze River, there is a poisonous beetle called the *Shègōng* (射工), also known as the **short fox** (*duǎnhú* 短狐) or **silkworm moth** (*’àn* 蜮). Its shape resembles a **shell beetle** (*jiǎchóng* 甲虫).
*The Outer Canon* (*Wàitái* 外台) states: It is entirely black, like a **large flying insect** (*dàfēishēng* 大飞生). It has a long horn on its face like a **crossbow** (*nú* 弩), with a curved tip resembling the upper part of a crossbow. It uses its **qi** (*qì* 气) as an arrow, shooting people with the aid of water currents. When people hear its hissing sound in water, they must avoid submerging its mouth—otherwise, it will shoot them.

This beetle fears **geese** (*é* 鹅), which can eat it. The initial symptoms include sudden chills and shivering (*jǐn* 噤, *sǒu* 瘆), followed by alternating chills and fever with muscle spasms (*jīnjí* 筋急), resembling **injury by cold** (*shānghán* 伤寒) or **corpse poison** (*zhòngshī* 中尸), rendering speech impossible. By morning, the fever subsides slightly, but by evening, it worsens. The patient suffers from **chills and fever** (*hánrè* 寒热) and **dull, chaotic discomfort** (*mènluàn* 闷乱)—these are its symptoms.

If untreated within three or four days, the patient will die by the seventh day. Initially, no sores appear, but the patient experiences sudden chills and shivering. Once sores form, they resemble those caused by the **scorpion-like beetle’s urine** (*móliè rèn* 蠼螋屎) or **anthrax-like boils** (*biāojú* 瘭疽疮). The *Shègōng* (射工) stings produce three types of sores:
One type is a **black sore** (*zhènghēi* 正黑) like **indigo dye** (*dàizǐ* 黛子), with red skin around it. If clothing touches it, the pain is like being pricked by a needle.
Another type forms a sore that gradually **ulcerates** (*chuān* 穿), often accompanied by **evening chills and fever** (*wǔjiān hánrè* 晡间寒热).
The third type resembles **burning blisters** (*huǒzhuó* 火灼), rising like **scorched skin** (*fèng* 熛). This is the most severe, killing people within days.
*The Preparedness Prescriptions* (*Bèijí Fāng* 备急方) states there are four types, one of which **suddenly erupts** (*tūqǐ* 突起) like a **carbuncle** (*yōng* 痈).

**For Treating *Shègōng* (射工) Stings with Chills and Fever, or Sores Appearing in Unusual Places:**
Take **one handful** (*yībǎ* 一把) of **ghost plant leaves** (*guǐjiǎo yè* 鬼臼叶), pound them thoroughly in **sour wine** (*kǔjiǔ* 苦酒), strain the liquid, and take **one *shāng*** (*yī shāng* 一升) daily, three times.
Another: Take **one handful** (*yī wò* 一握) of fresh **schisandra stems and leaves** (*wúzhūyú jīngyè* 吴茱萸茎叶), remove the front and back portions, and pound the middle thoroughly. Boil in **two *shāng*** (*èr shāng* 二升) of water, reducing to **seven *hé*** (*qǔ qī hé* 取七合), and take all at once.
Another: Cut **gourd** (*húluó* 葫), apply to the sore, and **moxibust** (*jiǔ* 灸) seven times.
Another: Take **one large centipede** (*yī é mǒngyǐng* 一枚蜈蚣), toast it over fire, grind into powder, mix with **sour wine** (*kǔjiǔ* 苦酒), and apply to the sore.

Another: **Cang Er Zi** (*shèngmá* 升麻) three *liǎng* (两), **rhinoceros horn** (*xījiǎo* 犀角), and **black cohosh root** (*wūshāngēn* 乌扇根) each two *liǎng* (两). Chop finely, boil in **four *shāng*** (*sì shāng* 四升) of water, reducing to **one and a half *shāng*** (*yī shāng bàn* 一升半), strain, and take in two doses, with each dose spaced by the time it takes to cook a meal (*rú yī chuī qǐng* 如一炊顷), repeating until fully recovered.

**For Treating *Shègōng* (射工) Stings When Sores Have Already Appeared:**
Mash **mustard seeds** (*jièzi* 芥子), mix with **sour wine** (*kǔjiǔ* 苦酒), and thickly apply to the sore. After half a day, the pain will cease.

「Another remedy: Take **wolfsbane leaves** (*lángyá yè* 狼牙叶), and in winter, take its **roots** (*gēn* 根). Pound them until they are thoroughly mashed, thinly apply to the affected area, and also drink **four or five *hé* (合)** of the juice.

Further, apply **egg white** (*jīzǐbái* 鸡子白) mixed with the powder to the swollen area; if it dries, reapply.

**Wild Pueraria Paste (Yěgě Gāo, 野葛膏)** for treating *Shègōng* (射工) stings, **malignant nodules** (*èhé* 恶核), and **sudden toxic attacks** (*cúzhòng èdú* 卒中恶毒):
**Wild Pueraria** (*yěgě* 野葛) one *shāng* (升), **croton seed** (*bādòu* 巴豆), **black aconite root** (*wūtóu* 乌头), **Sichuan peppercorn** (*shùjiāo* 蜀椒) each five *hé* (合), **Colocasia root** (*yīnyù* 茵芋), **Corydalis tuber** (*zhízhú* 踯躅), **processed aconite** (*fùzǐ* 附子), **cinnabar** (*dānshā* 丹砂) each two *liǎng* (两), **realgar** (*xiónghuáng* 雄黄), **rhubarb** (*dàhuáng* 大黄) each seven *liǎng* (两). The ten ingredients above are used to treat **poisonous stings** (*shègōng dú* 射工毒) and **malignant nodules** (*èhé* 恶核). Boil **three *jīn* (斤)** of **unboiled pork fat** (*bùzhōngshuǐ zhūgāo* 不中水猪膏) until it has been **three times raised and lowered** (*sānshàng sānxià* 三上三下), strain, and add **cinnabar** (*dānshā* 丹砂) and **realgar** (*xiónghuáng* 雄黄) powder, stirring until it congeals. Apply by rubbing with **jujube pits** (*zǎohé* 枣核) over the painful area; avoid proximity to the eyes.

In general, for any paste named **Gāo** (膏), ensure that **pregnant women, menstruating women, children, poultry, and livestock** do not come into contact with it. It should only be used in clean environments.

**For Treating Sand Flea Toxins:**
Take **two spotted cats** (*bān māo* 斑猫). One is **parched** (*áo* 熬), ground into powder, and ingested. The other, a large one, is **burned** (*shāo* 烧) until the smoke ceases, then ground into powder and applied to the sore.

Another remedy: Take **ten garlic cloves** (*dàsuàn* 大蒜), remove one, and mix the remaining nine with **hot ash from a heated hide** (*ānré huòguī huīhuā* 合皮安热灰). Heat them in a **parching process** (*páo* 炮), remove the skins, chop the garlic heads with a knife, and apply the hot mixture to the affected area.

**For Treating Leech Stings:**
When **stone leeches** (*shànzhì* 石蛭) from **mountain streams** (*shānshuǐ* 山水) cling to **moist grass and plants** (*yīnshī cǎomù* 阴湿草木) and bite into human flesh, they burrow into the skin, moving through the muscles, causing **progressive swelling** (*jìnyīn fénqǐ* 浸淫坟起) like the path of a worm. When traveling through mountain paths or grassy areas, always mix **pork fat from December** (*làyuè zhūgāo* 腊月猪膏) with **alkali solution** (*guàn* 盥) and apply it to the **ankles** (*jīng* 经), **toes** (*zúzhǐ* 足趾), and **calves** (*bèishang* 趺上). Also, apply it to **shoes and socks** (*xié wà* 鞋袜). This will prevent the leeches from attaching to the person. If already attached, **moxibustion** (*jiǔ* 灸) can be used to block their path, and the condition will be cured.

**For Treating Water Toxins:**
It is said: In general, **poisonous aquatic creatures** (*shuǐ dúchóng* 水毒虫) exist in mountain streams. When a person wades through water, they are stung in a manner similar to *Shègōng* (射工), yet without visible marks.

The diagnostic method is as follows: Initially, the patient will feel **severe cold** (*èhán* 恶寒), with **slight headache** (*wēi sì tóutòng* 微似头痛), **pain around the eye sockets** (*mùkuàng téng* 目眶疼), **internal agitation** (*xīnzhōng fán’ào* 心中烦懊), **tremors and shivering** (*sìzhī zhènliàng* 四肢振焮), **stiffness throughout the spine and joints** (*yāobèi bǎijié jiē qiáng* 腰背百节皆强), and **pain in the knees**; or they may **perspire and feel hot** (*hūhū ér rè* 翕翕而热), but **only desire to sleep** (*dàn yù shuì* 但欲睡), waking in the morning but worsening in the evening, with **coldness in the hands and feet extending to the elbows and knees** (*shǒuzú nìlěng zhì zhǒushāi qūxī* 手足逆冷至肘膝). Within **two or three days**, **parasites will form in the abdomen** (*fúzhōng shēngchóng* 腹中生虫), consuming the patient’s **lower body** (*xiàbù* 下部), causing **sores in the anus** (*gāngzhōng yǒuchuāng* 肛中有疮) that are **neither painful nor itchy** (*bù tòng bù yǎng* 不痛不痒), making the patient unaware. If not treated urgently, after **six or seven days**, **pus will discharge from the lower body** (*xiàbù chūnóng xuàn* 下部出脓溃). The parasites will then **ascend and consume the five viscera** (*shàngshí wūzàng* 上食五脏), leading to **severe heat and toxic agitation** (*rèshèng dúfán* 热盛毒烦), **uncontrollable diarrhea** (*xiàlì bùjìn* 下利不禁). By the **eighth or ninth day**, even a **skilled physician** (*liángyī* 良医) cannot treat it.

If the patient is aware of the toxin, **immediate action is critical**. Examine the lower body early; if the sore is **bright red like a cross-section of meat** (*yángdú zhèngchì yú duànròu* 阳毒，最急；截肉者), it is **yang toxin** (*yángdú* 阳毒), the most urgent case. If the sore resembles **the scales of a carp** (*lǐyú chǐ* 鲤鱼齿), it is **yin toxin** (*yīndú* 阴毒), but still requires prompt attention. Regardless, these toxins **will kill the patient within twenty days**.

To determine whether the toxin is from water or another source, prepare **five or six *shāng* (升)** of hot water. Add **five *shāng* (升)** of **minced garlic** (*wǔsuàn* 小蒜, finely chopped), and simmer without letting it boil excessively. Strain and use the liquid for bathing. If the toxin is from water, **red patches will appear on the body** (*shēntǐ fāchì hóngbān* 身体当发赤斑). If there are no such signs, it is not water toxin, and should be treated as another ailment.

**For Treating Sudden Water Toxin Attacks:**
If a person is suddenly struck by water toxin, with **cold extremities** (*shǒuzú zhǐlěng* 手足指冷) or coldness extending to **elbows and knees** (*hòu zhì zhǒushāi qūxī* 或至肘膝), take **Brief Bristle Wormwood** (*wúzhūyú* 吴茱萸) one *shāng* (升), **fresh ginger** (*shēngjiāng* 生姜) chopped, one and a half *shāng* (升), **rhinoceros horn** (*xījiǎo* 犀角), **Cang Er Zi** (*shèngmá* 升麻), **tangerine peel** (*júpí* 橘皮) each two *liǎng* (两), and **black plum** (*wūméi* 乌梅) fourteen pieces. The six ingredients above, finely chopped, are boiled in **seven *shāng* (升)** of water, reducing to **two *shāng* (升)**. Divide into two doses and consume.

Another remedy: **Dried Floating Heart Grass** (*fúpíng cǎo* 浮萍草), exposed to the sun until dry, ground into powder, and taken with wine, **one *fāngcùn* (方寸) spoonful** at a time.

Another remedy: Take **plum or peach leaves** (*méi ruò táo yè* 梅若桃叶), pound and strain to extract the juice, approximately **three *shāng* (升)**. Alternatively, dry the leaves and strain them with a small amount of water to extract the juice for drinking. For children who cannot drink, apply the juice to their **nipples** (*rǔtóu* 乳头) for ingestion.

Another remedy: Pound **Xanthium fruit** (*cāng’ěr* 苍耳) to extract its juice, and drink **one *shāng* (升)**. Also, wrap a stick with cotton, dip it in the juice, and use it to **administer an enema** (*dǎoxiàbù* 导下部) three times daily until recovery.

Another remedy: Pound **one handful of Polygonum** (*liǎo* 蓼), mix with wine, strain to extract **one *shāng* (升)** of juice, and drink it. Recovery will occur within no more than three doses. *Wàitái* (外台) and *Zhǒuhòu* (肘后) use **pear leaves** (*líyè* 梨叶) instead.

Another remedy: Pound **one handful of Indigo Plant** (*lán* 蓝), dissolve in water, and apply it to **wash the face, eyes, and body** (*tú mùshēn shēntǐ* 浴面目身体) thoroughly.

Another remedy: Pound **snakeberry roots** (*shé méi gēn* 蛇莓根) into powder, and drink with water, while also using it to **administer an enema** (*dǎoxiàbù* 导下部). If using **fresh roots** (*shēng* 生), use the juice instead.

In general, during the **summer months** (*xiàyuè* 夏月), always carry **these medicinal powders** (*cǐ yào xiè* 此药屑) when traveling. Before entering the water, sprinkle **one *fāngcùn* (方寸) spoonful** of the powder onto the water’s surface, and there will be no fear of toxins. This also **repels *Shègōng* (射工) stings**. When washing or bathing, sprinkle a small amount into the water basin, and the water will be free of toxins.

**For Treating Cat Ghost (Māoguǐ, 猫鬼) and Wild Dao (Yědào, 野道) Toxic Illnesses, Where the Patient Cannot Sing or Cry Freely:**
Burn **a dead red snake** (*zìsǐ chìshé* 自死赤蛇) collected on **the fifth day of the fifth month** (*wǔyuè wǔrì* 五月五日) into ash. Take **one *fāngcùn* (方寸) spoonful** of the ash with **well water** (*jǐnghuā shuǐ* 井花水), and consume it daily, once.

Acupuncture and moxibustion methods are detailed in another volume.

Another prescription:
In the twelfth month (Làyuè, 腊月), burn the head of a dead kitten to ash, and take **one *qián* (钱) spoonful** with water, twice daily.
**For treating Cat Ghost (Māoguǐ, 猫鬼) afflictions where the patient sees cats or hears phantom sounds:**

- **Castor beans (Bìmázǐ, 蓖麻子)** – 1 piece
- **Croton seeds (Bādòu, 巴豆)** – 1 piece
- **Cinnabar powder (Zhūsā, 朱砂)** – 4 *zhǔ* (铢)
- **Wax (Là, 蜡)** – 4 *zhǔ* (铢)

Combine these five ingredients into a pill. First, place a castor bean-sized pill in the mouth. Then, surround the afflicted person with ash, lighting a *dǒu* (斗) of ash in front of them. When the person spits out the medicine into the burning ash, stir the flames into a cross shape—this will kill the Cat Ghosts.

**For treating spider bites and venomous stings:**
Apply **human urine**.
Or apply **oil residue**.
Or apply **dried ginger (pao jiang, 炮姜)** as a poultice.
Or apply **monkey feces (húsūn shǐ, 猢孙屎)**.

Another prescription:
Mix **black sesame oil (wūmá yóu, 乌麻油)** with **barite powder (húfěn, 胡粉)** into a paste, apply it, and replace when dry.

**For treating dog or horse bites, horse bone punctures, or horse blood entering old wounds:**
Apply **ash lye (huīzhī, 灰汁)**, soaking the wound while keeping the lye container heated. Change the lye frequently to prevent it from rotting the flesh; soak for three to five days. If swelling occurs, apply **hot stone compresses (zhìshí wèn, 炙石熨)** twice daily until the swelling subsides.

**For treating horse blood entering a wound:**
Consume **human feces the size of an egg**, then apply more feces to the wound. Another prescription: Apply **menstrual blood (nǚrén yuèshuǐ, 妇人月水)**—this is highly effective.

**For treating injuries from a dead horse, horse bone punctures, or severe toxic attacks nearing death:**
Immediately apply **feces from the horse’s intestines**—this is very effective.
*The *Wàitái Fāng* (《外台方》) states:* Burn the feces into ash and take **one *fāngcùn* (方寸) spoonful**.

On rabid dogs in late spring and early summer, it is said:

*"Discussion:*
When spring ends and summer begins, dogs often go mad. One must warn the weak and young to carry staves as a precaution. If prevention fails, **moxibustion** is the only remedy—without daily treatment for a hundred days, escape from danger is impossible. If the wound appears healed and the pain subsides, and one declares recovery, this is most perilous—great calamity is imminent, and death may come within days.

When a rabid dog bites, the victim inevitably becomes mad. How can one know this in advance? Observe during moxibustion: if even a single application of fire makes the patient suddenly lucid, fully aware, then one knows the bite has already induced madness. This must be deeply understood.

This illness is most grave, yet the world treats it lightly, taking no heed—many die from this neglect annually. In my early medical studies, I did not yet practice professionally, but when such cases were brought to me, I had no answer. Thus, many died under my care. Only then did I dedicate myself to its study. Since mastering this, all treated have recovered. I now realize half of those who die from rabid bites perish for want of true physicians—this is no exaggeration.

Future learners must not rely solely on this method. All prescriptions must be pondered deeply, studied with diligence, and learned earnestly to achieve true mastery. Do not presume knowledge after grasping just one or two remedies—this is self-deception.

I append these words at the end of the text, though my meaning remains incomplete.

It is further said:
When a rabid dog bites, symptoms typically appear every seventh day. If no outbreak occurs within three cycles (21 days), the danger recedes—but one must still endure a hundred days to be certain of survival. Every seventh day, one must drink **two to three *shāng* (升)** of **scallion juice (jiǔ zhī, 韭汁)**. For life, one must abstain from **dog meat and silkworm pupae (cán yǒng, 蚕蛹)**—consuming these will trigger the illness, rendering rescue impossible.

While the wound heals, avoid **raw fish and rich, cold, or greasy foods**. Even steamed fish or eating from fatty vessels may provoke an outbreak. Alcohol must be forbidden—abstinence for a year is ideal.

*The *Jíyàn Fāng* (《集验方》) states:*
For severe cases, consuming **raw toad (chánchú, 蟾蜍) slices** is most effective. Alternatively, roast and eat the toad, ensuring the patient is aware. If administered immediately after the bite, subsequent outbreaks are prevented.

**Prescriptions for rabid dog bites:**

1. **Prescription:**
   Equal parts **human hair (tóufà, 头发)** and **hedgehog skin (wèipí, 猬皮)**, burned to ash. Mix with water and drink one cup. For locked jaws, force the powder into the teeth.

2. **Prescription:**
   Crush **Chinese wolfberry (dìyòu, 地榆)**, strain the juice, and apply to the wound. If no fresh herb is available, use the dried form—boil into a decoction for drinking or powder for ingestion (one *fāngcùn* spoonful, three times daily), also applying it to the wound. Continue for over a hundred days before stopping.

3. **Prescription:**
   Crush **scallions (jiǔ, 韭)**, strain the juice, and drink one *shāng* (升), three times daily, until the wound heals. This also treats relapses after recovery.

4. **Prescription:**
   Scrape **tiger tooth or bone (hǔyá/hǔgǔ, 虎牙/虎骨)** into powder, take one *fāngcùn* spoonful. *The Xiǎopǐn Fāng (《小品方》) states:* Scrape **wolf or tiger bone** into powder for ingestion. If madness has already set in, this cures it.

5. **Prescription:**
   Burn **tiger bone (hǔgǔ, 虎骨)** and apply to the wound, or use it for **moxibustion**. Also, lightly roast **apricot kernels (xìngrén, 杏仁)**, crush into a paste, and drink the juice—this is effective. Alternatively, pour **residual lamp oil (dēngzhǎn cányóu, 灯盏残油)** into the wound. All these methods require abstaining from **alcohol, pork, fish, and raw vegetables**.

6. **Prescription:**
   Use **two old scallion combs (jiǔgǔn, 韭根故梳)**, boil in **two *shāng* (升) of water**, reduce to one *shāng*, and drink at once.

The text states: For treating **metal wounds** (jīn chuāng), whether large or small, in winter or summer, and even when blood first emerges upon injury, immediately apply thickly wrapped slaked lime to stop the bleeding and alleviate pain; it also promotes rapid healing. If slaked lime is unavailable, ash (huī) may be used instead. For wounds that are very deep and should not heal quickly, add a small amount of talc (huá shí) to prevent premature closure.

In cases of **metal wounds** with bleeding, the patient will inevitably feel thirsty; they must endure it and consume dry, fatty, and nourishing foods to quench their thirst, avoiding salty dishes. If they drink excessive amounts of porridge or gruel (jiāng), or consume warm, moist foods (rè gēng), the wound may rupture, causing blood to flow uncontrollably and risking death. Additionally, they must avoid anger, loud laughter, excessive mental exertion, sexual activity, strenuous movement, overconsumption of sour or salty foods, alcohol, and hot, greasy meals. Even after the wound has healed, these restrictions should be maintained for a hundred days or half a year before resuming normal activities.

**Prescription for a Universal Metal Wound Poultice (Dà Sàn Fāng):**
On the fifth day of the fifth month at dawn, instruct four individuals to collect plants, trees, and their stems, leaves, and branches from each of the four directions within five *lǐ* (approximately 1.6 miles). Take half a handful of each species, ensuring no omission. At noon, finely chop and pound the collected herbs together with slaked lime until thoroughly mixed and well-cooked. For every *dòu* (approximately 10 liters) of herbs, use one *dǒu* (approximately 10 liters) of slaked lime. First, hollow out a large, sturdy **mulberry tree** (sāng shù) to hold the medicine, then fill the cavity with the mixture and pack it firmly. Cover the opening with mulberry bark, and tightly seal it with hemp (má) to prevent the **qi** from escaping. Wrap the sealed tree securely with more mulberry bark and store it until the ninth day of the ninth month at noon, when it should be retrieved and dried in the shade for a hundred days. Once the medicine is fully prepared, pound it again, expose it to the sun daily to dry, and re-pound it. Store the final product through silk sieves. For all **metal wounds**—whether from cuts, fractures, or bleeding—apply this medicine immediately to seal and treat the wound firmly, preventing any movement. The wound will heal within ten days without swelling, pus, or fear of wind. If the injury is treated several days after occurrence, first warm-wash the area to induce bleeding before applying the medicine; its efficacy is remarkable. In times of peace, prepare this medicine in advance to be ready for emergencies. There is no more essential remedy for **metal wounds** than this; not even the *Cucujus* beetle’s powder (tūjué zhì hàn) can surpass it.

**On Dietary Therapy (Introduction to the First Chapter):**

Zhang Jing (仲景) said:
*"When the human body is in harmony, one need only cultivate good habits of nourishment and avoid reckless medication. Though medicines may offer some aid, they disrupt the balance of the organs’ **qi** (脏气), making one vulnerable to external afflictions. All beings that draw breath depend on food to sustain life, yet few understand how dietary choices determine success or failure. Common people consume it daily without discernment, while the vital principles of water and fire remain obscure. I lament this state and, in the leisure of my brush and ink, have composed this *Five Flavors: Dietary Harm and Benefit* (五味损益食治) chapter to enlighten the unlearned. If diligently followed, its wisdom will endure like an echo."*

The *River East* (Huang Dong) record of Wei Xuan (卫汛) notes:
*"Bi Que (扁鹊) taught that the foundation of human life is **form** (形); disruption of harmonious **qi** (和气) brings disease; regulation of toxins is the role of medicine; and saving lives and supporting the perilous is the physician’s duty. Food is essential for sustaining the body, while medicine is indispensable for swiftly curing illness. Without understanding proper foods, one cannot preserve life; without knowing medicinal taboos, one cannot eradicate disease. These two matters are vital to the living—if neglected without study, it is truly lamentable.

Thus, food can expel evil **qi** (邪) and stabilize the organs, delight the spirit, and invigorate the mind—thereby nourishing **blood** and **qi** (血气). If one can use diet to balance chronic ailments and release emotional distress, they may be called a master of their craft. The extraordinary methods of prolonging life and supporting old age are the pinnacle of **Dao** (道) of nurturing vitality.

The physician must first comprehend the origins of disease, identify its cause, and treat it with diet. Only when dietary therapy fails should they resort to medicine. Medicinal properties are fierce and potent, like wielding an army. Can one recklessly deploy soldiers without consequence? Improper use harms many; likewise, ill-advised medication spreads harm indiscriminately.

The High Prince of Gao Ping (高平王熙) remarked that food should not be mixed indiscriminately—for mixing may invite affliction. Where affliction arises, injury follows. Even if no immediate harm occurs, over time, such imbalances will plague the body. Moreover, one should avoid excessive consumption of fish and rich meats; instead, let food be simple and beneficial. In daily meals, moderation is key—greed for flavor and gluttonous feasts lead to distended stomachs, shortness of breath, and sudden violent illnesses, even cholera.

After the summer solstice, until the autumn equinox, one must be cautious with fatty, greasy, or overly sweet foods, as well as pastries and dairy products. These items clash with the **virtue/power** (德) of wine, grains, melons, and fruits. The body’s susceptibility to disease stems from overindulging in coldness during spring and summer, as well as irregular eating habits. Furthermore, fish and strong-smelling, cold foods often harm the body—abandoning them is beneficial.

Consuming dairy products like cheese and butter strengthens tendons and sinews, fortifies the gallbladder, and keeps the skin supple. If eaten excessively, they may cause diarrhea and gradual self-correction.

The Yellow Emperor (黄帝) said:
*'The five flavors enter the mouth, each with its own path and potential harm. Sour affects the sinews—excessive sourness causes urinary retention (癃). Why?*

*Min Yu (少俞) replied:*
*'Sour enters the stomach, where its **qi** (气) is astringent and contracting. It ascends to the two upper **jiao** (焦), but the **qi** of the upper **jiao** (焦), being astringent, cannot freely circulate. If it cannot ascend, it flows downward into the stomach, where warmth harmonizes it before it descends into the bladder. The bladder’s **qi** (气) is thin and soft—when exposed to sourness, it contracts and tightens, blocking the flow of water. Thus, urinary retention (癃) occurs. The sinews are where yin **qi** (阴者) accumulates—hence, sour enters the stomach and travels to the sinews.*

*‘Salty affects the blood—excessive saltiness causes thirst. Why?’*

*‘Because salty **qi** (气) enters the stomach and descends into the middle **jiao** (焦), where it permeates the vessels. The vessels are the pathways of blood, and when salty **qi** (气) interacts with them, the blood congeals. Congealed blood drains the stomach’s fluids, leaving it parched and thirsty. The *Jia Yi* (甲乙) text states: *‘Congealed blood causes the stomach’s fluids to drain, and drained fluids lead to extreme thirst.’* Thirst dries the throat, making the tongue rough and craving more drink. The vessels are the **Dao** (道) of the middle **jiao** (焦)—thus, salty **qi** (气) enters the stomach and travels to the blood. Huangfu Shian (皇甫士安) notes that the kidneys regulate the three **jiao**’s vessels, though they belong to the liver and heart, they are still the **Dao** (道) of the middle **jiao**—hence, salt enters and affects the blood.’*

*‘Pungent affects the **qi** (气)—excessive pungent flavors cause irritability and heartache (愠心). Why?’*

*‘Because pungent **qi** (气) enters the stomach and ascends to the upper **jiao** (焦), where it governs and harmonizes all **qi** (气) and nourishes the yang pathways. The **qi** of ginger and scallions permeates the **honor** (荣) and **defense** (卫) systems—if they do not receive pungent **qi** (气) in due measure, it lingers beneath the heart, causing #1 irritability (愠). Irritability is akin to pain. Pungent flavors move alongside **qi** (气), thus when they enter the stomach, they follow the **qi** (气) and exit with it, leading to excess **qi** (气).’*

*‘Bitter affects the bones—excessive bitter flavors cause nausea and vomiting (变呕). Why?’*

*‘Because bitter **qi** (气) enters the stomach and, being dry and dispersive, overwhelms the **virtue/power** (德) of the five grains. It descends into the lower **jiao** (管), where the three **jiao**’s pathways converge—if they close, **qi** (气) cannot flow, and stagnation leads to vomiting. The teeth are where yin **qi** (气) terminates—thus, bitter **qi** (气) enters the stomach, travels downward, and exits again, causing the teeth to darken and weaken. Huangfu Shian (皇甫士安) notes that water and fire support each other, so the bones’ **qi** (气) connects to the heart.’*

*‘Sweet affects the flesh—excessive sweetness causes nausea. Why?’*

*‘Because sweet **qi** (气) enters the stomach but, being weak and deficient, cannot ascend to the upper **jiao** (焦), instead lingering with the grains in the stomach. Sweetness softens and relaxes—when the stomach is relaxed, the roundworms (蛔) stir, leading to nausea. Sweet **qi** (气) externally permeates the flesh, thus when sweet enters the stomach and travels to the flesh, it causes the flesh to become coarse and develop goosebumps (粟起而胝). Huangfu Shian (皇甫士安) notes that its **qi** (气) externally permeates the skin...’*

Thus it is said: when sweet **qi** (气) enters, it travels to the skin. The skin is the covering of the flesh, though it belongs to the lungs, yet it is connected to the flesh as one entity, so sweet **qi** (气) moistens both the flesh and the skin.

The Yellow Emperor asked: *"Can I hear the principles of the five flavors of grains?"*
Bo Gao replied: *"To eat wind is to gain agility and lightness of movement; to eat **qi** (气) is to achieve harmony and longevity; to eat grains is to gain wisdom but exhaust the mind; to eat grass is to become foolish yet strong; to eat meat is to become courageous yet prone to anger."*

Therefore:
- The liver (肝), of wood (木) and green (青), suits sour (酸);
- The heart (心), of fire (火) and red (赤), suits bitter (苦);
- The spleen (脾), of earth (土) and yellow (黄), suits sweet (甘);
- The lungs (肺), of metal (金) and white (白), suit spicy (辛);
- The kidneys (肾), of water (水) and black (黑), suit salty (咸).

Internally, they govern the five **zàng** organs (脏); externally, they correspond to the five phases (行); and their colors align with the five directions (方).

The five **zàng** organs’ harmonizing principles:
- The liver (肝) harmonizes with sinews (筋), its **róng** (荣) being the nails (爪);
- The heart (心) harmonizes with vessels (脉), its **róng** (荣) being complexion (色);
- The spleen (脾) harmonizes with flesh (肉), its **róng** (荣) being the lips (唇);
- The lungs (肺) harmonize with skin (皮), its **róng** (荣) being hair (毛);
- The kidneys (肾) harmonize with bones (骨), its **róng** (荣) being the hair (发).

The five **zàng** organs’ dietary prohibitions:
- Excessive sour (酸) causes the skin to dry and hair to wither;
- Excessive bitter (苦) causes the sinews to contract and nails to brittle;
- Excessive sweet (甘) causes the bones to ache and hair to fall;
- Excessive spicy (辛) causes the flesh to become coarse and lips to crack;
- Excessive salty (咸) causes the vessels to congeal, tears to flow, and complexion to alter.

The five **zàng** organs’ suitable foods:
- For liver (肝) ailments: hemp (麻), dog meat (犬肉), plums (李), garlic chives (韭);
- For heart (心) ailments: wheat (麦), mutton (羊肉), apricots (杏), lovage (薤);
- For spleen (脾) ailments: glutinous rice (脾米), beef (牛肉), dates (枣), castor bean (葵);
- For lung (肺) ailments: yellow millet (黄黍), pigeon meat (鹦肉), peaches (桃), scallions (葱);
- For kidney (肾) ailments: soybeans and yellow rolls (大豆黄卷), pork (豕肉), chestnuts (栗), dodder (藿).

*The *Suwen* (《素问》) states:
- The liver (肝) is green (青), favoring sweet (甘): glutinous rice (秔米), beef (牛肉), dates (枣), and castor bean (葵) are all sweet;
- The heart (心) is red (赤), favoring sour (酸): small beans (小豆), dog meat (犬肉), plums (李), and garlic chives (韭) are all sour;
- The lungs (肺) are white (白), favoring bitter (苦): wheat (麦), mutton (羊肉), apricots (杏), and lovage (薤) are all bitter;
- The spleen (脾) is yellow (黄), favoring salty (咸): soybeans (大豆), pork (豕肉), chestnuts (栗), and dodder (藿) are all salty;
- The kidneys (肾) are black (黑), favoring spicy (辛): yellow millet (黄黍), chicken meat (鸡肉), peaches (桃), and scallions (葱) are all spicy.

The five flavors’ influence on disease:
- Sour affects the sinews (筋): when sinews are diseased, avoid sour;
- Bitter affects the bones (骨): when bones are diseased, avoid bitter;
- Sweet affects the flesh (肉): when flesh is diseased, avoid sweet;
- Spicy affects the **qi** (气): when **qi** is diseased, avoid spicy;
- Salty affects the blood (血): when blood is diseased, avoid salty.

The five flavors’ correspondences:
- Rice (米) and congee (饭) are sweet;
- Hemp (麻) is sour;
- Soybeans (大豆) are salty;
- Wheat (麦) is bitter;
- Dates (枣) are sweet;
- Plums (李) are sour;
- Chestnuts (栗) are salty;
- Apricots (杏) are bitter;
- Peaches (桃) are spicy;
- Yellow millet (黄黍) is spicy;
- Castor bean (葵) is sweet;
- Garlic chives (韭) are sour;
- Dodder (藿) is salty;
- Lovage (薤) is bitter;
- Scallions (葱) are spicy;
- Beef (牛) is sweet;
- Dog meat (犬) is sour;
- Pork (豕) is salty;
- Mutton (羊) is bitter;
- Chicken meat (鸡) is spicy.

The five **zàng** organs’ therapeutic dietary principles:
- If the liver (肝) is bitter and tense, eat sweet to relax it;
- If the liver (肝) seeks to disperse, eat spicy to disperse it;
- Use sour to purge it, but avoid exposure to wind.

- If the heart (心) is bitter and slack, eat sour to constrict it;
- If the heart (心) seeks softness, eat salty to soften it;
- Use sweet to purge it, but avoid warm food and thick clothing.

- If the spleen (脾) is bitter and damp, eat bitter to dry it;
- If the spleen (脾) seeks relaxation, eat sweet to relax it;
- Use bitter to purge it, but avoid warm food, overeating, dampness, or damp clothing.

- If the lungs (肺) are bitter and **qi** rises in reverse, causing breathlessness, eat bitter to vent it;
- If the lungs (肺) seek constriction, eat sour to constrict it;
- Use spicy to purge it, but avoid cold drinks or cold clothing.

- If the kidneys (肾) are bitter and dry, eat spicy to moisten them, opening the **tánglǐ** (腠理) and ensuring **qi** and fluids circulate;
- If the kidneys (肾) seek firmness, eat bitter to bind them;
- Use salty to purge them, but avoid scorching dust or heat—avoid warm food and hot clothing.

Thus, poisonous medicines attack evil, the five grains nourish, the five meats benefit, the five fruits assist, and the five vegetables fill. **Jīng** (精) is nourished by **qi** (气), and **qi** nourishes **jīng** to manifest complexion (色); the body is sustained by flavors, and flavors sustain the body to generate strength (力). This is the principle.

The **shén** (神) is stored in five ways, with five times five making twenty-five varieties; the body is stored in four directions, four seasons, four times, and four limbs—altogether, five nines, forty-five in total. By this means, one may assist the **shén** (神) to achieve longevity and enduring vision.

**Jīng** (精) follows the five **qì** (气) to become agile; if one’s **qì** (气) and food are incompatible, it harms **jīng**.
The body depends on flavors to form; if flavors are not balanced, it injures the body. Therefore, the sage first employs dietary regulation to preserve life essence (性), then uses medicine to safeguard vitality (命). Thus, when the body is deficient, warm it with **qì** (气); when **jīng** (精) is deficient, supplement it with flavors; and warm and supplement **qì** (气) and flavors to preserve **jīng** (精) and body.

Bo Gao said:
- **Yáng** (阳) is **qì** (气), **yīn** (阴) is flavor;
- Flavor nourishes the body, and the body nourishes **qì** (气);
- **Qì** (气) nourishes **jīn** (精), and **jīng** (精) refines into transformation (化);
- **Jīng** (精) consumes **qì** (气), the body consumes flavor;
- Transformation (化) generates **jīng** (精), and **qì** (气) generates the body;
- Rich flavors injure the body, and **qì** (气) deficiency harms **jīng** (精);
- **Jīng** (精) transforms into **qì** (气), and **qì** (气) is harmed by flavors;
- **Yīn** (阴) flavors exit through the lower orifices, while **yáng** (阳) **qì** (气) exits through the upper orifices.

- Rich flavors are **yīn** (阴), light flavors are **yīn**’s **yáng** (阴之阳);
- Rich **qì** (气) is **yáng** (阳), light **qì** (气) is **yáng**’s **yīn** (阳之阴).
- Rich flavors cause depletion, light flavors cause circulation;
- Light **qì** (气) causes emission, rich **qì** (气) causes stagnation.

- The **zhuànghuǒ** (壮火) **qì** (气) is weak, while the **shàohuǒ** (少火) **qì** (气) is strong;
- **Zhuànghuǒ** (壮火) consumes **qì** (气), and **qì** (气) nourishes **shàohuǒ** (少火);
- **Zhuànghuǒ** (壮火) disperses **qì** (气), while **shàohuǒ** (少火) generates **qì** (气).

- Spicy and sweet flavors disperse and emit as **yáng** (阳), while sour and bitter flavors surge and drain as **yīn** (阴);
- When **yīn** prevails, **yáng** becomes diseased; when **yáng** prevails, **yīn** becomes diseased;
- When **yīn** and **yáng** are balanced, one remains at peace.

Those taking medicinal concoctions must avoid deer meat—it weakens the efficacy of drugs. The reason is that deer habitually consume detoxifying grasses, thus able to neutralize poisons and disperse medicinal properties. The nine grasses are:

**Chapter on *Yǎng Xìng* (Nurturing the Nature/Qi)**

**Preface to *Nurturing the Nature/Qi***

**Biān Qiāo** [98] said: The **Yellow Emperor** taught that the **water clock** [99] drips water day and night, marking one hundred *kè* [100]. For every *kè*, a person breathes one hundred thirty-five times; ten *kè* make thirteen hundred fifty breaths; one hundred *kè* make thirteen thousand five hundred breaths.

The **breaths of humanity** [101] are but a fleeting measure in this world.
Truly profound! Ah!»

*(Annotations for reference only, not included in the translation.)*

In days of old, men lamented the passage of time—how could one not cultivate virtue to compensate for its fleeting nature? I often reflect that in one day and night, there are twelve *shí* [102], ten days and nights make one hundred twenty *shí*, a hundred days and nights make one thousand two hundred *shí*, a thousand days and nights make twelve thousand *shí*, and ten thousand days and nights make one hundred twenty thousand *shí*—this spans thirty years. If one lives to ninety years, they attain but three hundred sixty thousand *shí*. Within a hundred years, these moments pass like the blink of an eye, fleeting as the *cháo-jūn* and *máo-gǔ* [103]. How could one not cultivate oneself, yet indulge the Six Emotions, striving ceaselessly for fame and gain, resorting to deceit and cunning to seek hollow praise, never sated until death?

Thus, those who nurture their nature understand this: toward fame and gain, they regard them as transient; toward what is neither fame nor gain, they also regard it as transient—so they may pass through life unharmed. I lament the many perverse ways of the age, where men abandon themselves to ruin. On idle days, I roughly compose this *Yǎng Xìng* [Nurturing the Nature/Qi] essay, to encourage the Way of humanity, for those virtuous gentlemen who share my aspirations.

To nurture one’s nature is to habituate the self until virtue becomes innate—nature itself becomes good, and without cultivation, nothing is unbeneficial. Once nature is inherently good, all internal and external ailments naturally do not arise, and calamities and misfortunes find no cause to manifest. This is the great principle of nurturing the nature.

Those who excel in nurturing their nature treat diseases before they manifest—this is its essence. Thus, nurturing the nature is not merely about ingesting elixirs or feasting on the *xiá* [104], but lies in encompassing all virtues. When all virtues are complete, even without elixirs, one may attain longevity. If virtue is lacking, though one consumes *yù-yè jīn-dān* [105], it cannot extend life.

Hence, *Lǎozǐ* [106] said: *"The adept at preserving life walks on land without encountering tigers or wild oxen"*—this is the teaching of Dao and virtue. How could one rely on elixirs to pray for longevity?

The sages formulated elixirs to rescue those whose conduct was already flawed. Thus, the foolish cling to illness for years without amending a single deed, dying in suffering without remorse—this is why *Qí Hé* [107] and *Péng Zhú* [108] departed too soon. *Jī Kāng* [109] said: There are five difficulties in nurturing life: not relinquishing fame and gain is the first; not mastering joy and anger is the second; not abstaining from sound and color is the third; not ceasing from indulging flavors is the fourth; and not preserving the spirit and essence is the fifth. If these five persist, though one aspires to longevity with the heart and recites profound teachings, chewing on their essence and breathing in the *Tàiyáng* [110], one cannot avoid misconduct or shorten their years. If these five are absent from the mind, then sincerity and harmony ascend daily, and Dao and virtue are perfected—blessings come without seeking, and longevity follows naturally. This is the fundamental principle of nurturing life.

Yet some may embrace benevolence and righteousness without the burden of excessive indulgence—perhaps they are but a step below!

The Yellow Emperor asked *Qíbó* [111]: *"I have heard that in the ancient times, men lived to a hundred years without their vitality declining. Now, men reach fifty and already decline—is this due to the changing times, or is it because humanity has lost the Way?"*

*Qíbó* replied: *"In the ancient times, those who understood the Dao regulated themselves according to yin and yang, harmonized with techniques and calculations, ate with moderation, and maintained regularity in their rising and resting. They did not indulge in reckless labor, and their form and spirit were in harmony, thus fulfilling their natural lifespan of a hundred years before departing. But today’s men are not so. They drink wine as their daily staple, indulge in licentiousness as their norm, enter chambers inebriated, exhaust their essence through desire, dissipate their true *qi*, and do not know how to preserve fullness. They do not govern their spirit in season, seeking only to gratify their hearts, indulging in pleasures contrary to life’s harmony, and lacking regularity in their conduct—thus they decline by fifty. The teachings of the ancient sages were universally followed. Even malevolent winds and evil influences were avoided in their proper seasons."*

「The Master Qi Bó said: In the age of antiquity, those who understood the *Dao*, aligned with the principles of yin and yang, harmonized with the arts of *shù*—the methods of nurturing life—maintained regularity in their meals, and disciplined their daily rising and resting. They did not exhaust themselves with reckless labor, and their physical form and vital *qi* remained in balance, allowing them to fulfill their natural lifespan of a hundred years before departing. But today’s men are not so. They drink wine as their daily nourishment, indulge in licentiousness as their norm, enter chambers inebriated, drain their essence through desire, dissipate their true *qi* without restraint, and do not know how to preserve fullness. They do not govern their spirit in accordance with the seasons, seeking only to gratify their hearts, indulging in pleasures contrary to life’s harmony, and lacking regularity in their conduct—thus they decline by fifty. The teachings of the ancient sages were universally followed. Even malevolent winds and evil influences were avoided in their proper seasons.

Those who cultivate stillness and embrace emptiness allow their true *qi* to flow naturally. Their spirit remains steadfast within, so how could illness find them? Thus, their will is serene and their desires few, their mind at peace and without fear, their body labored yet not weary, their *qi* following its natural course, and their pursuits aligned with their inclinations—all finding fulfillment. Therefore, they savor their food and adorn their attire—*Suǒwèn* states: *savor their food, adorn their attire*—and take joy in their customs, neither aspiring to what is above nor envying what is below, so their people remain simple and unadorned throughout their days. Hence, their senses are not strained by excessive cravings, their hearts not bewildered by licentiousness, and neither the foolish nor the wise, the virtuous nor the depraved, fear the world. They harmonize with the *Dao* and its methods, and thus all may attain a hundred years while their vitality remains unwaning—such is the completeness of their *virtue/power* and its safety.

Therefore, a man’s longevity or early demise depends on moderation. If he attunes to the ebb and flow of nature, he may achieve long life and immortality; if he indulges his emotions and desires, his fate shall be like morning dew. The Master Qi Bó said: At forty, yin *qi* begins to wane, and one’s vitality declines with rising and resting. At fifty, the body grows heavy, and the senses of hearing and sight grow dull. At sixty, yin *qi* weakens, strength and vigor greatly decline, and the nine orifices fail—with the upper body filled and the lower empty, tears and mucus flowing together. Hence, it is said: "Know it, and you shall not age; ignore it, and you shall grow old."

Though their names differ, all things arise from the same source. The wise discern the unity, the foolish see only the distinctions. The foolish lack what is essential, while the wise possess what is abundant. Abundance brings clarity to the ears and eyes, lightness to the body and strength to its frame—so that even in old age, one may regain vigor, and the strong may refine their essence further. Thus, the sage practices the art of *wu wéi*—non-action—takes delight in the flavors of simplicity and stillness, and though he indulges his desires and gratifies his will, he attains the preservation of emptiness. Therefore, his lifespan is boundless, enduring alongside heaven and earth. This is how the sage nurtures his body.

The first three months of spring—this is called *fā chén* (unfolding and renewing). Heaven and earth both give birth, and all things flourish. Sleep early and rise with the dawn, stroll widely in the courtyard, let your hair hang loose, and relax your form—thus invigorating your will. Let life unfold without suppression, give without taking, reward without punishment. This is the response to spring *qi*, the path of nurturing life. To act against it brings harm to the liver; in summer, it manifests as cold and disorder, so that those who honor the growth of spring shall live fewer years. The next three months of summer—this is called *fán xiù* (abundance and fruition). Heaven and earth exchange their *qi*, and all things bear fruit. Sleep early and rise with the dawn, never weary of the sun. Let your will remain without anger, let the blossoms and fruits reach maturity, and let your *qi* find release—if your affections lie outward, this is the response to summer *qi*, the path of fostering growth. To act against it brings harm to the heart; in autumn, it manifests as *chì yù* (chronic ailments and shivering), so that those who honor the harvest of summer shall live fewer years, and by winter, they shall suffer grave illness.

The next three months of autumn—this is called *róng píng* (containing and balancing). The *qi* of heaven grows urgent, while the *qi* of earth grows clear. Sleep early and rise with the dawn, awaken alongside the rooster. Let your will remain tranquil, and temper the severity of autumn’s *qi*. Gather and preserve your spirit and *qi*, so that autumn’s *qi* may be balanced. Do not let your will stray outward, and let the *qi* of the lungs remain pure—this is the response to autumn *qi*, the path of fostering containment. To act against it brings harm to the lungs; in winter, it manifests as *cān xiè* (excessive sweating and leakage), so that those who honor the storage of autumn shall live fewer years.

The next three months of winter—this is called *bì cáng* (sealing and storing). Water freezes and the earth cracks; do not disturb the yang. Sleep early and rise late, waiting for the sunlight. Let your will be as if hidden or concealed, as if you had private intentions or already attained fulfillment. Seek warmth and avoid cold, do not expose your skin, and do not let your *qi* be violently drained—this is the response to winter *qi*, the path of fostering storage. To act against it brings harm to the kidneys; in spring, it manifests as *wěi jué* (withering and fainting), so that those who honor the birth of winter shall live fewer years.

Heaven has four seasons and five elements, giving birth, growth, containment, and storage, and manifesting as cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind. Man has five *zàng* (viscera), transforming into five *qi* (vital energies), which give rise to joy, anger, sorrow, worry, and fear. Therefore, joy and anger harm the *qi*, while cold and heat harm the form; violent anger depletes yin, and excessive joy depletes yang. Hence, if joy and anger are not moderated, and cold and heat are not attuned to, life’s foundation shall not be secure. If a man can align himself with the seasons and adjust accordingly, he may avoid early decline and untimely death.

Zhòng Cháng Tǒng said: In the palaces of kings and nobles, there are a thousand beautiful women; in the homes of officials and warriors, there are hundreds of attendants. By day, they steep their bones and marrow in pure wine; by night, they drain their blood and *qi* through the chambers. Their ears listen to lewd sounds, their eyes delight in forbidden colors, and they neither emerge from feasting within nor return from their revels without. "The king and nobles receive this from above, while the warriors and the bold indulge in it below. When childbirth is untimely, when weaning comes too soon, when children are prematurely exposed to the *qi* of adults, or when illness drains their essence and desire, their *qi* grows weak and their blood insufficient. Even before they leave the womb, their nurturing is without method, and then they are further enfeebled by the steaming of silk and the overindulgence in the five flavors. Injured in the womb, sickly as infants, they remain frail and never attain true strength. If they then indulge their emotions and desires, these weaknesses multiply and diseases breed from diseases. The realm lacks skilled physicians, and those who practice medicine do not discern its true arts—fraudulent assistants abound, and errors are common. When a sickness strikes, none can escape it. Today, few live to a hundred years, is it not because their habits are not pure and correct?

Bào Pǔ Zǐ said: Someone asked, "What you call *injury* refers only to licentious desires?" I replied: Why limit it to that alone? Indeed, the key to long life lies in the practice within the chambers. The superior man understands this, and may thereby extend his years and ward off illness; the lesser does not harm himself through it. If one is in the prime of youth and knows how to employ the *Huán yīn Dān* (method of returning yin) to nourish the kidneys, and to take the seven *bǎi* (herbs) for longevity—though some texts say "seven *gǔ* (grains),"—without resorting to medicines, he shall not fall short of a hundred or two hundred years, though he may not attain immortality. Those who fail to grasp the art shall be compared to using a metal cup to hold soup or a feathered pouch to store fire—both futile and harmful. Furthermore, straining the mind beyond one’s capacity causes injury, exerting the body beyond its strength causes injury, deep sorrow and heavy resentment cause injury, grief and melancholy cause injury, excessive joy and mirth cause injury, obsessive pursuit of desires causes injury, constant dread of misfortune causes injury, prolonged talking and laughter cause injury, irregular sleep and rest cause injury, drawing the bow or tauting the crossbow causes injury, deep intoxication and vomiting cause injury, lying down immediately after a heavy meal causes injury, leaping about and panting for breath causes injury, loud shouting and weeping causes injury, and the failure to unite yin and yang causes injury.»

The accumulation of injuries to their utmost, when exhausted, leads to early death—this is not the Dao. Therefore, those who cultivate their nature do not spit too far, walk too swiftly, listen too intently, gaze too keenly, sit for too long, stand to the point of exhaustion, or lie down until drowsiness sets in.

They clothe themselves before feeling cold and remove their garments before feeling hot; they do not eat when excessively hungry, nor eat to the point of overfullness; they do not drink when excessively thirsty, nor drink to excess. Overindulgence in food leads to stagnation and accumulation, while excessive drinking produces phlegm and dampness.

They avoid excessive labor, excessive idleness, excessive sweating, excessive spitting, reckless running or riding, straining the eyes with distant gazes, consuming too many raw or cold foods, drinking wine in the wind, frequent bathing, harboring grand ambitions or distant aspirations, or contriving artificial marvels.

In winter, they do not seek extreme warmth; in summer, they do not pursue extreme coolness. They avoid sleeping exposed to the stars and moon, nor do they use fans while sleeping. They do not expose themselves to great cold, great heat, great winds, or thick fogs.

The five flavors should not be consumed in excess: too much sour harms the spleen, too much bitter harms the lungs, too much pungent harms the liver, too much salty harms the heart, and too much sweet harms the kidneys. These are the five flavors counteracting the five viscera, the natural principles of the Five Phases.

As for what is said to cause injury, its harm is not immediately apparent—only prolonged exposure diminishes one’s lifespan. Thus, those skilled in preserving life regulate their rising and resting according to the seasons’ early and late hours, maintain harmonious routines in their daily activities; they adjust and nourish their sinews and bones through reclining and stretching; they dispel ailments and manage duties through breathwork techniques; they apply harmonizing methods of supplementation and reduction; they balance labor and rest through principles of moderation.

They suppress anger to preserve yin, restrain excessive joy to nourish yang, and first take herbal remedies to rectify deficiencies before resorting to elixirs to achieve immortality. The principles of cultivating one’s nature are exhausted here.

As for those who seek to indulge their desires, act on impulse, and claim to comprehend fate and destiny—unbound by heterodox teachings, indulging their nature and exerting themselves without restraint—when they hear these words, even if they pass like the wind or flash like lightning before their eyes, they cannot comprehend them. Though their bodies wither in their attachments and their *qi* fades in their luxuries, they delight in it. How could one then instruct them in the ways of nurturing life? Not only do they refuse to accept it, but they dismiss it as superstition.

To expect them to believe is like offering a mirror to the blind or playing music for the deaf. When Wei Wu [Cao Cao] commanded Royal Secretary Huangfu Long, saying, *“I hear you have surpassed a hundred years, yet your vitality remains unwaning, your ears and eyes sharp, your complexion serene and joyful—this is a marvelous feat. May I inquire about your diet, practices, and guided movements? If there are teachings worth passing down, I would hope you might confide them in secrecy within the imperial precincts.”*

Huangfu Long replied in a memorial:

*"Your servant has heard that among the natures of Heaven and Earth, none is more noble than humanity; and among human concerns, none is more precious than life. The chaos of Tang [the ancient mythical age] had no beginning, and the cycles of the *eon* [劫, *kalpa*] are boundless. Human life unfolds within this expanse, fleeting as lightning’s flash. Each time I ponder this, my heart grows hot with urgency. Life comes but once and cannot be recalled—why not restrain one’s passions and nurture one’s nature to preserve oneself?

Now that the Four Seas are nearly pacified and the era is one of Great Peace, one must further unfold one’s talents and cultivate virtue to attain longevity—*a span of ten thousand years*. A span of ten thousand years is boundless, and this depends on cultivating the Dao. The Dao is easy to know, yet few can practice it.

Your servant has often heard of Daoists in Jing who have lived to 178 years yet remain vigorous. They say that if one daily consumes *yuquan* [玉泉, ‘jade spring’] and practices *zhuochi* [琢齿, ‘polishing the teeth’], one will remain youthful with a radiant complexion, expel the three worms [三虫, intestinal parasites], and strengthen one’s teeth. *Yuquan* refers to the saliva in one’s mouth. Before dawn, one should gargle with saliva until the mouth is full, then swallow it; *zhuochi* involves brushing the teeth seventy-two times. Only thus does one refine the essence.

Jie Kang said: ‘In years of abundance, there are many illnesses; in years of famine, there are few diseases.’ Truly, this is not empty!"*

「Thus, the people of the Central Plains are frugal by nature, their kitchens offering only pickled vegetables and fermented sauces. Their lives are marked by few illnesses and long years. In the southern regions beyond the Ling Mountains, however, there is abundance in all things—fish and meats from land and sea are plentiful—yet the people suffer many diseases and die young. The scholars of the northern lands, when they travel and reside there, encounter such opulence and believe it to be the blessing of fortune.

Therefore, regardless of status or age, they indulge their appetites without restraint. Long nights of drunkenness and gluttony leave their bodies hot and congested; they sleep naked and exposed, their undigested food festering within. Within less than a month, both young and old fall ill. Some suffer from cholera [霍乱], beriberi [脚气], or distension [胀满], others from alternating cold and heat, malaria, or dysentery [疟痢], foul growths and swellings [恶核丁肿], abscesses [痈疽], hemorrhoids [痔漏], or paralytic stroke [偏风猥退]. Unable to discern proper care, they perish. Such cases are endless; all they say is that they are unaccustomed to the local climate, yet none know the true source of their afflictions. Reflecting upon this, one cannot help but sigh deeply.

Students of the Dao must first recognize this truth and take it as a warning to be cautious. *Bao Pu Zi* [抱朴子, ‘Embracing Simplicity’] says: “The body of one person is a microcosm of a state. The chest and abdomen are like palaces and halls; the limbs are like the outlying districts; the bones and joints are like the officials. The spirit is like the ruler, blood like the ministers, and *qi* like the people. To govern one’s body is to govern a state.

He who loves his people ensures the stability of his state; he who cherishes his *qi* preserves his body. If the people scatter, the state falls; if the *qi* is exhausted, the body dies. The dead cannot be revived, nor can the fallen be restored. Therefore, the perfected ones [至人] prevent ailments before they arise and cure sicknesses before they take hold, treating them in the absence of symptoms rather than waiting until they have passed.

For man is hard to nourish and easily endangered; *qi* is hard to purify and easily turbid. Thus, one who understands how to safeguard the state with virtue and power [威德] and fortify the body by restraining desires can attain the *Zhen Yi* [真一, ‘True Unity’], preserve the *San Yi* [三一, ‘Three Unities’], repel all diseases, and extend his years.

**Chapter Two: Nurturing Nature by Dao Lin** [道林, ‘Daoist Forest’]
The perfected ones [真人] say: “Even if one constantly consumes elixirs [服饵] yet does not practice the cultivation of nature, it is still difficult to achieve longevity.

The Dao of nurturing nature is to always seek moderation, avoiding neither excessive fatigue nor straining beyond one’s limits. Moreover, stagnant water does not rot, and door hinges do not decay, for they are in constant motion. Thus, in nurturing nature, one must avoid prolonged standing, sitting, walking, or reclining, as well as excessive looking or listening. For prolonged looking harms the blood, prolonged reclining harms the *qi*, prolonged standing harms the bones, prolonged sitting harms the flesh, and prolonged walking harms the sinews.

One must also avoid overindulging in food, excessive drinking, heavy lifting, deep sorrow, violent anger, extreme grief, great fear, reckless leaping, excessive speech, or boisterous laughter. Do not be overly eager for what you desire, nor harbor grudges and resentment. All these excesses shorten life. If one can refrain from them, then longevity is attainable.

Therefore, those skilled in preserving life [摄生] always cultivate little thought, little contemplation, little desire, little busyness, little speech, little laughter, little sorrow, little joy, little pleasure, little anger, little fondness, and little aversion. Practicing these twelve moderations is the fundamental principle of nurturing nature. Excessive thought weakens the spirit, excessive contemplation scatters the will, excessive desire dulls the mind, excessive busyness strains the body, excessive speech depletes the *qi*, excessive laughter harms the organs, excessive sorrow paralyzes the heart, excessive joy exhausts the mind, excessive pleasure leads to forgetfulness and confusion, excessive anger disrupts the hundred vessels [百脉], excessive fondness causes obsession and distraction, and excessive aversion brings emaciation and despondency. If these twelve excesses are not eliminated, the *honorific* and *defensive* energies [荣卫] will lose their measure, blood and *qi* will act erratically, and the root of death will be sown. Only he who neither indulges in excess nor falls into deficiency approaches the Dao.

Thus, it is known that avoiding external influences [外缘] is the first method of the perfected ones in their Daoist practice. If one can do this, he may dwell even in pestilential regions without fear or doubt.

Having set aside external influences, one must then guard the Five Spirits [五神]—liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—and adhere to the Four Rectitudes [四正] in speech, conduct, sitting, and standing. Speech must never indulge in idle thoughts or false contemplations; if the mind is filled with desires or evil, great harm will arise. Hence, Confucius said: *“The mind must not be filled with wickedness”* [思无邪]. One should always practice the Yellow Emperor’s method of inward gazing [内视], storing and pondering thoughts, so that the Five Organs [五脏] appear like suspended bells, their colors distinct and clear. This practice must never cease.

Furthermore, each morning upon rising, one should face south, extend both hands upon the knees, and with the heart’s eye [心眼] observe the *qi*, letting it ascend to the crown [顶] and descend to the *Yongquan* [涌泉, ‘gushing spring’]. This daily practice is called *Yingqi* [迎气, ‘receiving *qi*’].

One should always inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, doing so gently without opening wide. The exhalation should be brief, while the inhalation should be deep. Each time one eats, one should direct the *qi* into the abdomen, letting the *qi* serve as the host. Whenever the mind has any fondness, one should not indulge it deeply; whenever it has any hatred, one should not indulge it deeply either. Both extremes harm nature and spirit.

One should also avoid excessive praise or excessive condemnation. The mind must always be balanced and equal toward all things; if one detects a tilt, one should immediately correct it. In poverty, do not believe it will always be so; in wealth, do not believe it will always endure. Dwelling in the midst of poverty and riches, one must always uphold the Dao, not letting wealth or poverty alter one’s resolve or nature. Understanding the principles of the Dao, one may seem unable to speak of them, yet this has great merit. Do not boast of fine medicine, nor of virtuous speech, nor let disordered thoughts enter the mind.

One must always use profound sincerity and reverence toward all things, being careful not to feign goodness to please others. Throughout one’s life, if one does good yet is despised, one must not harbor resentment. In serving one’s lord, if one is accused of flattery, one should balance the mind with the Dao. Where the Dao resides, its virtue will not be alone. Do not say that doing good brings no good fortune, and thus blame oneself.»

「One must dwell in contentment, ensuring the heart never feels deficient. If deficiency arises, one should restrain it within oneself, lest it grow. When a person knows to stop wanting, Heaven grants them their natural blessings.

In every place one goes, one must not seek excessively, for excessive seeking will weary the heart and burden the spirit. Indeed, the reason why people often fall ill is because they fail to nourish their true nature.

The days of peace and ease are said to be everlasting, yet if one indulges in unrestrained desires and seeks whatever the heart craves—without restraint, deceiving both the seen and unseen—one will do no wrong. Yet they claim to suit their nature, unaware that each indulgence is the root of future ailments.

When the hands find nothing to grasp and cold sweat flows, they invoke the *Huángtiān* (皇天) in vain, finding no relief. All such misfortunes stem from a lifetime of careless conduct, failing to self-examine. If one reflects inwardly during youth, they will realize that every action and thought fears the onset of disease, and that the four hundred and forty-four afflictions are self-made, not decreed by Heaven.

Once sickness strikes, gentle remedies will not suffice. Then they scorn medicine and *shénxiān* (神仙) as ineffective and powerless. Therefore, the wise who cherish life must ponder deeply, cultivate shame, and discipline themselves, always striving for goodness.

As for dwelling, one must avoid luxurious and ornate adornments that breed insatiable greed, for such excess is the source of harm. Instead, let the dwelling be simple and clean, free from wind, rain, heat, or dampness.

Utensils and garments should not be of precious jade, gold, or gems, lest they deepen the roots of affliction and stir the mind’s troubles. Meals should not overflow with salted or dried meats; frugality is best.

Then one should walk with the *éwángbù* (鹅王步) gait, speak in a *hánzhōngshēng* (含锺声) tone, and sleep as a lion reclining on its right flank, feet resting on the ground. Each day, one should recite:
*"Fine food must be chewed thoroughly,
Raw food should not be swallowed hastily.
Ask of my dwelling place,
It is the grand estate of the Forest Village.
Guard the prenatal breath within the five viscera,
Let the qi reach the bones to attain immortality.*
Another verse:
*"Three daily poisons must be consumed,
But chew them well lest they linger.
The five flavors are the five viscera’s bait,
Yet wear the coarse robes of the humble."*

Having steadied the mind, one must also be cautious with speech. When speaking or reciting, always imagine the voice resonating from the *qìhǎi* (气海) below the navel.

At the first hour after sunset, one should refrain from speaking or reciting; instead, wait until dawn. Upon rising, one should focus first on virtuous matters, not on calculating wealth.

While eating, one must not speak, for speaking while eating often causes chest and back pain.

Nor should one indulge in excessive talking or laughter in bed, for sleep should not be disturbed by speech. The five viscera are like bells and chimes; if they are not suspended, they cannot sound. Walking should not be accompanied by speech, for speaking while moving will cause one to lose their *qi*. On the winter solstice, one may speak but should not utter words recklessly.

When someone asks, one must not refuse to answer, but one should avoid speaking without necessity. It is best to avoid loud speech in cold air.

Having disciplined speech, one must also regulate eating and drinking. Thus, those who nourish their nature wisely eat only when hungry and drink only when thirsty; they prefer small, frequent meals over large, sudden ones, for the latter is hard to digest.

One should always maintain a balance between hunger and satiety—neither too full nor too empty. For overeating harms the lungs, hunger weakens the *qi*, excessive salt injures the sinews, and sourness damages the bones.

Therefore, one should practice eating bland foods, chewing thoroughly to ensure the essence of grains enters the stomach, not letting the grease of alcohol settle in the intestines. When eating, one must avoid sudden anger or excessive haste, for these stir the spirit and cause restless dreams and nighttime agitation.

Heavy meats should never be consumed, as they breed countless diseases. Instead, one should eat little meat, much rice, and a few pickled vegetables, while avoiding raw greens, raw rice, small beans, stale or foul-smelling foods. One must not drink turbid wine or eat coarse grains, lest they clog the *qi* pathways. Nor should one eat raw meat, which harms the stomach; all meats must be thoroughly cooked and eaten cold.

After eating, one should rinse the mouth several times to preserve strong teeth and fresh breath. If one rinses with cold, fermented water after hot meals or salty foods, their breath will always reek, and they risk *kuāngchǐbìng* (□齿病).

Moreover, after consuming hot foods or salty dishes, one must not drink cold vinegar or fermented water, for this often causes the voice to fail and the throat to seize as if dead.

When eating hot foods and sweating, one must not face the wind, lest it trigger *jìngtóu* (痉头) and headaches, making the eyes dull and inducing drowsiness.

After meals, one should massage the face and abdomen to encourage the free flow of *jīnyè* (津液). Upon finishing, one should walk slowly, covering several *lǐ* (里) in distance. Afterward, another should rub the abdomen with powder hundreds of times, aiding digestion and greatly benefiting the body. This practice ensures one can eat freely without a hundred diseases, and then true cultivation may begin.

Eating to fullness and then lying down breeds countless diseases, as the food does not digest and forms stagnation. Lying on one’s back after overeating leads to *qìbǐ* (气痞) and *tóufēng* (头风).

Those who eat hot foods while still feeling cold will suffer from *cìfēng* (刺风). One must not eat at night.

It is also said: Do not overindulge in drink or food at night, nor engage in intense mental labor, for such exertions harm the body.

*Yūxū* (虚损) weakens a person; one should finish eating by the *wèishí* (巳时) hour each day, then avoid alcohol entirely, and one will never suffer from dry heaves for life.

Do not eat meats belonging to one’s parents’ *běnmìng* (本命) element, for this shortens one’s lifespan. Nor should one eat meats belonging to their own *běnmìng* (本命) element, lest their *húnpò* (魂魄) scatter wildly.

One must avoid all brain meats, for they greatly harm the body.

If rainwater leaks into preserved meats stored in a thatched house, eating them causes *hùyuē* (瘕约). Meats preserved in brine that are not properly dried are also harmful to the body.

Meats that move on their own without cause, if eaten, will harm the body. If bees swarm over food, eating it will surely bring poison and harm.»

If one has lingering illnesses within the belly, one must not eat *lín* (鲮) or carp meat, for it harms the body.

Moist foods and alcoholic beverages should be inspected before consumption—if no human or animal shadows are seen upon them, do not eat, lest one suffer from *zúzhù* (卒注). If one has already eaten and their belly is distended, quickly administer medicine to purge it.

One should eat *kuí* (葵) once every ten days. *Kuí* is slippery, thus facilitating the circulation of *qi* through the five *zàng* (脏), and is the sovereign among vegetables—it should not be consumed with conflicting emotions.

Moreover, one should not drink alcohol excessively; if intoxication occurs, vomiting should be induced promptly to avoid drunkenness, for otherwise, one will never be free of a hundred ailments. Prolonged alcohol consumption rots the intestines and stomach, erodes the marrow, and steams the sinews, damaging the spirit and shortening life.

When drunk, one must not face the wind, nor bask in the sun, for this drives one mad. One must also avoid lying in the wind, nor should others fan them to cool them—both actions invite illness. When drunk, one must not sleep exposed or in piles of husked grain, for this causes *lài* (癞) sores. Drunkenness followed by forced eating may lead to *yōngjū* (痈疽), *yīn* (喑), or sores. When drunk and sated, one must not ride in carriages or leap about. Drunkenness followed by sexual intercourse—whether sober or not—may cause minor ailments like *miǎn* (面) or coughing, or severe damage to the *zàngmài* (脏脉), risking death.

When hungry, one should sit to urinate; when full, one should stand. Be cautious to avoid illness.

Retaining urine when inconvenient causes cold knees and *bì* (痹). Retaining feces when unable to expel them leads to *qìzhì* (气痔). Do not strain while urinating, lest the legs and knees grow cold. When defecating, avoid forcing with breath or straining, for this causes waist pain and blurred vision—it is best to relax naturally.

Wherever springs emerge in mountain valleys or basins, one must not dwell there long, as it invites *yǐng* (瘿) disease. Cold water from deep, shaded places must not be drunk, for it will surely cause *qí* (痎) or *nüè* (疟).

Diet should be regulated, and clothing adjusted according to the seasons. When dressing in the morning, reverse the garment before putting it on—this is auspicious. Clothing that has been exposed to light should be shaken three times before the door, saying, *"Disaster departs."* This is auspicious.

Damp or sweaty clothing must not be worn for long, for it causes sores and *fēngsào* (风瘙); frequent changing is ideal. If not changed, it must be washed immediately, otherwise, it will obstruct urination.

After sweating profusely, one must not speak while changing clothes, lest one invite *pòfēng* (偏风) and hemiplegia.

In spring, one must not wear thin clothing, for it invites *shānghán* (伤寒), *huòluàn* (霍乱), indigestion, and headaches.

After changing clothes, one must adjust their sleeping quarters. In spring and summer, one should sleep facing east; in autumn and winter, facing west. The head must not face north when sleeping, nor should the bed be placed against a north-facing wall.

Before sleeping, one must not sing or recite—this invites misfortune. When ascending the bed, one should remove the left foot first.

One must not sleep beneath the spine of the bed, nor leave lamps burning after retiring, lest the *húnpò* (魂魄) and the six *shén* (神) become restless, fostering endless grievances.

Fireplaces must not be placed near the head; prolonged exposure draws *huǒqì* (火气), causing heaviness in the head, reddened eyes, and dryness in the pupils and nose.

At night, one must ensure no openings exist near the ears where wind can blow, for this causes deafness.

In summer, one must not sleep with the face exposed, for this thickens the skin, invites *xiàn* (癣), or *miànfēng* (面风). In winter, one must not cover the head when sleeping, for this ensures longevity.

When sleeping, one must not dangle their feet from high places, for this damages the kidneys, weakens the *fáng* (房), and causes cold feet.

One must not lie directly beneath a straight wall within ten steps, for the *fēnglì* (风利) will blow and cause *diān* (癫) or heaviness in the body.

One must not sit with feet suspended while sweating, for this leads to *xuèbì* (血痹), heaviness in the legs, and waist pain.

Moreover, one must not nap during the day, for this causes *shīqì* (失气).

When sleeping, one must not speak loudly, for this depletes one’s *qìlì* (气力).

At dusk, one should habitually practice closing the mouth while sleeping; if the mouth is left open, one’s *qìlì* (气力) will be lost, and moreover, malevolent *qi* (邪恶) may enter through the mouth, leading over time to *xiāohè* (消渴) and pallor from blood depletion.

Bending the knees and sleeping on one’s side nourishes one’s *qìlì* (气力), surpassing the upright prone position. As Confucius did not sleep in a corpse-like posture, it is said: *"To sleep, one should not tire of bending the knees; to wake, one should not tire of stretching them."*

When one sleeps in a relaxed state, *guǐtòng* (鬼痛) and *móxié* (魔邪) may afflict them. Before sleeping, one must first settle the mind, then the eyes.

A single night’s sleep should be divided into five stages of rest, turning with each watch of the night.

If one is plagued by nightmares, do not light a lamp to awaken them; if you do, they will surely die. Call them softly in the dark instead.

If one has a night of evil dreams, do not speak of them upon waking; rather, wash the face with water and recite the following incantation: *"Evil dreams cling to grasses and trees; good dreams become precious jade."* Thus, no harm will come.

Moreover, whether dreams are good or evil, one should not speak of them as auspicious.

In all matters of clothing, food, and rest, one must align with the season’s *qì* (气). Only those who harmonize with the seasonal *qi* can fully embody the *Dao* (道) of nurturing life.

Thus, those skilled in preserving life avoid transgressing the taboos of the sun and moon, and do not disrupt the balance of the seasons. One must know:
- The daily taboo: do not eat to fullness at noon;
- The monthly taboo: do not drink heavily on the last day of the month;
- The yearly taboo: do not travel far at dusk;
- The lifelong taboo: do not walk about at dusk after lighting candles to engage in *fáng* (房).

This is how one should always guard their *qi* (气).

The *qi* of winter arises at *yǒngquán* (涌泉, the bubbling spring—soles of the feet) on the Winter Solstice, reaches the knees by the eleventh month, the thighs by the twelfth, the waist by the first month, and this is called *sāngchángchéng* (三肠成, the completion of the three intestines). By the second month, it reaches the arms, by the third the neck, and by the fourth the crown of the head. At this time, *chúnyáng* (纯阳, pure yang) prevails, and the yin follows suit accordingly.

Thus, during the fourth and tenth months, one must avoid *fáng* (房), lest they disrupt the months when yin and yang are in full harmony.

On the Winter Solstice, one should sleep with thick layers of grass spread beneath them on the northern wall, for this is said to receive the *yuángǔ* (元气, primordial *qi*).

From the first day of the eighth month onward, one should warm their feet with gentle fire, ensuring the lower body does not grow cold and lifeless. One must always strive to keep *qi* in the lower body, never allowing it to dissipate upward.

In spring, before the frost has fully melted, clothing should be thick at the bottom and thin at the top, to nourish the *cháng* (肠, intestines), preserve *yīn* (阴, yin), and extend one’s lifespan. To nourish yin and preserve it with a single misstep is to invite disaster that may annihilate one’s entire lineage.

Thus it is said: *"In winter, the *qi* of heaven and earth is closed, and blood and *qi* are stored away. One must not engage in labor that causes sweating, lest yang *qi* be released and harm the body."*

It is also said: *"In winter, the brain freezes; in spring and autumn, both the brain and feet freeze."* This is the constant method of the sages.

In spring, one should sleep late and rise early; in summer and autumn, one should sleep and rise just before midnight. In winter, one should rise early and sleep late. All these practices benefit the body.

Though it is said to rise early, do not do so before the rooster crows; though it is said to sleep late, do not delay until after sunrise.

If winter months suddenly grow hot or summer months suddenly grow cold, one must not expose themselves to such extremes.

Those who fall ill from the *qi* of the seasons are all due to violating these principles. One must regulate their breathing to balance cold and heat, and thus avoid illness.

On the *làrì* (腊日, the final day of the lunar year), one must not sing or dance; violators will surely meet misfortune.

It is beneficial to burn white hair on the *yínrì* (寅日, Tiger Day) of the first month. One should also trim fingernails on *yínrì* (寅日, Tiger Day) and toenails on *wǔrì* (午日, Horse Day), and burning white hair is auspicious.

**Section Three: Dwelling Practices**
When constructing or inhabiting a residence, the walls must be sealed tightly, with no gaps or cracks, lest *fēngqì* (风气, pathogenic wind-*qi*) enter.

When even a slight breeze arises, do not force yourself to endure prolonged sitting—you must quickly avoid it. Prolonged residence without awareness invites *zhòngfēng* (中风, windstroke). Throughout history, those who suddenly suffer from *piānfēng* (偏风, hemiplegia)—where limbs do not obey, or the body arches like a reversed bow, or speech is lost—all stem from neglecting this warning.

Once *zhòngfēng* (中风) takes hold, all maladies converge; pathogenic *xiéqì* (邪气) seizes the opportunity, and nine out of ten such cases meet a swift end. Thus, one must be utterly vigilant, never treating this lightly. **Caution! Caution!**

In one’s dwelling, do not seal up wells or water stains, lest they cause deafness and blindness.

When at home or traveling, if suddenly caught in violent winds, torrential rain, thunderstorms, darkness, or thick fog—all signs of *lóngguǐshén* (龙鬼神, dragons, spirits, and malevolent deities) in motion—one must retreat indoors, close the doors, burn incense, and sit in quiet meditation, directing the mind to evade them. Only after their passage should one emerge; otherwise, harm will follow. Even if no immediate suffering occurs, future misfortune is inevitable.

Similarly, avoid long journeys in misty conditions.

Within the home, if sacred scriptures or images are present, one must first bow before them upon entering, then bow to elders, and always sit upright upon arrival.

At home, frequent bathing is undesirable. If bathing is necessary, it must be done in a sealed chamber, avoiding extreme heat or cold—both generate myriad ailments.

In winter, bathing need not induce profuse sweating. After bathing, avoid exposure to wind or cold. Once hair is freshly washed, do not face the wind, let dampness cling to the hair bun, or sleep with a damp head—these practices invite *tóufēng* (头风, head wind), dizziness, hair loss, darkened complexion, toothache, deafness, and scaly scalp.

Bathing on an empty stomach is forbidden; bathing after a full meal is also prohibited. After bathing, consume a modest amount of food or drink before emerging.

Bathing hair at night, followed by sleep without eating, weakens the heart, induces excessive sweating, and provokes vivid dreams.

Moreover, spouses should never bathe on the same day. Bathing is auspicious only on *huìrì* (晦日, the final day of the lunar month) or *shuòrì* (朔日, the first day of the lunar month).

Using leftover broth to wash the body causes *xuǎn* (癣, tinea); washing the face dulls its luster; washing the feet induces pain and *zèngqí* (甑畦, a condition resembling blisters or ulcers). Washing hair with hot water followed by cold rinses provokes *tóufēng* (头风). Drinking water before bathing hair also triggers seasonal *tóufēng*.

After sweating from illness, avoid cold-water baths—this damages the *xīnbāo* (心包, Heart Envelope) and may prove fatal.

At home, always admonish and harmonize the conduct of elders and juniors. If any discomfort arises, it must be expressed promptly; suppression leads to prolonged suffering, which may escalate into incurable illness.

At the first sign of unease or *ānqì* (安气, stagnant *qi*), apply massage and kneading to restore mobility to all joints and disperse pathogenic influences.

Regardless of occupation, one must daily stretch the neck, back, and limbs, and vigorously massage the head and nape to fortify against seasonal *fēngqì* (风气). This is a paramount principle, too profound to exhaust here.

When at home or traveling, always carry with you one *shèng* (升) of dried *ài* (艾, mugwort), along with emergency pills (*bìguǐ* 避鬼丸, *shēngjī* 生肌药, *gānhuā* 甘湿药, *dīngzhǒng* 丁肿药), *shuǐyín* (水银, mercury), *dàyuán* (大黄, rhubarb), *mángxiāo* (芒硝, mirabilite), *gāncǎo* (甘草, licorice), *gānjiāng* (乾姜, dried ginger), *guìxīn* (桂心, cassia bark), and *shǔjiāo* (蜀椒, Sichuan pepper). No additional medicines need be stored—these essentials must never be lacking. Also carry a scroll of the *Bǎiyī Bèijí Yàofāng* (百一备急药方, *One Hundred and One Emergency Remedies*), including antidotes for venomous snakes, bees, and scorpions.

When one has recovered for ten days or more, apply *jiǔ* (灸, moxibustion) to several key acupoints to disperse *fēngqì* (风气). Daily, regulate *qi* through supplementation and drainage, and practice massage and *dǎoyǐn* (导引, guided movement). Do not assume health as permanent—always anticipate danger and preempt illness.

Moxibustion must be performed in seclusion, avoiding the presence of deities or spirits. The prohibitions regarding *rénshén* (人神, human-divine interactions) are detailed in Volume Twenty-Nine.

For those engaged in manual labor, administer *zhuǎnxiè* (转泻, purgative) remedies in spring and autumn to prevent *zhòng tiānxíng shíqì* (中天行时气, seasonal pathogenic influences).

**Harmonizing Qi Method (Fifth Section)**

**Pengzu said:**
*The Dao lies not in excess.* If one does not dwell on food and clothing, on sounds and colors, on victory or defeat, on right or wrong, on gain or loss, on honor or disgrace—
when the mind is unburdened and the body not overstrained, and this is combined with *dǎoyǐn* and unceasing *xíngqì* (行气, qi-circulation), then longevity may be attained, even immortality of a thousand years.
Though humans cannot be without thought, they must gradually dispel it.

**Pengzu said:**
To harmonize the spirit, guide the *qi*, and nurture the *Dao*, one must seek a secluded chamber, close the door, and rest on a warm bed with a pillow raised two and a half inches.
Lie straight, eyes closed, and retain the breath in the chest and diaphragm. Place a feather on the nose and keep it unmoved for three hundred breaths. Then, hear nothing, see nothing, think of nothing.
Thus, cold and heat cannot invade, wasps and scorpions cannot poison, and life may reach three hundred and sixty years—this is near the *Zhēnrén* (真人, True Person).

**Morning and Evening (旦夕)**
*Danxi* (旦夕) are the times of yin-yang transformation.
At dawn, the first watch, warm *qi* arrives—frequently close the eyes, for the *shàngshēngqì* (上生气, ascending life-qi) has come, called *yángxī* (阳息, yang’s pause) while *yīn* (阴) wanes.
At dusk, after the sun sets, cold *qi* arrives—chilly and sharp, the time to rise from bed and sit or lie down, for the *xiàshēngqì* (下生气, descending life-qi) has come, called *yángxiāo yīnxī* (阳消阴息, yang’s decline and yin’s pause).
The warm *qi* of dawn and the cold *qi* of dusk constantly circulate through heaven and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, seas and all things—human and beast, grass and wood—endlessly exchanging and transforming without rest.

「Advancing and retreating like the alternating succession of day and night, or the ebb and flow of the sea’s tides at dusk—this is the Dao/Way of heaven and earth’s *xiāoxì* (消息, ebb and flow of *qi*).

Facing south toward noon, extend both hands over the knees, gently pressing and releasing the limbs. Exhale foul *qi* through the mouth, inhale pure *qi* through the nose. For all exhalations, expel the old *qi*—also called *sǐqì* (死气, death-qi); for all inhalations, take in the fresh *qi*—also called *shēngqì* (生气, life-qi). Thus the *Lǎozǐ Jīng* (《老子经》) says: *"The gate of the mysterious female, the root of heaven and earth, soft and enduring as silk—it is the Dao/Way that never grows weary."* It speaks of how the mouth and nose, the gate of heaven and earth, can expel and receive the *qi* of yin-yang, death and life.

After some time, gradually use the hands in left-to-right, upper-to-lower, and front-to-back movements, glaring eyes and gaping mouth, striking teeth and rubbing eyes, pressing the head and tugging the ears, pulling the hair and loosening the waist—all to provoke coughing, exhaling, and vigorous shaking. Repeat each motion twice or once, reverse hands, then raise the legs and shake them upright, counting to eighty-nine or ninety before stopping.

Slowly settle the mind while lying down, practicing *chán guān* (禅观, meditative observation): close the eyes and focus the mind, envisioning the primordial *yuánqì* (元气) of *Tàihé* (太和, Supreme Harmony) in the void, like a canopy of purple clouds, five colors distinct, descending into the pores and gradually ascending to the crown, as if rain clears after a shower and clouds drift into the mountains. It penetrates skin into flesh, reaches bone and marrow, then descends into the abdomen. All four limbs and five viscera receive its nourishment, like water seeping into the earth—if it fully permeates, one hears a *mìmì* (汨汨) sound in the abdomen. With concentrated intent and steadfast thought, unperturbed by external distractions, soon one feels the *yuánqì* reach the *qìhǎi* (气海, Sea of *Qi*), then swiftly the *yǒngquán* (涌泉, Gushing Spring), causing the body to tremble, the feet to curl inward, and even the bed to creak with a *lālā* (拉拉) sound—this is called *yī tōng* (一通, one circulation).

With *yī tōng* (一通), *èr tōng* (二通), up to three or five circulations per day, the body grows joyful, the complexion radiant, the hair moistened, and the senses sharp. One’s appetite improves, *qi* and strength are robust, and all ailments vanish. For five years or a decade, one remains youthful and forgets aging. Achieving a thousand or ten thousand circulations, one is near to attaining immortality.

The human body is empty and void—only *yóuqì* (游气, wandering *qi*) exists within it. When the *qi* is harmonized, no disease arises. If its ebb and flow become disordered, then all illnesses surge forth. Those skilled in cultivation must know how to regulate *qi* first. Regulating *qi* cures all great afflictions—even growing new eyebrows and beard in a hundred days, let alone lesser ailments.

The method of regulating *qi*: between midnight and noon, when *qi* is ascending, one can harmonize it; between noon and midnight, when *qi* is descending, one cannot. When regulating *qi*, lie supine on the bed, with thick, soft bedding and a high pillow so the body is level. Stretch out the hands and feet, grasp the base of the thumbs with both hands, four to five inches from the body, and place the feet four to five inches apart. Repeatedly strike the teeth, drink *yùjīng* (玉浆, Jade Nectar), and draw *qi* from the nose into the abdomen—if it lingers, stop; if it has power, take more. If the *qi* stagnates in the abdomen, exhale it slowly through the mouth, then draw it in gently through the nose. Exhalation follows the earlier method.

Close the mouth and count internally, ensuring the ears hear nothing, lest there be error or confusion. Combine this with the downward pressing of the hands—if one can reach a thousand circulations, immortality is near.

If the sky is overcast with mist, the wind fierce, or the cold intense, do not draw in *qi*—only hold it closed. For those suffering from cold-heat disorders, or about to contract *yōngjū* (痈疽, festering sores), regardless of the time of day, regulate *qi* during the illness’s onset—within one meal’s interval—before symptoms appear. If the ailment does not improve, repeat the method the next day.

For *xīn lěng bìng* (心冷病, cold-heart disease), exhale the *qi* forcefully; for heat disease, blow it out. If the lungs are diseased, exhale with a *xū* (嘘) breath; if the liver, with a *hē* (呵) breath; if the spleen, with a *xī* (唏) breath; if the kidneys, with a *yè* (呬) breath.

At midnight, eighty-one breaths; at the crowing of the rooster, seventy-two; at dawn, sixty-three; at sunrise, fifty-four; at the *chén* hour (7–9 AM), forty-five; at the *wèi* hour (9 AM–11 AM), thirty-six. Before practicing this method, first perform *dǎoyǐn* (导引, guiding and drawing) exercises three hundred and sixty times on both sides.

There are four types of disease: *lěngbì* (冷痹, cold stagnation), *qìjí* (气疾, *qi* disorders), *yěfēng* (邪风, perverse winds), and *rèdú* (热毒, heat-toxins). For any afflicted, regulate *qi* with a tranquil mind—this method will never fail to heal.

All diseases originate from the five viscera. Each viscera has eighty-one kinds of ailments, and cold, heat, wind, and *qi* disorders combine to form four hundred and forty-four diseases. Study their similarities and differences, and master their distinctions.

Diseases of the heart: the body feels cold or hot.
Signs: The heart’s color is red; the afflicted dream of people in red clothing, wielding red blades and torches, coming to frighten them.
Treatment: Use *hū* (呼, exhalation) and *chuī* (吹, blowing) *qi*—exhalation for cold, blowing for heat.

Diseases of the lungs: the chest and back feel full and distended; the limbs are restless and weary.
Signs: The lungs’ color is white; the afflicted delight in dreaming of beautiful men and women, feigning affection and clinging to others, embracing them like kin—parents, siblings, spouses.
Treatment: Exhale with a *xū* (嘘) breath.

Diseases of the liver: melancholy, discontent, sorrowful thoughts, and headache or eye pain.
Signs: The liver’s color is green; the afflicted dream of people in green clothing, holding green blades, or lions, tigers, and wolves coming to terrify them.
Treatment: Exhale with a *hē* (呵) breath.

Diseases of the spleen: the body feels restless with *yóufēng* (游风, wandering wind); pain spreads across the limbs; weariness and agitation ensue.
Signs: The spleen’s color is yellow—akin to earth’s hue; the afflicted dream of children striking them with perverse, twisted stances, or of swirling winds forming into clusters.
Treatment: Exhale with a *xī* (唏) breath.

Diseases of the kidneys: the body feels cold, *yīn* (阴) energy declines, and the face and limbs wither.
Signs: The kidneys’ color is black; the afflicted dream of black-clad figures or beasts, holding blades and torches, coming to frighten them.
Treatment: Exhale with a *yè* (呬) breath.

For cold diseases, use forceful exhalation thirty times, then gentle exhalation ten times.»

**Breathing Methods:**
Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, letting sound follow breath—pronouncing the syllable as you exhale.

For heat diseases, use forceful blowing (*chuī* 吹) fifty times, then gentle blowing ten times.
Blowing should resemble the sound of blowing on an object, making the syllable’s sound and breath align.

For lung diseases, use forceful sighing (*xū* 嘘) thirty times, then gentle sighing ten times.
For liver diseases, use forceful *hē* (呵) thirty times, then gentle *hē* ten times.
For spleen diseases, use forceful *xī* (唏) thirty times, then gentle *xī* ten times.
For kidney diseases, use forceful *yàn* (咽) fifty times, then gentle *yè* (呬) thirty times.

These twelve methods of regulating *qi* must be practiced with reverence and care if one is ill—no ailment shall fail to heal.
All must first be accompanied by three hundred sixty repetitions of *daoyin* (导引) before application.

**Section on Nourishment and Dietary Therapy (Sixth Treatise):**
The text states:
In spring, one should take *Xiǎo Xùmìng Tang* (小续命汤) for five doses, along with various supplementary powders, each for one dose.
In summer’s intense heat, take *Shèn Lì Tang* (肾沥汤) for three doses.
In autumn, take *Huángqí* (黄耆) pills for one or two doses.
In winter, take medicinal wine for two or three doses. Cease upon the start of spring.

If this regimen is followed lifelong, all diseases shall never arise.

The common folk see only the lethal *gōuwěi* (钩吻) but do not trust *huángjīng* (黄精) in prolonging life.
They know only the five grains to sate hunger but do not recognize how a hundred herbs may save life.
They understand only laxatives for conception but cannot grasp how to preserve and nourish through restraint.

Thus, there are methods for nourishing with medicines.

**Idiom of Caution:**
When taking medicines, one must align with one’s innate nature and discern what suits cold or warmth.
Do not merely take what others use because it is potent.
Begin with herbal and plant medicines, then proceed to minerals—this is the broad principle of preparatory medicine.
This is the method of gradual refinement, from coarse to pure.

From youth to age, the body grows accustomed to the five grains; one cannot suddenly abandon them entirely.
Though medicines take time to show benefit, they do not immediately fill hunger. Yet, over years, they gradually solidify the bones and marrow, and the five grains may then be naturally reduced.
Nowadays, people seek immediate results, expecting swift responses. Before the organs are fortified, they abandon grains entirely, and though grain’s influence fades, the medicine has yet to take effect.
Again, they indulge in licentiousness, their form and spirit no different from the vulgar—thus, they bring ruin upon themselves. How strange!

The principles of nourishment with medicines must follow a strict order. Those who do not know this art not only harm their *yáng* (交) but also fail to harness its power.
Thus, the great method of nourishment requires first eliminating the three worms.

Once the three worms are gone, proceed to herbal medicines, then to wooden (bark/resin) medicines, and finally to mineral medicines.
Following this order allows the medicine’s nature to unfold fully, ensuring stability and longevity.

**Formula to Eliminate the Three Worms:**
Take three *dòu* (斗) of fresh *Rehmannia glutinosa* (生地黄) juice, simmered over east-facing stove reeds until three boilings occur. Add two *shāng* (升) of raw lacquer, stirring with a刑匕 (*xíngbì*) spoon, moving one *chǐ* (尺) daily.
Add three *liǎng* (两) of true cinnabar (*zhēndān* 真丹), then move another *chǐ*.
Add three *shāng* of pumpkin seed powder (*guāzǐ* 瓜子), then move another *chǐ*.
Add three *liǎng* of rhubarb powder (*dàhuáng* 大黄), simmering gently without burning. When formable, make pills the size of *wúzǐ* (梧子). Take one pill before meals, three times daily.
The turbid blood will discharge from the nose; in thirty days, all worms will expel. In fifty days, all diseases will heal, and the complexion will glow.

**Alternative Formula:**
Two *shāng* of lacquer,
Six *liǎng* of rhubarb, powdered,
One and a half *shāng* of wine,
Three *shāng* of *wújīngzi* (芜菁子, *isatis tinctoria* seeds), powdered.
Combine and simmer gently until pillable, forming *wúzǐ*-sized pills. Take three before meals.
In ten days, turbid blood will discharge from the nose; in thirty days, the worms will rot and expel. In fifty days, the body will glow, and mobility will rival a galloping horse, with stable *xiāoxī* (消息, ebb-and-flow) in the limbs—only then may one proceed to herbal medicines.
Other methods are detailed in the *Three Worms Treatise*, found in Volume Eighteen.

**Formula for *Tiānmén Dōng* (天门冬):**
Dry *Asparagus cochinchinensis* (*Tiānmén Dōng*) in the sun, pulverize, and sift.
Take one *fāngcùn* (方寸) spoonful after meals, three times daily.
Up to ten doses may be taken; especially beneficial for children. Mixing with pine resin (*sōngzhī* 松脂) or honey improves efficacy. The more, the better.

**Alternative Formula:**
Extract the juice, simmer gently to yield five *dòu*, then add one *dòu* of white honey and two *shāng* of toasted sesame powder (*húmá* 胡麻). Stir continuously without pause until pillable, then extinguish the fire. Mix with *dàdòu huáng* (大豆黄, soybean residue) to form a cake three *cùn* (寸) in diameter, half a *cùn* thick.
Take one cake daily, three times. Benefits appear after one hundred days.
This is the supreme method, encompassing all others.

**Another Method: Fermented Wine**
(Note: Original text references a formula in Volume Fourteen, omitted here.)

**Master Jiè’s Method (近二百岁而少):**
Royal Purple (*Huángfù Lóng* 皇甫隆) once recounted that Master Jiè, nearing two hundred yet youthful, took only *Tiānmén Dōng*—peeled, sliced, and dried—mixed with wine, one *fāngcùn* spoonful daily, three times. This prevents aging and strengthens the middle *qi*, curing all ailments.

*Tiānmén Dōng* grows in high mountain valleys. On Mount Tai, it is called *Yín Yáng Shí* (淫羊藿); on Mount Hē (中岳), *Tiānmén Dōng*; on Mount Háng (西岳), *Guǎn Sōng* (管松); on Mount Hú (南岳), *Bǎibù* (百部); on Mount Hǔ (北岳), *Wúbù Qù* (无不愈); in plains and hills, *Diān Jí* (颠棘).
Though named differently by region, they are one in essence.
The finest grows in northern shaded earth.

**Method of Finely Cut and Sun-Dried *Dìhuáng* (地黄):**
When finely chopped and dried under fierce sunlight, prolonged consumption grants longevity and multiplies vitality a hundredfold. It treats:
- *Xūláo* (虚劳, vacuity exhaustion) and severe injuries,
- Age-related decline, emaciation, and *piāngǔ* (偏枯, hemiplegia),
- *Fēngshī* (风湿, wind-dampness) numbness, *lěngbì* (冷痹, cold paralysis),
- Abdominal masses, malignant sores, carbuncles, and *làijí* (癞疾, leprosy),
- Severe cases where pus consumes the flesh, nasal collapse, and ulceration—
  consumption reveals *pítuō chóngchū* (皮脱虫出, parasitic exit through skin), restoring plump, radiant complexion.

It cures all ailments, including *yīnwěi* (阴痿, impotence), deafness, and dim vision.
Prolonged use darkens gray hair, regrows fallen teeth, extends life, and renders one waterproof.
After 200 days, tranquility replaces ailments; stiffness relaxes, weakness strengthens.
After 300 days, the body lightens; in three years, one outpaces galloping horses.
After six years, chronic abdominal diseases vanish.

**Method of *Dìhuáng* Pill (地黄方):**
Take 50 *jīn* of fresh *Dìhuáng*, pound and strain the juice, clarify, and simmer until halved. Add 5 *shāng* of white honey and 1 *shāng* of date pitch (*zǎozhī*), kneading until cohesive. Form pills as needed.
Daily dose: one pill (size of a chicken egg), three times. Restores luster and plumpness.

**Alternative Method:**
Take 10 *jīn* of finely chopped *Dìhuáng*, steep in 2 *dòu* of refined wine for three nights. Dry in sunlight, re-steep until wine is exhausted.
Combine with 1 *jīn* each of *Gāncǎo* (甘草), *Bājìtiān* (巴戟天), *Hòupò* (厚朴), *Qiánlù* (乾漆), and *Fùpénzǐ* (覆盆子), pulverize and sift. Post-meal, take with wine (1 *fāngcùn* spoon), three times daily. Increase to two spoons for rejuvenation, strength, and longevity.

---
**Method for Prepared *Dìhuáng* (熟地黄法):**
Harvest *Dìhuáng*, removing fibrous roots, leaves, and fine roots. Pound and strain the juice, soaking fatty soil in it. Steam in a sealed pot (covered with soil/millet to prevent leakage) for one hour, dry, and re-steep. Repeat until juice is exhausted, then dry.
Alternatively, slice and steam for half a day, periodically dousing with wine until saturated. Dry and form honey pills.

---
**Cultivation of *Dìhuáng* (种地黄法):**
Select fertile, loose, yellow-red soil. Plow deeply, especially in winter (reverse-plowing frozen earth is ideal).
Cut large, healthy *Dìhuáng* roots into 4–12 *fēn* segments (1 *hú* yields 1 *mǔ*). Plant in ridges spaced 1 *chǐ* apart in early spring. Weed and mound soil as it grows.
Harvest in September–October when leaves wilt. One *mǔ* yields ~20 *hú*.
Select thick roots, wash in cold water, trim fine roots, and dry thoroughly. Slice into 1-*cùn* pieces, steam in white grass-lined baskets (or sealed bags with soil) from dawn to dusk until pitch-black. If incomplete, repeat.
For pre-chopped roots, strain juice in copper pots into a thick syrup. Mix with *Dìhuáng* juice, dry, and repeat until juice is exhausted. Yield: ~1–2 *jīn* per 100 *jīn* fresh.
Harvest in August–September (avoid overripe roots). Steam with wine-sprayed layers for optimal juice extraction.

---
**Yellow Precocious (*Huángjīng*) Paste (黄精膏方):**
Take 1 *dàn* of *Huángjīng*, remove fibrous husks, wash clean, and chop. Steam until tender, press for juice, and boil off impurities to yield 1 *dòu*.
Add 3 *liǎng* of powdered *Gānjiāng* (乾姜) and 1 *liǎng* of *Guìxīn* (桂心), simmering until golden-brown. Cool, store in a dry vessel, and mix with 5 *hé* of wine. Take 2 *hé* pre-meal, twice daily.
Restores aged skin, brightens complexion, and renews hair color.
For prolonged use, mix with *Dàdòu* (大豆) powder and abstain from grains—no hunger or thirst, achieving immortality.

---
**Method of *Wūmá* (乌麻) Consumption:**
Take black-skinned *Wūmá* (真檀色), dampen with water (not soaking), steam until permeated, then dry. Repeat nine steams and poundings, removing outer skin. Pre-meal, take with water or wine (2 *fāngcùn* spoons), three times daily.
Gradually eliminates hunger; abstinence from grains prevents all diseases, extending life indefinitely.

---
**Method of *Bǎizǐ* (柏子) Consumption:**
Take 2 *shāng* of *Bǎizǐ* (柏子仁), pulverize, and steep in 4 *shāng* of refined wine until paste-like. Add 2 *shāng* of white honey and 3 *shāng* of date pitch, kneading into pills. Incorporate 1 *shāng* each of powdered *Qián Dìhuáng* (乾地黄) and *Báizhú* (白朮). Form pills the size of *wútóng* seeds (梧子). Take 30 pills, twice daily.
All ailments vanish in twenty days.

---
**Method of *Sōngzǐ* (松子) Consumption:**
Harvest on the 7th day of the 7th month (later yields fall). Take 1 *fāngcùn* spoon, three to four times daily (or 3 *hé* per dose).
After 100 days, the body lightens; after 200 days, one walks 500 *lǐ* daily. Abstain from grains to ascend as an immortal.
Quench thirst with water or mix with fat for consumption.
If pill-form, size of *wútóng* seeds; take 10 pills.

---
**Method of *Sōngzhī* (松脂) Consumption:**
Refine *Sōngzhī* (松脂) nine times, sift, and mix with honey in a sealed container (prevent wind exposure). Take one piece (size of a *bóqí* checker, 2 *cùn* long, 1 *cùn* wide), three times daily. Gradually increase to 1 *jīn* monthly.
Eliminates hunger and extends life.
Alternatively, mix with refined wine and honey into a syrup; take 1–2 *liǎng* to half a *jīn* daily.

**On the Selection and Consumption of *Sōngzhī* (松脂):**
The finest *Sōngzhī* (松脂) is taken from the resinous clusters beneath the bark of aged pine trees. Where the roots are injured or broken, hidden from the sun and moon, the collected resin is called *yīnzhī* (阴脂, "shade resin"), which is even superior.

In the East of Hēngshān (衡山), five hundred *lǐ* away, there stands a great pine, its girth thirty to forty *fēn* (围), abundant in resin. Another method: In the fifth month, carve the sunlit side of the pine (twenty-four trees) so that the resin flows downward, yielding half a *shēng* (升) per tree. Alternatively, boil the resin from the old, gnarled roots, which can also be used.

*The *Xiān Jīng* (仙经, "Immortal Scriptures") states:* If one habitually enters Hēngshān’s shade in the third month, collects the resin from pines unseen by the sun and moon, refines it, and consumes it, the immortals will come without being summoned. After one hundred days of consumption, one endures cold and heat; after two hundred days, the five *zàng* (五脏, "visceral organs") are nourished. After five years, one will see the Queen Mother of the West (*Xī Wángmǔ*, 西王母).

*The *Xiān Jīng* (仙经) further states:* Among the three hundred sixty-five mountains where stones bear fruit, only the resin from the shade of the pine in the *Mǎngǔ Yīn Huái* (满谷阴怀, "Resinous Valley of Concealment") is edible. This valley lies four hundred eighty *lǐ* east of Hēngshān’s ridge, then turns southward; after crossing its southern border and entering the valley fifty *lǐ*, one finds a stone city where white cranes dwell. To the east is a great rock forty *zhàng* (丈) high, resembling a white pine. Beneath it, two *zhàng* down, is a small cave; further east in the mountain is cinnabar (*dānshā*, 丹砂), which can be eaten. To the south, in the shaded depths, stands a massive pine, thirty *fēn* (围) in girth, with thirty trees hidden from the sun and moon—all suitable for collection and consumption.

**Method of Collecting *Sōngzhī* (松脂):**
At sunset, break the shaded side to extract its *gāo* (膏, "resinous sap"), and the sunlit side to extract its *zhī* (脂, "resin"). Divide the sap and resin equally; consuming them harmonizes one’s *shénlíng* (神灵, "spiritual essence").

Carve holes into the shaded and sunlit sides, each five *cùn* (寸) square and five *cùn* deep. Cover the holes with bark to prevent wind entry—for if wind enters, the resin becomes unusable. Collect the resin in spring and summer, then seal the holes tightly; coat them with mud to preserve their *qì* (气, "vital energy").

In the *Dānshā* (丹砂) Cave to the northeast, there is a shaded spring whose water can be drunk. This is where the *Hóngnóng Chē Jūn* (弘农车君) of the *Yuánfēng* (元封) era entered the mountain to consume *Sōngzhī*. After sixteen years, he descended to dwell in the eastern market of Cháng’ān (长安), often traveling to the *Qín Lǐng* (秦岭) via the *Shànggǔ Niútóu* (上谷牛头) Valley. Even in old age, he remained as vigorous as a man of thirty.

**Method of Refining *Sōngzhī* (松脂):**
Take seven *jīn* (斤) of pine resin and one *dàn* (石) of mulberry ash liquid. Boil the resin three times, then immerse it in cold water to congeal. Repeat the boiling process ten times in total; when the resin turns white, it is ready for consumption.

The valley now lies within the boundary of *Yōu Xiàn* (攸县), southeast of *Hēngzhōu* (衡州). This pine resin differs from that of the rest of the world.

**Method of Consuming *Fúlíng* (茯苓) with *Jià* (饵, "as tonic"):**
Take ten *jīn* of *fúlíng* (茯苓, "Poria"), remove its skin, steep in wine, seal tightly in a container, and store for eleven days. Remove, then consume in pieces the size of a *bóqí* checker, three times daily. Alternatively, take as powdered *fāngcùn* spoonfuls. Before consuming *fúlíng*, boil it four or five times in water, or steep it in water for six or seven days.

**Method of *Fúlíng* (茯苓) *Sū* (酥, "congealed resin"):**
Take five *jīn* of *fúlíng* (茯苓), boil in ash liquid once, then in *jiāngshuǐ* (浆水, "mucilaginous water") ten times, and in clear water ten times.
Take five *jīn* of pine resin (*Sōngzhī*), boil as above, but forty times per batch.
Take three *jīn* of white honey (*báimì*, 白蜜), simmer until all foam is gone.
Take five *jīn* of fresh *Tiānmén Dōng* (天门冬, "Asparagus root"), remove its heart and skin, dry in the sun, and pulverize.
Take three *jīn* each of beeswax (*là*, 蜡) and cow fat (*niú sū*, 牛酥), refined three times.

Combine these six ingredients, grind and sift each, then place them in a copper vessel over boiling water (*chóngtāng*, 重汤). First add the cow fat, then the beeswax, then the honey. When the mixture dissolves, stir continuously without pause, ensuring thorough blending. Transfer to a ceramic container, seal tightly, and prevent any leakage of *qì* (气).

The day before consumption, abstain from food. If fasting, first eat sumptuous, filling meals until satiated, then fast. Begin with two *liǎng* (两), then after twenty days, increase to four *liǎng*; after another twenty days, eight *liǎng*. Make the pills fine, and swallow them until they reach the lower throat. In the second phase, start with four *liǎng*, then after twenty days, eight *liǎng*; after another twenty days, two *liǎng*. In the third phase, begin with eight *liǎng*, then after twenty days, two *liǎng*; after another twenty days, four *liǎng*. Complete the process in one hundred eighty days. Afterward, take three pills daily for nourishment—whether or not one continues the regimen. Always dissolve the pills in cow fat and honey, and consume them with a *shēng* (升) of fine wine for optimal effect.

The mixture must be prepared on days corresponding to the *Sìshí Wángxiàng* (四时王相, "Four Seasons' Celestial Harmonies"), strictly avoiding days of *xíngshā* (刑杀, "punishment and slaughter"), *yàn* (厌, "taboo"), or the *Sìjī* (四激, "Four Forbidden")—these are days of great misfortune. This is the method of *Péngzǔ* (彭祖).

**Method of *Fúlíng* (茯苓) *Gāo* (膏, "congealed resin paste")** (*as recorded in the *Qiān Jīn Yì* (千金翼, "Wing of the Thousand Gold")*):
Remove the skin of *fúlíng* (茯苓) while cold.
Take twenty-four *jīn* of pine resin (*Sōngzhī*).
Take twelve *jīn* each of pine nut kernels (*Sōngzǐ Rén*, 松子仁) and cypress nut kernels (*Bǎizǐ Rén*, 柏子仁).

Refine all four ingredients as per their respective methods—pine and cypress kernels require no refining. Grind and sift them. Add twenty-four *shēng* (升) of white honey (*báimì*) to a copper vessel, and place it over boiling water (*chóngtāng*). Simmer gently with low fire for one day and one night. Add the ingredients in sequence, stirring until fully integrated. Continue simmering over low fire for seven days and seven nights, then form into pills the size of small dates. Take seven pills per dose, three times daily.

If one wishes to abstain from grains (*jué gǔ*), consume a full dose at once, and one will achieve a lightened body, clear vision, and eternal youth. This method is later found in some editions with additional *Fúlíng Sū* (茯苓酥), *Yǎo Rén Sū* (杳仁酥), and *Dìhuáng Sū* (地黄酥) recipes, though these are absent from the original texts. The *Qiān Jīn Yì* already contains them, so they are omitted here.

**Method of Consuming *Gǒuqǐ* (枸杞) Root:**
For cultivating *Virtue/Power* (*yǎngxìng*, 养性) and extending longevity (*xiálíng*, 遐龄).
Cut one *dàn* (石) of *gǒuqǐ* root, boil in twelve *dòu* (斗) of water (total one *dàn* of water). Reduce to six *dòu*, clarify, and simmer until three *shēng* (升) remain. Take one *dòu* of clean, dry small wheat (*xiǎomài*), steep in the juice overnight, dry in the sun twice, and repeat until the juice is fully absorbed. Dry completely, pulverize, and consume with wine in *fāngcùn* spoonfuls, twice daily. Prepare two doses in the second and eighth months annually, and one will never age throughout life.

**Method of *Gǒuqǐ* (枸杞) Wine:**
Take one hundred twenty *jīn* of *gǒuqǐ* root, cut, and boil in four *dàn* (石) of water from the *Dōngliú* (东流) River for one day and one night. Extract one *dàn* of clear juice, then steep it in *qū* (曲, "fermented grains") as in the household method of brewing wine.

「Take the clarified liquid and store it in a dry, non-leaking vessel. Add two *cāng* (斤) and a half of prepared *Rehmannia glutinosa* (*dìhuáng*), powdered *Cinnamomum cassia* bark (*guìxīn*), dried ginger (*gānjiāng*), *Alisma orientalis* (*zéxiè*), and *Sichuan peppercorn* (*shùjiāo*), each one *shēng* (升), and two *shēng* of powdered *Pachyrhizus erosus* (*shānglù*). Place these in a silk pouch, immerse it in the wine, seal tightly, and bury it three *chǐ* (尺) underground, covering the top securely.

After three *qī* (七) days, bathe, dress formally, and bow twice. At dawn on a *jiǎyín* (甲寅) day when the sun rises in the east, open the vessel. The wine will be red as gold.

Take half a *shēng* on an empty stomach in the morning. Within ten days, all ailments will be cured; within thirty days, scars will vanish.

For severe illnesses, mix one *shēng* of water with half a *shēng* of wine, and divide into five doses.

From *Thousand Gold Prescriptions* (*Qiān Jīn Yì*): If one wishes to consume stone, take two *shēng* of green-white river stones the size of dates or apricots, boil in three *shēng* of water until it reaches a single boil, then add half a *gē* (合) of this wine. The stone will soften in moments and can be eaten.

**Recipe for *Mica* (*Yúnmǔ*) Water to Cure All Illnesses:**

Take twenty *jīn* of high-grade white mica (*shàngbái yúnmǔ*), slice thinly, and wash it twice with eight *dòu* of dew water, dividing the process equally. Then, take two *dòu* of water to make a decoction, add ten *jīn* of *miáoliú* (芒硝, *mirabilite*), and steep the mica in wooden vessels for twenty days.

Place the mica in a silk pouch, hang it indoors where it is sheltered from wind and sun, and let it dry. Use water-soaked deerhide as a pouch, knead and press it until noon. Then, sift through fine silk to remove impurities, knead and press again until five *dòu* of fine powder are obtained. Discard the remainder.

Take one *dòu* of the powder, mix in two *jīn* of raw honey (*yáimì*), and stir until it resembles porridge. Place this mixture in a hollow bamboo tube, thinly coat the inside, seal the mouth with lacquer, and bury it six *chǐ* underground beneath the southern slope of a northern wall. In spring and summer, leave it buried for forty days; in autumn and winter, for thirty days. If the mixture remains unabsorbed, rebury it for another thirty days before retrieving it.

First, take one *gē* of water, mix in one *gē* of the medicine, and stir thoroughly before consuming, three times daily. Adjust the water temperature as needed. After ten days, the urine will turn yellow—this initially treats *láoqì* (labored *qi*), wind rashes (*fēngzhěn*), and similar ailments. By twenty days, internal cold and dampness will dissipate; by thirty days, decayed teeth will fall out, and new ones will grow.

After forty days, one will fear neither wind nor cold;
by fifty days, all ailments will be cured, complexion will brighten daily, and one attains longevity as an immortal sage.
This I have witnessed with my own eyes, hence I record it.

**Method for Refining Bell’s Milk Powder:**
Take one *jīn* of Bell’s milk (*zhōngrǔ*), regardless of thickness—only use the purest, whitest, and most luminous. If it does not meet these standards, it is unusable.
First, prepare an iron pot capable of holding four or five *dòu* of water as a furnace. Fill it with water, leaving three *cùn* of space at the top. Place the milk in a gold, silver, or glazed ceramic container—any vessel that can withstand use—then lower it into the pot so that the water submerges the container by over one *cùn*. Ensure it remains submerged; do not let it rise above the water.
Apply gentle heat continuously, day and night, without interruption. When the water nears depletion, replenish it with warm water. Every *zhōu* (two-hour period), remove the pot and wash both it and the milk. After seven days and seven nights, retrieve the milk, strain and dry it thoroughly, then place it in a ceramic mortar. Secure it with a jade pestle and grind it with a minimal amount of water for one day and night. Stir vigorously until the mixture becomes highly turbid, then let it settle and extract the turbid liquid. The coarser particles of milk will naturally sink to the bottom; the finer powder will remain suspended in the water. Strain out the coarse sediment, then regrind it according to the previous method. Repeat this process for five days and five nights until the milk is finely powdered. After decanting and drying the refined powder, grind it again in a silver mortar for one day. The ideal result is when it no longer dissolves in meat broth upon washing.

**Bell’s Milk Powder Decoction:**
For treating *xūlěi* (deficiency and emaciation), weakness in those over sixty, or general debility where one cannot eat—**Universal Remedy for a Hundred Ailments**—
*Shàngdàng* ginseng (3 *fèn*)
*Shíhé* (3 *fèn*)
Dried ginger (3 *fèn*)
Refined Bell’s milk powder (3 *liǎng*)

Combine the first three ingredients, grind them into a powder, and sift. Mix them evenly with the milk powder, dividing the total into nine doses. Take one dose in warm, diluted wine on an empty stomach in the morning, one at noon, and one in the evening.

After three days, continue this regimen. In total, for the duration of this medicine, limit intake to one and a half *shēng* of rice and one *shēng* of meat per three days. The meat and rice must be thoroughly cooked; avoid raw onions or fermented soybeans (*pǐ*).

**Question:** Why must one eat sparingly for three days and avoid overeating?
**Answer:** For three nights, the milk nourishes and supplements the viscera. If one overeats, the medicine will be expelled from the stomach, hence the restriction on full meals.

**Question:** Why must one not eat raw foods?
**Answer:** Consuming raw foods diminishes the medicine’s efficacy. Once the medicine’s power is weakened, the body’s fat and vitality are also impaired, hence the prohibition on raw foods.

**Question:** Why must one avoid onions and fermented soybeans?
**Answer:** Onions and fermented soybeans counteract the medicine, hence their exclusion.

After exhausting the three-day course of medicine, take three days to recover with broth-based meals as desired, but still avoid onions, fermented soybeans, and hard-to-digest foods. Once recovery is complete, resume the medicine as before until the entire *jīn* of milk is consumed. The resulting *qi* and vitality will become evident—though I cannot fully describe their effects.

Once mastered, this method can be scaled: ten *jīn*, twenty *jīn*, or as much as one wishes, with adjustments as needed.

**West Peak Sage’s *Língfēi* Powder:**
*Yúnmù* powder (1 *jīn*)
*Púfú* (8 *liǎng*)
Refined Bell’s milk powder
*Bózi* (cyperus seed) (7 *liǎng*)
Ginseng (*from Thousand-Gold Wings*) (7 *liǎng*)
*Xùduàn* (7 *liǎng*)
*Guìxīn* (7 *liǎng*)
Chrysanthemum (15 *liǎng*)
Dried *Dìhuáng* (12 *liǎng*)

Grind the nine ingredients into a powder. Take nineteen *jīn* of fresh *Tiānménwū* (asparagus tuber), extract its juice, and steep the powder in it. Place the mixture in a copper vessel and steam it with one *shí* and two *dòu* of glutinous rice. Once the rice is cooked, dry and grind it into a powder. Take one square *chǐ* dose daily with warm water.

After three days, strength doubles;
after five days, blood and vessels are fully replenished.

On the seventh day, the body feels light;
on the tenth day, the complexion glows with radiance;
by the fifteenth day, one can run as swiftly as galloping horses;
by the thirtieth day, night vision shines with light;
by the seventieth day, all white hair falls out, and the old teeth are shed.

Further, take twenty-one *chǐ* of white honey, pound it together with the powder in two hundred *zhú* (mortar strokes), and form pills the size of *tóngzi* (Chinese catalpa seeds)—eighty-one in total. Dry them in the sun, and the pills will gleam translucent as *shuǐjīng zhū* (crystal beads).

For those wishing to restore their hair and teeth, swallow seven pills daily, three times a day. Once taken, if the hair has not yet turned white and the teeth have not yet fallen out, simply consume the remaining **#14** (seventy-four pills), and after **#15** (three hundred) years, they will turn white as described. For those already white-haired, taking the medicine for seven hundred years will cause the teeth to fall out.

When entering the mountains, swallow seven pills daily and abstain from grains without feeling hunger.

Since obtaining this formula, I have nearly surpassed three *jì* (decades). Recently, my complexion has grown ever more beautiful and radiant, though I hesitated, doubting its efficacy. Over the years, I inquired extensively and found many renowned figures who, after taking this, experienced its power. Thus, I followed the method as prescribed.

But if one persists in practicing it without ceasing, the benefits will not be in vain.

**Nurturing the Nature (养性)**
The **Yellow Emperor’s Miscellaneous Prohibitions** (黄帝杂忌法), **Section Seven (第七)**

Upon waking, do not open your eyes or wash your face—this causes **dullness of vision (目涩)**, loss of sight (**失明**), and excessive tears (**饶泪**).
At dawn, speak only of virtuous deeds (**善事**), avoiding wicked words (**恶言**). If you hear of wickedness, spit three times in the direction from which it came—this brings **auspiciousness (吉)**.
Do not harbor anger (**嗔怒**), nor shout or bellow (**叱咤咄呼**), nor sigh or lament (**嗟叹**), nor sing or wail (**唱**). To do so invites **disaster (请祸)**.

Do not stand with knees crossed, nor sit with arms crossed over your knees, nor let your hair cover your face—all these are **inauspicious (不祥)**.
Do not raise your foot toward fire, nor curse **Jìn (晋)** while facing the stove.

In all your movements—walking, standing, or sitting—do not turn your back to the sun (**日**), for this is **auspicious (吉)**.
Do not sit facing north (**北**) and ponder deeply—this leads to **inauspicious consequences (不祥起)**.

Whenever you set out, keep the **Arca Major (魁纲)** above your head—all directions will be **auspicious (吉)**.
If you intend to wage battle, hold the **handle of the Big Dipper (斗柄)** before you and point it at the enemy—this brings **auspiciousness (吉)**.
Do not wear your **headgear (冠带)** while facing north—this is **ominous (凶)**.
Do not spit toward the **west-north (西北)**, for this offends the **Arca Major (魁纲)**—**ominous (凶)**.
Do not cough or spit forcefully—spittle should not be cast far, lest it cause **lung disease (肺病)**, heaviness in the limbs (**手足重**), back pain (**背痛**), or coughing (**咳嗽**).
Nor should you urinate or defecate toward the **west-north (西北)**.

Do not kill **turtles or snakes (龟蛇)**.
Do not gaze angrily at the sun or moon (**日月**)—this may cause those who see it to lose their sight (**失明**).
When traveling or riding a horse, do not look back—this allows your **spirit (神)** to depart, leaving you vulnerable to **ghostly afflictions (鬼行踖粟)**.

When passing by a **sacred temple (神庙)**, be cautious not to enter hastily. If you enter, do so with **reverence (恭敬)**, without gazing about freely (**举目恣意顾瞻**). Treat it as you would a **stern sovereign (严君)**, for only then will you receive its blessings (**福**). Otherwise, you will swiftly invite its calamities (**祸**).
Nor should you turn your head to look back at the temple (**返首顾视神庙**).

If you suddenly see a **dragon or snake (龙蛇)**, do not let it arouse fear or curiosity (**兴心惊怪**). Do not stare intently (**注意瞻视**).
If you encounter **ghostly apparitions or strange transformations (鬼怪变异之物)**, suppress your reaction and do not be alarmed—recite the charm:
*"Seeing the strange without fear, the strange itself will decay (见怪不怪，其怪自坏)."*

If you encounter a **remarkably beautiful woman (殊妙美女)** while traveling or in a crowd, beware not to gaze upon her with **longing (熟视而爱之)**. Such beings are **arcs or spirits (魑魅)**, causing deep attachment (**深爱**). Whether in **remote mountains or open fields (空山旷野)** or among **dense crowds in broad places (稠人广众)**, they act the same.

Wherever there are **sandy gnats (沙虱)** in mountains or waters, do not bathe there—it harms the person (**害人**).
If you wish to cross a river, follow behind a **donkey or horse (驴马)** and cross swiftly—this avoids harm (**不伤人**).
Where **water arrows (水弩)** lurk, shooting a person’s shadow results in death (**射人影即死**). If you wish to cross such waters, strike the surface with an object—this causes the **water arrows to scatter (其弩即散)**—and cross quickly to avoid harm (**急渡不伤**).

In all **mountains with caves or holes (孔穴)**, those who enter to gather treasures (**采宝**) must do so only in the **third or ninth month (三月九月)**. In other months, the **mountains close, and conflicting *qi* (气交犯)** leads to death (**死**).

When **hungry or empty-stomached (空腹)**, do not look upon a corpse (**尸**). If **foul *qi* (臭气)** enters your nose, a **white coating (白)** will appear on your tongue, and your breath will always be foul (**口常臭**). If you must see a corpse, first drink alcohol (**饮酒**) to ward off **poisonous and malevolent influences (毒凶#1)**.

If you touch **heat (热)**, or if you encounter a river along the way, do not wash your face—this causes **wild hair (乌野)**.

**Chamber Arts: Supplementary Methods (房中补益), Section Eight (第八)**.

「The Treatise states: Those under the age of forty often indulge in excess; once past forty, one suddenly perceives that the **Dao/Way** and **qi** have weakened. Once this decline sets in, myriad ailments arise. If left untreated for long, they become incurable. Hence, the Master Pengzu said: *"To cure a man with a man is to attain the true essence of truth."* Therefore, upon reaching forty, one must understand the **Chamber Arts (房中)****.

The **Chamber Arts (房中)** are a **Dao/Way** close at hand, yet few can practice it. Its method—consummating with ten women in a single night, sealing and preserving with utmost care—exhausts the **Chamber Arts (房中)****. Combined with medicinal tonics, if one never ceases in all four seasons, the **Dao/Way** and **qi** will be multiplied a hundredfold, and wisdom will renew itself daily. Yet, this technique is not devised to gratify lustful desires or seek fleeting pleasure, nor to indulge in **female charms (女色)** for emotional release. Its intent is to **nourish life (补益)** and dispel illness. This is the subtle essence of the **Chamber Arts (房中)****.

Thus, those under forty who take **Chamber Arts (房中)** tonics do so to hasten their misfortune—be cautious, be cautious! Therefore, one should not discuss the **Chamber Arts (房中)** with those not yet forty. If their **desire (欲心)** persists and they take both tonics and supplements, their **qi** and vitality will be depleted twice as fast, and within half a year, their **essence (精)** and **marrow (髓)** will be exhausted, bringing them near to death. Youth must be especially vigilant.

Once past forty, if one constantly **preserves the essence (固精)** and **nourishes the qi (养气)**, without depletion, they may avoid aging. Moreover, consuming **cloud mother (云母)** can cure ailments and prolong life. Those past forty must not take **purgative medicines (泻药)****, but should instead consistently consume **tonics (补药)**—this is most excellent.

In antiquity, the Yellow Emperor consummated with twelve hundred women and ascended to the **Dao/Way (仙)****, yet common folk perish from a single union. How vast is the difference between those who know and those who do not! For those who grasp the **Dao/Way (道)****, the number of unions is not excessive. Any woman, regardless of beauty, suffices if they are young, unchilded, have ample flesh, and are vigorous.

If one possesses sufficient wealth, they should select women with fine, black-and-white distinct hair, clear eyes, supple bodies, soft bones, smooth and delicate skin, harmonious voices, and limbs where the flesh is plentiful yet the bones are not too large. Their armpits and bodies should have no coarse hair; if present, it must be soft and fine. Avoid those with:
- **Disheveled hair and filthy faces (蓬头蝇面)**,
- **Thick necks and swollen throats (槌项结喉)***,
- **Deep voices and gaping mouths (雄声大口)***,
- **Prominent noses and uneven teeth (高鼻麦齿)***,
- **Clouded eyes (目精浑浊)***,
- **Coarse hair in the mouth or chin (口颔有毫)***,
- **Tall bones and joints (骨节高大)***,
- **Yellow hair and scant flesh (发黄少肉)***,
- **Rough, dense, and strong hair (隐毫多而且强)***,
- **Or hair growing in reverse (逆毫)***.

These traits are detrimental to life and longevity.

The **Dao/Way (道)** of consummating with women requires that one does not act when their **qi** is unaroused and weak. Instead, one must first **gradually attune and harmonize (徐徐调和)****, ensuring the **spirit (神)** and **intent (意)** are fully engaged. After a prolonged union, one may then draw in **yin qi (阴气)****, which, once received, will naturally strengthen within moments. This is the principle of *"weakly inviting within, forcefully expelling without"*—advancing and retreating must be **spaced and measured (疏迟)****, and one must cease when passion surges. Do not **hurl oneself recklessly (高自投掷)****, lest the five **viscera (脏)** be disordered, the **essence-vessels (精脉)** be severed, and a hundred **ailments (病)** be incurred. Yet, if one engages repeatedly with **diligent restraint (慎密)****, all diseases will be cured, life prolonged, and the **Dao/Way (仙)** near at hand—not necessarily adhering to the numbers nine, one, three, or five. One who can consummate with a hundred women without **depleting the essence (施泻)**** will achieve longevity.

If one consummates with many women, they may **harvest *qi* (采气)****. The **Dao/Way (道)** of **harvesting *qi* (采气)**** is to deeply penetrate without movement, allowing the **qi** to gather and heat above. When the warmth reaches the mouth, one should **align and draw (相当)****, inhaling the woman’s **yin qi (阴气)****. This can be done with **measured advances and retreats (疏疏进退)****, stopping when passion stirs. One should then **breathe softly, close their eyes, and rest (缓息眠目)****, lying down to **guide the *qi* internally (道引)****. Their body will grow stronger, enabling them to consummate with another woman. By frequently changing partners, one gains greater benefit. If one remains with a single woman, their **yin qi (阴气)** weakens, and the benefit is diminished.

The **yang Dao/Way (阳道)** follows the principle of **fire (法火)****, while the **yin realm (阴家)** follows the principle of **water (法水)****. Water can subdue fire, yet if **yin qi (阴气)** persistently consumes **yang qi (阳气)****, the latter will eventually weaken. The loss will outweigh the gain. If one can consummate with twelve women without **depleting the essence (施泻)****, they will never age and retain beauty. If they consummate with ninety-three women while **preserving the essence (固精)****, they will live a hundred thousand years.

When **essence (精)** is scarce, illness follows; when it is exhausted, death ensues. This must be pondered, this must be guarded against. If one engages repeatedly yet **depletes the essence (一泻)****, their **essence and *qi* (精气)** will grow, though slowly—this cannot prevent **vital exhaustion (虚)****. If one does not engage often but **depletes the essence (即泻)**** upon consummation, they gain no benefit. The **essence and *qi* (精气)** will naturally regenerate, but their growth is sluggish compared to the swiftness of **frequent consummation without depletion (数交接不泻)****.

When one practices **consummation (交合)****, they should **inhale deeply through the nose (鼻多内气)**** and **exhale subtly through the mouth (口微吐气)****. This alone brings benefit. After the union, if one **steams the body with heat (蒸热)****, this confirms the **harvesting of *qi* (得气)****. Using **three parts (三分)** of **glory grass powder (昌蒲末)**** and **one part (一分)** of **white rice powder (白粱粉)****, applied to the body and allowed to dry, will enhance vigor and prevent **moist sores (湿疮)****.

For those who must **deplete the essence (施泻)****, they should **close their mouth and open their eyes (闭口张目)****, **seal their *qi* (闭气)****, and **clench both fists (握固两手)****. Drawing in **qi** through **nose-contraction (缩鼻)****—upward, downward, left, and right—while also **contracting the lower body (缩下部)**** and **inhaling the abdomen (吸腹)****, they should **slightly arch their back (小偃脊膂)****. With their left hand’s middle two fingers, they must **press the Screened Aperture Acupoint (屏翳穴)****. Then, they should **prolonged exhale (长吐气)**** and **grind their teeth a thousand times (琢齿千遍)****, causing the **essence to ascend and nourish the brain (精上补脑)****, thus achieving longevity. If **essence** is **recklessly expelled (精妄出)****, it will **diminish the spirit (损神)****.

The *Scripture of the Dao/Way (仙经)* states: *"To achieve longevity without aging, first play with a woman, then drink **jade nectar (玉浆)***. **Jade nectar (玉浆)*** is the **oral fluid (口中津)***. One should **stimulate mutual arousal (感动)****, using the left hand to grasp, and **meditate on the elixir field (丹田)****, where **red *qi* (赤气)** resides internally—**yellow outside, white within (内黄外白)****, transforming into the **sun and moon (日月)****, revolving within the **elixir field (丹田)****. Both should enter the **muddy wall (泥垣)****, merging into a single **cause (因)****. One must **seal their *qi* deeply (闭气深内)****, allowing no **inhalation or exhalation (出入)****. Instead, they should **swallow *qi* gradually (徐徐咽气)****, rising and falling. When passion stirs and **essence** is about to be expelled, one must **quickly withdraw (急退之)***.»

This is not the practice of the highest sages or the wise—only they can accomplish it.

The **elixir field (丹田)** lies three *cùn* below the navel; the **muddy wall (泥垣)** is within the head, directly inward from between the eyes. Visualize the **sun and moon (日月)** merging into a sphere three *cùn* in diameter, their two halves blending into one—this is the union of the **sun and moon (日月)**. Even as they move in and out, one must persist in contemplating their form without ceasing—this is ideal.

It is further said: The **Dao/Way (道)** of mutual transcendence for men and women lies in deeply restraining **essence (精)**, meditating on the **red *qi* (赤色)** in the navel, as large as a chicken’s egg. Then, one should gradually inhale and exhale, withdrawing when passion stirs. A daily practice of dozens of repetitions will extend one’s lifespan.

Both partners should calm their minds and focus together, concentrating fiercely. In the method of **copulation (御女)**, if one can release twice in a month, or twenty-four times a year, they will attain two hundred years of life, with youthful vigor and no illness. If **elixir arts (药)** are added, then **longevity (长生)** is possible.

For those aged twenty, release every four days; at thirty, every eight days; at forty, every sixteen days; at fifty, every twenty days; at sixty, **restrain essence (闭精)** and refrain from release. If vitality remains strong, one may release once a month. Though some may naturally possess **qi** and strength beyond others, they must not suppress release for too long, lest **boils and abscesses (痈疽)** arise.

If one is past sixty and has not engaged in intercourse for several *xún*, yet feels no disturbance in mind, they may naturally **seal and restrain (闭固)**.

In the past, during the reign of **Zhèngguān (正观)**, an old villager over seventy years old came to me and said: *"For several days now, my **yang *qi* (阳气)** has grown stronger. I thought my **qi** and blood had already declined—how can this vigor persist? I do not know if this is a blessing or a curse in my old age."* I replied: *"This is an omen of grave misfortune."*

You have not heard of the **wax candle**? When the wax candle is about to burn out, it must first grow dim and then flare up brightly—once the light fades, it is extinguished. Now, your age has reached the **twilight years of life (桑榆)**; you ought to have long since **sealed essence (闭精)** and restrained desire. Yet suddenly, your **spring passion (春情)** surges violently—is this not contrary to nature? I secretly fear for you; take heed! After four *xún*, you fell ill and died. This is the consequence of negligence.

Such cases are not singular. I recount this to warn those who follow.

Those who practice **proper life-nurturing (善摄生)** must, whenever they feel **yang vitality (阳事)** surge, restrain it with caution—never indulge recklessly and exhaust oneself. If you can master it once, then once the **fire is quenched (火灭)**, once more the **oil is replenished (增油)**. But if you cannot restrain yourself, indulging in dissipation, then the **wax candle is nearing its end (膏火将灭)**, and the oil is being consumed—how can you not guard against this with utmost care?

The tragedy is that people in their youth do not know this, and even if they do, they do not believe or act upon it. By the time they grow old and understand, it is too late—the disease is hard to cure. Even if one preserves oneself in old age, one may still prolong life and vitality. But if one practices the **Dao (行道)** in youth and vigor, **immortality (神仙)** comes swiftly.

Someone may ask: *"Before sixty, can one not **seal essence and maintain unity (闭精守一)**?"*

No. A man cannot do without a woman, nor a woman without a man. Without a woman, desire stirs—desire stirred exhausts the **spirit (神)**; the **spirit** exhausted shortens life. If one can truly think of nothingness, that would be ideal—**eternal life (长生)**. Yet this is almost impossible. Forcing suppression and restraint is difficult to maintain and easy to fail, leading to **seminal leakage (漏精)** and **cloudy urine (尿浊)**, even inviting **ghostly intercourse (鬼交)**, harming one’s vitality a hundredfold.

As for **dietary and medicinal regimens (服食药物)**, refer to the separate volumes.

**Methods for consorting with a woman (御女之法)**:
One must avoid **homogeneous days (丙丁日)**, as well as the **new and full moons (弦望)**, **eclipses (晦朔)**, and times of **great wind, great rain, great fog, extreme cold, extreme heat, thunder, lightning, or celestial obscurity (天地晦冥)**. If one consorts during **solar or lunar eclipses (日月薄蚀)**, or under **rainbows (虹霓)**, during **earthquakes (地动)**, or in the presence of **firelight, celestial bodies, temples, or near wells, kitchens, latrines, tombs, or corpses (井灶圊厕、冢墓尸柩)**, it harms the **spirit (神)**, bringing misfortune. It harms the man a hundredfold, causes the woman to fall ill, and if she bears children, they will be **epileptic, deaf, blind, lame, or born with deformities (癫痴顽愚、喑痘聋聩、孪跛盲眇)**, short-lived, and unfilial.

If one consorts **according to the Dao (如法)**, there will be **blessings and virtue (福德)**. Wise and benevolent beings will descend into the womb, refining the parents’ **nature and conduct (性行)**, making their actions harmonious and their household prosperous, with **auspicious omens (祥瑞)** abounding. But if done improperly, there will be **scant blessings, folly, and malevolent spirits** descending into the womb, corrupting the parents’ **nature and conduct**, causing their deeds to fail, their household to decline, and misfortunes to strike repeatedly. Even if they live and grow, their **lineage and nation will perish**.

The responses of **calamity and fortune (祸福)** are as certain as **echoes (影响)**. This is an inevitable truth—how can it be reconsidered?

If one seeks to **beget children (求子)**, then...

But wait—after the woman’s menstruation has ceased, one must choose the first, third, or fifth day thereafter, selecting days that are **Royal and Auspicious Days (王相日)** and when the **lunar mansion (月宿)** aligns with a **Noble Abode (贵宿)**, then performing the **release of vital essence (施泻)** after midnight. If done thus, the child born will be male, long-lived, and endowed with wisdom and high rank.

If the **release of vital essence (施泻)** is performed on the second, fourth, or sixth day after menstruation ceases, the child born will be female.

After the sixth day, one must not perform the **release of vital essence (施泻)**—if done so, not only will no child be conceived, but even if born, the child will not thrive.

**Royal and Auspicious Days (王相日):**
Spring: **Jia (甲)** and **Yi (乙)**

Summer: **Bing (丙)** on **Wu (午)**, **Ding (丁)** on **Si (巳)**
Autumn: **Geng (庚)** on **Shen (申)**, **Xin (辛)** on **You (酉)**
Winter: **Ren (壬)** on **Zi (子)**, **Gui (癸)** on **Hai (亥)**
—and these coincide with the above **Lunar Mansion Days (月宿日)**, the effect is even more beneficial.

The **Yellow Emperor’s Miscellaneous Prohibitions (黄帝杂禁忌法)** state:
If one is enraged and **vital essence and blood (血气)** remain unsettled, then engaging in intercourse will cause **boils and abscesses (痈疽)**.

One must not engage in intercourse while suppressing the urge to urinate, as this will cause **dysuria (淋)**, pain in the penis, and **pallor of the face (面失血色)**. Additionally, if one enters the chamber after long travel and exhaustion, this is **five types of labor and depletion (五劳虚损)**, leading to few children.

Moreover, if intercourse occurs before a woman’s menstruation has fully ceased, it will cause illness and result in **leukoderma (白驳)**.

One must not bring **mercury (水银)** near the **yin (阴)**, as it will cause **consumption and atrophy (消缩)**.

The fats of **deer and swine (鹿、猪二脂)** must not be brought near the **yin (阴)**, as this will cause **erectile dysfunction (阴痿)**.

**The *Píngmài* [平脉, "Level/Even Pulse"] Method**

**Section 1: The Great Principle of Even Pulse**
The text states: *"The pulse is the foundation of the medical profession. If one does not deeply investigate its Dao/Way, how can one truly be a physician? Thus, the wise physicians of antiquity, in waking and in sleep, in reverence and in casualness, never acted like ordinary people. Even in haste, they were mindful of medicine; even in adversity, they were mindful of medicine. Therefore, they could resonate with spirits and deities, harmonize with Heaven and Earth, save the masses, and serve as dependable guides. If they were to mix with common folk and lose their focus, all matters would collapse—how could the myriad beings then look up to them?"*

From this, it is clear that students must abandon mundane emotions, concentrate their minds here, and thus the *Hé-Què* [和鹊, "Harmonious Crow"] efficacy will be achieved.

The *Classics* say: *"The method of pulse diagnosis should always be performed at the prime of dawn (平旦, *píngdàn*), when the yin-qi has not yet stirred, the yang-qi has not yet dispersed, no food or drink has been taken, the Jingmai [经脉, "Channel Pulses"] are not yet full, the Luomai [络脉, "Collateral Pulses"] are balanced, and the vital energies (气) and blood are not yet disordered. Only then can one diagnose pulses that deviate from the norm."* The *Pulse Classic* (《脉经》) states: *"Any deviation from this is incorrect."* When diagnosing, one should press the pulse gently (切脉动), then quietly observe its clarity (静而视精明), examine the five colors (察五色), and assess the excess or deficiency of the five Zàng [五脏, "solid organs"] and the strength or weakness of the six Fǔ [六腑, "hollow organs"], as well as the flourishing or decline of the body’s form. These observations should be cross-referenced (参互), determining the fate of life and death.

It further states: *"For diagnosing even pulses (平脉者), all should be done at dawn (平旦). Do not eat or speak; harmonize and adjust the body’s vital energies (消息体气). If any action must be taken, it should be as brief as the time it takes to eat. The physician should follow this rule as well. After establishing the rhythm, first diagnose the Cùnkǒu [寸口, "Wrist Pulse"]. Initially, press firmly with the fingers to reach the bone (初重指切骨), and once the rhythm is set, gradually lift the fingers (便渐举指), ensuring they neither press too thickly nor too lightly (令指不厚不薄), aligning with the skin and fur (与皮毛相得), like the weight of three *sù* beans [三菽]. Between light and firm pressure, adjust according to the patient’s strength, weakness, fatness, or thinness (随人强弱肥瘦), using one’s intent to modulate the pressure (以意消息进退). The pressing and lifting should be appropriate (举按之宜), matching the pulse’s floating or sinking (称其浮沉诸类) and corresponding to the four seasons and five phases (应於四时五行), aligning with the patient’s five Zàng [五脏]. If not, the pulse’s lightness or heaviness will be misjudged (以其轻重相薄), and one may incorrectly diagnose cold or heat, gain or loss (寻状论寒暑得失)."*

The vital energies (气) and pulse (脉) of all people follow the rhythm of day and night, adapting to the four seasons. Yet, even as the pulse’s rise and fall (呼吸) correspond to the five *zhì* [至, "arrivals"] within the regulated breath (定息), there is no deficiency or excess. This is like the sundial’s (晷) varying strokes (刻) across the four seasons, yet the annual tally of days remains complete.

If a person is weak or robust, their breathing may be constrained or forceful, but the degree of their daytime and nighttime breaths will still follow the *lòukè* [漏刻, "water clock strokes"]. This is called *"the pulse’s breathing follows day and night, adapting to the four seasons."* When diagnosing the pulse, one must first use intent to harmonize and adjust (消息), suppress the patient’s breathing to match one’s own (压取病人呼吸以自同), and then observe the pulse’s rhythm (察其脉数), counting it within the regulated breath (计於定息之限). Five *zhì* [至] indicate an even pulse (平人). If there is any contraction or expansion, one should investigate the pulse’s characteristics to determine the appropriate source of the illness (寻状论病源之所宜).

**Question:** What is meant by the *"three divisions of the pulse"* (三部脉)?

**Answer:** The Cùn [寸], Guān [关], and Chǐ [尺].

Since people’s arms vary in length, their forms differ. There is a method to divide the pulse into three parts: from the horizontal crease at the elbow (肘腕中横文) to the web of the hand (掌鱼际后文), measure ten *fēn* [分], then enter six *fēn* inward—this is the Chǐ [尺]. From the web of the hand (鱼际后文), measure ten *fēn* inward—this is the Cùn [寸]. From the ten *fēn* inward, measure six *fēn* inward—this is the Cùnkǒu [寸口]. The bone here is naturally elevated, so it is said that yin-qi reaches one *cùn* inside the Chǐ [尺], and yang-qi reaches nine *fēn* inside the Cùn [寸]. From the Cùnkǒu [寸口], measure six *fēn* inward to reach the Guān [关], and from the Guān [关], measure six *fēn* inward to reach the Chǐ [尺].

It is also said: *"From the web of the hand to the high bone, measure one *cùn* inward—this is the Cùnkǒu [寸口]. From the Cùnkǒu [寸口] to the Chǐ [尺] is named Chǐzé [尺泽], hence the term 'Cùn-Chǐ [尺寸].' The region between the Cùn [寸] and Chǐ [尺] is called the Guān [关], where yang-qi emerges and yin-qi enters, marking the boundary like the three realms of Heaven-Earth-Human (天地人为三界). The Cùn [寸] governs the upper *Jiāo* [焦, "burner"], the head, and the skin and fur, extending to the upper arm (竟手上部); the Guān [关] governs the middle *Jiāo* [焦], the abdomen, and the waist (腹及腰中部); the Chǐ [尺] governs the lower *Jiāo* [焦], from the lower abdomen to the feet (小腹至足下部). This is the method of the three divisions, mirroring the three *Cái* [才, "talents"] of Heaven-Earth-Human, with the head, abdomen, and feet as the three *Yuán* [元, "origins"]."*

**Section 2: Diagnosing the Light and Heavy Pulses of the Five Zàng [Solid Organs]**
The *Classics* state: *"When first holding the pulse, with the pressure like that of three *sù* beans [三菽] and aligning with the skin and fur (与皮毛相得), this corresponds to the Lung (肺部). Metal (金), autumn’s third month, the qi of *Gēng-Xīn* [庚辛]. With the pressure like that of six *sù* beans [六菽] and aligning with the blood vessels (与血脉相得), this corresponds to the Heart (心部). Fire (火), summer’s third month, the qi of *Bǐng-Dīng* [丙丁]. With the pressure like that of nine *sù* beans [九菽] and aligning with the muscles (与肌肉相得), this corresponds to the Spleen (脾部)."*

**Diagnosing the Light and Heavy Pulses of the Five Zàng [Solid Organs] (continued)**

Earth (土), the *Wáng* [王, "sovereign"] of the four seasons, the season of late summer (季夏, *sixth month*), the *qi* of *Wù-Jǐ* [戊己]. With the pressure like that of twelve *sù* beans (十二菽之重) and aligning with the sinews (與筋平), this corresponds to the Liver (肝部).

Wood (木), spring’s third month, the *qi* of *Jiǎ-Yǐ* [甲乙]. When pressed to the bone (按之至骨) and lifted swiftly (舉之來疾), this corresponds to the Kidney (腎部). Water (水), winter’s third month, the *qi* of *Rén-Guǐ* [壬癸].

How does one distinguish when the Heart (心) and Lung (肺) pulses are both floating?
Thus it is taught: When floating and widely dispersed (浮而大散), it is the Heart (心); resembling the *qi* of Fire (火) in its floating and dispersing. When floating and short or rough (浮而短涩), it is the Lung (肺); adhering to the law of Metal (金) in its stinginess and roughness.

How does one distinguish when the Kidney (腎) and Liver (肝) pulses are both sinking?
Thus it is taught: When firm and long (牢而長), it is the Liver (肝); like a sprout emerging and thrusting forth its grain. When pressed softly (按之軟) and lifted to reveal a solid pulse beneath (舉指來實), it is the Kidney (腎). Moist yet weak like water (濡弱如水), but when lifted, it overcomes the weight of a boat (舉重勝船).

The Spleen (脾) is the central state, so its pulse lies in the middle—this is the pulse of *yin* and *yang*.

The *Thousand Gold Pieces Canon* (*千金翼*) states: *"When slow, slack, and long (迟缓而長), it is the Spleen (脾)."*

**Pulse Forms by Finger Pressure (指下形状)**

Floating pulse (浮脉): When lifted, it remains; when pressed, it vanishes. It floats beneath the fingers.

Sinking pulse (沉脉): When lifted, it vanishes; when pressed, it remains. It requires firm pressure to detect.

Rough pulse (涩脉): Fine and slow (細而迟), difficult to traverse, and dispersed. Sometimes it stops and returns again. Also called: *"floating yet short"* (浮而短), *"short yet stopping"* (短而止), or *"dispersed"* (散).

Slippery pulse (滑脉): When traversing, it moves forward and backward swiftly, flowing smoothly and turning with ease, resembling the rapidity of counting. Also called: *"floating with a bead-like sensation beneath the fingers"* (浮中如有丸), *"scattered as if about to slip away"* (洒洒如欲脱).

Bounding pulse (洪脉): Extremely large beneath the fingers. Also called: *"floating yet large"* (浮而大).

Fine pulse (细脉): Small in scale, yet consistently present—only fine in texture.

Faint pulse (微脉): Extremely fine and soft, sometimes almost vanishing, as if present yet absent. Also called: *"small"* (小), *"swift beneath the hand"* (手下快), *"thin"* (薄), or *"when pressed, it seems about to exhaust"* (按之如欲尽).

Taut pulse (弦脉): When lifted, it vanishes; when pressed, it feels like a drawn bowstring. Also called: *"like a drawn bowstring, unyielding when pressed"* (如张弓弦，按之不移), *"floating yet tense as a bowstring"* (浮紧弓为弦).

Tense pulse (紧脉): Rapid like cutting through silk. Also called: *"like a turning rope, irregular in motion"* (如转索之无常).

Slow pulse (迟脉): When three breaths are taken, it arrives and departs extremely slowly. Also called: *"when lifted, it vanishes; when pressed, it feels firm and solid"* (举之不足，按之尽牢), *"when pressed, it feels firm and solid; when lifted, it vanishes"* (按之尽牢，举之无有).

Numerous pulse (数脉): When it arrives and departs in haste. Also called: *"six or seven beats per breath"* (意六七至), *"numerous pulse is named rapid"* (数者进之名).

Slack pulse (缓脉): When it arrives and departs slowly, yet slightly faster than a slow pulse (小鴂於迟). Also called: *"floating, large, and soft, with yin and yang pulses appearing together"* (浮大而软，阴与阳同着).

Weak pulse (弱脉): Extremely soft and sinking, fine in texture. When pressed, it nearly vanishes beneath the fingers. Also called: *"only detected when pressed firmly; when lifted, it disappears"* (按之乃得，举之即无).

Moving pulse (动脉): Appears above the *guān* [关, "barrier"], without distinct head or tail, large as a bean, trembling and shaking.

Hidden pulse (伏脉): Extremely deep, only detected when the fingers press against the bone. Also called: *"sinking above the guān without emerging"* (关上沉不出), *"firm beneath the hand"* (手下裁动), *"when pressed, it vanishes; when lifted, it disappears"* (按之不足，举之无有).

Knotted pulse (芤脉): Floating, large, and soft. When pressed, the center is hollow, while the sides feel solid. Also called: *"no pulse beneath the fingers, yet pulses appear on both sides"* (指下无，两傍有).

Soft pulse (软脉): Extremely soft and floating, fine in texture. Also called: *"when pressed, it vanishes; when lifted, it remains"* (按之无有，举之有余), *"fine and soft"* (細小如软). The *Thousand Gold Pieces Canon* (*千金翼*) renders this as *"moist"* (濡).

Empty pulse (虚脉): Slow, large, and soft. When pressed, it vanishes, and beneath the fingers, it feels hollow and gaping.

Full pulse (实脉): Large and long, slightly strong. When pressed, it feels solid and firm beneath the fingers. Also called: *"both sinking and floating pulses are detected"* (沉浮皆得).

Forced pulse (促脉): Rapid in arrival and departure, sometimes stopping for a moment.

Knotty pulse (结脉): Slow in arrival and departure, sometimes stopping and returning again. When the pulse knots, life is generated.

Alternating pulse (代脉): Arrives in haste, then stops midway, unable to return on its own, and thus moves again. When the pulse alternates, death is near.

Scattered pulse (散脉): Large and dispersed. When scattered, *qi* is excessive and blood is deficient—there is exteriority without containment.

Leathery pulse (革脉): Resembling sinking, hidden, and full pulses, yet large and long, with a slight tautness. The *Thousand Gold Pieces Canon* (*千金翼*) calls this *"firm"* (牢).

Tautness and tension are similar. Softness and weakness are similar. Floating and knotted pulses are similar. Also, floating and bounding pulses are similar. Faintness and roughness are similar. Sinking and hidden pulses are similar. Slackness and slowness are similar. Also, softness and slowness are similar. Leathery and full pulses are similar. The *Wing* (*翼*) calls firmness and fullness similar. Slipperiness and rapidity are similar.

**The Five Zàng [Solid Organs] and Six Fǔ [Hollow Organs] Pulse Locations (第五)**

Heart pulse (心部): Located at the *cùnkǒu* [寸口, "inch opening"] on the left hand, before the *guān* [关, "barrier"]. Also named *Rényíng* [人迎, "meeting of humanity"].

Liver pulse (肝部): Located above the *guān* on the left hand.

Kidney pulse (腎部): Located behind the *guān* at the *chězhōng* [尺中, "middle of the cubit"] on the left hand.

Lung pulse (肺部): Located at the *cùnkǒu* on the right hand, before the *guān*. Also named *Qìkǒu* [气口, "mouth of breath"].

Spleen pulse (脾部): Located above the *guān* on the right hand.

Kidney pulse (腎部): Located behind the *guān* at the *chězhōng* on the right hand.

The *Pulse Canon* (*Mài Fǎ Zàn*) states:
*"Liver and Heart pulses emerge from the left,
Spleen and Lung pulses emerge from the right.
Kidney and the Gate of Life (命门) both emerge from the cubit.
Soul, spirit, and vital essence (魂魄谷神) all appear at the inch opening.
The left governs the officials (官),
The right governs the ministries (府).
The left aligns with the male principle,
The right aligns with the female principle.
One division before the guān is the master of human life.
The left is Rényíng,
The right is Qìkǒu—
The Gate of the Spirit (神门) makes the judgment,
Both located behind the guān.
Humans lack a second pulse—
When disease strikes, it does not heal,
And all the channels are diminished,
Each following its own domain.
The Three Yin and Three Yang pulses—
One may also say: 'When pressed, they reveal yin and yang.'
Who comes first, who comes after?
Yin diseases are treated within the officials (官藏),
Yang diseases are treated within the ministries (府).
Where do strange pathogens (奇邪) dwell?
Examine them carefully—
When the needle enters, the disease is cured.
The pulse has three domains,
Where yin and yang intermingle,
And the *hóngwèi* [荣卫, "nourishing and defensive"] *qi* and blood traverse the body.
With breath’s ebb and flow,
They move upward and downward within,
Following the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation,
And fluids circulate.
According to the seasons, their movements shift,
And their forms mirror their correspondences—
Spring is taut, autumn is floating,
Winter is sinking, summer is bounding."*

Examine the complexion and observe the pulse—
Great and small, they differ.
Within a single moment, their changes are without constancy.
The *cùn* and *zhǐ* vary in length,
Now short, now long,
Above and below, they diverge—
Now present, now absent.
Diseases alter swiftly,
Advancing or retreating, rising or falling.
The mind is bewildered, the will confused,
Actions stray from their proper order.
I wish to elucidate this thread by thread,
So that distinctions may be made clear.

The Master said:
"What you inquire about is the root of the Dao.
The pulse has three domains—*cùn*, *guān*, and *zhǐ*—
Where the nourishing and defensive *qi* flow,
Never deviating from their balance.
The kidneys’ pulse is deep, the heart’s bounding,
The lungs’ floating, the liver’s taut—
These are the constant patterns,
Never straying by a hair’s breadth.
Rising and falling, entering and exiting,
Like the revolving of water clocks.
When water descends two *kè*,
The pulse completes one full circuit of the body,
Then returns to the *cùn-kǒu*,
Where emptiness and fullness reveal themselves.

Changes and transformations intermingle,
Yin and yang interrelate—
Wind makes it float and empty,
Cold makes it taut and taut-as-a-string,
Deep and submerged like water’s dwelling,
*zhīyǐn* [支饮] and urgent tautness—
Movement and tautness bring pain,
Rapid and bounding bring heat and agitation.
If there are anomalies,
One knows the cause of the change.

The three domains differ,
Each disease takes its own form.
Excess is strange,
Deficiency is no less so;
Pathogens do not appear in vain,
They must harbor some deceit.
Examine the exterior and interior,
Distinguish the Three Burners,
Know where the pathogen resides,
And diagnose through its ebb and flow.
Assess the *fǔ* and *zàng*,
Perceive with divine clarity.

**Differentiating Disease Forms (Section Five):**
Pulses that are numerous belong to the *fǔ*,
Slow pulses belong to the *zàng*.
When the pulse is long and taut,
The disease lies in the liver.
*The Pulse Classic* states: "It originates from the liver."
When the pulse is small and blood is scarce,
The disease lies in the heart.
Bian Que said: "A large, bounding pulse originates from the heart."
When the pulse is firm below and empty above,
The disease lies in the spleen and stomach.
When the pulse is smooth—*or* rough—and slightly floating,
The disease lies in the lungs.
When the pulse is large and firm,
The disease lies in the kidneys.
Bian Que said: "Small and taut."
A smooth pulse indicates abundant blood and scarce *qi*.
A rough pulse indicates scarce blood and abundant *qi*.
A large pulse indicates both blood and *qi* are abundant.
It is also said: "When the pulse arrives large and firm,
Both blood and *qi* are replete."
A small pulse indicates both blood and *qi* are scarce.
It is also said: "When the pulse arrives fine and faint,
Both blood and *qi* are depleted."
Deep, fine, and smooth yet rapid indicates heat.
Slow and taut indicates cold.
*The Pulse Classic* says: "Bounding, rapid, and smooth indicates heat;
Rough, slow, deep, and fine indicates cold."
When the pulse is vigorous, smooth, and taut,
The disease is external—heat.
When the pulse is small, firm, and taut,
The disease is internal—cold.
A small, weak, and rough pulse is called a chronic illness;
A smooth, floating, and rapid pulse is called a new illness.
A floating and smooth pulse—
The person has external heat, wind striking like needles,
Retention of fluids—difficult to treat.
A deep and taut pulse—
Upper Burner has heat, lower Burner has cold;
When cold is applied, diarrhea follows immediately.
A deep and fine pulse—
Lower Burner has cold, frequent urination,
Often with cramping pain, severe diarrhea.
A floating, taut, and smooth pulse—
External heat, internal cold, unable to pass stool or urine.
A bounding, large, and urgent pulse—
The disease progresses swiftly externally,
With headache, fever, and abscesses.
A fine, small, and urgent pulse—
The disease progresses swiftly internally,
Cold forming *jūyīn* [瘕痕], accumulations, and abdominal stabbing pain.
A deep, heavy pulse that abruptly ceases at the *cùn-kǒu*—
The disease is blood in the intestines.
A deep, heavy pulse that scatters midway—
Due to cold and improper diet, forming a condition.
A pulse that advances straight but scatters and ceases midway—
The disease is *xiāokě* [消渴, diabetes]—
*Or* it is called *jìnyànchuāng* [浸淫疮, ulcerative sores].
A deep, heavy pulse that does not reach the *cùn-kǒu*,
Wandering and ceasing—
The disease lies in the muscles, *duànshī* [遁尸, cadaverous transformation].
A pulse that turns left and is deep and heavy—
*Qi* is weak, yang is in the chest.
A pulse that turns right and does not reach the *cùn-kǒu*—
There is a flesh condition within.
A pulse like beads strung together, not reaching—
Wind and cold in the large intestine, lingering and unresolved.
A pulse like beads strung together, not reaching, with soft *cùn-kǒu*—
Retained heat in the small intestine’s membrane, lingering and unresolved.
A pulse that advances straight and rebounds left and right—
The disease is in the blood vessels—*pēixuè* [胚血, blood stasis].
A pulse that recedes and rebounds left and right—
The disease is in the sinews and bones.
When the pulse is large in front and small behind,
It indicates headache and dizziness.
When the pulse is small in front and large behind,
It indicates chest fullness and shortness of breath.
When the upper has pulse but the lower lacks it,
The person will vomit—if not, they die.
When the upper lacks pulse but the lower has it,
Though exhausted, they suffer no distress.

The pulse is the repository of blood.
When long, *qi* is harmonized;
When short, *qi* is diseased.
When rapid, the mind is agitated;
When large, the disease advances.
When the upper is vigorous, *qi* is high;
When the lower is vigorous, *qi* is distended.
When it is *dài* [代, intermittent], *qi* is declining.
When fine—*or* smooth—*qi* is scarce;
When rough, the heart aches.
When it surges like a gushing spring,
The disease advances and becomes perilous.
When it is faint and slack, like a snapped string,
Death is near.
When short and urgent, the disease is above;
When long and relaxed, the disease is below.
When deep, taut, and urgent, the disease is internal;
When floating, bounding, and large, the disease is external.
A firm pulse indicates internal disease;
A hollow pulse indicates external disease.
Above is the exterior, below is the interior;
Floating is the exterior, deep is the interior.
Smooth indicates fullness and the lower body,
*Or* declining yang *qi*.
Rapid indicates emptiness and heat;
Floating indicates wind and emptiness;
Movement indicates pain and fright;
Deep indicates water and fullness,
*Or* *guǐyāo* [鬼疰, spectral affliction].
Weak indicates emptiness and palpitations.
Slow indicates cold;
Rough indicates scarce blood;
Relaxed indicates emptiness;
Bounding indicates *qi*—*or* heat.
Taut indicates cold;
Taut and rapid indicates malaria.
Malaria pulses are taut by nature;
Taut and rapid often indicate heat,
Taut and slow often indicate cold.
Faint indicates emptiness;
*Dài* [代] and scattered indicate death.
Taut indicates painful *bì* [痹, numbness]—*or* floating indicates wind conditions.
One-sided tautness indicates retention of fluids;
Bilateral tautness causes lateral rigidity and pain,
The person feels rough and dislikes cold.
A large pulse indicates heat and cold in the middle.
When latent, it becomes *huòluàn* [霍乱, acute dysentery].

**The Three Passes and Their Corresponding Treatments (Section VI)**

For **floating pulses** and **taut pulses**,
For **sinking pulses** and **taut pulses**,
For **rough pulses** and **slippery pulses**—
If found at the *cùnkǒu* [寸口, radial wrist position],
Diseases are above the diaphragm—**affecting the head**.

If found at the *guānshàng* [关上, "upper pass"],
Diseases are below the stomach—**affecting the abdomen**.

If found at the *chǐzhōng* [尺中, "middle cubit"],
Diseases are below the kidneys—**affecting the waist and legs**.

**Pulse Diagnosis at the *Cùnkǒu* [寸口, Radial Wrist Position] (Section VII)**

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **slippery and slow**,
Neither sinking nor floating,
Neither long nor short,
It indicates **no disease**—
The left and right pulses follow the same law.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **excessive or deficient**—
When the pulse at the *cùnkǒu* is short in the middle hand,
It is **headache**;
When long in the middle hand,
It is **foot joint pain**;
When hurried and striking upward,
It is **shoulder and back pain**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and firm**,
It is **disease in the middle**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **floating and bounding**,
It is **disease on the outside**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and weak**,
It is **cold and heat or hernia and *hù* [瘕, "blockage"]**—
Lower abdomen aches.
*Or* **heat**—*or* **cold**—*or* **internal disease**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and weak**,
The disease will **inevitably worsen**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and taut**,
Cold is beneath the heart—
Frequent pain, with lingering pathogenic *yí* [邪, "evil" or "harmful agents"].

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and slippery**,
There is **fluid in the chest**—
Face and eyes are swollen, with slight heat—
It is **wind-water**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking, large, and slippery**,
Sinking indicates **blood excess**,
Slippery indicates **excessive *qi***—
When blood and *qi* clash,
Entry into the **zàng* [脏, "solid organs"] means death,
Entry into the **fǔ* [腑, "hollow organs"] means recovery.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking**,
There is **shortness of breath in the chest**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **sinking and wheezing**,
It is cold and heat.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **floating and slippery**,
There is **pain in the head**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **floating and large**,
And pressing it reverses to **roughness**,
While the *chǐzhōng* [尺中, "middle cubit"] pulse is also faint and rough,
It is known there is **stagnant *qi* and undigested food**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **taut and urgent**,
Taut means **blocked *wèiqì* [卫气, "defensive *qi*"]**—
When *wèiqì* is blocked, **fear of cold** arises,
And **fluids flow through the intestines**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **taut or floating**,
Cold is above the diaphragm,
And **fluids accumulate beneath the lungs**.

If the pulse is **taut at the *cùnkǒu* [寸口] position**,
It is **apoplexy**—
Or **wind-induced headache**, as in the case of *shàngfēng* [上风, "wind attack"].
The *Yì* [翼, "Wing"] text also states it is **headache from injury by cold**.

If the pulse is **taut at the *cùnkǒu* [寸口] position**,
It is **undigested food**;
If it **descends**,
It is **headache**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **taut and large**,
In women, it causes **leukorrhea for half their lives**;
In men, it causes **blood loss and impotence**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **faint and weak**,
Faint means **fear of cold**,
Weak means **fever**—
When fever should appear but does not,
The bones ache with discomfort;
When discomfort should appear but does not,
**Extreme sweating** occurs.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **faint and weak**,
Both *qi* and blood are deficient—
In men, it causes **vomiting of blood**,
In women, it causes **menorrhagia**,
And **bile-like fluids** are vomited.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **dynamic and weak**,
Dynamic means **startled fright**,
Weak means **palpitations**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **slack and slow**,
Slack means **emptiness**,
Slow means **cold**—
When emptiness and cold *qi* clash,
One craves **warm nourishment**;
If cold food is eaten, **throat pain** ensues.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **slow and slack**,
Slow means **cold**,
Slack means **stagnant *qi***—
When cold and stagnant *qi* clash,
**Twisting pain** occurs.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **slow and choppy**,
Slow means **cold**,
Choppy means **scarce blood**.

If the pulse **reaches past the *cùnkǒu* into the *yújì* [鱼际] position**,
**Enuresis** occurs;
If the pulse **exits the *yújì* position**,
**Reverse *qi* and dyspnea** arise.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **solely firm**,
It indicates **heart overstrain**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse is **rolling like thick porridge**,
**Yang *qi* is diminished**;
If it **beats in rapid succession like spider silk**,
**Yin *qi* is declining**.

If the **forearm pulses are both absent in yang**,
One suffers **heart cold with venomous heat**,
While the **mouth feels hot**.
If one forearm pulse is **absent in yang**,
That arm **lacks mobility**;
If **both forearm pulses are absent in yang**,
The case is **untreatable**.

If the *cùnkǒu* pulse **alternates between large and small**,
It is the **yin network**—
One suffers **yin wind paralysis**,
Which **spontaneously erupts**,
And the body **feels washed by cold**.

*From the **Sun Simian’s Emergency Thousand-Gold Prescriptions, Volume 85**
*[Revised by Song-dynasty officials Lin Yi 等, including Court Attendant Lin Yi, Minister of Rites, and Secretariat Editor]*
**[Leveling the Pulse]**
**[Five Viscera Accumulations, Seventh Section]**

**Diseases of Accumulation, Concretion, and Stagnant *Qi***

Humans suffer from *accumulations*, *concretions*, and *stagnant grain-qi*. *[Note: "谷" (grain) here is also written as "系" (bind).]*

Accumulations are diseases of the *zàng* [viscera], which never shift.
Concretions are diseases of the *fǔ* [bowels], which flare at set times, their pain migrating and transforming—thus they are treatable.
Stagnant *grain-qi* manifests as lateral abdominal traction pain; pressing it eases it, but it recurs—this is *stagnant grain-qi*. When a disease has already resolved but then relapses, it is *stagnant grain-qi*.

**The Great Laws of Accumulations:**
When the pulse arrives *fine, soft, and clinging to bone*, it is an accumulation. *[#1]*
If the *cùn* [inch] pulse is *knotted*, the accumulation is in the chest.
If it *barely emerges at the cùn*, the accumulation is in the throat.
If the *guān* [bar] pulse is knotted, the accumulation is beside the navel.
If it *slightly descends past the guān*, the accumulation is in the lower abdomen.
If the *chǐ* [foot] pulse is knotted, the accumulation is at *Qìchōng* [气冲].
If it is knotted *above the guān*, the accumulation is beneath the heart.

If the pulse appears on the left, the accumulation is on the left;
If it appears on the right, the accumulation is on the right.
If the pulse appears on both sides, the accumulation is central—each corresponds to its region.

If the *cùn* pulse is *sunken and horizontal*, there is a *horizontal accumulation* in the lateral abdomen and abdomen, and the pulse is *tight*.
If there is *sudden abdominal pain* with *lumbar-back pain radiating*, there is a *cold cèng* [症] or *jǐ* [瘕] accumulation in the abdomen.
If the pulse is *tight, tense, and fine*, it is a *cèng* [症].

Cold *bì* [痹], *cèng*, *jǐ*, and *accumulations* all present with *tight, tense pulses*.
If the tightness is at the *cùn*, the accumulation is beneath the heart;
If at the *guān*, it is in the stomach’s conduit;
If at the *chǐ*, it is below the navel.
Another saying: If the *guān* pulse is *long and tight*, there is an accumulation above, below, left, or right of the navel.

**Further Pulse-Symptom Laws:**
If the left-hand pulse is horizontal, the *cèng* is on the left;
If the right-hand pulse is horizontal, the *cèng* is on the right.
If the pulse *head is large above* and *small below*, the *cèng* is above;
If the head is small above and large below, the *cèng* is below.
Another method: If the horizontal pulse appears on the left, the accumulation is on the right;
If it appears on the right, the accumulation is on the left.
If the pulse is *one-sided, surging, solid, and slippery*, it is an accumulation;
If it is *tight*, it is an accumulation, *cold bì*, or *cèng* pain.
If there is an internal accumulation but no corresponding pulse, it is difficult to treat;
If one pulse corresponds, it is easy to treat;
If none correspond, treatment is impossible.

If the left-hand pulse is large and the right small,
Upper disease is in the left lateral abdomen, lower disease in the left foot.
If the right-hand pulse is large and the left small,
Upper disease is in the right lateral abdomen, lower disease in the right foot.

If the pulse is *tight and submerged*, there is an unmovable *cèng* in the abdomen—*certain death, untreatable*.
If the pulse arrives *fine and sunken, sometimes straight*, there is a *yōng* [痈] or *zhǒng* [肿] in the body, or a *hidden beam* in the abdomen.
If the pulse arrives *sunken and empty*, it is *diarrhea*.
If it arrives *small, sunken, and solid*, there is an accumulation in the stomach—*do not purge; eating causes vomiting*.

**Yin-Yang, Exterior-Interior, and Empty-Full [Section 8]**
*Tight* is *Shǎoyáng* [少阳],
*Slack* is *Yángmíng* [阳明],
*Surging* is *Tàiyáng* [太阳]—the *three yang*.
*Fine* is *Shǎoyīn* [少阴],
*Slow* is *Juéyīn* [厥阴],
*Sunken* is *Tàiyīn* [太阴]—the *three yin*.

The pulse may be *one yin and one yang*,
*one yin and two yang*,
*one yin and three yang*;
Or *one yang and one yin*,
*one yang and two yin*,
*one yang and three yin*.

Thus, when the *cùn* pulse exhibits six qualities—are they all moving at once?
No: The *Classic* speaks thus not of six simultaneous pulses, but of *floating, sunken, long, short, slippery, and rough*.

Generally, *floating, slippery, and long* pulses are *yang*;
*Sunken, rough, and short* are *yin*.

When it says *one yin and one yang*, it means the pulse arrives *sunken yet slippery*.
*One yin and two yang*: the pulse arrives *sunken, slippery, and long*.
*One yin and three yang*: the pulse arrives *floating, slippery, and long*, occasionally sunken.

When it says *one yang and one yin*, it means the pulse arrives *floating yet rough*.
*One yang and two yin*: the pulse arrives *long yet sunken and rough*.
*One yang and three yin*: the pulse arrives *sunken, rough, and short*, occasionally floating.

Each corresponds to its channel’s location, indicating the *order or disorder* of the disease.

**When the pulse shows *yang excess and yin deficiency*, or *yin excess and yang deficiency*—what does this mean?**
If the *floating* pulse is *small* while the *sunken* pulse is *full*, it is *yin excess and yang deficiency*;
If the *sunken* pulse is *small* while the *floating* pulse is *full*, it is *yang excess and yin deficiency*.
This is the meaning of *yin-yang empty-full*.

Generally, *floating, large, rapid, dynamic, long, and slippery* pulses are *yang*;
*Sunken, rough, weak, tight, short, and fine* are *yin*.

If a *yang* disease presents with *yin* pulses, it is *contrary*—*death ensues*;
If a *yin* disease presents with *yang* pulses, it is *harmonious*—*life ensues*.

Before the *guān* is *yang*; after the *guān* is *yin*.
If *yang* pulses are *rapid*, vomiting occurs;
If *yin* pulses are *fine*, diarrhea occurs.
If *yang* pulses are *tight*, headache ensues;
If *yin* pulses are *tight*, abdominal pain ensues—*diagnose by yin-yang*.

The *chǐ* pulse is *yin*; *yin* pulses are always *sunken and slow*.
The *cùn* and *guān* are *yang*; *yang* pulses are always *floating and rapid*.

If there is *exterior* without *interior*, the *evil* lingers, causing *ghost disease*.
What is *exterior-interior*?
The *cùn* and *chǐ* are *exterior*; the *guān* is *interior*.
If both ends have pulses but the *guān* is *absent*, it is *yin exhaustion* if the *chǐ* pulse fails to reach the *guān*, or *yang exhaustion* if the *cùn* pulse fails to reach the *guān*.
*Yin exhaustion* with *yang faintness*—*death, untreatable*.

*Inhalation* is *exterior*, belonging to the *fǔ* [bowels];
*Exhalation* is *interior*, belonging to the *zàng* [viscera].
If *yang* is faint, inhalation fails;
If *yin* is faint, exhalation fails.
Insufficient breathing causes *shortness of breath in the chest*.

*Weakness* reverses at the *guān*;
*Dampness* reverses at the *pericranium*;
*Faintness* appears above;
*Roughness* reverses below.
*Faintness* means *insufficient yang*—*sticky heat, sweating*;
*Roughness* means *blood deficiency*—*convulsions and cold*.

The pulses of the *fǔ* [bowels] are *yang*, governing *heat*;
The pulses of the *zàng* [viscera] are *yin*, governing *cold*.
If *yang* is faint, *sweating* occurs;
If *yin* is floating, *diarrhea* occurs. *[Note: Some texts say "yin faint."]*
If *yang* pulses are *rapid*, *mouth ulcers* form;
If *yin* pulses are *fine*, *cold aversion* and *restlessness* ensue, with *insomnia*.
If *yang* is *constricted*, *vomiting of blood* occurs. *[Note: Some texts say "yang rapid."]*
If *yin* is *rough*, *bleeding* occurs. *[Note: Some texts say "yin rough."]*

There is no *yang*, then there is *convulsion*;
There is no *yin*, then there is *vomiting*.

When the pulse at the *cùnkǒu* [wrist] is **floating, large, and rapid**, it is called **"yang within yang"**.
The ailment brings **restlessness, fullness, fever, headache, and abdominal heat**.

When the pulse at the *cùnkǒu* is **deep and fine**, it is called **"yang within yin"**.
The ailment brings **melancholy, displeasure, aversion to voices, shortness of breath, occasional sweating, and stagnant *yin qi***—[some texts say *"stagnant and combined"*]—**and inability to lift the arms**. *[The *Cháoyuán* [Perch Spring] text reads: "arms cannot be lifted on one side."]*

When the pulse at the *chǐ* [forearm] is **deep and fine**, it is called **"yin within yin"**.
The ailment brings **aching in both sides [of the body], inability to stand long, weakened *yin qi*, lingering urine, and itching in the *yin* region**.

When the pulse at the *chǐ* is **slippery and floating-large**, it is called **"yin within yang"**.
The ailment brings **pain and fullness in the lower abdomen, inability to urinate**; when urination occurs, **pain arises in the *yin* region**, and the same applies to defecation.

When the pulse at the *chǐ* is **taut and long**, with **no presence at the *guān* [barrier]**, this is **"yin drying yang"**.
The person suffers **heaviness in both sides [of the body] and lower abdominal pain radiating to the waist**.

When the pulse at the *cùnkǒu* is **robust and large**, with **no presence in the *chǐ***, this is **"yang drying yin"**.
The person suffers **waist and back pain, *yin* injury, and cold in the leg channels**.

Now, what are the **three vacuities and three repletions**?
It is said: **There is the vacuity and repletion of the pulse, the vacuity and repletion of the disease, and the vacuity and repletion of diagnosis**.

The **vacuity and repletion of the pulse**: a pulse that comes **soft and weak** is **vacuity**; one that is **taut** is **repletion**.

The **vacuity and repletion of the disease**:
**Excretion** is **vacuity**; **retention** is **repletion**.
**Speech** is **vacuity**; **silence** is **repletion**.
**Sluggishness** is **vacuity**; **urgency** is **repletion**.

The **vacuity and repletion of diagnosis**:
**Itching** is **vacuity**; **pain** is **repletion**.
**External pain with internal ease** is **external repletion and internal vacuity**.
**Internal pain with external ease** is **internal repletion and external vacuity**.
Thus, it is called **vacuity and repletion**.

**Question:** What is meant by **vacuity and repletion**?
**Answer:** When **pathogenic *qi*** is **flourishing**, it is **repletion**; when **vital essence and *qi*** are **depleted**, it is **vacuity**.

What is **severe repletion**?
**Severe repletion** refers to **fierce heat diseases**, where **the *qi* is hot and the pulse is full**—this is called **severe repletion**.

**Pulse is strong, skin is hot, abdomen is distended, and there is no passage of urine or feces**—these are the **Five Repletions**.
**Pulse is fine, skin is cold, *qi* is scant, there is diarrhea or dysentery with incontinence, and refusal of food and drink**—these are the **Five Vacuities**.

**Chapter Nine: Determining the Timing of Illness**

How does one know if a person will fall ill from **sleeping exposed**?
It is because **there is *yin* within *yang***.

How does one know if a person will fall ill in **summer**?
It is because **all *yang* has entered *yin***.

How does one know if a person will fall ill in **spring**?
It is because **there is no liver pulse**.
If there is no **heart pulse**, illness will come in **summer**.
If there is no **lung pulse**, illness will come in **autumn**.
If there is no **kidney pulse**, illness will come in **winter**.
If there is no **spleen pulse**, illness will come in **any season**.

**Chapter Twelve: Diagnosing Contrary Seasonal Pulses**

In **spring (wood season)**, when the **liver pulse** should arrive first, followed by the **heart**, then **lungs**, then **kidneys**, this is the **proper sequential pulse of the sovereign and minister**.
By **sixth month (earth season)**, when the **spleen pulse** should arrive first but instead **does not**, and the **kidney pulse** appears instead, this is called **"kidney contrary to spleen"**—death occurs in **seventy days**.
*What is meant by "kidney contrary to spleen"?*
In **summer (fire season)**, when the **heart pulse** should arrive first, followed by the **lungs**, but instead the **kidney pulse** appears—this is also **"kidney contrary to spleen"**.
*Critical period:* **fifth and sixth months**; **avoid days Jia-Ding (丙丁)**.

If the **spleen pulse** should arrive first in spring but instead **does not**, and the **liver pulse** arrives first, this is called **"spleen contrary to liver"**—death occurs in **thirty days**.
*Critical period:* **first and second months**; **avoid days Jia-Yi (甲乙)**.

If the **liver pulse** should arrive first in spring but instead **does not**, and the **kidney pulse** arrives first, this is called **"kidney contrary to liver"**—death occurs in **three years**.
*Critical period:* **seventh and eighth months**; **avoid days Geng-Xin (庚辛)**.

If the **heart pulse** should arrive first in summer but instead **does not**, and the **kidney pulse** arrives first, this is called **"kidney contrary to heart"**—death occurs in **two years**.
*Critical period:* **sixth month**; **avoid days Wu-Ji (戊己)**.

*The discussion of lung metal’s pulse here is omitted—this is an oversight in the *Southern Pointer*. Further clarification awaits the *Separate Records on Five Phases*.*

In treating illness, observe the **patient’s appearance, spirit, and complexion**, the **strength or decline of the pulse**, and whether the **disease is new or chronic**—only then may treatment proceed.
If **appearance and spirit align**, the **complexion is lustrous**, and the **pulse follows the seasons**, the case is **easy to treat**.
If **appearance and spirit contradict**, the **complexion is dull and lifeless**, the **pulse is firm and excessive**, and the **pulse defies the seasons**, the case is **difficult to treat**.

*Pulses that defy the seasons*:
- In **spring**, encountering a **lung pulse**,
- In **summer**, encountering a **kidney pulse**,
- In **autumn**, encountering a **heart pulse**,
- In **winter**, encountering a **spleen pulse**—
If these pulses arrive as **suspended, exhausted, or choppy**, they are called **"contrary to the seasons"**.
- In **spring and summer**, if the pulse is **deep and choppy**,
- In **autumn and winter**, if the pulse is **floating and large**,
- If the disease is **hot** but the pulse is **calm**,
- If there is **diarrhea** but the pulse is **large**,
- If there is **bleeding** but the pulse is **full**,
- If the disease is **internal** but the pulse is **firm and full**,
- If the disease is **external** but the pulse is **not full**—
These are all **contrary to the seasons** and **difficult to cure**.

The pulses of the **four seasons** all take **stomach qi (Wèi qì)** as their foundation. Even if the **sequential pulses of the sovereign and minister** appear, without **stomach qi**, recovery is difficult.
*What is the stomach pulse?*
It arrives **weak yet slippery**—this is called **easy to treat**.

When the **Nourishing and Defensive *qi*** (榮衛, *róngwèi*) flow in and out, and the **channels and collaterals** (經脈, *jīngmài*) circulate freely;
With **day and night** marking **one hundred *kè* (刻)**, and the **Five Powers/Virtues** (五德, *Wǔdé*) sequentially manifesting—

If the pulse **comes twenty-five times** and **does not stop**, all five *zàng* (五臟, *Wǔzàng*) organs **receive *qi*** (氣, *qì*), and thus there is **no disease**.

If the pulse **comes forty times** and **stops once**, one *zàng* organ **lacks *qi***.

Death occurs **after two years**, when **mulberries turn red**.

If the pulse **comes ten times** and **stops once**, four *zàng* organs **lack *qi***.
Death occurs **within the year**.

If the pulse **reaches a node** (得節, *déjié*) and **does not move**, death occurs **on the day of *Qīngmíng* (清明, Clear and Bright)**.

If the pulse **comes five times** and **stops once**, all five *zàng* organs **lack *qi***.
Death occurs **after five days**.

If the pulse **comes once** and **lingers long** (久住, *jiǔzhù*), the **latent illness** (宿病, *sùbìng*) is **in the heart** (心, *xīn*).
It will be **treated in the middle** (中治, *zhōngzhì*).

If the pulse **comes twice** and **lingers long**, the illness is **in the liver** (肝, *gān*).
It will be **treated in the middle** (中治).

If the pulse **comes three times** and **lingers long**, the illness is **in the spleen** (脾, *pí*).
It will be **treated in the lower middle** (下中治, *xiàzhōngzhì*).

If the pulse **comes four times** and **lingers long**, the illness is **in the kidney** (腎, *shèn*).
It will be **treated in the mid-course** (間中治, *jiànzhōngzhì*).

If the pulse **comes five times** and **lingers long**, the illness is **in the lung** (肺, *fèi*).
It will be **treated in the middle** (中治).

For **five-pulse diseases** (五脉病, *Wǔmài bìng*), those with **weakened and emaciated constitution** (虛羸, *xūléi*) who exhibit these signs will **die**.

The reason is this: **medicine cannot cure** (药不得而治, *yào bùdé ér zhì*), and **acupuncture cannot reach** (针不得而及, *zhēn bùdé ér jí*).
**Strong individuals** (盛人, *shèngrén*) may be treated, for their **vital *qi* is complete** (氣全, *qìquán*).

**Volume 86 begins.**
**During the Song Dynasty (宋朝), the official *Lángshǒu* (奉郎), *Guard of the Grand Secretariat* (守太常少卿充秘阁校理, *shǒu Tàicháng Shàoqīng chōng Mìgé Jiàolǐ*), *Lín Yì* (林亿) and others **verified and corrected** (校正) the text.

**Pulse Diagnosis for Critical Conditions**
**Master Bian Que’s Key Decisions on Contrary and Terminal Pulses** (第十四, *Dìshísì*)

Master Bian Que said: The *qi* of a contrary or terminal pulse is like a flock of crows gathering, a single horse being driven, or the intertwining of flowing water—like a hanging stone about to fall, emerging above the sinews, concealed beneath them, wrapped in a rigid barrier, and not belonging to the **honor (荣, *róng*) and defense (卫, *wèi*)** systems. Its movements are erratic and unpredictable, like a crossbow’s trigger being drawn and released.

A pulse that appears healthy in a sick person—coming like a **leaking roof (屋漏, *wūlòu*)**, or pecking like a **sparrow’s beak (雀啄, *quèzhuó*)**—signals death.
**Leaking roof (屋漏, *wūlòu*)**: Its flow ceases and stops abruptly, then intermittently resumes without continuity.
**Sparrow’s beak (雀啄, *quèzhuó*)**: The pulse arrives in rapid, irregular bursts, stopping and then coming again in sudden surges.

The *Classic* further states: If a patient’s pulse resembles a **leaking roof (屋漏)** or **sparrow’s beak (雀啄)** after seven or eight days of illness, death is imminent.

A pulse that **rebounds the examiner’s hand like millet grains (脉弹人手如黍米也, *mài tán rén shǒu rú shǔmǐ yě*)**—
A pulse that arrives like **a striking stone (弹石, *tánshí*)**, departing like **a loosening rope (解索, *jiěsuǒ*)**—signals death.
**Striking stone (弹石)**: Sudden and forceful, like a hammer blow.
**Loosening rope (解索)**: Frequent yet chaotic, lacking any regular sequence.

A **constrained pulse (脉困)**: If a patient’s pulse moves like **a shrimp’s swimming (虾之游, *xiā zhī yóu*)**, or **a fish’s hovering (鱼之翔, *yú zhī xiáng*)**—signals death.
**Shrimp’s swimming (虾游)**: Slowly rising, then quickly retreating, vanishing without trace, lingering for a long time before reappearing—each surge sluggish, each retreat swift.
**Fish’s hovering (鱼翔)**: Appears as if the fish is not moving, yet only its tail flickers, its body scattered and lingering for long.

A pulse like **a suspended thin thread (悬薄卷索)**—signals death.
A pulse like **a rolling bean (转豆)**—signals death.
A pulse like **a reversed blade (偃刀)**—signals death.
A pulse that **surgingly refuses to depart (涌涌不去)**—signals death.
A pulse that **suddenly vanishes and reappears (忽去忽来)**, briefly stopping before returning—signals death.
A pulse that **expands within (中侈)**—signals death.
A pulse that **splits and ceases (分绝)**—signals death, for its flow is disjointed.

A pulse that **has surface presence but no depth (有表无裹)**—signals death, known in the *Classic* as **binding (结)**. If it departs, death is near.
What is **binding (结)**? A pulse beneath the fingers that trembles like a **hemp seed (麻子)**, rooted in the **kidney (肾)**, called **binding (结)**—departure brings death swiftly.

A pulse that **comes five times without further increase or decrease (五来不复增减)**—signals death, known in the *Classic* as **substitution (代)**.
What is **substitution (代)**? A pulse that arrives five times and then stops—when seven beats correspond to one breath, and it neither quickens nor slows over half a breath—this is also called **substitution (代)**, a certain sign of death.

The *Classic* states: Some illnesses may lead to death, others to incurable decline, or yet others to prolonged suffering without end. Can one determine life, death, survival, or perishing through pulse examination alone?
Indeed, one can **fully discern** it. Observe this:

If a patient **closes their eyes and refuses to see others**, their pulse should be **liver pulse (肝脉)**: taut, urgent, and long. If instead it is **lung pulse (肺脉)**: floating, short, and rough—death is imminent.

If a patient **opens their eyes and is thirsty, with a firm sensation beneath the heart**, their pulse should be **tight and solid (紧实)**, rapid. If instead it is **deep and smooth (沉滑)**, faint—death is imminent.

If a patient **vomits blood and then has nasal or gingival bleeding (鼽衄)**, their pulse should be **deep and fine (沉细)**. If instead it is **floating, large, and firm (浮大牢)**—death is imminent.

If a patient **deliriously speaks nonsense (谵言妄语)**, yet their body **should be hot**, their pulse should be **overflowing and large (洪大)**. If instead their **four limbs are in reverse (四逆)**, and their pulse is **deep, fine, and faint (沉细微)**—death is imminent.

If a patient **has a distended abdomen and diarrhea (大腹而泄)**, their pulse should be **fine and rough (微细而涩)**. If instead it is **tight, large, and smooth (紧大而滑)**—death is imminent.

This is the principle.

The *Classic* states: When a patient’s **form and pulse contradict their illness (形脉与病相反)**, what then?
Thus: If a patient **suffers headaches or eye pain**, yet their pulse is **short and rough (短涩)**—death is imminent.
If a patient **has abdominal pain**, yet their pulse is **floating, large, and long (浮大而长)**—death is imminent.
If a patient **has a full abdomen and shortness of breath (腹满而喘)**, yet their pulse is **smooth and flowing (滑利)**, deep—death is imminent.
If a patient’s **four limbs are in reverse (厥逆)**, yet their pulse is **floating, large, and short (浮大而短)**—death is imminent.
If a patient **is deaf (耳聋)**, yet their pulse is **floating, large, and rough (浮大而涩)**—death is imminent.

*The Thousand-Gold Supplement* (《千金翼》) states: A **large pulse (脉大)** indicates life; a **deep, slow, and fine pulse (沉运细)** is difficult to treat.
If a patient **has obscured vision (目□□)**, yet their pulse is **large and slack (大而缓)**—death is imminent.

If **left-sided disease causes right-sided pain**, or **right-sided disease causes left-sided pain**, or **lower disease causes upper pain**, or **upper disease causes lower pain**, this is **contrary (逆)**—contrary cases are fatal and untreatable.

A pulse that **arrives deep yet ceases to be faint (沉之绝濡)**, or **floating yet does not stop (浮之不止)**, or **pushes against the hand (推手)**—death occurs within half a month. *(Alternative reading: half a day.)*

A pulse that **arrives faint and fine yet ceases (微细而绝)**—the patient’s illness is fatal.
If the **patient’s pulse is not diseased yet they are sick**, life is possible. If the **patient’s pulse is diseased yet they appear healthy**, death is imminent.

If a patient **is in a state of deathly collapse (尸厥)**, unresponsive when called, with a **ceased pulse (脉绝)**—death is imminent.

If a pulse **should be large yet is small**—death is imminent.
If a **plump person’s (肥人)** pulse is **fine and small like a thread, about to cease (如丝欲绝)**—death is imminent.
If a **lean person (赢人)** exhibits a **frenzied pulse (躁脉)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is rough (涩)** yet the pulse **flows smoothly (来往滑)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is smooth (滑)** yet the pulse **is rough (来往涩)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is small (小)** yet the pulse **is large (来往大)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is large (大)** yet the pulse **is small (来往小)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is short (短)** yet the pulse **is long (来往长)**—death is imminent.
If a **body is long (长)** yet the pulse **is short (来往短)**—death is imminent.

If the **pulse at the wrist (尺脉)** **corresponds inversely to the pulse at the radial end (寸口)**—large and slow—death occurs within half a day.
*The Pulse Classic* (《脉经》) states: If the **pulse at the wrist (尺脉)** does not correspond to the **radial end (寸)**, and its timing is **erratic (如驰)**, death occurs within half a day.

Examine the **five zang organs (五脏)**, **six fu viscera (六腑)**, and **twelve regular pulses (十二经脉)**—all may present contradictions. If even one **contrary pulse (反逆)** appears, it is a sign of impending death.

**Key Decisions on Life and Death for a Hundred Illnesses** (第十五, *Dìshíwǔ*)

In general, when diagnosing pulses, observe the patient’s **size, stature, and temperament (大小长短及性气)**, as well as their **pulse urgency (缓急)**. If the pulse’s **speed, size, and length** align with the patient’s **form and temperament**, it is auspicious. If they contradict it, the prognosis is dire.

For **injury by cold (伤寒)** with **overwhelming heat (热盛)**, a **floating and large pulse (脉浮大)** indicates life; a **deep and small pulse (沉小)** signals death.
For **injury by cold** that has **induced sweating (得汗)**, a **deep and small pulse (沉小)** indicates life; a **floating and large pulse (浮大)** signals death.

For **warm diseases (温病)**, if within three or four days **sweating has not emerged**, a **large and rapid pulse (脉大疾)** indicates life. If the pulse is **fine and small, difficult to obtain (细小难得)**, death is inevitable and treatment futile.
For **warm diseases** with **prolonged high fever (时行大热)**, if the pulse is **fine and small**—death is imminent. *(Alternative reading: The Pulse Classic states "proliferating fever (穰穰).")*

For **warm diseases** with **diarrhea (下利)**, if **abdominal pain is severe**—death is inevitable and treatment futile.
For **warm diseases** where **sweating does not emerge**, or if it emerges **only up to the feet (不至足)**—death is imminent.

If **reverse collapse (厥逆)** occurs with **sweating**, yet the pulse is **firm, strong, and urgent (坚强急)**—life is possible.

「If the pulse is **weak and slack (虚缓)**, death is inevitable.

For **heat diseases (热病)** lasting two or three days, where the body is hot, the abdomen is full, and there is headache, but appetite and thirst remain unchanged, if the pulse is **straight and rapid (直而疾)**, death will occur within eight days.
For four or five days, if there is headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting, and the pulse arrives **fine yet strong (细强)**, death will occur within twelve days.
For eight or nine days, if there is no headache, no body pain, no redness in the eyes, no change in complexion, yet **diarrhea suddenly emerges (反利)**, and the pulse arrives **taiding-taiding (牒牒, i.e., irregularly strong)**, pressing it does not rebound under the fingers—if it is **intermittently large (时大)**, and the area beneath the heart is **firm (心下坚)**, death will occur within seventeen days.

For **heat diseases (热病)** lasting seven or eight days, if the pulse is **not soft (不软)**—*(alternative readings: if breathing is not dispersed (喘不散) or if the pulse is rapid (数))*—**hoarseness (喑)** will follow. After three days, if **sweating does not emerge (汗不出)**, death is inevitable.

For **heat diseases (热病)** where **sweating has not yet emerged**, if the pulse is **urgent and rapid (盛躁疾)**, the patient will recover if **sweating emerges (得汗)**, but if **sweating does not emerge (不得汗)**, recovery will be difficult.

For **heat diseases (热病)** where **sweating has already emerged**, if the pulse is **calm and settled (静安)**, life is possible. If the pulse is **urgent (躁)**, treatment will be difficult.

For **heat diseases (热病)** where the pulse is **urgent and strong yet sweating does not emerge (脉躁盛而不得汗)**, this is the **extreme of yang (阳之极)**, and death is inevitable—ten cases out of ten will not recover.
For **heat diseases (热病)** where **sweating has already emerged**, yet the pulse remains **constantly urgent and strong (脉常躁盛)**, this is the **extreme of yin (阴气之极)**, and death is also inevitable. *(The Classic of Great Simplicity (《太素》) reads "extreme of yang (阳极).")*

For **heat diseases (热病)** where **sweating has already emerged**, yet **fever does not subside (热不去)**, death is also inevitable. *(Alternative reading: if the pulse is **fixed and intense (专)**.)*

For **heat diseases (热病)** where **sweating has already emerged**, yet **fever remains (热未去)**, and the pulse is **slightly urgent (微躁)**, **needling or bloodletting must be approached with caution (刺治)**, and such treatment is **not advisable (慎不得).**

If **full and taut (实而紧)**, it also indicates life.
If **full, taut, and urgent (实而紧急)**, epilepsy may be treated.

If the **three pulse positions are strong (强)**, yet **unsuited to the person (非称其人)**, illness will lead to death.

If the **three pulse positions are coarse (粗)**, prolonged illness leads to death, but sudden illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are fine and soft (细而软)**, prolonged illness indicates life, while **fine and rapid (细而数)** also indicates life.
If **weak and taut (微而紧)**, it also indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are weak and submerged (微而伏)**, prolonged illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are soft (软)**, prolonged illness results in **untreatable yet self-recovering (不治自愈)**, but if treated, death is inevitable.
Sudden illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are floating and knotted (浮而结)**, prolonged illness leads to death.
If **floating and slippery (浮而滑)**, prolonged illness also leads to death.
If **floating and rapid (浮而数)**, prolonged illness from **wind (风)** indicates life, but sudden illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are rough (芤)**, prolonged illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are taut and rapid (弦而数)**, prolonged illness indicates life, but sudden illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are leathery (革)**, prolonged illness leads to death, but sudden illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are firm and rapid (坚而数)**, resembling **the stem of a silver hairpin (银钗股)**, illness from **hexian poison (蛊毒病)** is certain to lead to death.

If **rapid and soft (数而软)**, illness from **hexian poison (蛊毒病)** is certain to lead to life.

If the **three pulse positions are surging (潎潎)** like grease on the surface of porridge (潎潎如羹上肥), prolonged illness leads to death, but sudden illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are continuous (连连)** like spider silk (连连如蜘蛛丝), prolonged illness leads to death, but sudden illness indicates life.

If the **three pulse positions are like thunderclaps (如霹雳)**, prolonged illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are like a drawn bow (如角弓)**, prolonged illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are beaded (累累)** like strung pearls (如贯珠), prolonged illness leads to death.

If the **three pulse positions are like water flowing (如水淹然流)**, prolonged illness will not be treated and self-heal, but if treated, it will lead to death.

If the **three pulse positions are like a leaking roof (如屋漏)**, prolonged illness leads to death within fourteen days. The *Pulse Classic (脉经)* states ten days.

If the **three pulse positions are like a sparrow pecking (如雀啄)**, prolonged illness leads to death within seven days.

If the **three pulse positions are like boiling water in a pot (如釜中汤沸)**, obtained in the morning leads to death by evening, obtained at midnight leads to death by midday, and obtained at midday leads to death by midnight.

If the **three pulse positions are urgent and sharp (急切)**, abdominal illness with **wandering (婉转)** abdominal pain, acupuncture will cause **spreading (瘥)** above and below.

**Acupuncture and Moxibustion Treatments**
**The Three-Person Diagram of the Bright Hall**

**Fourteen Front-Facing Points | Ten Back-Facing Points | Six Side-Facing Points**

The origins of disease lie in the **zàng-fǔ (viscera and bowels)**. Their pulses emerge from the hands and feet, circulating across the abdomen and back, reaching everywhere, appearing and vanishing without measure. To locate their **acupoints (穴)**, one must rely on diagrams. To refine technique, moxibustion is indispensable.

Thus the *Classics* say:
*"Decoctions attack from within, acupuncture and moxibustion from without—then disease has nowhere to flee."*

Only then does one grasp that acupuncture and moxibustion surpass decoctions by half.

Yet, distant from the sages, students remain ignorant. The paths of **acupoints (孔穴)** are unclear, their sources lost. In desperate cases, confusion reigns. I lament their inadequacy and, in my leisure, compile this *Bright Hall Diagram* from ancient and modern masters of acupuncture and moxibustion, to supplement my own deficiencies.

Thus, by following the diagram, one may discern the **acupoints (穴)**, and by the *Classics*, their divisions—making their proximity and distance plain.

The old *Bright Hall Diagram* was long neglected, its transmissions flawed, unworthy of guidance. Now, I adhere to the newly revised version by Zhen Quan and others.

If one follows the *Bright Hall Canon*, the standard figure is **seven *chǐ* six *cùn* four *fēn*** tall. Here, halved for the diagram, the figure is **three *chǐ* eight *cùn* two *fēn***. The spacing between **acupoints (穴)** is also halved, with five *fēn* as one *cùn*. The *chǐ* follows the ancient *Xia* measure—where six *chǐ* make a *bù* (step), equivalent to the eight-*cùn* small *chǐ* used in Jiang-Huai, Wu-Yue.

The **twelve primary meridians** are marked in five colors, while the **eight extraordinary meridians** are in green.

The **Three-Person Diagram** contains **650 acupoints** in total, illustrated below for clear reference.

**Front-Facing (仰人):** 282 points
**Back-Facing (伏人):** 194 points
**Side-Facing (侧人):** 174 points
**Total named acupoints:** 349
**Single-named acupoints:** 48
**Double-named acupoints:** 301

**Discourse:**
If one were to consider the Kidney (肾), Heart (心), Liver (肝), Lung (肺), and Spleen (脾) as the Zang Organs, then the Bladder (膀胱), Small Intestine (小肠), Gallbladder (胆), Large Intestine (大肠), and Stomach (胃) would be the Fu Organs.
The Foot Minor Yin (足少阴) is the Kidney Channel (肾经), and the Foot Major Yang (足太阳) is the Bladder Channel (膀胱经).
This pattern extends downward to the Five Zang Organs, Five Fruits, and Five Vegetables—by analogy, all follow similarly.

*Waizheng* (《外台》) adds twenty-three additional entries, which were not originally part of *Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* (《千金》), and thus are not included here.

**Acupuncture Prescriptions**
**General Principles of Needling (第五, *General Principles of Needling*)**

The practitioner of needling must first understand the acupuncture points, reinforcing the deficient and reducing the excessive, directing the firm to the soft and the soft to the firm, applying urgency where needed and slowness where appropriate, ensuring the smooth flow of *honor* (荣) and *wei* (卫) qi—never deviating from principle.

The needle must never stray from the practitioner’s intent. The mouth should hold the thread as if grasping a bowstring, the eyes fixed inward, regulating *qi* and blood without erratic movement.

When the needle enters **one fen**, one perceives the *qi* of Heaven and Earth;
When it enters **two fen**, one discerns the *qi* of inhalation and exhalation—the rising and descending of Water and Fire;
When it enters **three fen**, one grasps the *qi* of the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the顺逆 *qi* of the Five Zang Organs and Six Fu Organs.

Needling the **skin and hair, pores and interstices** must not harm the muscles;
Needling the **muscles** must not harm the tendons and vessels;
Needling the **tendons and vessels** must not harm the bone marrow;
Needling the **bone marrow** must not harm the collateral vessels.

The **East (甲乙, Wood)** governs the Liver, Gallbladder, tendons, and *hun* (魂, ethereal soul).
The **South (丙丁, Fire)** governs the Heart, Small Intestine, blood vessels, and *shen* (神, spirit).
The **West (庚辛, Metal)** governs the Lung, Large Intestine, skin and hair, and *po* (魄, corporeal soul).
The **North (壬癸, Water)** governs the Kidney, Bladder, bone marrow, and *zhi* (志, will).
The **Center (戊己, Earth)** governs the Spleen, Stomach, muscles, and *yi* (意, intent).

If needling harms the **tendons**, the patient will stare blankly, losing their *hun* (魂).
If it harms the **blood vessels**, the patient will grow agitated, losing their *shen* (神).
If it harms the **skin and hair**, the patient will pant, losing their *po* (魄).
If it harms the **bone marrow**, the patient will groan, losing their *zhi* (志).
If it harms the **muscles**, the patient’s limbs will fail to contract, losing their *yi* (意).

These are the **Five Disruptions**—disturbances arising from improper needling.
If the practitioner further exceeds measure, death may follow.

Needling can kill the living but cannot revive the dead—
for the foolish who needle recklessly will die,
yet cannot restore life to the living.

Moreover, one must discern:
If a patient’s condition resembles death, do not treat them;
If a ruler’s governance resembles ruin, do not advise them.
Even the wisest sage cannot revive the dead or restore a fallen state.

Thus it is said:
*"Enter not a perilous state, dwell not in chaos."*

The foolish, greedy for gain, unaware of preservation or ruin,
risk their own lives and lineage—both perish together.
The collapse of states and families is also the way of medicine.

**Methods of Needling**
First, determine reinforcement or reduction.
The breath should align with the *Jiang* and *Han* rivers—
reinforcement and reduction must be measured like *sheng* (升) and *dou* (斗) vessels,
adhering to the prescribed methods of the classics,
ensuring *yin* and *yang* do not conflict.

*Zhen* (震, Thunder) marks the beginning of *yang* *qi*, Fire rules at *yín* (寅).
*Dui* (兑, Joy) marks the end of *yin* *qi*; *wu* (戊) is the Earth’s grave.

*Kàn* (坎, Water) is the *Tai Xuan Hua* (太玄华)—
at Winter Solstice, the night’s midpoint births the first *yang* line.
*Li* (离, Fire) is the *Tai Yang Jing* (太阳精),
symbolizing the central maiden.

To **reinforce**, needle from *mǎo* (卯, Southeast) to *nán* (南, South),
filling deficiencies—from *dìhù* (地户) to *xùn* (巽, Southeast) as *dìxū* (地虚, Earth’s emptiness).
To **reduce**, needle from *yǒu* (酉, Northwest).

*The Tianmen* (天门) lies in *qián* (乾, Heaven).
Needles are inserted by daylight, facing *yín* (寅) to *wǔ* (午).
They are removed by moonlight, from *shēn* (申) toward *wǔ* (午)—
*wǔ* being the position of the sun and moon’s light.

Thus, contemplating the Five Phases,
adjusting *honor* and *wei* *qi* to harmonize the body—
this is called the *Random Body Treasure* (随身宝).

**Methods of Using the *Fēngzhēn* (锋针, Sharp Needle)**
For swift disease removal:
First, reinforce with five breaths, then insert five *fen* and retain for ten breaths;
insert one *cùn* and retain for twenty breaths—
adjusting as the master directs.

For **urgent needling**, insert deeply and retain longer;
for **slow needling**, insert shallowly and remove swiftly;
for **large lesions**, allow slight bleeding;
for **slippery points**, remove quickly, insert shallowly, and retain longer;
for **tight points**, locate the vessel precisely, retain according to its *shùn* or *nì*, then remove swiftly—
press the point but do not bleed.

For the **weak and small**, avoid large needles.
If *qi* is deficient, supplement with herbs.

The **three other needles**—
the *zhèngzhōng* (正中), *pòyōng* (破痈), *jiānliú* (坚瘤), and *rùròu* (息肉)—
also treat diseases.

The **fire needle** also uses a sharp needle,
burned with oil flame to achieve fierce heat—
if insufficient, it harms the patient.

Apply every other day; after three sessions,
abundant pus and fluid indicate success.

*The Jiùquè* (巨阙), *Tàicāng* (太仓), and *Shàngxiàguǎn* (上下管)—
these six points in this row **forbid** fire needling.

For **large, hardened masses**, pause and rotate the needle briefly—
this is optimal.

Before each needling, examine the pulse:
if strong, proceed; if weak, do not needle hastily.

If fever and chills arise the night after needling,
this signifies the disease is struck—do not be alarmed.

---
**Moxibustion Principles (第六, *Moxibustion Principles*)**

All acupuncture points on the body are where the Zang-Fu Organs’ *honor* and *wei* *qi*, blood, and vessels circulate—
each with its designated pathways for urgent treatment.
Patients vary in age, stature, fatness, and leanness—
each requires careful consideration, measured proportionately;
do not apply uniformly, lest errors arise.

The **inch measurement** follows the ancient standard of eight *cùn* per *chǐ*,
taking the first joint of the middle finger (left for men, right for women) as one *cùn*.
If the hand’s length is indeterminate,
use the width of the thumb’s first joint as one *cùn*.

Skill lies in perception—
*"One *fú* (夫)"* refers to the span of four fingers.
Also, identify by muscle texture, creases, depressions, or the patient’s sensation of relief upon pressure—
only the meticulous will succeed.

Where the classics speak of *"three intervals"* (横三间),
this means three moxa cones between two intervals—
one *cùn* contains three moxa applications,
each moxa cone being three *fen*—
three *zhuàng* (壮) constitute one *cùn*.

The Yellow Emperor said:
*"Moxibustion without three *fen* is mere cruelty."*

The moxa cone must be large—
small or weak cones yield poor results.
Adjust according to intent.

**Methods of Moxibustion**
The patient must lie level; never tilt.
If the point is misaligned during moxibustion,
it benefits nothing—only damaging healthy flesh.

If the point is seated, then apply **moxibustion while seated**; if the point is prone, then apply **external moxibustion**; if the point is upright, then apply **moxibustion while standing**—to do otherwise risks missing the target.

When speaking of *zhuàng* (壮) counts,
if a robust adult encounters a deep-rooted illness,
one may **double the usual number**.
For the elderly, weak, or infirm,
one may **reduce it by half**.
According to Bian Que’s method,
some cases require up to **five hundred *zhuàng*** or **a thousand *zhuàng***—
each case must be adjusted as needed;
do not rigidly adhere to fixed rules.

The *Míngtáng* (明堂) classics often state:
*"Needle insertion to six *fēn* (分),
moxibustion to three *zhuàng*."*
No further instruction is given.

Cao’s method includes **a hundred *zhuàng*** or **fifty *zhuàng***,
and the *Xiǎopǐn* (小品) prescriptions also follow this.
Adjustments must be made based on the severity of the illness—
**do not blindly follow tradition**.

For infants over **seven days old** and up to **one year old**,
moxibustion should not exceed **seven *zhuàng***,
with cones no larger than **a sparrow’s droppings**.

In general, **moxibustion proceeds from yang to yin**—
begin at the **head, moving leftward downward**,
then proceed from the **head, moving rightward downward**.
Always **start from the upper body and move downward**,
and perform moxibustion **only after noon**,
when **yin-qi has not yet ascended**.
Needling or moxibustion before dawn,
when **the stomach-qi is weak and the body prone to dizziness**,
is forbidden—**beware**.

Such are the **primary principles**,
but **sudden acute cases** must not be treated by these fixed rules.

**Moxibustion techniques for raw or cooked effects**:
The **waist and above** constitute the **upper region**,
the **waist and below** the **lower region**.
The **external** is **yang**, nourishing the **honors** (荣),
the **internal** is **yin**, safeguarding the **defenses** (卫).
Thus, the **zàng-fǔ** (脏腑) and their **circulatory pathways** (经络)
are named so.

Hence, **men aged forty and above** have their **qi in the waist**,
while **women aged forty and above** have their **qi in the breasts**.
Thus, **men decline from below first**,
and **women decline from above first**.
When applying **raw or cooked moxibustion**,
one must **moderate and adjust accordingly**—
the method should **follow the shifting nature of the disease**.
The **general rule** is:
**External moxibustion should prioritize raw effects**,
**internal moxibustion should prioritize cooked effects**;
the rest may be adjusted as needed.

The **head** is the **source of the body**,
where **the spirit and *Dao* (神之所法) reside**.
Its **orifices** (气口) are sharp and clear,
and **the three hundred and sixty-five pathways** (络)
all converge upward at the head.
Thus, the **head is the gathering point of all yang**—
**head diseases must be carefully examined**,
and **moxibustion of its points must not be reckless**.
Overuse risks **injuring the spirit**,
or **exhausting yang-essence** (阳精),
causing **yin-spirit** (阴魄) to **rebel in turn**—
hence, **moxibustion of the head should not exceed a hundred *zhuàng***.

The **back and spine** serve as the **body’s transverse beam**,
where **the five *zàng* (脏) are struck or settled**,
and the **Taiyang meridian** (太阳) converges.
Here, **yin and yang disturbances** manifest,
and **cold or heat** become ailments.
**Excessive cooked moxibustion** harms the patient greatly.

The **arms and legs, hands and feet** are the **body’s branches**,
where **the spirit strikes into the five *zàng* and six *fǔ* (腑)**.
They **draw nourishment from blood and vessels** (脉),
**adapt to distant or near needs**,
**venture into deep or shallow terrain**,
and **sustain the meridians**.
Their **positions are narrow and shallow**—
thus, **moxibustion should be minimal**.
**Overuse** prevents **internal spirit** (内神) from entering,
**clogging the spirit’s flow**,
leading to **numbness and paralysis**—
**the arm may fail to lift**.
Hence, **moxibustion of the limbs should not be overcooked**.

Yet, **the internal organs** (腹脏) are of **essential nature**—
**indulging in the five flavors** (五味) without restraint
can **fester into chronic wind-cold**,
**impairing digestion** (水谷不消).
Thus, **cooked moxibustion is appropriate**.

For **Dàzhù (大杼), Jǐngzhōng (脊中), Shènshū (肾输), and Pángguāng (膀胱)**—
**eight critical points**—
up to **two hundred *zhuàng*** may be applied.

For **Xīnzhǔ (心主)** and **hand-foot *Tàiyīn* (太阴)**,
up to **sixty or seventy *zhuàng*** may be applied.

For **Sānlǐ (三里), Tàixī (太溪), Tàichōng (太冲)**,
and **the two *Yīnyáng Língquán* (阴阳陵泉)**,
and **the upper and lower *Lián* (廉)**,
up to **a hundred *zhuàng*** may be applied—
**three sessions** (三报) are required for full recovery.

For **Fùshàng (腹上), Xiàguǎn (下管), Zhōngguǎn (中管), Tàicāng (太仓), and Guānyuán (关元)**,
up to **a hundred *zhuàng*** may be applied—
**three sessions** are required for full recovery.

If the illness is severe,
**three sessions** are essential for healing.

For **deep-rooted cold and stagnant diseases**,
**cooked moxibustion is most effective**.

If treating **wind disorders of yin and yang** (阴阳风),
where the **body is hot and pulses are large**,
use **a sharp needle** (锋针) to **pierce the point**,
and **reinforce every other day**—
**one session** (一报) as before.

If treating **evil wind or spectral possession** (邪风鬼注),
where **pain is acute and *qi* is weak**,
use **a fine needle** (毫针) to **dispel the affliction**,
adjusting based on the **severity of the disease**.

**Superficial needling and internal medicine** must be applied as needed,
**adjusting and guiding the *qi***,
**harmonizing with the heavens** (与天同心).
With such care, **a hundred years of lasting peace** (永安)
and **no sudden illnesses** (横病) will follow.
This is the **essential summary**—
**do not pass it on unless wise**; keep it secret.

**For faint or subtle pulses** (微数之脉),
**moxibustion is strictly forbidden**—
it risks **injuring blood and vessels**,
and **scorching sinews and bones**.

**After sweating, do not apply moxibustion**—
this is **a grave violation**.

If the **pulse is floating and heat is intense**,
**moxibustion is forbidden**.

For **head, face, eyes, and throat**,
**raw moxibustion with minimal effect** is preferred;
for **arms and legs**,
**slightly cooked moxibustion** is advised—
**never apply excessively**.

For **chest, back, and abdomen**,
**strongly cooked moxibustion** is most suitable;
for the **waist and spine**,
**raw moxibustion with minimal effect** is preferred.

In all cases, **adjust according to intent**,
**modify as circumstances demand**,
**respond flexibly to a thousand changes and ten thousand variations**—
**no single rule can encompass all possibilities**.

For **warm diseases** (温病),
apply moxibustion **where the symptoms manifest**—
up to **a hundred *zhuàng* or more**,
or as few as **ninety *zhuàng***.

For **Dàzhù (大杼) and the stomach’s *guǎn* (胃管)**,
up to **fifty *zhuàng*** may be applied.

For **Xīnzhǔ (心主) and hand-foot *Tàiyáng* (太阳)**,
up to **fifty *zhuàng*** may be applied.

For **Sānlǐ (三里), Qūchí (曲池), and Tàichōng (太冲)**,
up to **a hundred *zhuàng*** may be applied—
**three sessions** are required for full recovery.

If **five *láo* (劳) ailments** (五劳) are **deep-seated and widespread**,
or if **poisonous *qi* (毒气) is the cause**,
**no more than fifty *zhuàng*** should be applied—
**three sessions** are required for full recovery.

If **attacking the *zàng-fǔ* (脏腑) causes abdominal pain**,
up to **a hundred *zhuàng*** may be applied.

For **sudden violent illnesses** (卒暴病),
or **spectral possession**,
**moxibustion of the head, face, and limbs should be frequent**,
while **abdomen and back should be minimal**—
**never exceed fifty *zhuàng***,
and **never reduce below three, five, seven, or nine *zhuàng***.

For **yin-yang damp-wind disorders** (阴阳濡风),
or **obstructed speech** (口啁僻),
**no more than thirty *zhuàng*** should be applied,
with **one session every three days**—
**three sessions** for mild cases,
**nine sessions** for severe cases.
This is because **damp-wind *qi* is subtle and penetrates deeply**—
**gentle heat and gradual *qi* guidance** are needed to **expel it slowly**.

If **urgent treatment is forced**,
the **damp-wind *qi* will spread and penetrate deeply**,
**becoming a chronic illness**—
**incurable**.

「Hence, one should use **gentle heat** (缓火).

For **all vacuity-related illnesses** (虚疾), where **phlegm and dampness** (水谷) congeal and stagnate, causing **wandering pain** (流离), **moxibustion of the abdomen and back** (灸腹背) should be applied **frequently** (宜多), but **never exceed one hundred *zhuàng*** (不过百壮).

In general, when a person **suddenly contracts wind** (卒暴得风) or is **struck by seasonal *qi*** (中时气), and suffers from **any affliction** (凡百所苦), **urgent moxibustion or acupuncture treatment** (急灸疗) must be administered—**never endure it and allow stagnation** (慎勿忍之停滞).

If it is a **minor official** (王相), he may recover without further issue (可得无他); otherwise, if delayed, **all such cases become difficult to cure** (皆难愈).

This principle **must be deeply understood** (深宜知此一条).

For those who **travel or reside in the Sichuan or Yunnan regions** (昊蜀地游宦), **moxibustion should be applied to three or four locations on the body** (体上常须三两处灸之), ensuring **the sores do not heal prematurely** (勿令疮暂瘥). Then, **malarial miasma** (瘴疠), **warm malaria** (温疟), and **toxic *qi*** (毒气) will **not afflict the person** (不能着人).

Thus, **moxibustion is widely practiced in Sichuan and Yunnan** (故昊蜀多行灸法).

There is the **Ahshi method** (阿是法): When a person has **disease or pain** (病痛), one should **press and knead the affected area** (即令捏其上). If **a moxa roll is wrapped directly over the spot** (若裹当其处), regardless of whether it aligns with **acupuncture points** (孔穴), the pain will **immediately ease** (即得便快). The site where the pain **is resolved** (成痛处) is called the **Ahshi point** (阿是). Both **moxibustion and acupuncture** (灸刺) prove effective here, hence the term **Ahshi point** (阿是穴).

The **Seventh Chapter on the Precautions of Medical Acupuncture and Moxibustion** (太医针灸宜忌第七) states:

*"Before performing acupuncture or moxibustion, one must first determine the **auspicious and inauspicious years** (行年宜忌) and the **location of the patient’s spirit** (人神所在). If the treatment does not correspond with these **precautions** (禁忌), it may proceed—though the full guidelines follow below."*

**Auspicious years for treatment (天医):**
**Wood-element years** (木命人行年) – **inauspicious for acupuncture or ingesting green medicines** (则不宜针及服青药).
**Fire-element years** (火命人行年) – **inauspicious for inducing sweating or ingesting red medicines** (则不宜汗及服赤药).
**Earth-element years** (土命人行年) – **inauspicious for inducing vomiting or ingesting yellow medicines** (则不宜吐及服黄药).
**Metal-element years** (金命人行年) – **inauspicious for moxibustion or ingesting white medicines** (则不宜灸及服白药).
**Water-element years** (水命人行年) – **inauspicious for purgation or ingesting black medicines** (则不宜下及服黑药).

If a physician **does not know these principles** (不知此法), his treatment will **become obstructed** (下手即困); if he encounters a patient whose **year, month, or day aligns with deep inauspiciousness** (年命厄会深), his treatment may **prove fatal** (下手即死).

**Correspondences between Heavenly Doctors (天医), Blood Taboos (血忌), and Month/Year/Time Taboos (月忌, 行年医法):**

**Monthly Auspicious Times (月傍通) and Heavenly Doctors (天医):**
卯　寅　丑　子　亥　戌　酉　申　未　巳　午　辰 – **auspicious for calling a master to treat illness** (呼师治病吉)
**Blood Taboos (血忌):**
丑　未　寅　申　卯　酉　辰　戌　巳　亥　午　子 – **inauspicious for acupuncture or moxibustion** (忌针灸)
**Monthly Inauspicious Times (月厌):**
戌　酉　申　未　午　巳　辰　卯　寅　丑　子　亥 – **inauspicious for acupuncture or moxibustion** (忌针灸)
**Four Excitations (四激):**
戌　戌　戌　丑　丑　丑　辰　辰　辰　未　未　未 – **inauspicious for acupuncture or moxibustion** (忌针灸)
**Monthly Killing Times (月杀):**
戌　巳　午　未　寅　卯　辰　亥　子　丑　申　酉 – **all actions are ominous; nothing may be undertaken** (不可举，百事凶).
According to *The Thousand Gold Prescriptions* (《千金翼》) and *The External Canon* (《外台》), these are the **Monthly Killing Times** (月杀): 丑　戌　未　辰 (repeated three times).
**Monthly Punishments (月刑):**
巳　子　辰　申　午　丑　寅　酉　未　亥　卯　戌 – **inauspicious for treating disease** (不疗病)
**Six Harmful Times (六害):**
巳　辰　卯　寅　丑　子　亥　戌　酉　申　未　午 – **inauspicious for treating disease** (不疗病)

If the **auspicious monthly times** (天医) are applied, **calling a master to treat illness is fortunate** (呼师避病吉); if the **punitive or harmful times** (刑害) are applied, **the treatment is ominous** (上凶).

**Determining Auspicious Years (行年医法):**

**Method to Seek the Heavenly Doctor of the Year:**
*"Normally, add the **transmitting year** (传送) to the **Grand Duke Year** (太岁), and the **Grand Duke Year’s position** (太乙下) is the Heavenly Doctor."*

**Method to Seek the Heavenly Doctor of the Month:**
*"For **yang months** (阳月), add **Great Auspiciousness** (大吉); for **yin months** (阴月), add **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) to the **monthly stem-branch** (月建). The **Functionary’s position** (功曹下) is the **Ghostly Path** (鬼道), and the **transmitting year’s position** (传送下) is the Heavenly Doctor."*

**Method to Avoid Illness (避病法):**
*"Add **Small Auspiciousness** (小吉) to the **monthly stem-branch** (月建). The **Heavenly Doctor’s position** (登明下) is the Heavenly Doctor—**this is where one may avoid illness** (可於此避病)."*

**Method to Treat Illness (治病法):**
*"Add the **monthly stem-branch** (月将) to the **hourly stem-branch** (时), and the **Heavenly Doctor’s position** (天医) to the **patient’s year** (加病人年)—**this is where one may treat malaria** (治之疟)."*

**Method to Call a Master (唤师法):**
*"In the hours of **未、卯、巳、亥、酉**, the **spirit resides elsewhere** (鬼所在)—**calling a master here is inauspicious** (唤师凶)."*

**Needle and Moxibustion Acupuncture Points Treatise**
**The Principle of Corresponding Acupuncture Points**
**The Treatise states:** *(Whenever it is said that an acupuncture point corresponds to a disease, the point’s name is listed above, and the symptoms below. Sometimes a single ailment involves dozens of points, or several ailments share one point—all must be considered and applied flexibly as needed in practice. If a point requires needling, then needle it to reinforce or reduce; if needling is contraindicated, simply apply moxibustion. However, the fundamental method of moxibustion is this: as long as the acupuncture point and the needle pose no restrictions, once the needling—whether with a white needle or a warm needle—is complete, then apply moxibustion. This is the mark of a skilled physician. For the disease of leg qi (脚氣), needling is particularly effective. If one needles but does not moxibustion, or moxibustions but does not needle, this is not the practice of a skilled physician. If one uses needle and moxibustion without medicine, or medicine without needle and moxibustion, this is even more far from the practice of a skilled physician. It is only lamentable that in the lower strata of society, those who know needling are few. Therefore, students must deeply understand the proper application of needle therapy, mastering both warm needling (燔针) and white needling (白针). To know needling and medicine alike is indeed the way of a skilled physician.)*

**Method for Selecting the Point (取穴法):**
Have the patient sit upright, bend their spine, and extend both hands, placing the arms on the knees. Ensure the back is straight, and the large toe of the hand aligns with the kneecap. Use an object to support the elbow, preventing the arm from shaking. From the upper angle of the scapula, feel along until reaching the lower head of the scapula. Between them lies the space of four ribs and three intervals. Moxibustion should be applied to the midpoint, following the hollow between the ribs and the scapular border. Press the lateral side of the ribs, near the scapula, until the patient feels a drawing sensation toward the **chōng** (胸) **hù** (户). Moxibustion should be applied to both scapulae, each for one point, up to six hundred sessions, or even a thousand. The patient should feel **qì** descending with a rumbling sensation like flowing water; something should also be expelled. If there is no lingering **tán** (痰) or old illness, then nothing will be expelled [灸两胛中各一处，至六百壮，多至千壮，当觉气下砻砻然如流水状，亦当有所下出，若无停痰宿疾，则无所下也].

「If the patient is already too weak to sit upright, they should be made to lie on their side, with the upper arm pulled forward to locate and moxibustion the point. To find the point, use the right hand to press from the right shoulder, extending outward until the fingertips reach what the shoulder cannot; the same applies to the left hand. Then, apply moxibustion as before.

If the patient cannot maintain a prolonged upright sitting position with arms extended, they may instead lie face down with a cloth covering the upper back, arms extended forward. Have someone pull apart the scapulae to expose the point, for if not done so, the overlapping scapular point cannot be accessed. The covering cloth must be consistently adjusted to the proper size, otherwise the point will be lost.

Once this moxibustion is completed, the patient’s **yáng qì** (陽氣) should flourish. They should then regulate their breathing and practice self-nourishment, restoring their body to balance. The point is located near the fifth vertebra, viewed from above.

The text states: In ancient times, Qin Huan failed to cure Jin Hou’s illness because the affliction lay above the **gāo** (膏) and below the **huāng** (肓), beyond the reach of acupuncture and medicine—this is precisely the point in question. At that time, people lacked the skill to locate it, which is why chronic illnesses were difficult to dispel. If one applies diligence and finds this point to perform moxibustion, no illness will fail to heal.

**Sān Lǐ** (三里), also known as **Zhōngwǎn** (中腕), governs abdominal cold, distension, intestinal rumbling, abdominal pain, stagnant blood in the chest and abdomen, lower abdominal distension, skin swelling, insufficient **yīn qì** (陰氣), hardness of the lower abdomen, feverish illness with inability to sweat, frequent vomiting, bitter taste, intense heat, body inversion, clenched jaw with bulging neck, lumbar pain preventing turning of the head, dizziness upon turning, alternating joy and sorrow, and its location is sought above and below.
