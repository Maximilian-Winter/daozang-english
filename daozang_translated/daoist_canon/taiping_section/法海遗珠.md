**Precious Gems from the Dharma Ocean, Scroll 1, Part 1**
**The Divine Empyrean Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**

### **Arcane Refinement in Hidden Practice**
For those who wish to receive and uphold the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* and engage in the work of arcane refinement, perform the following at the four cardinal hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*: face the *xun* direction, sit cross-legged, knock the teeth to gather the spirit, and recite the sacred title nine times. Envision the Divine Empyrean drawing in a breath of azure *qi*, press the tongue against the upper palate, and inscribe the scripture. Hold the jade-green essence within the mouth, swallow it into the heart, and circulate it without dissipation. After a long while, it will surge upward, piercing the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace), and emerge as a sphere of *qi*. Continuously recite the sacred title until suddenly, with a thunderous crack, a spark of fire bursts forth from the sphere, merging with the radiance of the azure *qi*. At that moment, perform the rites of reverence and invocation. The spark of fire will instantly transform into celestial fire and azure light, descending straight from the *Niwan* through the *Chonglou* (Double Storied Tower) to the *Dantian* (Cinnabar Field), where it takes seat within the *Danyuan* (Elixir Origin). The deities of the Three Passes and Eight Scenic Realms will all come to pay homage, chanting the celestial scripture in unison. In an instant, all sounds vanish into silence. Practicing this morning and evening for nine years will dissolve the corpse’s toxins, refine both form and spirit to perfection, and unite one with the True Dao.

### **Secret Applications of Inscribing the Scripture**
For the talismanic script of the *Celestial Scripture*, burn incense, sit in stillness, and recite the *Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters* without counting the repetitions. Inscribe these ten characters as a talisman, either in sequence or layered. Upon completion, summon *Zhang Shu*, the Swift Commanding Numinous Flying Divine Talisman Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial Realm. Envision the talisman envoy as a Heavenly Soldier (*Tianding*) wearing a crown, with a blue-green face, golden armor, black robes, green boots, and a wind-swept sash, wielding a jade axe. He descends from the *xun* gate, merging with the ancestral *qi*. Silently pray with utmost sincerity for your intended purpose—whether for supplication, exorcism, ingestion, display, wearing, or consecration. Employ it as you wish, and it will respond without fail.

### **The Scripture of the Ten Celestial Characters**
*Summoning the Talisman Envoy Talisman*

The humble servant [Name] respectfully summons—
Having recited the Celestial Scripture above and inscribed the talisman, envision golden light entering the talisman. When invoking it for service, there is nothing it cannot penetrate.

**The Jade Pivot Scripture, Fifteen Talismans**
For each of the fifteen talismans, one must purify the heart, sit in silence, clench the fists, concentrate the spirit, and recite the Heavenly Worthy’s sagely name without counting the repetitions. Envision the Heavenly Worthy descending from the *xun* gate, and with utmost reverence, silently pray for your purpose. Visualize golden light entering the talisman, then recite the corresponding prayer for your request.

*Black of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Primordial, the True Form is revered Fire.
The thunder’s roar opens the primordial kalpa, the lightning’s flash illuminates the hidden depths.
Divine transformations manifest in wondrous ways, sagely virtue crowns all numinous beings.
How marvelous are these ten characters—worth more than reciting ten thousand scrolls of scripture.*

**Primordial Jade Pivot Mixed Thunder Chapter for Internal Refinement**

When all is settled and stabilized, self and other are forgotten. Visualize the Primordial Beginning expounding the Thunder Chapter within the Golden Portal, each character radiant with golden light. Then, envision each character filling the vastness of the Great Void, all transforming into golden script, shimmering with luminous brilliance. Next, recite the Thunder Chapter, and Marshal Xin will instantly manifest.

**Uniting Qi and Refining Spirit**
Compose the spirit and sit in stillness, where heaven and earth dissolve into emptiness. Press the tongue against the upper palate, wait until the Flower Pool’s waters fill, then swallow them into the heart—do this three times. Next, visualize within the black clouds of the northwest a deity resembling a Persian. Draw in *qi* through the nose into the heart, from the heart descend to the kidneys, then from the kidneys return to the heart—repeat this three times, and it is sufficient. Envision this *qi* entering the Cinnabar Field, which is the center of the navel. When fully coalesced into form, it becomes distinctly manifest within one’s Cinnabar Field. Then exhale with a *he* breath, releasing it from the altar to employ as desired. For regular seated refinement, settle into stillness for a time, where self and objects are forgotten, and *qi* circulates within the compass of the One.

**Oath Chapter**
Heaven unites with my true self, Earth unites with my true self,
Sun and Moon unite with my true self, the Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my true self.
My spirit enters the master’s spirit, the master’s spirit enters my spirit.
Circulating throughout the Three Realms, I act on the master’s behalf to deliver the myriad spirits.
Upon completion of the merit, I ascend to the Jade Register, awaiting the master’s return to the Purple Court.
*As the Primordial Decree commands.*

Once the incantation is complete, make any prayer as desired. After the prayer, bow once to Lord Xin, merging into one body. Sit upright in perfect stillness, where my body is Lord Xin, and Lord Xin is my body—thus summoning the Thunder Spirits. For refinement practices, enter the Central Palace. Both internal and external practices require eighty-one days each. Cultivate and nourish for three cycles of nine, and thereafter, great responses will be attained in all undertakings.

**Nine Yangs Internal Refinement Thunder Chapter**
Sweep away all worldly concerns, sit in stillness for a long while, then gather and concentrate the Five Agents. When the Five Agents harmonize, spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* all converge in the Central Palace. Golden light blazes forth, and within it stands Lord Xin. Still the heart and spirit further, descending into the Yellow Chamber, where Lord Liu appears. Next, silently recite the four characters *Nine Woods, Surplus Jade* nine times. Circulate them upward to the Mud Pill Palace, where the practitioner stands between heaven and earth. Then recite the Oath Thunder Chapter:

Before heaven and earth divided, before yin and yang were distinguished,
I existed in this moment, without head or face.
Since I have become myself, the Five Agents are all complete.
You, at this moment, are my spirit.
I am united with you, and you are born from me.
I now command you: be like me, be like me.

Then silently recite the following incantation: *Cǔn Dì Bù Lín*, eighty-one times, ascending together with me to pay homage in the Jade Clarity. You are the essence of heaven, I am the spirit of earth. Take your essence to assist my spirit. I strike the celestial drum, sounding the Dharma drum thirty-six times, causing the seas and rivers to overturn. From now on, you and I shall be as brothers forever. I dispatch you to heaven to present memorials to the Imperial Lord. I dispatch you to earth to reach the deepest springs. I dispatch you into water to pervade the dark and frigid depths. I dispatch you to relieve great droughts, where true *qi* commands thunder and lightning. I dispatch you to capture specters and demons, binding them to reveal their forms. Universally deliver the world’s suffering, and together we shall establish merit. On the day when merit is complete and the Way fulfilled, I shall ascend with you in flight.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Highest Lord of the Mysterious Heavens decree and command.*

Next, sit in stillness and visualize a mass of golden light containing seed-characters, eternally guarding the Yellow Court. In all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, silently maintain this protection. Even amidst worldly affairs and duties, one must remain vigilant. When engaging in practice, bow to the Great Void, and the spirit will follow the intent to emerge.

Shatter and destroy all ghostly encampments.

Let true qi animate the thunderclaps.
Now I stand within the altar,
Awaiting your swift return.
Do not neglect the smallest detail,
Nor betray the sacred covenant.

At midnight, sit in profound stillness, enter great samādhi, and silently recite the petition to submit. When the stars of your own celestial realm manifest, then you may silently present your memorial to the Three Clarities’ August Thearchs. Once the memorial is granted and a response received—whether seeing dragon-rain, crimson radiance, a descending sword, or golden characters within a proclamation—you may proceed with spontaneous adaptation, examining the signs in detail.

Thereafter, bow and divide to return to the Pass. Within the Pass’s Gallbladder Palace, the True Sovereign of Thunder’s Divine Empyrean appears. Report the matter and await the granted memorial; the generals are dispatched in full.

Send the Lunar General to present himself before the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, to retrieve the spirits under his charge and report: on such-and-such a day and hour of the current month, the rain shall be executed—ensure the response is distinct.

When inscribing talismans and sitting in stillness, observe the altar’s conditions closely, and guard it vigilantly. Only when the dragon-general has reported may you ascend the altar. Proceed with confidence to command the rain.

By decree, summon the Three-Five Generals to descend swiftly.
The Three Divine Kings—Liu, Lü, and Zhang—hasten to this minister’s aid, bearing the talisman to execute the command.

Three-Five Shaoyang Thunder: one talisman to the master, one talisman into the memorial text. Use two talismans for daily rotation; if unresponsive, use the urgent memorial talisman. If still ineffective, the refinement has failed, and the pledge may also be inscribed on incense and burned in the censer.

First, Xing; second, Deng; third, Liu—[for] rain. Six revolutions of the Primordial Right, drawing *qi* from the Kidney Mystery and blowing it in. [For] clear skies, five revolutions, drawing *qi* from the Heart and exhaling it in, applying it within the thunder. *Xia Xuan*: Two, two—Yin-Yang Dipper application seals the cover.

Summon the Five Divine Lords of the Jade Treasury:
Liu, Yu, Ren, Lü, and Zhang—the Five Divine Masters—hasten to this minister’s aid, bearing the talisman to heed the summons.

*Tian-Yuan* Talisman for Summoning Thunder:
Inscribed on yellow paper in cinnabar, with nine revolutions of application. The Lords of the Three *Qi* of Yuanshi; the Jade Emperor of the Golden Watchtower; the Vermilion Numinosity Lord of the Southern Culmen. By decree, summon the Nine Yang Elders to descend swiftly. The Origin of Myriad Methods—Liu, Ning, and Ren—the Three Divine Kings—bear the talisman to hasten here. This minister receives the talisman to heed the summons.

Refining and uniting the Inner Mystery:
Wind and thunder shake the earthly gates. Mysterious *qi* converges at *Li* and *Wu*. The master gathers spirit in profound stillness, closes the eyes, draws in the divine radiance, and inwardly gazes upon the Mysterious Palace. To the left and right, the two kidneys—*qi* splits open, ascending to the Crimson Palace, reaching the Divine Treasury to envelop the red and black *qi*. They intertwine within the heart, merging with the spirit-*qi*, where water and fire unite—this is called "taking the general." The center of *Kan* is filled, transforming the Yin within *Li*’s chamber.

Ascending to the Flourishing Valley Palace, dragon and tiger form a sphere. The left liver, blue *qi* harboring the *hun*—this is the dragon. The right lung, white *qi* harboring the *po*—this is the tiger. Spirit and mysterious *qi* blend and merge. Within the heart’s chamber, a purple-golden sphere coalesces. With spirit and mysterious *qi* intermingling, blue, white, red, and black gather in the central chamber. By intent, the four *qi* fuse into a golden luminous sphere. Intent belongs to earth, yellow in hue—this is the meaning of essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent transforming into purple-golden frost.

Visualize the purple-golden sphere descending to the Cinnabar Field, then entering the Tailbone Gate. From the spine’s passage, it ascends to the Muddy Pellet, flowing back down through the Twelve-Storied Tower to the Central Palace. Using the ancestral *qi*, guide it upward to surge through the Muddy Pellet, bursting forth from the crown’s gate. The golden sphere splits open, filling heaven and earth. Within, the infant gradually grows, appearing as a Daoist in yellow robes—this is the True Person of Primordial Destiny. The eyes flash open, gazing upward; the tongue presses against the upper palate, connecting directly to the void. Within, the Southern Dipper stands, its *Xun* gate open.

Behold the master standing within the mouth of the Southern Dipper, clad in black robes, hair unbound, barefoot, grasping a sword. Within the Dipper’s mouth, he stands resolute beneath the sword’s point. Observe the radiant hair-like light above the crown’s gate, where the Mother of Myriad Spirits resides, barefoot, her eyes glancing downward at two intersecting beams of fire. To the left, Marshals Deng and Liu; to the right, Marshals Zhang, Ning, and Ren.

With a single movement of divine radiance, ten thousand billion thunder spirits array themselves in orderly ranks, each distinct and clear. Visualize your Primordial Destiny True Person approaching the master’s heart and bowing three times to present your petition. The disciple prays:

*"By long-standing affinity, I have been fortunate to inherit this teaching. Humbly, I beseech your compassion, Master, to grant my request. May you bestow your decree, commanding the Three Great Marshals—Liu, Ning, and Ren—to aid and uphold my practice. I, so-and-so, dare not offend your solemn authority; my heart is filled with boundless gratitude, awaiting your command."*

If praying for rain or petitioning for some matter, visualize the master granting your plea.

Conclude with the heart’s incantation:

*"Heaven unites with my truth,
Earth unites with my truth,
Sun and moon unite with my truth.
The Three Terraces crown my head,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations unite with my truth.
My spirit enters the master’s spirit,
The master’s spirit enters my spirit.
I traverse the Three Realms,
Acting on the master’s behalf to save the myriad spirits.
When the work is done, I ascend the Jade Register,
Attending the master to return to the Purple Court.
Hūng śrī tī tā ā chāo mó suō shā."*

After the incantation, or when the heart’s petition is complete, restore your spirit.

If summoning the thunder spirits, proceed here with the recitation:

**Thunder Rites Chapter**
Chaos without form, the One *qi* gives birth.
Heaven and earth unfold, thunder and lightning move.
Tā yō Great Brahmā, hūng jì lǜ hēng.
Yin and yang intersect, sun and moon hasten in reverence.
Jū nú shí nà, zhì hè jū zhēn.
Breathing forth hūng chà, jī bō xiáng jīng.
Encompassing harmony, wind and fire surge hūng.
Zhōng yìng shù lǎng, wú liàng lǎng hūng.
Above harmonizes with below, mountains, seas, and rivers are at peace.
True crow is solemn, true decree commands homage.
Recite once, and thunder and lightning descend.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Edict of the Lord of Thunder from the Cavernous Mystery commands!*

The above is the method for gathering and stationing clouds, the secret for summoning thunder and rain.

**Further Internal Refinement**
Refine this for eighty-one days, nine cycles of nine. When the work is pure and ripe, the response will be as swift as an echo.

Sit upright and composed, settle the mind and concentrate the spirit. After a long while, regulate the breath—eighty-one cycles. One inhalation and one exhalation count as one breath. Gaze downward at the spirit palace, where yang *qi* gradually flourishes. Keep intent fixed on the spirit palace. When eighty-one breaths are complete, Marshal Liu’s true form will be fully realized.

Silently recite and visualize the three syllables *Jiū pán chà* nine times. Envision nine beams of cinnabar light from these syllables converging in the spirit palace to form Marshal Liu’s true form, who then pays homage to the Imperial Master.

Visualize the Yellow Court transformed into the Jade Capital of the Divine Empyrean, where the Jade Pivot Emperor sits cross-legged, grasping a sword, encircled by swirling azure light, with thunder spirits arrayed to his left and right.

Gaze again at the spirit palace. Silently recite the *Chaos Without Form* thunder chapter and the oath chapter. Then, with the two-character summoning incantation □□, recite it in the heart’s voice, look upward toward the *Li* direction, assume a wrathful expression, and open the eyes wide in anger. See the Marshal emerge from the left eye upon a cloud of fire, standing between heaven and earth before you. If summoning rain in clear weather, have him ride a black cloud emerging from the right eye.

Visualize the Heavenly Lord soaring through the empyrean, stirring wind and clouds, as thunder and rain erupt in full force. At this point, clearly summon the Heavenly Lord to the altar, state your intent, and dispatch him.

Then, gaze downward at the Yellow Court and silently recite the *Strategy for Commanding Thunder* chapter—*Chaos Without Form*—once. Each character appears in golden hue.

Again, glare fiercely, eyes wide, and shoot forth two beams of golden light from both eyes. Envision the Marshal riding the golden light away, wielding wind and fire, commanding the *qi* of the *Gang* wind to rise. At *Hai*, fire ignites; at *Mao*, thunder roars, and the decree is executed.

For major matters, recite the two-character incantation □□ eighty-one times; for lesser matters, thirty-six, fifteen, or nine times. Then, draw a long breath through the nose, glare fiercely, and let the spirit follow intent outward. Ascend into the empyrean, where the Heavenly Lord’s true form is distinct.

The preceding method of regular visualization and refinement is called *refining the spirit*. Directing the spirit upward from the Central Palace to the two eyes, so that the spirit follows the gaze outward, is called *exiting the spirit*. When dispatching for practical use, the spirit’s light from the eyes shoots forth, aiding the Heavenly Generals in conveying authority—this is called *dispatching the spirit*. When Marshal Liu is seen, draw him in through the nose, returning from the Muddy Pellet Palace to the original palace—this is called *returning the spirit*. One downward and one upward movement constitute the wondrous function of exit and entry.

The master says: *"When the spirit is settled and *qi* ascends, light emerges and the spirit manifests."*

Recite the incantation:

**Returning the Spirit Incantation**
*"Spirit returns to the spirit palace,
*Qi* returns to the cinnabar origin.
When summoned again, return as before,
All as in the original rite."*

After the incantation, visualize Marshal Liu, the Heavenly Lord, treading a wheel of fire, wielding a golden whip, descending from the Muddy Pellet Palace. Draw him in and return him to the spirit palace, inviting the spirit’s return.

*Guard this well, guard this well.*
*Sealed in accord with the* Cavernous Mystery Purple Empyrean Family Script.

Descendant So-and-so bows a hundred times to seal the covenant.

For the right [document], use yellow paper, two *cun* in width and three and a half *cun* in length. Write the *chen*-hour script, drawing the purple *qi* to form the talisman. Visualize Marshal Ma, the Perfected Lord, with a face like a red jujube, large eyes and ears, golden earrings, wearing a seven-black Daoist crown, purple robe, and black shoes, holding a thunder ruler, standing in the spirit palace. Then, with a single brushstroke, let one *qi* complete the talisman.

The family script is to be conveyed by the Perfected Lord to the presence of the True Man Bai.

**Thunder Chamber Master’s Family Script Covenant Talisman**
For the right talisman, use yellow paper, two *cun* in width and three and a half *cun* in length. Write in vermilion, using the *yin*-hour script, and infuse the talisman with the fire *qi*. Affix it to the square case and reverently present it from superior to inferior.

For urgent matters, use black paper and write to the master’s office to report the emergency.

Whenever writing talismans, first visualize the True Man with a youthful face, topknot, yellow Daoist robe, bare feet, holding a thunder ruler, and convey the message through the Elder True Man to Marshal Ma’s presence.

**Marvelous Transmission of the Bloodline**
The master says: *"Within this lies a thousand-gold secret never to be transmitted. Should it be leaked, calamity will befall the self and extend to the nine generations. Most secret, most secret—most wondrous, most wondrous!"*

**Incense of Faith Talisman**
Summoning the thunder gods at the altar.

At the appointed hour, perform the rain-summoning tally.
*"[Name] commands the thunder to deploy and spread *qi*—
With thunderclaps and lightning, merge with the True *Qi*,
As if the Emperor himself were acting.
Your servant [Name] presents the talisman in reverent report."*

This talisman is to be inscribed on yellow paper, one *cun* and three *fen* in width, nine *cun* in length. Roll the talisman horizontally, bind it with thread, and burn it in the incense censer.

**Talisman Inscription and Activation:**
Whenever inscribing talismans to memorialize the Emperor, proceed as follows:
First, wield the brush while reciting the *Minor Golden Light Mantra* and the *Thunder-Fire Mantra*, thereby establishing the Fire Boundary.
Visualize the single aperture within oneself, wherein the Perfected Person of One’s Original Destiny rides the ancestral qi of Golden Light, ascending with utmost sincerity to the Dipper Treasury of the Celestial Palace.
Next, visualize Fire Light scattering forth, perceiving the Master’s intent.
Then, together with the Master, the Perfected Person of One’s Original Destiny approaches the Great Scarlet Gate, memorializes, and receives the imperial decree. Returning with the Master, each resumes their original place.
Exhale a mouthful of ancestral qi, causing Golden Light to irradiate the paper into a golden hue. As the brush moves, Fire Light coalesces into a circle (O), and divine radiance enters the paper.
Recite: *“By the decree of the Great Scarlet Heavenly Thearch, I command...”* (O) inscribe the talisman.
**General Command Talisman:**
Inhale the southern Fire Qi into oneself.

**Noon Script**
Exhale to release the Azure Circle Talisman, immediately seizing and binding malevolent filth.
Recite the command incantation:
*“By the jade-pure imperial decree of Yuqing, wind and fire swiftly execute the mandate.
On this day, General So-and-so, as the jade script commands, swiftly enforce the fire decree.
Departing at *si* (巳), swiftly pursue and seize at *mao* (卯), with no delay permitted.
Malevolent spirits and wood-demons, each reverently obey the imperial decree.
Should any defy this talismanic command, enforce the celestial mandate.”*
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Great Scarlet Heavenly Thearch’s statutes and decrees command.*

**Eight-Thunder Talisman**
Once the talisman is formed, inscribe the matter’s intent within it.
Command the general: *“Act with utmost urgency, fire blazing at the念’s rise, suffusing the paper with flame-light.”*
Next, recite the heart mantra:
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ douzhu fan ying lei hong she.*
Visualize the general entering the talisman, then recite the *Tianpeng* mantra, empowering and dispatching them with their title.
Recite: *“Wind, fire, and thunder execute the decree—by the Celestial August One’s command.”*
For urgent matters, add the triple strike (⿱⿲⿱⿰⿱⿰).

**General Seizing Talisman**
**Killing Qi** – *Mao* Script
*Oṃ! Heaven’s great axe, hewing the five forms of ghosts.
Flames of the Blazing Emperor scorch blood; the Northern Dipper burns bones to ash.*
*Hasten! Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command and seize.*

For urgent use, write in cinnabar on red paper and affix to the register’s first page.
For routine use, write in cinnabar on yellow paper and place within the register.
Applicable for curing illness, subduing demonic shrines, dispelling pestilence, summoning thunder—no task beyond its reach.

**Talisman for Subduing Wood-Demons and Mountain Specters**
*“By the Supreme Thearch’s decree, execute and behead malevolent spirits at *mao* (卯) and *wei* (未).
At *zi* (子), cinnabar qi burns the void; at *wu* (午), sever the ghost and annihilate its form.
At *chou* (丑), lightning illuminates all; at *wei* (未), report the mandate to the Celestial Court.
At *hai* (亥), General So-and-so of this day; at *si* (巳), enforce the decree to sweep them away.”*
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Great Scarlet Heavenly Thearch’s statutes and decrees command.*

For the **Eight-Thunder Talisman** and **Azure Circle Talisman**, inscribe the intent, recite the heart mantra, and dispatch the general into the talisman.

**Wind Talisman**
*“Within, enter He Yu.”*

**Thunder Incantation**
Thunder possesses generals, commanding wind and clouds.
Seizing and slaying demons, they fiercely aid the thunder’s might.
With my single summons, winds arise across ten thousand leagues.
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Azure Flower Supreme Thearch’s statutes and decrees command.*

**Thunder Talisman**
Inscribe the right talisman with the six characters *pili feng huo ting chi* (霹雳风火霆勑) as a seal. After use, recite the thunder-awakening incantation to activate it. Then intone:
*“By my decree, I summon the Central Heaven’s Thunder-Water Spirit.
At *zi* (子), the Earth’s Thunder-Fire Lord; at *wu* (午), the Altar’s Command unites the qi.
At *si* (巳), summon General So-and-so; in accord with the Vermilion Thearch’s talismanic mandate,
let the thunder resound at once, sweeping away demonic bandits. At *mao* (卯), behead and annihilate the malevolent spirits.

Thunder executes its duty; at *wu* (午), thunder and rain issue forth.
Thunder, fire, lightning, and sun—Minister and Aide, hasten to act!
*Hasten! Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command.”*

**Further:**
*“Wind-Fire-Thunder Mandate, *pili feng huo ting chi* (霹雳风火霆敕).”*
Add the character *lei* (雷) above *yun* (云), then:
*“Thunder One, Thunder Two, Thunder Three, Thunder Four, Thunder Five.
Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, Wind Earl and Rain Master.
Celestial Fire-Thunder Spirit, Terrestrial Fire-Thunder Spirit,
Yang Fire-Thunder Spirit, Yin Fire-Thunder Spirit—
the Five Thunders descend, binding demons and sealing spirits.
*Hasten! Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command.”*

**Recite again:**

the third, the Jade Armillary turns □Xing (星);
the fourth, yin’s light shines upon □Wu (乌);
the fifth, the Great Void moves □Lou (娄);
the sixth, thunder quakes □Jing (井);
the seventh, annihilates demonic calamities, swiftly eradicating misfortune and ghosts.
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Great Scarlet Heavenly Thearch’s statutes and decrees command.”*

**For talismans treating demons**, add this trigram above the character *lei* (雷).
Apply the Five Revolutions, infusing the Five Qi into the talisman.

**Shattering Pearl Talisman**
This talisman serves as the foundation; follow the preceding sequence, then augment it with the Eight Thunders.
Infuse with Fire Qi.

**Right Talisman**
Compose with the *Tianpeng* incantation; within, the *Xuhuo* (欻火) talisman is employed as needed.
Visualize the heart’s fire descending, kidney water ascending, merging with the ancestral qi,
which emerges from the Celestial Eye and is projected inward.
Once the talisman is complete, add the three characters *heng tian ba* (横天霸) at the talisman’s base, then strike the earth with a thunderous crash.

**Dispatching Incantation:**
*“How shall retribution be delivered?”*
If no response manifests, inscribe and dispatch the talisman anew as before,
directing the ancestral qi to emerge from the Celestial Eye, forming the three characters *cheng* (), *chou* (), and *chou* (),
and infusing them into the talisman, resplendent with golden light.

**For all manner of Wood-Demons, Mountain Specters, Five Penetrations, or entities manifesting wanton forms**,
inscribe this talisman in cinnabar, affix it to the head of the document, and burn it in the stove—
response is assured. At the moment of burning, a sound will resonate.
Profound and wondrous, profound and wondrous—do not employ it lightly.

**Wind-Thunder Division Incantation**

At *si* (巳), the might of wind and rain’s soldiers; at *zi* (子), hasten to my left and right.
At *wu* (午), together slay the malevolent spirits.
*Slay! Hasten! Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command.”*

**Escort and Memorial Incantation**
*“By the Great Scarlet Heavenly Thearch’s mandate, I present the Jade Scripture’s edict.
At *zi* (子), General So-and-so of this day; at *si* (巳), fire swiftly pursues the soul.
At *chou* (丑), the hun-po returns to the living; at *mao* (卯), I execute the mandate to sweep them away.
If any dare defy this command, at *wu* (午), I shall report directly to the Thearch’s presence.
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Fire Mandate’s decree compels.”*

**Thunder-Awakening Augmented Incantation**
*“Jade Clarity’s salvation summons the Central Heaven’s Thunder, the Earth’s Thunder at *zi* (子),
the Yin Thunder at *chou* (丑), the Yang Thunder at *si* (巳), the Mountain Thunder at *wu* (午),
the Thunder Marshal at *chen* (辰), the Thunder Soldiers at *wu* (午), the Thunder Clerks,
and the Fierce Clerk Perfected Lord at *si* (巳).
At *mao* (卯), I uphold the Supreme Thearch’s statutes; at *wu* (午), fire swiftly resounds.

At *zi* (子), stone spirits and earth qi; at *chou* (丑), execute and behead inauspicious forces.
At *wu* (午), the sagely deities of the Three Realms heed the command and comply.
Expel and eradicate demonic beings; at the command’s sound, they are overthrown.
When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, ascend together to the Jade Court.
*Hasten! Hasten! As the Jade Clarity Thearch’s decree commands.”*

**Central-Central Extraction**
Add the Eight Thunders to the right talisman.
Upon completion, append additional talismans and inscriptions as desired, recite the heart mantra,
dispatch the general into the talisman, and affix the title.
For the *Wind-Fire-Thunder Mandate* and other titles, adjust according to the gravity of the matter.

**Dispatch as before**, adding *Tianpeng* into the talisman. Inscribe only the three characters *Tianpeng Zhuang* (天蓬庄),
recite the *Tianpeng* incantation, apply cinnabar, and visualize the Fire Qi rising from the brush.

**This talisman is employed to behead major calamities**—inscribe it on tile.
First, burn white charcoal in the stove, then place the tile talisman atop the fire, burning it together with the document and memorial.
For beheading major calamities or urgent dispatches, add a talisman to the reverse of the document.

**For all purposes, its application is boundless.**

**Reverse-Added Talisman**
Recite the *Tianpeng* incantation and complete the inscription.

**Rain-Prayer and Fire-Quenching Talisman**
First inscribe the two characters *chijie* (敕命) beneath the talisman, then connect the upper and lower sections.

**Reverse Fire-Quenching Talisman**
Inscribe on the reverse of the *Rain-Prayer and Fire-Quenching Talisman*.

**Rain-Prayer Response Talisman**
Inscribe the matter upon the talisman, specifying the time limit for the response. Dispatch all from the *xun* (巽) direction.

**Incantation and Mandate**
From the *xun* direction, mist arises; at *si* (巳), before *wei* (未) emerges, the Wind Duke stirs floating clouds; at *xu* (戌), the Rain Master hastens forth. At *kan* (坎), the Marshal of the Day, *wu* (午), swiftly scatters lake waters.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and mandates of the Great Crimson Heavenly Thearch!*

*Xun* descends the mandate; *si* issues the command to rescue.
*Si* emerges.

**Further Incantation and Mandate**
Wind Duke, stir floating clouds; at *wu* (午), the *xun* Lightning Mother raises mist. At *kun* (坤), *si* and *xun* return waters to the river; at *chen* (辰), the willow branch ceaselessly moves. At *wu*, the Marshal of the Day, *zhonghuo* (中火), urgently obeys.
*Yu* (玉) *xu* (戌), Rain Master, heed the command!
*Kan* completes the rain wheel for activation.
*Hai* (亥), *swiftly, swiftly, obey the mandate of the Great Crimson Heavenly Thearch!*

**Cloud-Mist Summoning Talisman**
After inscribing the talisman, recite the following incantation and mandate:
Floating Cloud Messenger, Azure Thunder Messenger, Black Thunder Messenger, the surging *qi* of the East’s verdant depths—*mao* (卯) *wen* (文), Southern Cinnabar, now extinguished.
*Wu* *wen* unites the heart’s *qi*; *zhong wen* (中文), envision the Thearch issuing the mandate to summon the Northern Yin.
The *qi* of Earth and Water, uniting primordial essence, coalesces the *qi* of the Five Directions to spread waterways and mist.
From the *qi* of the Five Viscera, unite the *qi* of the Five Directions to empower the Marshal of the Day. At *wu*, the hidden sources darken; at *zi* (子), swiftly summon the Five Directions—floating clouds arise, mist gathers.
*Zi*, Thunder Soldiers and Messengers; *mao*, fierce fire urgently descends.
The Thearch’s writ is executed: *zi* issues the mandate, *chou* (丑) carries it forth, *chou* carries it forth, *wu* issues the command.

**Wind-Raising, Cloud-Gathering, Rain-Summoning Talisman**

At *mao*, the *wen* emerges at *wu* from the *qi* of *xun* to blow the talisman.

**Summons and Incantation**
Marshal of the Day, at *si*, swiftly roll back the mist; the wind traverses the Six Caverns. In an instant, boundless—floating clouds arise and converge, lingering not a moment, as thunder roars and splits the sky. At *chen*, the might of the Northern Direction shakes all, precisely as the writ commands. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Great One of Grand Crimson Heaven, the Thearch of Heaven, issues the mandate.

**Talisman of the Great One Opening Heaven**
Once the talisman is formed, append □□ *liang* below, then recite the **Incantation for Raising Wind and Clouds**:
*"The *qi* of *xun* stirs wind and mist; the *wen* of *si* returns to *yin*, the Wind Earl summons floating clouds, the Rain Master of *xu* hastens forth. Marshal of the Day, purify and sprinkle the lake’s waters. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Grand Crimson Thearch issues the mandate!"*

At *si*, the writ descends.

Once the right talisman is formed, add the *kan* trigram below. Begin the brushstroke from above, reversing the pen to strike straight downward, piercing the *kan* trigram. Visualize the waters of *kan* flowing backward as rain. Then, ascend with the ancestral *qi*, brush straight upward, and recite the two characters □ *liang*, envisioning the Celestial Stem manifesting to seize its radiance and dispatch the Thunder Gods.

Add two further talismans, **General Talisman for Praying Rain and Quelling Fire**:
**Talisman for Praying Rain**
**Talisman for Quelling Fire**

Then add the five talismans of **Wind, Clouds, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning**, inscribing the name of the Thunder Marshal to command, on such-and-such a day at such-and-such an hour at such-and-such a place, the driving of thunder, the dispatch of lightning, the lashing of dragons, the rousing of hibernating creatures, the stirring of clouds to bring rain, the great bestowal of sweet dew, to succor the withered and parched, and fulfill the people’s hopes. Swiftly, swiftly.

Add the seal.

**Command the Celestial Sovereign.**
**Clouds, mist, and thunder decrees.**
**☵ ☲ ☳**

For the right [talismans], employ the *Tianpeng Incantation* and *Nine Qi Incantation*, then apply [them with liquid]. Dispatch the *Heart Incantation* to summon the generals and infuse the talismans.

**Wind Talisman**
Infuse with *Xun* qi:
*Oṃ.* Green-tongued, jade-toothed, four-eyed elder, Celestial Ding warrior, wielding might to subdue the south and quell evil. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command.

**Yin Talisman for Sealing the Sun**
This talisman seals the four black [directions], gathering yang and restraining yin. Once the transformative script is complete, envision kidney water ascending to the crown of the head, then recite the command incantation:
*Heaven darkens with mist, the Zi earth darkens with mist, the Mao sun blackens to withdraw light, the Kan moon blackens to seal yin.*
*Kan heaven darkens with mist—sun unseen, Zi earth darkens with mist—sealing hidden spirits, Mao sun blackens—Wind Earl stirs dust, Kan moon blackens—Rain Master drives the rain wheel.*
*Kan, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Great Crimson Celestial Emperor’s law and command! Command, command, command, command, command!*

**Kan restrains Wu, five excisions.** Recite the five command characters.

**Method for Gathering Yang and Releasing Yin**
The master circulates kidney water, ascending it to the crown of the head. Next, recite the *Sealing the Four Blacks*:
*Clear skies open, rain seals.*
*First revolution: the Dipper traverses the heavens, the Winnowing Basket.*
*Second revolution: the Purple Court generates the Horn [Star].*
*Third revolution: the Jade Armillary moves the Star.*
*Fourth revolution: yin light emits the Crow.*
*Fifth revolution: the Great Void moves the Straddler.*
*Sixth revolution: thunder quakes the Well [Star].*
*Seventh revolution: slay demonic drought spirits—disasters swiftly vanish.*
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Primordial Celestial Venerable’s law and command.

Once the seven revolutions are complete, inscribe three additional thunder talismans on the reverse side:

**Reverse-Side Thunder Talisman (First)**
**Reverse-Side Thunder Talisman (Second)**
**Reverse-Side Thunder Talisman (Third)**
Also named the *Talisman for Rousing Clouds and Mist*.

For these three talismans, when engaging in great battles or exorcisms, inscribe these three on the reverse as well.

**Talisman for Curing Myriad Illnesses**
Once the talisman is complete, add the trigrams above the "thunder" character, adapting them to the specific matter. For treating a particular ailment, inscribe the corresponding trigram above the *Zhen* character or "thunder," as appropriate.

**Applications of the Eight Trigrams**
- **Thunder-Fire Feng (䷶):** Treats malevolent ghosts, demonic possession, and mania; also aids in hastening childbirth.
- **Thunder-Heaven Great Strength (䷡):** Cures all illnesses and hastens childbirth.
- **Thunder-Marsh Returning Maiden (䷵):** Calms the spirit and stabilizes the will.
- **Water-Thunder Zhun (䷂):** Exorcises spirits, dispatches ghosts, prays for rain, and spreads the five directional qi for the *Dougai* ritual.
- **Thunder-Water Jie (䷧):** Purifies defilement, treats chills and fever; ingested as consecrated water.
- **Thunder-Wind Heng (䷟):** Drives away evil, hastens childbirth, and stops night crying in children (inscribe on tile and place above the stove).
- **Wind-Thunder Yi (䷩):** Treats mania, suppresses anomalies, prays for rain or clear skies, and subdues dragon wells (inscribe on iron plaques).
- **Fire-Thunder Shi Ke (䷔):** Prays for clear skies, seizes possessing spirits, and treats manic evil.

For all talismans, inscribe the names of the Northern Dipper’s stars, revolving them to seal the "thunder" character. On the reverse, write the year, month, day, hour, and the master’s rank before affixing the seal.

For treating illnesses and exorcising evil, proceed with meticulous care and upright conduct, avoiding errors.

**For treating mania, awakening the soul, and purifying defilement:** Gather a mouthful of qi from the void, blow it into the talisman, and fumigate with vinegar and charcoal—most efficacious.

**Incantation for Commanding Talismans**
*Oṃ bhu [ ] shén Qián zhà kuí piāo shè.*
After reciting the incantation, invoke the Dipper’s taboo name over the "thunder" character, revolving it seven times over *Zhen* or "thunder." Add the trigram five times, infuse the five directional qi with the Dipper incantation, inscribe the general’s name, and seal with the intent of the matter.

**For awakening the soul from mania:** Draw fire qi, exhale it into [the talisman], burn and fumigate with oil and vinegar—the smoke will rouse the afflicted instantly.

**For subduing demonic anomalies and splitting rain:** Strike the dragon well, using iron plaques to suppress them.

**For inscribing talismans:** Draw a mouthful of fire qi, hold the breath, and complete the talisman in one breath. Then inscribe the Dipper’s taboo name and the trigram.

It spread widely in the capital and Jiangnan, with many disciples.

*#2 Chen the True Man of Seclusion and Harmony (Xiyi):* Chen Tuan of Mount Hua. According to *Records of the Dharma’s Origins*, Chen Tuan resided on Mount Hua, "receiving the transmission in a stone chamber; this book was passed down in western Shu." Thus, the tradition venerates him as its founding patriarch.

*#3 Liu the True Man of Pervasive Mystery (Tongxuan):* According to *Taiyi Fire Mansion Five Thunder Great Method*, Liu was the second-generation patriarch of the lineage. Styled Haoran, courtesy name Zhongfang, personal name Jin. He served as abbot of the Zhangren Temple on Damianshan in Qingcheng, Chengdu. While at the temple, he subdued the Six Heavenly Demonesses, revealing the Taiyi secret methods. Summoned by Emperor Gaozong of the Southern School to the capital to exorcise palace demons, he propagated the teachings on Qingcheng and was granted the title *Tongxuan*. He ascended at the age of one hundred and fifty.

Liu commanded him to transmit the Dao southward, where he ordained six hundred disciples. *"After receiving the teachings, the Master traveled to the Ning Temple in Jiangnan, was summoned to the palace to subdue demons, resided in two renowned mountains, and later oversaw the Heavenly Market Divine Altar."* His Daoist arts were profound, and he was granted celestial scriptures, bestowed the title *Heavenly Pivot Minister*.

**#5 Yang the True Man of Reclusive Clarity (Qingyin):**
According to *Taiyi Fire Mansion Five Thunder Great Method*, Yang was the fourth-generation patriarch of the lineage. Styled Gengchang, personal name Xie. His ancestral home was Yanping in Fujian. His father served as an instructor at the Shu River estuary, where he encountered Xu the True Man, who bestowed upon him an elixir that restored his youth. Later, Xu the True Man arrived in Yanping and took Gengchang on travels to cultivate the Dao, journeying successively to West Shu, Jiankang, Maoshan, and other places, where he secretly transmitted the great methods. *Records of the Dharma’s Origins* also states: Before Xu the True Man ascended as an immortal, *"he passed down all his teachings—the Thunder Scriptures, the family writings of the Thunder Seal School, the secret seals, the Thunder Bureau Seal, the Great Heavenly Thunderfire Seal, the Heaven-Unifying Seal, and the Celestial Treasure Family Writings Seal."* Gengchang’s mastery of the Dao was profound; *"he summoned and commanded thunder and lightning, manifested stars, prayed for rain or sunshine, and rolled or unfurled clouds and rainbows—all at his beck and call."* Later, he transmitted the great methods to Huang Yunzhuang, Xue Guanxia, and others.

**#6 Huang the True Man of Cloud Manor (Yunzhuang):**
According to *Records of the Dharma’s Origins*, Huang the True Man, styled Yixuan, was a native of Nanpu in Fujian. He studied the Dao under Yang Gengchang, mastering all his secrets.

This is a talisman of the highest prohibition. It must not be lightly disclosed unless one has attained realization, pledged faith, and sworn alliance before the sages. To transgress the mysterious statutes is to invite grave consequences—guard it with reverence.

When inscribing talismans of the Fire Palace, always write while holding the breath.

For treating severe afflictions, add three characters:
*  *.
Also inscribe:
*Thunder Command—Swift Execution*
*Wind-Fire Thunder Command*
*Thunder-Fire Salvation Command*
*Urgent Thunder Command*
*By the Command of the Vermilion Heavenly Sovereign*
*By the Command of the Thunder Ancestral Master*
*Cloud-Mist Thunder Command*
*□ Rinsing the Void*
*□□□*
*□ Numinous Obscurity*

Afterward, affix the seal of the **Great Vermilion Heavenly Emperor of the Fire Palace**.

Among the Three Heaven Memorials, the formats for the **Numinous Treasure Memorial** and **Spiritual Treasure Memorial** are identical. The **Heavenly Treasure Memorial** differs only in the talisman and the secret character for "chariot" on one side.

When employing the Three Heaven Memorials, one must first memorialize the **Great Vermilion Heavenly Emperor**, or **Divine Empyrean**, or petition the **Supreme Unity, Lord of the Dharma, the Venerable Origin**, before proceeding.

Begin with the **Spiritual Treasure Memorial**, followed by the **Numinous Treasure Memorial**, then the **Heavenly Treasure Memorial**—three times in succession. These are used for matters of grave importance and must not be employed lightly.

Additionally, the **Thunder Memorial Format**:

The inner talismans follow the preceding model, written in vermilion for clear skies and in ink for rain.

**Fire Palace Bureau of the Supreme Unity**—this bureau respectfully follows the petitioner’s intent as per the preceding format. This is most urgent and requires compilation.

**Personal Petition in Epistolary Form**

Your disciple, [Surname] [Given Name], humbly styled *Successor of the Teachings, [X]th-Generation Descendant*, prostrates with a hundred bows to reverently address:

**Ancestral Master, Heavenly Pivot, Demon-Quelling Perfected Lord Xu**,
**Master of the Central Axis of Heaven**;
**Ancestral Master, Pure Recluse, Cloud-Splitting Yang the Perfected**,

before whose presence this unworthy one dares not shrink from the axe of presumption, yet ventures to lay bare the sincerity of his cinnabar heart.

With due reverence, I submit this petition on behalf of [Name of Supplicant] of [Native Place], who humbly beseeches healing and deliverance. Having already issued talismans and dispatched missives in accordance with the rites, I dare not act further without authorization and thus present this personal petition for Your Eminence’s gracious perusal.

I most earnestly implore Your Merciful Wisdom to deign to memorialize the Supreme Mystery, beseeching the issuance of a sacred edict to be proclaimed throughout the Three Realms’ true bureaus—those governing the dispensation of calamity and fortune, as well as the courts of the Sacred Peaks, City Gods, and Earthly Magistracies—granting amnesty to [Name of Afflicted], whose transgressions, whether from past lives or present errors, may now be wholly dissolved like melting ice.

Furthermore, I humbly pray for the dispatch of the **Twelve Great Heavenly Generals of the Supreme Unity Fire Palace**, to convene with the [Name of Supplicant]’s **Pacifying Marshal’s Host**, the assembled **Officials and Lords**, and descend without delay to the petitioner’s household. There, in concert with the **Director of Destinies** and the **Local Earth Gods**, they shall investigate the cause of the affliction, apprehend the malevolent spirits perpetrating harm, and escort them to the **Thunder Prisons** for interrogation in the unseen realm. They shall compel the extraction of the **disease-qi**, recover and restore the **living hun-soul**, and execute judgment in accordance with the statutes.

Should any lingering or connected spirits be found, they too shall be enlightened and released, ensuring complete harmony and liberation. The **qi** of all subdued and connected spirits shall be dispatched to the **Realm of Generation**.

This petition is dedicated to [Name of Afflicted], that:
- **Heavenly disasters** be averted above,
- **Earthly misfortunes** be dispelled below,
- **Pestilence** be quelled and dispersed,
- **Auspicious omens** be summoned and gathered.

Moreover, I beseech the diffusion of **orthodox qi** to irrigate the **fields of the body**, that [Name of Afflicted]’s:
- **Six pulses** be harmonized,
- **Hundred passages** flow unimpeded,
- **Medicines** take effect,
- **Afflictions** be cured and peace restored,
- **Lifespan** be extended,
- **Fortune** be perpetually secured.

Should this plea be granted, I shall owe my very existence to Your Grace. Daring to trespass upon Your august authority, I remain, with trembling reverence, awaiting Your merciful command.

Respectfully submitted.

You are now charged with bearing this personal petition to the Master’s court. Present it with utmost clarity and urgency, for the journey through the clouds is swift, and a prompt response is awaited.

*Sealed by: [Surname] [Given Name], [Official Title]*

**Ritual of the Threefold Purity**

As customary, the Master closes his eyes, collects his spirit, and assumes the *sword mudra* with both hands at his waist. Lifting his gaze, he transforms his spirit, becoming the **Perfected One of Original Destiny**.

The incantation is spoken:
*"By the Wheel of the Northern Emperor, swiftly transform this body."*

Three strikes upon the table, a single stick of precious incense offered—
the Ten Directions grow solemn and clear.
Three rolls of the ritual drum—
the myriad spirits assemble in full.

**Fire Palace of the Supreme Unity, Thunder Bureau of the Capital.**
Burning incense, the summons is issued to the appointed *jing*-shrine on duty this day, and to the **Merit-Recording Attendant**.
*"Hear now this summons—hasten to the altar without delay!"*

Swiftly!
*"Vast and obscure, dark and profound,
Heaven and Earth share the same origin.
Scattered, they form qi;
gathered, they take shape.
At the call, instantly arrive;
at the summons, instantly appear."*

By this offering of true incense, the summons is issued to **Direct Talisman-Officer Xie You, Bai Shen, and Ji Maoqing**—
*"Present yourselves before the altar at once to receive orders!"*

Swiftly!
The *ruyi* ritual is performed, the petition dispatched.

**The Ancestral Master parts the clouds to receive the petition, summoning forth its profound mysteries.**

The Master’s left hand forms the *chen* trigram, resting upon his heart;
his right hand forms the *xu* trigram, covering his kidneys.
Left raised, right lowered.
Eyes closed, then slightly opened—
he draws in the **fire-qi of the Xun Palace**, swallowing it into his cinnabar field.
He visualizes the **Water and Fire uniting**, heart and kidneys joined,
ascending from the *weilu* to the spine, the **two qi merging in the Crimson Palace**.
His heart holds the blazing fire, and before him appears **Marshal Xie**.

Then he recites the incantation:
*"Oṃ."*

*"□□-jūníngduō-pó□qiéyē-wūlì□yēlìlì-lìjíjí-fáfá. Swiftly, swiftly, gather! Oṃ. Hūm hūm! The Brahmā-responds, thunder roars, seize!*

Visualize the *Direct Talisman* arriving at the altar.

**Incantation:**
*Four Direct Merit-Officials, transmit commands, convey sincerity.
Between heaven and earth, they come and go like clouds.
Hearing my summons, descend swiftly!
Swiftly, swiftly, swiftly!*

The petition is presented.

**Incantation:**
*Now I submit this memorial—before the altar, attend and await.
What I petition, what I desire, the Marshal’s decree is the *chen* trigram.
Convey it before the Emperor, the Jade Script awaits prostrate.
The Thunder Bureau: the *zi* trigram, the *wu* emerges.*

Reverently invite:
**Supreme Unity Fire Mansion’s Master of Dharma, Commander-in-Chief Li Yuanjun;

*May you deign to cast your radiance and descend to this altar.
Recite the Master’s secret incantation."*

To the Three Heavens above, we memorialize;
to the Five Peaks and Four Waterways below, we command.
You marshal the thunder hosts,
pray for rain and the clouds obey your talismans.
You chariot the rains and drive the winds,
bestowing profound grace and conferring blessings.
In reverent succession of the Teaching,
we pray you descend upon cloud-cranes.
To expel and seize: your sleeves summon the ice soldiers,
flying thunder wields lightning.
You chariot the rains and pursue the winds,
all deviant and perverse ghosts are illuminated and bound by the law.
All petitions and vows set forth below,
may each be granted as spoken.

Further incantation:
Heavenly *ding-ding*, earthly *ling-ling*,
yin and yang conjoin, the Thunder Department manifests form.
Swiftly, swiftly!
Visualize the azure, vermilion, and white *qi* gathering in the palace of the heart,
the tongue pressing the upper palate, *qi* issuing before the eyes as flames of fire—
the Master has descended to the altar,
with the Department’s officials and generals arrayed to left and right.
The Dharma Master offers obeisance, presents tea,
advances the wine thrice, and silently memorializes the matter at hand.
The family letter is presented; kneeling, one intones the prayer.

When dispatching the generals, proclaim the incantation aloud:
“I, by Heaven’s mandate, hold the talismans and seals.
I assist and uphold the thunder’s might, presiding over commands and decrees.
Swift as wind and fire, the Dharma spreads;
rapid as wind and thunder, my orders fly.
I command you—dare not disobey in the slightest.
The altar bears official documents; heed and proclaim them.”

Proclamation of the Summons:
“The documents of summons just now presented
have been fully declared.
Follow the Fire Decree—swiftly obey!
Fierce generals of the Thunder Department,
spirits of the day’s direct charge,
with a single spray of Dharma-water,
hasten to the Celestial Court.
I bear the Great Dharma—delay not!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the thunder-fire’s law commands!”

The Thunder Bureau further intones:
Heavenly thunder rumbles low,
earthly thunder roars aloud.
Sun and moon arrayed in ranks,
illumine me with clarity.
Heaven-appointed generals,
dare not tarry or delay!

At my altar’s fore, I stand awaiting response.
Heavenly thunder rumbles low,
the Hour Spirit’s thunder roars aloud.
Mao Dragon’s thunder stirs the waters,
Yin Water’s thunder churns the waves.
Chou Earth’s thunder commands the hosts,
Zi’s thunderbolts strike crosswise.
With the divine mechanism’s single release,
demonic spirits are beheaded and destroyed.
Twelve mighty generals—
hasten to dispatch the thunder’s might.
By the Supreme Emperor’s urgent decree, swiftly obey!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Thunder Sovereign’s law commands!

Spray the Dharma-water, activate the Thunder Bureau.
Visualize Generals Xie and Ji bearing the missive,
parting clouds and mist as they depart.
Visualize golden light crisscrossing,
the dispatched generals and scribes holding the talismans,
proceeding straight to the Great Unity’s Fire Palace.
Activate the Thunder Bureau—
step the Dipper’s stem through the Three Terraces,
prostrate upon the earth, the Flying Stem shielding the body.

Incantation:
Mind divine, spirit sacred,
heavenly sage, earthly numen.
Yin and yang conjoined,
creation’s form made one.
A single qi pervades all—
no wish unfulfilled.
Spirit clear, qi refreshed,
directly reaching the thunder’s realm.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Purple Tenuity Emperor of the North Pole’s decree!

Visualize the ancestral master, kneel and bow to receive the mandate.
Upon completion, return to position, click the teeth, and withdraw.

Rise—Cloud-Covering Star Talisman.
Incantation of empowerment.

Dark clouds gather thick,
auspicious qi stands dense.
Lightning flashes bright,
sun and moon shut still.
Star officials withdraw their stations,
all phenomena sink into blackness.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Thunder Sovereign’s statutes and decree!

The right talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on new tile and five-colored paper, bound with the Thunder Bureau’s register, burned beneath the Dipper, while silently reciting the preceding incantation.

**Great Rain-Halting Talisman**
For petitioning the Dipper to send rain, use this same talisman, inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper.

**Rain-Stopping, Cloud-Dispersing Talisman**
Incantation for empowering the preceding two talismans:

On this day, Marshal So-and-So,
Marshal Cui Yuan of the Fire Wheel,
sweeps aside clouds and mist—
the noon yang qi surges to heaven.
The yin qi of *wei* is gathered and stilled,
the *si* Kan Palace concealed,

Incantation of empowerment:
The sun emerges from the *mao* Palace,

Inscribe the preceding talismans in cinnabar on red paper, layer three into one. Place the earlier prayer-for-rain talisman above to blow apart dark clouds, dispatching generals to convey the intent within. Cover with the rain-extinguishing talisman, bind the petition’s head to the tile, and burn as desired to send forth.

**Celestial Decree**
By the Supreme Emperor’s command, jade dispels and demons perish.
If *sha* spirits follow the flow, ghosts shall not be slain;
if at *yin* they rebel, ghosts shall bear the consequence.
When *sha* spirits hear my law,
their destined mountains and rivers dissolve into clouds.
At *shen*, my body and soul settle;
at *wu*, the seven *qi* descend.
At *wu*, guard the upright *qi*,
and within the center, spontaneity achieves perfection.

at *you*, evil dragons are annihilated.

**Talisman of the Supreme Lord for Dispersing Clouds and Summoning the True Bureau**
When the right talisman is inscribed, black clouds revolve and enter the Five Generals. At the appointed hour, inscribe the names of the Five Generals, the cloud-□ dragon, and the thunder-□ to be employed for rain, then merge them into the talisman. Visualize black clouds surging from your kidneys into the talisman.

**Secret Incantation**
*Om bhu □ shen qian chi.*
*Kui ni xing cha she.*
**Talisman for Opening the Heart and Tongue #2** (May be used to summon thunder deities.)

For the talisman to part the clouds, recite: *"Let the Four Numinous Ones act!"* Activate the talisman above. When inscribing at home, sit for a moment, then burn it to receive a response.

**Silent Memorial in the Heart**
For grave matters, light one incense stick. Before you, summon the generals and officers, make your declaration, bow thrice, rise, sit, and knock your teeth together. Silently recite the memorial in your heart, praying with focused intent.

Recite the **Incantation for Commanding the Spirits Within the Body**, then inscribe the **Talisman for Opening the Heart** with the tip of your tongue. Next, inscribe the **Talisman for Mounting the Crane** beneath your seat. Naturally, a trance-like state will descend—await the spontaneous response.

When finished, recite the **Incantation for Returning to the Spirits**, rise, and proceed as you will.

**Talisman for Opening the Heart**
**Talisman for Mounting the Crane #3**

Recite the **Minor Golden Light Incantation**, visualizing black and white *qi* within, as golden light subtly approaches. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth, enveloping your body.

**Incantation**

By the authority of the Jade Emperor, I command and seize.
*Om.*

*Hūm.* Zhā, soaring through the vaulted heavens, hasten into the Mud-Palace.
By the decree of the Jade Emperor, I command and seize.

**Talisman for Praying for Rain**

**Incantation**
By the Emperor’s decree and mandate,
I summon the Thunder Gods.
Envoys of Horn and Neck constellations,
let thunderbolts cleave the sky.
Envoys of the Wind Earl,
let your wings shatter all ill.
Drive the dragons, seize the lightning,
Jiang and Bi, set the winds in motion.
This talisman is issued—
let rain come swiftly.
Hasten, hasten, by the statutes and decrees of the Thunder Bureau!

The talisman is inscribed in *mao*-script, with eastern *qi*, and struck within the Thunder Formation. For specialized use in summoning clouds and seizing lightning, write it on brick with water from a dragon well. In practice, internal refinement requires diligent and constant effort. The disciple invokes the master, and the master never leaves the disciple. When my body moves, the spirits are present—suddenly, they appear before me. Collect the spirit, settle the breath, and recite the **Great Majestic Virtue Incantation**. Visualize my body filled with thunder and fire, the Cinnabar Heaven’s realm within a single aperture—my primordial spirit in its true form. Recite the *Om Hūm* **Eight Gates Thunder-Shaking Incantation**. See the Infant Brother ascend to the Heart Palace and Dipper Mansion, where the firelight bursts open—this is the Fire Realm, vivid as if before your eyes. See the master follow my primordial spirit to the crown, where the Great Vermilion Heavenly Emperor appears. Kneel in reverence, make your petition, and request the dispatch of Li the Invocator and other generals—all may receive the imperial decree. Then return the spirit, recite the *Hūm* **Soaring Incantation**, and restore the primordial chamber to the primordial spirit. Recite the **Nine Qi Incantation** once, exhaling *qi* forcefully from the Celestial Eye while expelling heart-*qi* with a sigh. Then recite the *Om Hūm Hūm* **Dōu-Shù Incantation** without counting the repetitions. Envision the generals arrayed before you, then recite the **Nine Qi Incantation** once more. When the ritual matter is complete, recite the **Minor Golden Light Incantation**. Restore the spirit to the primordial chamber as the primordial spirit, then recite the **Great Majestic Virtue Incantation** to reinforce it.

**Secret Incantation for Summoning the Generals**
Utmost secrecy—do not reveal lightly.
*Om Hūm Hūm Dōu-Shù Fàn Yìng Léi Hōng Shè.*

**General Command Talisman and Incantation**
Used for praying for clear skies, praying for rain, or dispelling malevolence—this is the esoteric name of the Great One, not to be carelessly disclosed.
*Wù yóu shōu, guī Huìchāng.*
Gather the myriad *qi*, enter the Primordial Palace.
*Shè.*

**Incantation for Urgent Dispatch** (inscribed above)
*Ōm Tū □ Hē Ōm Fù Yē.*
By the great teachings of the ancestral masters, I decree.

**Incantation for Exiting the Spirit**
*Jīn jīn, all are myself,*
*□□□□ indeed.*
Is this my will? Sing, *Yē Chāng Jīng Yē.*
*Jīn fā zhā fèng,* I invoke and entreat,
to guard the numinous grotto-heaven.
The ten thousand images, the forest of phenomena,
all shake the Dharma drum.
The Guardian of the Soul, the King and Lord,
and the eighty-four thousand body spirits,
stand in attendance at my left and right.
Now, with spirit discerned and will steadfast,
I call forth the true officials of the five bodily constituents,
the thunder clerks and soldiers.
With me, let my spirit soar
to the distant celestial gates.
Let my memorial be presented,
reaching the Emperor’s throne.
Let all I do and all I direct
be as I wish.

**Urgent Incantation**
*Ōm Hūm! The thunderclap shakes and stirs the Eight Gates to harmonize with the celestial rhythm—Hī! By decree.*

The radiance of the platform ascends from the *Niwan*; the luminous spirit swiftly rushes to the *Dihu*. The hidden essence acts as my courier—I uphold the Jade Decree of the Primal Chaos.

For all ritual matters, one must begin at the fourth quarter of the *yin* hour. Enter the chamber, gaze inward with the eyes, and exhale three breaths of impure *qi*. Then, draw in the primordial azure *qi* of the Origin through the nose, press the tongue to the upper palate, and stir the divine water of the *Huachi*. Guide the azure *qi* downward into the *Dantian*.

Next, visualize entering the single point between the two kidneys. Close the eyes and imagine the left eye as the sun, the right as the moon. The *yin* and *yang* *qi* unite and descend into the azure *qi* of the *Dantian*. Abide in stillness, allowing the *qi* to rise naturally to the heart, then return to the kidneys.

After a moment, the two *qi* converge in the *Huangting*, coalescing into a golden orb of light, akin to a fire-forged cinnabar elixir. The body is no longer one’s own—only the five *qi* emerge from the five viscera, encircling this golden orb of light. It ascends along the spine to the *Niwan*. Suddenly, the golden light parts, revealing a true person, identical to one’s original form, merging into oneness with the self.

After a moment, visualize the true person emitting a *qi* from the *Niwan*, which divides into the Three Clarities, the Eight Realms, the myriad celestial emperors, and the marshals and clerics of this method. Then, make your petition as desired.

When finished, abide in stillness once more, beholding only the golden orb of light. Draw it back into the *Huangting*. Profound and wondrous—guard this secret.

**Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Six**
**Inner Essentials of the Three Palaces**

**#1 Fire Master** states:
When summoning rain like strands of rope, there must be thunder and lightning. If there is no wind, invoke the Wind Earl Divine Lord. Should the Wind Earl fail to arrive, flooding may ensue—hasten to return to the altar and offer thanks for the rain. Inscribe two "Returning Phoenix" talismans, burn them with peach wood and fragrant fire, and offer ten portions each of gold spirit-money and celestial steeds, burning them according to the five directions at the appropriate location. Once the rain flows freely, proceed without delay; do not linger.

First, at the place of governance and tranquility, enter the chamber, settle the mind, and stabilize the spirit. Gather the myriad thunder *qi* and return them to their origin before departing elsewhere. Let none know of this.

**Secret Methods for Wind, Thunder, Rain, Clear Skies, and Clouds:**
- **Sound *yāo*:** Store the ancestral *qi* in the lungs.
- **Exhale from the Celestial Eye (sound *hōng*):** Store the ancestral *qi* in the liver; gallbladder *qi* issues from the Celestial Eye.
- **Sound *huī*:** Ancestral *qi*.
- **Kidney Palace arises (sound *xū*):** Ancestral *qi*.
- **Heart Palace arises (sound *xī*):** Ancestral *qi*.
- **Kidney Palace arises:** Employ the preceding secrets as needed to summon wind, thunder, rain, clear skies, or clouds. Inscribe within a circle and silently circulate the divine mechanism—efficacy lies in utmost sincerity.

**The Jade Emperor’s Personal Thunder Mechanism:**
Face the appropriate direction, set up an incense table, and the summoned deities will arrive instantly.

**Directions for Stepping the Dipper and Flying the Incantation:**
1. *Wù* (5th Earthly Branch)
2. *Sì* (6th)
3. *Wǔ* (7th)
4. *Wèi* (8th)
5. *Yín* (3rd)
6. *Mǎo* (4th)
7. *Chén* (5th)
8. *Hài* (12th)
9. *Zǐ* (1st)
10. *Chǒu* (2nd)
11. *Shēn* (9th)
12. *Yǒu* (10th)

Face the designated direction, draw the Dipper’s *qi*, and blow toward it. To rouse thunder, burn the talisman in that direction to provoke its force.

**Thunder Master’s Teachings:**
Beyond the heart, there is no method; the method arises from the heart. When the heart is settled, *qi* gathers; when *qi* gathers, spirit gathers; when spirit gathers, the myriad spirits assemble, and golden light converges from all directions.

**Sound *yā yā* □:**
These three *qi* are the ancestors of the ten thousand *qi* and the origin of the myriad spirits. Employ them to open the eight windows and activate the nine orifices. The spirits emerge from emptiness, disperse into form, and when concealed, return to the Six Harmonies, hidden within mountains and peaks. Then, close and still them, recite the *Golden Light Thunder-Restraining Mantra* to halt their movement.

**Secret Thunder Summons Text:**
The three circles above are to be inscribed in three rows, following the primary summons talisman.

Inscribe this text and there is no need for talismans or subsequent summons; use the summons and there is no need for the decree.

**Decree Summons Talisman**
For all talisman-inscribing, first recite the incantation:
*"Heaven clarifies, earth purifies, the Three Lights shine as one.
Cinnabar heavens radiate, the Five Talismans unite in numinosity.
The Primordial Beginning issues its command, summoning [the spirits] to descend before the imperial court.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the order of the Jade Emperor’s decree!"*

*"Within the Mysterious Chamber, on the Central Mound, virtue shines forth—by law and command!"*

After the incantation, visualize the two Great Primordial Masters, Luo Hui and Jing Yao, bearing banners and staffs, clad in vermilion robes with voluminous sleeves, riding purple clouds to the altar. Inhale *qi* once, exhale onto the paper and brush, then inscribe the talisman.

**Primordial Beginning’s Single *Qi***
*"Celestial Origin blends with the Undifferentiated—
The Five Viscera and Five Palaces, the dual *qi* intertwine.
The myriad forms circulate—
Transforming shapes, Heaven’s Domain encompasses all.
The net of Heaven and Earth weeps ghosts and mourns spirits,
Seizing and binding drought-demons, shattering temples, dispelling misfortune.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the law and command of the Divine Empyrean Sovereign!"*

Direct a single *qi* into the talisman, inscribing the eight talismans of the four deities: Cui Ziwen, Shi Guizhang, Jade Clarity’s Jade Maiden Xuan Feiying, and the Celestial Lad Luo Qingyang.

Recite the incantation again:
*"By the Emperor’s decree, the host of spirits is summoned.
Crushing mountains, toppling peaks, thunderclaps strike with terror.
Dragon-spirits swiftly assemble, hurling fire and ringing bells.
The fourfold command converges—who dares not attend?
Defy the talisman, resist the decree, and face celestial punishment.
All follows the law and command of the Jade Clarity True King!"*

**Dusk’s Array of Constellations Talisman**
*"In the Great Beginning’s chaos, the Supreme Ultimate’s obscurity,
The Primordial Simplicity established, the Two Modes encircled.
Forms unite, Three and Five interweave, Four and Seven traverse—
The luminous Three-Five Generals,
Before the peaks, twelve phrases—
Dark spirits arrive at thunder’s roar.
Each phrase is intoned once, each stroke is traced once.
The Lord of All Heaven’s Thunder, the Thunder that Shakes the Wind,
Azure Thunder’s red *qi* stirs, pressing the Nine Palaces.
Crimson Thunder’s white *qi* ascends, roaming the Mysterious Vault.
Yellow Thunder’s green *qi* thunders across the empty sky.
Black Thunder’s yellow *qi* fills the Supreme Ultimate’s origin.
White Thunder’s black *qi* descends, roaming the Dark Feng.
The Fire of Heaven’s Thunder blazes, the crimson wind—
What spirit does not submit? What ghost does not obey?
The Black Calendar of the Northern Numinosity, the Nine Uglies’ Purple Lads,
Wind Earls and Rain Masters drive thunder, drinking rainbows.
The moment this divine talisman arrives, myriad ghosts vanish without trace.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Jade Emperor’s decree!"*

**Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Vault, Heaven-Supporting, Mist-Embracing Great General**
*"Wei Xiongfei, now drive the thunder swiftly forth!"*

**Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Vault, Lightning-Bearing, Thunder-Soaring [General]**
*"Zhang Hongke, now drive the thunder swiftly forth!"*

Visualize the two generals in golden armor, green-faced:
Wei, one hand forming the Dipper seal, the other wielding a sword;
Zhang, one hand supporting a mountain, the other holding a sword,
with lightning flashing forth from beneath the mountain.

**Decree Incantation**
*"The Dao Lord transforms and operates, the Xiang River’s stars align."*

"Let the Lord not turn eastward in vain; the Capital Master responds to the numinous.
All stars submit and yield; the Nine Victories Terrace shines.
The Yellow River’s Capital and Luo’s auspices transform through the Nine Caverns.
The tiger’s whip commands awe; fortune and virtue hold total authority.
Proceed with urgency to deliver the decree; the Great Beginning’s mandate is transmitted.
The Capital Thunder obeys the edict, receiving its charge from Prior Heaven.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Dao’s Ancestor, the Primordial Yang’s Most Honored Law commands!"

The Master says: "These twelve positions are the Thunder’s Six Directions’ Seat, the Assembly of Star Numinous Officials and Immortals, the Celestial Stem qi surging forth. Align them with the monthly generals and corresponding stems; all talismans employ this qi to empower them."

**Three Sovereigns’ Nine Stars True Summons Talisman**

Wind, clouds, rain, and lightning drive and expel for me.
The Primordial August’s true qi circulates through the axis of Heaven and Earth.
Wind chariots, thunder chariots, fire chariots—
rouse the hidden dragons and concealed serpents, the earth spirits’ kindred.

Dare any disobey? Fengdu shall annihilate your form.
The Primordial August issues this decree—
hear the command and swiftly obey!
All gods and spirits of the Three Realms
shall universally heed my order.
Do not transgress the appointed hour.
I stand before the altar, awaiting immediate response.

*"Om! Seize and sever! The Five Directions’ Five Thunders!
Om! Wind-Fire Chaluo, Jiuluo Shanjou!
Tuohao Meng Huang, Jing Zhao Zhen Zong!
Transform swiftly into spirits; let wind and rain rage!
Gan!"*

For the right Thunder Mudra, visualize the spirit entering the talisman as wind-thunder-fire chariots and black clouds emerge from the ears.

**Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman**
This talisman embodies the profound mechanism within thunder. Those who receive and uphold it shall daily recite the *Gathering Spirits and Summoning Thunder Grotto Chapter*, commanding the thirty-six divisions of Divine Empyrean fire officials to ensure success, ascension to immortality, and the eradication of demonic miasmas.
Write in cinnabar and ingest; the thunder gods of the Three Realms shall bow in reverence.
It is the soul of Heaven’s Perfected, the might of the Supreme Sages.
Write the talisman, drawing the southeast Xun qi into it.
Recite the *Grotto Chapter* incantation fourteen times, drawing in the southeast qi, and augment it with the Golden Light Incantation’s numinous script.
Practice diligently, and the thunder gods shall naturally commune with the spirit—thus shall the Dao of immortal ascension be attained.

The Heavenly Emperor decrees—
I summon your form!
Do not disobey the command, lest you rebel against the pure.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands!"*

Within a purified chamber, present offerings to the true forms of the great spirits. Open the Qian trigram and break the Xun trigram, then bury this *Returning Phoenix True Talisman*. Pour water toward the four directions, recite the *Wooden Lad’s Incantation*, and spray the water—response shall be immediate.

**Wooden Lad’s Incantation**

Recite the True King’s Oral Decree:

**Oath-Chapter**
Spirits of fierce thunder, might shaking the Nine Celestial Courts,
Moving within the Three Realms, loyal and diligent aides to the Imperial Lord.
Encased in a body of ten thousand fathoms, known as the honored ones of the Thunder Division.
Commanding all thunder spirits, Wind Earls, Rain Masters,
Mothers of lightning and thunder, and the mighty Yakṣa hosts.
If you who receive and uphold this,
I shall swiftly manifest my form.
I dispatch you to the celestial realms to present tribute and audience before the Imperial Lord;
I dispatch you to the earthly prisons to reach the depths of the Nether Courts;
I dispatch you to the watery palaces to arrive at the Fusang Palace.
I dispatch you to seize demonic essences and shatter the encampments of ghosts.
Should any violate the celestial laws, nine generations shall suffer poisonous punishments.
If I betray you, may the sun and moon in the heavens darken,
May the springs beneath the earth dry up, may grasses and trees cease to grow.
Forever bound as a ghost of the dark netherworld, unable to ascend to the Supreme Clarity.
On the days of *rén* and *guǐ*, I descend—those who uphold this must be diligent.
Offer pure tea and jujube broth, burn peachwood incense.
I shall manifest at your left and right—calm your heart, do not fear.
Together, let us vow to save all beings.
I act by the decree of the Jade Emperor.

**Ten-Character Incantation**

Evil essences and ghostly thieves—nowhere to flee.
Swiftly eradicate them; receive and act accordingly.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Thunder Ancestor, the Emperor’s Decree commands!

**Uniting with the Spirit**
First, visualize the Thunder Citadel at the *Xun* Gate, wreathed in flames and fire-light for ten thousand fathoms.
The practitioner’s eyes should mentally inscribe the two characters "Imperial Decree," which fly into the Thunder Citadel.
Lord Xin, upon seeing these characters, mounts a fire-cloud ten thousand fathoms high, leading the hosts of thunder, lightning, hail, Thunder Lords, Lightning Mothers, Wind Earls, Rain Masters, the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder Envoys, and ten thousand thunder soldiers. They ride the fire-clouds, fire-light, winds, and hail, emerging from the Thunder Citadel to descend before the practitioner.

Next, visualize the *qi* of the gallbladder palace turning azure, giving birth to Lord Xin within. He emerges from the Mud Pill Palace, uniting with the external form as one. The central *qi* envelops and stabilizes, allowing the practitioner to entrust their intent and await the response.

Next, visualize the talisman’s entry. As with uniting the spirit, inhale the liver *qi*, drawing it from the Mud Pill into the gallbladder palace. Act immediately, reciting the **Subduing Thunder Qi Incantation** seven times:

**Incantation**
I receive the wondrous Five Thunder Dharma; the Lightning Mother’s mighty voice.
When drawn in, it preserves the body and nurtures life; when released, it binds ghosts and devours essences.
Expelling the myriad poisons from within the body, all beings regain their living forms.
I now command the generals of the Five Thunders, the Six *Jiǎ* and Six *Dīng*,
To sever the hundred ghosts and draw out the thousand essences.
True *qi* in ten thousand streams pours into my stomach’s blossom.
By the Supreme Decree, fierce scribes with silver fangs—
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Thunder Ancestor, the Emperor’s Decree commands!

Upon completing the incantation, visualize the Heavenly Lord riding fire-light ten thousand fathoms high entering the gallbladder palace.
Next, visualize azure *qi* entering the gallbladder, with lightning flashes and thunderous roars all converging within.
Then, visualize nine streams of eastern azure *qi* entering the liver,
Three streams of southern red *qi* entering the heart,
Seven streams of western white *qi* entering the lungs,
Five streams of northern black *qi* entering the kidneys,
And one stream of central yellow *qi* entering the spleen.
Recite the **Great Heavenly Thunder Lord Incantation** from before, prostrate in reverence, and conclude.

While writing, employ the Living Thunder Formation and return it to the *Kǎn* position.
Add further: □□□□□□□.
Recite the oath-chapter while anointing.
Then invoke the Transverse Heaven Conqueror.
Refine the spirit—press the Thunder Formation with both hands upon the kidneys, visualize golden light arising within them, and circulate the ancestral *qi* upward to both eyes. From their center, golden light issues forth, piercing open the *Xùn* gate. Behold the azure *qi*; within it, purple *qi* intertwines and surges.

Recite the summoning incantation:
*Oṃ. Hūṃ hūṃ jīlī lài yě svāhā.*
One breath, seven repetitions.
Draw azure *qi* through the nose into the gallbladder palace, where it merges with the ancestral *qi* in the Central Cinnabar Field.
Next, with the light of the left eye, inscribe one *hòng* character; with the right eye’s light, one *gǔ* character; and with the tongue, one *gèn* character. Visualize the three characters in azure, crimson, and white hues suspended in the void.
Inhale through nose and mouth, swallowing the locus where the Five Phases engender one another, then overcome one another until reaching the center. Exhale the *hòng*, *gǔ*, and *gèn* characters, driving them upward to the Heavenly Gate.
The Heavenly Gate splits open—envision the Jade Emperor and offer prayers.
Proceed to present your petition silently, reciting the three characters thrice.
Upon completion, behold a Perfected One holding a golden tablet inscribed with the three-character talismanic heading.
Draw forth the heading and blow it into the talisman.
Recite the secret incantation seven times:
*Oṃ. Zhāo [ ] dā nǎ hūṃ hūṃ jīlī shè.*

Exhale azure *qi*, which hovers above the incense burner and transforms into a marshal, merging into one.

Recite the binding incantation:
*Oṃ. [ ] diàn léi pīlì [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] xī rù dǎn zhù.*

Then circulate the Five *qi* within the heart, ascending through the seven joints of the *wěilǘ* cavity to the crown. Strike the thunder formation five times—perceive the thunder’s roar, ears resounding with its clamor, eyes flashing with lightning, nose exhaling black clouds, mouth issuing rain, and black winds rising behind the elbows. Envision wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning intermingling. Burn one talisman—this is the Talisman of Marshal Xīn.

Invoke the essence of the Wing Mansion and the numen of the Six *gēng* Days.

Recite the seven-character incantation as before:
*Oṃ. huǒ lī hōng zhà póhē.*

Strike the thunder formation toward the *xùn* direction.

In all prayers, concentrate the mind to assist the marshal—response will be swift. Then perform the Dipper Rite:
*Oṃ. mǎo [ ] chén lóu zhōng shàng jī zhōng zhōng lī duì suō zǐ hē.*

Conclude by covering the ears and striking outward.

**Incantation of the Five Phases Engendering and Overcoming One Another**

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree!*

**Summoning the Thunder’s Ruling Star**
Recite the *Breaking Earth, Summoning Thunder Yu-Step Incantation*, one phrase per step, each step envisioning wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning.

**Breaking Earth, Summoning Thunder Yu-Step Incantation**
The Divine Elder receives the mandate,
The Jade Emperor summons the thunder hosts.

Issue the command, and they must obey at once!

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree!*

From the lungs, white qi emerges as mountains,

Without the eyes, within the liver responds.
From the liver, green qi emerges as wind,

If treating diarrhea, add the character "mountain" (山) within the talisman.
**Incantation:**
The Six Jias and Six Dings drive the mountain swiftly downward.
*Mountain character hand seal.*

If treating loss of appetite, add the *Golden Light of Merit* beneath the two strokes.
**Incantation:**
Golden light of merit,
Gently dispels the dark and hidden.

A thousand spirits, layered in primordial harmony,
Ever dwell within the twelve towers.
Hasten to proclaim the Lingbao decree,
Roam freely among mortals.

For upper diaphragm disorders, direct the brush upward.

Then blow it into the talisman.

Thunderous fierce officer Xin Hanchen,
Green-faced, eyes blazing, fangs like silver.
Mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks harbor demon spirits—
With a single thunderclap, they crumble to dust.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*

*Fahai Yizhu*, *Spring* Volume Six, concludes.

---
**Nine Heavens Thunder-Crystal Envoy’s Sanskrit-Qi Hidden Script Mechanism**
*Fahai Yizhu*, Volume Seven

**Black Boar Crossing the River**

For all prayers, visualize the Heavenly Mechanism of the Southern Dipper—when a star rains, water-clouds arise; when it dims, fire-clouds arise. Clearly, the star is neither red nor white, but the color of azure glass.

Summon the Envoy to arrive, read the memorial, and repeatedly instruct them. Visualize the Envoy leading ten thousand thunder deities, bearing the command ○ into the starlight, where all is silent and no sound remains.

On the following day, fulfill the appointed time for response, acting as before. The Envoy wields a great axe, leading the thunder deities to bear the command into the star and execute the task.

Then recite the personal incantation, the general summons for the thunder deities, and the incantation for their service. See the Envoy leading the thunder deities, riding clouds and mounting dragons to the altar—black clouds darken the sky, thunder roars, and lightning flashes, all arising at once.

The Master says: *"When the Dipper’s handle is overturned and the heavens darken, this is inner work."* For outer application, the talisman must align—if clouds and qi respond on the first night, then inner and outer efforts will manifest their effect by the next day.

**Talisman Method for Stirring and Exciting**

For the stirring method, use swallow’s blood and mud from a swallow’s nest to grind ink and inscribe the Envoy’s talisman. Write the Four Celestial Quarters in cinnabar at the four corners. To rouse the Envoy: for rain, invoke the Fire Star; for clear skies, invoke the Water Star—this is the principle of yin-yang excitation and clash.

After use, apply the Four Dipper [substances] to the mouths of the Four Celestial Quarters, circling seven times and inscribing into the Envoy’s talisman:

*By the axe, split the Demon-Quelling Star—*
**Seize and subdue!**

**Zi-Wu Dipper:**
*Heavenly King Kāśyapa’s Thunderbolt—*
**Seize!**

**Wu-Zi Dipper:**
*Heaven-Shattering, Earth-Rending, Ink-Black—*
**Seize!**

**Xu-Chen Dipper:**
*Most High’s Heaven-Splitting Thunderbolt—*
**Seize!**

**Chen-Xu Dipper:**
*Eastern Well’s Flood—*

The Master said: In the steadfastness of steadfastness, one may discourse on the Eastern Well. In the stillness of stillness, one may expound upon the Yellow River.

Now, within the human body, from below the mud-pill palace, at the convergence of the twelve meridians—this is the source of the twelve rivers. Three inches below the navel lies the lower cinnabar field. The spirit ascends to the mud-pill, while that which descends to moisten is none other than the waters of the Yellow River, meeting at the gallbladder palace of the Eastern Well. Extending to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, the exhalations *xu*, *he*, *xi*, *chui*, and *hu* constitute the five phases, engendering true qi.

Within the heart, the true fire circulates; within the kidneys, the true water circulates—both arise from the inner transformations of this body. The numinous terrace, vast and empty, embraces heaven and earth, such that all before one is but the transformation of this heart.

When the great yang heart-fire descends and the kidney-water ascends, the fluids naturally flow and circulate, filling the mouth with sweet, fragrant nectar—this is the so-called sweet dew, the yellow blossom, the upper pool’s water, the flowing true fragrance of the flower pool’s transformations.

Turn the Four Seas—let the Four Seas talismans follow their proper methods.

When ascending the altar, place the Four Seas vats at the four corners of the platform to embody the Four Seas. Arrange the Four Images, completing the rites of offering and propriety, and cast the talismans into the vats to manifest the transformations of creation. Wield the Dragon-Whip to rouse its might, envisioning the four vats as the vastness of rivers, lakes, the Huai, and the sea—where fish and dragons gather, boundless and without shore. When the master employs the Dragon-Whip method to cast the talismans, in an instant the waters surge, heaven and earth darken, and thunderous rain pours forth. Outer phenomena and inner visions alike conform to this, for all arises from this single heart. Yet the adept must not cling to this form; rather, act in accordance with the method and the moment.

**Boiling the Sea: Dragon-Summoning Talisman**
*Oral formula for invocation, Heavenly Thunder Incantation*
Enter the Five Designations:
- Five Thunders
- Four Seas
- Three Marshals (or their envoys may also suffice)

With heart-fire, inscribe and summon the fire-qi to boil the waters, stirring the Three Marshals into motion. As moonlight surges and fire blazes, envision heaven and earth plunged into darkness. After wielding the Dragon-Whip and invoking the Five Designations, recite:

**Right: Wooden Youth Incantation**
Trace a pointed circle, its application transmitted orally. Envision waters surging and fire blazing, the Five Thunders and Three Marshals each riding dragons into the heavens and diving into the seas to bring forth rain.

**Dragon-Whip Method**
*(Text corrupted, five characters missing)*

For borrowing waters from deep pools, use an iron plaque inscribed with the Envoy Talisman in swallow’s blood mixed with realgar and cinnabar. Apply the Five Designations to the talisman and cast it into the pool or cavern—thunder and rain will respond immediately.

**Summoning Thunder: Incantation for Striking the Thunder Bowl**
Inscribe the characters *Yi* (翼) and *Zhen* (轸), arranging the *qi* of *Gen* (艮) and *Xun* (巽) between them.

*Incantation:*
Summon the thunderclaps, let lightning intertwine and soar.
Marshal of Sudden Fire, Five Great Thunder Deities,
Yin-Yang Thunder Chiefs, heed and obey.
With the divine brush, sudden fire; with the thunder hammer, swift arise.
Hasten the thunderclaps, act with fiery urgency.

**Three Turns of the Big Dipper, Step by Step, Kicking Upward**
Recite the preceding incantation, first striking the bowl. Rise from the left *Yi*, gaze toward the right *Zhen*. Overturn a basin to cover the ground, face east, and pace the Dipper’s steps from afar. Turn to the west, recite the incantation, and strike the bowl with the axe. Kick upward with the left foot—thunder will arrive at once.

The axe weighs sixteen *jin*, inscribed on a *jiazi* day with the Azure Dragon Incantation, one *chi* and two *cun* in length. It is forged on a *bingzi* day.

*Incantation:*

Nine Heavens’ Edict Command,
sternly harness the scaled steeds.
Six Dragons and Nine Shameful Ones—
the thunder’s decree admits no kinship.
Blood-sworn pacts replace oaths,
vows offered to the spirits.
Sever venom, topple shrines,
reveal the Dao and illumine the True.
Grasp the halberd, wield the halberd,
cleave the waters and sever the whale.
At times light as dust in the void,
at times heavy as a thousand *jin* of iron;
when white, white as snow in the heavens,
when red, red as the blood of the gibbon.

Great Thunder, Second Thunder, Third Thunder,
Fourth Thunder, Fifth Thunder.
All as decreed by the Jade Purity True King’s statutes.
*Ku* □ swiftly descend with lightning’s grasp.

With each clap, recite once.
For the right talisman, recite once per character written.
Once the talisman is complete, recite the *Edict Command Thunder Incantation* five times, then lift the brush with all force upward.
Employ the Five Thunders Mudra: from *Hai* to *Si*, infuse *qi* from *Gen* and *Xun*.

The master says: The Thunder-Sudden Fire Lord governs this method. Sudden Fire commands the Five Thunder Spirits to assist, while the messenger oversees them—essentially, the Three Marshals are one.

**On the Mechanism of the Method**
For all prayers, offer incense at the altar’s five directions. Fierce fire stirs wrath to summon and dispatch the Thunder Spirit Messengers.
Whether through wrathful *qi*, laughter, or alchemical refinement—
whether dousing the Eastern Well, churning the Four Seas,
beating drums to call thunder, galloping steeds to rouse dragons,
igniting firecrackers to activate talismans, flipping incense to break commands,
erecting altars near water, borrowing *qi* to gather clouds,
petitioning dragons by boiling the sea, or harnessing wind to drive rain—
all cause spirits to follow the turning of the mechanism.

The master says: Beating drums to call thunder or igniting firecrackers to activate talismans—these stir courage.
Erecting altars near water or borrowing *qi* to gather clouds—these leverage circumstance.

**On Mutual Dependence**
The messenger cannot lack the Supreme Unity; the Supreme Unity cannot lack the messenger.
If they are the messenger, you are the Supreme Unity.
If they are dispatched by me, I am their master—thus, the messenger and I cannot be without each other.
To my left is Thunder, to my right is Lightning; opening summons, closing gathers. The messenger never departs from me.
Because they cannot be separated, mutual dependence exists.

**Method for Summoning Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain**
With the gaze, inscribe the *Xu* character in the left palm. Rub both hands together until scorching hot, visualize a sphere of golden light in the palms, then sweep it before the face and inscribe the character in the void.
Imagine the golden radiance within the light. Form the Eight Trigrams with both hands, return to the *Zi* script’s configuration, assume a wrathful stance, and recite the eight characters: *Luo xian ye li zha bo hong su*.
Continuously rub the hands without pause, drawing the Five Affairs to the altar, and recite the sixteen-character incantation while rubbing.

**Method for Raising Wind**
Visualize in the *Xun* direction’s black clouds a ghost with a green face, turban, and robe, a great general holding a tiger-skin wind bag, riding a blue-green dragon.
Next, visualize the ancestral *qi* entering the liver in three coils, transforming into the □□ characters in golden hue.
Exhale the *Xu* and *Xi* breaths through the *Xun* gate, merging with the general’s cyan and red *qi*.
Focus the gaze and recite: *Om chi zha ti dang zui she*.
Without ceasing, chant the *Xu* and *Xi* breaths in unison, visualize the red and cyan morning’s two signs, imagine the sleeves as wind bags, and wave them to draw forth an unbroken stream.
Also recite the sixteen-character incantation and command: *Xia ya shang Feng Yi, swiftly arise!*
After the incantation, declare: *Great Thunder Wind General, swiftly descend!*

**Gathering Clouds to Obscure the Sun**
The master says: Once external matters are complete, press the tongue to the upper palate, first inscribe the *Liao* character, and swallow it into the heart’s palace. Visualize the heart’s Dipper kicking to churn the kidney’s water.
Next, use the heart’s fire to inscribe the sun’s sign in the Flower Pool, then the moon’s sign, as luminous as the sun.
Visualize the kidney’s water surging like a tide, filling the Flower Pool to submerge the sun’s sign. With the Red Dragon, stir the water to overflow, submerging the moon’s sign.
Inhale the water from the previously used vessel, gather the working in the mouth, and spray it to instantly darken the sky.
This is the workings of creation, transmitted orally, never committed to paper or brush. Fearing its loss over time, it is recorded here.

If using a vat or jar, proceed then to summon the five elements of wind and clouds.

**Summoning Clouds and Turning the Mechanism**
The master sits in silent meditation, circulating black clouds dense and dark from the Xun direction. Only then does he open his eyes, and clouds naturally arise.
He further circulates the deepest blackness from both kidneys, transforming it into a vast sea where wind and waves surge. With a single exhalation of lung *qi*, waves from both kidneys arise, descending to the depths of the great sea. There, he perceives a three-legged *neng*, its mouth spewing black clouds that ascend along the spine to the Heavenly Gate, billowing outward. He then employs the *Tuanmo* method.

**The Concealing Sun Formula**
The master recites the Jade Emperor’s *Gao*, inscribing the sign ☩ with divine radiance, merging it with the creative workings of wind and clouds.
Upon completing the Jade Emperor’s *Gao*, he again applies his own creative power: pressing the tongue to the upper palate, he inscribes this sign and exhales it into the water vessel.
After reciting the incantation, he inhales the *qi* of the Celestial Stem, sprays it upon the sun and moon, and instantly darkens them.
He then employs the *qi* of destruction, reciting the *Concealing Three Lights* incantation:
*Taiwei Tongzi, chi.*
*Cheli, svāhā.*
*Oṃ.*
*Rāhu, Ketu, and the Earth Mansion seize.*
*Oṃ.*
*Ni ni hūm hūm.*
*The black-dark sky subdues.*
Reciting this incantation without counting repetitions, he inscribes the preceding sign with his gaze, veiling the sun and moon. Reinforcing it with the spraying method, he waits until the sunlight dims slightly before applying the *Tuan Yun* method.
Otherwise, the yin *qi* cannot approach the yang.

**The Gathering Clouds Formula**
*Fire, Empyrean Fire.*

**Water Refinement with Water**
First, heat the water vessel over fire until scorching hot. Using a black brush, inscribe the sign of the Sun Lord, then recite:
*Oṃ. Va[kṣa]ra yungna ri svāhā.*
*Yuzhen Li.*
Upon completing the incantation, draw in the *qi* of sunlight and visualize the sun’s radiance.

Next, inscribe the Moon Lord’s name over the Sun Lord’s sign. Recite:
*Oṃ. Va[kṣa]ra ra svāha saha.*
*Jieheng Kan.*
Upon completing the incantation, draw in the *qi* of moonlight and transform it into the moon.

Then, combine the two preceding signs, calling this the "Jia-Yi Sign," and cover it. Next, apply the *Great Gathering Clouds* talisman atop it, reciting the *Gathering Clouds* incantation while anointing it. Finally, perform the *Rubbing Palms* method.

**Rubbing Palms Formula**
The master forms the *Sword Mudra*, inscribing the character *bi* (毕) on the left palm with the right hand, then circulates kidney-water *qi* and blows upon it. Next, inscribe the character *jiao* (角) on the right palm with the left hand, drawing heart-fire *qi* and exhaling upon it. Then, rub both palms together until they grow as hot as fire, thrust them into the water vessel, inhale the water, and spray it toward the sun while shouting commands to proceed. If no response occurs, employ the *Grasping Wind and Thunder* incantation.

**Rubbing Palms Incantation**
*Ni ni hūm hūm, Black-Dark Great Spirit.*
*Heaven spins, earth turns, sun and moon lose their light.*
*Rāhu and the Earth Mansion, destructive *qi* soars.*
*Heaven and earth darken, east and west indistinguishable.*
*The Three Realms merge into chaos, misty *qi* instantly rises.*
*Thunder cracks the earth, wind and fire rush forth.*
*Oṃ. Urut cha u tut cha, Black-Dark cha.*
*Cha of boundless black-darkness, swiftly as the law commands!*

**Grasping Wind and Thunder Incantation**
*Wind Earl, come! Rain Master, come! Swiftly as fire’s command seizes!*
*One breath, seven repetitions.*

**Thunder Stem**
Starting from the *Gen* position, step rightward through *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Si*, *Wu*, *Shen*, *You*, *Xu*, and *Hai*, then cross from *Qian* to *Xun*. Visualize the eyes emitting lightning and the mouth spouting black clouds, shouting to summon wind and thunder.

**Great Gathering Clouds Talisman**
*Yin-Shen-Si-Hai, Golden Well ten thousand fathoms deep.*
*By imperial decree, open the heavens; by command, split the earth. Lead the thunder soldiers—wind and thunder arrive swiftly!*
*Water and fire merge—swiftly as the Supreme Emperor commands!*
*By the Emperor’s decree, circulate the ancestral *qi* of Golden Light!*

**Eastern Thunder Spirit, hasten!**
**Southern Thunder Spirit, hasten!**
**Western Thunder Spirit, hasten!**
**Northern Thunder Spirit, hasten!**
**Central Thunder Spirit, hasten!**

Recite the following incantation while anointing:
*Imperial Decree Incantation.*

**The Celestial Emperor’s Edict of Empowerment**

By the Celestial Emperor’s bestowed authority, I am commanded to command thunder and lightning.
When the brush opens, clouds and *qi* arise; when the brush closes, clouds and *qi* converge.
The Five Peaks tremble, the Four Seas overturn.
Dragons ascend the deep, ten thousand *li* of yin clouds gather.
Clouds must not scatter; winds must not cease.
Clouds fill the Eight Extremities, dense mists shroud the Four Heavens.
Thick rain congeals, transforming into sweet dew.
Swiftly, swiftly, seize and bind!

**Dispersing Clouds Formula**
Gaze with focused intent upon the Primordial Palace, envisioning within the radiant golden light a □ character, vast as a great citrus.
Gently straighten the spine.
With □, draw upward from the *jiājí* to the crown, then through the Celestial Eye’s golden light, burst forth to cleave the black clouds.

**Severing the Rainbow Formula**
Left hand in Jade Seal, right hand in Sword Seal, circulate the transformative power, form the □ character, ascending from the *jiājí* to the Celestial Eye, then strike upward through the rainbow.
Silently recite:
*Tiān hōng, true spirits, Xī zhēn, Sè yīng.*
*Lì niè mò liè, hù nù yǒng yīn.*
*Zòu zhēng yán dàn, zhàng měng fēi lún.*
*Divine might shakes and strikes, by decree sever the demonic husk.*
*Divine might spans the Three Realms—hasten to execute!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

Upon completing the incantation, draw *qi* from the *gāng* and blow upon the Sword Seal. At the *wèi* position, slash upward while shouting to the Celestial Generals to sever the demonic rainbow, then blow the Primordial Uniting *Gāng Qi* upon it.

**Alternative Method**
When a rainbow obstructs the rain, the ritual master prepares five-colored threads, each one foot and five inches long. Stand in the left Thunder Formation, step the Killing and Subduing *Gāng*, and visualize the rainbow serpent absorbed onto the five-colored threads. Have a youth pull the threads while the master summons the generals, steps the Thunder-Fire *Gāng*, and brandishes the sword to sever it.
If unresponsive, take a blade of grass, grasp both ends firmly in the hands, and bite through it—this will ensure immediate efficacy.

**Four Seas Black Water Talisman**
*Sun, moon, and stars—thunder dwells in the hall of lightning.*
*The True King’s decree uproots your calamity.*
*The Celestial Emperor’s command instantly summons concealment and movement.*
*Summon clouds, spew mist—thunder and rain traverse the Four Crossroads.*
*Flying sand and hurtling stones, dancing thunder and roaring lightning.*
*Steaming rain flows through the Four Seas and Four Abysses.*
*The Four Darknesses receive the command—vast and boundless!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

Inscribe with ink ground in egg white, then immerse in water. First, blow upon it. Grind the ink with Persian *jiā*, recite the Thunder Sutra eighty-one times, and vigorously wash the ink in eight pools of water while intoning:
*Heaven black, earth black, the Yellow River black.*
*At hài, zǐ, chǒu—ten thousand *li* of mountains and rivers black as ink.*
*At yín, mǎo, chén—wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning swiftly surge.*
*At sì, wǔ, wèi—black dragons, dark as ink and lacquer.*
*At shēn, yǒu—clouds, thunder, wind, and rain fill the vast sky.*
*Great Black Celestial Spirits—hasten!*
*Xū shēn.*

Upon completing the incantation, visualize the kidneys as black, then blow forth the Golden *Qi*—instant response will follow.

**Suppressing the Southern Wind, Obscuring Sun and Stars: Supreme Unity Black Talisman**

**Supreme Unity Linked Talismans Incantation**

*Six Dīng, Six Jiǎ, hasten to descend!*
*By the decree of the Jade Emperor of Vast Heaven.*
*Summon the Thunder Department’s Divine Marshal Liú Shèngguāng to obscure the sun, raise clouds, and swiftly suppress the southern wind!*

Inscribe on a new brick, ensuring no one sees it, then bury it at the *kūn* position—by that day, the light will vanish, and the southern wind will be halted.

**Suppressing the Southern Wind Incantation**
*Kuí commands the aligned peaks—*
*winds cease at the gèn corner.*
*Dare they disobey?*
*Then dispatch the Celestial Executioner!*
*Reverently summon the character Liú to obscure the sunlight and suppress the southern wind, swiftly raising clouds!*
*Swiftly!*

With the Sword Seal, burn the *Hé Qì* Talisman in a water vessel, then face the sun and spray water, reciting the incantation once per spray, seven times in total.

**Five Thunders Converging Qi Talisman**
Five Thunders, Thunder Lords,
Four Sages, Wind Earls,
Three Lights, Starry Dipper,
Two Dragons stir and clash.
One True Primordial Sovereign,
Liú Shèngguāng, Liú Bèi—
*Swiftly, swiftly, hasten to arrive!*

Yang essence, yin spirit,
Six Jiǎ, Six Dīng,
Water and Fire’s dual *qi*,
linked to form the embryonic shape.
Yang essence, firelight—
true *qi* swiftly awakens.
Enter my grasp—
delay not!
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

**Obscuring Sunlight Incantation**
*Lock the Celestial Gate, seal the Earthly Portal,*
*leave the Human Door open, block the Ghost Road.*
*The sun dims, the moon darkens,*
*thunder and lightning arrive, the Wind Earl deploys.*
*Ghosts and spirits grieve, their forms self-destruct.*
*By Kōngtóng’s command, the Six Dīng seize them.*
*Summon the Dīng—hasten, hasten, hasten!*

**Thunder Essence Talisman**
Upon completing the talisman, focus the gaze, step into the talisman’s formation, and swiftly inscribe the True King’s taboo name.
Imprint the character *huán* upon the talisman’s center, then blow the ancestral *qi* into it, uniting with the spirit. Visualize the talisman’s messenger, then beneath the feet, within the Thunder character, repeatedly inscribe the nine characters: *fēn, gài, dū, gǔ, líng, kē, líng, wù, dài*.
Silently recite the Nine Heavens’ titles, the Nine Cycles, then from the *kǎn* position, lift the brush and swallow the saliva.
Again, upon the Thunder character, inscribe □, imprint the *nǜ* character, circulate the heart’s fire downward, and raise the kidneys’ water. Envision the sea’s black *qi* enveloping the red *qi*, coalescing into the *nǜ* character, then blow it forth to merge with the title as black clouds surge.
From this, clouds and *qi* steam and swell, rain filling heaven and earth.
Continue reciting the Nine Titles, Nine Cycles, then from the *kǎn* position, lift the brush and recite the *Bōzhā* incantation, dispatching as prescribed.
If no response occurs, summon, circulate, and inscribe the talisman, invoking the general and the title, following the prior method.
Upon completion, inscribe the *guà* □ before the talisman, imprinting the *xiōng* title upon the chest.
Then, within the Thunder character at the talisman’s base, inscribe the *guà* □, imprinting the *xuǎn* title. From the talisman’s base, drag the brush upward to the hand, then with utmost force, sweep a path of fire downward as swiftly as the wind, kicking open a rainway. Draw the ancestral *qi* and blow it within—this is the wondrous inversion of function.
Dispatch as before with the incantation. When summoning thunder and inscribing talismans, clench the teeth, hold the breath, and silently recite: *Ǒm niè □□□*, without counting the repetitions.

**Refining the Spirit**
Each night, sit upright, regulate the breath, concentrate the spirit, click the teeth, and close the eyes. Allow the divine light to naturally focus upon the Spirit Terrace, where the two *qi* spontaneously unite, forming a □ character of golden hue within. The heart and abdomen will feel aflame, enveloped in golden light, as if cinnabar.

Within the profound obscurity, behold the messenger—focus the intent unwaveringly, stilling all thoughts. When practicing, merely glance with heart and eyes toward the messenger, then raise and strike forth from the Thunder Gate, merging with the Celestial Gate’s messenger as one. Use at will, yet never lightly disclose; guard this secret most closely.

**Ancestral *Qi* Entering the Talisman**
Visualize the heart’s *qi* descending as kidney water ascends, the two *qi* uniting. With the □ character, draw them upward from the double passes of the spine, rolling forth from the mouth, then infuse this character into the talisman.

**Hastening Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain**
If clouds have not risen or rain has not come, envision heart-fire descending into kidney water, forming a purple-gold hue. From between the brows, emit this 矿 character, hold the breath, and spray water toward the desired direction. Again visualize the 矿 character within the water, then employ the eight-character incantation to hasten.

**Drawing Water from the Celestial River**
Visualize the □ character beside the sixth star of the Southern Dipper, where a small star radiates golden light, descending into the Dipper’s mouth. Envision your body’s white *qi* in primordial chaos, ascending to meet the Celestial River’s golden light. Once the white *qi* is pierced by the golden light’s *qi*, behold the messenger. Then channel the waters of Caoxi, rising from the coccyx to Kunlun, reversing upward into the Celestial River. With a single spray, infuse the talisman, then swiftly flick the brush twice to animate it.

**Secret Characters**
□咦□□喝摄六咄□呢□呵五轰一。

**Efficacious Talisman**
**Five *Qi* Spirit Turtle**
One auspicious, two fitting—gather and restrain the wayless drought demons, rebellious ghosts, and lawless drought fiends.
*Ǒm vā □ ra yung □ □ li svāhā*
*Ǒm □ □ ra □ ra svāha*
*Ǒm hūm li svā yung ta hā*

**Five Directions, Five Thunder Messengers—Swiftly Descend with Five *Qi***
Thunderbolt golden light, swiftly manifest!
*Chén xū dǒu tiān huáng jiāyē pīlì shè xū chén dǒu Ǒm hūm hūm, all spirits bow! May deviant demons submit and return to rectitude. Whoever dares disobey shall be reduced to dust—hasten as the law commands!*

**Nine-Tailed Fox Pressing the Nine Provinces**
Mouth spewing black *qi*, the 聻 character—whenever employed, draw the Great Yin’s *qi* and blend it with kidney *qi* into the talisman to summon clouds, bring rain, or obscure the sun. Inscribe on red paper in black ink or on black paper with chicken’s blood.

**Incantation**
Spirits of the northern *rén guǐ*,
Great Fire Bell of the southern sky.
Roaring, charging thunder and lightning,
Breathing forth clouds and rain.
Revolving wind, congealing water and fire,
Thunderbolts born within the palm.
Shaking and shattering Kunlun’s pillars,
The river’s source surges through the four seas.
Yan Bo topples mountains and peaks,
A hundred rivers’ rain falls like ropes.
Misty vapors condense water and fire,
Pouring and pooling to fill all directions.
Disobey not my command,
Report above to the Four Spirits.
Whoever defies my decree
Shall meet the fate of those who rebel against Supreme Clarity.
The Celestial Emperor shall annihilate your body,
Wind blades sever your form.
Hasten as the Purple Tenuity’s Great Emperor decrees!

Recite the incantation, visualizing the five directions’ five thunders descending with five *qi* into the talisman. Next, summon the Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities and thunder spirits to assist the Five Thunder Generals. Tread upon the waterlogged regions, and wind, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain shall erupt simultaneously.

**Method**
First, lift the *yǒu* character, beholding within the western Great Yin a 聻 character, round and luminous as the full moon on the fifteenth night. Inhale this golden *qi* along with moonlight into the lung meridian. Then swallow it down to the kidney palace, merging with the 聻 character, surging to ignite heart-fire. Again, inscribe the three characters 莫□行 in empty space. Draw in with the nose, absorb with the mouth, swallow into the heart meridian, stirring and rolling forth to obscure the sun and summon rain. Visualize this entering the efficacious talisman. When burning the talisman, perform likewise.

**Alternative Method**
**Horizontal Heaven Earl’s Edict**
**Han Minister’s Law of Rotation**
**True Thunder Yuan Bo’s Command**
Visualize the talisman as a three-legged fox in the southern palace, stirring waves, churning the sea, summoning thunder, and invoking rain.

**Incantation**
Thunder’s wrath, Heaven’s might,
Breaching the Celestial Pool.
Mysterious Gate’s great abundance,
Dual luminaries, six instruments.
Clouds move, rain descends,
Thunder cracks, wind races.
*Shā zhà hōng zhà, □ zhà lī zhà.*
Upon reaching the true position,
None dare defy the true.
Hasten as the law commands!

**Heavenly Attendants, Radiant Fragrance,**
**Azure Toad, Purple Crow.**
Water above, fire below,
Merging and soaking.
Thunder and lightning follow the summons,
Wind and rain answer the call.
*Yèchā* strike stone,
The nine lands flourish.
*Axiāng* rides the steed,
Raising thunder, invoking rain.
*Chī hōng shā zhà lī.*
Hasten as the law commands!

**Jade Decree Talisman**
**Incantation**

**Jade Decree of the Supreme Emperor,**
Proclaimed to the myriad thunder deities—
Hearken swiftly and act!
Dispatch and command thunder and lightning,
Spread vast winds and clouds,
Bestow sweet rains universally,
Sweep away yin’s obscuring veils,
Greatly succor all living beings.
The Jade Decree commands with urgency—
Execute at once!
*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the Jade Decree and Law of the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heaven!*

The right-hand Jade Emperor Seal:
Inscribe in cinnabar upon iron leaves,
Cast into a water urn.
Or write in cinnabar on yellow paper,
Burn toward the void—
Summon the thunder deities,
And none shall disobey.
This talisman is the Supreme Emperor’s Decree;
Burn it together with the command talisman,
And the decree shall be executed.

*Fǎhǎi Yízhū*, Scroll Seven, concludes.

**#1 Esoteric Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence Envoys: The Divine Mechanism of Mystic Qi Concealment—Transmission of the Divine Empyrean’s Vibrant Methods.**
As recorded in *Dàofǎ Huìyuán*, Scrolls 83–87, *The Esoteric Scripture of Primordial Thunder Essence* states that this lineage was founded by the Azure Flower Emperor Lord Lǐ Yà, Fire Master Wāng Shǒuzhēn, and Attendant of the Celestial Throne Wáng Wénqīng. Later patriarchs include Bái Yùchán, Jīn Zhìyuǎn, Chén Zhòngjì, Zhào Zǐlín, and Mǐn Zǐwén.

*Fǎhǎi Yízhū*, Scroll Eight: *Esoteric Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Essence Envoys: The Divine Mechanism of Mystic Qi Concealment.*

**Methods for Summoning Thunder and Transforming Creation**

Establish the Five Phases’ mutual conquest as the signal. The head aligns with the *Kan* palace, while the inception arises from the gallbladder palace. Then recite the incantation *Jīn Guāng Chè Diàn Zhà* ("Golden Light Pierces the Lightning Roar"), repeating the five characters without counting the iterations.

**Mechanism:**
The right signal emerges from the kidneys, passes through the five sense organs, and enters the sea of *qi*. A great thunderclap resounds, traversing the thirty-six barriers before bursting forth from the crown. The Five Thunders erupt in full force.

**Inscribing the Golden Light in the *Xun* Palace**
**Summoning Thunder: Oral Formula**
The master observes: "The moon constantly conjoins *Xu* (11th Earthly Branch). Determine where the Celestial Pivot (*Tian’gang*) resides, face that direction, and visualize the Northern Dipper."

Next, form the sword mudra and inscribe the character *lào* (炓) toward the Dipper’s mouth, imagining it flashing brilliantly. Visualize a strand of golden light surging from the glabella, shooting directly into that direction. With fury, inhale this character and guide it into the talisman with the sword mudra.

At this moment:
- If the Celestial Pivot is in *Mao* (4th Branch), thunder arises.
- If in *Si* (6th), wind.
- If in *Wu* (7th), lightning.
- If in *Zi* (1st), rain.
- If in *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, or *Wei* (5th, 11th, 2nd, 8th), clouds.

**Redirecting Thunder**
If thunder resounds in the east, visualize the Northern Dipper fixed above. Use the sword mudra to inscribe *lào* at the Dipper’s mouth, then imagine golden light from the cinnabar field bursting from the celestial heart and shooting upward. With the sword mudra, guide it to another location to redirect the thunder’s response.

**Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng Drives Thunder**
Visualize the Nine *Qi* converging at the center, coalescing into a blue lotus seed. Suddenly, it splits open, revealing Marshal Tianpeng standing within, a single-horned *qiu* dragon at his right. Recite the command thrice, and the dragon roars while the marshal rages. The adept, likewise enraged, dispatches them to hasten the thunder envoys and command the myriad thunders.

**The Blue Lotus Seed Contains Creation**
**Lightning-Commanding Mudra**
Virtually inscribe the character *□* in the right palm and *□* in the left. Rub the palms together until scorching hot, then visualize a golden light orb within. Next, imagine a golden *lào* character suspended in the clouds ahead.

The adept flicks the palms’ signal, transmuting it into a golden fire-star. With both palms facing outward, shoot the golden light—electrical radiance blazes, illuminating the vast sky.

Recite:
*"Chaos of heaven and sea-mountains, lightning streams forth in brilliance—divine mechanism seizes!*
*Golden light wrenches the lightning roar!*
*Command: Cloud-lightning, swiftly arise!"*

Upon concluding the incantation, visualize two strands of golden light from the palms shooting toward the star, drawing forth the lightning’s surge.

**Seal this method; do not neglect it.**

**Method for Praying for Snow**
The master instructs: To invoke snow, conceal the moon and gather the Five Stars at the Eastern Well (*Dongjing*). Auspicious *qi* will flow abundantly—this is called "assembling the Five Phases and harmonizing the Four Symbols." When the *dui*-harmony and *zhao*-harmony converge, auspicious *qi* arrives.

Add the character *du* (朒) beneath the talisman and overlay it with the Five Stars. Visualize the Great Yin (*Taiyin*) at the zenith, imagining the brush as the original star. The four remaining stars coalesce into auspicious *qi* and harmonious *qi*, suffusing mountains, rivers, and the Six Directions. The Six Flowers scatter and disperse, drifting across heaven and earth.

Then wield the brush and recite:
*"Flying heaven’s sudden fire, revolving the eastern numen!*
*High ministers and immortal lords, auspicious light gathers and congeals!*
*Stiff winds shear water, transforming into jade forests!*
*The Six Directions dispel calamity; the hundred grains receive essence!*
*Majestic light rectifies the order; heaven and earth grow solemn and clear!*
*True kings spread transformation; divine marvels adorn the Jade Capital!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Great Yin Moon Emperor’s decree commands!*

Upon concluding the incantation, extend the brush toward the designated direction.

**Secret Principles of Opening and Closing**
- *Qian* (Heaven Gate)
- *Kan* (Rain Cavern)
- *Gen* (Ghost Path)
- *Zhen* (Thunder Cavern)
- *Xun* (Earth Door, Wind Cavern)
- *Li* (Fire Cavern)
- *Kun* (Human Gate)
- *Dui* (Marshal)

**Correspondences:**
- Wind (Wood)
- Clouds (Earth)
- Thunder (Wood)
- Lightning (Fire)
- Rain (Water)
- Hail (Metal)
- Frost (Metal)
- Snow (Water)

These methods all pertain to the Five Phases, each governed by the cycle of generation and conquest. Generation brings completion; conquest brings destruction. Employ generation while avoiding conquest; employ conquest while avoiding generation. Thus, summoning wind and raising thunder—transformative marvels—never depart from the Five Phases.

**Raising Wind:**
Tread open the wind cavern, seal the rain cavern, and firmly tread the cloud cavern—then the wind arises.

**Stilling Wind:**
Tread open the rain path, sever the wind path with the sword mudra, and seal the wind cavern to gather the wind.

**Summoning Thunder:**
Sever the wind path, seal the rain gate, open the cloud path to raise clouds, then kick open the thunder aperture—thunder resounds.

**Dispersing Thunder:**
Open the wind path, seal the cloud path, close the thunder aperture, and the thunder disperses.

**Raising Clouds:**
Kick open the rain path, kick the wind cavern, and open the cloud cavern—clouds arise.

**Dispersing Clouds:**
Open the wind path, seal the cloud cavern, and open the fire cavern.

**Praying for Rain:**
Open the cloud cavern, wind cavern, rain cavern, and thunder cavern. If wind, clouds, and thunder are present, seal the wind cavern, then close the thunder cavern while fully opening the rain cavern—rain will arise.

**Ceasing Rain:**
Open the wind cavern and fire cavern, dispersing the cloud cavern—rain will naturally cease.

**Memorializing Affairs:**
- Open the Heaven Gate to shift inauspicious stars.
- Open the Heaven Gate to extinguish fire calamities.

**Opening the Heaven Gate**
**Refinement and Salvation:**
Open the Earth Door to treat illness.

**Opening the Human Gate**
**Treating Possession:**
Open the Ghost Path to capture malevolent spirits.

**Sealing the Ghost Path**
**Severing Demonic Influence:**
Block the Ghost Path.

**Threefold Command of the Celestial Pivot**
- **Celestial Pivot for Praying for Rain:** *Shen*, *Zi*, *Chen* (9th, 1st, 5th Branches)
- **Treating Illness:** *Hai*, *Mao*, *Wei* (12th, 4th, 8th)
- **Praying for Clear Skies:** *Yin*, *Wu*, *Xu* (3rd, 7th, 11th)
- **Punitive Expeditions:** *Si*, *You*, *Chou* (6th, 10th, 2nd)

**Master’s Secrets**
Wind has caverns; clouds have chambers.
- **Wind Cavern:** Align breath and *qi*, attuning to the *Xun* door corresponding to the western season—this must not be unknown.
- **Cloud Chamber:** Clouds conceal within mountains and peaks. Through *Dui* Metal conquering Wood, sharp edges stir mist, forming clouds and fog.

**Iron Talisman**
Once the talisman is completed, further imbue it with the flickering radiance of sunlight. The *Wu* (7th) and *Yue* (Moon) cycles ensure boundless efficacy.

**Child (Zi) Incantation**
By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I hereby summon the Thunder Gods.
At *Wu* (7th), clouds surge and lightning sweeps; at *Wu*, wind and fire intertwine.
At *Mao* (4th), obey my talismanic decree; at *Chou* (2nd), fire swiftly illuminates.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Jade Pure Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees!*

The talisman is to be inscribed on an iron plaque, three *cun* and six *fen* in width, nine *cun* in length. Face east, visualize the ancestral masters and marshals in the void, then inscribe the talisman in cinnabar.

**Post-Talisman Invocation**
*Thunder Bureau Proclamation:*
To the Dragon Wells, Twelve Streams, and all river deities of [such-and-such] locale: You are commanded to heed the Supreme Talisman’s decree, rouse the dragons to bring rain, and refrain from unleashing violent winds that harm all beings.

This direction’s executioner *qi* aligns with Heaven’s mechanism.
With flying *Gang* and grasped mudras, burn the talisman and decree,
Awaiting the thunder’s clap to follow.

Face this direction when burning the talisman to draw the executioner *qi*. Visualize yourself as the Celestial Pivot (*Tian Gang*) to summon and dispatch thunder, directing it toward this quarter.
*For example, on a Jia day, draw the qi from the opposite direction.*
The rest follow accordingly.

**Stepping the Gang and Plucking the Dipper**
Step with the feet, pluck with the hands.

First, compose the mind and stabilize the spirit. Burn incense and invoke the Ancestral Master, Jade Pure Infinite Venerable August Heaven Jade Emperor. Visualize the spirit in audience, draw a mouthful of yellow qi, and let golden light interpenetrate the body.

Next, trace the two Dipper stars, breaking 巽 to open 乾, reciting:
*"Heavenly Sovereign Gaya Thunderclap Seize—*
*Chen and Xu Dipper strike open the 巽 trigram."*

Then trace the Thunderclap Golden Light swiftly manifesting form, with Xu and Chen Dipper striking open the 乾 trigram.

After tracing the Dipper, again draw golden light qi, absorb it into the ancestral palace, form a □ character, and emit it above 巽.

Next, arrange the Jade Emperor’s formation and recite the incantation to summon the envoy, who emerges from the earth amid black clouds. The divine person gradually grows vast, a hundred rods in height, his body wreathed in firelight, wielding a jade staff in the form of swift-fire.

Then rub the kidneys and recite the three-character incantation *yaya □*, emitting one’s own 坎 qi to merge with the envoy. Draw a mouthful of central yellow qi and blow it forth to envelop the envoy, who stands before the altar awaiting commands.

**Prayer for Rain: Ritual for Writing Talismans**
First, write the character *xuǎn* (晅) behind the right eye,
then draw in the qi of the Great Yang,

exhale this qi from the talisman’s mouth.
Then silently recite the incantation:
*Oṃ hūng yung da-lī svāhā.*

After reciting the incantation,
write the four characters *bì bǐ bì □* (□) on the talisman’s body.

flowing into the talisman,
while the black qi from the kidneys surges upward to the spleen palace.

press the left hand into the Thunder Seal,
and draw qi from the two kidney halls,
channeling it upward to the ears and into the talisman.
Gaze at the single character □ in the talisman’s mouth,
visualize the ancestral qi entering the talisman,

illuminating heaven and earth.

Then silently recite the incantation:

inscribing it over the talisman’s *chi* (勑) character.
For rain prayers, use the character □ (*huī*, “radiance”);
for clear skies, use □ (*huà*, “cleaving”);
for exorcism, use □ (*pēng*, “boiling”).
Inhale the sound of □ (*hè*, “shout”),
drawing in the □ sound (*hē*, “breath”),
and visualize riding wind and thunder as it departs.

Finally, recite the dispatching incantation:
*Oṃ hūng hūng bha-bha ga tsa ma shèng jí-lì.*
“By ordinance, let it be executed.
Swiftly unfold wind and clouds,
greatly manifest retribution.
Hasten, hasten, as the ordinance commands!”

After reciting the incantation, burn the talisman and dispatch the messenger.

Prepare an official document summoning the local Dragon King to bring rain on a specified day, then have someone cast it into the deep.

**Talisman Design**

Severing the Rainbow
To sever a rainbow, first assume the *zuo lei* stance, grasp your sword in the right hand, and slash toward the rainbow with a single stroke—or wave your sleeve once to dispel it.

*By the Axe-Cleaving of the Stalwart Star’s Celestial Execution Decree.*
*Decree the Execution of the Celestial Stalwart, Cleave with the Axe.*

Left and right, *zi* and *wu*,
Recite again:
*"The divine scroll coils like a dragon’s head,
Heavenly demons wither of themselves.
Seated in the Great Luo,
Laughing and chanting in unison."*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances of the Most High.*

Take a single stalk of thatch, face upward to draw in the *qi* of the Stalwart Star, and blow upon the thatch. Recite the *Tianpeng* incantation three times, then snap the thatch with a strike, recite three more times, and strike with the Dipper mudra—the rainbow will vanish.

**Great Black Thunderbolt Talisman**
Also called the *Nine Fires Nine Waters Talisman*

*By the Decree of the Radiant Emperor of Li-Yi, the Roaring Command of Dongjiong*
*The Thunder Bureau of Zhen wields lightning, summoning thunder and sparks*
*Thunderbolts shatter stone, springs flow free*
*All demonic forces across the Three Realms are obliterated without trace*
*The Great Black Northern Waters surge across the Four Seas*
*Every malevolent spirit is annihilated in form*

*Thunder Duke commands with authority on the left, issues decrees on the right*
*The Green Net’s Fourfold Weave—Chart of Thunder and Fire*
*By the Nine, Three, and Five Qi, dispatch the marshals to lash the winds, fly the flames, and seize lightning to exterminate demonic traces*
*Seven and Nine take flight, transforming into vast oceans, patrolling the four directions to inspect ghostly encampments*

On yang days, employ the *Great Black Flying Fire* to darkly illuminate heaven and earth—first scour the evil ghosts, then sever the roots of calamity.
Black mists stride forth to aid the dragon in summoning rain.
Flying stars and streaming lightning radiate across the four voids, compelling the wailing emperors to drag forth the celestial thunder.
*Heavenly thunder, hasten! Swiftly sound your roar!*

*The Five Directions’ Envoys—thunder and lightning—transform into azure light, manifesting in form to enter my heart. Hasten, swiftly!*

*At noon, absorb the qi of Zhen.*
*Decree and incantation.*

Great Thunder Duke of All-Heavens, your thunderclap shakes the void.
Three hundred thousand troops of blades and arms, sternly harnessed within this talisman.
Should any disobey, your stern decree brooks no delay—
seize them beneath the *Kui-Gang*, transform them into pure, still wind.
Swiftly, swiftly as the thunder’s command under the Celestial Bureau’s law!

**Decree and Incantation:**
Thunder-cave wind-drill, enacting heaven’s majestic might.
To the left, rush the Crimson Path; to the right, command the Dark Tortoise.
Wisdom’s mandate spans the heavens; martial lords hold the jade tally.
Iron walls and purple caverns, slaying metal and water-fire.
Sharp edges lie hidden in abundance—true destiny converges and upholds.
*Pleiades* and *Willow*, the *Demon-Star* lodges—north, south, east, west.
Sun-Valley and Dragon-Terrace, Fire-Mansion and River-Demon.
Under the jade script’s command, hasten this advantage swiftly!
Swiftly, swiftly as the Six Waves’ Heavenly Emperor’s law and decree!

**Five-Thunder Pivot Mechanism: Talisman for Summoning Thunder and Invoking Rain**
When inscribing talismans, employ the day’s own sign, its *Longsheng* (Vital Birth), and the *Guandai* (Capped and Girded) directional formula.
Wood is born in *Hai*, earth-water in *Shen*, metal in *Si*, fire in *Yin*.
*Longsheng* (Vital Birth), *Muyu* (Bathing), *Guandai* (Capped and Girded), *Linguan* (Approaching Office), *Diwang* (Flourishing), *Shuai* (Declining), *Bing* (Sickness), *Si* (Death), *Mu* (Tomb), *Jue* (Extinction), *Tai* (Embryo), *Yang* (Nurturing).
For example, on a *Jiazi* day: *Jiazi* and *Yichou* are *Sea-Metal*—thus metal is born in *Si*; trace the *Si* sign for the first thunder. *Guandai* resides in *Wei*; trace the *Wei* sign for the second thunder. The rest follow accordingly.

**Xuan-Yuan** pinches the day’s palace’s *Longsheng* sign, facing *Xun* to absorb the center’s *qi*.
**Zhou-Zi** pinches the second palace’s *Guandai* sign, facing west to draw in the west’s *qi*.
**Yu-Wang** also pinches the second palace’s *Zi* sign, spreading the north’s *qi* inward.
**Chi-You** pinches the second palace’s *Mao* sign, spreading the east’s *qi* inward.
**Xuan-Yuan** again pinches the *Longsheng* sign, drawing in the south’s *Li* *qi*.

**Decree and Coating Incantation:**
Great Sage Thunder Duke, set heaven’s mechanism in motion.
The sacred power of heaven and earth, the dual forces of sun and moon.

Follow my call, heed my prayers.

*Zhu zhu zhu zhu*, *pan pan pan pan*, *hong hong hong hong*, *wu wu wu wu*, *yan yan yan yan*.

Upon completing the incantation, draw the *sha* *qi* and blow it forth, then add: □□.

**Yin Formula: Vast Obscurity.**

Four vertical, five horizontal—**Huagai** now complete.

Defy my command, and your skull shall shatter, your brains scatter.
*Hasten, hasten, as the law decrees.* □□□□□□□

The **Capital of Heaven**’s mandate arrives—thunder roars, winds rage, lightning strikes as one.
**Xuan-Yuan** employs the **Longsheng** sign, pinching to invoke, drawing in the day’s celestial *qi*, spreading it inward.
The true *qi* of the Five Directions interweaves with the Great Void.

I recite the **Great Cavern’s** martial incantation—hastily, they rush to my altar.
**Kuixing** and **Tiangang**, *hasten, hasten, as the Six Waves’ Heavenly Emperor’s decree commands.*

The sacred power of heaven and earth, the dual forces of sun and moon.
Today’s **Guan** summoning—swiftly descend with clouds and rainbows!
Follow my call, heed my prayers.

Should any spirit turn from me, be reduced to motes of dust.
*I act under the Six Waves’ Heavenly Emperor’s law and decree.*

Once the talisman is complete, draw the **Single Fire Sha** directional *qi* and blow it forth.
Add the Five Emperors’ taboo names, inscribing:
**Xuan** to the east, **Zhong** to the south, **Jin Hu** to the west, **Long Wei** to the north, **Xuan Ling** at the center—*golden radiance qi* enters.
Then add □□ *hong* □ into the talisman.

Recite:

When the incantation is complete, visualize five breaths of black *qi* within the kidneys. Then visualize three breaths of red *qi* within the heart, intertwining, and blow them onto the tile. Next, take two sheets of paper—one red, one black—and inscribe a Dao talisman on each, then burn them in the center. Write the characters *Yi* and *Zhen* on the left and right hands respectively, rubbing them eighty-one times. Visualize wind, clouds, thunder, and rain filling heaven and earth. Recite the Wind-Fire-Mountain incantation once more. Spread both hands wide, spray a mouthful of water, glare fiercely, and hurl the tile talisman toward the direction from which the wind comes—then the thunder and rain shall arrive. If the thunder is slow to rise, inscribe a talisman on blue paper to hasten it.

**Expedient Method for Praying for Rain**
When praying for rain, simply ensure the rain falls. Petition the barbarous thunder, silently memorialize the Supreme Emperor, and at midnight during the *zi* hour, face due east. Prepare an incense table with seasonal fruits, five measures of wine, forty-eight measures of jujube broth, twelve measures of black water, and a basin containing seven black turtles. On a three-inch piece of blue paper, write the *Raising Rain Talisman* in cinnabar, then burn it with the fragrant flame of maple incense while reciting the *Prayer for Rain to the Wooden Lord* eighty-one times—the rain will come.

**Raising Rain Talisman**
Inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper.

**Incantation:**
Five Spirits of the Great Ultimate, revolving divine thunder.
Rising in the east at Yang Valley, moving west to Dragon Terrace.
Southward turning to the Fire Palace, northward circling to River Chariot.
The wheel crushes Kongtong, heaven and earth spin in revolution.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Black Emperor of the North’s law commands.*

Then, grasping the talisman and wielding the sword, recite the incantation:
By the Emperor’s decree, I swiftly summon the two mighty envoys of the north, Wei and Guo, to urgently supervise. The local City God and Earth Spirit, the Dragon King of this place—hasten to send forth sweet rain, swiftly let the downpour soak the earth, rescue the seedlings and crops, and suffer no delay.
*Swiftly, swiftly.*

**Rain-Summoning Incantation (recite three times):**
Flying heavens turn to fire, revolving divine thunder.
Rising in the east at Yang Valley, moving west to Dragon Terrace.
Southward turning to the Fire Palace, northward circling to River Chariot.
The wheel crushes Kongtong, heaven and earth spin in revolution.
Thunder flips the sky, rivers and seas surge in collapse.
Drive the dragons to bring rain—where the talisman arrives, swiftly follow.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Black Emperor of the North’s decree commands.*

Next, present the memorial document.
Pour the libation.
When finished, recite again:

**Rain-Hastening Incantation:**
Mysterious Dark of the Great Yin, five qi respond to essence.
Rising clouds bring rain, great power manifests in might.
Spouting water to rescue beings, dispelling evil miasma.
By the names and stations of Chen Star, the Six Jia divide their forces.
Ascending and descending in harmonious qi, above and below interact in resonance.
Dragons and serpents swiftly rise, thunder roams in free passage.
*Hūm hūm, swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*

When the incantation is complete, burn this talisman in a water vessel, recite the Water Youth Incantation, sprinkle water to the four directions, and trace from *wu* to *zi*, scattering the northern qi.

Next, burn the Leaping Dragon Talisman and recite the Jade Emperor’s Great Lord Mulang Yuanzun Incantation.

**Mulang Incantation:**
In the east of the Jade Pool, beneath crystalline jade radiance,
The sacred ones of the Covenant’s Might command the Azure Youth.
Hurl fire ten thousand leagues to the Kan and Zhen palaces,
Rain-riders swiftly depart in great torrents.
Mulang, heroic lord of the Three Mountains,
Thunder splits stone, spring sources flow free.
Qian, Zhen, Xun, and Kun—earth and luminous spirits converge,
Four fierce steeds charge forth in a burst of fire.
Flowing essence and dense light rush to Zhu Rong,
Mighty spirits of Mount Taihua ascend into the clouds.
Black banners and dark standards soar through empty space,
Obscuring the sun, steaming rain, clouds gather thick.
Yan Bo shakes the peaks of Kunlun,
Hidden spirits churn the sea, merging with the dark abyss.
Feng Yi drums and dances, roaring winds rise,
The weak waters of Penglai achieve their great work.

Swift as lightning, the dragon-eagle soars forth to quell the inauspicious,
Crimson-maned, vast of wing, its twin eyes like smoldering embers.
From its maw it spews thunder and venom to drive the Five Dragons,
The Four Seas shrouded in gloom, veiled in darkening mists.
At its cry, the four seas plunge into murk,
Wherever its rain-array advances, rivers surge in flood.
Golden light and flowing essence sever the drought-rainbow,
The cavernous Yang spirits summon the hidden depths.
The Jade Thunder’s radiant masters transform Kongtong,
The August Void of Taihua sweeps away demonic pests.
The Darkling Host of the Mysterious August Ones cries out as vanguard,
The shrine-springs unleash their mirage-might to awe Heaven’s Lord.
In a flash, fire-edicts pierce the vault of heaven,
Whips lash at demons and drive off serpents and worms.
Julu and Jili blaze in scorching tracks,
Dengseng and Zeze heed every command.
The Weaving Maiden, the Four Elders, and Xin the Loyal,
Assist me in rescuing from drought, their merit resplendent.
Crimson fowl and purple geese fly without end,
Seizing malevolence and binding specters, dispatching them to Northern Feng.
The Purple Void Primordial Lady is commanded to descend and seize.

*Swift as fire, by the Fire-Link Marshal’s edict!*

Nine Heavens’ swift and nimble, driving thunder and hastening dragons to summon rain—

**Seated Practice**
At midnight, the hour of *zi*, rise and sit up. Don your robe, then rub your hands together until they grow scorching hot. Mimic washing your face, and wipe your eyes. Open them, exhale the turbid *qi* from your abdomen, and draw in pure *qi* through your nose to fill your heart and belly. Strike your teeth three times, and visualize your Original Destiny Perfected within your brows, standing in your likeness.

Next, recite the *Incantation for Gathering Spirits*:
*"True King within the radiance, your might shakes the Nine Heavens.
Hands cradle the Three Pristine, feet tread the Nine Mysteries.
Golden Tiger veils the sun, Azure Dragon coils the *Qian*.
Yellow Spirit wields iron, Green-Toothed lashes the whip.
Patrolling the Five Peaks, harmonizing the Seven Primes.
By imperial decree, I transform and prolong life.
Since the Great Ultimate first stirred, years have passed for me.
Now wielding talismanic command, I grasp authority’s thunder.
Wind and thunder clash, lightning roars in fury.
Dividing day from night, I examine ghosts to their roots.
Master of the Thunder Bureau—justice knows no bias.
All I command must obey my word.
Swift as the law’s decree!"*

After the incantation, visualize your primordial spirit ascending to pay homage to the True King. Three *cun* above the brows lies the True King’s palace. Next, envision the Ten Officials and Great Unity Perfected Lords encircling you.

Recite the next incantation:
*"Jade Clarity congeals brilliance, the Nine *Qi* arise naturally.
Transformations birth spirits across the Thirty-Six Heavens.
Sun and moon’s majestic light, thunder chariots vast as clouds.
Heaven azure, earth black—annihilate demons, purge spirits.
I now examine and judge, all heavens descend in audience.
Wind flies, lightning turns—ten thousand spirits obey.
Swift as the Primordial One *Qi* Heavenly Lord’s decree!"*

Next, visualize the nine *qi* of the liver, emerald-hued, ascending to coil around the *Milo* Heaven. Then envision the three *qi* of the south, crimson, merging with the heart to form golden *qi*, blending within the spleen’s palace. Briefly hold your breath, and exhale this golden *qi* from the spleen to encircle your body.

With both hands, first lift the left external kidney with your left hand. Hold your breath once, and visualize kidney water surging upward then descending, uniting with heart fire to coalesce at the navel wheel. Press your tongue against your lower teeth, awaiting the water’s rise and fire’s descent. Swallow into the lung’s palace, where golden light intertwines, forming a Perfected who ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Void Emperor.

Recite the *Lesser Golden Light Incantation*, swallow saliva three times, then stretch your hands to circulate the *qi* through mountains and peaks. The practice concludes—sleep as if in the outer Dipper.

**Rainbow Manifestation Method**
Before noon, face west; after noon, face east. Assume the thunder mudra with your hands, gaze at the sun, and recite:
*"Sun’s soul, vermilion radiance, gleams through green jade.
Crimson lads of returning mist, dark flames in whirlwind guise.
By my oral decree, swiftly reveal your true form!
A thousand-mile rainbow, five-colored barrier.
Swift by the Solar Emperor’s command!"*

Additional incantation:
*"Rainbow, appear swiftly! Rain divides east and west.
Hasten! Stretch across the sky! Fill the void!"*

After reciting, exhale three breaths—it will manifest instantly in the air.

**Shenxiao True Writ for Summoning Thunder and Invoking Rain**
Write every four characters as a separate line.

Use azure paper, one *chi* and six *cun* long, inscribed in cinnabar. Face the *xun* direction to summon thunder spirits. Cast it into a dragon pool or present it to the Thunder Bureau—responses are unfailing. Writing one or two characters can cure myriad illnesses, expel all malevolence, and ensure safe passage through storms, dragons, or other perils. Upon achieving mastery, wear it to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven of Shenxiao, becoming an attendant minister of the Golden Towers.

To treat madness or demonic afflictions, add the *Xuhuo* talisman—results are immediate.

With utmost reverence, I summon the Great Spirit of Sudden Fire, Deng Bowen,
leading one hundred thousand thunder-fire soldiers and divine marshals into my talisman,
to burn and consume demonic thieves, rendering clear and manifest retribution.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Emperor’s Decree!

Hasten with wind and fire to receive the command—
spray forth to reveal karmic response.
Swiftly, swiftly!

Upon completing the incantation, spray water and trace the Dipper’s cover,
allowing the qi of the *xun* direction to enter the water.

Recite again:
Great Spirit of Sudden Fire, Deng Bowen.
*Om.*
Slay and seize!

Mighty Thunder Duke of the Law, thunderbolts and lightning-fire seize!
For those who wish to break demonic shrines and sorcerous mediums,
write in cinnabar on crimson silk,

**Talisman for Qi Supplementation**

**Quiet Stabilization and Talisman Inscription**
In stillness, inscribe these two characters—*hēng* and *xián*—within the circle. Once the talisman is complete, recite the *Celestial Numen’s Splendor Mantra*. Draw in the eastern *qi*, then trace the following sequence: *gé-sì-zhèng-chén-jī-mǎo-gāng-yín-héng*, marking each on the thumb—first the upper joint, then the middle, then the root. Repeat and inscribe the *shà* character.

**The Divine Empyrean’s Supreme Dao: Transmission of the Divine Empyrean’s Vibrant Teachings**

**Arcane Secrets of Thunder’s Mechanism**
**The Flying *Gang* and Interlocking *Qian* for Deploying the Dipper**

The Fire Master said: The Jade Clarity’s hidden language, the Primordial Origin’s secret texts—these are not for the uninitiated to hear. Once, the True King of Jade Clarity transmitted them to the Five Marchmounts’ Elders, who then passed them to the world.

Thunder and lightning are the *qi* of yin and yang clashing fiercely. There is the divine being Xie Xianhuo, the supreme commander of the seventy-two divisions of wind and fire. And there is the mighty spirit Deng Bowen, who wields the authority to issue decrees, burn demonic shrines, topple temples, summon rain, and command clear skies—he is the marshal of the Thunder Department’s statutes and ordinances.

Those who uphold this method must practice it with care. Each year, during the three days before and after the *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects) festival in mid-spring, when thunder first sounds, enter profound meditation and transform the spirit as prescribed. Fill yourself with the *gang qi*, purify the viscera, and amplify divine might.

Next, form the Five Thunder Seal, retract the claws and conceal the nails, cross the arms at the waist, sit upright, and with a stern voice and fierce countenance, shake the Gate of Heaven. Draw in the *qi* of lightning to align with the yang’s nine-by-nine configuration. From the earth gate, gather the *qi* of thunderfire to correspond with the yin’s six-by-six completion. Seize the lightning and flying thunder, and contain them within the primordial palace. Conceal them in the *Kan* trigram; whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, maintain this practice.

Whenever thunder and lightning converge, act without delay. With sufficient *qi*, you may summon thunder in broad daylight, and it will naturally respond. In spring and summer, visualize the Wind Earl and Rain Master, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, descending swiftly from the sky. In autumn and winter, envision thunder and lightning emerging from the stars and constellations.

For regular use, dispatch an observer to note the direction from which ominous clouds or malevolent winds arise. The ritual master then gathers primordial *qi*, hurls lightning, and roars thunder toward that direction, releasing it from the crown of the head. The response will arrive within an hour. After three years of practice, every invocation will yield immediate results.

When summoning thunder, form the Five Thunder Seal and issue the command from *xū-hài* to *shēn*. Once the method is mastered, practice diligently to wield Heaven’s authority, succor the people and all beings, and expel demonic forces—this is no trifling matter.

The adept’s spirit merges with the divine, and their essence flows in communion with Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are said to be eighty-four thousand *li* apart, the adept’s spirit traverses this distance within their own body. Thus, the myriad transformations arise within the self, and the cosmos rests in the palm of the hand.

Reflect deeply upon this, guard it well, and do not disclose it to the unworthy. The Dao does not betray those who attain it; through diligent effort and unwavering focus, one naturally achieves transcendence.

**Master Wan’s Transmission** states: Thunder withdraws its voice in the eighth month, concealing itself beneath the *Kun* earth. From the eighth month (*yǒu*) to the tenth (*hài*), it nurtures within the three yin. From the eleventh month (*zǐ*) to the first (*yín*), it matures within the three yang. Only after the interplay of three yin and three yang does it resound in the second month (*mǎo*), marking the inception of Heaven and Earth’s generation and the first stirrings of all things. It must extend its pent-up emotions and release its stagnant *qi*, causing the pulse of Heaven and Earth to quake and the vitality of life to flow. Without great power, such a vast release would be impossible. After half a year of accumulation, it erupts in a single day—nothing in the myriad things can resist it, for it is the earth’s surplus blackness venting forth.

Thus, the day of its emergence is not arbitrary: it may be *wù-jǐ*, *chén-xū-chǒu-wèi*, or the day of *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), all tied to the earth’s resonance with the cyclical signs of generation. Though exceptions exist, eight or nine out of ten cases align with this pattern. This is why the sages of old drew upon these correspondences to model the divine thunder’s fire.

For when the first yang returns and takes form beneath *wù-jǐ*, its momentum becomes irresistible. Thus, the creative forces of half a year’s decree must be nurtured in concealment for another half-year before their power is realized—how could this be a shallow matter?

**Lightning Incantation**
*Lightning, lightning,*
emerging from the *Kan* direction.
Spewing fire for ten thousand *li*,
ascending to the Celestial Palace.
I invoke the Emperor’s salvation,
drawing it into the heart’s sovereign.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as lightning seizes!*

**Jade Emperor’s Personal Mechanism Talisman and Mudra**
Wind as Heaven, *yín* fire as Earth,
* sì* the sun and moon as conduits,
*shēn* the four mountains to command and restrain.
*hài* mountain’s fire blazes,
*yín* mountain’s fire blazes,
*mǎo* severs, *chén* severs, *sì* annihilates, *sì* seizes.
At *wǔ*, thunderfire emerges—point backward and flick once.

**Thunder Summons:**
Heavenly Thunder, rise swiftly!

Dragon Thunder, rise swiftly!
Divine Thunder, rise swiftly!
Earth Altar Thunder, rise swiftly!
As Heaven and Earth darken and sun and moon lose their light,
the Five Directions’ Thunder Gods descend swiftly to the Mystic Altar’s precinct.

Close the eyes, rotate nine times, and with a single stroke ascend past the character *shān*.

**Incantation:**
First rotation: the cosmos quakes.

The Thunder Ancestor, True August Emperor, descends with thunderous decree by the karmic law. The incantation complete, raise the mudra and cast the brush—point toward *Zhèn* and *Xùn* for swift response, toward *Lí* for response within three hours, toward *Kǎn*, *Duì*, and *Kūn* for no response, toward *Qián* and *Gèn* for partial response.

The Jade Emperor’s personal mechanism incantation,
the Golden Watchtower’s command,
issues forth to the Mystic True.
The personal mechanism blazes with majesty,
heaven and earth both tremble.
The Jade Talisman’s true characters,
each stroke distinct and clear.
Once invoked, the Dipper darkens;
twice invoked, the sun dims.
Seven invocations, lightning flashes,
thunderclaps shake the heavens.
The moment the golden talisman arrives,
it must not linger long.
The myriad demons all shatter,
reduced to fine dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Emperor’s decree commands.

Forty-nine recitations—
the thunder’s essential subtlety:
Yin and yang’s great executioner, most efficacious,
pray for rain or beseech clear skies, and it manifests in an instant.
The Jade Emperor’s personal mechanism preserves the secret formula;
only the banished immortal may transmit it.
Without sending written words to the Golden Watchtower,
one lifts their gaze and cries aloud—lightning crashes down.
Disheveled, they pace the steps to seek the *sha* qi,
the sword’s tip ignites with fire to burn the true script.
In an instant, the vast sky blackens,
and in that fleeting moment, fire-clouds arise.
A single thunderclap shakes heaven and earth,
and in every realm of *Jambudvīpa*, all flee the celestial roar.

**Thunder and Jade Canon: Green Water’s Internal Workings #1**
Green waters, blue waves, limpid and clear,
first step through the *Huòluò* Dipper,
reach the Celestial Flower Star,
assume the *vajra* seated posture,
clench both fists firmly,
press the *Hài* seal,
and with the mouth, draw in the upper kidney *qi*,
unite it with the heart’s palace,
then tap the *Huáchí* thirty-six times and swallow,
visualizing the divine water’s clarity.

A thousand-catty axe’s blade, light upon the back.
Press both hands to the seat,
visualize the thousand sinews and meridians all unobstructed,
the divine water naturally ascending the spine,
the White Tiger’s river chariot reaching the *Níwán* Palace at the crown.
Willows by the riverbank, blown down by the wind—
visualize the celestial tree toppling into the celestial pond,
descending through the Twelve Towers,
entering the Three Passes.

The willow is a star’s name. The Celestial Pond is the forehead. Even if embracing Chang’e, one remains unstartled.

Clasp both hands together, cupping them below the navel, where divine water irrigates the five viscera without leakage, and the Alchemical Maiden resides within to govern the divine water.

When white, it is white as snow in the heavens.
Form the Five Thunder Seal with both hands, and from the mouth exhale wind and clouds, issuing from the *Xùn* Gate and *Zhèn* Palace, converging with celestial thunder and wind, passing from *Kǎn* to *Duì* and exiting through *Xùn*.

When red, it is red as the blood of the crimson ape.
With both hands in the Thunder Formation, the tongue becomes the thunder axe, the gallbladder the thunderclap, and the heart the verifying fire. Lead the five *qi*, summon thunder and rain, emerge from the Celestial Gate, penetrate the *Xùn* Gate to become wind and clouds, and harmonize with the workings of creation. From the flanks to the head, raise the hands in the Thrusting Seal.

When light, it is light as dust in the void.
Once all spirits have emerged, interlock the middle fingers of both hands and gather the spirit of the spleen to guard its abode.

When heavy, it is heavy as a thousand-catty iron.
Again form the Five Thunder Seal with both hands, drawing back all emitted spirits, each transforming into the *qi* of true thunder and covering the body—this is called the "Joyous Surge," and the body now weighs a thousand catties.

The Weaving Maid and the Fourth Brother—
these are the Twenty-Eight Constellations, specifically the Earth Bat.
Lead the thunder spirits of the eight directions and eight trigrams, who reside in the eight nodes of the body—hands and feet.

*Jùlóu jílì.*
These are the names of the eight trigrams. With the union of the two thunder fires, the thunder spirits below sit in attendance.

*Hasten, hasten, as the law of thunder and sudden fire commands!*
Hold the command tablet and ascend the altar, transforming and verifying the fire seal, credentials, and joint decrees.

Recite the right-hand incantation five times, drawing five breaths of true thunder *qi* from the *Xùn* direction into the tea, visualizing divine radiance and purple *qi* infusing it. Shift to the *Wǔ* Seal, turn *Dīng* toward the south, and intone:
*Chíyùnjiāchí.*
*Jiāchē dàhuǒ shū, nánfāng bǐngdīng shè.*
*True fire descends swiftly.*

Recite the right-hand incantation thrice, inhale three breaths of southern fire *qi*, and blow them into the tea to transform the spirits. Break the Earthly Stem, silently summon the thunder spirits, and present the tea with the joint decree, burning the credentials along with the memorial text, the Celestial Emperor’s Talisman, and the Great Slaying Thunder Talisman. Use the Yang Light Seal, Yin Light Seal, and Joint Decree Seal—these are the master seals of wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning.

Again step the Earth-Breaking Stem, omitting its incantation, and internally perform the Three-Step Stem Seal of the thunder spirits. Silently recite the Thunder-Raising Incantation:
*Oṃ. Nyeḥ □□□ hūṃ □□ sarva-buddha-svāhā.*
*Xūxū xūxū lúlū xū lúlū xū hōnghōnghōng.*

Also recite:
The Green Emperor’s kerchief,
the Red Emperor’s staff,
the White Emperor’s robe,
the Black Emperor’s bridle.
The Yellow Emperor’s grandson,
the Grand Brilliance’s office.
Coming from non-coming,
departing toward no realm.
Emerging as wind and thunder,
stirring as thunderclaps.
Fire stars race,
thunder’s light blazes.
Ghosts wail, spirits grieve,
heaven and earth darken.
Sun and moon conjoin,
yin and yang align in order.
I bear the Heavenly Seal,
by the Emperor’s decree.
I summon you to transform—
respond swiftly, cease delay.
True *qi* gathers in hand,
hasten, hasten, swiftly, swiftly!
By the authority of the True King’s Convenient Thunder Law.

Once the Five Peaks and Four Waterways are stirred, visualize the sudden fire fanning, and heaven and earth turn black.

*Bǐngdīng* spirits, by decree seize the numinous.
Xuanyuan commands the sudden fire—
hasten, hasten, follow my steps!
Visualize the verifying fire descending from the southeast before the altar.

*Lí jílì, lóu jílì.*
Xuanyuan commands the sudden fire—
hasten, hasten, follow my steps!
Visualize the thunder spirits from the five directions riding black clouds, surging into the celestial vastness.

Silently recite the Thunder-Moving Incantation:
*Oṃ. Yùdì mó ní zǒng léi hōng zhà bō hē shè.*

The Rain-Summoning, Evil-Expelling Incantation from *Kǎn* to *Wǔ*:
The Supreme Mystery’s Radiant Master, essence of *Lí* fire,
binds yin and gathers yang to guard the Thunder City.
*Yànbó*’s wind and fire settle the abyssal court,
bringing rain, raising hail, rousing hidden spirits.
Command the lofty Hua, summon the Duke’s guests—
the Emperor decrees: act swiftly!
Gather yang to descend rain in an instant,
drive thunder, wield lightning from the dark abyss.
I now carry out the decree with haste.
This is the name the Celestial Emperor commands—
dare any disobey? The crime is not light!
*Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!*

This talisman and incantation may be employed to expel evil, cure illness, and offer prayers. Success lies in wholehearted reverence—none shall fail to be moved or remain unresponsive.

The Thunder-Moving Secret Incantation:
*Oṃ. Hēi liè □ léi bīng hōng hōng □ lǐ bù jiàn xíng mó ní dì chì.*
*Roaring slaying, fierce generals, vehement spirits—all are seized!*
*Evil demons are reduced to fine dust.*

With both hands in the Thunder Formation, blow *qi* from the northeast, visualizing within the black clouds the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, the divine thunder roaring. Proceed to a designated place to bring rain, or to the afflicted person’s body to strike evil spirits.

The Yang Light Incantation:
Following the Three Realms,
first hasten to the Primordial Vastness.
River waves transform destiny,
subtly heed the dark heavens.
On the day of concealment,
stir the thick *qi*.
Universally transforming humans and heavens,
evil dare not oppose.
*Hasten, hasten, as the law of thunder commands!*

The Yin Light Incantation:
Waves flow beside the true river,
River Earl, immortal true fire,
immortal flame, vast penetrating truth.
*Seize swiftly!*

The Method for Halting Yin-Yang Thunder and Activating the Grand Year’s Slaying Direction:
*Jiǎzǐ* seeks *chái* in *jiǎxū* and *yín*,
*jiǎshēn* and *chén* clearly mark the start.
*Jiǎwǔ* in the *Lí* Palace, *jiǎyín* in *xū*,
*jiǎchén* and *shēn* are fine positions.
Moving counterclockwise, skipping one palace, one hears of enmity’s path in *zǐ* and *chǒu*—
proceeding in order, one must not act.
Only when *chǒu* and *yín* connect in sequence may one go;
in a *guǐ* year, leap two celestial stems.
If thunder is raised to excite the slaying force,
even a vajra will be reduced to dust.

For example, in the *jiǎyín* decade of ten years, the Grand Year moves counterclockwise from *xū*. Leaping one palace to *yín*, this is the *wùwǔ* year’s beginning. The Grand Year then starts from its position, moving counterclockwise through consecutive palaces to find the current month. From the month, proceed clockwise through consecutive palaces, beginning the count at the *hài* hour and continuing to *mǎo*—this is the thunder-slaying direction.

Where it begins is the thunder, where it ceases is the lightning.
**Method for Determining the Starting Month:**
The Grand Year’s earthly branch marks the start of the first month.
Moving counterclockwise, seek the current month to know its position.
From the month’s position, proceed clockwise beginning at the *hài* hour;
the starting point is the thunder-slaying force, counting to the *mǎo* palace where the slaying spirit’s heart resides.
Where it ceases, the slaying becomes lightning.
If thunder and lightning are raised to excite the slaying force,
even a vajra will be reduced to dust.

**Directions for Major Slaying Forces on Inauspicious Days and Hours (Metal Tiger, Flowing Fire, and Malevolent Stars):**
*Jiǎ* and *yǐ* reside in *kūn*; *wù* and *guǐ* in *xī*—proceed clockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.
*Yǐ* and *gēng* occupy *lí*, moving counterclockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.
*Dīng* and *rén* shift clockwise from *xùn*.
From *xùn*, begin at *jiǎzǐ*; *bǐng* and *xīn* stir thunder in *zhèn*—fly counterclockwise into the central palace for careful reckoning.
First determine whether the flight is clockwise or counterclockwise.
Examine the day’s cyclical sign to see which *jiǎ* sequence it belongs to,
then count from the head of that decade to the day’s position.
From the day’s position, begin at the *zǐ* hour and count to the desired hour—
this is the direction where the major slaying force descends.
If clockwise, proceed clockwise; if counterclockwise, proceed counterclockwise.
Upon reaching the central palace, lodge it in the *kūn* position for application.

**Example:**
In the *wùwǔ* year, the seventh month, thirteenth day (*gēngshēn* day),
begin counterclockwise from *jiǎzǐ*.
Start from *wǔ* with the six *jiǎ* signs:
*jiǎzǐ*, *jiǎxū*, *jiǎshēn*, *jiǎwǔ*, *jiǎchén*, *jiǎyín*, *jiǎyín* (repeated in *xùn* and *zhèn*),
then begin *yǐmǎo* and proceed through the sequence to the desired day.
From there, add the *zǐ* hour and count to the desired hour—
this is the major slaying force.
The rest follow this example.
For the *jiǎzǐ* decade, do not seek the *jiǎ* head; instead, count the six *jiǎ* from *yǐchǒu*.

**Qi Formula for Flying Slaying Forces:**
*Jiǎ* and *jǐ* dragons fly as the cock crows at dawn;
*chén* and *yǒu* see *yǐ* and *gēng* tigers roar, fearing the flight of the ram.
From *yín*, *wèi* emerges; *bǐng* and *xīn* share the qi of monkey and dog.
From *shēn* and *xū*, *dīng* and *rén* return to the southern palace’s *kǎn* gate.
From *wǔ* and *zǐ*, *wù* and *guǐ* thunder issues from the *duì* palace;
from *mǎo* and *yǒu*, celestial thunder’s slaying power flourishes with heavenly mechanism.
All under heaven’s demonic forces dread it,
as thunderbolts cleave the sky with flashing lightning.
On *jiǎjǐ* days, the Metal Tiger’s hidden thunder lies in *chén*;
on *sì* days, in *yǒu*—face this direction to pace the Dipper,
burn talismans according to the method, and command with a shout.
**Adaptations for Wind-Fire Mandates:**
1. Commonly used to subdue ghosts
2. To pray for rain
3. To pray for clear skies
4. To pray for snow
5. To summon thunder

### **The Secret Whispered Petition of the Mysterious Numinous #1**
#### **Preface to the Secret Whispered Petition of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman**
The Northern Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, governing the pivot of creation and transformation, serving as the master of human spirits. All fortune and misfortune, regret and shame in a person’s life are subject to its sway. The methods of petitioning the Dipper, transmitted by sages of former ages, each possess manifest efficacy. The purposes of such petitions vary, each with its own specialization.

Our Patriarch, Sun the Perfected, in his flight of spirit to audience with the Thearch, chanced upon the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman, who bestowed upon him this swift and essential whispered petition. The method is named *Stove Register*, and the lamp is called *Thousand Eyes*, dedicated to memorializing the Controller of Fate. Though the text is brief, its efficacy is swift.

The Controller of Fate is the Nine Heavens Efficacious Fire Primordial Lord, commissioned by the Heavenly Thearch to memorialize the affairs of the human realm. All prayers and supplications are invariably answered, for this is the utmost Dao in its unadorned simplicity. The Perfected, moved by compassion for the people of the world, transmitted it to later learners. Those who obtain it should preserve and revere it; it must not be shown to the unworthy.

Respectfully inscribed by Li Xisheng.

### **The Precious Register of the Mysterious Numinous for Prolonging Life, Delivering from Distress, and Dispersing Calamities**
With utmost reverence, I present this petition, unable to refuse the sincerity of the supplicant. I have heard that the Great Thearch, in his boundless grace, expounds the teachings of the Supreme True, while the August Elder proclaims the decrees of the Jade Bureau, and the Northern Dipper bestows the *Book of the Mysterious Numinous*. Its profundities defy description; its sagely power is unfathomable.

Facing the Northern Culmen, I inscribe this talisman and register, recording the supplicant’s circumstances in accordance with ancestral protocols. Entrusted to the Controller of Fate for presentation, it ascends to the office of the Throat and Tongue, and descends to relieve the afflictions of the heart and viscera. May swift response be granted to fulfill this devout prayer.

All true talismans shall be duly proclaimed and enacted.

**Void Talisman**

This talisman and register are dedicated to resolving for [Name] the Three Calamities and Four Baleful Influences, the Five Phases and Six Harms, the Seven Injuries and Eight Difficulties, the Nine Stars in fate, destiny, and life’s allotted span, and all inauspicious spirits and malevolent forces encountered in the current year—distresses of Heavenly Nets and Earthly Snares.

I humbly beseech the Lord Controller of Fate to transmit this sincerity and memorialize it to the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper. Moved by pity for this ignorant mortal, may they assent to my plea. May they specially bestow sagely power and Dao-power, and by the efficacy of this talisman and dharma-power, protect and bless [Name]. May all afflictions be instantly healed, all distresses resolved, all enmities and grudges reconciled, all curses dissolved, all impurities shattered, all demonic influences expelled, all karmic retribution pardoned, all official plagues dispersed, and all ruin and decay steadfastly upheld. May all wishes be fulfilled, truly by the grace of the Mysterious.

**Mysterious Retribution**
The Star Tānláng (Greedy Wolf).

**Rice Diminished (米失):**
For **Tānláng Star (Greedy Wolf)**: The Five Phases exhaust their mandate; celestial bureaus invoke curses. Wealth and property dissipate. The northeast altar grows cold.

For **Jùmén Star (Great Gate)**: Either offending earth and wood, or due to official litigation and curses—this arises when the Wood and Fire Stars converge and descend.

For **Lùcún Star (Wealth Storage)**: Entangled in the misfortune of nets; the household dims. Blood-light female ghosts bring calamity.

For **Wénqǔ Star (Literary Brilliance)**: The western altar turns cold; the household’s qi darkens. Petitioning the Great Yang brings fortune.

For **Liánzhēn Star (Integrity and Chastity)**: The Fire Star of fate shines upon officials; household members face disasters and fire misfortunes. The directional deities and yearly spirits are offended, causing illness in men and women.

For **Wǔqǔ Star (Martial Brilliance)**: Death ghosts in childbirth; the southern altar chills. Relatives perish in succession, harmed by Wood Guests.

For **Pòjūn Star (Breaking Army)**: Stars move inauspiciously—hanging ghosts bring legal punishments, disputes, and oral conflicts. The southern altar cools; ghosts afflict the young with misfortune.

For **Zuǒfǔ Star (Left Assistant)**: Celestial bureaus invoke northern yin vows.

For **Yòubì Star (Right Assistant)**: Knife wounds, fire burns, and ghostly malice.

For **Běnmìng Star (Life Star)**: Stars move inauspiciously; black departs without salvation, severing ominous omens.

For **Seven Stars (Collective Diminished)**: Frequent calamities plague the household; the young face unforeseen dangers. All affairs are unfavorable; the sick grow worse.

---

**Rice Stirred (米动):**
For **Tānláng Star**: Celestial bureaus impose punishments; past transgressions must be guarded against and repented.

For **Jùmén Star**: The Yuefu’s seventy-two offices and city gods issue yin retributions.

For **Lùcún Star**: Fortune spirits weaken; slaves, servants, and external ghosts bring harm. They should be pacified and sent away.

For **Wénqǔ Star**: Bewitched by others; the household grows restless, and husband and wife discord.

For **Liánzhēn Star**: Disturbing earth offends the official tally, bringing official disasters and severe illness to men and women.

For **Wǔqǔ Star**: The stars of the year’s fate and destiny’s limits turn unfavorable.

For **Pòjūn Star**: Small fortune.

For **Zuǒfǔ Star**: Ancestral graves and feng shui turn unfavorable, leading to tomb disputes and summons.

---

**Method of Practice:**
Use one lamp, divided into nine branches. Place a Thousand-Eyed Lamp atop it, covering the Stove Controller’s altar. Arrange twenty-four portions of incense, lamps, pure tea, wine, and fruit. Set up a Dipper of white, pure rice in the designated location. The ritual master recites incantations silently, without uttering a sound.

Alternatively, burn these offerings directly. Use a set of golden paper money, horses, and Stove Ritual implements, burning them in the stove.

**Judgment:**
When the stars’ rice blackens, the master perishes.
When the stars gather, epidemics arise.
When the stars vanish, lifespans end.
When the stars remain still, the sick recover.
When rice increases, wealth and longevity bring all fortune.
When rice diminishes, misfortune surely follows.
If people do not trust Master Sun’s method,
How can later learners determine fortune or misfortune?

**Recognizing the Three Terraces Method**
The Three Terraces comprise six stars, positioned above the Dipper’s handle, aligned in pairs. Men who recognize them avoid imprisonment’s misfortunes; women who recognize them escape the perils of childbirth. Those who cultivate immortality and refine the true must especially know them.

Whenever the Three Terraces’ six stars are seen, clasp hands in reverence, visualize the bow, and silently recite the incantation:
*"Upper Terrace: Void Essence,
Middle Terrace: Sixfold Purity,
Lower Terrace: Curved Life.
Erase this servant’s name from death’s register,
Inscribe this servant’s name for eternal life.
Promote to lofty rank,
Enthroned in Heaven’s court.
Heart and mind brighten,
Ears and eyes grow keen.
Three souls endure forever,
Extending life a thousand years.
Ascend to the Golden Gate,
Gaze upon Jade Clarity.
Ride the dragon, mount the clouds,
Attain the rank of Immortal Minister.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

*"The Three Terraces gave me birth,
The Three Terraces nurtured me,
The Three Terraces protect me.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

After reciting, gaze toward the stars’ celestial path, seek the grace of the Dao, offer prayers as you wish, bow thrice in the heart, and click the teeth three times before withdrawing.

**Seeking the Imperial Throne Method**
The two stars at the Dipper’s mouth—the Venerable Star on the left, the Imperial Star on the right—shine like the sun and moon upon those of the Dao, but not upon the unvirtuous. Those who see the Venerable Star live three hundred years; those who see the Imperial Star live six hundred years.

On the third and twenty-seventh nights of each month, await their appearance. This must be done in the quiet of night, unknown to others. When the two stars appear, seek the Dao with wholehearted devotion, and tell no one. If one lacks perseverance, sincerity, or discipline, or grows lax midway, the stars will not be seen.

Those who refine the true should secretly pray to them often, never revealing the stars’ names to the unworthy. Keep them constantly in mind, and in times of need, silently invoke their names. Never face north to weep, disrobe, or let hair loose beneath the stars’ light—this is the strictest prohibition.

When awaiting the two stars, first pace the Dipper, burn incense, and bow twice, visualizing the Dipper’s mouth where the two stars appear like the sun and moon. Then recite the incantation:
*"Venerable and Imperial Stars,
Spirits of the Northern Culmen.
May this servant soon behold you,
And upon seeing, attain eternal life.
Inscribe this servant as a flying immortal,
Strike this servant’s name from death’s register.
Boundless fortune and blessings,
Equal to Heaven’s years.
Swiftly ascend to the Immortal Capital,
Soar through Supreme Clarity.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

Bow twice more, envisioning the two stars descending in purple cloud-qi, entering through your Mud-Pill Palace and bathing your eyes. Recite the incantation again:
*"Venerable and Imperial Stars,
Spirits of the Northern Culmen.
Now revealed, now concealed,
Grant this servant eternal life.
Inscribe this servant as a flying immortal,
Strike this servant’s name from death’s register.
Boundless fortune and blessings,
Equal to Heaven’s years.
Soon transcend the Three Realms,
Roam through Supreme Clarity.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*

After reciting, bow twice more, stand briefly in stillness, focus the spirit, and gaze at the Dipper’s mouth while silently repeating the incantation seven times. Then withdraw for a short while. If the stars appear, bow again and pray for longevity, offering your heartfelt wishes. Continue nightly worship without interruption—any lapse nullifies all prior merit.

Those of disciplined conduct who refine the true may transcend the mortal and enter the sagely, ascending to serve the Jade Emperor. Those who practice this with utmost dedication attain eternal life and ascend upon merit’s fulfillment. Ordinary practitioners extend their years. Do not reveal this to the unworthy; treasure and guard it well.

Formerly, Supreme Perfection Realized Person of Wangwu Mountain transmitted this to Master Zhang Guolao, who practiced it in secret and later ascended as an immortal, becoming one of the ancient sagely transcendents.

**Secret Crane-Summoning Method #2**
Cranes come in many kinds: the Bamboo Crane of Dongcheng, the Reed Crane of Jibin, the Soaring Crane of Huaishan, and the Feather Crane of Qingcheng Mountain—these are the common traditions of past and present. As when Celestial Master Han rode the Nine Clouds Crane, Perfected Lord Xu mounted the Wind-Riding Crane, Ge Zhichuan flew the Jade Mist Crane, and Perfected Lord Zhongli Zhengyang ascended on the Grand Empyrean Crane—such accounts are indeed true.

The proverb says: "The stork bears three offspring, one of which is a crane"—this refers to the crane born of the womb, not the feathered crane of Penglai, nor the cinnabar-crested crane of Purple Tenuity that cries to the heavens. It is neither the white-robed dancer of the Jasper Terrace nor the white-garbed whistler of the Celestial Pivot. How could Pure Yang Perfected Lord Lü’s crane be merely a fleeting apparition?

When cranes come, they soar through autumn’s clear skies and cry to the deep night’s moon. Immortals who ride cranes come and go—truly, those who attain the Dao, refine the true, and transcend the dust may obtain this scripture and summon them with flying talismans. They will arrive in graceful flight, soaring through the heavens, not merely calling from the Nine Marshes.

Petition to the Sacred Thearch of Southern Marchmount:
[Your] humble servant, [Name] of such-and-such position.
To the right, [I], [Name], now submit this petition...

May it deeply concern [Your Eminence] that the worldly and foolish remain deluded, disbelieving in the Dao and its methods. Now desiring to propagate the teachings and spread their influence, that the people may come to revere them and the Great Dao flourish, [I] humbly approach Your August Marchmount to request the loan of several simurghs and cranes. On such-and-such a day at noon, may they descend to the ritual altar, circling and dancing above and below, offering obeisance with bowed heads and bared forms. When the noon audience concludes, may they be immediately dispatched back to their posts, without daring to linger.

Furthermore, [I] beseech the dispatch of the Blue-Green Controller of Cranes, the spirit officer of Penglai, to attend the altar and witness the covenant of the fast. This petition is hereby respectfully submitted.

[Your] humble servant, [Name], most reverently presents this petition before the Sacred Thearch of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Heaven’s Luminous Might. May Your Sagely Compassion deign to grant this earnest plea. Issue commands to the master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau to promptly act in accordance with the matters herein submitted, swiftly dispatching them to ensure the ritual’s completion, transforming both humans and celestials, and perfecting the fast in all its aspects.

[I], [Name], presuming upon Your Sacred Authority, am filled with trembling awe. Respectfully submitted.

In the year of ___, the ___ month, the ___ day, [Name], of such-and-such position, submits this petition.

Submitted to the Master of the Simurgh-and-Crane Bureau of Penglai Mountain, the Perfected Lord of the Day.

On the day following the ritual, a second missive shall be sent, dispatching the Perfected Officer of the current stellar lodge, along with the Directing Talisman, and the Intermediary Director of Merit-Officials, to urgently summon twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six simurghs and cranes, as well as one spirit officer, to attend the altar. Issue the summons again.

The Seven Spirit Officers of Penglai Mountain Who Control Cranes:
First Spirit Officer: Radiant Rosy Clouds
Second Spirit Officer: Jade Radiance
Third Spirit Officer: Golden Fusion
Fourth Spirit Officer: Bian Wen
Fifth Spirit Officer: Treasure Radiance
Sixth Spirit Officer: Qi Yang
Seventh Spirit Officer: Elegant Fruit

These seven spirit officers take turns beginning on the first day of each month. However, on the last day of the lunar month and the full-moon day, the spirit officer named Vermilion Lake does not fall under their jurisdiction and will not respond to summons. Only during the Nine-Yin Yellow Register Grand Offering to the Boundless Heavens will he arrive promptly. At other times, if summoned in jest or frivolity, the invocation will prove ineffective.

This method was taught by the Patriarchal Iron-Crutch Perfected Lord of All Immortals, the August Thearch of the East, who, atop Mount Qingcheng, assembled the host of immortals and summoned cranes from the Southern Marchmount, which arrived riding the void. When the affair concluded, they returned. The teaching was later transmitted to Zhongli, the Perfected Lord of Upright Yang, and to the Purple Void Perfected Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount. It was then passed to Lord Lü Dongbin, the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, who transmitted it to the Immortal Liu Haichan. He, in turn, bestowed it upon the Purple Yang Perfected Lord Zhang of Mount Tiantai. From generation to generation, it has been transmitted thus, reaching the ninth-generation lineage-holding immortal master, the Jade Tube Immortal Elder, through whom it has spread unbroken to the present day.

In the final days of the jiachen year, I unexpectedly had the good fortune to attend a gathering at the Treasure Canopy Grotto of Wuyang, where I served with wholehearted devotion. On the celestial腊 day of the yisi year, I presented this petition with incense, prostrated myself, and entreated my master to accept me as a disciple, to enlighten me on the firing times of the golden elixir’s transformations. From that moment, the secret transmission resonated within me, and all proved true. Thus, I reflect that my master’s kindness towers higher than Mount Sumeru and runs deeper than the vast sea; though I were to grind my bones to powder, I could never repay such virtue.

Did not my master say: “Diligence without encounter leads one to meet a perfected being; encounter without diligence consigns one to become a lowly ghost.” Day and night, through the twelve double-hours, I never forget this admonition. Resolutely, I press forward, my resolve growing ever firmer, vowing to attain the pure, liberated, supreme, and perfectly true Great Dao. Thereby may I deliver my primal ancestors, my three masters and dharma friends, and all karmically connected kin through countless kalpas, universally extending to all beings throughout the dharma realm, that together we may ascend to the joys of the immortals’ realm. How could I dare let this life slip by in vain?

Time passes swiftly, and after several years, I unexpectedly obtained the immortal master’s book on summoning cranes—was this mere chance? Twice, thrice, I prostrated myself upon the earth, paying homage to the patriarchal and immortal masters, and was deemed worthy of receiving their transmission. Thus empowered, I may practice and uphold it, revering the immortal transformations and attaining fruition as a perfected being.

Those who summon cranes must be cultivators of the true, bearers of registers, whose virtue extends to others, whose accumulated merits fill the heavens, whose beneficence nurtures the myriad people, who pray for timely rain and sunshine, who deliver the living and the dead, whose mysterious works are vast and profound, whose names are inscribed on the immortal ranks, and who hold offices of the first or second rank—only such may perform this rite. It is most efficacious.

However, it must be conducted within the great karmic affinity of the Crane Assembly Fast of the Patriarchs, and only then may it be performed three days in advance. The appointed day and hour must be strictly observed for the invocation to prove effective. Those who are not of high rank, office, or virtue may not summon them.

Whoever obtains this method must guard it carefully and not lightly disclose it. Those who do so will immediately incur heavenly retribution. How could one not be cautious? Keep it secret, keep it secret!

Traverse the Five Peaks, let the Eight Seas bear witness.
Demon kings bow their heads, attending and guarding my chamber.
Malevolent impurities dissolve and disperse; the Dao’s darkness endures forever.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Offering Incense and Presenting the Prayer**
Jade splendor scatters light; ninefold qi congeals as mist.
Fragrant clouds densely woven, ascend directly to the Nine Heavens.
Golden Lad Attending Incense, Jade Maiden Transmitting Words,
Receive and convey the fragrant smoke, ascending to the Emperor’s presence.
Let the petitions I now present be granted in full, as spoken.

The officiant, the humble servant [Name], reverently kindles incense, prostrates twice, and respectfully addresses the Three Pristine Supreme Saints, the Ten Loftiest Perfected, the Nine Celestial Thrones of the Divine Empyrean, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns, the Palace of the Sun’s Grand Yang Lord, the Mansion of the Moon’s Grand Yin Sovereign, the Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, the Star Lords of the Seasonal Nodes, the Nine Leaping Star Lords of Supreme Clarity, the Six Offices of the Southern Dipper’s Longevity Star Lords, the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper’s Deliverance Star Lords, the Three Terraces and Canopy Star Lords, the Twelve Palaces’ Hour Star Lords, the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Star Lords, the Three Origins’ Three Ranks’ Three Officials’ Great Emperors, the Four Sagely Perfected of the Northern Culmen’s Dharma Lord, the Five Masters of the Mystery’s Teaching Lord, the Ancestral Master of Orthodox Unity’s Quiescent Response and Manifest Blessing Perfected Lord, the Left Palace Immortal Elder of the Supreme Ultimate, the Three Ministries of Thunder, the Nine Bureaus of Thunder, the Arrayed Lofty Perfected of the Purple Palace’s Gate, the Sagely Hosts of Thunder, the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Mountains, the Great Emperor of Fengdu in the Earthly Prison, the Ten Palaces’ Perfected Lords of the Netherworld, the Great Emperor of Fusang in the Watery Palace, the attending thunder deities, officials, generals, and soldiers, and all true lords of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

May the sagely compassion turn its numinous gaze upon me. I formerly submitted to the tutelage of Preceptor [Name], who memorialized and conferred upon me the talismanic methods of the Supreme Ultimate’s Northern Culmen Jade Treasury, Mysterious Numinosity, Supreme Ultimate, Three Luminaries, and Five Thunders, which I have reverently received and worn upon my person. I have vowed to act as Heaven’s proxy in transforming the world, aiding the state and saving the people, conducting all practices to succor humanity and benefit all beings. In every supplication I offer, I humbly beseech the divine to grant its numinous response.

I prostrate myself, praying that the Great Dao will bestow its compassion, that the myriad heavens will commend my devotion, that my reverent and earnest intent will be cherished, and my past errors and transgressions pardoned. May the Black Registers erase my faults, my immortal rank advance, my departed kin attain deliverance, and all my movements be secure. May the Dao’s qi sustain me, and its numinous radiance illumine me from above. May my body and mind attain purity, so that no evil may assail me. May governance be solemn and orderly, and the hundred spirits stand guard in solemn array. I rely upon the virtue of creation and sustenance, that it may accord with the sincerity of my heart.

The officiant bows his head, knocks his forehead to the ground, and prostrates twice in reverence.

Then, facing east, he clicks his teeth and declares:
The humble servant respectfully addresses the Grand Yang Lord of the Sun Palace. May the sagely compassion permit my petition. May the true qi of the Grand Yang descend and pour into my body, expelling all perverse qi, severing the one hundred and four ailments. Where I gaze upon mountains, may they crumble; where I behold seas, may they dry. Where I regard illness, may it be cured; where I look upon people, may they live. May people take refuge, may ghosts be subdued, and may evil not encroach upon the upright.

With his left hand, he traces the mao trigram, visualizing above his left temple a sun within which stands a disheveled-headed general. The qi of nine rays, like nine strands, descends and pours in, entering through the Sixfold Union Palace of the left side, illuminating body and mind. The Sixfold Union Palace lies one cun above the brow, where the sun returns to the left Sixfold Union.

Secret incantation:
Spirit of Yu Yi, true numen of the Li Palace.
Pour forth the nine rays, primordial, prosperous, advantageous, and steadfast.
[Recited three times]

Upon completing the incantation, he glances to the left side of his head, one chi and five cun away, where nine strands of luminous qi appear. He inhales them into his heart with his mouth.

He recites again:
Oṃ.

Oṃ *va-□-ra-hvī-ca-lī svāhā.*
[Recited nine times]

Next, he faces west and clicks his teeth, addressing above:
Your servant humbly invokes the Supreme Yin Sovereign of the Moon Palace. May Your sagely compassion grant this petition: descend the Jade Radiance of the Supreme Yin, pouring black luminosity into this servant’s body, driving out perverse qi, severing the one hundred and four ailments. Where mountains are beheld, mountains crumble; where seas are seen, seas run dry; where illness is observed, illness is cured; where people are regarded, people flourish. People take refuge; ghosts are subdued and banished; the perverse do not encroach upon the upright.

With his right hand, he traces the you trigram, visualizing above his right temple a moon within which stands a Jade Maiden, holding a ritual scepter. The qi of ten rays, like ten strands, descends and pours in, entering through the Sixfold Union Palace of the right side, illuminating body and mind.

Next, the secret incantation:
Spirit of Jielin, true essence of the Kan Palace.
Round and radiant, ten rays—auspicious, advantageous, and primally flourishing.
[Recited three times]

Upon completing the incantation, he glances to the right side of his head, one chi and five cun away, where ten strands of luminous qi appear. He inhales them into his heart with his mouth.

He recites again:
Oṃ.

Oṃ vaṃ raḥ raḥ svāhā. [Recited ten times]

Next, facing south, he knocks his teeth and addresses the heavens:
Your servant humbly invokes the Great Sage Star Lord of the Celestial Stem. May Your sagely compassion grant this petition: descend with the golden light of upright qi, pour it into this servant’s body, expel perverse qi, sever the one hundred and four ailments. Mountains crumble at the sight, seas dry at the gaze; the sick recover, the living thrive; people take refuge; ghosts are subdued and banished; the perverse do not encroach upon the upright.

With his left hand, he traces the chen trigram; with his right, he forms the sword mudra.

Next, the secret incantation:
Chapter of Śakra Devānām Indra, girded with the Celestial Stem.
The malevolent ghosts of the five directions—
why have they not vanished?
With a single inhalation of the flying immortal,
ten thousand ghosts hide in submission.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.

Upon completing the incantation, he visualizes the Celestial Stem standing in a yellow cloud above his head, clad in plain silk, hair unbound and feet bare, resembling Zhenwu, three-eyed, wielding the Fire Command Sword. From his central eye issues the qi of golden light, which he inhales through his mouth, feeling the golden light fill his mouth, then blows it to coil around his body.

He recites again:
Oṃ. Spirit of the imperial command, true numen of the Dipper’s Pole.
Seven rays flow in radiance—hūṃ tṣaḥ [sound lost].

Upon completing the incantation, he closes his mouth, steadies his breath, and fixes his gaze.

The secret incantation:
Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, foremost star of the Northern Dipper,
golden light of upright qi—
pour into my form.
Demons are all purged;
the body attains longevity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.

Upon completing the incantation, he inhales the qi of the Heavenly Gate and blows it onto the gen trigram, then traces the yin trigram.

The secret incantation:
Oṃ.

Hūṃ hūṃ tát lì suō hē chì shè. Seven times. Upon completing the incantation, from the *yín* trigram he traces upward to the *chén* position, then flicks outward, visualizing the central eye of the Celestial Stem emitting golden light, which pours down to suffuse his body and heart.

Next, he retreats a step, taps his teeth three times, and forms the *biànshén* mudra with both hands—left at the *chén* position, right at the *yǒu* position—then rests them at his waist. First, he visualizes his body as withered wood, pinches the *wǔ* position with both hands, inhales a mouthful of southern *qi*, and blends it with his heart’s *qi* to form true fire. Flicking the *wǔ* position, he ignites the fire at the wood’s roots, burning upward all at once. Next, he pinches the *sì* position, summoning the *xùn* wind to scatter the ashes, leaving no trace of dust or shadow.

He visualizes an infant within his cinnabar field gradually growing, hair unbound and feet bare, clad in a black robe and golden armor, appearing like the True Warrior. Beneath his feet, a dark turtle exhales *qi*; pinching the *zǐ* position, the turtle’s head stirs. The *qi* merges with his kidney *qi*. A red serpent exhales *qi*, merging with his heart *qi*; pinching the *wǔ* position, the serpent’s head stirs. The Northern Dipper enshrouds his body, the Three Terraces stand before him, a sun to his left and a moon to his right. The Celestial Stem hovers above his head, a mighty warrior holding a seven-starred black banner to his left, another mighty warrior bearing a sword case to his right. A circular image crowns his head, its radiance illuminating heaven and earth. Generals and officials stand in solemn array. His left hand forms the Northern Emperor’s mudra, the middle finger pinching the center of the thumb, while his right hand forms the sword mudra.

The secret incantation:
By the law of heaven, numinous and divine,
Great Spirit of the Dark Warrior.
Treading upon the coiling serpent,
crowned with the seven stars.
Wielding the divine sword,
gaze fixed upon the Heavenly Gate.
Might pervades heaven and earth,
enthroned at the Northern Asterism.
Mountain sprites and wayward ghosts
vanish a thousand leagues away.
Grasping the celestial prison,
Great Spirit of the Heavenly Armor,
swiftly descend beneath the altar,
interrogate the nameless.
Where the heavenly records arrive,
forever sever the demonic essence.
Deliver the people from suffering,
bestow great might and numen.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.

Visualizing the spirits in practice:
The Three Hun return to the liver. The liver resides on the left; pinch the *mǎo* position. Visualize three Daoists atop the left side of his head, clad in azure robes, blown by the eastern blue *qi*. They enter from the left Six Harmonies, descend from the upper palate, and he receives them with his tongue, guiding them past the Twelve-Storied Tower to lodge within the liver’s three lobes, like an azure lapis lazuli palace.

The Seven Po return to the lungs. The lungs reside in the center; pinch the *yǒu* position. Visualize seven stars atop the right side of his head, each containing seven Daoists in plain white robes, blown by the western white *qi*. They descend behind the brain, down the spine, spiraling into the shoulder well, passing through the Twelve-Storied Tower to enter the lungs, standing within the jade palace.

Wisdom returns to the spleen; pinch the center of the middle finger. Visualize a monkey and a horse, suffused by the golden light *qi*. They descend from the center of the forehead, passing the Twelve-Storied Tower and the stomach’s entrance, where a golden child sprays water. The monkey and horse, drenched, transform into a golden lion, which he rides downward into the spleen. The monkey is devoured by a *ní* beast, the horse becomes a *bó* steed, and the *ní* stands atop the *bó*, both entering the spleen, which he visualizes as a golden chamber.

Essence returns to the kidneys; pinch the *zǐ* position. Visualize two kidneys along the spine, fuzzy like the sun and moon, the left *qi* with nine strands, the right *qi* with ten rays, piercing straight through the crown to the Parents’ Palace—the Mud Pill Palace. There, he sees the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in nine strands from the left; he taps his teeth and calls: "Grand Unity Lord," three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: "Peach Health Lord," three times. He sees a figure like himself entering the left kidney palace, black clouds dispersing, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. Again, he visualizes the Parents’ Palace’s purple *qi* descending in ten rays from the right; he taps his teeth and calls: "Director of Destinies Lord," three times. It flows directly into the kidneys. He calls: "Union and Extension Lord," three times. He sees a woman-like figure entering the right kidney palace, black clouds retreating, revealing a clear blue sky and bright sun. He visualizes a pool of water within the cinnabar field congealing into ice-jade, solid and unmoving, illuminated by the sun and moon’s radiance from the kidneys. Pinch the *zǐ* position.

The spirit returns to the heart; pinch the *wǔ* position. Visualize the True Warrior’s form within the cinnabar field, identical to his own, summoning the spirits of his entire body.

The secret incantation:
May the ten thousand spirits unite with my heart.
Seven times.

Soon, he sees the ten thousand spirits, all like stars, countless in number, ascending into the golden tower and jade chamber. He visualizes his heart like a great fire pearl, celestial flames blazing. The fire pearl holds a dewdrop in its mouth, which drips onto the true person’s body, drawing all the spirits to enter through his mouth into the pearl’s inner tower, where they recite scriptures.

The secret incantation:
Cinnabar Origin, Cinnabar Palace,
merge with the hundred spirits.
Three times; pinch the *wǔ* position.

Manifesting the Four Numinous Beasts:
The Azure Dragon, Mèngzhāng; pinch *yín*, *jiǎ-yín*. Visualize the liver’s blue *qi* emerging from the left eye as an azure dragon, attending to his left. The Azure Dragon Lord holds a dragon banner in one hand and wields a sword in the other, standing beside the azure dragon.

The White Tiger, Jiānbīng; pinch the *shēn* position and *jiǎ-shēn*.

He visualizes the white *qi* within his lungs emerging from his nose as a white tiger, attending to his right. The White Tiger Lord wields a sword in one hand and holds a tiger banner in the other, standing beside the white tiger.

Above, the Vermilion Phoenix of Numinous Radiance; pinch the *wǔ* position and *jiǎ-wǔ*. He visualizes the red *qi* within his heart emerging from his mouth as a vermilion phoenix, spitting fire from its beak and flapping its wings above his head.

Below, the Dark Warrior Holding Brightness; pinch the *zǐ* position and *jiǎ-zǐ*. He visualizes the black *qi* within his kidneys emerging from his left ear as the Dark Warrior, stationed behind him.

He visualizes a lion emerging from below his navel, roaring before him. Two white cranes emerge from the Six Harmonies Palace, flying in crossing patterns above his shoulders. His hands move from *xū* to *chén*.

Secret incantation:
□□□□□□□.
Celestial spirits flourish in their nodes,
may they guard my long life.
The Supreme Mystery’s One,
protects the true form.
The spirit lords of the five viscera,
each ensure peace and tranquility.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

The Three Terraces give me birth at *sì*; the Three Terraces nurture me at *wǔ*; the Three Terraces protect me at *wèi*. Next, pinch the Dipper and recite:
The stalwart *kuí* and *gāng* of *chén* and *xū* enter the Central Palace to seize.
The *kuí* and *gāng* of *chén* and *xū* enter the Central Palace to seize.
*Jiǎ-chén* and *jiǎ-xū* enter the Central Palace.

Next recite:
Heaven shines bright, earth spirits glow.
I am the summoning envoy,
born before heaven and earth.
I act as heaven and earth’s messenger,
standing as heaven and earth’s sentinel.
Disasters and harm meet self-destruction,
fortune and blessings arise of themselves.
Not only do I restrain tigers and wolves,
I can also shatter the five weapons.
Divine dragons dare not display their power,
spirit ghosts dare not exercise their numen.
Point at mountains and they crumble,
point at seas and they dry up,
point at stones and they split,
point at sun and moon and they shine together.
Wherever I walk, sit, lie, or stand,
ten thousand soldiers always follow.
Wherever my hand points,
wind, fire, lightning, and radiance arise.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

The incantation complete, cross his hands, pinch the Yin-Yang Dipper, and flick upward. He visualizes the altar suffused with resplendent golden light, illuminating the ten directions.

Incantation:
The Northern Dipper lofty and proud,
the Dipper’s handle radiates might.
Strike mountains and they split,
strike seas and they dry up.
Malevolent spirits and evil ghosts,
who dares stand before me?
Those who follow the *gāng* live,
those who oppose it perish.
Wherever my body goes,
misfortune is forever severed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Standing evenly, he knocks his teeth together three times. Next, he pinches the Mudra of the Original Master at the *yín* position and secretly recites:
Open the Gate of Heaven, close the Earth’s Door at *hài*; leave the Human Gate at *xùn*, block the Ghost Road at *kūn*. *Yín* pierces the ghost’s heart, *chén* crosses *xū* to rupture the ghost’s belly, *shēn* crosses *yín* to form the Golden Beam, *yǒu* crosses *mǎo* to erect the Jade Pillar. *Wǔ* descends straight to *chǒu*, encircling the Four Mountains; the thumb traces the four fingers’ tips to invert the Five Peaks; the thumb traces from the second finger’s tip across the four fingers’ backs to conceal; pinch the second finger’s third joint, gather the *gāng* *qi*, from *xū* pinch to *chén*, reciting □□□□□□□.

Form the Dipper Mudra: pinch the middle joint of the four fingers, the little finger bent over the roots of the four fingers, the four fingers bent into the palm—ten thousand evils submit, disasters self-destruct. The *shā* mudra at the left side of the middle finger’s second joint.

Next recite the incantation:
I receive the Heart-Seal Treasure of the Celestial Master,
naturally bestowed, penetrating the hidden and reaching the dark,
ascending to pervade the Grotto-Heavens.
I walk the Yu Steps, attain the Dao and become immortal,
the Three Hun assist and guard,
the Seven Po follow and move,
neither exiting nor entering,
forever preserving celestial years.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Next, pinch the Mudra of the Original Destiny at the *hài* position and secretly recite the incantation:
Three Hun Lads,
Seven Po Generals,
follow me in pacing the Dipper,
wishing to cross the numinous barrier.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Step back, gather the *gāng* *qi* to suffuse the altar. The left hand forms the Dipper Seal, the right hand the Sword Mudra.

Secretly recite:
Reverently summon the General of Establishing the *Gāng*,
the General of Raising the *Gāng*,
the General of Releasing the *Gāng*,
hasten to raise the *gāng* for me.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Reverently summon the General of Raising the Dipper,
the General of Releasing the Dipper,
the General of Casting the Dipper,
hasten to pace the Dipper for me.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

He visualizes the Three Generals of the *Gāng* emerging from the Earth’s Door, wearing blue headscarves and crimson robes, riding fiery clouds. The Three Generals of the Dipper emerge from the Gate of Heaven, wearing blue headscarves and white robes, within yellow clouds. The Generals of the *Gāng* array the Southern Dipper from the Gate of Heaven to the Three Terraces and return. The Generals of the Dipper array the Northern Dipper from the Earth’s Door to the Three Terraces and circle back. The Six Generals cross at the Three Terraces, merging into Three Generals, clad in blue, yellow, and white, each holding a star of the Three Terraces, riding the Three Terraces to illuminate the altar.

Next, facing south, he recites:
Reverently invite the Nine Phoenixes Breaking Filth Perfected,
the Great General of Burning Filth,
the Great General of Removing Filth,
descend upon the ritual altar,
dissolve and remove all defilements.

He visualizes a perfected one from the south, clad in vermilion, riding a nine-headed phoenix, flying to the altar and spewing fire to burn away all filth completely.

The *Gāng* of the Nine Phoenixes Breaking Filth:
The *Huōluò* Yin Dipper.

The incantation states:
The Dipper’s essence wondrous—twelve celestial stems,
Riding the Celestial *Gāng*, martial might arrayed.
Qi drifts and sways like floating clouds,
Nine transformations stir, ascending to align with Heaven.
The six pitch-pipes unite, upholding *jiǎ* and *yǐ*,
Treading *Tiānyīng*, pacing *Tiānrèn*,
Embracing *Tiānzhù*, cradling *Tiānxīn*,
Henceforth crossing to mount *Tiānqín*,
Leaning on *Tiānfǔ*, gazing toward *Tiānchōng*,
Entering *Tiānnèi*, emerging as *Tiānpéng*.
Wherever the Dipper spirits traverse,
May they lend their numinous radiance,
Aid my great Dao,
Establish the upright and expel the perverse,
And grant my heart’s spirit.
After one chant, pace the six hours,
Emerging from profound obscurity—thousands upon ten thousands of years.

Swift as the Primordial Dipper’s pace, by command and ordinance!

*Huōluò* Yang Dipper

The incantation states:
I enter *Tiānnèi* from *Tiānpéng*,
Turning to return, meeting *Tiānchōng* as *Tiānfǔ* retreats.
Entering *Tiānqín* to face the heart,
Passing *Tiānzhù* to convene with *Tiānrèn* and *Tiānyīng*.
The human path opens, the ghostly path seals,
All myriad evils and defilements withdraw.

The divine marshal of this talisman bears the surname Yiqi and the given name Yanqing. He stands three *cun* tall, barefoot, with unbound hair, clad in crimson robes, and wields a vajra hammer. He can enter the human abdomen to cure illness and seize evil, causing the afflicted to vomit or purge blue or yellow water, bringing immediate relief.

Whenever *sui*-spirits cause illness, inducing abdominal pain, frenzied wandering, locked jaw, or muteness—or when assailed by headless, deaf, or mute ghosts—inscribe this talisman, call his name, and bid him enter the abdomen to capture and expel the spirit at once.

**Talisman for Treating *Husun* Bone**
**Incantation:**

*Ti!*
*Jili tata jili chi she!*

With one breath, recite seven times.

For this method, first prepare sesame oil. Heat a needle until red-hot, then let it cool. Next, sift fine chaff ash and spread it upon a table. Have the child sit facing the ash, extending one hand—left for boys, right for girls—and press the palm into the ash. Before imprinting, first examine the child’s middle finger pulse. Then, with the previously heated needle, pierce the child’s middle joint to a depth of two *fen*, withdraw it, and observe the drop of toxic fluid that emerges. If it clings to the hand with a thread-like strand, watery and red in hue, it is female; if white, it is male. Take a five-colored thread, roughly three *chi* in length, and pass it through the incense burner’s smoke. Visualize the Fire-Bell General amidst flames above, bell in left hand and fire-rope in right. Envision the general casting down the five-colored thread, which transforms into an iron chain. After a moment, encircle the child’s neck with the chain and bind it securely, beginning the knot at the child’s *gu men*. Next, burn the aforementioned talisman and place nine moxa cones upon the handprint in the ash, specifically at the middle joint of the middle finger where the imprint was made. Light a sesame oil lamp and apply seven moxa cauterizations. With each cauterization, recite once:

*[...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...]*
All fox-spirits and myriad illnesses vanish.

Grasp the child’s bound hand and press it into the ash at the *dou sha* position. Then recite:

*[...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...]*
Draw the Fire-Bell General’s fiery *qi* and blow it into the moxa point. Utter the word *she* once, then seven times in total. Press the moxa ash into the child’s middle finger at the needle point. The illness will be cured at once.

**Talisman for Treating Malaria**
The ghosts of the five directions’ cold-malaria—what are they but the essences of the five *qi*? Heaven’s surname is Zhang; Earth’s, Huang. All things contain essence, and the *qi* of the Great Yang propels the malaria ghosts, who come at dawn and depart at dusk without cause. Capture and seize them, hastening their death!

*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

In the southern quarter lies a pool; within the pool, water; within the water, a fish with three heads and nine tails. It does not consume the five grains of the human realm—only malaria ghosts.

The execution writ employs the *qi* of the Three Lights, infused into the talisman.

The Six Jia and Six Ding spirits swiftly drive the mountains to crush them.

**Incantation:**
*Om...*

**Incantation:**

**Talisman for Dispelling Heat**
Press [the designated acupoints] with the Dipper’s alignment. Water and fire achieve harmony, instantly granting spiritual efficacy. Rub the needle with black ink, invoking the Black Spirit Official Lord. Capture the *qi* of the Yin-Yang Dipper and infuse it.

*Flaming fire flies ten thousand miles—swiftly manifest your true form! Hear now the summons: hasten to descend! Swiftly, swiftly—fly your soul across the sea, seize at once!*

**Incantation:**
The Northern Emperor decrees: Heaven is Yin, Earth is Yang.
Together we summon the Nine *Qi* Dragon Lords of the Four Seas,
the awe-inspiring Huxie,
the Iron-Faced General,
Zi Wu Zi Lian,
Zi Hong Zi Yuan,
the River Deities—capture!
The Jiang, the He, the Huai, the Ji—capture!

Visualize this talisman as the vast waters of rivers and seas, where Heaven and Earth become a single ocean. Imagine the patient’s spirit sinking into the water, then enclose them within it.

**Talisman for Dispelling Pestilent Heat**
Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper across six paths. Envision a wheel of fire entering the abdomen, then seal it with the *qi* of Great Yin, slaying *qi*, Golden Light *qi*, Jade Seal, and Jade *qi*.
Recite the Heavenly Peng incantation to dispatch it.

Infuse the talisman with the green *qi* of the Mao trigram, then recite:
*Heaven shines bright, Earth darkens deep.*
Imperial Heaven’s daughter, [Name]’s mother, carries the Six Jia in her womb and devoutly prays.
We humbly beseech the Six Jia Generals and Six Jia Lads to descend,

Twenty-four repetitions.

**Talisman for Hastening Birth and Unlocking the Bones**
Incantation:

*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

**Mysterious Woman’s Talisman for Hastening Birth**
Incantation:

Command:
*Descend at once!*

Clasp the Dipper mudra and issue the Wu trigram.

The right talisman is inscribed on yellow paper.
Recite: *The Great Sage Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper can resolve the perils of childbirth.*
Then administer with a decoction of *bai cao shuang* and *bai zhi*.
Alternatively, a decoction of mallow seeds, vegetable seeds, or radish seeds may be used to send it down.

Next, recite the incantation:
*Oṃ.*

*Ōṃ... [graphemes indistinct]... svāhā. Summon!*

**Childbirth-Delivery Talisman**
*Incantation:*
Six Ding spirit-generals,
Six Jia spirit-generals,
Hastening-Birth Lads,
Talisman-Delivery Lads,
Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens,
Officer-generals and spirit-soldiers—
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden,
Lads, descend at once!
Dragon banners and elephant pennants
advance to lead the way;
a million troops of Azure Dragons attend her.
Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother
charge forward to strike;
the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens departs the cosmos.
A thousand myriad soldiers and horses
resound through the world;
with a single roar, they pierce Heaven’s Gate.
The sixty Jia-Zi cycles
all surge forth together;
Six Ding and Six Jia rush forward.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

**Hastening-Birth Talisman**
Whenever inscribing this talisman, first compose the spirit and settle the mind, then knock the teeth and secretly invoke:
*Reverently summon the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens, the Nine Heavens’ Supervisor of Births, the Great Divine of the Hastening-Birth Bureau, the Holy Mother Who Guards the Form, and the spirit-officers of hastening birth. Six Jia and Six Ding, Talisman-Delivery Lads, Hastening-Birth Lads, and all others.*
Once the intention is stated, then take up the brush to inscribe the talisman—none shall fail to respond.

**Supervisor of Births’ Transformative Birth Talisman**
*Incantation:*
Great Divine Supervisor of Births,
spirit who oversees life—
entrusted with this body,
transformed into this form.
Supervising-Birth Lads,
Seven Po Lords,
Hastening-Birth Jade Maidens,
spirits who descend the po souls.
By the August One’s decree,
save and protect all beings.
Sever demonic essences,
hasten birth with all speed.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on yellow silk. Draw the southern qi, form the Chen trigram mudra, recite the above incantation again, and complete the inscription. For all hastened births, first use four or five of these talismans, along with the Karmic Debt-Resolving Talisman, in the birthing chamber. Burn each with spirit-money and spirit-horses; at the talisman’s rising, birth will occur.

**Hastening-Birth and Karmic Debt-Resolving Talisman**
Inscribe any general’s name at will within the talisman:
*Greedy, Mighty, Prosperous, Civil, Martial, Destructive...*
*[graphemes indistinct]*
*Dispatch General [Name] to swiftly hasten birth and resolve the karmic debts of [Person’s Name], that all obstructions dissolve and departure proceed without hindrance.*

**Untying the Sash**
Should the birthing woman, in this or a past life, bear any karmic debts or be afflicted by malevolent spirits or ghosts clinging to her liver and heart, refusing to descend—lest they intend to harm her life—now summon General [Name] to urgently sever the fetal knots, swiftly untangle limbs, and promptly part the birth.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the August One’s statutes and ordinances!*

*Incantation:*
Wind and thunder descend,
thunderbolts clash and resound.

Vast are the divine powers, radiant the light of sun and moon.
Seize and subdue malevolent ghosts, that they may never again assail.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and ordinances!

Once the talisman on the right is completed and the incantation recited, take the garment from the woman’s body, fold it nine times, and scatter it away, envisioning it falling.

**Passing the Command Talisman for Hastening Birth**
I invoke the Nine Elder Immortals of the Divine Capital, whose light of sun and moon shines universally. With jade fingers forming sacred signs, I draw the eastern qi.
Mighty demon-quelling gods, protect all living beings.
The Jade Emperor decrees: sever evil and safeguard life.
The Great Sage of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes dissolves the perils of childbirth.
*[graphemes indistinct]*
Recite again the Jade Edict and intone the command incantation:
Heaven has four seasons, earth has five phases.
The Six Jia spirits guard life, the Six Ding spirits protect it.
Hair and body are whole, the form is complete.
Mother and child part in birth, the Dao of Heaven flows smoothly.
The August One cherishes life—hasten to obey.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and ordinances of the Birth-Supervising Great Emperor!

When inscribing the talisman, focus solely on summoning a marshal into the sign. Write only the character for "horse," ensuring it is precise and reverent, never careless or cursive. If the horse’s four legs appear nimble, the talisman is efficacious. Take utmost care lest the birthing woman suffer misfortune—prudence is paramount.
Once the talisman is complete, have her swallow it with downstream water. If carrying the talisman, place it on the left for a boy, on the right for a girl. Observe the stroke’s exit: a single trail signifies a boy, a double trail a girl.

**Talisman for Dispelling Female Pollution and Purifying the Body**
To dispel female pollution, inscribe this talisman, burn it to ash, face southeast, draw qi, and blow it into the body—greatly efficacious.

**Commander-in-Chief Marshal Wuji of Song.** Green-faced, three-eyed, three-headed, six-armed, clad in golden armor, wielding a spear.

**Vice-Commander Marshal Xu Ji.** The Five Directions’ Pursuit-and-Capture Marshal Zhao Gongming. In his transformed aspect: green-faced, golden-armored, with fangs bared, a mirror helm, and spear in hand.

**Marshal Chen, the Great Exorcist.** **Marshal Liu, the Great Ghost-Burner.** **Marshal Gong, the Great Beheader, whose blade drips blood.**

The Six Ding and Six Jia spirits—seizers, binders, shacklers, and torturers—along with the Wind-Bearing True Yin, fierce clerks, and the entire host of interrogators and inquisitors.

**Purification Incantation**
Within the cavern, emptiness and mystery; radiant, the Great Primordial.
The mighty spirits of the eight directions empower me by nature.
By the talismanic command of the Numinous Treasure, I proclaim to the Nine Heavens.
*Qianluo Danna*, the cavern’s might and the Great Mystery’s power—
Slay demons, bind evil, and slaughter ten thousand ghosts.

The **Central Mountain Divine Incantation**, the Jade Text of the Primordial Beginning.
Recite once: banish ghosts and prolong life.
Traverse the Five Peaks; the Eight Seas hear and know.
The Demon Kings bow their heads, guarding my hall.
Baneful filth disperses; the Dao’s qi endures forever.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

When performing this ritual, first sweep and purify the afflicted person’s chamber. Then burn the talisman upon the ground, envisioning the fire’s *qi* rising. With a sword, trace an empty well-character (井) upon the earth, reciting:

*First stroke: Heaven is cleansed,*
*Second stroke: Earth is pacified,*
*Third stroke: Humans attain longevity,*
*Fourth stroke: The Fire Prison is formed.*

With the left hand, invoke the Yin Dipper and blow its essence upon the ground. With the right hand, circulate the *qi* (○), envisioning a golden well sinking ten thousand *zhang* deep and wide into the earth. Next, scatter ashes upon the ground and recite the **Incantation to Consecrate the Ash Altar**:

*Consecrate this pure ash altar, radiant and resplendently clear.*
*Above, it opens the Three Heavens; below, it illuminates the Three Paths’ rifts.*
*The hells manifest in jagged peaks; the Pass of Mount Luo stands sealed.*
*Each mote of dust gleams and flickers; every generation suffers chills and fevers.*
*A single grasp spans the sand-realm; the four directions are all pierced through.*
*By this, the Heavenly Prison is formed, and all banners and standards appear.*
*Celestial immortals and spirits, upon seeing it, fall into dismay.*
*All lawless ghosts are seized without pause, captured forever without return.*
*Bound within the Iron Mountain’s winding passes.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Statutes and Ordinances of the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole!*

Next, inscribe the **Demon-Quelling Diagram** and the **Execution Script**. Then, light the lamp and inhale a mouthful of southern *qi*. Invoke the Dipper of the South and recite the **Incantation to the Star Lord of Fire Virtue**:

*Fierce horns bristle like dragon and phoenix; awe-inspiring radiance rebukes the ten directions.*
*Cinnabar *gang* illumines the five watches of night; vermilion flames blaze along the three edges.*
*Essence and clarity align with the true *qi*; swords and halberds gleam with martial authority.*
*Rushing comets retreat; wayward stars dare not advance.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as commanded by the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole!*

Next, recite the **Incantation for Encircling the Prison with Lamplight**:

*Fire blazes, wind races—transformed into a prison courtyard.*
*Serpents coil, tigers prowl; thunder roars and lightning flashes.*
*Earth darkens, Heaven dims; the cosmos is overturned.*
*Heavenly nets and earthly snares, swords and halberds encircle all.*
*The Fire Prison’s wardens, appear swiftly!*
*Let the ghosts below now receive Heaven’s decree.*
*By the Emperor’s command, act without delay!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole!*

Then, burn the remaining embers beneath the afflicted person’s written petition. Take up the mirror and recite the incantation:

*Ancient mirror, reveal the thousand-year-old ghost; bright lamp, burn away the ten-thousand-year-old evil.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

Direct the Dipper’s execution *qi* onto the mirror. Envision within the southern fire-clouds a palace hall, its red plaque inscribed in gold with the words *Southern Court Fire Prison*. Draw it in with a breath and blow it onto the altar. See the Fire Prison vast and boundless, its chief and deputy generals, all officials and soldiers, led by the Pacifying General, seizing ghosts and delivering them to the prison to execute the Fire Decree. Envision within the prison a bridge of fire *qi* extending directly into the afflicted person’s ( ). With the right hand, form the sword mudra as the bridge; with the left, hold the lamp’s embers and recite the incantation. The master invokes the Southern Dipper, stepping the Dipper’s *gang* to exit the prison. Proclaim:

*Burning incense, I once more summon the Chief General [Name], along with all officials and generals of the Dharma host.*
*Hearing this summons, hasten swiftly to the altar.*

State the purpose. Burn the **Prison-Immolating Talisman** within the prison. Invoke the Yin Dipper, face the *xun* direction, and envision all generals of the ritual descending. Recite the **Dispatching Incantation**:

*Great Thunder of the Primordial Sky, lightning shakes the void.*
*Three million blades and soldiers, flames scatter within the prison city.*
*Should any defy my command, the Emperor will not tolerate it.*
*Seize them beneath the *Kuigang*; bestow upon them the Pure and Sharp Blade.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Emperor’s statutes and ordinances!*

Next, invoke the Yin Dipper once more, sealing the prison. Envision the celestial generals standing guard at the prison gate. Recite the **Summoning Incantation**:

*Reverently summon the Great Black Spirit of Flying Heaven, who commands flying thunder and wields lightning to seal the prison gate.*
*The Perfected of the Three Heavens and the Heavenly Ding, with me, bind and interrogate the guilty.*
*The officials and soldiers of this altar assist the Dharma in their inquiry, fulfilling their duty to save living beings in the world.*
*Should any dare resist or refuse, seize them and deliver them to the Fire Prison to be annihilated.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as commanded by the Great Emperor of the South!*

Upon completing the incantation, form a sealing mudra in the void, securing the prison gate. Perform the Six Methods:

*Open the Gate of Heaven, close the Door of Earth;*
*Leave the Gate of Man open, block the Ghost Road.*
*Lay the Golden Beam horizontally, erect the Jade Pillar;*
*Pierce the ghost’s heart, rupture the ghost’s belly.*
*Encompass the Four Mountains, trace the Five Peaks;*
*Gather the *gang* *qi*, grasp the Dipper’s mudra.*
*All demons submit, ghosts self-destruct.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Statutes and Ordinances of the Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Pole!*

**Nine Provinces’ *Gang***
Envision Heaven and Earth overturned, invoking the *gang* into the prison. Recite the incantation:

*Jizhou, the first *kan*; Li, the ninth, in the south;*
*Left, Qingzhou, the third; right, Liangzhou, the seventh.*
*Qian, the sixth, Yongzhou; Xun, the fourth, Xuxiang.*
*Kun, the second, Xingzhou; Gen, the eighth, Yanzhou.*
*Center, the fifth, Yuzhou—no evil can hide.*
*Wind races, thunder roars, lightning flashes.*
*Ghosts of the Three Realms, seize them beneath the *Kuigang*!*
*Compress the Nine Provinces into one province, one province into one county,*
*One county into one village, one village into one hamlet, one hamlet into my palm.*
*Compress Heaven into Earth, Earth into Heaven;*
*East into West, West into East;*
*South into North, North into South;*
*Above into Below, Below into Above;*
*All four directions and above and below, compressed into the space of a square inch.*
*Wind rages, rain pours, thunder and lightning roar.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

Again, employ the **Halo Dipper’s *Gang*** to hasten the process. If the prison’s traces remain unclear, use the **Execution Diagram** and draw in northern *qi* to blow upon it.

**Locking Method**
*Copper head, iron feet, fire eyes, golden pupils.*
*Envoys of the Three Officials, lock down the demonic essence.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

To the right, carve a **Yin Dipper** formation. At the site of *sha qi*, when the **Celestial Stem** manifests, visualize the red radiance of the characters **□植**, draw it in, and blow it to envelop the prison. Silently visualize it appearing once, then recite the prison incantation:

*Divine Might, Divine Might,*
*demonic forms obliterated.*
*I now dissolve the prison,*
*later to establish communion with the numinous.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

Next, spray a mouthful of water and recite the incantation:

*Limpid waters,*
*blossoming with the essence of sun and moon.*
*Within lies the Northern Dipper,*
*internally aligned with the Three Terraces.*
*Sacred water sprayed,*
*misfortune departs, fortune arrives.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

After reciting the above incantation, have someone sweep the ashes out the door. The practitioner forms the **Sword Mudra**, and outside the door, traces an empty **"Well" character** in the air, declaring:

*One stroke forms a river,*
*two strokes form a stream,*
*three strokes, the Yellow River flows backward,*
*four strokes, a hundred ghosts lose their path.*
*The heavens blur,*
*the earth blurs,*
*a hundred ghosts forget their coming,*
*ten thousand ghosts forget their going.*

Again, silently circulate the **○**, grasp the **Dipper Mudra**, and, following the previous six methods, offer prayers and send them forth.

**Burning the Ghost-Exorcising Talisman with Lamp Wick Ashes**
*Upper Terrace: Empty Essence*
*Middle Terrace: Sixfold Purity*
*Lower Terrace: Curved Life*
*Barbs bristle, dragon and phoenix wield awe-inspiring might,*
*commanding the ten directions with the Crimson Stem’s radiance.*
*At midnight, the vermilion flames blaze,*
*three edges gleam with luminous clarity.*
*The talisman of upright qi, the sword and halberd,*
*flash with martial authority, seizing and annihilating.*
*Comets and baleful stars dare not approach—*
*draw in the fire qi!*

*Bing Ding, Bing Ding,*

*arise with great fire to burn, refine, and slay demonic spirits!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as commanded by the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole!*

**Incantation:**
*Oṃ, Hui Wei, as decreed by the Dipper, Vi□ Ya Emperor, seize!*
*Ah! Southern qi.*

Once the talisman is complete, visualize the **Marshal Song Wuji**: green-faced, three-headed, six-armed, his body wreathed in flames, wielding a fire spear, fire lasso, fire sword, and fire bell, riding a fire cloud into the talisman. Then, infuse it with *sha qi* and press it upon the character for "ghost."

**Seizing Talisman**
This talisman is used in three copies. If the characters "fire prison" are present, it is employed at the initial establishment. If the characters "urgent seizure" are added, it is used for dispatching. If the character "lock" is added, it is used within the **Locking Method**.

**Golden Net, Iron Web to Enclose and Capture Demonic Spirits**
*Forests and groves, trees and woods—search meticulously!*
*Upper Prime: Heavenly Official, swiftly seize the spirits!*
*Middle Prime: Earthly Official, swiftly seize the ghosts!*
*Lower Prime: Water Official, swiftly seize the demons!*
*Officers and soldiers of this altar,*
*swiftly apprehend the source of calamity!*
*All fifteen kinds of malevolent ghosts—*
*heads severed, feet cut off—*
*swiftly seize them at their root, swiftly act!*

**The Dao Possesses a Spirit**
Named **Heavenly Soldier**, who receives the mandate of the Nine Heavens, serves the Three Clarities, and roams the world to slay and subdue demonic spirits. With one command, the Five Peaks crumble; bound are the hordes of demons. Beheaded are the ghostly soldiers by the thousands; their forms severed by the tens of thousands. Those who dare resist in Fengdu are doomed; the wicked perish, the virtuous thrive. The Six Heavens’ sunken souls are recorded one by one. Those who defy me are diminished; those who obey me prosper. Flying and roaming, disaster and *sha*—who dares alter the netherworld? Swiftly, swiftly, carve a **Yin Dipper** formation, break open the Xun gate, and behold Marshal Zhao wielding his fire spear entering the talisman!

**Commanding the Dharma Marshal Zhao Gongming**
*Command the Dharma to drive forth the ghost,*
*reveal its true form!*
*The Heavenly Emperor releases the chapter,*
*adorned with the Celestial Stem of the Five Directions.*
*Why do malevolent ghosts not perish?*
*With a single inhalation of the Flying Immortal,*
*ten thousand ghosts vanish without a trace.*
*Great Sage of the Celestial Stem,*
*Oṃ Hūṃ Hāṃ Da Lī, seize!*
*Draw the Stem’s qi into the talisman.*

On yang days: *Greed, Giant, Prosperity, Literature, Integrity, Military, Ruin, Submission*—from top to bottom.
On yin days: *□□□□□□□*—from bottom to top.

**Ancient Mirror to Reveal Millennial Ghosts**
**Bright Lamp to Burn and Slay Ten-Thousand-Year Demons**
Next, visualize within the fire clouds of the southern quadrant a palace with a red plaque inscribed in gold: **"Southern Court Fire Prison."** Draw it in and blow it to spread across the altar. Envision the fire prison vast and boundless, with each general seizing ghosts and escorting them to the fire prison. Within the prison, visualize a bridge of fire qi extending directly to the sickbed, then blow the fire qi toward it.

*Red apricot stockings, ink-black Numinous Treasure,*
*copper head, iron feet, fire eyes, golden pupils.*
*Envoys of the Three Officials, lock down the demonic essence.*
*Thunder and Fire Prison Dharma!*

Visualize a golden well in the earth, vast and ten thousand *zhang* deep. Recite the incantation and perform the activation:

**Incantation:**
*"True essence of the Great Yang, fire radiance and fire essence.
Three-Eyed General, fire-flourishing Crow Soldiers.
Fire-Chariot General, Song Wuji of Yan.
*Chisheche*, seize and convey!"*

Light incense and reverently summon the King of the Golden Fire Wheel of the Red Ramie Land in the Southern Quadrant, Song Wuji, along with his two deputy generals, to search and seize all ghostly thieves, demonic spirits, *wangliang*, and malevolent entities within the person’s body—burning gods into juice and refining ghosts into ash.

Form the thunder mudra and draw in the killing *qi*.

Next, recite the **Expulsion and Seizure Incantation:**
*"Envoys of the Five Thunders, Black Capital Crimson Emperor.
Celestial spirits and earthly deities, drive and seize the ghosts.
Vigorous warriors and exalted ministers, compel the ghosts to manifest their traces.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*"*

*"Fire Prison, numinous and potent, the Celestial Master’s decree is enacted.
Prison-constructing warriors, execute the command with solemn might.
Seize and restrain the demonic ghosts—show no leniency!
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*"*

Light incense and summon again all the generals and officers of the various bureaus to swiftly seize and capture headless, footless, mountain *xiaos*, stone spirits, earthen and wooden demons, foxes with single legs, and the fifteen kinds of unorthodox, base malevolence. Bind them into the Fire Prison, forcing them to manifest clearly without delay—execute this swiftly!

Next, recite:
*"By decree, the Dharma General Zhao Gongming—by decree, drive the ghosts to appear in form!
*Om-nye* □.
*Om-nye* □."*

*"Om* □□.
*Om* □□ *she* (seize).

**Prison-Constructing Incantation**
The Fire Prison is built—lock and seal the demonic spirits!
Scribes and interrogating officers, investigate the causes of their crimes.
Seize swiftly, restrain without pause—no delay or disobedience allowed!

Generals and officers of Fengdu, stewards of mountains and rivers,
hear the summons and arrive at once, respond to the call and manifest numinously.
Drive the ghosts to appear in form—swiftly reveal their shapes!
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*

The Four Great Divine Continents’ Fire Generals,
the blazing flame spirits of the Great Yang,

with me, swiftly establish numinous communion!

Hasten to drive the demonic ghosts,
to the prison where they manifest in form.
Vast fire blazes, vast fire flows,
the *Tiwu* script’s mighty fire punishment follows the talisman to reveal their names.
Heaven and earth glow crimson, sun and moon dim.

*Om-dali-she* (seize).

Draw the *Gang* qi into myself and receive the Southern Culmen Great Emperor’s decree to slay ghosts.
Harness the slaying qi, form the Thunder Formation.

In all practices, when releasing ghosts or sentencing them to prison,
one must ride the *Gang* qi, transform into the Celestial *Gang*,
wield the sword, and lead the various generals to encircle them front and back—
only then proceed to sentence them by direction.

Next, recite the *Great Majestic Virtue Mantra* and apply [the talisman]. *Oṃ. Hūṃ hūṃ. Trāṇa hāna yán qián yí lì.*

Nine Heavens’ Supreme Fire Division, *Boundless Great Majestic Virtue Spirit-King*, command the Nine Heavens’ Great Thunderfire to arise—flying fire, rushing fire, molten-metal-hurling fire, Seven Stars’ thunderclap fire, raging thunder’s blazing fire. The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Fire King, sternly mounted upon *kuilong*, riding a flying tiger, lion and white *ze*, *bìngxiù* qilin, fire camels, fire elephants, fire eagles, fire hawks, fire beasts of ten thousand grasses, copper-headed and iron-faced, a million spirit soldiers, Five Emperors’ ritual blades, Four Heavens’ roving patrols, the Emperor’s Bell shaking, all demonic paths startled.

Grotto-heavens and blessed lands, mountains and rivers, dark nether realms, city gods and earth spirits—all unruly ghosts and gods—mountains collapse, trees shatter, the hundred grains seethe and boil. What ghost dares resist? Those who do not submit shall be compelled to compliance.

The Giant-Mouthed Wind King, Fire Lads and Fire Maidens, fire dragons and fire horses descend from Heaven. *Bing*-*Ding* Generals surge forth from the earth. Fire clouds spread *qi*; eight dragons gallop. The Five Generals of the Supreme Heaven devour thunder and roar. Flying sand and rolling stones, uprooting trees and displacing roots. The wind axle turns left; the fire chariot spins right. Illuminating the Three Realms, transforming into a crimson city. Beneath the Eight Trigrams’ Dipper, the Thunder Division encircles. Enforce the statutes, unleash Heaven’s might. Raging flames and fierce winds, thunderclaps resounding. Ghostly spirits who witness this plunge ten thousand *zhang* into the earth, reduced to flying ash. Ancient trees and malevolent shrines become eternal dust and mud.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Thunderfire Division’s Boundless Great Majestic Virtue Spirit-King, Fire-Thunder-Wind-Cloud command!*

Upon completing the incantation, add the final seven characters, and visualize a fire wheel from the South entering the talisman: □□□□□□□. Clasp the *yin*-*wu* Dipper, draw in the *sha* *qi*, and proceed.

With one stroke, summon *Xin Hanchen*.
Three Divisions’ Generals—*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*
Encircle the world, hunt ghostly bandits. The Iron-Faced General shows no mercy.

**Commanding Incantation**
I receive the true *qi* of the Five Thunders, the might of the Lightning Mother. Entering, I heal illness and preserve life; departing, I dispel misfortune and expel deviance. *By the Supreme Statutes!* Fierce officials with silver fangs, guard the true *qi*, purge all malevolent deviance. *Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*

Next, recite the **Encircling Hell Mantra**:
Fire blazes, wind races, transforming into a prison courtyard.
Snakes coil, tigers prowl, flying thunder and flashing lightning.
Earth darkens, Heaven dims; the cosmos alters.
Heavenly nets and earthly snares, blades and halberds spread everywhere.
The Fire Prison’s overseers swiftly manifest.
Command the imprisoned ghosts to receive Heaven’s decree.
*Proceed! Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!*

**METHOD FOR PURSUING THE HUN-SOUL**
There are four kinds of hun-pursuit, each with its own method:
1. Lost hun
2. Bewildered hun
3. Seized hun
4. Hun taken by ghosts

**First: Symptoms of the Lost Hun**
Frequent wandering dreams, forgetfulness upon waking, and subsequent illness—pursue with the Four Upright Hun-Pursuit Method, and administer the Four Upright Hun-Pacifying Talisman and Command.

**FOUR UPRIGHT HUN-PURSUIT METHOD**
Commander-in-Chief and Generals,
lead the host of spirits.
Soaring above and below,
instantly pursue the wandering hun.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command.*

Draw qi from Heaven’s Gate and blow it onto the patient’s clothing. Have a family member stand in the southeast and call the patient’s childhood name three times, then apply the qi directly to their flesh. Administer the Hun-Pacifying Talisman thereafter.

**FOUR UPRIGHT HUN-PACIFYING TALISMAN**
Celestial Lord Tianyi,
by decree pacifies the hun.
Year’s Upright, Month’s Upright,
Day’s Upright, Hour’s Upright—
pacify the seven po and guard the three hun.

This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper. When the patient appears sorrowful and disconsolate, as if having lost something, this indicates a lost hun. If they have dreamed of wandering but cannot recall the way back, first summon the hun with the Northern Thearch’s Hun-Attracting Incense, then administer the Hun-Pacifying Talisman.

**NORTHERN THEARCH’S HUN-ATTRACTING INCENSE INCANTATION**
Clear and pure,
the hun returns to the body.
Thunder comes, lightning enters—
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command.*

For this method, use one piece of incense: boil half in water for the patient to ingest with the talisman, and burn the other half before their bed.

**Second: Symptoms of the Bewildered Hun**
This condition arises when the mind fixates on an object or when the patient is startled by livestock or another person, leading to illness. Treat by burning the Three Realms’ Hun-Attracting Talismans.

**UPPER REALM TALISMAN**
*Incense-Burning Incantation:*
Heavenly Lord Tianyou,
by law and command summon the hun.
Four Upright, execute swiftly—
*Instantly seize and retrieve.*

**MIDDLE REALM TALISMAN**
*Incense-Burning Incantation:*
The Eight Slayers descend,
the Four Upright ascend.
Thunder Duke pursues the hun—
*Swiftly, swiftly, act now.*

**LOWER REALM TALISMAN**
*Incense-Burning Incantation:*
Through dark passes and shadowy paths,
pierce the earth to guide the hun.
The talisman arrives—execute—
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and command.*

All three talismans are inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper and stamped with the Seal of the Great Master of the Capital of Heaven. Recite the incense-burning incantation three times while burning and administering them.

**TALISMAN TO OPEN HEAVEN’S GATE AND SEAL EARTH’S DOOR**
After administering the previous three talismans, administer this one.
*Flying Celestial Swift Hun-Pursuit Messengers open Heaven’s Gate—*
*Lightning-swift, thunder-roaring, Fire Chariot Messengers seal Earth’s Door.*
Four Upright Merit Officers,
Celestial Stem Generals—
pursue the hun to reattach it to the body.
*Swiftly!*
Inscribe in cinnabar on paper and have the patient swallow it.

**Third: Symptoms of the Seized Hun**
When a person is cursed and their hun is seized by spirits, causing sudden death—manifesting as dreams of underworld officials coming to claim them, unconsciousness, and unawareness—this is termed "sudden death illness." Treat by burning the Supreme Lord’s Hun-Seizing Talisman.

**SUPREME LORD’S HUN-SEIZING TALISMAN**
Supreme Clarity Thearch, Jade Thearch, Radiant Thearch,
Supreme Lord decrees: bring peace and life to living beings.
Celestial Stem Venerable Star, Great General, Thunderclap Spirit Messenger—
*Instantly restore the hun.*

Supreme Lord, Supreme Unity, Pure Mystery Numinous Lord,
Cloud-Central Commander-in-Chief,
Two Clouds Flying Cavalry,

Hun-Seizing Thunder Lord—
*Instantly seize.*

Both talismans are inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper and burned at the site of the lightning strike. Administer with Three Lights Talisman Water.

**Fourth: Symptoms of the Hun Taken by Ghosts**
Women often experience strange dreams of intercourse with ghosts, leading to spiritual confusion, dreams of ghosts consuming or wandering, and consequent hun disorder. If left untreated, death occurs within three days. Treat with the Supreme Unity Hun-Attracting Banner.

**METHOD FOR CRAFTING THE SUPREME UNITY HUN-ATTRACTING BANNER**
Use yellow silk or yellow paper, sized according to the patient’s height. Inscribe the Northern Dipper at the top, the patient’s birth name and zodiac sign on the hands, their residence on the feet, and the Supreme Unity Hun-Attracting Talisman on the body. Have the patient lie down for one hour, then burn the banner at the head of their bed.

**SUPREME UNITY HUN-ATTRACTING TALISMAN**
When inscribing this talisman, grasp the Zi trigram with the left hand, draw qi from Heaven’s Gate three times, and blow onto the brush before writing.

**Instructions for Writing the Jade Chapter**
Use one sheet of yellow paper, nine inches high and twelve inches wide, fumigated with incense, and inscribed in cinnabar.
First, knock the teeth nine times.
Then, use five sheets of temple paper money, rolled together.
Place a fragrant altar in the courtyard of the petitioner’s home, and pray according to the heart’s desire, without need for elaborate words.
Burn five parts of gold paper money, or use thick incense in the censer to ignite a fierce flame and consume the talisman.
Afterward, in a quiet room, visualize the divine officers. That very night, a response will be received.
This method may be used even when resources for a grand offering are lacking.
It is suitable for soul retrieval, exorcism, all unclear matters, and severe calamities.

This chapter reaches directly before the Jade Purity. Each chapter may address only one matter, and no more than one chapter may be submitted in a day.
The censer must show flames; act with urgency, and do not delay. No one else may witness this.
During ritual offerings, the chapter may be submitted, but no fellow practitioners may observe.

**Six Heavens’ Flying Ash As-You-Will Spirit-Exiting Secret Memorial Method**
For writing the Crimson Spirit Heart Chapter, use yellow silk, five inches high and twelve inches long, folded into twelve sections like a sutra board, with one character per line in each of the three columns per section.
After writing, burn it together with the Marshal’s Credential Chapter, the Spirit-Rushing Golden Palace Talisman, and the Celestial-Connecting Talisman on the censer before the grotto altar. Then, the ritual master prostrates and presents the chapter according to proper form.

**Incantation for the Talisman-Writing Brush**

[Rank] [Name], your subject, with reverence and awe, prostrates and knocks the head a hundred times, respectfully states:

Your subject now petitions on behalf of the Dao-devoted believer of [such-and-such] village and native place, [Name], who submits this plea: [So-and-so], born in the year, month, day, and hour of [such-and-such], with destiny governed by the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper’s [such-and-such] star. Since [such-and-such] day, this person has contracted an illness, unable to preserve peace, and has filed this petition at your subject’s altar, beseeching a secret memorial be presented.

Your subject deeply fears that through past and present lives, [this person] may have erred in action or intent, accumulating transgressions across the three karmic deeds and six sense faculties. Or perhaps the stars and constellations are inauspicious, fate’s limits perilous; ancestral litigation or spectral summons may entangle them, stubborn spirits bring calamity, or malevolent forces inflict harm—prolonged and unhealed, they have yet to recover.

Humbly beseeching the Celestial Compassion to command the True Bureau of the Dipper’s Pole, dispatching the Three Bureaus of the Thunder Department, the officers and generals of your subject’s received dharma, along with the spirit officials of the Dipper’s lodges and their marshaled troops, to descend as one. Specifically, may they write [this person’s] name to eradicate disaster and peril, capture malevolent ghosts, safeguard against suffering, and augment their years.

Your subject, with reverent temerity, prostrates a hundred times and memorializes the August Heaven, the Most Honored Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal.

Humbly beseeching the Celestial Compassion to grant this petition, swiftly bestowing health and peace, fulfilling the people’s hopes.

Now, within the sacred altar’s precinct, may all be permitted to witness, gazing upward to await the numinous response, the manifest report, and the imperial decree.

Seal the memorial with this talisman alongside the Celestial-Connecting Talisman, and present it in secret practice. Next, visualize the thunderous radiance of the Yu Step before you, vast as a river, directly ascending the path to the Heavenly Gate. The Golden Light, like a golden sash, rises straight to the northwest, its jade-green and golden radiance shimmering across the celestial thoroughfare. First pass through the Breaker, then to Greedy Wolf, and step through Wen Qu to enter and stand at the Heavenly Gate of Return, where the memorial is presented. If encountering overcast or rainy conditions, employ the rain-halting method before proceeding.

Upon completing the presentation, turn back and exit through Upright Integrity, Wu Qu, and the Breaker. When first entering the Breaker, hold the Dipper Seal in the left hand and the Jade Script in the right, stand upright with hands hanging naturally, and enter the Dipper with a composed heart. Then recite the incantation:

The primal destiny descends and gathers
A hundred essences refine the true
Great spirits align in harmony

Visualize the Five Thunder Envoys at my left and right—demons and ghosts flee in concealment
Divine transformation knows no bounds
Yellow clouds envelop the body
Visualize the *qi* from the spleen ascending and coalescing into yellow clouds covering the body, with thunderous radiance and flying fire. The Wu Script blazes forth, envisioning great luminosity

Next, step to Kang Zhen and recite the incantation:

Thunder Lords, Yu’s Steps—
Intertwine with my body.
Luminous spirits emerge as one,
In likeness of the Imperial Lord.
Fiery flames and flying fire
Command and seal the demon gate.
Essences and souls come and go—
Let none escape or flee.
Thunder Lord Envoys,
Thunderbolt Generals,
Wielding axes and spouting fire—
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Next, step to Wen Qu and recite the incantation:

One *qi* of pure truth.
Flowing fire refines the form,
Three souls at the Gate of Life.
Together ascend to the Purple Palace,
Spirits emerge from darkness and obscurity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Flick the mudra toward the body, then strike the teeth three times.
Clasp the hands firmly, close the eyes, and recite the incantation:

Hold the breath, ascend through the Twelve-Story Tower to the Muddy Pellet Palace, release the spirit, and enclose it in golden light—strike the teeth nine times.

Next, recite the incantation:

Spirits depart the Crimson Palace,
Souls leave the Jade Treasury.
Thunder Lords bear the talisman,
Deploying and commanding thunder and rain.
The flying spirit emerges—
Directly to the Imperial Abode.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

As the spirit departs, visualize ascending the celestial thoroughfare, with divine officials and marshals leading the way, the Five Thunder Envoys, Wind Lords, and Rain Masters escorting left and right. Upon arriving at the Golden Tower and Jade Chamber, the Seven Treasures Palace, see golden youths and jade maidens attending, guiding the perfected official to announce your presence before the Jade Emperor. Bow three times.
Next, rise and burn the Heart Petition, then prostrate to present the matter.
Envision the guiding perfected official transmitting the decree and acting accordingly.
Next, rise and bow three times in gratitude, then enter the Celestial Pivot Ministry. Bow three times before the master, report the matter, and request troops. The master assigns soldiers and generals to return with you.
Immediately seek the Golden Bridge, descend through the Jade Chamber and the Towering Pavilion to re-enter.

Next, recite the incantation:

Spirits return to the five limbs,
All bones and joints harmonized.
Spirits attend me,
Essences and souls return home.

Myriad spirits sing in unison.
The Dao’s foundation is harmony—
Naturally, divine radiance.
With a single inhalation of flying light—
Visualize the golden light *qi* atop the head, inhale three times, and swallow. Perform Yu’s Steps to return to the stellar alignment.

Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Step right into Po Jun, then turn the body to face the Dipper’s mouth. Next, perform the Five Thunder Rite to command the ten thousand spirits.
Write the character for "thunder" in the air with the right hand, then form the thunder mudra with both hands, brushing upward from the kidney points, passing the ears, and silently circulating three times.

Next, recite the incantation:

Heavenly thunder rumbles faintly—
Visualize thunder roaring atop the head, dragons and tigers intertwined.
Envision the *qi* of the liver and lungs converging, sun and moon arrayed.
Visualize the sun and moon’s radiance to the left and right, revolving and illuminating my form.
Attendant officers and generals—
Act with utmost urgency!
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Upon reciting the incantation, spray a mouthful of water, envisioning it transforming into clouds and mist. Issue a command with a voice like thunder echoing through an empty valley—heavenly soldiers and thunder spirits instantly descend to the designated place to capture malevolent spirits. The ritual master performs the sealing and wielding of the method.
Once complete, sit in stillness for a moment and strike the teeth three times.

Next, recite the incantation:

Heaven’s prosperity, Earth’s alignment—
Harmonize with me.
Spirits return to their chambers,
As if to their native home.
Each returns to their jade palace,
Receiving the Dao without bound.
The Emperor’s decree—
Guard and protect the cinnabar chamber.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Instruct the attendant to prepare jujube tea. Swallow the talisman of the numinous character, then strike the teeth three times. Descend from the altar, hold the Dipper mudra at the waist, and recite the Dipper-Raising Incantation:

Celestial alignment, Earth’s discipline—
Myriad spirits guard and protect.
True *qi* returns to the heart,
Stellar alignment rises with each step.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

Visualize the Dipper’s radiance revolving from the head and returning to the mouth—swallow it!
This concludes the silent presentation of the method.

Silently address the talisman—
Inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper:
By decree and incantation,
Yin demons retreat, yang spirits ascend.
Souls pursued, spirits bound,
Penetrating the depths of the unseen.
Ascending to heaven, entering the earth,
Might of the perfected transforms into spirit.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

**Secret Method of Presenting the Numinous Treasure Petition**
Before presenting a petition, observe seven days of abstinence, including three days of purification. Enter the oratory and avoid worldly affairs.
Each day, employ the Heart Petition Talisman, the Great Peace Talisman, and the Petition-Subduing Talisman, facing the auspicious direction and swallowing them with pure water.
When ingesting, hold the talisman in the mouth, press the tongue against the upper palate, and tilt the face to gaze eastward. Inhale the blue *qi* from the nose into the mouth and visualize it.
Next, gaze upward to the heavens and inhale the red *qi* through the nose into the mouth.
Then, look downward to the earth and inhale the yellow *qi* from the ground through the nose into the mouth.
Visualize the three colored *qi* blending in the mouth, forming a single luminous sphere, radiant as the sun.
Envision the talisman within this light, then swallow it with water. Perform this daily for talisman ingestion.

Next, recite the Petition-Transmitting Incantation:

Spirit within the heart,
Lord of the Cinnabar Origin,
Three inches in length,
Seven *fen* in breadth,
Clad in vermilion robes,
Girded with crimson skirts.
Riding majesty and virtue,
Manifesting supreme numinosity,
Communing with transformations,
Reaching the utmost truth.
Dwell within the heart,
Never leave the body.
If urgent matters arise,
Hasten to report.
Now, with this heart petition,
Humbly request response.
Swiftly, swiftly, as statutes and commands ordain!

**Heart Petition Talisman**
This talisman is the petition’s secret—inscribed in cinnabar on a square inch of yellow paper, burned, and prepared with well water according to the method. Ingesting it during practice purifies body and mind, swiftly enabling an audience with the Supreme Emperor.
Ghosts and spirits behold it and retreat.

**Opening Heart Great Peace Talisman**
**Petition-Subduing Talisman**

The three talismans above are all inscribed using the Yuqing mudra, drawing in the golden radiance of qi.

**Consecration Incantation**
Consuming the divine talisman summons the true numina.
The hundred spirits hasten as messengers,
Adjusting and penetrating the heart’s essence.
The Six Jia stand guard in solemn silence,
The Five Phases’ primordial qi flows in profound obscurity.
Before the chaos of primordial beginning,
All things flee their forms.
Perceiving color, they already know—
The sacred scriptures of heaven and earth.
Called the "Opening Heart,"
Ingesting it brings great peace.
Attaining knowledge of the natural,
Ascending in flight to the Purple Court.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and commands ordain!

**Opening Heaven Talisman**
May the true numina of the Heaven-Penetrating Heaven swiftly descend with majestic power.
Above, it connects to the Celestial Pass, opening the way to boundless ascent.
The messengers of the Three Bureaus, jade maidens, and spirit youths,
Yin-yang adjudicators holding fire before their chests—
Diminish and dispel demonic ghosts, dissolving them in the vast qi.

**Opening Heaven Talisman Memorial**
By command of the Most High’s Opening Heaven Talisman:
Now, I respectfully call upon the talisman’s messengers—the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Generals—to bear and present this memorial. Hasten to deliver it to the imperial presence, passing through the realms of the Dipper’s winds without obstruction or interception. Should any disobey,
Summon them for judgment.

**Heavenly Prison.**
Let it be executed in accordance with the proclamation’s decree.
**Void Talisman:**
Within the Yellow Center, qi severs and extinguishes evil traces.
The Dipper’s winds and Nine Shamefuls—vast qi subdues the multitude of malevolence.
By command of the Opening Heaven Talisman, it pierces straight through the Nine Heavens.
Should any obstruct the memorial’s passage, bind and deliver them to Fengdu.
The Flowing Gold Fire Bell illuminates the Yellow Center through and through.
Dragon-Tiger mounted officers present the memorial in the Cloud Palace.
All under heaven rejoice as one; for ten thousand kalpas, it shall never end.
As the proclamation commands, it is transmitted by wind-and-fire courier.
In the year of *Tai Sui* [X], the [Y] month, [Z] day, and [W] hour, the decree is issued.
The humble official, Minister [Surname] [Given Name], respectfully receives the proclamation and carries it out.

**Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, the Tranquil Response and Manifest Protection, the Heaven-Supporting Three Heavens’ Teaching.**
*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Nineteen* concludes.

**Method for Summoning the Purple Maiden Immortal**
For all practices, first craft a small winnowing basket, inserting a single chopstick at its head. Use approximately two *sheng* of pure ash, stored in a clean vessel. Set up a spirit tablet, inscribing it: *Immortal Assembly of the Purple Maidens of Penglai*. Sweep and purify the chamber, placing the three items within. Perform morning and evening offerings with utmost purity.

When making a petition, spread the ash upon the table’s surface. Bring the basket near, and the officiant burns the talisman while reciting the invocation. Upon completion, have a virtuous and refined person stand as the guest, while the officiant stands as the host, each lightly supporting the basket with empty hands, flanking the table. The chopstick will prick the ash—when the immortal arrives, the basket stirs, or writes the character *zhi* (至, "arrival"), or *jiang* (降, "descent"), or the name and title of the descending immortal. Offer libations as the heart dictates, and present the petition’s intent. Whether seeking to resolve abstruse meanings in scriptures, compose literature, inquire into secrets, attain perfection, divine fate, arrange marriages, or assess the *fengshui* of dwellings or graves, all may be spiritually communicated. Illustrious worthies of former ages—such as the Banished Immortal of Fragrant Mountain or Dongpo of West Lake—have occasionally descended, their words beyond mere counsel. When the writing fills the space, transcribe it, then sweep the ash smooth to continue. If the initial invocation fails to summon, do not resent or profane it; persist in repeated entreaties, and the spirit will be moved to descend without fail. With years of practice, the basket may be suspended by a cord, unsupported by hands, or the chopstick replaced with a brush to write upon paper—all depends on the matter at hand.

When the immortal descends, hasten to bow; delay but slightly, and they depart.

Recite the **Water Spell for Purification**:
*"Heaven generates water with the One; Earth completes it with the Six.
One and Six unite, and the Five Phases are founded.
I now command the sprinkling to cleanse—filth flees like flying dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*
Upon finishing, sprinkle the water to purify the chamber.

Next, light incense at the stove, face east, and knock the teeth together while silently praying:
*"I, [Name], bow my head and prostrate myself twice, reverently invoking the Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens. Today, in accordance with the true precepts, I inscribe the numinous talisman to summon the Immortal Assembly of Penglai. May the true qi of the upright and authentic descend from afar to irrigate my body and heart, as well as the brush, ink, paper, and silk I employ. Let my writing of the talisman swiftly achieve spiritual communion. My humble devotion knows no limit in this earnest prayer. So be it."*

Next, silently recite the **Paper Spell**:
*"Essence of the paper mulberry, born before Heaven and Earth.
Dragon scripts and phoenix seals, drawn forth to manifest.
The talisman flies with swiftness, traversing the celestial realms.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

Next, silently recite the **Ink Spell**:
*"Divine ink, numinous and bright, bridging the hidden and the luminous.
The Pine Lord fulfills his duty; the Orchid Companion gathers fragrance.
Immortal perfected ones descend in haste, riding cloud chariots.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

Next, silently recite the **Brush Spell**:
*"The divine brush soars, its fame enduring through ten thousand ages.
Now I inscribe the talisman to summon the ten directions.
Cloud chariots swiftly descend to the numinous precinct.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

After each spell, the ritual master concentrates the spirit, visualizes, and draws qi to blow upon the brush before inscribing the talisman.

**Talisman for Descending Immortals** (inscribed in ink on yellow paper)

**Talisman Invocation:**
*"Supreme Unity’s numinous yang, radiant with purple qi.
The halls are adorned with solemnity, the chambers filled with refinement.
Purple Maiden, Purple Maiden—true scholar of the grotto-heavens.
Cloud tresses and rosy sashes, skin like ice and jade.
Knowing human fortune and misfortune, able to compose poetry and prose.
Once Lady Cao departs, the Purple Maiden sets forth.
May she swiftly arrange her chariot and briefly descend upon the cloud thoroughfare.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

Once the above invocation is complete, place the talisman upon the planchette, burn incense, and strike the teeth together while reciting the following prayer of intent:

*"By command of the talisman-officers of the Three Realms’ immortal courts, I hereby dispatch this mandate of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden, directing it straightaway to the Three Isles and Ten Continents, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, and all the palaces and courts of the immortals. Humbly I invoke the Primordial True Jade-Skin Plain Maiden, the Three Rivers and Great Lake’s Snow-Reflecting Jade Perfected, the Jade-Axle Dao Elder, the Immortal Maidens Cloud Sister, Cassia Blossom, Celebration Slave, Snow Slave, Chief Slave True Minister—all the immortals of heaven above, earth below, the watery palaces, and the yang world, from ancient times to the present. By this summons, may all universally deign to descend. Prostrate, I beseech that for the sake of this petition, you mount crane and phoenix, ride cloud and mist, briefly depart your grotto-palaces, and descend to the dusty realm. May the numen beneath the planchette manifest, and the inward bond be duly fulfilled—my heartfelt devotion knows no limit in its yearning."*

Next, hold the talisman-mandate over the candle flame and burn it. Blow the ashes to scatter them, then gaze toward the east, strike the teeth together, draw in a mouthful of *qi*, and blow it upon the planchette. Lift the planchette and rest it upon the table; if it moves, the immortal has arrived. Should it remain still, continue holding the planchette, strike the teeth again, and recite the spell:

*"Between heaven and earth, clouds and waters stretch afar.
Dare I beseech the immortal youths to array their retinue and welcome?
With rainbow banners and feathered canopies, descend from the cloudy empyrean.
Let no delay linger, lest heart darken and soul dissolve.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

After the spell, envision the immortal’s descent and offer libations as you see fit. Then recite the secret incantation:

*"Clouds gather, mists disperse—
the perfected immortals arrive in an instant.
May they attach to the spirit-planchette,
and with joyful sincerity, reveal their will.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!"*

Once the spell is complete, make your petition as the matter requires. If a "depart" character appears, the immortal wishes to leave. Lower the spirit-planchette at once, then burn incense and offer thanks, saying:

*"Immortals of all heavens and earth, grotto-palace hosts—
though just now summoned, you graciously descended to the dusty realm.
Yet the world’s bustle allows no long stay;
with fragrant incense, I reverently escort your chariot’s departure.
Should future prayers arise, I shall again humbly invoke your presence."*

When finished, strike the teeth once more and recite the spell:

No path remains unpassed, yet the path of departure is hard to find.
Within the four seas, who echoes this sound?
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

**Urgent Memorial to the Mysterious Heaven’s Sacred Text**

For all ritual proceedings, first purify defilements, transform the spirit, and visualize the Four Numinous Beasts guarding the body. Then trace the Yin-Yang Dipper, form the *sha* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, gather the golden-light *qi*, and secretly recite the Summoning Generals Spell:

*"Essence of Mysterious Heaven, called Direct and Mighty Spirit.
By the Marshal’s command, descend swiftly in power.
Stand before the altar, heed the orders and act."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor’s statutes command.

*"Spirits of Heaven and Earth, transform into your essence.
Qian’s primal harmony, sun, moon, and five stars—
Four Direct Messengers, descend with haste.
Arrive swiftly beneath the altar, report and respond in numinous communion."*
Swiftly, swiftly, as Mysterious Heavenly Emperor’s statutes command.

Mysterious Heaven decrees: summon the Four Direct Messengers—Chen An, Liu Ji, Sun De, and Zhang Bing—descend in haste.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Recite the above spell thrice. Then visualize *qi* of the four directions—azure, red, white, and black—converging above the incense like a mass of colored clouds, shimmering with golden radiance. The adept inhales this into the Kidney Palace, courses it through the Liver, up to the Heart, and into the Lungs, then exhales with the sounds *chui*, *xi*, *xu*, and *he* over the incense burner. Visualize golden light bursting forth, revealing the Four Direct Messengers in their directional robes, riding the golden light before the altar. Burn incense again and state your intent.

When finished, the adept holds the memorial in hand, silently recites the middle section once, and directs golden light to blow upon the document, imagining an eight-cornered golden radiance enveloping it. Then silently recite the spell thrice more, visualizing all marshals and generals escorting the memorial. Pass it through the incense smoke, and the adept declares:

*"Open the Gate of Heaven."*
Press the tongue to the upper palate and form the *hai* mudra.

*"Seal the Door of Earth."*
Press the tongue to the jade floor and form the *si* mudra externally.

*"Hold the Human Gate."*
Blink both eyes and form the *shen* mudra.

*"Block the Ghost Road."*
Hold the breath, stand in *ding* stance, and form the *yin* mudra.

When complete, recite the spell again:
*"By Mysterious Heaven’s edict, the Four Direct Messengers all obey.
Acting on Heaven’s behalf, they universally succor the multitudes.
For the people’s afflictions and matters of urgent passion,
this brief memorial is swiftly presented to reach the Perfected.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command."*

When the spell concludes, burn incense and invite the officers. Next, read the memorial document, then offer paper money. Wrap the memorial in a talisman and cast it into the brazier to burn.

Then recite the Dispatching Memorial Spell:
*"Smoke of five colors, surge upward to Heaven with the memorial.
Qi of five colors, ascend with the memorial to the Emperor.
Old qi of the lower palaces must not recklessly interfere.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command."*

When the above spell concludes, the master visualizes clouds of five colors surging forth. The adept sits upright, imagining a mass of red light within the Heart. With the left hand, trace the Dipper, then visualize the red light rising from it. Following the mudra, flick it directly toward the Gate of Heaven, spanning ten thousand miles in an instant. Visualize the Four Generals at the front, bearing the memorial, while the adept’s spirit hosts lead the assembled generals, ascending with the red light.

After a long while, a long bridge appears, radiant with dazzling light. After another long while, ascend the Twelve-Storied Tower, then cross the Crimson Bridge to reach the Jade Palace of the Central Heaven. Purple clouds drape overhead, and the officers and generals wait outside the palace gates. The adept and the Four Direct Messengers enter the palace, turn left into the Hall of Blessing and Sagacity. The gates are majestic, surrounded by myriad spirits.

Visualize the Four Direct Messengers presenting the memorial to the Memorial-Receiving Perfected Officer. Prostrate nine times before the throne, then rise and ascend the left steps to the hall. Kneel before the desk to present the matter. Visualize the Perfected Officer receiving the memorial, and the Mysterious Emperor granting the petition. Bow again, descend the right steps, and prostrate nine times before the throne to give thanks. Exit the palace gates, where the Four Direct Messengers lead the way, followed by the officers and generals. Depart the Jade Palace, retrace the path, and suddenly return before the altar. Gather the red light into the Heart, strike the teeth, and swallow saliva thrice.

Then pray:
*"The Four Direct Messengers and Merit Officers, who have just now guided this audience—now that the court visit is complete, I humbly request that each return to your respective domains. Should future summons arise, proceed as before."*

**Swift Mudra**
Calm the mind and silently visualize the original spirit in the Crimson Palace. Then summon the Four Direct Messengers to descend from the Brain Palace. When the ritual is complete, burn the memorial. Visualize the Four Direct Messengers bearing the memorial, leading the original spirit as they ascend in red light to the Brain Palace’s hall. Within the golden light, the Mysterious Emperor sits, surrounded by a forest of attendants. The adept kneels to present the matter orally, while the Four Direct Messengers submit the memorial. The Sage’s will grants the petition. Bow in thanks and return to the Crimson Palace.

Silently recite the Heart Spell:
*"Om."*

**"Oṃ dhātu dhātu sarva-dhātu svāhā. Namo phaṭ. Svāhā."**

Upon completing the right-hand spell, settle into stillness and await the response. Observe whatever vision appears, and interpret it according to the circumstance. This method must not be employed for trivial matters.

**Daily Audience Rite**
Each day at dawn or in the quiet of night, sit upright, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and recite the Mysterious Emperor’s full title thrice. Visualize a point of radiance between the kidneys, rising through the spine to the back of the brain, reaching the Mud Pill Palace. See golden light shimmering, and silently intone *"Golden Portal Transformation-Body Heavenly Worthy"* twenty-one times. Soon the light scatters, suffusing the ten directions, revealing the Mysterious Emperor enthroned upon the Jade Mountain’s capital—this is the Mud Pill Palace—while your own form stands as a mountain before him, distinct and clear.

Next, visualize the Four Direct Messengers emerging: from the heart through the left eye, from the liver through the right eye, and from the lungs and kidneys through the two ear roots. They stand in the clouds, bowing in attendance. Your own body assumes the aspect of a perfected being, emerging from the Yellow Court with a jade tablet to present your petition, kneeling in reverence. When the audience concludes, visualize the golden light reconverging as before. You return to the Crimson Palace, gazing down at the radiance between the kidneys until profound stillness is achieved—this marks the ritual’s completion.

When subduing malevolent spirits, visualize the Mysterious Emperor with unbound hair and bare feet, his holy countenance wrathful, divine soldiers arrayed in formation, his presence awe-inspiring. For ordinary invocations, envision his holy countenance joyful. When seeking deliverance from misfortune, visualize his holy countenance compassionate.

**Summoning the Four Direct Messengers Spell**
The numinous void’s five *qi*, one *qi* divides into forms.
From the Great Beginning’s primordial chaos, extending to the darkest depths,
Encompassing the six directions, universally planting the divine spirits.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—one *qi* divides all.
All spirits assemble, commanding officers and soldiers.
Seize rebellious ghosts, capture and bind demonic entities.
Four Direct Messengers, true forms of water and fire,
Hear my summons and swiftly descend.
With fetters and cudgels, with capture and restraint,
I stand before the altar, awaiting your response.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

**Four Direct Messengers’ Demon-Subduing Talisman**

**The Unity of Heaven and Earth’s Virtue, the Union of Sun and Moon’s Radiance**

The Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor commands the myriad spirits:
Year-Directing General, Month-Directing General, Day-Directing General,
Hour-Directing General, Heaven’s Barrier General, Earth’s Pivot General,
Six Jia Generals—hasten on rushing clouds,
Six Ding Generals—advance with fiery urgency,
Heaven-Slaughtering, Earth-Slaughtering, Year-Slaughtering, Month-Slaughtering,
Day-Slaughtering, Hour-Slaughtering, Three Origins Slaughtering Ghost Generals,
Disheveled-Head General—seize the ghosts swiftly,
Yellow-Head General—bind the ghosts swiftly,
Prison-Head General—behead the ghosts swiftly.

**Summoning Spell**
Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor, numinous spirit of *ren* and *gui*,
Transforming body in the Golden Palace, commanding the divine soldiers.
Majestic presence resplendent, stellar essences arrayed in brilliance.
Thunder roars and lightning flashes, beheading and slaying demonic entities.
The colossal serpent’s might, the divine tortoise’s awe.
Six Ding and Six Jia, Eight Slaughtering Generals,
Four Direct Messengers, Black Slaughtering Numinous Spirits.
Shaking heaven and earth, banners and ranks in tumultuous array.
At the summons, descend at once, spreading dread and might.
The deities of the Nine Provinces’ earth-altars, blood-offering spirits—
Should any dare resist, shatter their forms to dust.
With one descent of the divine talisman, the ten directions are purified.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

The talisman is inscribed on yellow paper in black ink. Seal the Slaughtering Script, draw in northern *qi*, and press the True Martial Seal. Visualize oneself as the Dark Emperor, commanding the Four Generals to lead troops from the north, riding black clouds into the talisman. To dispel malevolent forces, summon the generals and fumigate or ingest the talisman. For routine exorcisms and disaster resolution, it may be employed as needed.

**Four Direct Messengers’ Credential Talisman**
Recite the full sacred title of the Jade Emperor, press the Jade Script, and draw in golden-light *qi* to infuse the talisman.
Summon the Four Direct Messengers, Attendant Officers: Chen An, Wen Zi, Liu Jiwu, Wen Sun De, Zhang Bingyou.
Recite: *By the Jade Emperor’s Supreme Decree, the Dark Emperor’s full sacred title is invoked to convey intent.*
Inscribe the talisman with the Dark Heaven Supreme Emperor’s command.

Visualize the talisman within the golden light of Heaven’s Gate, descending the golden decree characters into it. Then envision golden radiance filling the eyes. First inscribe the character *huang* (皇) in black, followed by the names of the Four Direct Messengers. Press the Four Seals and anoint with the Dark Emperor’s title. Next, write the character *chi* (勑) in cinnabar, then inscribe *Xuanti Ling* (玄天令) three times as a seal. Anoint the talisman with the Jade Emperor’s title, fold it into an envelope, and employ it.

**Tile Talisman**
Inscribe this talisman on yellow paper in cinnabar. Write the character *chi* (敕) with the Jade Emperor’s full title, then inscribe the talisman’s body with the Dark Emperor’s full title, anointing it with the title below. From Heaven’s Gate, let the secret characters descend into the talisman, beginning the stroke from the *hai* (亥) position.

When burning the talisman, take a tile from the ridge of the afflicted household’s roof, wash it clean, and affix the talisman to it. On yang days, place the tile face-up; on yin days, face-down. Arrange paper money and horses on the talisman, place the envelope on the money and horses, and scatter five-colored petals over it. As it burns, visualize the smoke transforming into five-colored clouds swirling around the envelope, with the Four Direct Messengers bearing it aloft as they ascend.

**Heavenly Script Talisman and Envelope**
On such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, dispatched from such-and-such a place for such-and-such a matter, respectfully await a response on such-and-such a month, day, and hour, as per the master’s decree.
Your servant [Name] respectfully submits.

Inscribe the talisman and incantation.

Amidst layered voids, divine clouds resplendent shine,
In sapphire skies, the Brahma-net’s threads entwine.
The Primordial’s nine dragons draw the chariot bright,
The August One holds court in the azure light.
A myriad perfected gather in the numinous glow,
Pearl-lit radiance unfolds where the sun’s rays flow.
The *Lingbao* scriptures now revealed on high,
Through virtue and power, blessings thereby nigh.

In cavernous mysteries, high peaks conceal,
Jade tones ripple forth on cloud-borne chimes’ peal.
Boundless, beyond thought’s grasp, the Dao’s sea surges wide,
Its waves in ceaseless motion, its depths untried.
Dharma’s meaning flows like rivulets pure,
Nurturing fine sprouts that shall endure.
To succor the destitute, the hungry relieve,
And teach the court’s defense to upraise and weave.
May the August Emperor’s years stretch a hundred million long,
With peace prevailing, blades of war forever gone.
Bowing in reverence toward the Jade Celestial Throne,
Divine blossoms scatter from quills of gold alone.
*Haste, haste, in accordance with statute and decree!*

**Talisman Instructions:**
Inscribe on yellow paper, five *cun* in diameter. Half in vermilion for the talisman, half in ink for the petition’s intent.

**When inscribing talisman or petition:**
First invoke the *Golden Portal’s Transfigured Heavenly Worthy*, then visualize the *Most High Lord Lao* seated above the petitioner’s crown. Recite the incantation while inscribing, envisioning paper, brush, ink, and inkstone all suffused with golden, Brahma-like *qi*.

**For exorcising malevolent spirits or dismantling shrines:** Use black paper, ink inscription.
**For dispelling misfortune or curing illness:** Use yellow paper, vermilion inscription.
**For beseeching clear skies:** Use green paper, vermilion inscription.
**For beseeching rain:** Use red paper, ink inscription.
**For beseeching snow:** Use green paper, white powder inscription.

**Short Petition Format:**
On yellow paper, five *cun* in height, seven *cun* in width. Write in compact script, affixing a small seal at the top.

*Your subordinate, [Name], respectfully memorializes on behalf of [Person] for [Matter].*
*With utmost urgency, this petition is humbly presented before the August Presence of the North Pole’s Mysterious Heavenly Sage Master, Perfected Warrior, True Martial Lord.*
*May the Sagely Compassion deign to grant this plea and bestow [specific instructions for action].*

**Short Petition Humbly Presented with Utmost Urgency**

*Your subordinate respectfully submits this brief memorial, urgently presented for Your August Hearing.*

*On the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year] under the reign of the Great Year-Star, your subordinate [Name] urgently memorializes.*

**Bound-Waist Format**
*Your subordinate urgently memorializes with reverence.*

**Seated Practice of the Mysterious Altar**
Visualize oneself as undifferentiated chaos, like an egg in form. In an instant, water ascends and fire descends, uniting in the Central Palace, resembling a purple-red golden pellet.
Then descend to the Cinnabar Field, passing from the Tailbone through the Spine’s Gate, crossing the Double Staircase to reach the Mud Pill, its hue like the rising sun.
Next, flow downward to the Central Field, its hue like the sun at midday.
Then descend to the Lower Cinnabar Field, its hue like the setting sun.
This is the ascent and descent of the Three Palaces.
Again ascend to the Mysterious Chamber, where the divine radiance shines brilliantly.

**Incantation:**
The Perfected of the Upper Prime dwells in the Mud Pill.
The Controller of Destiny of the Middle Prime sits steadfast in the Crimson Palace.
The Peach Vitality of the Lower Prime holds the register in the Palace of Life.
The Venerable Lord of White Prime, the Noble Son Without Peer,
The Great Unity Controller of Destiny, the Peach Vitality of Extended Years,
Grasp the talisman and hold the register, preserving life and rooting existence.
Ascend to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber,
Within the Eight Obscurities and the subtlest of realms,
Descend to guard the human body, the Mud Pill and Crimson Palace,
Opening the White Meridians, allowing the true qi to flow freely,
From existence into non-existence, the great Dao is natural.
The wonder of the natural is profoundly mysterious, mystery upon mystery.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Upon completing the incantation, one naturally feels the spirit’s thoughts clear and luminous. Visualize the Marshal of the Central Prime emerging within the body; with prolonged practice, one merges with the original Marshal, achieving spiritual communion and natural resonance. Practicing this at dawn while seated is especially efficacious.

**The Messenger’s Seated Practice**
For this method, close the eyes and silently gather the qi of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys into a single mass, descending it to the Cinnabar Field. Envision the Cinnabar Field as a Jade Crucible, with the inner kidneys as the sun and moon. Assume the Thunder Posture with both hands, circulating the sun and moon’s dual qi within the Jade Crucible. Guide it upward through the Three Passes to the Crown Gate, where it transforms into two streams of golden luminous qi, exiting through the eyes. Pierce the Xun Gate, merging the fire-light with the golden light into a single mass. The master then traces the three characters *Zhang Yuanbo* in the air with a sword mudra, visualizing within the golden and fire lights a messenger: a green-faced, yellow-skinned figure with a knotted headscarf and red hair, clad in golden armor with a red mantle, a green immortal sash, barefoot, wielding an iron ruler. Draw it back to the altar to receive commands.

**The Northern Emperor’s Rite for Cleaving Ghostly Fetuses and Ghostly Qi**
The master faces north, visualizing the body as the Six Jia spirits. Hold a battle-axe in the right hand and form the Six Ding mudra with the left hand’s third finger at the second joint—do not move, for movement nullifies its efficacy.

Next, envision the earth as the Black Prison of Fengdu. Burn incense on both sides and place a pure axe before the afflicted person, who stands or sits. The master traces a *tian* (田) character on the ground with the right hand, then writes:

*Divine Lord of the Heavenly Gate*
*Divine Lord of the Earthly Portal*
*Divine Lord of the Human Gate*
*Divine Lord of the Ghostly Path*
*Divine Lord Piercing the Ghost’s Heart*
*Divine Lord Breaking the Ghost’s Belly*

Recite the decree:
*"Reverently summon the Great Black Dew Spirit, the Sixfold Slayer of Ghosts and Demons. Seize and subdue!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Upon completing the incantation and forming the characters, instruct the afflicted to cough once, drawing qi to blow into the center of the *tian* character. The master then swiftly seizes the axe and, following the qi, cleaves downward—whereupon the ghostly qi, ghostly fetus, and ghostly mass naturally dissipate.

*The Twenty-First Scroll of the *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* concludes.*
*The Twenty-First Scroll of the *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* begins.*

Amalgamating the Five Thunders for Inner Cultivation
Invoke the All-Encompassing Thunder Duke, summoning the roar of storm winds.

Sit in stillness, knock the teeth to gather the spirits, close the eyes, swallow saliva three times, press the tongue to the upper palate, and regulate the qi to allow the Three Palaces to ascend and descend—thus complete.
Close the mouth and inhale qi three times, exhale qi once, inwardly observe the Cinnabar Field, then refine the qi to churn the saliva once more, swallow it, and guide it down to the Kidney Palace. Close the eyes, summon wrathful qi to mobilize the liver and gallbladder, stirring the wind to transmit the command. Silently recite the *Scripture of Commanding Thunder to Protect Life* once, or the *Great Golden Light Mantra*—this is called "Refining Thunder."
Green thunder, red and black, moves to press the Nine Palaces.

Close the eyes, inwardly observe the Liver Palace to regulate the qi, press the tongue to the upper palate, and exhale wrathful qi three times—without making a sound or opening the mouth.
Visualize the fiery qi blazing intensely, holding the breath for a moment at the heart and abdomen. Then exhale wrathful qi and *he*-qi three times each, rest again, swallow saliva, inhale qi three times, and exhale *he*-qi three times. Thus, the qi will naturally distribute itself across the Nine Palaces, without straying into idle thoughts.
Red thunder, white qi, ascends to roam the Great Vault.

Close the eyes, inwardly observe the Heart Palace, and gently exhale *he*-qi.
Next, visualize the qi in wrath, causing the gallbladder qi to circulate—this is the wind fanning the fire qi.
Exhale *chui* and *xi* qi three times each, imagining the fire qi of the Heart Palace steaming beneath the lungs, producing white qi that rises to the Crown Gate. Then, with the nose, draw in the qi from the Crown Gate once and swallow it down to the Kidney Palace. Expand the navel to return the qi to its origin, allowing the Three Palaces to ascend and descend.
White thunder, black and dark, descends to roam the Mysterious Gate.

Next, summon wrathful qi to churn the saliva and fluids, sending them down to the Kidney Palace. Visualize the white qi descending to meet the black qi of the Kidney Palace, surging up from the Fengdu Pass. Exhale qi three times—without letting the ears perceive the sound.
Black thunder, yellow and dark, surges through the Eight Extremes.

Next, regulate the qi with wrath, contract the perineum, and move the lower abdomen and flanks seven times. Then visualize the black qi of the Kidney Water passing through the Spleen Palace, merging and refining with the yellow qi of the Spleen Palace.
Next, inhale qi five times—fire is born when it meets earth, and water is stilled when it meets earth. The Five Qi, refined by earth, coalesce into one mass, naturally circulating throughout the eight directions without straying into idle thoughts.
Yellow thunder, purple and dark, lightning traverses the void.

The Five Qi, refined in the Spleen Palace, first form yellow qi, its color like a golden tangerine.
Next, emit the ministerial fire of the Kidney Palace and the civilian fire of the Bladder, descending the sovereign fire of the Heart Palace—this is the true Samādhi Fire. The Spleen is like the belly of a cauldron, with the Bladder and Kidney fires burning below to refine it, turning it a purple-gold hue. Its qi returns to the origin, lush and radiant like lightning, flashing brilliantly as it ascends.
The world of the Celestial Cycle, ablaze with scorching winds.

Hold the breath for a long while, then turn the gaze inward to the Crown Gate. Visualize the Five Qi returning to the origin, where the Valley Spirit of the Crown Gate emits a purple qi of blazing winds, like the abode of the Divine Radiance Thunder Duke. Its qi flickers and shines, illuminating all the orifices with light.
What spirit would not submit? What ghost would not obey?

When the master’s refinement reaches this stage, the Five Qi return to the origin, the Three Flowers gather at the crown, and the purple-blazing qi pervades all heavens and earths, gleaming and flashing. Around the body—left and right, above and below—radiant orbs of light appear. This is the wind, thunder, lightning, clouds, and rain inherent in one’s own body, transforming in unfathomable ways. What ghost would not submit?
Those who gaze upon me die; those who follow me are enfeoffed.
The Black Calendar of the Northern Numinous, the Nine Ugly Purple Lads.

When the master’s elixir is complete and the qi is abundant, the purple-blazing qi ascends to the crown—this is the fulfillment of qi.
Then, emit and guide it upward to the Crown Gate, drawing the qi in through the nose.
Next, exhale to distribute it left and right, then visualize.
Thus, the qi condenses and takes form, transforming the formless true essence to command and employ the formless ghosts and spirits—this is no idle fancy.
The Wind Earl and Rain Master, commanding thunder and leading the winds.

With one exhalation, refine and transform into the Rain Master before you.
With another exhalation, refine and transform into the Wind Earl behind you.
The true qi of one’s own body and its inherent true essence—this is the Thunder Duke.
The radiance of both eyes—this is the Lightning Mother.
This is what is meant by "practicing the precelestial Great Dao, employing one’s own original spirit."
If the master maintains this practice consistently from beginning to end, the true qi will be abundant. One may then sit and summon, stand and invoke, with responses as swift as a moment. Command spirits and employ generals, summon rain and stir winds—just as when using talismanic water to treat illness and expel evil. It is merely a matter of supplementing others’ insufficient qi with one’s own abundant qi. How could it fail to achieve immediate results?
Thunder Duke, Thunder Duke, possessed of great numinous power.
Where the celestial talisman arrives, thunderclaps resound in the empty sky.

When the master has completed the refinement and the spirit emerges from within outward, draw a talisman from the sleeve. Whether summoning thunder and lightning, commanding thunder and rain, or dispelling malevolence and eliminating demons, apply it as needed.
Recite the above four lines aloud, visualize as instructed, and point or wield the talisman to send it forth—there is nowhere it cannot go.

**Seated Practice with Hand Seals and Secret Techniques**
*"The autumn waves of green water in Hai, limpid and clear—*
First step through the Vast and Falling Dipper to the Star of Heavenly Glory, sit in full lotus, clench the fists, and seal the Hai trigram. Draw the qi of the Kidney Palace into the Heart Mansion to merge, then rinse the Flower Pool thirty-six times, visualizing the divine water as pure and limpid.
*A thousand-catty iron axe on You, light at the head—*
At *Shen*, press both hands into the seat, visualizing the thousand sinews and ten thousand veins all unobstructed. The divine water naturally turns the windlass along the spine, ascending directly to the Mud Pill Palace.
*By the river, the noon willow tree at Wei, blown down by the wind—*
Visualize the Heavenly Pillar collapsing the Milky Way, reaching the Twelve-Story Tower and entering the Three Passes. The Willow Star resides in the Heavenly Pond—this is the forehead.
*Even if I embraced Chang’e, I would not be startled."*

At *Wu*, interlock the hands below the navel, cupping them firmly. Visualize the divine water irrigating the five viscera without leaking outward—here the Alchemical Maiden resides at the center, governing the divine water.

*White as snow in the heavens at You—*
Form the Thunder Mudra with both hands. From the mouth, issue wind and clouds, meeting the celestial thunder at *Xun* Gate and *Zhen* Palace. With a *xi* sound, the wind passes from *Kan* to *Dui*, exiting through *Xun* Palace.

*Red as the blood of the scarlet ape—*
At *Wu*, form the Thunder Mudra with both hands. Let the tongue become the thunder-axe, the gallbladder transform into thunderclaps. Visualize the heart-spirit as sudden flame, leading the Five Qi’s Thunder Duke to summon rain, emerging from the Heavenly Gate to strike the convergence of *Xun* wind and rain. Then, form the Thunder Mudra with both hands, tracing from the flanks up to the ears and releasing the *tiao* mudra.

*Light as dust in the void at Si—*
Visualize all spirits within the body having departed. Clasp the middle fingers with both hands, gathering the spleen-spirit to guard the self’s divine abode—thus the body, inside and out, becomes weightlessly buoyant.

*Heavy as a thousand-catty iron—*
At *Yin*, form the Thunder Mudra with both hands, drawing all spirits back into the abdomen, each infused with the qi of true thunder. Visualize the body filling and solidifying, heavy as a thousand-catty iron.

The Four Brothers of the Weaving Maiden—
the twenty-eight lunar lodgings’ bat star—command the eight directions’ eight trigrams’ thunder deities, stationed at the body’s eight nodes (the hands and feet):
*Gou-Lou* brings auspicious fortune,
*Hai* ascends the monk to attain form.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

Invoke the eight thunder deities’ names. With both hands forming the Thunder Mudra, rise from the seated posture, visualizing the thunder spirits escorting you—swift as thunderclaps and sudden flame—ascending from *Gen* to hold the command upon the altar, merging and uniting with the talisman to summon thunder and enact the work.

**Daily Seated Practice:**
With the left hand forming the Thunder Mudra, sit facing *Xun* from *Qian*. First draw a mouthful of *Xun* qi into the Cinnabar Field. The right hand’s Thunder Mudra presses below the navel without moving. The left hand points the *Zhang* Envoy mudra while reciting the incantation:
*Om hum hum. San tan na han nan yan qian yi chi.*

The *Dui* trigram commands the valiant hosts,
The *Gen* palace seals the demonic gates.
The *Li* palace mounts the wheel of fire,
The *Kan* waters surge with towering waves.
Entering the gate, they shake the earth’s axis,
The *Zhen* thunder crashes with a thunderous roar.
Fierce winds topple mountains and peaks,
All generals lend their strength to my body.
Great Void Perfected, Great Numinous Perfected,
Descend swiftly, descend swiftly!
By decree, I summon the thunder deities of all bureaus—
Let the thunder spirits hasten to the altar,
Those who dare arrive late shall first be destroyed in form.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

Once summoned before me, proclaim:
"By your divine power, I call forth the Jade Pivot Executioners—Jiang, Bi, Hua, Lei, Chen, the Five Envoys—
To divide their forms and transform their *qi*,
Descending to infuse my Cinnabar Field."

Recite again the incantation of summons:
"I act by the August Emperor’s decree,
Summoning the Five Thunders.
Clouds race and lightning flashes,
Aiding me to manifest might.
Sweeping away demonic filth,
Beheading demons and vanquishing wrongs.
Where the divine radiance shines,
Ten thousand demons are all shattered.
The Flowing Bell urgently summons,
Thunder and fire surge in flight.
*Om. Tra li chi hum.*
Four-eyed, nine-uglies—
Seized by thunder’s voice and lightning’s glare."

Draw a mouthful of *Xun* *qi* into the Cinnabar Field, then recite:
"Yin and Yang part,
The Five *Qi* linger and sway.
Following my command,
Swiftly arise the rapid thunder.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*"

**Inner Cultivation of the Divine Empyrean: Three Nines Yield Seven**
Each dawn, enter the oratory and sit upright. Knock the teeth, settle the mind, and inwardly observe the heart—
The heart is no-heart.
Externally observe the form—
The form is no-form.
Observe afar all things—
Things are no-things.

Suddenly forget the form, and visualize within the Lower Cinnabar Field an infant in its newborn state. The five *qi* of the five viscera, each bearing its corresponding color, ascend to the Middle Field. The infant transforms into a Perfected Person, mirroring your own form, with the Four Beasts arrayed before, behind, left, and right.

The Perfected Person ascends the layered tower to the Mud Palace of the Nine Palaces, visualizing the Three Masters seated upon jeweled thrones, vast as lotus seeds, the sun and moon radiantly clear. The Perfected Person kneels and recites, as do the Three Masters, their mouths emitting true *qi* that pours into your body. Upon completing the recitation, next visualize a Fire Dragon emerging from the heart. The Perfected Person mounts the Fire Dragon, spiraling through the Dipper and past the Winnowing Basket, ascending directly to the summit of the Empyrean beneath the Thunder Citadel.

After recitation, with the brows’ surge, open the outer Thunder Palace. Beneath the many Jade Towers, the Three Masters sit together, flanked by the host of Perfected Officials. The Perfected Person kneels and recites as before, without fixed repetitions, following the intent of the prayer. Then, descending from the Mud Palace of the Niwan to the Middle Palace, the Perfected Person reverts to its original form and returns to the Lower Cinnabar Field, seated within a sphere of azure jade and lapis lazuli radiance. After twenty-seven days, there is no need to visualize the infant—only the Perfected Person. Proceed from the heart upward to the Mud Palace of the Nine, bowing in homage to the Perfected King, then return to the Crimson Chamber, seated within the Jade Light.

This Way is most secret; practice it with utmost care. Should even a trace of worldly thought intrude, perfection will not be attained. Not only will the numinous response be faint, but one may incur reproach from the celestial bureaus. Such is the subtlety of the inner workings of recitation.

The humble official, your subject [Name], on this day prostrates with purified heart, mouth, and body, offering devotion and presenting this petition to the Jade Pure Perfected King, the Southern Culmen Longevity Great Emperor, the Eastern Culmen Azure Radiance Great Emperor, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, and the Nine Heavens’ Hanwen Personage, the Vermilion Mound Life-Deliverance Heavenly Worthy. May the celestial compassion cast its radiance downward to bear witness.

Your subject delights in longevity and has received the transmission of the supreme Dao, vowing to relieve the afflictions of the people. Now, first invoking the correct *qi* and aiding the circulation of the precious talismans, I humbly beseech the Perfected King’s longevity-*qi* and the *qi* of the sun’s essence and moon’s splendor to descend and infuse me. May my Three Fields and Nine Palaces, the hundred bones and five limbs, the eighty-four thousand pores, the twelve thousand rays of essence, and the three hundred sixty joints be inwardly and outwardly luminous, with *ying* and *wei* fully replete. May the Three Lights merge, the Five *Qi* return to the Origin, the body be purified, and the ten thousand *qi* suffuse the cosmos. When employing talismans, dispatching generals, or capturing malevolent spirits and vanquishing demons, may the response be immediate and the spirits obedient.

Above, I pray for the protection of the state and the peace of households, benefiting people and aiding all beings. Next, may my ancestors of myriad generations, the suffering souls in darkness, ascend to the celestial realms, their bodies secure and at peace, bowing before the Perfected King and ascending to the Golden Towers.

Your subject’s heart is filled with boundless reverence and devotion. Thus, I speak.

**Forming Emptiness into Brahma Mantra**
Form emptiness into Brahma, and true *qi* arises spontaneously.
Vermilion script on jade, the Eight Might Dragon Script.
Preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.
Heal illness and sever evil, bringing peace to all things.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Longevity Great Emperor’s statute and command!*

Facing east, bow thirty-six times from the heart, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize true *qi* coalescing into the Divine Empyrean Lord. Within the radiant *qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Golden Light Jade Terrace, behold the Divine Empyrean King descending upon a golden terrace and jade hall, with vermilion doors and emerald windows, clad in purple robes and regal cap. Crimson slippers rest upon a jade mat; to his left, the sun; to his right, the moon. From the crown of the Perfected King’s head descends azure *qi* with nine rays, red and purple with three rays, gently wafting downward. With the heart’s red *qi* and the liver’s azure *qi*, I surge upward to meet and intertwine, inhaling eighty-one breaths to gather in the Lower Field, forming the sun; sixty-four breaths to the Upper Field, forming the moon; thirty-six breaths to the Middle Field, forming a pearl, clear as water, within which the Perfected King resides.

Bow nine times from the heart and recite:
The Three Lights radiantly clear, ascending to the Nine Heavens.
Golden chambers and jade halls, where the Five Treasures and magic mushrooms grow.
Mysterious yellow and purple *qi* come to illumine my body.
Jade lads and jade maidens bring me their numinous power.
The Nine *Qi* unite as one, the Three Lights merge in harmony.
Above floats the Purple Canopy, ascending into the Purple Court.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King’s statute and command!*

The Azure Radiance Emperor Lord, the Divine Empyrean Perfected King.
The Fusang Sun Emperor, the Western Culmen Moon Sovereign.
The Four Perfected and Three *Qi* coalesce into azure luminous radiance.
The *qi* of the Four Perfected Saints’ essence merges into one, forming a vibrant azure hue like grapevine, clear as water. It permeates the Three Fields. Above, at the center of the brows; in the middle, at the heart; below, beneath the navel—there dwell the Three Corpse Spirits, which the golden light subdues. Within, visualize the Perfected King. The Perfected King appears within the azure *qi*, consuming at dawn and bowing at dusk, tirelessly ascending in golden light.

My body possesses golden light, connecting to the Thirty-Two Heavens.
The sun and moon revolve within; the heart and kidneys intermingle.
Next, employ the golden light to connect with the Perfected King in the Divine Empyrean Heaven, the sun to his left, the moon to his right. With the heart and kidneys of my body intermingling, internally revolve them as one.
The Azure Empyrean Jade Chamber.
Here, the sun, moon, heart, and kidneys each return to their place, exhaled into unity, so that my body is no longer seen—only the spontaneous Perfected King. Then, one may summon generals and command troops.

Inhale the jade radiance.
Draw in *qi* to the Cinnabar Field, and malevolent spirits vanish of themselves; the Three Corpses perish.
The malevolent *qi* of my body is eradicated. Three nines yield seven; bow before the Perfected King.
First, gather the Four Perfected and Three *Qi*, uniting them in my Cinnabar Field, like the azure luster of grapes, its light illuminating the ten directions. Next, borrow the true fire of the Three *Qi* from the south, blazing forth to the east, where the wood sees the fire grow ever fiercer. Passing slightly beyond the Kan position, it reaches the west, the metal of the seven numbers, transforming into the Perfected King, golden and radiant. I am then the Perfected King. Afterward, my Perfected Person emerges, bowing thirty-six times before the Perfected King, as the myriad generals pay homage. This is yet another swift method.

**Method of Ingesting Talismans**

After reciting the incantation, draw the *qi* from the divine palace of the southeast—its hues of azure, crimson, and violet—and swallow it. Each day, inscribe the talisman and consume it. Press the tongue against the upper palate, invoke the *qi* of Golden Light, and recite the Hidden Names of the Three Heavens along with the *Siddhaṃ* Mantra for Empty Completion. Then swallow the *qi* of Golden Light. This is the Supreme Talisman of the First Heaven by Perfected Master Sa, taken thrice daily. Over nine days, twenty-seven talismans are ingested, following the principle of three nines yielding seven.

To the right: recite the *Siddhaṃ* Mantra for Empty Completion, blending divine *qi* to inscribe the talisman with the Hidden Names of the Three Heavens. Chant:
*"Thunder Prince, uproot the source of illness."*
Seven characters.

**Fire Palace Sitting Practice**
Sit in stillness with a tranquil heart. At any time of practice, gaze inward at the heart, exhale impure *qi* three times, then regulate the breath one hundred twenty cycles. Visualize within the space between the two kidneys a single point, where the *qi* of the left sun and right moon—yin and yang—conjoin in the Cinnabar Field. Abide in non-action, allowing the *qi* to ascend naturally to the heart, then return to the kidneys. After a moment, the two *qi* meet in one aperture, coalescing into a golden orb of light, like fire refining the golden elixir pill—yet it is not mine to claim. Witness the five *qi* emerging from the five viscera, encircling this golden orb, ascending from the coccyx along the spine to the Mud Pill Palace. For a time, visualize the sun and moon within the Mud Pill Palace shining brightly, then sense the sweet nectar of the Flowery Pond, swallowing it into the aperture. Abide in non-action. If practiced two or three times, conclude by exhaling fiery *qi* two or three times.

**Secret Principles of Internal Practice**
Sit in stillness with a tranquil heart, draw in the ancestral *qi*, and swallow it down to the Cavernous Abyss Palace, reaching the Mysterious Pivot Palace. It descends through the nine earths and nine ramparts, following intention to the Mysterious Pivot Palace. Draw a mouthful of northern *qi*, blending it in the Yellow Court Palace. Rub the face and comb the hair, visualizing the luminous white *qi* arriving from the west. Massage the Inner Pass nine times and the Outer Pass nine times. From the coccyx, the *qi* ascends along both sides of the spine to the back of the brain, merging into one. It then divides into five paths, entering the Mud Pill Palace and ascending to the Palace of the Primordial Sovereign. Next, circulate water and fire: refine the true *qi* of the Great Yin Jade Pool of Yellow Blossoms on the right, blending it with the true water of the Great Yang on the left. Unite it with the heart’s *qi*, emanating true fire that illuminates the entire body, inside and out, with radiant light.

**Thunder Crystal *Qi* Sitting Practice**
Before sitting, settle the mind and calm the thoughts. Clench both fists, gaze with both eyes at the Central Palace, where a single point of golden light shines, resplendent with the character *□*. Rotate the Earth Axis, sweep the Celestial Pass, and arrive at the Crimson Palace. Visualize the sixth star of the Southern Dipper, from which a messenger descends. Utter the sound *□*, merging into one golden orb. Draw it into the Central Palace, then swallow the nectar of the Flowery Pond. After a moment, envision the entire body suffused with fiery *qi*, then open the eyes—its efficacy is extraordinary.

**Five Thunder Ramparts**

**Rampart Incantation**
Heavenly thunder rumbles low,
Divine thunder roars mightily.
Dragon thunder stirs the waters,
Water thunder churns the waves.
Earthly thunder commands fire,
Thunderbolts strike without bound.
At the divine mechanism’s release,
Demons and spirits are annihilated.
By the Emperor’s decree,
Act swiftly and without delay.

**Following the Rampart**
**Reversing the Rampart**

Daily, note the direction where thunder and lightning manifest. When conducting rituals, first determine the direction of your current position to summon responsive wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning—its wonders are beyond words. If thunder enters the Central Palace, do not proceed with affairs. On such days, the Celestial Generals don their crowns to attend the Primordial Origin; those who practice the arts must be aware of this.

**Primordial August Talisman**
*Primordial August Talisman descends.*
□□□□□□
□□□□□□
□□□□□□

This talisman is addressed to the Golden Gates of the Primordial August, to be executed in accordance with the decree.

Follow the commands of the talisman and act swiftly.

**Decree:**
This talisman is inscribed on yellow paper with cinnabar for prayers of clear skies, on black paper with ink for prayers of rain, and on blue paper with white powder for prayers of snow.

After reciting the incantation, draw *qi* three times into the five viscera, sealing them with *qi* to manifest authority. Then, with the *zi* trigram in the left hand and the *hai* trigram in the right, silently summon:
- Rampart General Zhao Shouyan,
- Rampart-Building General Xiong Xiushang,
- Rampart-Activating General Tian Zhanyao.
Envision the three generals all present before you.

Next, step outside the rampart and circle left three times—this is called "restraining the three hun and stabilizing the seven po." They must not step beyond the rampart’s bounds. Then, step the *Breaking Earth and Summoning Thunder Rampart*.

Swiftly summon the Five Thunders,
Divine generals, descend with haste!
Swift as the Supreme Emperor’s decree!

The above three ramparts are all entered standing atop the Rampart Star.
Gaze forward, recite the heart incantation once.
Next, close the *qi* and step,
Then visualize the Water-Fire *Ji Ji* (Mutual Aid),
The Rampart Star’s radiance illuminating *Xun*’s Gate.
Sword mudra traces the character "eight,"
Visualize thunder gods surging from the Earth Portal to the altar, awaiting commands.

When sun and moon lose their light, comets appear,
Drought, locusts, pestilence, or vengeful ghosts invade the realm,
Or when corpses or demonic anomalies in the cardinal directions assail the living,
Inscribe this talisman to suppress them—efficacy is immediate.

**Dispatching the Talisman and Incantation—**
Heavenly numen, earthly numen, the Three and Five conjoin.
By imperial command, I investigate and restrain demonic beings.
Direct-Day Merit Officers, attending generals and functionaries,

Subjugate!

Thunder rumbles in the heavens, rumbling deep;
At Zi, the earth’s thunder roars.

At Yin, radiance shines clear.

**Three Lights Talisman**
First, face east and knock the teeth nine times.
Visualize the disheveled general within the sun, clad in crimson, descending.
The Lord of the Sun, also in crimson, descends with the nine-rayed qi of the Great Yang into the belly.
Next, face west and knock the teeth ten times.
Visualize the Sovereign of the Great Yin within the moon, clad in white, bearing a jade scepter, descending,
With the ten-rayed qi of the Great Yin entering the belly.
Then, face south and knock the teeth eight times.
Visualize the Star Lord of the Celestial Pivot descending,
With the golden qi entering the belly.
Then visualize the three qi merging in the cinnabar field.
Soon, the qi of the Great Yang emerges from the left eye, nine inches from the forehead;
The qi of the Great Yin emerges from the right eye, nine inches from the forehead;
The Star Lord of the Celestial Pivot, hair unbound, three-eyed, sword in hand, clad in a gauze robe, stands before the face.

**Upper Terrace:** One yellow repels misfortune.
**Middle Terrace:** Two whites guard the body and pacify the home.
**Lower Terrace:** Three blues extinguish calamity and dispel spirits.
Wherever the Terrace Stars arrive, fortune is established.
The myriad spirits uphold their duties; all anomalies hide.
The hosts of spirits stand in awe—
Upon the talisman’s arrival, obey!
*Hūm! Oṃ! Hūm!*
All spirits bow their heads; demons submit to rectitude.
Who dares transgress shall be reduced to dust.

**Jade Clarity Sacred Realm:** Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin.
**Upper Clarity True Realm:** Heavenly Venerable of the Numinous Treasure.
**Great Clarity Immortal Realm:** Heavenly Venerable of the Dao and Its Virtue.
**Most High Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heaven.**
Next, visualize the Dark Emperor atop the head, hand grasping the character for "decree,"
Inhaling and blowing it into the talisman.
I am a disciple of the Heavenly Master;
I govern the Six Heavens and their palaces—
They are mine to command.
I know the names of the Six Palaces—
Thus, those who attain long life,
Who dares transgress?
The Most High shall obliterate your form!

Open the Gate of Heaven, close the Door of Earth,
Seal the Human Gate, block the Ghost Road,
Pierce the ghost’s heart, rupture the ghost’s belly.
*Oṃ! Va-□-ra yung-□-li svāhā!*
*Oṃ! Va-□-ra □-ra svāha!*
**Western Text:**
By the insignia of the Emperor of Heaven and Śakra,
Bearing the Celestial Pivot—
Why do the fierce ghosts of the Five Directions not perish?
A single inhalation by the Flying Immortal subdues ten thousand ghosts.
Swiftly, swiftly!

Heaven Slayers, Earth Slayers,
Yearly Slayers, Monthly Slayers,
Daily Slayers, Hourly Slayers—
All lawless, defiant ghosts,
Hasten here to be slain by my talisman!
Swiftly, swiftly! *Slay!*

Again, with the central brush, invoke and dispel
All perverse qi, ghostly qi, demonic qi, and poisonous qi within so-and-so’s body—
All shall be annihilated.

**Stabilizing the Hun Method**
Again, gather the five brushstrokes to the center and recite:
The Azure Emperor guards the hun,
The White Emperor attends the po,
The Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi,
The Black Emperor circulates blood,
The Yellow Emperor presides at the center—
The myriad spirits shall not transgress.

Again, return the brush and recite:
May the numen of Heaven protect my vitality,
Granting long life.
The Supreme Mystery’s One guards my true form.
The Spirit Lords of the Five Viscera, each ensure peace.

Next, inscribe the character for "strength,"
Circulate the qi of the sun and moon—
Do not release it.
Recite the Celestial Pivot incantation,
Altering the last two lines:
"Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot,
Seize the ghost and draw it into the heart."
Then circulate the brush as before.
Add five strokes while reciting:
Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire,
Abyssal Samādhi Fire,
Thunderfire, Thunderbolt Fire—
This is the Five Fires and Three Lights.

**Five Thunder Tian-Character Talisman**
Hold the brush in the right hand, the Thunder Array in the left,
Knock the teeth five times.
Inhale the qi of the Xun direction, lightning entering the brush,
Then inscribe the talisman with a single breath.

Green waters, limpid waves, profoundly clear,
An axe of a thousand catties—light as its back.
By the riverside, willow trees sway in the wind,
Yet embracing Chang’e brings no alarm.

Light as dust in the void,
Heavy as a thousand catties of iron.
White as snow in the heavens,
Red as the blood of the gibbon.

The Weaving Maiden, the Fourth Brother, Gou Lou—auspicious,
Profit ascends, the monk attains form.
Swiftly, swiftly—
By the command of the Thunder Sovereign!

Once the talisman is inscribed and the incantation complete, add the following invocation:

The Azure Sovereign guards the hun-soul,
The White Sovereign attends the po-soul.
The Vermilion Sovereign nurtures qi,
The Black Sovereign courses the blood.
The Yellow Sovereign rules the center—
None among the myriad spirits transgresses this.

Reverently summon the true qi of the Five Thunders,
The divine qi of the Five Thunders,
The true qi of the Thunder Marshal,
The upright qi of the Thunder Spirits,
To enter this Thunder Talisman
And heal your disciple [Name].

Expel all perverse black-ghost qi,
Seize every unrighteous qi,
And consign them to the primacy of my Five Thunder’s Pole Star,
Where they shall not stir.

Swiftly, swiftly!

Another incantation follows:

Lords of the Five Thunders in the Jade Treasury,
In darkness, the celestial drum resounds.
Wind Earl sweeps away pestilential vapors,
Lightning Mother dispels suffering.
The thunderbolt strikes down demons,
Rain Master pours forth dharmic rain.
It irrigates the Triple Burner,
Clears and unblocks the viscera.
Where heavy, it lightens at once;
Where damaged, it mends at once;
Where hot, it cools at once;
Where pained, it ceases at once.

Swiftly, swiftly—
By the command of the Thunder Bureau’s statutes!

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll 23: *"The Nine Transformations of Marshal Deng’s Sudden Fire Talisman Method"*—transmitted by the Taiyi lineage.
*Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 80, records Yang Gengchang’s *"Sudden Fire Statutes and Marshal Deng’s Great Method"* as belonging to the same tradition; this may serve for reference.

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll 24: *"The Great Method of the Flying Swift Five Thunders"*

Within inner cultivation, the practitioner first sits in stillness. Begin by reciting the *Golden Light Mantra*, then visualize the green, yellow, and white qi emerging to envelop the body. Envision one’s entire form as radiant golden light, devoid of any inherent self—only a single spark of crimson qi descending to the Gate of the Kidneys, where it surges upward in a clash to the Celestial Gate. This qi then returns to the body’s palace, where the green, yellow, and white qi now stand before it. The five qi of the practitioner’s body surge forth to merge with these three, blending into a single golden light, like a sparrow hawk—golden within, white without.

Next, inhale the yellow qi, recite the *Golden Light Mantra* again, and with the hands form the Thunder Seal, tracing past the Xun direction. Visualize the Three Marshals and the Five Directions’ Thunder Deities in the Xun quadrant. Offer prayers as desired, then draw them into the Primordial Palace to merge as one, reciting the Three Marshals’ root mantras and secret incantations.

**Attire of the Three Thunder Marshals:**
1. **First Marshal Deng Bowen**—green-faced, phoenix-beaked, silver-fanged, crimson-haired, azure-bodied, a hundred *zhang* in height. In his right hand, a thunder hammer; in his left, a thunder drill. Born with two fleshy wings, eyes emitting light, and dragon claws for feet. He soars through the Three Realms, devouring demons and spirits.
2. **Second Marshal Liu Shengguang**—yellow-haired, crowned with a nine-leafed flame coronet, demonic in form, his face the red of spattered blood. Clad in a short turquoise cloud robe, tied at the chest, beneath which he wears golden scale armor. Black boots, wielding a sword.
3. **Third Marshal Deng Duqing**—blue-haired, crowned with a five-leafed flame coronet, black-faced with white eyes and small pupils. Dressed in a short white robe, tied at the chest, beneath which he is fully clad in golden armor. Black boots, his feet resting upon two water wheels. On his back, a wind sack; in his hands, a long spear.

**Divine Transformation:**
*"By the decree of the Jade Clarity Highest Emperor, the Five Thunder Divine Kings—hasten to my crown!"*

First, with both hands form the seal from *Zi* to *Mao*, step the Dipper, and draw the qi of Xun. Blow upon the left and right, visualizing the self as the Great Envoy of the Five Thunders.

Recite:
*"All evil spirits and hundred ghosts—miao miao, their eyes extinguished!"*

*Swiftly, swiftly—by the command of the Thunder Bureau’s statutes!*

Recite the above incantation thrice, draw the qi of Xun, and blow upon the hands. Then form the seal.

*"Sudden Fire of Qian, awe of Kan, radiance of Gen,
Zhen’s myriad, Xun’s evil, Li’s dust, Kun’s shards—
Dui!"*

Recite these eight characters while tracing the Eight Trigrams, then form the Dui seal and recite:
*"August Heaven’s Qian spirit, Earth Mansion’s Kun spirit,
Nine Luminaries’ law, swiftly inscribe the statutes!
Black Chariot’s sacred swiftness, Dipper’s Righteousness—seize!"*

Follow the Dipper’s path.

Following the Dipper’s path in reverse, trace the stars: *Kuí, Tān, Jù, Lù, Wén, Lián, Wǔ, Pò*. Then trace forward: *Pò, Wǔ, Lián, Wén, Lù, Jù, Tān*.

For the *chén-xū* Dipper, form the *xū* seal and recite:
*"Thunder-Fire Decree—command the slaying, seize!"*

For the *xū-chén* Dipper, form the *chén* seal and recite:
*"Swiftly, swiftly—by the Thunder-Fire Decree, command the slaying, seize!"*

Shift the seal to *mǎo*, form the *Fire Beak* seal: the little finger crosses over the second finger, the second finger presses the little finger, the thumb seals *lí*. Then recite:
*"My yang spirit shatters yin ghosts,
Mighty celestial gods—thunderclap, seize!"*

Secret incantation:
*Ōm. Xū-ōu-xū—[...] yǔn-lǐ-zhà, seize!*

Personal incantation:
*"By the statutes of the great gods,
Supreme of Wind and Fire.
Twin arms, vast wings,
Soaring through Qian and Kun.
Slay demons, devour calamity,
Bind ghosts, gather souls.
Summon rain in an instant,
Clear skies in a moment.
As the incantation is spoken, so they descend at Xun’s gate.
Flying sand, rolling stones,
Shaking the true numina.
Qi descends from the Five Directions,
Driving thunder, subduing gods.
Commanding the Fire Generals,
Annihilating evil spirits.
Aiding all beings,
By the Supreme’s decree, act!
Swift Generals of the Five Thunders,
Marshal, hasten forth!
Swiftly, swiftly—by the Thunder-Fire Decree, command the slaying, seize!"*

Visualize the great god’s arrival. With the left hand, form the *Fire Beak* seal, envisioning it flying into the altar space—flames a thousand yards high, filling the chamber—then inscribe the *First Marshal’s Talisman*.

Talisman-issuing incantation:
*"Sudden Fire, great god,
Flame of true rectitude.
Hurl fire a myriad leagues,
Illuminating thunder’s might.
Commanding the great generals,
Governing the hosts of officers and soldiers.
Ancient trees, malevolent shrines,
Blood-feeding guests,
Spring sources, earth and stone,
Grass-clinging spirits.
Fierce officials with wolf’s teeth,
Flowing metal, fire bells.
Heaven’s wrath shakes with fury,
Shattering their forms.
Relieving the people’s suffering,
Bringing peace and tranquility.
Swiftly, swiftly—by the Thunder-Fire Decree, command the slaying, seize!"*

When inscribing the *First Marshal’s Talisman*, recite the personal incantation, then the *Descending Sage Incantation*:
*"Vast luminous source,
True qi rides forth.
Swiftly bestow clear seizure,
Fire Decree—hasten!"*

Recite this incantation without fixed number, up to forty times. Upon completion, press the tongue to the upper palate, visualize the heart’s qi forming a red bridge, cross the *xùn* gate, and imagine the great god’s true form flying toward you. Envision your liver and gallbladder’s qi merging into a single azure emanation, uniting with the celestial general as one body.

Recite the unifying incantation:
*"Heaven-Thunder-Fire Great General, Thunderclap Perfected Lord,
Temporarily leave your precious hall,
Descend to my altar below,
Assist me in enacting the law,
Seizing and capturing evil spirits.
At my talisman’s summons,
Swiftly respond with your voice!"*

Visualize the *Sudden Fire* great god’s true form clearly. With both hands, form the *Fire Beak* seal, envisioning it flying into the altar space—flames a thousand yards high, filling the chamber—then inscribe the talisman.

*Flame of True Rectitude Talisman*
(Also called the *Great Thunder-Fire Talisman*)

Burn this talisman alongside the *First Marshal’s Talisman*, using the *Thunder-Fire Incantation* when inscribing. For rain prayers, face the *Great Slayer* direction; for exorcising malevolent shrines, face the *Slayer* direction, and burn it at the sword’s tip.

**Second Marshal**
Transform the spirit’s function as before.

Next recite:
*"Thunderclap, great god,
Assist me in issuing commands."*
Form the *duì* seal:
*"Thunder’s celestial sound—eternal foe.
Sound—destroy! Celestial—swiftly seize!
Swift thunder, fierce wind,
Slaying ghosts with lightning speed."*

Next, trace the four Dipper paths in reverse and forward, as before.
*"Swiftly, swiftly—by the Lightning-Fire Decree, save and seize!"*

*Ōm hūm hūm.
Hū-chì-duō-zhà—lǐ-chì, seize!*

*"I, free of illness, shatter yang spirits,
I am the yang spirit shattering yin ghosts."*

Conclude the rite.

**Fierce Official with Wolf’s Fangs, True Sovereign of Thunderclap.**
Flashing wheels of fire, spread vast across heaven and earth.
Roaring with thunderous might, the Five Peaks tremble and collapse.
Command the thunder to summon rain, command the rain to summon thunder.
Lightning and thunderclap shatter the spirits of rock and stone.
Fire chariots stretch ten thousand leagues, thunder and lightning surge straight ahead.
Subduing demons and seizing monsters, they rescue and protect all living beings.
By the Emperor’s decree, the law and command are executed.

**Second Marshal’s Talisman**
Second: visualize the Marshal upon his chariot.
Third: with the foot, stir the thunder chariot upon the earth.
Fourth: turn the wind-and-fire chariot, reciting the *Incantation of Descent*.
When finished, press the tongue to the upper palate, direct the heart’s *qi* straight to the *xun* gate to form a rainbow bridge, summoning the Marshal forth from the *xun* palace. The azure *qi* of the adept’s liver and gallbladder merges and bursts forth, uniting with the celestial generals. With each recitation complete, visualize the Grand Master flying into the talisman.

**Talisman Consecration Incantation**

By the Emperor’s decree, the Jade Pivot is executed.

**Third Marshal’s Talisman**
Bright stars of the four wheels—summon wind, fire, water, and celestial thunder to seize!

Next recite the *Incantation of Descent*.
When finished, press the tongue to the upper palate, exhale the heart’s red *qi* straight to the *xun* gate to form a rainbow bridge, summoning the Marshal forth from within the body. The white *qi* merges, uniting with the celestial generals. Again recite the *Uniting Incantation*, visualizing the Marshal flying into the talisman.

**Talisman Consecration Incantation**
Fierce generals of the Divine Empyrean, spirits of the Abyssal Cavern,
Swift-flying messengers, I summon you by name.
Five Thunder Messengers, do not tarry long.
I inhale *qi* and you come, I exhale *qi* and you depart—
clearly receive the command and act without delay!
Swiftly, swiftly—by the Wind-Thunder-Fire Decree, execute and seize!

Press the thumb against the *chou* position, the three and four fingers, curl the palm, extend the two and five fingers straight, and act at will.

**Activating the Talisman’s Generals**
When using a single Marshal’s talisman, inscribe the name of one Marshal and dispatch that Marshal; the rest follow likewise.

straddling a yellow dragon.

**Talisman of the Eastern Wind-Thunder Envoy Jiang**
For all talisman-scripting:
First, draw forth the white *qi* from the lungs, lustrous as silver,
blend it with the liver’s blue-green *qi*,
then exhale the liver’s blue-green *qi* to inscribe the talisman.

*Bluegreen Thearch’s Thunder Duke,
ever guard your proper palace.
Do not move recklessly—
remain steadfast within.*

"Hasten, hasten, by the command of the Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor."

Once the right-hand incantation is complete, draw in the blue-green *qi* of the East into the liver’s eastern position, coalescing it into blue clouds. Visualize the talisman within, then take the white *qi* of the West to cover it.

**Talisman of the Southern Fire-Thunder Wall Envoy**
First, blend the kidneys’ black *qi*—deep as purple-black—with the heart’s red *qi*, then exhale the heart’s red *qi* to inscribe the talisman.

"Heaven serene, Earth at peace,
the two *qi* intertwine.
True *qi* inwardly secure,
no evil *qi* may linger."

"Hasten, hasten, by the command of the Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor."

Once the incantation is complete, draw the southern *qi* into the heart’s *Li* Palace, coalescing it into red clouds. Visualize the talisman within, then take the black *qi* of the North to cover it.

**Talisman of the Western Mountain-Thunder Hua Envoy**
First, blend the heart’s red *qi*—vermilion in hue—with the lungs’ white *qi*, then exhale the kidneys’ *qi* to inscribe the talisman.

"Lung spirit, Lung spirit,
true after fire’s reign.
Southern *Bing-Ding*,
I serve the Venerable Lord."

"Hasten, hasten, by the command of the Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor."

**Talisman of the Northern Water-Thunder Lei Envoy**
First, blend the spleen’s yellow *qi*—golden in color—with the kidneys’ black *qi*, then exhale the kidneys’ *qi* to inscribe the talisman.

"Heaven’s heart resides in *Kan*,
*Jiaogou* returns to *Qian*.
Evil spirits and demonic specters,
instantly dissolve into smoke."

"Hasten, hasten, by the command of the Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor."

Once the incantation is complete, draw in the black *qi* of the North into the kidneys, coalescing it into black clouds. Visualize the talisman within, then take the yellow *qi* of the Center to cover it.

**Talisman of the Central Earth-Thunder Chen Envoy**
First, blend the liver’s blue-green *qi*—like azure gold—with the spleen’s yellow *qi*, then exhale to inscribe the talisman.

"All spirits bow in reverence,
creation’s transformations align.
The gods of the Yellow Elder,
follow the Primordial Sovereign."

"Hasten, hasten, by the command of the Thunder Ancestor Great Emperor."

Once the incantation is complete, draw the central yellow *qi* into the spleen’s palace, coalescing it into yellow clouds. Visualize the talisman within, then take the *qi* of *Xun* to cover it.

To summon thunder, present the talisman of the corresponding palace, combining it with the external talisman—this is called "severing and verification." The practitioner must visualize themselves as the Heavenly Perfected August One, clad in a garment of *jie* leaves, in the likeness of the Divine Farmer, seated in *Qian* facing *Xun*.

**Uniting Qi Incantation**
"Thunder King of the Current Season,
bestow your majestic radiance.
Enter my five viscera,
sweep away misfortune.
May my three *hun* be clear,
my seven *po* harmonious.
Fulfill my vow,
dissolve past debts."

"Hasten, hasten, as the law commands."

Recite nine times.

**Five Directions’ Original Body Incantation**
"Celestial Officials, Earthly Waters,
Metal Horns, *Kang* Clan,
*Fang*, *Xin*, *Wei*, *Ji*—
transform evil into blood.
By the command of the Great Emperor of Lifespan."

"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil,
remove poison by decree, seize and bind.
Gather *Jing*, *Gui*, *Liu*,
*Xing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, *Zhen*—
all spirits, assist in swift capture."

"*Geng-Xin* metal *qi*, *Wu-Ji* *Kui*,
*Lou*, *Wei*, *Mao*, *Bi*, *Zi*, *Shen*—
hasten to aid my practice,
rush to my altar and stir thunder’s roar.
Hasten, hasten."

"Reverently summon the Holy Śramaṇa of the North,
hear my invocation and descend from afar.
With unbound hair and sword in hand,
come to the star altar.
*Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, *Wei*, *Shi*, *Bi*—
the Celestial Pass descends, decree slays and seizes.
Mountains align with their positions,
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—
the five directions follow the true *qi* in capture."

**Summoning *Xin* Heavenly Lord Incantation**
"Fierce minister *Xin Hanchen* of thunder,
fangs like sword-trees, flames spewing smoke.
Overturning rivers, uprooting seas, toppling heaven and earth,
uprooting mountains, shattering stones, dredging springs.
If ferocious spirits or malevolent ghosts dare transgress,
my body’s gaze will make mountains crumble.
Fire chariots and thunderbolts blaze ceaselessly,
soaring through clouds, riding mists across the void.
Hasten, hasten, as the law commands."

**Generative Incantation**
"Lord Thunder of All Heavens,
flying thunder shakes the sky.
Green thunder, red *qi*—
ascend to the highest heavens.
Red thunder, yellow *qi*—
direct thunder to the center.
Yellow thunder, white *qi*—
pervade and stabilize the nine palaces.
White thunder, black *qi*—
descend to the dark depths of *Xuanfeng*.
Black thunder, green *qi*—
direct thunder to return east."

**Destructive Incantation**
"Lord Thunder of All Heavens,
call forth thunder and shake the winds.
Green thunder, white *qi*—
pervade and stabilize the nine palaces.
White thunder, red *qi*—
ascend to the highest heavens.
Red thunder, black *qi*—
descend to the dark depths of *Xuanfeng*.
Black thunder, yellow *qi*—
surge through the Supreme Ultimate’s radiance.
Yellow thunder, green *qi*—
flash lightning across the void.
Unite with humanity,
prosper with the Dao.
Hasten, hasten—*Jiao*, *Ji*,
*Jing*, *Zhen*, *Zhang*, *Yi*.
Enveloping the world in scorching winds,
what ghost does not perish?
What spirit does not submit?
Those who defy me die,
those who follow me are enfeoffed.
Black chronicles of the North,
Nine Uglies and Purple Youths.
Wind Earl and Rain Master,
drive thunder and drink rainbows.
Where the Thunder Duke arrives,
ten thousand ghosts vanish without trace.
Hasten, hasten, as thunder’s law commands."

After reciting the preceding incantation, black clouds swiftly gather at the *weilü*, ascend the spine, and reach the *niwan* palace. The crown of the head splits open, revealing a great spirit soaring and standing in the Great Void.

**Closing Incantation**
"East severs the path of mountain *xiao*,
*Mao* and *You* sever the gates of stone spirits,
*You* and *Nan* sever the path of the Heavenly Master’s arrival,
*Wu* and *Bei* sever the village of the Earthly Master’s departure,
*Zi* severs the blood-eating ghosts of the five directions,
the Central Heavenly Way is severed,
*Hai* severs the Earthly Way,
*Si* severs the Human Way,
*Shen* severs the Ghost Way.
At *Yin*, the Five Thunders decree a single strike—
evil ghosts’ roots are severed.
I call upon the Five Thunder Envoys
to block and seal the gates of ghosts and spirits."

After the incantation, visualize your body as a thunder citadel: thunder chariots at the left ear, fire chariots at the right; celestial thunder at the left foot, earthly thunder at the right. The five fingers of the left hand are the five envoys. Your spirit follows the great spirit, soaring through the Great Void. Your body becomes the great spirit, ascending to the celestial court.

Behold the heavenly gates manifesting in numinous radiance. Present a vermilion tablet from afar, gazing toward the celestial gates. See golden-red light in myriad rays, standing upon the dragon terrace. Report today’s affairs, then step back to witness jade maidens bearing the Jade Emperor’s golden writ, decreeing the Thunder Bureau.

Soon, the great spirit stands before the throne, receiving the mandate. The great spirit bears the writ and follows. Bowing in farewell, descend from the celestial gates, the great spirit leading the troops below.

In an instant, your spirit returns to the center. The great spirit stands atop *Xun*, bearing the writ. By the method, absorb it into your body. The thunder spirits of the four directions are all gathered into the golden writ, and the myriad spirits assemble. Then swallow the *Total Seizing Talisman*, entrusting it to the great spirit to bear.

Within the talisman, hundreds and thousands of palace generals enter therein, enveloped in golden light.

**Returning Spirit Incantation**
"The Five Thunder Generals transform into a thousand perfected,
I now unite with you in form.
The Golden Mouth of the Most High transmits the record,
teaching me to regenerate a body beyond this body.
Hasten, hasten, as the law commands."

Once the *Total Seizing Talisman* is inscribed, summon forth the great spirit to stand in the *Xun* Palace, bearing the golden writ. With mudras formed in hand, call forth the hundreds and thousands of palace officials to the altar, drawing them all at once into the golden writ. They are entirely transformed into golden light, then absorbed into the talisman—the talisman being the golden writ itself.

**The Five Envoys and Their Uses**
*Eastern Envoy, Jiang:* Governs healing, expelling evil, and seizing malevolent spirits. Pacifies people, protects creatures, and fulfills all prayers and petitions.
*Southern Envoy, Bi; Western Envoy, Hua:* For prayers of rain, face the drought-stricken direction, form the mudra, and summon them. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on black paper. Recite the incantation while spraying water from an eel’s mouth, and black clouds will surge forth, thunder and rain arriving instantly. Point to where the dragon stirs. When employing these envoys, they command the local earth spirits and the Thunder Department, bringing rain across forty *li*. If possessing a body, they immediately transmit the Five Envoys—these envoys are most mighty and fierce.
*Northern Envoy, Lei; Central Envoy, Chen:* In practicing the Five Talismans, resonance must arise between heart and mouth. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, burn each talisman to ash, and swallow it with an infusion of *jiangzhen* incense. For prayers of clear skies or rain, the response is extraordinary. To exorcise malevolent spirits, use gold coins and cloud-horses to swiftly attain efficacy. When first practicing, recite the incantation daily, inscribe the talismans according to the method, and swallow them for sixty days—then the thunder spirits will respond at once.

**Steps for Praying Rain**
*First Day:* Establish the altar and install the positions of the thunder spirits. Submit the memorial petition, attaching the left writ to the document.
*Second Day:* At dawn, dispatch the Five Envoys. Next, bury the *yang* talisman and burn the *yin* talisman. Press the left hand upon the thunder chart, sit facing *Xun* from *Qian*, and draw a mouthful of *Xun* qi, swallowing it into the cinnabar field. Keep the right hand’s thunder chart pressed against the navel, unmoving. For example, on a *jiazi* day, visualize the eastern blue qi generating southern fire; the southern red qi generating central earth; the central yellow qi generating western metal; the western white qi generating northern water; and the northern black qi generating eastern wood. Then, with the left hand, form the mudra of Envoy Zhang and summon him before the altar to attend to the matter. Extol the divine charioteers, and invoke the Five Envoys—Yu, Bi, Hua, Lei, and Chen—of the *Yushu Slaying and Investigating* Department. With the sword mudra, cleave open the *Xun* gate. The ritual master presses the tongue to the upper palate, visualizing the incense smoke as a golden bridge extending to the *Xun* gate. Recite the heart incantation of the Five Envoys, and the envoys of the five directions descend along the golden bridge to stand before the incense burner on the altar.

The ritual master exhales the liver’s blue qi to summon Envoy Chen; exhales the spleen’s yellow qi to summon Envoy Lei; blows the kidney’s black qi to summon Envoy Bi; breathes the heart’s red qi to summon Envoy Hua; and sighs the lung’s white qi to summon Envoy Jiang. These merge with the incense smoke and the Five Envoys. According to the time limit set by the matter’s intent, offer prayers and dispatch them to ascend to heaven, commanding the clouds and governing the rain. Employ the double chart: circulate from the kidneys to the crown, then execute the mudra for wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning, casting it outward.

*Third Day:* After the meal, ascend the altar. Burn talismans to dispatch the envoys. Recite the *Three Purities Incantation* and the *Golden Light Incantation*. Unfurl the banner, plant the sword, and summon Envoy Zhang. Burn the urgent summons, the official document, and the right contract. Dispatch the envoys and ritual masters into refinement, or rest briefly. Summon the Generals of Establishing the *Gang* and Treading the Dipper, step the *Breaking Earth* and *Thunder Gang*, or the *Dipper Gang*, or the *Wind, Cloud, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning Gang*. Step the *Thunder Gang* to *Qian*, then exhale qi to transform it into a golden bridge leading directly before the ancestral masters. Lead the celestial officials of the Golden Palace forward to submit the memorial. Upon receiving the decree, step the *Yin Dipper Gang*, descend, and exit the celestial gate. Hold the *Jade Text* in the left hand and the *Heavenly Flail* in the right, or form the sword mudra. Step to the *Xun* direction and inscribe in the void: *"By the Emperor’s command, urgently summon the thunder spirits."* The *Xun* gate swings wide open. Issue the order to summon Envoy Zhang and all the generals, merging with the previous incantation.

Then perform the triple offering and blood oath. First, burn the *Opening Thunder City Talisman* and the talismans of all the generals to dispatch them. Whether joyful or wrathful, send them forth one by one, setting a deadline for clouds to rise and rain to fall, greatly manifesting efficacy. Use the *yin* chart on *yin* days and the *yang* chart on *yang* days.

**Example of Cloud-Raising**
Suppose today at the *yin* hour, you receive the petition for prayer, or to rouse thunder to strike a temple or slay evil. First, inscribe the eastern talisman, consume one copy yourself, then burn another over the incense. Close your eyes, calm your heart, and visualize your body as withered wood, burned by fire and reborn as an infant. Envision the liver’s blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* toward the eastern *yin* position. After a long while, step the *gang* and kick the *yin* position, shouting: *"Eastern Wind and Thunder Envoys, subordinate to the *yin*-hour Direct Talisman Thunder Spirit, swiftly raise clouds in this direction!"* After a long while, visualize the eastern blue qi stretching thousands of *zhang* into your body, then inhale the form of the eastern talisman, directing it straight east. Slightly open your eyes to observe—vigorous clouds will arise. If clouds appear in all four directions, break the cloud qi of the primary direction to exalt its supremacy. If wind arises from the east as a sign, this is called *Overlapping the Correct Chart*. Then employ the *Counter-Flow Method*: face the western *shen* position to draw the eastern qi, blow it toward the west, and again blow the eastern talisman toward the west. Pray: *"The eastern direct talisman general has already manifested cloud qi. Western counter-flow *shen*-hour direct envoy thunder spirit, swiftly respond with cloud qi to fulfill the vow!"* If the response is slow, blow the lung’s qi upon the western talisman toward the western *shen* position—it will respond at once. Thereafter, follow your heart’s prayers to summon rain or rouse thunder, all according to your intent. Finally, burn the *Pass Document* to set the day and hour, and the great response will be attained.

Once the talismans are circulated in succession, guide each direction’s qi and the Five Envoys’ talismans into their respective palaces to station and reside. When employing them, use the talisman of the corresponding palace along with the Five Envoys’ talismans. For the eastern talisman, draw it into the liver palace through the nose.

As with the south, west, north, and center, draw each in through the nose in like manner.

**Opening the Thunder Citadel Talisman for Rain-Petitioning**
First employ this to command the *Qian*-Heaven’s thunder and lightning.
Wield the brush to issue the decree, reciting the incantation ten times or more:

**Jade Writ’s Primary and Secondary Marshals**
From the *Haotian* Golden Gate, descend the Jade Writ: Primary Marshal Tian Shouzhong.

True King within the Radiant Realm,
Might reigns over the Nine Heavens.
Hands grasp the Three Pristine,
Feet tread the Nine Profound.
Golden Tiger slays ahead,
Flying Dragon coils the Qian.

All granted as spoken.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Radiant Realm’s True King’s statutes command!

Upon completing the incantation, close the eyes. With the left hand, form the *Zi-Wen* Thunder Seal, while the right hand assumes the Sword Mudra at the waist. Circulate the kidney *qi* downward, visualizing it passing through the *Weilü* (Coccyx Gate), ascending to the *Jiaji* (Spinal Pass), then guiding it to the *Jianggong* (Crimson Palace). Next, circulate a breath of heart *qi* in the same manner. The two *qi* of the Crimson Palace merge as one. Press the tongue against the upper palate, envisioning the Golden Bridge forming as it sweeps into place. Circulate the *qi* to inscribe the Five Peaks, completing the characters *Ling You Shen* (靈祐神). With the true water of the *Huachi* (Flower Pool) beneath the tongue, swallow it into the *Shenshi* (Spirit Chamber).

Then, using the *Precelestial True Northern Emperor Incantation*, form the seal and rub the abdomen five times. Inhale through the nose, drawing in a stream of golden *qi* from the *Yin Dou* (Yin Dipper) □ star, guiding it together into the chamber below. Visualize a *Yang Dou* (Yang Dipper) rising, and summon the *qi* of the Dipper’s *Gang* (Asterism). Immediately recite the secret incantation to hasten its arrival:

*Om yan li □ yan li □ hum hum ma ni.*

Recite the right-hand incantation three times, visualizing the various generals in their regalia arriving at the altar. Then, summon *Guan Wen* anew, maintaining the previous Thunder Seal, and recite:

*Om ji li ka □ hum gun nao li svāhā.*

Three times.

*Om xi yi di lan tuo ye.* Three times.

At the cyclical signs *ding*, *ren*, *gui*, and *xun*, withdraw the troops as swiftly as an arrow. Step left across the *Kuigang* (Asterism Stem), and Heaven and Earth manifest at once.

All the aforementioned generals having arrived before the altar, issue commands to summon the generals as usual, or invoke them. Then, blow the previous *qi* onto the brush and recite:

*Om bi sen ji om □ zha om shen she.* Three times.

*Xu li jue li fu na □ ni hu hong ti shen om li ka shen en he yin cha □ chi ti na na □ si die □ o □ ti hong hong li zha she ka hu zha bi cha fu na.*

*Hasten, hasten, as by the True King’s law and decree!*

Direct the *qi* of the Heart Fire and blow it onto red paper, writing in cinnabar. For rain, write on black paper.

Grasp the brush and write the talisman, blackening the center beneath the Community Deity Thunder Seal. Visualize the True King.

First write the Jade Taboo character *huan*, visualizing gold. Next write the *chi* (decree) character, visualizing the envoy’s golden plaque being passed on. Write the three characters of the Heavenly Decree in gold, then inhale and blow them into the talisman. Next write the two characters *she ling* (Community Deity), visualizing the five *qi* intermingling within—they are wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning. Then apply ink, visualizing black winds and heavy rain filling heaven and earth.

Make the hand seal, visualizing a great thunderclap. Next, use the seal to stamp the character *he tong* (united) along the talisman’s seam. First burn the left side, then at the appointed time the following day, burn the right side.

Next, let the *qi* of the Divine Empyrean enter, and additionally write *Yangzhou Community Deity Zou Hun* above *Wu*. Next, write the character of the current *zhi* (hosting) constellation, and further add the *zhi* constellation of the second day after this year’s *Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects), covering it with the following twenty-three characters.

**Red Script for Praying for Clear Skies**
*Thunder commands: Community Deity, comply! Let yang light swiftly rise and yin shadows swiftly disperse.*

**Fire Chariot, Fire Chariot—Household of the Thunder Decree**
Three and five as marshals, radiant and boundless,
Hurl fire ten thousand *li* to sweep away all clouds and mist.
By pact, they aid the imperial brilliance—silver fangs cast down,
Water clans swiftly obey without fail.

*Bo Wen* awaits command, standing ready:
*"Yang’s splendor, hasten! Hasten!*
*By the Supreme Emperor’s Fire Decree, I charge the noon hour."*

For this method, adjust as needed in the talismanic mudra:
First inscribe the Jade Taboo, then write *charged* within the incantation,
Invoking great thunderclaps and mighty bolts to bring forth clear skies.

Next, write *Thunder Decree Fire Chariot* in the mudra,
Visualizing flames ten thousand *zhang* high, piercing the celestial realm,
Opening yang and sealing yin.

On the main talisman’s side, alter five characters to:
*"Dispatch and withdraw yin shadows, bring forth great clarity."*
Simultaneously, use the *Sun-Born Fire Wheel* incantation to empower the talisman.

This talisman severs demonic influences—
Within the Black Script, alter it sevenfold.
All calamitous spirits, malevolent ghosts, bandit *sheling*,
Once stirred, shall be utterly eradicated.
All else remains the same.

On the main talisman’s side, revise to:
*"Black winds, thunderclaps, thunderfire—seize and burn swiftly!"*

Water and fire interflow, *Han Bo* bears the boat.
The Three Officials illuminate, the Five Emperors trust the unseen.
By the Supreme Emperor’s decree, dragons soar and rains pour.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the Celestial Statutes decree.

The secret incantation of twenty-three characters is written above the well character:
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the statutes decree.

This method: write in cinnabar on yellow paper,
Affixed below the previous talisman on the memorial.
Inscribe: *"[Such-and-such] Prefecture, [Such-and-such] County’s City God,
Bound to respond by [such-and-such] day and hour—
Act with utmost urgency, fail not in duty!"*
*Hasten! Hasten!* Carry out the command.

For all talisman-burning rites,
The ritual master, before the altar, first summons the two envoys *Zhang* and *Xu*,
Then ascends the altar, steps the *gang* into the Dipper’s mouth,
And in a loud voice recites the *Mu Lang* incantation to rouse the spirits.

**Gang Formation**
*Gang* glare.

I invoke the Supreme Emperor’s decree to summon the Five Thunders.
Should any dare arrive late, their form shall be severed and destroyed.
*"Call the wind, mute the □, scatter the clouds."*
To pray for rain, burn the talisman, step the three *gang*,
And command the Great Spirit of the Earth Altar to fly forth from the three directions.
The Auspicious Star gazes upon the three directions, stepping the Dipper’s path.
When the Dipper’s radiance shines upon the master,
The marshal shall appear before him, heeding the command to urge the Earth Altar Spirit to bring rain.

*"The Sagely *Kui Gang* arrives anew, most numinous.
I now ascend in flight to the Yang Brightness.
Heaven revolves, earth turns—subduing the Six Dings.
The Grand Tenuity commands me to drive the thunder’s might.
The Fire Marshal shakes the flowing-metal bell,
The thunderclap resounds, echoing through the Great Purity.
Should any dare defy, Heaven shall obliterate their form."*

**Taiyi Incantation**
The Earth Altar Spirit is roused to slay demonic fiends,
The drought-demons of Li and Yang all vanish without trace.
Water surges, fire blazes, wind and rain follow,
The flowing bell hurls fire, soaring through the Great Void.
Peach and Guest, Yang’s radiance, dispatch Fenglong,
The Earth Altar Spirits of the Nine Provinces gather thick clouds.
The Supreme Emperor’s decree commands you in person:
Thunder, fire, and bell—delay not!

*Hasten! Hasten!* As the Fire Decree commands.

**Nine Provinces Earth Altar Spirit Gang**
I emerge from the Central Palace,
Yongzhou is called Qian.
Moving past Liang, I stand in Dui,
Yanzhou dwells at Gen’s gate.
The true fire position of Nanyang,
Jizhou resides in Kan’s village.
At Kun’s position, Jingzhou stands,
The root of the Azure Dragon in Zhen’s place.
Xuzhou dwells at Xun’s door,
Yuzhou abides in the Central Palace.
I perform the Great Cavern’s method,
Seizing ghosts under my authority.

**Jade Pivot Grand Marshal Talisman**

My left eye is the sun, my right eye the moon.
Heaven is round, earth is square—thunder dwells in the Thunder Hall, the Eight Trigrams’ secret.
Swift Fire’s might,
Its light shatters a hundred evils with the hammer.
Five Directions’ Barbarian-Thunder Envoys, swiftly arise—Five Directions’ secret.
Drag heaven, haul earth, raise the sky and spew clouds.
My breast vast, embracing the ten thousand images.
My left foot treads *Li*, burning and slaying evil ghosts.
My right foot treads *Xun*, blowing and extinguishing demon spirits.
The Emperor issues his decree to sweep and scour the Nine Provinces.
Heavenly Thunder, swiftly arise! Divine Thunder, swiftly arise!
Dragon Thunder, swiftly arise! Water Thunder, swiftly arise!
Earth Altar Spirit Thunder, swiftly arise!
With one swing of the Thunder Axe—thunderbolts scatter in profusion.
Whoever dares offend shall have their form pulverized.
Southern Fire Clouds aid the thunderbolts,
Northern Water Spirits unleash the thunder’s wrath.
My left eye opens its light, illuminating the eight poles;
My right eye’s thunder-light engenders fire and lightning.
From my left ribs wind arises, from my right ribs fire is born.
Thunder-fire burns the ghosts—ghosts perish, spirits grieve.
Slay heaven, slay earth, slay the year, slay the month, slay the day, slay the hour—
All wayless ghosts and spirits, upon encountering this talisman, self-slay.

Recite the *Taiyi Stalwart Axe Thunder* over the right talisman, without counting the repetitions, and apply it evenly to the body.
When submitting a memorial, hold the axe downward.
When posting for suppression, hold the axe upward.
To strike evil influences, write *Urgent* and hold the memorial in offering.
To seize ghosts and guard the altar, to treat illness and ensure peace, post for suppression and write the *Slay* character below.
When praying for clear skies or beseeching rain, write the *Thunder* character.

**Secret Essentials of Command**
Visualize the True Person of Cinnabar Origin ascending to the Golden Gates of Supreme Heaven to present matters. Supreme Heaven descends golden light into the talisman. The master follows the light and writes—
These two strokes, then write: *By Imperial Decree, Swift Fire, Horizontal Sky Tyrant, hasten here!*
Stand with the talisman at your back, recite the incantation, then join the two strokes beneath the wings. Visualize the black and red qi of the two kidneys entering the talisman, forming two envoys—these are the two strokes beneath the ribs. When summoning, write *Hasten here!*

**Secret Essentials of Internal Activation**
The adept transforms into a Thunder Envoy, concentrating the qi of the five viscera in the Yellow Court, where a True Person of Cinnabar Origin suddenly arises.
Recite:
*Heavenly Thunder rumbles low,
Divine Thunder roars aloud.
Dragon Thunder stirs the waters,
Water Thunder churns the waves.
Earth Altar Spirit Thunder-Fire—
Thunderbolts clash and crash.
With one divine mechanism unleashed,
Demonic essences are slain.
The Emperor’s decree descends—
Fire-haste, obey the command!
Black fire surges,
Fire-lightning blazes bright.
Spiritual hail descends, thunder’s might erupts.
Wind and rain crush the host of demons,
The ten thousand spirits bow in submission—mountains crumble.
By decree, dispatch the Dragon Division’s Yaksha, Red Heaven’s Shouter.
By decree, dispatch the Dragon of *Qian*, Blazing Fire, Horizontal Sky Tyrant—
Stand before me at once, hasten to obey the talisman!*

The adept activates the Thunder Formation, visualizing kidney-water ascending from the *Weilü*, passing through the spine, piercing the *Niwan*, irrigating the Heart Palace, dousing the heart-fire. Water and fire clash with a thunderous sound, surging toward *Xun* to form a single peal. The Great Thunder Spirit manifests.
Next, recite:
*Swift Fire stands at the heart,
The Five Thunders reign supreme.
Clouds rise, smoke and flames ascend,
Illuminating heaven and earth in sequence.
The Five Peaks’ mountains collapse,
The Yellow River’s depths darken.
The Jade Emperor personally issues his decree—
Exterminate the wicked multitudes!
Hasten, hasten, as the *Shangqing Five Thunder Mandate* commands!*

The adept inhales once, and the great spirit enters through the Gate of Myriad Wonders. Visualize it standing back-to-back with the Perfected One. Recite the summoning incantation, drawing the great spirit in like a torrential downpour, absorbing it into the Yellow Court to merge with the True Person of Cinnabar Origin.

*Goudi duona daoli chana hesutu na tanqie qingna weilu hena fengyun jun na qingmo ju □ ju heye.*

Command the thunder and lightning to act with utmost urgency.

Nine Heavens’ Radiant Spirit of Li, with the light of the heart, seize and capture. Thrice recite the incantation while visualizing the marshal stationed in the Central Palace. Then recite the *Taiyi Han Zhen* incantation of the Great Marshal, and behold the marshal emerge from the adept’s crown to stand before them, awaiting orders.

Upon completion of the incantation, merge all into a single invocation. Activate the Thunder Formation and project it before you, ready for use at will. Alternatively, infuse the talisman with spirit—exhale a breath of qi upon it, and the marshal too shall transform into qi. Thereafter, the marshal will no longer be visible; only a ball of fire remains, which the adept absorbs into the heart.

To dispatch the marshal:
Grasp the Thunder Formation with both hands, stand erect, and draw kidney-water up the spine to the *Niwan*. The heart-fire blazes ever brighter. Direct the formation to channel water to douse the vermilion heart-fire in the Crimson Palace. Water and fire clash with a resounding roar. Rotate the formation externally beside both ears to amplify the force. Let the eyes flash as lightning, and the formation strike as thunder. Thunderbolts fill the sky, merging with the marshal into a single entity.

Recite the incantation:
*Mighty spirits of the Law,
Taiyi containing the True.
Five chariots, eight steeds,
Thunder and lightning topple all.
The Supreme Emperor decrees—
Aid this body of mine.
Golden light bursts as lightning,
Swiftly manifest your true form.
Dare you defy or delay,
Calamity shall befall you.*
*Hasten, hasten, by the decree of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven!*

The marshal verifies the talisman and secret incantation:
*By command, Swift Fire, Horizontal Sky Tyrant, appear at once!*

*One begets one, one begets two,
Two beget three, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning governs all.
One begets one, one begets two,
Two beget three, the Great Spirit Deng Xie governs all.*

Recite this incantation thrice in silence, and the spirit shall descend.

The heart incantation of the great spirit:
*Celestial Sovereign Jiaye, seize with thunder!*

The Jade Emperor’s verification secret incantation:
*Chi qian yin tang □ yin he □ yin tu kua yin gu song yin ce zhi yin zhao □ yin □ □ yin ding □ yin ru □ yin xiao zhui yin zhui hui yin hui □ yin qi □ yin qiu kou yin kou xie yin chui zhi □ yin jin □ yin zheng □ yin dang seize.*

To deploy the talisman in the Dipper Formation, inscribe the six characters, then write with the Jade Emperor’s verification incantation. Anoint the character for thunder with the marshal’s secret words. This is the Jade Emperor’s talisman for summoning Swift Fire in its true form.

Secret concealment of thunder essence:
When invoking for rain, first touch the tip of the tongue to Penglai Mountain, channeling the waters of the Celestial River. Then recite the Purification of the Altar incantation:

*The Central Mountain’s divine incantation,
The Jade Text of Primordial Beginning.*

Recite once, and demons shall be repelled.

To Prolong Life:
Traverse the Five Marchmounts, let the Eight Seas bear witness. Demon kings bow their heads, guarding my chariot. Malevolence and filth dissolve and disperse, the Dao’s qi endures forever.

The ritual master forms the Thunder Formation with the left hand, assumes the Sword Mudra with the right, and rests it at the waist. Settling into stillness, they recite the Golden Light Incantation. Upon completion, they visualize golden light pervading heaven and earth, this body and all beyond suffused with radiance.

Next, they intone:
By the Jade Emperor’s oral command, the host of perfected beings enact the Dharma.
Above the nine heavens of Qian, five-colored auspicious clouds arise.
In Kan, golden light intertwines, illuminating Qian and Kun.
In Gen, evil spirits and demons are extinguished, all spirits subdued.
In Zhen and Xun, doors shatter swiftly—soar with the Dipper, visualize golden light bursting open the Thunder Citadel. Thunderous annihilation of wicked essences.
The Three Realms heed the decree, the Nine Bureaus take note.
Li’s Primordial Sovereign of True Prosperity, swiftly manifest in true form.

Form the central formation, and as it takes shape, visualize as the incantation declares:
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ. Baza baga ma śrī jili śun ti oṃ bodhaye ga makā ga huo zhī huo bō huo lún pán pán ga lǜ tái tái shěn shěn zhū zhū bái líng hé hù dì zhā zhā pó tuī hē jīn tóu bīn nà guō jí diāo zhēn rú dì wēi shā sān mèi wū jīng huǒ ní dì niè dì hē gōu ní gōu ní pó sū zhā hē.*

At the first strike, the thunder chariot arises; at the second (zi), lightning flashes; at the third (wei), a resounding crash; at the fourth (wu), the earth quakes; at the fifth (yin), sand flies and stones hurtle; at the sixth (chen), a raging tempest and mighty thunderclap erupt. At si, swiftly unleash fire—execute with haste.

Decree: Heavenly Thunder roars, Chen’s Spirit Thunder roars, Mao’s Dragon Thunder roars, Yin’s Water Thunder roars, Chou’s Earth Spirit Thunder roars.

At zi: Form the Thunder Formation with the left hand, assume the Sword Mudra with the right. Visualize the Six Stars, channel primordial qi from the eyes’ light, inscribe the Qian trigram, and with the Sword Mudra, cleave it asunder. See golden light erupt from the earth; with the sword, direct it upward to burst open the Xun gate. The Six Stars vanish—only the messenger remains by the sixth star, a small star at its side.

Channel the waters of the Celestial River into the talisman in one motion. Circulate ancestral qi to the tongue’s tip, press the tongue to the upper palate, merging the two qi there. With the *chui* character, project it before the face, briefly holding the visualization. Glare fiercely, recite the Sixteen-Character Incantation, and behold the messenger transform into true form, filling the void.

The Sixteen-Character Incantation:
*Oṃ lī hūṃ oṃ, lī hūṃ lī hūṃ. Oṃ oṃ lī oṃ, oṃ lī hūṃ hūṃ.*

Inscribe the talisman and circulate the golden light to form the Eight Trigrams array. The paper becomes heaven and earth, within which the messenger appears, its form like the talisman itself, golden radiance illuminating heaven and earth. With the brush, inscribe the talisman in a single breath, then add the Nine-Character Thunder Seal.

For rain prayers, write the sun’s taboo name first, then the moon’s, and below inscribe the *zuān* character. For clear skies, write the moon’s taboo name first, then the sun’s, and below inscribe the *huáng* character. To exorcise ghosts, add the Big Dipper’s taboo name to the sun and moon, and below the Dipper’s *qi*, inscribe the *huáng* character.

**Rain Summons in Practice**
First, transform into the deity. Step through the [missing characters] Dipper, visualizing each step ignite sparks of fire in all directions, pervading the dharma realm—all six stars thus. Upon completing the steps, retreat to stand on the fifth star, plant the sword upon the sixth star, and burn the summons to command the messenger. Circulate the waters to bring rain, visualizing the Celestial River’s surging flow, the messenger driving the heavenly chariot, drawing the river’s waters as rain.

**Messenger Talisman**
Face the Big Dipper’s direction to circulate the transformative powers. Invoke the general into the brush, secretly recite the Sixteen-Character Incantation, and circulate primordial *qi* to form the character upon the paper. Once the talisman’s shape is complete, inscribe the command. Conclude with a yellow character, visualizing golden light filling the talisman. See the small star beyond the sixth star of the Southern Dipper emit golden light, its radiance meeting the chaotic white jade light—when the two merge, they suddenly burst open. Then behold the messenger. Again circulate ancestral *qi* and draw it into the talisman.

**Talisman-Inscribing Oral Formula**
First, use the Sixteen-Character Incantation to form the talisman. Draw the Kan and Li trigrams over fire, then inscribe the sun and moon symbols above the trigrams. For clear skies, use the Big Dipper’s incantation to smear the Li trigram, drag it downward to the Kan trigram, and anchor it, driving ancestral *qi* straight into Li to emerge. Next, inscribe the clear-sky command, smear it with the incantation, and conclude with a yellow character to seal it. For rain, reverse the process; for exorcism, use the neutral method. Still visualize the messenger entering the talisman, golden light filling it. Then seal it with the Dipper’s *qi*, as one black divides into three. First inscribe your own command at the top. When burning the talisman, circulate the transformation, visualizing the *chì* character in the sky to hasten it. For rain, smear it with the Wooden Youth incantation; for clear skies, smear it with the Great Awesome Virtue incantation.

[Missing characters] for rain.
[Missing characters] for clear skies.
[Missing character] for exorcism.
[Missing character] to shield the body.
[Missing characters] to cure pestilence.
[Missing characters] to lash dragons: use rooster’s blood, realgar, and cinnabar to inscribe upon an iron tablet.

**Obscuring Sunlight in Practice**
Recite the Jade Emperor’s command to harness transformative power. With the tongue, inscribe it upon the upper palate, exhale into a water vessel, then recite the following incantation. Inhale the Dipper’s crimson *qi*, spray it toward the sunlight to instantly darken it, and with the eyes’ light, trace the design.

**Netherworld Incantation**
*Taiwei* Divine Youth, command: *Oṃ chè lī svāhā.*

*Oṃ* Rāhu-Ketu, Earth Mansion—seize and bind.

**Summoning, Assembling, Dispatching, and Dismissing**
Light incense, transform into the deity, pace the Dipper’s *qi*-path, form the Jade Seal with the left hand and the Sword Seal with the right, strike the command three times, then summon the generals.

A single stick of precious incense—
the Ten Directions stand purified.

Next, recite the Jade Emperor’s Decree for dispatch.

Household Missive’s Inner Talisman
Recite the Dark Heaven Sacred Title and inscribe it, then affix the household seal upon the talisman. The talisman paper should measure five inches square by standard measure, or six inches by common measure, and be attached within the household missive behind the Year-Star.

Mantra for the Decree Talisman
The divine clouds shimmer in layered emptiness,
Brahmā’s net gathers in the azure vault.
The Primal Beginning rides the Nine Dragons’ chariot,
The August One reins the azure carriage.
Spiritual light assembles the myriad perfected,
Pearl radiance unfolds the vast expanse.
Revealing the sacred scriptures of Lingbao,
Fortune and virtue thereby summoned.
Within the cavernous mystery, hidden in lofty crags,
Jade tones ripple upon cloud-borne chimes.
Boundless depths beyond thought,
The Dao’s ocean surges with waves.
Dharma’s meaning flows like a stream,
Nurturing the growth of fine sprouts.
Used to relieve the destitute,
Teachings flourish to guard the central court.
May the Emperor’s honor span a hundred million years,
And great peace abolish blades of war.
Bowing in reverence toward the Jade Celestial,

Burn incense and recite the middle chapter once, visualizing the Most High Lord Lao above. Recite the sacred title of the Golden Watchtower’s transformed body and inscribe the talisman. The talisman should be five *cun* square, measured by the standard rule. According to the four seasonal incantations for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, write the petition talisman in ink on the reverse and in cinnabar on the front, then seal the back with cinnabar while reciting the incantation. The petition talisman must be inscribed on the back of the main talisman, though it should not be too large. Write: “On such-and-such a year, month, day, and hour, dispatched from such-and-such a place, divined to receive a response on such-and-such a month, day, and hour—how the report shall manifest. Awaiting the master’s decree, so-and-so bows in reverence.”

For exorcising malevolent spirits or dismantling shrines, use black paper with cinnabar script. For praying for rain, use blue paper with cinnabar script, or yellow paper with cinnabar or ink script. For praying for clear skies, use red paper with cinnabar script. The talisman’s efficacy awaits a response within two hours—if sent at *chen*, expect a reply by *wu*.

**When submitting a petition for the household:**
Clasp the Dipper Mudra with the left hand, from *zi* to *wu*, and visualize a red light rising from the heart. Then flick the mudra, directing it straight toward the Celestial Gate in the north, imagining the red light extending from the altar to the gate, boundless across ten thousand *li*. The Four Direct Messengers stand before the petitioner, one holding the household petition in hand, while the officials of the ritual register follow behind. Together, they ascend upon the red light.

After a while, a long bridge appears, its fine rays shimmering. Crossing it, they continue forward on the red light until, in an instant, a twelve-tiered golden tower comes into view. Ascending its steps, they ride the red light onward, passing a crimson bridge before reaching the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven, its paths wreathed in clouds and mist.

Upon entering the watchtower’s base, the officials of the ritual register and the accompanying generals remain below to await. Only the Four Direct Messengers enter the gate, turning right toward the Hall of the Protective Sage. There, the gates are heavily guarded, with officials, generals, and thunder deities arrayed in formation. Entering, the Four Direct Messengers present the household petition to the True Officer of Memorials. The officer receives it with joy, bowing in reverence, and leads the petitioner straight to the palace steps. After nine prostrations, ascend the left dragon-tail staircase to the hall. Kneel before the imperial desk and present the petition as desired.

When finished, descend the left dragon-tail staircase, perform nine prostrations in gratitude, and depart directly to the gate. There, the Four Direct Messengers await, leading the Demon-Quelling Generals and their retinue of officers and soldiers back to the Jade Watchtower of the Central Heaven. The officials of the ritual register, overjoyed, and the celestial generals escort the petitioner along the original path back to the altar.

Finally, visualize the red light returning to the heart like a ball of fire. Strike the teeth together three times, swallow saliva three times, and withdraw.

**Characters to avoid in household petitions:**
*Qi* (乞), *zhong* (仲), *xia* (瞎), *zei* (贼), *chen* (陈), *fang* (方), *gao* (告), *jinming* (进明).
Do not use these in pairs.

**Dispatching the household petition and sending forth the generals.**

Nine Character Designation:
□□□□□□□□□

To pray for rain and dispel fire,
to pray for clear skies and dispel clouds,
to subdue malevolent spirits and expel ghosts—
with both hands form the Thunder Formation.
Raise it from the Kidney Hall,
up to the ears, visualize the character *xuan* emanating from the heart,
bursting forth from both eyes to form this single glyph.
The ritual master composes the Thunder Formation,
settles into stillness, and recites:

**Oṃ hēng hōng huá là jiù jìng chì.**
*Qian* to *kun* in compliance—
**Oṃ qián yuán chì shā jí zhì chì.**
*Kun* to *qian* in reversal.

When praying for clear skies,
glare fiercely with both eyes,
visualize golden light rising from the kidneys,
the Three Lights entering the talisman.
Eyes ablaze with wrath,
perceive the azure, white, and yellow *qi* in the void,
forming the three characters *Heng Tian Ba*,
radiant across heaven and earth.
Draw them in, absorb them into the talisman, and inscribe them.

Next, visualize within the Kidney Palace a single golden character □,
ascending straight to both ears,
then guide it upward with the Thunder Formation into □□,
and merge it into the talisman.

When praying for rain □,
visualize the ancestral *qi* in both kidneys surging with fury,
both eyes emitting it—
the eyes are the spirits, the primordial spirit is fire.

**Talisman Activation Mantra**
**Oṃ qū bì lì gān bì zhà.**
I summon you—may the Celestial Emperor know.
*Heng Tian Ba*, Deng Bowen, hasten swiftly!

Upon completing the mantra,
form the Thunder Formation,
draw it upward from the Kidney Hall to both ears,
releasing wind and thunder into the talisman.

Next, recite the **Talisman Dispatch Mantra**:
Flying Heavenly Great Spirits,
mighty and fierce, mysterious essence.
Forms divided by the Eight Trigrams,
*qi* blazing to awe the spirits.
I call forth: *Xuān jiū dá zhà xuān tiān dá zhà jù mó lì tí dì zhà shè.*

**Secret Mantra**
**Oṃ □ lī □ lī chì □ lī chì lì dì jié rào.**
Hasten! By the edict of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Father,
Spiritual Might, Ancestral Master,
Marshal Tianpeng, Commander of the Thunder Bureau.

With both hands form the Thunder Formation,
draw it upward from the Kidney Hall to both ears,
releasing wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning—
go forth with augmented might!

**Four Seas Talisman, Thunder Altar, Water Vessel’s Four Seas**

South: Firelight, Flowing Essence’s Spirit
West: Void Sovereign, Great Hua’s Spirit
North: Cavern Yang, Mysterious Numinous Spirit

**Wind-Raising Formula**

When deploying the Five Thunder Chariots for subtlety and efficacy, first inscribe a Yin Talisman—if the operation is already in full motion, this may be omitted. Summon the messenger to arrive, then with the Sword Mudra write the □ character in the air. Recite the Golden Light Mantra and inscribe the Wind-Sash Talisman in the void, or upon grass or candle flame as verification. The Wind Chariot’s appointed messenger will then appear.

First visualize the □ character within, then envision the messenger riding the wind chariot, assuming the form of a tiger, wielding an iron whip in one hand while the other executes the Mudra of the Thunder Formation. Cry out: *Chì zǐ zhà yín dāng xùn lù kūn zhū.* The Execution Text is drawn forth—imagine the messenger lashing the tiger, a great roar rising with the wind. Inhale to the right, exhale to the right, shaping the sound of the two characters in the mouth. Inscribe them upon both palms, then rub the hands together three times. From the *xun* direction, dispatch the wind, and with the *huan* character hasten it. Inscribe the Golden Light Mantra in the void, then drive it forth with lung *qi*. Employ the Mudra of Command, visualizing this character at the Dipper’s mouth, directing the messenger to swiftly raise the *xun* wind—or the wind of any specified direction. To invoke rain, summon the *qian* direction’s wind; the *xun* wind must not be used.

Once the wind responds, direct it toward tall trees or dense forests, guiding it with intent. Test it upon a candle flame to reverse its course. Align the mechanism, radiance, balance, and guardian script—command the myriad spirits, subdue and seize.

**Method for Gathering Clouds to Obscure the Sun**
The practitioner holds a bowl toward the sun and inscribes the character for "sun" within it, followed by the sun’s taboo name. With the *qi* of *Luohou*, the Earthly Mansion, calculate the celestial degrees and seal its light. Recite the *Luohou* Mantra:

*Taiwei* Divine Youth, by edict.

Zhèn (Lightning), Xiè (Immortal), Kūn (Thunderbolt),
Zǐ, Bǐng, Dīng—
Lí.
**Primordial Talisman.**

The Celestial Stalwarts—Taiyi, Shenguang, Xiaoji, Chuansong, Congkui, Hekui, Dengming, Shenhou, Daji, Gongcao, Taichong, and Tiangang.

**Posterior Heaven Generals:**
Within the Zi Palace, the Celestial Rat Grand General;
Chou, the Ox; Yin, the Tiger; Mao, the Hare; Chen, the Dragon;
Si, the Serpent; Wu, the Horse; Wei, the Sheep; Shen, the Monkey;
You, the Rooster; Xu, the Dog; Hai, the Boar—
the Twelve Palaces’ Celestial Generals.

This method’s subtlety lies in heart-to-heart transmission and oral instruction, forming the marrow of the art. Keep it secret.

**Mysterious Essence of the Nine Dippers**
**Secret Incantation:**
Wind, fire, thunder, lightning, and the thunderbolt—seize and behead demons.
*Demon* may be replaced with *essence-corrupting malevolence, shamans, pestilence, or ghostly qi.*
Fire bells, tridents, *Ya*, *Chi Bi*, *Tan Lang*—seize.
Si, Wu, Mao, Shen, You, Hai, Zhong, Liang, Zi.
Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, Lightning, Immortal *Xie*, Thunderbolt—*Bing* and *Ding* seize.

**Diagram of the Big Dipper’s Configuration**
This method structures the Five Thunder Fire Formation. Next, press the *Si* character, summoning wind and fire to pervade the ten directions and survey the boundaries of heaven and earth. Visualize clouds as an iron net to capture and restrain malevolent spirits. Press the *Sha* character and reform the formation.

Next, visualize heart-fire flowing throughout the world. Recite the following six-character incantation to gather and restrain all obstinate malevolence, the Five Penetrations, and spirits that bring misfortune. Tread upon them beneath the left foot, beneath the *Kui* and *Gang* stars. Remain motionless and inactive, reducing them to fine dust.
*Swift, swift!* As the decree commands to restrain and subdue.

With both hands, form the Thunder Formation and strike it into the *Kui*, *Gang*, and Golden Well.

**Six-Character Secret Incantation for Seizing Malevolence:**
*Swiftly seize, swiftly drag, swiftly shackle, swiftly restrain, swiftly behead, swiftly annihilate.*

This method is most secret. Internally, it is transmitted to lineal disciples; externally, to sincere and devoted disciples. Only after making vows before the myriad heavens may it be imparted.

**Fire Bells and Refinement Practices**
The adept visualizes within the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal, beneath the Flowery Canopy, nine luminous stars, each roughly an inch long. Within the Dipper, the Three Terraces lie horizontally at its head: the Upper Terrace aligns with *Xuan* Star, the Middle Terrace with the center of the hairline, and the Lower Terrace with the crown of the head.

Three Terrace Immortals, clad in yellow robes and yellow crowns, emerge. The Three Terrace Stars emit fiery light, within which stand two spirits, each roughly three inches tall, three feet from the face. Both wear red robes and crowns, each holding fire bells. Their radiance spans ten thousand *zhang*.

After a long while, one of the Three Terraces’ yellow lights enters the Dipper from three directions. The yellow light from the Gate and Portal enters, suffusing the five viscera. The two luminous essence-spirits, now transparent and fiery, return to reside before the heart. They exhale fire, coiling it threefold around the body. Hold the breath, burning the body until it becomes thoroughly heated. Then exhale, click the teeth nine times, and the fire disperses into golden light. The spirit transforms into a nine-foot form, wielding flowing-gold fire bells, ever attendant at one’s left and right.

Visualize the body as the color of fine jade. The Terraces and Dipper follow the establishment of the method.

Thus, after one year, one repels misfortune; after two years, one repels weapons; after three years, one becomes deathless. The face radiates purple light, and the body resides unburned within fire. After nine years, yin dissipates and yang flourishes, and one ascends through the smoke.

Practice this visualization daily.

When inscribing talismans for refinement, first visualize the body as prescribed. Only then begin inscribing the talisman. Press the *Li* character, draw the upright *qi* from the Upper Palace, and exhale it onto the talisman’s heart.

This is the Great Deity’s personal command to marshal numinous spirits, subdue evil, destroy temples, summon dragons, and bring rain.

If a ritual master ingests one talisman on the fifth day of the fifth month, they may command wind and thunder. Their body emanates jade-like light, and upon summoning the Great Deity, he arrives instantly. Inscribe it in cinnabar on green paper, ingest it, and burn it while facing the *Xun* Gate to summon him—he will respond immediately.

When inscribing talismans, await the *Gang* star’s alignment with the proper direction before acting. Form the Thunder Formation with both hands, face the southeast, and visualize the Thunder Sound Universal Honored One within a nine-colored halo. Clad in crimson robes, draw nine breaths of golden light-*qi* through the nose, swallowing them into the heart. Visualize the Universal Honored One entering one’s numinous viscera, then transform into the Universal Honored One. Facing Marshal *Xu* Fire, recite the incantation:

*Reverently summon Marshal Deng Bowen of the Southern Xu Fire and Law Command. Swiftly arrive beneath my Northern Dipper’s Kui and Gang stars to await orders.*
*Hasten, hasten!*

*By the Emperor’s decree, I urgently summon the Five Thunders.*
Clouds race, lightning flashes,
assisting my practice.
Might sweeps away iniquity,
beheading demons and vanquishing wrong.
Where the divine light shines,
ten thousand ghosts are crushed.
Swiftly summon with flowing bells,
thunderfire roars and flies.
*Om.*
*Xu, li, chi, hong*—
four eyes, nine uglies—
thunder’s sound, lightning’s light—seize!

Next, recite the Great Divine Incantation of the Law Command. Upon completion, draw in a mouthful of crimson-golden qi of radiant light from the Xun direction, blow it upon the altar, and visualize the Marshal standing upon it. Declare the matter at hand and inscribe the talisman.

*Thunder’s Law Command, Divine Enforcer of the Mandate,
Thunderfire surges, lightning clings to the body.
Virtues of Heaven and Moon, seventy-two legions,
Water Sovereign’s dragon essence commands the Thunder Gods.
Celestial Fire’s blazing spirits—no delay allowed!
For my wrathful heart, wind and rain descend in fury.
Thunder unites the human order; in silent audience, the Divine Empyrean dawns.*

Recite the inner scripture of the Divine Empyrean:

*Divine Empyrean’s Feathered Chapters, Divine Empyrean’s realm,
enthroned at the center.
Governing the ten thousand images, upholding the primordial net.
Supreme Heir of the Great Ultimate, dividing and judging the eight directions.
Above, ruling the Nine Heavens; below, governing the eight regions.
Holding fast to the perfected harmony, grasping the Three Luminaries.
Even the slightest demonic deviation—Jade Clarity’s True King!
Subduing and vanquishing demonic spirits—what evil dares oppose?
Heavenly Might’s crossbeam, soaring above the Dipper.
Divine light surges forth, thunder and lightning spread in all directions.
Eight Awesomenesses spew venom to purge misfortune.
Heavenly Slayers, fierce officers, wielding blades and devouring spears.
Protect my study of the true, that the immortal Dao may flourish eternally.
Brahmā’s qi suffuses the boundless realm.
A thousand gods, ten thousand spirits follow my Feathered Chapters.*

*Yu Yu’s True King inspects the myriad gods,
enforcing the law, engraving jade to strictify the Five Punishments.
Should any dare to test and disrupt the celestial scriptures,
wind-blades shall rend the Fengdu City asunder.
The Nine Depths’ Elder dons a brocade kerchief,
mounting a golden steed to ascend the Jade Capital.
In hand, he bears the ledger of sins to behead gods and spirits.
By imperial decree, the Five Emperors come to examine souls.
Cauldron’s boiling waters, fiery pits, billowing noxious smoke—
ten thousand soldiers and steeds guard the winding springs.
Great convicts endure dire punishments, wailing to the heavens.
Rebellious ministers and traitorous sons—heed these words!
Violate the Jade Law, and you shall fall into ruin.
The myriad gods uphold the law, guarding the mysterious scripture.
Impartiality, loyalty, and filial piety are the gates of the Dao.
Why persist in solitude upon empty mountains?
Why not establish merit to save the world?
Naturally, the Heavenly Emperor shall bestow upon you immortality.
Seven generations of ancestors shall be liberated, ascending to the celestial court.
Let the people enjoy joy and witness great peace.
The Supreme Clarity’s Registrar of Life shall inscribe your name.
Follow the law, serve the Emperor of Heaven,
and the Eight Effulgences’ floating chariot shall birth you in the Purple Palace.
Hasten, hasten! By the Law Command of the Highest Divine Empyrean’s Jade Clarity True King.*

Recite these two chapters daily, and burn the talisman to dispatch the spirits.

*Divine Empyrean, Jade Clarity—
a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers.
Armor of gold and jade, sashes of dragon and tiger.
Seizing and restraining the myriad demons, capturing malevolent spirits.
Following my incantation and decree, the Dao’s qi stealthily encamps.
Seizing souls, restoring spirits.
Lifespan unshaken.
Hasten, hasten! By the Law Command of the Highest Divine Empyrean True King.*

**Inner Recitation Formula of the Divine Empyrean**
The Realized One acts as before, entering the Three Heavenly Gates, proceeding directly to the southeast, the august Xun position. Amidst verdant forests and azure mists, cascading streams swirl—there stands a grand palace, the abode of the Great Emperor of Longevity. The guards are arrayed in solemn formation, as in the Great Mystery’s court.

The Realized One, from the Crimson Palace, ascends the layered towers, crosses the rainbow bridge, and enters the Central Heavenly Gate. Passing through the Three Heavenly Gates, he beholds the towering palace halls, golden tablets and jade inscriptions proclaiming the *Divine Empyrean Jade Treasury*. The Realized One then enters to pay homage and recite the scripture, whether for others or himself. After reciting the scripture seven times, he repents of sins and prays for blessings as before. Bowing twice, he takes leave, exiting the Three Heavenly Gates, crossing the rainbow bridge, descending the layered towers, and returning to the Crimson Palace, where he swallows saliva to conclude.

The recited scripture is the *Divine Empyrean’s Jade Chapters*.

**Silent Audience Formula of the Divine Empyrean**
For the silent audience, proceed to the Three Heavenly Gates marked by golden tablets and jade inscriptions. Do not enter this gate; instead, face the southeast and pay homage to the Divine Empyrean’s palace. Donning red robes, recite the Feathered Chapters. Visualize the True King and the host of Realized Ones on his left and right, all chanting in unison the True King’s golden radiance of right qi, merging with one’s body. Then bow deeply or kneel to present the petition.

If seeking rain, request the descent of a certain general to bring rain, and await the imperial assent. If intending to pay homage at the Golden Palace, take leave of the True King and return directly to the Three Heavenly Gates. Declare the matter to the guardian officials as prescribed, recite the middle chapter, present the petition, and await the decree.

Once the Celestial Emperor has granted the imperial edict, summoning the Divine Empyrean, the True King is seen facing the palace to receive the Celestial Emperor’s mandate, dispatching thunder to bring rain. The True King, bearing the command, exits the Three Heavenly Gates. The practitioner follows the True King out, witnessing him summon the Three Marshals, Five Generals, and all Thunder Gods. The True King orally transmits the Celestial Emperor’s decree: “Due to prolonged drought in such-and-such a place, you, the Thunder Gods, are commanded to bring rain to relieve the drought.” Immediately, clouds gather, lightning flashes, thunder roars, and rain descends.

When the rain is sufficient, the True King again pays homage at the Golden Palace to express gratitude before withdrawing. The Realized One likewise expresses gratitude and returns to the Crimson Palace, following the usual procedure. If not paying homage at the Golden Palace, the True King is still seen arriving at the Three Heavenly Gates to summon thunder and bring rain, after which the usual procedure is followed.

The heavens comprise Nine Empyreans, with the Divine Empyrean at the center. Its scenery is of azure cinnabar, turquoise, and purple jade. The Supreme Emperor resembles the Supreme Clarity’s form. The Thunder City lies at the southeast corner.

**Secret Method of the Great Year for Excavation Talismans**

The Heavenly Master said: In worldly construction, those who violate taboos and die number eight or nine out of ten. The Dharma holds the incantation for excavation, corresponding to the five surnames’ households. If one violates the earth and contracts illness, no medicine can save them. Submit a written petition, then take a peach-wood board nine *cun* long and one *cun* five *fen* wide, tapering from top to bottom. Inscribe the talisman upon it, perform the ritual as prescribed, and install it at the afflicted site. Only afterward may talismanic water be administered for ingestion, ensuring immediate recovery. This must not be recklessly transmitted.

When inscribing the talisman, arrange an incense altar, pace the *Ding*-steps, transform the spirit, and summon the generals, stating the matter at hand. Now inscribe the celestial talisman in seal script, dispatching it to the household to expel all malevolent spirits and deities, pacifying the residence so the afflicted may recover. Strike the brush five times, then inscribe the talisman:

*Upper Terrace: One yellow, pine repels misfortune (巳)
Middle Terrace: Two white, protects the body and secures the home (午)
Lower Terrace: Three azure, extinguishes calamity and eliminates spirits (未)
Where the Terrace Stars arrive, great might is bestowed*

*"I, in service to the Supreme Emperor, beseech the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the great deities of the celestial center, ascending to the Golden Palace to rescue the imperial subjects. As one, descend and command the Year Lord: swiftly dispatch the malevolent spirits, allowing no delay! Hasten as decreed by law!"*

*"By the edict of the Most High, the Year’s Virtuous Deity, master of this year’s incantation, urgently dispatches the malevolent spirits:
卯 Sweep away demonic essences
丑 Let no disasters arise
酉 Rescue the imperial subjects
寅 唵□□子
Fire-haste obey! 午 Repel, and no living malevolence shall dare defy the command!
未 Forever banish to the northern darkness 巳
May the imperial subjects thrive 子文
Preserve the qi eternally 亥文
Peach emerges
The Five Thunder Division’s thunder incantation 安镇宅庭卯文
Evil spirits, rise swiftly, tarry not! 卯文
Upon talisman’s arrival, obey! 中文"*

Take the qi from the direction of the current Year Lord, blow it forth, and recite the incantation. With the left hand in *zhongwen* mudra and the right in *maowen* mudra, hands on hips, cry aloud: *"Officials of the Excavation Bureau, reverently obey the talismanic command! Proceed to the household of so-and-so, expel all malevolent spirits, and suffer no delay! Defiance of the imperial decree shall be met with execution by the Wheel of Law!"* Only then may the talisman-bearer be instructed to prepare, at the afflicted site, five portions of wine and fruit as offerings to the talisman’s generals, the Year Lord’s honored deities, the Five Thunder Generals, the scribes, and the twenty-four malevolent spirits. Present twelve sheets of spirit money and twelve paper horses. Use an axe to drive the talisman into the earth until the character "断" is severed. If recovery is incomplete, drive it deeper the next day until fully buried, then sprinkle pure water to pacify the site.

*Keep this secret, keep it secret.*

Should the adept proceed in person, recite the incantation and empower the talisman as previously instructed.

**Incantation for Empowerment and Dispatch**
By imperial decree of the Supreme Emperor,
the command descends upon the Thunder Citadel.
Summon the generals and scribes swiftly,
to follow the talisman’s march.
Direct the Year’s Virtue and the Honored Year Lord,
to seize and sever all malevolent spirits of the Earth Bureau,
forbidding them to stir disaster or wrongfully harm the living.
Defiance of this decree shall be met with severe punishment.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!*

Inhale the qi of the northwest, exhale to activate the right-hand mudra;
draw the qi of the east, exhale to activate the left-hand mudra.
Clasp both hands in the mudra of the current year.

The Year Virtue’s spirit governs the year’s authority,
the twenty-four spirits each hold their offices.
All are subject to command,
marching at the appointed signal.
Let them rise swiftly,
and dare not recklessly invite misfortune.
Violators of this decree shall be consigned to the depths of Kun,
where wind-knives and eternal night
shall bind them for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!*

**Talisman of Marshal Yin Yuán of Great Might and Virtue**
The Earth Bureau’s Year Lord, General Yin Jiao:
a celestial being with a jade-green face,
twelve skulls adorning his neck,
crimson robes with a black sash wrapped at the waist,
barefoot, bearing a yellow halberd in his left hand
and a golden bell in his right.

**Summoning Incantation**
Fierce general of the Year Lord,
commander of all spirits,
preceded by the yellow banner,
followed by the leopard’s tail.
The seventy-two seasonal markers,
the twenty-four qi,
the twelve taboos—
the malevolent spirits lead the vanguard.
The yellow halberd executes demons,
the golden bell strikes down specters.
Envoys of the five directions,
spirits of plague and pestilence,
by the Supreme Emperor’s decree,
aid my great Dao.
Sweep away all wayward spirits;
should any dare resist,
strike off their heads and present them!
By the statutes of the Dark Capital,
let the demon-slaying never cease.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the command of the Purple Tenuity Emperor of the North Culmen!*

Next, visualize the general riding a black cloud from the south.
Receive him with the qi of your heart,
inhale and draw him down with a sound before your face.
Once the ritual is complete,
clasp the talismanic writ for the malevolent spirits.

**Northern Emperor’s Decree of Summons**
Yin Jiao, hasten here!
All spirits obey the command,
demons and malevolent spirits be devoured,
resistance means death.
By the Emperor Lord’s decree,
the Year Lord and malevolent spirits
*must act with utmost urgency!*

When inscribing the talisman, write the character for the malevolent spirits,
the qi of the Year Lord, and the preceding incantation.
Address the memorial to the marshal thus:
*Commanding the yellow banner, leopard-tail spirits, and all under his authority.*

Rise, Earth.   Seal, Retreat Earth.   Rise, Heal the Afflicted.

Fumigate to expel pestilence. Ingest for protection and submit the memorial. Burn the talisman to ward off neighboring construction.

**Decree of the Mountain and Sea Wood King:**
*Let others act elsewhere—it shall not hinder me.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Once the talisman is complete, recite the *Mountain and Sea Incantation* and apply it. Then invoke the *Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primordial Lords*, who can resolve directional and Daoist calamities. Conclude by employing the *Virtue of the Year Spirit* incantation to dispatch them.

**Northern Emperor’s Four Sage Subduing-Demon Secret Dharma #1: Ritual Procedure**

Whenever inscribing talismans for ritual practice, one must first enter the *jing*-chamber. Next, perform the visualization of transformation, settle the spirit, regulate the breath, recite the incantation, and offer incense to invoke the sages.

As the incense burns the precious talismanic script, its smoke disperses into the azure sky. It coalesces into a jeweled terrace, adorning the Dharma Realm.

Invoke the following through the incense’s efficacy:
The Northern Emperor, Supreme Commander of the Demon-Subduing Host—Marshal Tianpeng, Great Primordial Perfected Lord;
Deputy Commander—Marshal Tianyou, Great Primordial Perfected Lord;
Assistant Commander—Marshal Heisha Yisheng, Primordial Perfected Lord;
Aide-Commander—Perfected Lord Xuanwu Yousheng;
The Perfected Lords of the Five Stars and Five Dippers;
The Star Lords of the Twenty-Eight Constellations;
The Star Lords of the Twelve Celestial Palaces;
The Four Great Heavenly Enforcers of the Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou clans;
The Divine Kings of the Four Departments—Wind, Thunder, Water, and Fire;
The Lords of the Five Marchmounts;
The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas;
The Water Emperors of the Nine Rivers;
General Jiang of the Iron-Faced River of Chan;
The Flying Dragon and Flying Tiger Riding Officers;
All the marshals, generals, and officials of the various bureaus;
The hosts of Fengdu’s underworld offices;
The hundred million divine soldiers;
The boundless assembly of sages.

By this true incense, universally extend offerings. State your intent, humbly beseeching the sagely compassion to remember their original vows, descend to the altar, propagate the Dao’s teachings, deliver the people below, and manifest great karmic retribution.

Upon completing the prayer, the master forms the *sha*-script sword mudra with both hands and raises it to the forehead.

**Summoning Incantation**
The Jade Chapters of the Northern Emperor,
The Primordial Sovereign of the Jade Heaven.
Within and without the Central Yellow,
The radiance of the Northern Culmen flies forth.
Crimson auroras are ingested and worn,
Emerging as yang first arises.
Vermilion brilliance shines resplendent,
Yang follows as yin is born.
Pale auroras gleam luminous,
Yang’s might and yin’s force align.
The Vermilion Mound’s Fire Palace,
The two *sha*-demons face their doom.
Primordial radiant *qi*,
The Southern Dipper stands alone.
The Horn and Chariot constellations,
Divide the palaces into yin and yang.
At this first summons, hasten here—
Divine might, divine radiance!
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*
*Mā □, by imperial decree—hūṃ!*

By the Northern Emperor’s command,
Summon my Four Perfected Ones:
The Rightful Marshal of the Jade Culmen,
The Generals of the Three Sixes;
Mingyuan Yaoqi,
The Generals of the Three Fives;
The Twenty-Eight Constellations,
The gods of the Twelve Palaces;
The Heavenly Enforcers and officers,
The thunder, lightning, clouds, and mist;
Wind, thunder, water, and fire,
The Earls, immortals, marshes, and plains.
Above, they ascend to the Northern Culmen;
Below, they enter the springs’ darkness.
The bureaus and departments judge,
Their elite troops assemble.
The underworld officials of Fengdu,
Follow my commands and march.
Hear the summons, hasten here—
Whether straight or slanting, crosswise or diagonal!
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

After reciting the incantation thrice, draw the primordial qi of the Dark Heavens, trace the mudra over the incense, and visualize its ascent. State your intent, then inscribe the talisman. Clasp the death-sealing script, assume the sword mudra, and cross into the Mystic Gate. Visualize a golden beam of light between your kidneys, ascending through the spine, passing the Wind Mansion, and emerging from the Hall of Impressions. From your eyes, it transforms into a golden rainbow, surging toward the boundless heights of the Dark Heavens. Envision the Northern Emperor seated within a golden radiance, a hundred spirits in attendance, the Four Saints and their celestial legions guarding the four poles. The remaining generals stand arrayed by direction, with the Five Stars, Four Quadrants, Twenty-Eight Constellations, and Twelve Palace Deities illuminating Fengdu, the mountains, and the rivers—all bowing in reverence. From the Emperor’s throne, amidst a hundred-jeweled glow, a golden light emanates from his brow, descending to merge with your own.

When you open your eyes, see only the character "車" above your crown. Your body, too, transforms into the Emperor, with all perfected beings bowing in attendance before you. Next, visualize the Emperor sending down a golden decree. Inhale it onto your brush, then silently recite the hastening incantation:

*Ūṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*
All spirits bow their heads;
Rebellious demons return to rightness.
Those who dare disobey
Shall be reduced to dust.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Jade Emperor’s statutes!*

**Initial Altar Talisman Transformation and Application**

**Execute this with utmost urgency by the edict of the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.**

**Talisman Procedure:**
Use one sheet of yellow paper, cut to a square, trimming excess corners. First, with black ink, write the bureau’s header at both ends of the document. Once all is prepared, invoke the marshal generals to act at the center. First, impress one seal to fix the position, then write the talisman above it, and seal it again. Below the bureau’s header, impress one seal; above the endorsement, impress another—arranged like the three points of a triangle. Then dry it over incense, burn paper money and horses with it, and dispatch the flying talisman to determine fortune or misfortune.

When encountering flying heavenly or roaming earthly great demonic spirits, malevolent gods, evil ghosts, or demonic entities—mountain specters, sprites, and the like—harming the people, whose crimes warrant annihilation: first perform a jiao offering and memorial. Reward the generals lavishly, using twelve feet of yellow silk, cut to a square, to write the talisman. Further, take an iron brick, seven inches long, one foot wide, and half an inch thick. On its face, write "By edict, execute" and record the transgressions of the demonic entity, the official’s rank, name, and the date and time of the order. On the reverse, write the Jade Emperor’s name, the Four Saints’ names on either side, and the names of the Four Ding and Four Spirits below. On the talisman, add the Three Terraces, yin-yang, and the Dipper, then sink the brick at the site of the transgression. If on land, the iron brick is unnecessary—simply write on the yellow silk talisman and burn it with paper money.

For mid-level obstinate demonic entities, use a proclamation written on a talisman for the altar assembly, listing the Northern Emperor’s position after "Your servant, receiving the decree, obeys."

For rain rituals, use an iron tablet inscribed with the talisman and cast it into a deep pool. For regular practice, use the standard form.

**Standard Practice Procedure:**
When performing the ritual, dispatch the talisman according to the form, then turn around and recite the incantation while casting the net.

**Incantation:**
By the Northern Land’s edict, summon Luo [and] Tu Constellations.
The Ox-Ram Execution Seal sends qi flying through the void, the Rabbit Seal darkens heaven and earth.

The Rat Seal leaves no path in confusion, the Rat Seal locks swiftly in place.
The Tiger Seal commands mountains, rivers, seas, and winds, the Fire Seal urgently obeys the Northern Emperor’s edict and the Four Saints’ command.

After reciting the incantation, form the Great Execution Seal with both hands, draw the northern qi, then cross the hands in the Dipper Seal—left hand for the yang Dipper, right hand for the yin Dipper—and release. Recite the Net-Casting Incantation while making the mudra.

**Incantation:**
By the Northern Emperor’s edict, summon the east’s Thunder Rabbit Seal, the west’s Lake Rooster Seal, the south’s Fire Horse Seal, the north’s Water Rat Seal.

In practice, recite the incantation and conjure a pavilion fully furnished with all manner of clothing and provisions, enveloped in golden light. Then escort the soul into the pavilion, seal it with golden light, and dispatch guardians to protect it.

**Flying Talisman Response Divination**
When the talisman reaches the east, the person recovers;
if it wildly flies to the west, their life is imperiled.
Greatly avoid sudden flight to the south—
if it passes smoothly, illness lingers.
When the talisman reaches the northern dead land,
this person will surely enter the Yellow Springs.
If evil lies in the northeast, they will die upon falling;
if in the southeast, malevolent spirits bring misfortune.
If it passes smoothly in the southwest, heaven hastens vows;
if it falls in the northwest, illness persists as before.
If the talisman splits in two, death is certain;
if it pierces beams or crosses pillars, vows torment them.
Burying gold or resisting gold in the paper ash brings fulfillment—
both outcomes may ensure safety.
Only offering gold causes calamity and stagnation—
swift rise and fall foretell a life cut short.
If rats scurry with spirits, treat according to direction;
if the talisman soars to the heavens, the affliction is cured.
Sudden flight with many spirits requires capture and binding;
if money flies and the talisman sinks, misfortune befalls.
If the talisman transforms into a chariot rumbling like thunder,
spirits hasten vows—this is no divine act.
If it suddenly scatters like stars, the person cannot be saved;
if it briefly reunites, the patient survives without grave harm.
This is the true esoteric method of the immortals—
do not transmit it to those unworthy of the divine.

**East:** Auspicious if rising high or passing smoothly, no spirits—beware the 3rd and 7th days.
**South:** Greatly inauspicious if sudden flight, portending danger and shock; if passing smoothly, illness may change; if passing with delay, spirits are present.
**West:** Greatly ominous if wild flight, portending danger and shock; if passing with delay, spirits are present; if passing smoothly, no harm—beware the 3rd and 5th days.
**North:** Utterly dire if wild flight; beware the 3rd and 7th days. Death is certain if passing with delay—no salvation; if flying past, spirits are present.
**Northeast:** Ghost gate—if flying past, spirits cause illness; recovery uncertain. If wild flight passes with delay and lands here, death follows.
**Southeast:** Earth gate—two or three days, greatly inauspicious. High flight brings spirit harassment; smooth flight brings spirit-hastened vows, minor disturbances.
**Southwest:** Human gate—three or four days, greatly inauspicious. Sudden flight or direct fall here is ominous; smooth passage indicates vow activation.
**Northwest:** Heavenly gate—if the patient is mild, the talisman falling here will immediately ease their head while weighing down their feet.

**Soaring Talisman:** If it shoots straight upward then falls, no harm—observe the direction of descent for judgment.
**Split-Form Talisman:** If it rises and splits into two, it signifies a violent death.
**Buried-Gold Talisman:** If it does not rise and sinks into the paper ash, it is called "buried gold"—no harm, still safe.
**Resisting-Gold Talisman:** If it does not rise and instead pierces downward into the paper ash, it is called "resisting gold"—no harm.
**Offered-Gold Talisman:** If it does not rise and floats atop the paper ash, it portends delay and difficulty in recovery.
**Piercing-Beam Talisman:** If it rises and pierces a beam, it hastens vows.
**Adhering-Beam Talisman:** If it rises and clings to a beam or ridgepole, it hastens vows.
**Flying-Money Talisman:** If it does not rise but the money ash does, the person faces misfortune and financial loss—unfavorable.
**Thunder Talisman:** If the ash swirls like thunder with the paper ash, spirits hasten vows—ominous.
**Chariot-Wheel Talisman:** If it stands on the ground and rotates like a wheel, mountain spirits hasten vows.
**Shattered-Star Talisman:** If it rises in three or four pieces, none intact, it portends death.
**Reuniting-Form Talisman:** If it rises in two or three pieces then briefly reunites, the patient will not die, nor suffer grave harm.
**Up-and-Down Talisman:** If it rises and falls intermittently, it portends no harm in advance or retreat.
**Rat-Scurrying Talisman:** If it does not rise but stands like a scurrying rat, spirits are present—treat according to its direction.
**Smooth-Rise-Smooth-Fall Talisman:** If it rises and falls smoothly beneath the roof, a hidden corpse is present—seal it with the talisman.
**Returning-Form Talisman:** If it does not rise until passing the paper, it is called "returning form"—no harm.
**Swift-Fall Talisman:** If it suddenly flies then swiftly falls, it cannot be saved if slow to act—timely treatment averts harm.
**Sudden-Transformation Talisman:** If it ignites and instantly flies like thunder, fierce spirits are present—most suitable for capture and binding.

**Upper Altar Method: Five-Dipper Northern Dipper Seal Formula**
The method states: With the left hand form the Dipper seal, the right hand curls the fourth and fifth fingers while extending the second and third, the thumb pressing the *sha* script. Then bring the left hand’s *sha* script seal to meet the right hand’s *sha* script, crossing the three fingers and brushing the forehead for use.

Cross the two index fingers firmly, then the two little fingers, curl the remaining three fingers of each hand, and press both thumbs into the *sha* script.

**Lunar Evasion Method**
Begin at the current hour, starting from the first day as the Twenty-Eight Constellations, rotating counterclockwise to the current day’s position—this is the location.

**Celestial Stem Evasion**
Add the monthly Jupiter station to the current hour; when encountering *chen*, it is the Celestial Stem. Starting from *hai* in the first month, rotate counterclockwise to the monthly Jupiter station, then add *xu* and rotate clockwise to *chen*—this is the Celestial Stem’s position.

**Volume 32 of *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls* Concluded #1: *The Four Sage Marshals’ Secret Method of Subduing Demons of the Northern Emperor***

This method was transmitted by the Northern Emperor lineage of the Tang and Song dynasties. The *Northern Emperor* refers to the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole. The *Four Sages* are the four great marshals under the Northern Emperor’s command: Marshal Tianpeng, Marshal Tianyu, Marshal Xiangsheng, and Marshal Yousheng. *The Essence of Daoist Methods*, volumes 169 and 170, contains *The Great Method of Subduing Demons of the Four Sages of Huntian Feiti*, which belongs to the same tradition and may serve as a reference.

---

**Volume 33 of *Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls*: *The Lesser Four Sages’ Secret Method Before the Northern Emperor***

**Lineage**
The ancestral master is Zhang the Perfected of the Great Cavern of Western Shu.

**Generals**
The dedicated general for ritual protection is the Vast Spirit of Awesome Power, the Faceless Great General and Northern Pole Commander-in-Chief, Chen Sheng.

His face is black, his moon-like eyes gaze upward and are large and round, his teeth remain concealed, his hair is black and stands erect, and he wears a small green headscarf. He is clad in a black robe adorned with circular floral patterns on the shoulders, golden armor on the chest, and holds in his right hand an iron staff and in his left two iron staves. A dragon blade hangs at his side, and he wears a white sash, white trousers, and white gaiters.

This general is a transformation of the Dark Emperor, who manifested in the world during the late Qin and early Han dynasties. Indignant at the cruelty of the age and grieving over the suffering of the times, he resolved to save the people. Leading an army of a million, he commanded all who followed him, and the realm responded like clouds gathering and echoes resounding. His authority was well-regulated, his commands timely, and his purpose was to deliver and aid all living beings. Upon the fulfillment of his merit and deeds, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he revealed his traces and assisted in the celestial battles, earning merit. A temple was established for him, and he was enfeoffed as a general to harmonize and govern the common people.

In various ritual traditions, there is also a Faceless General. However, this general was known by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern, who understood his whereabouts and memorialized the Northern Pole, leading the troops to return to the altar. All who receive this method must revere and keep it secret; its efficacy will surely manifest. It must not be recklessly transmitted to unworthy persons.

This general communicates directly with the Northern Pole. For all prayers and petitions, the divine response is swift.

The next general is the Great General of Illuminating the Dao, Shedding Blood at the Head, and Assisting the Numinous, Hao Guang.

His face is red, his eyes round, his large teeth bared, and his red hair stands erect. He wears a small topknot, a half-black robe of a pale black hue, and golden armor on his chest. In his right hand, he wields a long blade, and in his left, he carries a ghost-headed sword. He wears a blood-red sash, a scabbard at his side, white trousers tucked up, and white gaiters.

This general is the spirit of the Mighty Celestial Guard. His nature is fierce and detests evil; he executes gods, kills demons, and metes out the harshest punishments. His divine power is resplendent, and he pursues mountain spirits, bringing them back to the true Dao. He transforms and guides the multitudes, and his merit is vast and profound.

This general also appears in other ritual traditions and is included in the registers of the Three and Five Capital Offices. However, in this altar tradition, he was transmitted by Master Zhang of the Great Cavern of Shu, who understood his essential principles and memorialized for his promotion. All who practice this method can surely subdue ghosts. If one venerates and honors him, how can his manifestations not be evident?

The Valiant and Mighty General in Golden Armor, Geng Rong, styled Shu Jie, has a face of ruddy jade complexion. His eyes gaze upward, his hands are clenched in fists crossed before him, and his entire body is clad in fine golden armor. He wears a helmet, a blade hangs at his waist, and a small golden sash binds his waist. His feet are bare. This general hails from the land of Chu. King Xian of Wei enfeoffed him as Grand Marshal of the Armies. His nature is upright and stern, detesting evil; he wields both authority and power, commands and subdues, and executes with decisive action. Skilled in leading troops into battle, he has rendered meritorious service time and again. King Xian issued an edict commanding him to lead the army, where he faced the Three-Battle Jiang Jie King of Wuya, dividing his forces to array in formation. Alone, he clapped his hands and charged into battle, yet suddenly, amidst the ranks, he perished in the fray, his qi spent. He vowed to return to the service of the Three Heavens’ Gate, becoming the Golden-Armored Valiant General. Later, Master Zhang of the Great Cavern memorialized his extraordinary valor, and he was appointed to lead troops under the altar’s banner.

The Manifestly Responsive, Demon-Subduing, Tiger-Headed Primordial Spirit Great General, Geng Wen, styled Zi Ze, wears a tiger crown. His face is half-red, his eyes white. He dons a black robe, holds a blade in his right hand, and lets a white gaiter hang down. His feet are bare, though sometimes he wears hempen sandals. This general is a man of the Tang dynasty. At the Purple Tenuity Grotto and Cloud Palace, he served as the Tiger-Attendant Spirit, originating from the northern lands, where he fed exclusively on termites. His nature is steadfast and gentle, yet when he presented a precious memorial, he was intercepted by a hundred demons. Stirring his courage, he raised his voice to summon the demon-subduing hosts. Thereupon, the Perfected Lord of Demon-Dispelling Celebration descended, leading a myriad of demon-subduing soldiers to serve under him. The demons were thus compelled to submit, and he achieved a minor merit. Unaware of his own resolve, within the Black Yin Zisi Temple, he brandished his blade and split several great beams, chewing through the termites within the wood without number. The temple’s monks entreated him to stay. Wherever the sound of the general’s voice reached within the temple’s halls, termites would take flight and fall dead to the ground. Later, Master Zhang of the Great Cavern memorialized his归附 to the Northern Culmen.

After reciting the above incantation, chant the Heavenly Vanguard Incantation and the Jade Emperor’s Precious Laud to augment divine might and act with fierce resolve.

**Hand Seals for Practice**
Upon completing the ritual reception of the edict, formally memorialize the Northern Emperor and request the command of the marshal, specifying the time and place for embodiment and practice. Prepare the summons talisman and official writ, and only proceed after the marshal has been duly petitioned.

Select several pure and upright youths to stand before the altar. Remove all miscellaneous objects from the altar space, lest the marshal’s ferocity damage them—items such as blades and axes must be stored away. Prepare only three peachwood staves, blazing incense, talisman paper and brushes, cinnabar, ink, spirit money, and paper horses to meet the marshal’s needs. At the appointed time, purify the space, transform the spirit, summon the generals, and state your intent as usual.

**Sealing Incantation for Embodiment**
When the ritual master acts, first trace a well-character (井) in the air above the ground, then visualize the character *jīn* (聻) within it. Next, have the youth stand atop the well, imagining it to be ten thousand fathoms deep, with black *qi* billowing forth, engulfing the youth within.

Then, using the sword mudra above the youth’s crown, trace the nine characters of the *guāng yáng chí diān guàn fàn lǎn fú shè* in the air, still visualizing the *jīn* character within the well. Recite the incantation:

The nine characters shake heaven and earth,
shaking heaven, the celestial gates turn,
shaking earth, the terrestrial portals split.
Reverently invoke the Great Star of Fusang, the Seven Ladies of the Eastern Dipper,
seal the youth, the thousand-mile numinous child,
the wondrous sagely divine maidens and warriors—
hasten the living soul from the body,
the divine *qi* to attach to the form.
Urgent, urgent, as the law commands!

With this method, visualize the youth’s cinnabar field *qi* rising to the crown, then draw it into your own life palace. Thereafter, perform the ritual actions upon the youth’s face and proceed according to the method.

**Incantation**
Heaven and earth, sun and moon,
water and fire in union.

Summon the upper and lower clouded souls,
unyielding as iron.
Urgent, urgent, as the law commands!

With this method, form the *zi-wu-mao-you* mudra over the youth’s face, then apply the incantation and mudra in sequence.

**Incantation**
Fire and heaven, limpid and profound,
the youth’s soul wanders, lost in darkness.
Urgent, urgent, as the law commands!

After reciting this incantation, draw the *qi* of the northern *zi* hour and blow it into the water. Then visualize the water filling with dreadful black *qi*, spray it upon the youth, and imagine the black *qi* shrouding the youth from sight. Next, recite each incantation to hasten the process.

**Swift Elbow Method**
Whenever a youth’s soul proves difficult to attach, employ this supplementary *elbow talisman method*.

**Talon Talisman (also called the General’s Thunderbolt Talisman)**
**Incantation**
Black *Mo* utters the decree,
roaring, summoning the Four Upright Ones.
Command the Northern Pole General:
wind and fire descend upon mortal form.
Unite *qi* to seal the mysterious truth,
nine talismans in emptiness, one in substance.
Fierce and mighty, manifesting awe-inspiring might,
vanquish demons, sever black lightning.
Transmitted by the Great Teaching’s decree,
disobedience invites thunderbolt retribution.
Urgent, urgent, as the law commands!

**Secret Incantation**
Oṃ.
*Fen fen le le jí jí.*

This method invokes the command of the Northern Emperor’s incantation and must not be used lightly. If attachment remains elusive after prolonged effort, the master should transform into the Northern Emperor—hair unbound, barefoot—assuming a wrathful countenance. Inscribe this talisman upon a fire dragon, visualize thunder and lightning erupting violently on all sides, and burn a gold coin before the possessed youth. Then, with the sword mudra, trace the talisman in the air while reciting the incantation over the youth’s face to swiftly secure attachment.

**Restraint Method (also called the Hidden *Gang* Method)**
After completing the *gang* steps, form the *zi-wu* mudra, draw the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, and blow it upon the afflicted person. With the mudra, strike them repeatedly until they collapse. For severe possession, demonic frenzy, or when the youth’s attachment turns unruly and defies control, employ this *hidden gang restraint method*.

**Internal Cultivation Formula**
Abide in great stillness and silence. Draw a breath of *qi* from the northeast and swallow it into the spleen palace. Next, visualize the black *qi* within the kidneys ascending to the spleen palace, where the two *qi* merge to form a single black orb. Direct it downward into the *Xuanming*, guide it through the *Weilü* point, and ascend straight to the *Niwan* palace. From the Earthly Portal below, exhale a black orb to meet your own, fusing them into one. Swiftly wield the sword mudra or the Dipper mudra to cleave it open, revealing Marshal Chen standing at your side. Then recite the summoning incantation, the secret incantation, and the esoteric incantation. Visualize above the *Xuantian*: Marshal Chen descending from the Northern Pole’s imperial presence, riding golden-black *qi*. Combine the ten-character secret incantation with the mudra to merge them into a single, awe-inspiring force, ready for command and deployment.

**Primordial Supreme Unity’s Divine Thunderbolt Method**

Vice Marshal Wen, whose taboo name is *Zan*, appears in ghostly form, with ox horns upon his head, left hand holding a water wheel, right hand wielding a sword.

**Incantation:**
A golden pellet pierces the Purple Tenuity,
Its full celestial might enters the profound mechanism.
Captured lightly in the palm, gently raised—
The Six Harmonies and Qian-Kun are held in one’s grasp.

**Invocation (to be recited on the ninth day):**
The lunar radiance weaves jade,
Essence and spirit nurture all life.
Green cassia and yellow blossoms assist,
Lush and pure, they guard the numinous.
Strange forms divide at the hair’s crown,
Comet tails may pass in secret.
From their stations, fortune and misfortune flow—
Through fasting and cultivation, the unseen stirs.

**Secret Mantra:**
□ gaze □ the Great Constancy, urgent.

**Golden Crucible Fire-Agitating Formula**
With the right method, draw a well-shaped character (井). Then inhale *qi* through the nose in one breath and swallow it, visualizing lung *qi* entering the kidneys—metal generating water—transforming into the moon. Liver *qi* enters the heart—wood generating fire—transforming into the sun. Visualize the sun descending and the moon ascending, the two poles intertwining and churning, returning to the central earth, merging into a single golden pellet. After a long while, let it ascend straight to the crown of the head, where golden light bursts forth, swirling across the heavens. The adept uses their gaze to gather the sky and earth into one mass, coalescing into a radiant golden-red glow, distinctly above the adept’s head.

**Jade Cauldron Simmering Formula**
With the right method, use the moon, always positioned where the *Xu* Dipper points. Visualize *Pojun* as large as the Dipper, its red light like the sun. Use the cauldron to swiftly draw it in and swallow it into the heart, then close and hold. Swallow a mouthful of saliva, sending it to the central palace. Visualize the fire blazing like boiling water, within which the five characters transform, emerging in sequence from behind the adept’s crown into the void to perform their work.

**Three-Character Method**
For praying clear skies, brush upward; for praying rain, brush downward.
For rain, use the *Zi-Wu* Dipper; for clear skies, use the *Yin-Wu* Dipper.

**Two-Character Living Method**
This is the phase of heaven and earth merging—emerging, descending, striking the *Ji* and *Bi* constellations.
This is the phase of heaven and earth’s purity and tranquility.
The brush’s touch traces the path of the *po*—the symbol of separation between humans and ghosts.

**Tide-Rising Water-Gathering Green Dragon Rolling Formula**
Visualize liver *qi* entering the heart, merging to form a blue-green dragon. Swallow it into the deep sea, drawing water that surges like a tide, rolling upward into the void, spreading rain everywhere.

**Incantation:**
*Shui ling ting te luo leng han lu yi qi jiang she.*
*Bei Ming hei shui xu □ xia jiang she.*

**Tiger’s Roar, Departing Palace Blazing Fire Formula**
Visualize lung *qi* entering the heart, merging to form a fiery mist. Swallow it into the central palace, transforming into a golden orb. Within it stands a celestial soldier, shaking a fire bell, releasing flames to burn away dark clouds.

**Incantation:**
*Om.*
*Hūm zhà hūm zhà, jīn huǒ tiān dīng zhāng xìn she.*
*Jīn huǒ tiān dīng zhāng xìn, sù shāo kāi hēi yún jí.*

**Supreme Unity Vice-Marshal’s Thunder Command Secret Method**
**Position:**
Before the Northern Emperor’s hall stands *Gongsun Tai*, the envoy who severs wind, stirs clouds, and summons rain. He wears a crumpled golden gauze hat, a red headband, a jade-like face with three eyes, red hair, a red robe, a jade belt, and green boots. In his left hand, he holds a thunder wheel; in his right, he inverts a golden spear, standing within firelight.

**Summoning Incantation:**
*Om.*

**Incantation:**
*Hūm □ niè hūm dā hūm suō □ ní □ chì zhà suō hē.* (Three times)

After reciting the right incantation thrice, exhale the *li* and *zhèn* qi toward the *xùn* direction. Visualize the marshal drawing the *gèn* and *xùn* qi into union, inhaling them into the heart, then briefly closing and releasing them.

**Talisman of the Self:**
*Xū! Fire, by your decree, open the Gate of Heaven.*
*Immortal Metropolis, Hào-Luò, seal the Gate of Earth.*
*Open the Heavenly Thunderbolt, hold the Gate of Men.*
*Iron-armored flying lightning blocks the Gate of Ghosts.*
*Five-Thunder Fierce Officer Xīn Hànchén pierces the ghost’s heart and ruptures its belly.*

Silently recite the *Thunderbolt Hào-Luò Secret Incantation* three times:
*Thunderbolt, thunderclap, swift steps—ghosts tremble.*
*Thunderbolt, thunderclap, behead and annihilate celestial demons.*

Next, invoke the inner general’s name, then recite the *Uniting Lightning and Radiance Incantation of the Nine Emperors and Supreme Unity Primordial Lord* for slaying, summoning, and binding. Further apply the *Yīn Dipper* to absorb the Dipper’s light, and anoint with the talisman.

*Hóng Qí Jù Zhī Dì Dèng Xiè.*
*Dá Nǎ Zhà Mó Yē Xīn Zhì.*
*Fēi Qī Jīn Zhà Luó Zhāng Jué.*

For supplication, inscribe the character "田" (field) on the talisman—do not merge strokes. Within the "田" character, place the lower marshal’s title for activation, integrate the secret incantation, and anoint with the Dipper’s name. Then add two legs to the character, inscribe the three marshals’ names within, visualize their entry, and anoint with the three secret incantations.

Next, recite the *Talisman Consecration Incantation*:
*Great Master of the Three Heavens’ Great Law,*
*Thunderbolt, the First Venerable.*
*Cloud-Soaring Spirit Officer Jiàng,*
*Seizing the Five Pervasive Ones on high.*
*Lord of the Myriad Heavens,*
*Invoked by Nánchāng’s Immortal Elder.*
*By decree of the Jade Emperor,*
*Swift-Thunder Fierce General commands.*
*Breath churns mountains and rivers to boil,*
*Wrath darkens sun and moon.*
*Who dares defy this mandate*
*Shall be shattered like dust.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Lord of All-Heaven, Supreme Unity Emperor!*

**Talisman Activation Incantation:**
*The Heavenly Emperor’s inner secret*
*Commands the myriad spirits.*
*Where the imperial decree descends,*
*It is as if the Emperor himself marches.*
*Whoever resists*
*Shall be obliterated by the thunder-axe.*
*Om. Hūm hūm.*
*All gods bow their heads,*
*Myriad spirits obey the command.*
*Where the talisman arrives,*
*Officials must hasten to receive it.*
*No disobedience permitted—*
*Act with utmost urgency!*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Primordial Lord of All-Heaven, Emperor of the Origin!*

**Thunder Activation with Incantation:**
*In the East, ten thousand fathoms of blue—*
*The Eastern thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*In the South, ten thousand fathoms of red—*
*The Southern thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*In the West, ten thousand fathoms of white—*
*The Western thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*In the North, ten thousand fathoms of black—*
*The Northern thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*At the Center, ten thousand fathoms of yellow—*
*The Central thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed!*

After reciting the right incantation, vigorously summon the thunder’s power, dispatch the thunderclap into the talisman, then inscribe another "雷" (thunder) character.

**Incantation:**
*Heavenly thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth,*
*Earthly thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth,*
*Dragon thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth,*
*Spirit thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth,*
*Earth God thunderbolt shakes heaven and earth.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed!*

**Method of Practice.**

In profound stillness and great concentration, the practitioner directs the blue and red qi of liver and heart to intertwine and merge at the crown of the head. This qi transforms into clouds, exhaled toward the Xun direction. Then, behold the Gen direction where dark clouds gather thickly—suddenly, a great fiery calamity from the Xun direction plummets into Gen. The Marshal swiftly turns toward Xun, where all the thunder spirits assemble, bowing in attendance. The Marshal leads the host of generals to descend, and the practitioner inhales and exhales before the altar.

This method commands all thunder spirits; it may be employed for great matters but not for trivial ones.

**Incantation for Flying Sword to Sever the Rainbow:**
*Heavenly hūm □ spirit, xī chēn sāi □.*
*Lī niè wèi liè, gū hù náo nù □ yīn □ còu □ jìng dàn □, yàn zàn cí □ zhàng □ měng □.*
*Flying spirits strike and smite, severing the rainbow’s arc.*
*Divine might pervades the Three Realms—*
*Hasten, hasten, by decree of the Jade Emperor’s primordial law!*

**Method:**
With the left hand forming the jade script mudra and the right hand holding the sword mudra, silently recite the preceding incantation. Visualize the thunder spirit under command, draw the northern qi, and blow it onto the sword. Before ascending, wield the sword to strike, then summon the primordial qi in a single surge, shouting: *"Heavenly General, sever the rainbow!"* And it shall be severed as commanded.

The adept traces from *si* (巳) to *wu* (午), releasing fire. Visualize a Dipper-sized blaze upon the earth. The adept treads upon the flame, incinerating the body, transmuting into the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

Next, from the crown’s gate, a divine infant bursts forth. From the space between the infant’s brows, a flame erupts. The adept swiftly draws it into the nostrils, then exhales through the mouth onto the brush. Recite the incantation to summon the two marshals before the altar. Visualize and unite with the two generals of the Xun Palace, descending to stand upon the incense.

By decree, summon the fierce marshal Xin Zhi, the Great God of Silver Fangs and Wind-Fire, to arrive swiftly. Hasten! As the Jade Emperor’s command compels.

Use only this talisman to hasten the process. This talisman may also be inscribed with *Fire Dragon Armored Steed* and a spirit-script stroke, then burned for greater efficacy.

**Commanding Thunder Incantation:**
Ah-tan-ti-tan-□-po-ti-tan-□□-sha-li-xiu-li-xiu-ah-po-da-li-lei-ga-po-lü-□-po.

Swiftly summon the Great Thunder, the Second Thunder, the Third Thunder, the Fourth Thunder, the Fifth Thunder to arrive at once. O Six Maidens of the Dark Master, *Po-fan-hei-qi-li-di-yin-di-du-da-di-sva-ha*.

**Secret Incantation for the Three Marshals to Raise Thunder:**
Zha-chi! Demonic thunder, hasten! Swiftly depart with lightning, command my Rain Master, summon my Wind Earl, set my thunder chariot in motion, wield my thunder axe.

**Further Hastening Incantation:**
Thunder that shakes heaven, thunder that shakes earth; a soft sound *de-de*, a great sound □□, a joyful sound *ji-ji*, an angry sound *le-le*, a coming sound *ji-ji*, a driving sound *bi-bi*, a gathering sound *hei-hei*, a dispersing sound *suo-suo*. By the power of my vow and might, may divine force descend. Soaring across the eight directions, come and heed this single clap. Hasten! As the Jade Emperor’s command and the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign’s decree.

**Edict for Issuing Commands:**
Solemnly, the first thunder shakes heaven, thunder roars and lightning cracks. Swift as lightning through mist, devour demons on sight. You act by the Three Clarities’ mandate; I act by the Jade Emperor’s command to compel and seize. Issue the order, rebuke and dispatch all marshals to action. Blow wind toward the *Xun* direction. Exhale thunder toward the *Zhen* direction.

Inhale lightning from the *Li* direction, lashes of the eyes. Exhale rain toward the *Kan* direction. Draw *qi* from the divine direction:
*Jia-Yi* at *Chen*, *Bing-Ding* at *Mao*, *Wu-Ji* at *Zi*, *Geng-Xin* at *Shen*, *Ren-Gui* at *Wu*.

The two preceding secret talismans: whenever performing rituals, first inscribe these two talismans onto the memorial document and burn them. Then write two more talismans and burn them at the appointed time to hasten the dispatch of the documents. Place the two great spirit talismans beneath the altar. Invoke the talisman of Marshal Xin, immerse it in the water vessel, spray and sprinkle, and infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water.

**Inner Secret of the Heart-Method:**
When performing the Jade Tone Thunder Summoning, employ the preceding method: circulate the fiery *qi* of wrath throughout the body, emanating from the crown to summon two generals. Combine with two generals from the *Xun* direction. Write talismans and recite incantations in a single breath, swiftly and with the force of thunder. Clap the command, shout the rebuke, and act upon the water in the vessel.

First, invite the *qi* of fire and water into the vessel—fire first, then water—circulating the fire *qi* to transform it into water *qi*, merging water and fire. Next, infuse the *qi* of the Celestial Stem into the water, stirring it to absorb the water. Spray and sprinkle toward the direction where the thunder deities reside. Clap the command to summon, rebuke, and dispatch them to act. Inscribe talismans according to the day and direction, drawing *qi* to infuse them.

In this method, first let the fiery light burst forth from your own eyes, transforming into a sudden flame, then into Marshal Xin of Heaven in the void. Next, visualize yourself as Envoy Zhang, transmitting the Jade Emperor’s edict to issue commands. With your right hand, write the character *xu* (虚); with your left, write *zhang* (张). Visualize your wrath as fiery heat, cover your ears with both hands, uniting inner and outer forces so that water stirs and fire ignites.

First, take two small sheets of blue paper, write *xu* and *zhang* on each, roll them into pellets, and insert the *xu* pellet into your left ear. Visualize black *qi* emerging from your right ear as rain. Clasp your hands in the thunder formation, grip firmly, gaze with wrathful *qi*, and strike once to issue the command. Use a black banner inscribed with the Northern Dipper, recite *Xin Zhi*, affix seven gold coins, and one great talismanic horse. Write the subsequent talisman on the horse, burn it, and recite the incantation. Open your eyes and mouth, marking them with cinnabar.

The master says: When the mind stirs, clouds and rain readily gather. One must practice restraint to preserve the spirit-*qi* in its entirety before proceeding. No memorial need be submitted; with a settled mind, the celestial *qi* clears, and clouds cannot coalesce.

**Inner Work of the Mysterious Capital Thunder Hub:**
Each night at the *Zi* hour, don robe and sit in stillness, banishing all thoughts. Click the teeth, close the eyes, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly visualize the five viscera as chambers of gold and jade. Click the teeth to gather saliva, fill the mouth, and swallow it into the cinnabar field. Swiftly lift the perineum. Repeat this three times nine, until the ninth repetition. Tightly contract the perineum without releasing, sensing the *qi* surge from the earth throughout the body, ascending to the muddy pellet. Visualize yourself as the Cinnabar Prime Lord, riding purple clouds to appear before the Emperor and present your petition. Upon receiving the decree, summon the cloud hosts to descend to the deep sea and draw water. Lift the perineum again, ascending along the spine to Kunlun, then slightly release the perineum. Once the response is received, proceed with the memorial and ritual.

**Rain Response:**
A sensation like insects crawling on the crown, moving to the forehead and itching—when the aperture itches, clouds and rain arrive. The body itches with steaming heat—thunder and rain approach. The forehead feels cool and damp with sweat—rain is imminent.

**Thunder Response:**
The heart startles, the ears ring with thunderclaps, a faint sound lingers above the crown—thunder resounds. *Qi* surges with panting—thunder crashes.

**Clear Weather Response:**
Body and mind feel cool and clear—clear skies. Heat and dryness—clear weather. Movement above the crown—clear skies.

**Wind Response:**
The crown and forehead feel light, cool, and breezy—wind arises.

**Method of the Left and Right Demon-Subduing Marshals Gou Bi of the Thunder Gate: Five Thunder Oral Formula**

Recognize the root of the Primordial Supreme Ultimate,
Then from the Supreme Ultimate establish Qian and Kun.
The dragon calls forth cinnabar fire to descend from the void,
The tiger inhales the Yellow River to surge straight upward.
The ears blend thunder and wind, opening the Xun gate,
The eyes fly forth lightning, shattering the Thunder Gate.
A single thunderclap leaves no trace to seek,
The moon shines on the cold pool, naturally inhaling and exhaling.

**Transformation Mantra**
Oṃ. Nata, deity of the North.
Oṃ. Cata, kṣip.
Swiftly conceal my body, instantly transform into a celestial perfected one.
Visualize as an exalted perfected being—*hasten as the law commands!*

**Visualization of Golden Light**
Command the Fire Spirit General—*hasten!*
Visualize the Heavenly Pass in Li.

Solemnly summon the Thunder and Lightning Left Direct Attendant, Great Black Deity Marshal Gou, riding fire clouds, driving a fire dragon—*swiftly return to the left of the altar.*
Visualize the marshal descending from the Heavenly Gate, borne upon crimson-golden *qi*.

Oṃ. Black Mist Spirit Ji□, Water Spirit—*hasten and subdue!*
Solemnly summon the Thunder and Lightning Right Direct Attendant, Black Dew Great Deity Marshal Bi, riding black clouds, driving a black dragon—*swiftly return to the right of the altar.*
Visualize the marshal surging from the Earthly Portal, borne upon silver-white *qi*.

**Internal Cultivation**
In great stillness and serenity, focus on the Primordial Cavity. Visualize golden light transforming into a bright moon, ascending from between the kidneys straight through the crown, transmuting the body into an exalted perfected one.
Next, visualize within the clear water below the navel the Heavenly Pass and Earthly Pivot in union: the tortoise facing north, the serpent facing south, their mouths emitting blue and white *qi*, which emerge from the navel to intermingle with the external dual *qi*.
Absorb and swallow this, directing it into the Primordial Cavity, where it divides into the kidneys—blue *qi* to the left, white *qi* to the right—then merges with the central yellow *qi*, coalescing in the Yellow Court at the navel.
Next, circulate the heart-fire downward to refine this coalesced *qi* into a formidable radiance, forming the Purple Gold Elixir.
Guide it through the spine, ascending past the multi-storied tower to the crown. Draw pure *qi* with the nose, lifting it from the root of the nose to surge upward. Visualize the two deities riding red and black *qi*, emerging from left and right to converge with the two generals descending from the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal. They stand within the golden light, suddenly uniting into the Inner Elixir, which is sent into the Original Cavity—*great stillness.*

When inscribing talismans, perform seven rapid eye-flicks, recite the Golden Light Mantra once, visualize the spirit transforming into an exalted perfected one, and with an eye-flick, summon the two generals. Visualize the external generals descending to converge and act.

**Spirit-Mobilizing Talisman**
Oṃ oṃ □□ hūṃ dī qián □□ *subdue*—grasp the *chou-wei* dipper, visualize silver color, combine, and blow into it.

Oṃ fu lián gāng shén *subdue—descend, spirit!*
Recite: Oṃ fu líng qí jī shén *subdue—constantly used.*
Recite: Oṃ niǎo nuó zhè zhì *subdue.*

**Mysterious Attachment to Water**
Clench the fists, enter great stillness, stand in *ding* posture, stir the tongue until the mouth fills with water, swallow three times to the navel, then send it downward with a double contraction, stirring the daily-accumulated fire elixir. Rotate with the thunder contraction, sensing a thunderous sound rising straight up. With an eye-flick, manifest lightning and fire within the water, then infuse it.
First visualize the water as a black sea. Wait for the lightning to enter the sea, where it flashes with the sea-bottom’s white light. Dimly perceive Marshal Bi riding a black dragon within, surging and churning. Witness golden waves rippling, lightning and fire ceaselessly intertwining, dazzling the eyes with clarity. The water seethes and boils ten thousand fathoms high. Inhale it, first striking from behind the head with a contraction, then divide the mouth’s water into two sprays. Visualize black mist surging from below. Swiftly merge the remaining mouth-water from the front, transforming it into golden light that descends from above. Visualize it entering the body to perform its work—*the youthful attendant vanishes.*

**Refining and Summoning the Marshal**
When refining the Marshal, first compose the spirit and settle the will. Visualize the Yellow Court—the Central Palace—where a distinct clod of yellow earth appears. Tilt the head back, draw the yellow qi of the Central Heaven into the heart through the nose. The heart’s fire ascends to meet it, then is pressed downward by the external yellow qi into the Central Palace. The internal yellow qi rises to meet the fire, generating it. The three qi merge, all becoming yellow qi. Gather and exhale it upward through the mouth, sending it to the Central Heaven, where it coalesces and descends. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace.

Again, mobilize this mass of golden-yellow qi, exhale it forcefully to the earth, dispersing it to fill the cosmos. All persons, self, and things vanish, leaving only thick, abundant yellow qi. With the right hand form the Sword Mudra at the waist, and with the left hand circulate the Thunder Mechanism through the kidneys. Thunder surges from the spine to the ears, cleaving the yellow qi. Flying fire bursts forth, revealing the Marshal within. The adept turns slightly, inhales, and draws the beam of light from the Marshal’s brow into the Cinnabar Field, passing through the coccyx. It merges with the golden light between the two kidneys, then surges up the spine to the Mud Pill, where it transforms into golden light. The adept inhales this golden light through the nose and exhales it to envelop the Marshal.

When deploying the Marshal to execute intentions or inscribe talismans, if the refinement is habitual, condense the golden light into a pellet, gradually shrinking it to the size of a star. Inhale it through the nose into the Central Palace. When needed, extract and employ it.

**Summoning Incantation**
Reverently summon the Fierce Marshal of the Year Lord: at the call, hasten to arrive—swift as shooting stars, rapid as wind and thunder. Dispelling clouds, seizing lightning, hurling fire and meteors, the yellow banner leads, the leopard tail follows. The seventy-two seasonal nodes, the twenty-four qi, the twelve prohibitions—malevolent sha take the fore. Encountering demons, sever them by the inch; meeting ghosts, obliterate their forms. Ahead, dispel the Nine Uglies; behind, annihilate mountain sprites. Flying dragons, earthly anomalies—subdue and pacify the Star of Literary Brilliance. I now summon and invoke you: descend with utmost urgency. Defy the Emperor’s command, and be extinguished by wind and fire.

Reverently summon the Fierce Official of the Earth Bureau, Yin Jiao: hasten to arrive, by the August Emperor’s statutes and decrees.

Clasp the Jade Mudra and silently recite:
*By the Heavenly Talisman, the Star Maid’s Decree of Slaying and Seizing.*

After the incantation, visualize the Marshal’s arrival. Proceed according to the matter at hand, then inscribe the talisman.

For the talisman on the right: draw a mouthful of Central Heaven’s yellow qi,
Envelop your body below,
Visualize it transforming into the Earth Star Lord.
The master closes both eyes,
Imagining the yellow qi transmuting into a yellow-robed Daoist,
Head adorned with the Earth Star crown,
Barefoot,
A yellow earth dragon coiled at the waist, forming a dragon belt.
Gaze fixed ahead,

Shouting: “Yīn Jiāo, act according to my command and depart afar!”

**Dipper Mouth, Demon-Queller Divine Official Secret Method #2**

**Incantation**
The vermilion-robed messenger attends the Golden Portal,
The green-faced gentleman descends to Purple Tenuity.
My own livelihood has few disciples,
Yet a single Primordial Lord rises and follows.

**Secret Essentials**
In silent stillness, qi flows ceaselessly.
Visualize the red qi, visualize the Cinnabar Prime.
Penetrate the Mud Pill Palace, ascend to the heavens.
Spread the golden bridge, manifest the Seven Primes.
The Demon-Queller descends, red qi swirls,
Merging into one.
The secret name is suspended.
In the midst of indistinctness, one’s own qi coils.
Swiftly inhale, gently swallow.
Receive it in the Primordial Palace, refined by true fire.
Again, raise it before the glabella.
Golden light appears, illuminating boundlessly.
Execute the Flying Sword Mudra without delay.
The golden light splits—all officers are complete.
In practice, focus is paramount.

**Right Mudra Method**
In profound spirit stabilization, first project the Zi-Wu Dipper in the void of emptiness. Visualize within your Cinnabar Prime Palace a mass of golden-red light, transforming into the form of a solar wheel. Ascend the layered towers, spread the golden bridge, and rise from the Mud Pill Palace to the Dipper’s mouth. The Demon-Queller Star looms vast, descending to merge with the solar wheel. At their center appears the syllable *hūm*. Suddenly, a streak of silvery-white light from the west pierces the golden-red radiance. Swiftly inhale it into the Heart Palace, hold it briefly, then exhale through the Mystic Gate. The light remains golden-red, filling the cosmos. With your right hand, part it with the sword mudra to reveal Marshal Ma standing upon a wheel of fire, his face green with three eyes.

When attending the Dipper, he wears the Golden Heavenly Ding Crown, his hair crimson, clad in a scarlet robe with wide sleeves, sleeves tied with a green immortal sash, and vermilion shoes. When subduing malevolent spirits, he dons an iron helmet, a red headband, a red surcoat, golden armor, a green immortal sash, and green boots. His left hand forms the Dipper Mudra, his right wields a fire sword. A white serpent spits fire from its mouth, fleshy horns grow from his head, and divine officials surround him. The marshal stands within golden flames, his body a thousand *zhang* tall.

When refining officers, inhale into the Cinnabar Field and stop. For regular use, raise and merge the Heavenly Marshal of the Upper Prime into the talisman.

**Talisman for One’s Own Body**
Recite the summoning incantation, inserting the officer’s name:
*Yang* □□□□□□□ *yin* □□□□□□□, all within the Zi-Wu Dipper.
When subduing malevolent spirits, add this destructive character and recite:
*Ōm* □ *dì hóu zhà hóu nà dì zhī xī lì suō hē. Ōm hǒu hǒu fēn sù xiàn suō hē. Hasten, hasten, swiftly!*

**Zi Character Proceeds Through the Twelve Branches Mudra**
Return Zi to the talisman, Xu to Si enters Chen, return Si to De.
Still recite the secret incantation:
The Northern Dipper, divine and numinous, the Dipper’s handle star—
Greedy Wolf seizes evil and devours spirits,
Giant Gate blazes with dazzling radiance,
Store of Prosperity gallops through mist, commanding heavenly soldiers,
Cloud-Soaring, Literary Star shines with light,
Integrity’s majesty, Martial Brilliance,
True Person of the Auxiliary Star,
The Heavenly Stem Great Sage of the Demon-Queller,
Honored Star of the Breaking Army—
The Heavenly Gate is sealed, turbid qi congeals.
The Emperor wields the battle-axe, grasping the Heavenly Ding’s might.
With a single shout to the south, gallbladders shatter and hearts topple.
Divine officials and inspectors, heed and seek the sound.
The Nine Provinces’ Earth Deities, each called by name, execute and behead the wicked.
Those guilty are not lightly punished; the wicked die, the kind live.
Sever heads, cut off feet, pound their forms to dust.
Demons and goblins are annihilated, the human realm is at peace.
Expel evil, cure illness—when the talisman arrives, act accordingly!
Hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and commands!

**Right Talisman**
Visualize Marshal Ma, draw the talisman with the divine light-infused brush. Once complete, raise the golden light from the glabella, transforming it into a destructive character to enter the talisman. Exhale from the mouth, direct the gaze.

**Incantation**
The talisman mudra can illuminate the orifices,
Only then does the primordial spirit contain the mechanism.
Seizing the deceased causes swift descent,
Beheading malevolent spirits requires peachwood.
Flying the Dipper arises from audience,
Proper writing ensures protection and prayer.
The brush ascends in blazing yang,
Descends smoothly like falling rain.
There is further yin-yang subtlety—
In practice, all must be known.

**Meng Attachment Mudra**
The master forms the Dipper configuration with both hands, transforms the spirit, and summons Marshal Ma. Next, with both hands in the Dipper mudra, thumbs at the waist, step the *dang* pace. Once the right stepping is complete, shift the youth to stand upon the *dang*. Then, on the youth’s face and back, trace a *hūm* character in the void. Visualize the youth enveloped in golden light, and shout for Marshal Ma to swiftly attach.

**Seventeen-Character Divine Official Secret Method #1**

**Internal Refinement**
For all internal refinement, first rub the palms, knock the teeth, and swallow saliva thirty-six times each to separate the turbid qi downward. Next, open heaven and close earth twenty-one times each. From the eyes above to the Bubbling Springs below, rub with the left and right hands. Then recite the secret incantation:
Fire Emperor, Fire Spirit King,
Ma Sheng enters my heart.
The master visualizes heart fire emerging from the Mud Pill Palace to envelop the body. Next, recite the secret incantation:
Water Emperor, Water Spirit King,
Wang Wen Yuan enters my kidneys.
After the incantation, the master mobilizes kidney water, emerging from the Bubbling Springs to envelop the body. When water and fire meet, inhale both into the Central Palace and disperse them. Only sense a single gleaming red fire pearl within—when needed, exhale it.

**Talisman for One’s Own Body**
**Eight Trigrams Mudra**
Yin, Mao, Si, Shen, Dui, Wu—
From Wu, the Dipper is drawn upward from below.

**Unite the qi.** Enter profound stillness; visualize crimson qi emerging from the heart, ascending from the Mud Pill Palace to shoot straight through the Heavenly Gate. Within the golden light of the crimson qi descending from the Heavenly Gate, a golden talisman falls, merging with the inscribed talisman’s form. Sense the golden light flashing brilliantly.

For refining the spirit, at the Yin, Wu, and Xu hours, sit cross-legged. Rub the hands together until warm, then press the left palm to the right sole; repeat until warm. Then press the right palm to the left sole, twenty-one times each. Next, rub the hands together until warm and press them to both eyes, also twenty-one times.

Silently recite the secret incantation:
*Southern Crimson Emperor, Fire Spirit King Ma Sheng, swiftly descend true qi into my heart. Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!*

After the incantation, the master visualizes crimson qi descending from the crown into the heart.

Next, recite the secret incantation:
*Northern Black Emperor, Water Spirit King Wang Wen Yuan, swiftly descend true qi into my kidneys. Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!*

After the incantation, the master visualizes black qi entering through the mouth and descending into the kidneys, distinctly.

Then visualize heart fire emerging from the crown, descending from the left. Next, visualize black qi rising from the Bubbling Springs on the right, until water and fire meet. In a trance-like state, they merge into a single mass; the adept draws it in and swallows it into the Primordial Palace, sensing a single gleaming red light within.

His visage is of purple-black hue, with a full beard, round eyes, an iron headscarf, a yellow forehead band, golden armor, a black embroidered robe, and green boots. In his left hand he holds an iron chain, in his right a metal whip, and he rides a black tiger. Under his command are the Four Palace Black Tiger Great Spirits, the Three Caverns and Five Thunder Officials, and an army of celestial soldiers.

**Summoning Incantation:**
Subtle and wondrous, true emptiness—
The Zi hour: the Divine Empyrean’s mysterious communion.

By the Thunder Talisman, I invoke the True King of the Divine Empyrean’s decree—
Hasten! Summon the Orthodox Unity Mystic Altar Grand Supervisor, Golden Wheel Marshal Zhao Gongming to arrive swiftly.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Upon reciting the incantation, inscribe the jade script with the left hand while holding the Thunder Talisman in the right, then place hands on hips. Flash the Jade Brilliance from the eyes nine times, visualize the lightning’s radiance from the southeast, and draw it in to merge with the Thunder Spirit of the Central Palace’s cinnabar field. Transform the Five Qi into wind, clouds, thunder, rain, and lightning, then raise them forth. Manifest as a golden light emerging from the Xun portal, uniting with the Marshal as he descends, leading his host of generals before the altar.

Next, recite the summoning incantation again:
Oṃ.

Oṃ. Mani thunderfire seize. [Recite] thrice.
Oṃ. *□□lī yè hóu lī sòu shā* seize. [Recite] seven times.
Oṃ. *Niè□ niè□ □□□□□□□□ sòu shā* seize.

**Command Talisman for the Chief Marshal**
Summon Zhao Gongming to manifest swiftly:
Oṃ. Thunderfire roar—swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Divine Empyrean True Sovereign’s statute and ordinance.

The Sun Palace’s Solar Emperor strikes at dusk upon the Divine Empyrean True Sovereign the Great Emperor.
By the Jade Emperor’s decree, bind the ghosts; visualize leading the golden light into the talisman.

To seize malevolent spirits: use *xū*; to smite them: use *fá*.
The Three Marshals’ fire burns the ghosts.
Zhao Gongming’s Samādhi True Fire lasso—swiftly bind the ghosts.
State the intention, visualize the marshal entering the talisman.

Enter the later character trigram incantation and Dipper Rite.
The south’s bing-ding burns hot as fire; the north’s ren-gui chills like ice—blow [missing characters].
Yin, wu, si, wei, wu, shen, xu.

[Missing characters] Deploy the incantation:
Om. Wu-su-ti, swiftly the Emperor comes.
Swiftly the *ga* comes, the *yakṣa* comes.
Wielding blades, brandishing swords, they come; raging, roaring, they come; hair unbound, they come; thunder roars, lightning flashes, they come.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Fork-headed lads and maidens, who bewilder and delude.
Manifesting as apparitions, they traverse provinces and counties, dispelling misfortune, dissolving lawsuits, pursuing souls into dreams.
A million raging soldiers, from the four directions and eight quarters, each and all come forth.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Like the cave’s raging soldiers, like armored temple warriors descending into the grotto—twin topknots, like the Brahmin immortal’s whistle-leg.
Apply the incantation:

Flying Celestial Divine Kings, the mighty essence of si.
Wu’s divine power spans heaven and earth; zi’s qi blankets the Three Clarities.
Mao, I command with one summons; yin, I roar *lu-ji-chi*.
Wu’s cinnabar *lu-li-chi*; wu’s *he-ruo-li-mi-chi*.
Xu, swiftly call *pan-di* [missing character].
Zi, by authority, slay and subdue.
Hai, perform the Thunder Formation thrice.

**Opening Light Talisman**
When inscribing talismans, first execute the yin-wu-xu mudra, then trace the wu mudra above the talisman. Silently visualize the five directions’ five-colored qi merging to form one’s true body, only then may one concentrate the spirit and proceed.
By the authority of the Solar Emperor, Divine Empyrean True Sovereign, and Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.
By the authority of the Divine Thunder True King, summon Zhao Gongming to arrive instantly.
Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire, Thunder Fire—Samādhi True Fire.
Om hum hum [missing characters] *she*, wheel, by authority slay and subdue, radiant and blazing, seize.

Execute the yin mudra. Internally gather the five qi, spiraling them forth from the seven orifices to merge with the north’s native black qi, transforming into Xuantan’s black qi—a tiger pursuing the tiger, passing through wu to enter the Solar Palace. The petitioner follows zi to wu, inhaling and absorbing the Solar qi, then infusing it into the talisman. Visualize the five-colored qi filling the talisman; when merging qi, draw it into the cinnabar field. To open the light, exhale into the radiance.

Upon completing the talisman, first sprinkle pure water on the paper, then on the medium, commanding the medium to stand beside you. Employ the talisman’s incantations to summon the generals, compelling them to obey your intent. Then pass the paper over incense to fumigate it, burn the talisman within, and affix it to the wall. Next, form the sword mudra with your right hand and trace it in the air above the paper, activating the talisman while visualizing the generals upon it.

Next, inscribe the secret characters: *Om hum ling su guang she ru fu*.
Then recite the esoteric incantation:
Heaven and earth, sun and moon, give birth;
light swiftly manifests form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Venerable Patriarch’s *tongguang* seizes.

Next, employ the following incantation to hasten the generals’ manifestation:
[Missing characters] seize.

Upon completing the incantation, if the medium is possessed, disperse the general’s qi and blow upon the medium’s crown and wind gate.

**Heaven’s Three Winds, Fire, and Solitary Thunder Great Rite #2**
**Presiding Ritual Master**

The Venerable Patriarch, the Purple Yang Master of Penetrating Mystery Bestowed by Imperial Edict of Guangdong, Hong Tianxiang. **Presiding General**: Zhao Gongming, Commander of the Five Directions’ Swift Seizure of Wind and Fire.

Descending from above, the earth’s gate splits the heavens.
At my single command, your numinous power is stirred.
By the Emperor’s decree, swiftly seize with flying qi.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

With the right hand’s sword mudra, trace the *xun* trigram in the air above the ground to the southeast. Split the *xun* trigram with the sword mudra—the earth’s gate cracks open with a thunderclap. Wind and fire rage, lightning flashes, and Marshal Zhao appears amid thunder, lightning, and fire beside the Heavenly Gate and the *Kuigang* star, descending on black clouds from the *xun* direction to receive his orders.

**Repeated-Character Incantation** (used for interrogation, binding, and summoning):

The right foot summons thunder and lightning; the left foot stirs wind and fire.
Axe of Jade *Kuigang*, divine and numinous, seize the *Zi-Wu* Dipper.

Thunderclap Marshal wields the binding rope.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

To the talisman’s right, add the decree for *Kuigang* Zhao Gongming,
commanding the Five Peaks’ mighty spirits to swiftly seize.
Clasp the slaying mudra, draw the *qi* of the northwest,
visualize the Marshal’s hand holding the golden rope,
which follows the brush to form a noose.
Once the talisman is complete, add the following:

First revolution: seize mountain *xiaos*.

Third revolution: seize the Six Spirits.
Fourth revolution: seize household kin.
Fifth revolution: seize all improper demons, ghosts, and malevolent spirits—
those who hear my *qi* shall be slain,
those who hear my *qi* shall be destroyed.
Clasp the slaying mudra.

**Dispatching Incantation**:
Thunder-Commanding Great Spirit, Thunder-Envoys and Perfected,
City Gods and Earth Rectors, White Prime Lord,
Jade Bureau Immortals, Zhou Youzhen, and all spirits—
hasten like the radiance of sun and moon!
The lesser ghosts of the Six Heavens flee in terror.
Should any passage remain obstructed,
seize them and consign them to the Capital Thunder’s flames below.

poisonous dragons and iron tigers patrol without end.
Swiftly, swiftly, obey the statutes of the Highest Divine Radiance True Sovereign.

**Secret Method of Thunder and Lightning, Earth’s Only #3**
**Commander-in-Chief**: Thunder and Lightning Earth Deity, Commander Wen Qiong.
Green-faced, with green beard and hair, golden headband,
long green kerchief, golden rings, green-and-white striped robe,
iron hat slung behind, iron armor, white silk trousers,
hemp-woven sandals, wielding an iron whip or bone mallet,
amidst thunder, fire, and lightning.
Above him, a thunder drum; a yellow-kerchiefed strongman,
half his body in the clouds, holds a yellow banner,
above which is the Thunder and Lightning Earth Deity Bureau.

**Summoning Incantation**:
*Om.*

"Hūmā hūní hōnglīdáluó, fly talisman, swiftly seize.
Eastern Yín: Mount Yue’s Jade Action, Lí’s command;
Southern Wèi: Jade Master, Zǐ’s Imperial Jade Numinous Lí Spirit.
Sì’s decree, Chén’s summons: Kūn’s Wēn, Duì’s Qióng;
Mǎo: swiftly manifest the Highest True Sovereign’s form.
Wǔ: emerge! Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

This is called the Interlocking Dipper. It may be used in water, on talismans, or by a youth—grasp the Mǎo seal.

**Talisman of the Self’s Body:**
Right eye quakes the moon, left eye shakes the sun.
Wēn Qióng, obeying the Supreme Emperor’s decree,
mouth spews jade fangs towering ten thousand *zhàng*,
body clad in golden armor, luminous and spirit-seizing,
right hand wields a bronze mallet like thunder’s roar,
left hand grasps the world’s unrighteousness and casts down evil.
Right foot treads thunder and lightning, left foot treads Mount Tai.
Left and right, lightning flashes—ghosts have no escape.
The Five Sacred Emperors of the Marchmounts, as commanded, act.

Recite the talisman incantation:
*When the Northern Emperor holds power,
might and spirit are fierce.
Black horses gallop forth,
shaking heaven and earth into stillness.
Thunder Lords and thunderclaps,
lightning flashes bright.
Left and right, officers and soldiers,
swords and polearms like clouds.
Seize and bind ghosts and spirits—
those who defy me perish!
Swiftly, swiftly, obey the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees!*

**For summoning the general:**
In searing flames, burn incense. With the sword mudra, trace the characters for "thunder" and "lightning" in the air above the incense smoke. Visualize within the smoke thunder rumbling and lightning flashing, a golden beam ascending—there appears Marshal Wēn, rising from the lightning, above the incense smoke. The adept gazes with both eyes, recites the *Northern Emperor Holds Power* incantation once, then issues the command. Visualize a great thunderclap shaking the void, Marshal Wēn descending from the incense smoke before the altar, his body ten *zhàng* tall, surrounded by dense azure clouds. With focused intent, write the talisman, dispatching and deploying him. With both hands, form the Thunder Bureau at the kidneys, channeling thunder to burst from the ears. Spray a mouthful of water, imagining the thunder’s roar driving him forth as the marshal departs through the air.

**Binding Incantation:**
*Wūchuò wūchuò.*"

**"Binding Spell of Wūdōng Soft Malevolence"**
*Wūdōng ruǎn shà chuò fùshù.*
*Chì Wēnqióng sù fù fèngxíng.*
*Jíjí rú lǜlìng.*

**Earth-Axis Stem Incantation and Mudra**
*Dìzhóu gāng, dìzhóu gāng.*
*Wind-Fire Mighty Spirit, swiftly turn your hand—press down with stone. Hasten!*
Clasp the Malevolence Talisman, draw the Northern *qi*.
*Chìlìng kuí gāng wēilíng sù shè.*
*One breath, twice repeated:*
*Míngméng míngméng hūn dùn yǐn tóng shè.*

*Yínwǔ dǒu.*
*First shake the primordial spirit, second seize the hawk spirit, third capture the hidden essence, fourth bind the radiant soul, fifth shake the Five Peaks.*
*Jíjí rú lǜlìng.*

**Sitting Meditation**
Ten thousand miles without a wisp of cloud,
the autumn sky holds a single moon.
Its reflection bathes the jade-green pool in cold—
above and below, both limpid and clear.
A spring surges from the Jade Dragon’s palace,
fire blazes in the Cinnabar Phoenix’s cave.
The Five *qi* merge in spontaneity,
a single pearl coalesces from this.
Auspicious light shines through to the depths,
a golden rainbow severs the center.
Push the carriage of Āxiāng—
faintly, thunder rumbles forth.
Bear me to Kunlun’s heights,
where the mid-heaven’s light gleams bright.
One who knows the heart-seal’s truth—
why need flying talismans or mudras?

**Internal Refinement Formula**
For internal refinement, first enter profound stillness, visualizing one’s body—inside and out—utterly unstained by a single speck of dust.
Next, visualize the two eyes: the right as the moon, the left as the sun, their light radiant and pure. Direct the twin luminaries to shine upon each other, converging at the kidneys, both equally limpid. Raise the murky, black *qi*-water of the kidneys upward, lower the blazing fire of the heart downward. When water and fire meet, circulate the Five Viscera’s five-colored *qi* to intermingle in the Primordial Cavity—the navel—fusing into a single pearl, amber-hued, resplendent in shifting hues. Press it down into the Cinnabar Field and guard it.

**Summoning and Attachment Formula**
For operational use, first form the Thunder Bureau with both hands, rub the Kidney Hall, and mobilize thunder to stir the *qi*, rising from either side of the navel like thunder’s roar.
The inner pearl of the Cinnabar Field ascends above the navel, revolving like a golden thread piercing the Posterior Heaven. The aperture within the kidneys—this pearl transforms into a golden light, a threefold entity within, leaping and glowing as if about to take flight. From the *Jiāchūn* point, it enters and ascends straight to the Wind Palace, then bursts forth from both eyes as golden light into the incense smoke, resembling a butterfly’s dance.
The adept’s gaze, left-turning and right-shifting, fixes clearly upon it.
Next, take a copper coin, fan, or paper money, clasp it in hand, and envelop it with this *qi*. Transfer it to the spirit-medium’s hands, seeing the threefold entity enter through the medium’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.
Recite the preceding incantations, then use the Thunder Bureau to trace the medium’s face. Blow a mouthful of Northern *qi* upon them. When the medium’s hands grow numb and paralyzed, seize the object from their grasp. Pass it once over the medium’s palm, then recite the Black Wind Incantation, visualizing it entering water.
With the left hand forming the Malevolence Talisman and the right the Sword Mudra, inscribe the Nine Characters in the air, swiftly reversing their order. Urgently recite the Roaring Incantation and the Iterative Character Incantation, drawing Northern *qi* to blow into the water. Dip the brush and write, visualizing black water churning, black *qi* billowing.
Next, lift the medium’s hands, baring their chest. The adept draws Northern *qi* and blows it beneath the medium’s feet, visualizing black *qi* rising in dense swirls to the waist. With the right hand’s Sword Mudra, part the medium’s face. Spray a mouthful of water, issue a command, and shout to the attending officers: bind them in black mist—a small infant appears at the top of the Cinnabar Field within.
Reunite them, visualizing the medium transformed into a ghostly form. If the spirit attaches, command the officers to administer ten lashes, then bind them with crossed restraints. Shout and roar distinctly, interrogating at will.
To awaken the soul, recite the *Yóu dǒu* incantation for soul-entry, the Sevenfold Veiling, and spray a mouthful of water. Visualize the ghostly form reverting to the medium’s original appearance. The adept’s left hand forms the Thunder Bureau, circling the medium’s Cinnabar Field seven times, while the right hand’s Sword Mudra rends upward from the Cinnabar Field. Visualize a thunderous roar in the medium’s heart, driving forth a golden orb. The adept inhales from the Cinnabar Field, and the medium’s crown awakens at once.

**The Thirty-Sixth Scroll of *Dharma Pearls from the Ocean of Methods* Concludes**
*Divine Empyrean Capital Commissioner, Golden Wheel Enforcer Marshal Zhào’s Talismanic Methods: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition.*

From *The Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 232, *Secret Methods of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar Marshal Zhào*:

Marshal Zhào’s personal name is Lǎng, styled Gōngmíng. A native of Mount Zhōngnán, he withdrew into the mountains during the Qín era to cultivate the supreme Dao. Upon perfecting his merit and conduct, he was summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Vice Marshal of the Divine Empyrean, assuming the offices of Direct Palace General, North Polar Attending Censor, and Supreme Commissioner of Imperial Mandates. Empowered to command the Three Realms, patrol the Five Directions, and oversee the Nine Provinces, he later received another edict to guard the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar during the Han Ancestral Celestial Master’s refinement of the Great Elixir.

His powers encompass driving thunder and dispatching lightning, summoning rain and calling winds, eradicating pestilence and severing malevolence, healing illness and averting calamity—none greater than the Marshal’s efficacy.

The following texts, collected in Scrolls 133, 240, and others of the same compendium—*Secret Methods of Mysterious Altar Marshal Zhào*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Golden Wheel Enforcer As-You-Will Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Flying Tiger Supervisor Marshal Zhào’s Secret Methods*, *Orthodox Unity Dragon-Tiger Mysterious Altar Great Method*, *Mysterious Altar As-You-Will Great Method*, *Highest Clarity Harmonious Wonder Dao Illuminating Primordial Five-Thunder Mysterious Altar Great Method*, and *Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar Marshal’s Six Yin Wild-Sleeve Dance Thunder Method*—all belong to the same lineage and may serve as corroborative references.

**The Heavenly Three Wind-Fire Lone Thunder Great Method**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition, this also derives from the lineage of Marshal Zhào Gōngmíng.

**Secret Methods of Thunder, Lightning, and Earth Deities**: Transmitted by the Orthodox Unity Tradition. According to *The Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 253, *Supplementary Discourse on Earth Deities*:

> The methods of the Earth Deity Bureau originated with the Vacuously Tranquil Celestial Master, then manifested through the transformations of Cave Master Wáng Zōngjìng of Tiānbǎo Cave, Perfected Officer Hào Dàoxiǎn of Qīngchéng, Immortal Liǔ Bóqí of Qīngzhōu, and Perfected Person Zhōng Míng of Guǒzhōu, who successively served as its custodial masters. Later, lineages such as Sū Dàojì’s branch, the Wēnzhōu Orthodox Lineage, Lǐ Péngtóu’s transmission, Guò Yàoqīng’s transmission, and the Xuánlíng Continuation flourished across Jiāng, Zhè, Mǐn, Shǔ, and the Hú-Guǎng regions—so numerous that their names cannot all be recorded. A thousand paths and ten thousand byways branched from a single source.

These methods thrived during the Sòng and Yuán periods. The texts *Secret Methods for Summoning Wēn Tàibǎo of Mount Dōngyuè* and *Great Method of Earth Deity Marshal Wēn*, collected in Scrolls 254–256 of the same compendium, likewise belong to this lineage and may serve as corroborative references.

**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of *Dharma Pearls from the Ocean of Methods* Concludes**
*Purple Empyrean Protector Five-Thunder Black Tiger Marshal Liú’s Methods*

**Commander-in-Chief:** Purple Empyrean Protector, Five-Thunder Black Tiger Marshal Liú, styled Wénxiǎn. His visage is deep date-red, with large phoenix eyes and sparse whiskers. He wears an iron fish-tail crown, a black headscarf, and black wide-sleeved robes, with yellow cuff guards tied at the sleeves and a yellow sash cinching his waist. His white silk trousers are bound at the ankles, and he wears black shoes, gripping his wrists while carrying a short-handled iron mallet. A black tiger attends his side, and reverse flames coil downward from his waist, encircling his body as he rides upon golden flames and fiery clouds. Under his command are the Six Dīng and Six Jiǎ, the Five Thunders, the Eight Malevolents, and legions of celestial soldiers.

**Internal Alchemy:** When the ritual master performs the rites, they must first purify with wine and burn incense to invoke the divine presence. Assuming the *shàngzhí* stance, they form the *shà* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, standing in the *dīng* position. They first recite the *Tàiyīn Huàshēng Zhòu* or the *Běifāng Xuántiān Zhòu*. They visualize within their *níwán* palace a radiant golden character *nì*, shining with luminous clarity. Next, they press the Thunder Formation firmly upon their heart, imagining the heart’s fire descending in reverse to the space between the two kidneys, stirring the primordial *qi* to surge upward. They then visualize within the heart an Upper Perfected One. Following this, they transform the primordial *qi* into crimson fiery *qi*, which ascends to the *níwán* palace, merging with the golden character to burst forth and ascend directly to the northern heavens. There, they behold the Marshal descending upon this fiery light into the void. The ritual master then briefly directs their gaze toward the *gèn* direction behind their elbow, where the earth splits open, and a black tiger emerges from the black mist. The master immediately forms the *yín* mudra and shouts the syllable *duō!*—whereupon the tiger prostrates itself before the right side of the altar. Seeing the tiger submit, the Great Marshal descends from the void and, accompanied by the tiger, awaits commands.

**Summoning Incantation:**
*"Black Tiger Great Spirit of Mount Wǔdāng,
Thunder roars to seize demonic spirits.
Leading three hundred thousand celestial soldiers,
The Dark Mist of the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor surges forth,
Mighty and fierce, manifesting divine power.
Six Dīng, Six Jiǎ, Eight Malevolent Generals—
Liú Wénxiǎn, hasten swiftly to the altar!
Great Spirit, Great Spirit, come with speed!
By the decree of the Teaching King, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor!"*

For writing, anointing, consecrating, or dispatching talismans, use the preceding incantation. Visualize the three characters *wén duì shà*, then draw the *qi* of the Celestial Gate to proceed.

**Personal Talisman:** Inscribe *"Rescue Black Tiger Liú Wénxiǎn, Primordial Auspiciousness"* and anoint with the *Tiānsuì Zhòu*.

**Thunder Sound Incantation:** *Ōm.*

**Talisman for Subjugation and Seizure:**
*"□ Dhāra □□□□ tī chì shà shè."*
Inscribe the right-side talisman with the preceding incantations in a single stroke. Layer the three characters *yuán hài jí duì xǐ shà* above the *xuán* character. Recite with the mouth, trace with the hand, and visualize three golden characters. Next, inscribe the petitioner’s name, imbuing the talisman with intent. Then visualize the character *niè* descending from the void into the *xuán* space, drawing it into the talisman. Recite the twelve-character Thunder Sound Incantation to envelop it. When spirits hear this, they tremble as though struck by thunder. Chant in a low, guttural voice, then seal the talisman with the *chì* character. Apply the Eight Trigrams with a tooth-mark, and the master silently intones *one*, envisioning the talisman radiant with golden light.

**Secret Method of Transformation by Marshal Wēn of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder:**
**Commander-in-Chief:** Marshal Wēn of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder, styled Qióng. His visage is that of a green-faced ghost, with golden eyes and four fangs. He wears a three-peaked hat, a red headband, a black robe with red brocade trim, a small golden sash, and yellow leggings. His chest is bared, a golden breastplate covering his heart, and he dons green boots. In hand, he wields a wolf-tooth staff, riding a white horse with all his generals in attendance.

**Summoning and Transformation:**
The master visualizes the transformation, inscribing the *ōm* character on the *mǎo* trigram with the left hand and striking toward the east. The character transmutes into azure-golden light and is drawn in. The adept exhales from the liver palace, transforming into Marshal Wēn’s attire and colors. Proceed as usual, reciting the incantation while tracing the *gāng*.

**Incantation:**
*Ōm.*
*"By the Northern Emperor’s revered command, the universal spirit is seized."*

**Arrangement of Trigrams for Seizure:**
*Chǒu zǐ duì kūn wèi wǔ sì chén mǎo*
*"Seize the spirit, universal and revered, by the Northern Emperor’s command—Ōm."*
*Mǎo chén sì wǔ wèi kūn duì zǐ chǒu*
*Ōm.*
*"Xiē yǐ dì lán tuó yē."*
*Chǒu yù lí wǔ chén sì mǎo*

Upon completing the incantation, inscribe a *□* character on the *mǎo* trigram and strike toward the east. Visualize this character as a wheel, its golden light revolving upon the earth.

**Secret Incantation:**
*"The Northern Emperor’s Purple Golden Wheel,
True qi follows the Queen Mother.
Nine orifices open the Dao’s path,
Ascending to the Great Flowery Palace.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

After reciting, the master stamps the left foot to mimic thunder, swiftly splitting the secret character with the sword mudra. Marshal Wēn manifests in form. The adept draws him into the liver palace, passing through the *wěilǘ*, uniting the two kidneys. Golden light ascends the spine’s twin passes to the crown, where an infant appears. Drawn into the liver palace, it exhales over the incense burner, growing into the Marshal.

**Personal Talisman:**
*"By decree, summon Wēn Qióng—hasten swiftly to descend!"*
Recite the *Northern Emperor’s Revered Command* while tracing the thunder array. Inscribe the secret character, infusing the Marshal’s presence, then layer the *chì* character to seal.

**For Dispatching Orders:**
First inscribe the talisman of the *Zhí Rì Gōngcáo* (Duty Day Attendant). Next, inscribe the personal talisman, then burn it with golden paper money and a horse effigy. Have the medium pass their hands over the incense, purify with sprinkled water, and summon the Marshal, visualizing him entering the medium’s hands. Burn a talisman, then inscribe the Marshal’s talisman upon the medium’s body. With the left hand on the *yín* trigram and the right wielding the sword mudra, write *ōm hōng niè zhà* to dispatch the talisman swiftly to seize. Seal with the *chì* character. With the sword mudra, inscribe *ōm hōng zhà là nà* to swiftly seize the flying soul. Write the *□* character and seal again with *chì*. With the left hand in the Dipper mudra and the right in the sword mudra, shout for the Marshal. Spread the five fingers, then shout for the generals and officials. Turn the hand to grasp the brush and state the matter as desired.

**Talisman and Mudra for Pursuit and Seizure:**
*"Solemnly summon Marshal Wēn the Great Guardian of the Azure Mysterious Earth-Thunder, leading his host: the Soul-Pursuing and Ghost-Seizing Yellow-Headed and Disheveled Envoys, the Mountain-Sealing and Cave-Breaking Ghost-Slaying Blood-Dripping Envoys, the Earth Deities, the Seven Slayers, the Spirits of the Dying, the Mighty Yin Soldiers, and all under his command. Hear my call and swiftly emerge from the mountain court! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

**Secret Summoning Incantation:**
*Ōm.*
*"Spirits, spirits—grim and dread,
Breath to breath, □□—come swiftly to seize!
By the Heavenly Emperor’s decree,
I summon the mighty and fierce gods.
Grim and dread, □□—arrive,
Host upon host, host upon host—come!
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

Upon completion, the master uses the right hand’s sword mudra to cleave open the earth’s gate. Black mist billows forth as the secret incantation is recited:
*Ōm.*
*"□□—grim and dread,
Swiftly manifest your true form!"*

One qi, seven cycles.

Upon completing the previous incantation, the master visualizes the black qi from within the earth’s gate surging outward, penetrating the Xun gate. Then, forming the *ti* mudra, he recites the secret incantation:

*"By the command of the Lord of the Sacred Peak,
Swiftly summon the mighty spirits.
Mysterious Gen, pure Qian, level Dui, settled Kan,
Zhen’s decree, Kun’s obedience—Xun’s law is suddenly fulfilled.
Before I finish calling Wen Qiong,
Hasten, hasten!
Ōm hūm hūm, ōm □□."*

*"By the Northern Emperor’s decree,
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

After reciting the incantation, he parts the Xun direction, and the Great Marshal of the Primal Qi stirs violently. The master inhales sharply, drawing the qi inward, clearly visualizing it entering his heart. Next, he envisions the black qi from both kidneys ascending through the *shuangguan*, passing the gallbladder, and reaching beneath the throat. The Marshal, riding this black cloud, is exhaled before the altar, merging with it.

**Talisman of the Self:**
*Swiftly, by the decree of the Divine King of the Divine Empyrean, inscribe the three auspicious characters "Yuán Jí Xǐ" in the Zi script.*
□□□□□□□ *Dǒu* (Dipper) in red, *Xìng* (Apricot) in ink, black-ground cinnabar, true *wà* (socks), *là* (wax), *Língbǎo* (Numinous Treasure).
*By decree, summon the Grand Guardian.*
*By decree, descend! By decree, summon Wen Qiong.*
*Ōm hūm hūm □□, grim and dread—swiftly manifest your true form!*
Visualize the general entering to report, then state your intent. Swiftly draw the qi of the Xun direction seven times, inscribing it upon the talisman with a single stroke toward Xun.

**Decree Incantation:**
*"By the command of the Lord of the Sacred Peak,
Leftward spin, rightward turn.
Follow the steps of Kuí and Gāng—
Qian and Kun instantly appear.
Grand Guardian, connect with the numinous,
Resplendent in ten thousand transformations.
Guǐ Xùn Dīng Rén,
Gather essence like an arrow.
By this decree, act without delay!
Ōm, spirits, spirits—grim and dread,
Breath to breath, □□—swiftly seize!
Ōm hūm hūm, ōm □□.
By the Northern Emperor’s decree,
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

Upon completing the incantation, apply the talisman and incantation of the Heavenly Divine Marchers. Invoke the Tianpeng incantation for secondary command.

**Talisman of Instant Attachment:**
□□□□□□□ *Tiāndīng* (Heavenly Divine Marchers), *Tiāndīng*—swiftly descend, connect with the numinous! *Wēnshǐ* (Wen Envoy), *Tàibǎo* (Grand Guardian), wield the punishing divine soldiers. By the decree of the Eastern Numinous, fire welcomes! Swiftly obey! *Wēn Qióng*, *Dīng Rén Guǐ Xùn*, gather essence like an arrow. Leftward step Kuí, rightward press Gāng—Kun instantly appears!
*"Heaven opens, mortals are lost—you enter! Ōm hūm.
Earth splits—seize! Ōm hūm nán—seize!"*
Visualize a lady in white robes and a golden crown, weeping as she enters the talisman, making a sound.

**Stellar Sequence:**
*Jiǎo, Kàng, Dī, Xīn, Wěi, Jī, Dǒu, Niú, Nǚ, Xū, Wēi, Shì, Bì, Kuí, Lóu, Wèi, Mǎo, Bì, Zī, Shēn, Jǐng, Guǐ, Liǔ, Xīng, Zhāng, Yì, Zhěn, Shí, Chén, Lù, Wén, Jiān, Wǔ, Pò, Yáng, Dǒu.*

For this talisman, draw the eastern qi (Mǎo script). It may be used for summoning, dispatching, fumigating the hands, or hastening commands.

**Incantation of the Decree Mudra Formation:**
*"Tiānróng Dīng Yǒu, Tiānshēn Dīng,
Wèi urgently, Wǔ descends, Sì connects, Chén numinous.
Wēn Envoy, Grand Guardian,
Wield the punishing divine soldiers.
Eastern Mǎo, numinous Chén, by Sì’s decree,
Wǔ fire, Wèi urgently, Shēn obeys, Yǒu marches.
Xū Wū, Nǚ Zhú, Zǐ Hōng, Chǒu Mō,
Yín Wéi, Dǒu Mǎo, Tuó Chén, by Sì’s decree—seize!
I uphold the Lord’s command,
Instantly attach to the living.
Dàn Wǔ □ Sì, Wēn Chén illuminates,
Mǎo’s Great Primordial, Chǒu’s Mysterious, Zǐ’s level.
Commanding soldiers to assist the Dharma,
The Three and Five Primal Lords.
Hài Wéi, Zǐ responds, Chǒu arrives, Yín’s path,
Mǎo Ōm, Chén Zhī, Sì Dā, Wǔ Tí.
Wèi Xū, Shēn □, Yǒu Mó, Xū Sà,
Hài Mó, Zǐ Yē, Chǒu Suō, Yín Hē.
Wēn Qióng, Grand Guardian,
Hear the summons—instantly attach to the living!
Swiftly!
I act by the decree of the Most Honorable Heavenly Equal, Benevolent and Sacred Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak!"*

Extract and employ the method—
The master abides in the eastern blue realm, lush and dense.
The adept draws forth the red qi from within the heart,
Descends to merge with the liver’s qi,
Then from the eyes emits purple qi,
Intertwining with the eastern blue qi, cleaving and descending.
From within the blue qi surges forth—
Swiftly inhale, then exhale with a *xū* over the incense.

**Attaching to the Medium**
First, inscribe three talismans.
Use one to summon and dispatch the marshaling generals,
Expressing the matter at will.
Prepare a basin of pure wood, recite the incantation while tracing the pattern,
Visualize the operation entering the water.
Have the child stand before the incense burner,
Sprinkle and purify.
Take one talisman, roll it into a ball,
And bury it within the incense burner.
Next, have the child close their eyes,
Fumigate their right hand over the incense.
The master swiftly recites the incantation while tracing the pattern,
Sprinkles the pure water onto the child’s hand,
Then presses another talisman into the burner.
After three to five repetitions,
The spirit naturally ascends—
Once the child’s fingers begin to stir,
Command the attending officer to turn their hand,
Grasp the brush, and report in writing.
The child must be literate.
If the possession is shallow, the spirit attaches to one arm only;
If deep, it fully ascends and writes.
Once the report is complete,
The child revives of their own accord,
No need to recite the awakening incantation.
If the spirit still does not attach,
Visualize a lady-in-waiting holding these golden characters,
Weeping over the incense smoke—
It will immediately come forth.

**Another School**
Commanding Marshal.

The Earth Deity of Mount Tai, the Illustrious Numinous and Radiant Martial Envoy, the Right-Assisting Marquis, Marshal Wen—named Qiong.
He wears a purple headscarf, has a green face, dons an official’s green wild-goose robe, black boots, and wields an iron whip.

**Internal Alchemy**
The master closes their eyes and visualizes a mountain on their right shoulder, enveloped in blue qi—this is the Court of Mount Tai. Next, with the left hand, they trace the Dipper of Chén and Xū, □□□□□□□, suspended in the void. They see the two stars Kuí and Chī transform into the celestial characters for "imperial decree," descending. The adept draws forth liver qi, exhales it over the incense, and it becomes a blue-robed youth holding a jade tablet. The youth receives the two golden characters onto the tablet, passes through Mount Tai, and with the golden light from the tablet, opens the gates of the mountain. Marshal Wen follows the blue-robed youth, riding the golden light as they arrive. The adept inhales through the nose, drawing them both into the liver palace. After a long while, the adept exhales over the incense smoke, and Marshal Wen manifests in full form. The adept then focuses their intent, draws the divine radiance from Marshal Wen’s body, and begins to inscribe the talisman.

The master next employs the Dipper mudra and the Sword mudra, recites the Northern Dark Heaven incantation and the Great Yin Transformation incantation, and visualizes the transformation into a perfected transcendent. Then they recite the summoning incantation:

*"By the Fire Mandate of Qian, united with luminous majesty,
The Emperor’s command descends—
The mountain marshal bears the charge.
I humbly summon Wen Qiong,
Hasten forth from the court of Mount Tai!
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

*"Dīng, Rén, Guǐ, Xùn—gather essence like an arrow,
Straddling Kuí and Gāng, Qian and Kun instantly appear!
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

*"The Wheel of the Northern Emperor, universally numinous, seizes and binds!
Oṃ. Sudṛdha, by command, slays and captures!
Hīṃ! Trailokyavijaya captures!"*

Each incantation is recited seven times in a single breath. The master traces the Mǎo trigram, draws forth eastern qi, and upon completion, silently visualizes the transformation into a perfected transcendent, secretly directing the proceedings.

**Talisman for Swift Report**
*"Left: The Azure Numinous Spirit hastens to communicate!
Right: The Metal Spirit of Kàng swiftly arrives!
Oṃ! The Wheel of the Northern Emperor, universally numinous, seizes and binds!
By the Fire Mandate of Zhé, united with luminous majesty,
The Emperor’s command descends—
The mountain marshal bears the charge.
I humbly summon Wen Qiong,
Hasten forth from the court of Mount Tai!
Dīng, Rén, Guǐ, Xùn—gather essence like an arrow,
Straddling Kuí and Gāng, Qian and Kun instantly appear!
Visualize Marshal Wen entering the talisman,
Proceed as you will to report the matter.
Hīṃ! Trailokyavijaya captures!
Oṃ! Sudṛdha, by command, slays and captures!"*

*"The Black Eastern General, by the Celestial Mandate of Mount Tai, issues the decree—
□□□□□□□, the Dipper stars: Greed, Giant, Prosperity, Literature, Integrity, Proclamation, Martiality, Destruction, Strife, □□□□□□□—
Each is traced in the Yín and Wǔ positions, ascending."*

*"The Emperor’s command is entrusted to me,
I entrust my command to you, Wen Qiong—
Hasten forth and manifest at once!"*

Once the talisman is inscribed, the master lifts the brush, forms the Thunder mudra with the left hand, and visualizes these golden characters descending from the blue clouds onto the mudra, leaping and soaring. Reciting the previous incantations, they strike the talisman with the golden characters from the mudra, envisioning thunder, fire, lightning, and a great clap of thunder—Marshal Wen proceeds with the task.

Next, the master recites the empowering incantation:

*"By the command of Jade Purity,
All spirits are restrained and governed.
Should any defy,
The statutes of Nǚ Qīng shall apply!
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

**The Flying Swift Fire-Thunder Envoys—Great Rite**
**Commanding Marshal**

**Thunderbolt-Bearing Decree, Flying Swift Fire-Thunder Envoy Zhang, styled Yuanbo.**
His form blazes like sudden fire, his left hand forms the Thunder mudra, his right hand grasps a black banner, and his body rides a fire dragon.

**Eight Trigrams Vajra Incantation:**
*"Om hum hum."*
*"Three Dāna, Qian-Yi Decree."*
- *Hai-Dui Palace commands the thunder troops.*
- *You-Gen Palace seals the demon gate.*
- *Yin-Gao Palace drives the fire wheel.*
- *Wu-North Sea surges with waves.*
- *Zi-Human Gate shakes the earth’s axis.*
- *Shen-Zhen Thunder swiftly resounds.*
- *Mao-Raging winds topple mountains.*
- *Si-All generals descend into my body.*

*"Slay the Great Numinous Perfected! Great Void Perfected!*
*By the Emperor’s decree, I urgently summon the Flying Swift Fire-Thunder Great Envoy Zhang Yuanbo.*
*Hasten to the altar, heed my command.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

**Heart Incantation:**
*"Bright spirit, bright spirit, I summon Zhang Yuanbo.*
*Ti zha wa □ decree—slay and subdue!"*
*(Recite once, then circulate qi three times.)*

**Internal Refinement:**
The master presses the tongue to the upper palate, closes the heart’s qi, recites the previous incantation once, and directs the heart’s qi-fluid downward into the Cinnabar Field’s qi-sea. Returning it to the left and right terraces, it merges with the True One’s darkness. Revolving the Cinnabar Field’s qi upward to the Crimson Palace, it suffuses the body until warmth is felt. If not, circulate again until full, then guide it to the Twelve-Storied Tower, with the mouth’s qi as verification.

Visualize the qi of the southeast—azure, red, and golden—descending. Exhale sharply to merge it into a single mass of crimson-gold fire-light. Inhale through the nose to gather it within. After a moment, when the spirit settles, exhale it onto the incense as a golden orb. With the sword mudra, inscribe:
*"By the Emperor’s decree, summon Yuanbo to swiftly manifest his true form!"*
Suddenly, the golden light splits open, and within the crimson qi’s chaos, Envoy Zhang stands before the altar.

The master then forms the Thunder mudra with the left hand and holds the brush in the right. Silently visualizing the marshal descending from the void, they proceed to inscribe the talisman.

**Personal Talisman:**
*"Open the Heavenly Gate, close the Earthly Door;*
*Hold the Human Gate, block the demon paths;*
*Pierce the demon’s heart, rupture the demon’s belly.*
*Yang left: □□□□□□□*
*Yin right: Greed, Giant, Emolument, Literature, Integrity, Martiality, Ruin.*
*Zi-Xin, Zi-Yin, Zi-Hui, Zi-Zhen, Zi-Lian, Zi-Wu, Zi-Geng.*
*Front feet tread wind,*
*Rear feet tread wind—*
*Hasten beneath the altar to receive the decree, summoning Thunder Spirit Zhang Yuanbo.*
*By command, execute the task.*
*On yin days, begin from the right: Thunder’s might strikes, startling all.*
*On yang days, begin from the left: Roaring, rumbling, swift and fierce, rescue and revere the decree.*
*Now, Marshal Zhang Yuanbo, act as you will in this matter.*
*Petition submitted on [year, month, day, hour] by [rank, name]."*

*Primordial True Sovereign, Nine Depths’ Numinous Qi,*
*I am the Wind Master, by imperial decree commanded.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Thunder-Light Fire Master’s statutes!"*

**Method:**
Use gold coins and spirit horses. Submit the memorial petition by burning it in midair, on roof tiles, or by virtual inscription, or cast it into a water vessel—use as preferred.

When burning the talisman, as smoke rises, visualize it transforming into clouds and mist. See the golden light enveloping the marshal as he rushes into the Heavenly Gate from the void. Shout: *"Act swiftly and report—no disobedience!"* Continue until the smoke dissipates. If the talisman flies upward, an immediate response will follow.

You must diligently uphold this.
Offer pure tea and jujube broth,
Burn peachwood incense.

To save all living beings.

Together we shall ascend on purple clouds.

**Life-Hastening Mudra for Added Efficacy**
The master exhales a breath of personal azure *qi* toward the southeast.
Where the *qi* arrives, a palace appears—
golden nails, vermilion gates.
At its steps, the Life-Generating Divine Youth,
clad in blue, comes forth to meet you.
Together, you proceed to the Dipper Mansion
of the parturient woman’s original destiny.
Having reported the matter,
you and the Divine Youth ascend once more
to memorialize the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Highest Emperor.
A blue-clad youth approaches,
bearing a single azure character: *Life*.
Then the Nine Heavens’ Birth-Supervising Great Spirit
is dispatched—one talisman in hand,
one brushstroke descending in a single stroke.
Recite the incantation and inscribe the talisman’s seal:

Whisper the secret name thrice, gazing toward *Xun*.
Twin eyes flash like lightning in flight.
Within the shadow of jade clouds, a golden bridge appears—
Marshal Xin is summoned and concealed within the gallbladder.

**The Peerless Severing Character: A Numinous Script**
The Perfected Master declares:
When the Three Powers were divided, the myriad things took form.
When the Three Powers transform, the myriad things are stored.
Thus, *yi* becomes *xin*, and *xin* becomes *yi*.
*Yi* in *you* is *yi-you*;
*xin* in *mao* is *xin-mao*.
Wood’s life begins in *hai* and flourishes in *yin*.
Fire’s life begins in *yin* and flourishes in *si*.
Metal’s life begins in *si* and flourishes in *shen*.
Water’s life begins in *shen* and flourishes in *zi*.
*Ren* resides in *hai*, *gui* in *zi*—
thus both can engender in *zi*.
Since Heaven’s One engenders Water,
and Earth’s Two engenders Fire,
fire flourishes in *si*,
and *qian* reaches *xun* to complete its six strokes.
From One to Nine is Heaven, yang, the sovereign.
From Two to Ten is Earth, yin, the minister.
*Yi* becomes *xin*—
thus the character’s stroke from One to *si*
is where the myriad things are divided and completed.
Within *si* lies *xin*—hence the surname *Xin*.
Two is the minister—thus called Heaven’s Minister.
*Han* is the pivot; *chen* is the mechanism.
What cannot be fathomed is the pivot-mechanism.

Envision Xin the Sovereign descending from the *xun* direction, astride a fire mule, accompanied by two yellow-scarved, green-faced warriors wielding fire axes, borne upon flames.

Next, recite the Urgent Incantation. Inhale through the nose to gather the *qi* into the gallbladder, sealing the union. Exhale with a *xi* sound before you, then inscribe the talisman as intent dictates. For daily cultivation, inhale to gather the *qi* into the gallbladder and cease.

For practical application, recite the Emergence Incantation:

**Talisman for Resolving Offenses Against Earth Deities**
*Thunder Bureau*

To the Earth Lords of the Five Directions, the Earth Treasury, and all earthly spirits and malevolent forces:

This Bureau respectfully invokes the *Nüqing Celestial Statutes*. In former times, during the first year of Yongshou in the Han dynasty, the Celestial Master convened at Lutang with the Year-General and the Lady of Great Yin, swearing an oath upon split stone that they would not imprison the people of the world, disrupt their dwellings, or bring forth calamities.

Now, as reported, the petitioner’s household, on such-and-such a day, undertook construction without discerning the positions of yin and yang, nor the directions governed by spirits and malevolent forces. Fearing transgression against the Year’s Slayer, the Monthly Punishment, the Hour’s Inauspiciousness, or the Day’s Ominous Portents—thereby secretly offending the Earth Treasury and provoking the Spirit Bureau—disasters and afflictions have arisen in rapid succession, with illnesses compounding and the heart gripped by terror, leaving no peace day or night. The petitioner humbly beseeches relief and resolution.

This Bureau, acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform and succor all beings, cannot refuse such a plea. Having already provided talismanic water for the afflicted to ingest and wear, and talismans to post upon gates and courtyards, we now issue this special decree.

Upon receipt, urgently comply with the Celestial Master’s teachings and admonitions, notifying:
Earth Lord Chén Yàxiān,
Yè Zǐliáng,
Zhāng Zǐguī,
Fire-Blood Hé Míngbó,
and the Six Jiǎ’s life-destiny spirits: Lín Jìngzōng,

Monthly Establishment’s Earth Subordinate Two Thousand Stone Spirits,
Three Hundred Sixty Great Malevolent Forces,
One Hundred Twenty Lesser Malevolent Forces,
Funeral Gate, Mourning Visitors,
Male and Female Pestilential Malevolent Forces,
and all evil spirits and malevolent forces.

By the Primordial One’s talismanic mandate, command them all to swiftly depart from the forbidden direction, ceasing their ancient obstinacy and desisting from wanton harm. They are further ordered to promptly withdraw their influence. Any lingering toxic *qi* shall be dispelled, and the afflicted shall swiftly recover.

Should the year, month, day, or hour prove inauspicious, they are likewise commanded to issue celestial talismans, transforming misfortune into fortune and calamity into blessing. Temporarily withdraw to other regions, then return to your proper positions and pacify your domains. Those who disobey shall face the law; those who transgress shall be punished. Urgently comply, that all beings and things may prosper and remain upright.

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll 38 concluded*
*#1 Secret Methods of Thunder Bureau Marshal Xīn: Transmitted by the Divine Empyrean Sect.*
*(The *Dharma Methods Compendium*, Scroll 81, includes Pan Songnian’s transmission of *The Great Method of Marshal Xīn, Bearer of the Wind*, belonging to the same tradition; may be consulted for reference.)*

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll 39*
*#1 Secret Methods of the Fengdu Western Terrace’s Radiant Spirit, Slayer of Demons, Pass Marshal of the Primordial*

**Commander-in-Chief:** The Fengdu Grand Virtue-Power, Heaven-Uniting, Earth-Governing, Radiant Spirit, Ghost-Slaying, Demon-Subduing Great General, Pass Marshal of the Primordial—personal name *Yu*, style *Yunchang*. He wears a green silk headwrap with long ties, his face the hue of deep jujubes, phoenix eyes, a flowing beard; clad in an official robe of green with wild-goose embroidery, his armor exposed at the chest, green-hung boots, riding a red horse, wielding a great blade.

**Internal Alchemy:**
For spirit refinement, first close the *qi* and draw in the *qi* of the northeast, then blow it forth. Next, visualize the northeast direction behind the elbow transforming into Fengdu Mountain, where a cavern appears, black *qi* surging within. Silently recite the mantra while forming the *Thirteen Golden Mudras*, then approach Marshal Guan. He emerges with blade in hand, leading his host; inhale and refine the *qi* into the heart, directing it downward to the inner kidneys. Close the *qi* and refine it, transmuting it into a golden character □. The practitioner tightly contracts the perineum, presses the knees together, and lifts this golden character upward with a breath, offering incense. When the Marshal fully manifests, the practitioner presses the left thumb upon the *sì* trigram, inscribing the Twenty-Eight Constellations to form the *Golden Numinous Character*, then flicks it forth to command and deploy at will.

Next, recite the secret mantra:
*Oṃ.*

"Slay the heavens at *chǒu*, hasten the *zǐ* of earth at *duì*, swiftly seize at *lí*. At *wǔ*, emerge—*Oṃ.* At *zǐ*, *hōng*; at *chǒu*, *hōng*. Within the central □, *duì* roars, *kūn* hastens, swiftly seize at *lí*. At *wǔ*, emerge.

The talisman of one’s own body—
The wrathful, thunderous might of Water’s essence-soul,
The radiant, numinous majesty of Fire’s true essence,
Marshal Guan of the Northern Capital,
Heroic and fierce,
With fifty million troops,
Banners arrayed in ranks—
Swiftly descend in divine might to annihilate demonic thieves!
Pursue them to the Eight Extremes, through the fourfold gloom of twilight,
With frost-edged swords and keen blades, sever ghosts and erase their traces.
Where evil exists, eradicate it; where ghosts lurk, strike them down!
By the Northern Emperor’s decree and the Eastern Peak’s command,
Heaven-shaking, earth-encompassing, retribution is clear and manifest.
Radiant Numinous General, swiftly descend to Fengdu’s camp,
Brandishing your blade, astride your steed, to slay ghosts!
Come forth in submission—ghosts who obey shall not be slain;
ghosts who resist shall be obliterated in form.
The slightest defiance or delay is rebellion against the Highest Clarity.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command!*

Four Slaying Talismans: □□□□□□□ *zǐ-wǔ* Dipper □ (□□□□□ *yín-wǔ* Ox,

Heavenly thunder rumbles low, dragon and tiger converge in charge,
Heaven-shaking, earth-dragging, resounding with crystalline clarity.
Year-slaying, month-slaying, day-slaying, hour-slaying—
all ghosts and spirits self-slay, slay!

White Emperor *na-gōu*, Emperor *na-xī*, *xī-na-lóu-lóu*, *tǎn-na-dī* (□ *na-bá-tóu*, *na-bá-na-shè*—

Decree to slay and seize! The incantation before the talisman is called *Qī-nà-bā-cha*, also known as the *Northern Emperor’s Heart Mantra*.

Recite the preceding *Thirteen Golden Character Mantra*, visualizing the general’s entry.
The Dipper turns, the *Big Dipper’s Handle* thunders, slaying and seizing—
proceed in accord with heaven, thunderously slaying earth,
seizing with the might of lightning!

Next, recite the *Celestial Encounter Mantra* and apply the decree to the talisman.
Once the talisman is complete, draw in the northern *qi* and blow upon it.

*Mantra for Inscribing the Talisman:*
Black smoke, black poison, mobilize yin essence.
*Thrust at wǔ, zǐ, Dipper*—black smoke, black.
*Thrust at zǐ, wǔ, Dipper*—slaying talisman."

The talisman on the right is sealed with *qi*, inscribed in a single stroke. Next, draw forth the *qi* of one’s own killing force. Then gather the *qi* from behind the elbow, visualizing the space behind the elbow as Mount Fengdu, towering and grim, shrouded in dense black *qi*. The marshal lies concealed within—inhale and blow upon the talisman.

*Mantra for Inscribing the Talisman:*
One *qi* transforms into virtue, water and fire seize essence.
Yang moves, yin responds—myriad spirits take form.
Crimson *qi* lingers, black smoke coils thick.
Grant me penetrating vision, piercing spirit to essence.
Summoned, they arrive at once, heeding the command to welcome.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and ordinance!

Once the talisman is inscribed with the above mantra, visualize it glowing golden and proceed to the *Gen* direction to summon the marshal. Within the adept, the water of the kidneys and the fire of the heart clash fiercely, forming crimson and black *qi*, which gathers in the gallbladder, exits through both eyes, and is directed into the talisman.

Next, recite the *Decree Mantra*:
Great Unity divine talisman, wondrous and spiritually potent.
Heavenly soldiers, heavenly soldiers—decree to restrain ghosts and bandits!
Protect all beings, subdue mountain demons and evil rebels.
Rain torrents, lightning bolts—malevolent spirits and corpse-possessors cower.
Rouse the divine encampment, execute and slay demonic evil.
Above stand the Seven Stars, governing demons and meting out punishment.
As is, in accordance with the Great Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and ordinance!

*Mantra for Dispatching the Talisman:*
The Great General Who Beheads Demons commands an army of divine soldiers.
Three thousand march ahead, countless follow behind.
Black clouds surge—execute and slay demonic spirits!
Whether kin or stranger, seize and capture them all.
Dare not disobey the command—act with haste, as I decree by the Jade Emperor’s law and ordinance!

*Urgent Summoning Mantra:*
I wield the Supreme Lord’s method to capture and bind all demonic essences.
Officers and generals of Fengdu, swiftly attach yourselves to me!
At my invitation, hasten to arrive; at my summons, swiftly descend.
Should any disobey, calamity shall befall your bodies.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Northern Dipper’s law and ordinance!

*Personal Mantra:*
*Fēi-fēi-lī-lī*, Lord Guan, fierce and mighty, wields his keen blade,
startling demons at dawn.
At my call, descend swiftly to the altar.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Jade Emperor’s law and ordinance!

Once the above mantras are complete, employ this method to possess the medium silently and without disturbance—capture and attachment occur at once. The master visualizes heaven and earth plunged into darkness, sun and moon eclipsed, imagining the black *qi* of the north surging forth. The marshal arrives at the altar, standing above the incense. Inhale deeply, drawing the *qi* into the cinnabar field, then blow it onto the medium’s face, eyes, and ears.

If the matter is urgent, use the following mantra; for minor affairs, it is unnecessary.

*Mantra:*

"Zhou’s fall marked the dawn’s end,
truly a matter of grave deceit.
Flaming as smoke in the heavens,
surging like radiant splendor,
Wucheng girds the divine peaks,
serene light engulfs the azure vault.
The Gate of Heaven overlooks the cinnabar well,
Cloud Gate stands towering and jagged.
Seven wrongs traverse the wondrous canopy,
linked and crimson, demons spread.
The Six Heavens block the northern path—

**Summoning Incantation and Death Warrant of the Northern Qi:**
*"Xi, Gong, Jian, E—Numinous Lords of the Jade Emperor. Together with the Four Generals, bind and interrogate gods and ghosts. At my call, descend with haste!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Fengdu Interrogation Decree!*

**Poetic Formula for Mixed Application:**
*"Two Dipper stars divide the execution decree’s song,
Two forms emerge to enter and rebuke.
When the heart-moon shines bright, the waist is the master—
The master ascends directly past the Mud Pill Palace.
Face front and fix the root position,
The Eight Generals encircle the altar in unbroken ranks.
Add Jiao and Zeng at the ear’s base,
Inspect the law, execute the sentence, and command with the mouth’s decree."*

**Method of Application:**
Press the tongue against the upper palate and gaze upward toward the crown.

Recite the Lesser Summoning Incantation, cross hands and press downward, gaze upward with both eyes, and visualize a skull. Draw pure qi through the nose and lift the "Golden Well." Inhale one breath of pure qi into the Cinnabar Field, envisioning oneself as the Master—crimson-haired, indigo-bodied, clad in black robes, or bare, seated in the Nine Uglies posture, a skull crowning the head, enveloped in a shroud of black mist.

Next, visualize the red and black qi of the two kidneys intertwining to form a golden talisman at the center, flanked by two generals on the left and right, with the Great General before and behind. Gently sway the paired passes of the spine, circulating the qi upward to the Mud Pill Palace. The Mystic Pearl emerges from the Kunlun summit. Envision the talisman ascending from the crown, the two generals emerging from the left and right eyes, while the remaining six generals issue from the other orifices to stand before the altar.

Internally apply the method in Crane Posture: first exhale the turbid qi from the mouth, dispersing it to the northeast, where it transforms into Mount Fengdu, beneath which lie six caverns encircled by seawater. Then cross hands at the flanks in the Execution Mudra, visualizing nine coiled serpents writhing before the adept. Envision the adept seated upon the serpents, eyes closed, perceiving a bright moon within the heart illuminating the kidneys below. As the kidney water and heart moon merge in radiance, the inner landscape unfolds—within the Fengdu Palace, azure and white qi intermingle, predominantly azure with traces of black. The Mystic Qi ascends from the spine to the crown, transmuting into the Eight Generals, who emerge from the adept’s eyes, ears, mouth, and nose to stand above.

Next, cross hands and press the legs, visualizing the qi of the Bubbling Springs—white on the left, black on the right—issuing from the Shoulder Wells to manifest Jiao and Zeng at the ears, flanking the left and right shoulders. When the adept opens their eyes, their body has transformed into the Perfected Lord Wei, coiled atop the nine serpents. Silently recite the incantation seven times, envisioning the external landscape of Fengdu’s generals converging from the execution qi. The adept swiftly forms the Sword Mudra with both hands, sweeping downward to gather the generals into one, arraying them before the altar. With focused intent, command and dispatch them to their tasks.

**Secret Incantation:**
*"By the decree of the Dark Netherlord, the Numinous Officer, Perfected Lord Wei.
Jiao and Zeng, Water and Fire, emerge from the Yang Ford.
Above, they bear the Emperor’s mandate; below, they succor ghostly souls.
O Black Spirits, Black Saints, malevolent ghosts and wicked sprites—
Aerial curses, earthly rebels—
Dispatch the Ox-Head Officers, summon the Yaksha deities.
Whether distant or near, whether old or new,
Nilu blazes with Fire, Zi-Wu channels Metal with Mo.
Wu-Wei whistles with Wind, Wei-Si hisses with Water.
Si-Zi, the Yin-Yang Generals and Officers—
When Zi passes Xu, the Sword Mudra is formed, sweeping them downward.
Seize and deliver them to the Dark Nether, swiftly as the Yaksha’s heart-seizing writ!"*

Seven repetitions.
**General Talisman Record.**

**Heavenly Decree of the Vast Sky:**
By the mandate of the Celestial Dipper, the Heavenly Officers and Generals, the Earthly Yin Soldiers, and the Water Bureau that governs the myriad spirits—
The Edict of Fengdu’s Great Emperor is issued.
Jiao Zhongqing deploys his left array to bind and seize gods;
Zeng Yuanxi commands his right formation to fetter ghosts.
Fengdu’s soldiers execute them from the front,

Wei Xi, Liu Yin, Wang Jian, Meng E, Che Zeng, Xia Xin, Lie Kai, and Sang Tong—
descend from the Gate of Heaven, emerge from the Earthly Portal.

**Edict, Talisman, and Incantation:**
The Northern Yin of Fengdu records all ghosts and spirits.
With legions numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands, the Eight Directions connect to the numinous.
It gathers the living and the dead, examines and summons ghostly souls.
All obey the talismanic command to seize and slay ghosts.
Banish them from the body, attach them to the body, annihilate their forms—
swiftly, swiftly, as the law of the Northern Emperor of the Great Yin decrees!

**General Talisman:**
Xi Yin, Jian E—
the Five Emperor Spirit Lords,
along with the Four Generals—
Wind spirits, hasten to arrive! Earth spirits, hasten to depart!
Peck at Kan, shriek at Kun, □ at Zhen, chirp at Xun, center at Qian, benefit at Dui—

The Twenty-Eight Constellations encircle the heavens, their stellar slayers aligned—
sealed by the Fengdu Great Emperor’s decree.
The Three Primordial Heavenly Lords, the Four Sagely Rotating Slayers enact their will.
The Five Directions’ divine soldiers, nine hundred million cavalry—
proclaim to the Nine Hell Wardens: hasten to descend!
*Oṃ chílín mó dá oṃ mó lín dá lín hūṃ tà suōhē.*

**Edict, Talisman, and Incantation:**
Heavenly Perfected Generals, Earthly Armored Gods,
Fengdu’s fierce marshals, blazing and valiant spirits—
I command you to swiftly depart and manifest your mighty power!
East to Fusang, south to Jambudvīpa, west to Maṇi, north to Uttarakuru—
far across the Four Great Continents, near within the span of a square inch.
Hasten to seize and bind the malevolent ghosts causing calamity!
Greatly display your power, respond according to the law.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole commands,
as the Fengdu Great Emperor’s statutes decree!

**Seal of Submission (fragmentary):**
□□□□□□□.
To the right, employ the sword mudra, inscribe in water.
□□□.
At the *hài-zǐ* hour.

**Method:**
Use the sword mudra to inscribe in water.
Next, draw the black wind from the *gèn* direction into the water,
visualize golden characters surging within it.
First, sweep the seated generals into the golden paper,
then have a youth hold it upright.
Next, visualize the □ character on the youth’s face,
the □ character at his navel,
the □ character at his feet.
With a sleeve, obscure his face—
only the sun’s light in his left eye,
the moon’s light in his right,
starlight between his brows.
Clasp the *hài* mudra, inhale, and plunge into darkness—
only the preceding characters remain visible.
Next, visualize a small child in yellow robes within his navel,
emerging from his crown.
The adept clasps the *zǐ* mudra and inhales—
only the □ character remains.
Next, visualize between the youth’s kidneys:
white *qi* emerges from his left toe like clouds.
The adept clasps the central mudra, sweeps with his foot—
the *qi* disperses like mist.
The adept inhales it—
only the □ character remains.
Swiftly inhale the slaying *qi*, fiercely blow upon the youth,
issue the command.
Visualize seven black *qi* characters threading from his nose to his navel—
see the youth in darkness, ghostlike.
If he does not submit, add the eight-character talisman.

**Method:**
Visualize the black waters of the Northern Sea surging forth,
inhale them through the teeth, exhale with a hiss—
visualize ten thousand shards of freezing ice.
Inhale the water, spray it into the air—
visualize eight golden talismanic characters arrayed in black mist,
descending to shroud the youth from sight—
only the eight golden characters remain visible above.
Next, recite the edict-incantation:
The Ten Gods of *Taiyi* govern the Ghost Gate.
Fengdu’s *Jiàn’è* and the Five Peaks summon souls.
The black waters of the Northern Abyss—hasten to descend!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree.

**Incantation to Urge Capture and Return the Soul to the Vessel:**

**Procedure for Practice:**
In all practices, first use one talisman to seal and summon the deluded spirit,
dispatch the generals to completion.
Next, take three paper money offerings, scatter and place them by the incense burner and water vessel.
The adept faces the paper money, sits in proper meditation,
enters deep concentration, and sweeps them into the paper money—
have the youth hold it before the altar and perform the rite.
Next, spray black water once to shroud and fell the youth.
Then command the paper money to be set down,
recite the generals’ summoning incantation,
shout the order for the officials to press the malevolent spirit into the body,
interrogate and compel it to state its purpose.
If delayed, take the *jiǎmǎ* command talisman,
rewrite the general talisman atop it to hasten completion.
Press the malevolent spirit into the bottle-prison,
or prepare a document to dispatch it.
**Incantation to Awaken the Soul:**
Primordial Lord, Primordial Lord—
the three *hún* and radiant *hún*.
The spirit-soul returns to its rightful place,
swiftly re-enter the human body!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree.
Visualize the adept absorbing the youth’s three lights—
the yellow *qi* below, the white *qi* within—
into one’s own cinnabar field.
When the matter concludes, visualize golden light,
lift and return it to the youth,
restoring his spirit.
Pat his crown, call his name—
he will immediately awaken.
Next, silently recite:
Heavenly Numinous Splendor, may you preserve long life.
The Supreme Mystery’s One guards the true form.
The Five Viscera’s Spirit-Lords each preserve peace.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree.

**Rite of the Summoned Dead’s *Gang***

Having completed the *Gang* to the right, I lead the Three Lights into the Kan Palace, pacing the Eight Trigrams to Xun, then retracing my steps along the Three Terraces. Facing the Gate of Heaven, I memorialize the Supreme Unity, await the decree, and recite the Supreme Unity’s invocation eighty-one times. Stepping four times through the Seven Stars... toward the Earthly Portal, I command the Jade Maiden of Nocturnal Radiance and the Five Thearchs’ Great Demons to bear banners and shatter the prison, visualizing the departed soul’s release from confinement.

**Incantation to Summon the Jade Maiden of Nocturnal Radiance:**
Oṃ. Śikālīṃ dikā diye.

Visualize the azure *qi* within the gallbladder transforming into a green-robed jade maiden, pearl in hand, emerging from the left eye to illuminate and breach the dark prison.

**Incantation to Summon the Five Thearchs’ Great Demons:**
Oṃ. Jvalu panka daye.

Visualize the white *qi* within the lungs transforming into a golden-armored general, grasping a five-colored treasure banner, pointing directly at the prison gate to guide the departed soul out.

Having performed the above method, recite the Golden Light Incantation and weave it into a golden bridge to receive the deceased. Absorb the banner’s essence or attach it to the youth’s body, proceeding as desired.

**Another Tradition:**
In all ritual practice, the master first paces the Nine Palaces to erect a Dipper of Vast Release. Next, he traces the mudra to shield his body and silently recites the Transformation Incantation:

With reverence, I invoke the Nata Spirit of Fengdu—
swiftly conceal my form, assume your shape.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes decree.

**Dipper Mudra.**

**Extermination Talisman of the Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches:**
*Yin* aligns with *Zheng*, *Chou* with *Ji*, *Zi* with *Guang*, *Dui* clashes with *Kun*, *Wei* with *Qin*, *Wen* with the stellar pattern.
With this mudra and talismanic script, circumambulate the body thrice to the left and thrice to the right.

**Summoning Incantation:**
Now, as incense is offered, I invoke and summon:
Commander-in-Chief Han, Marshal of the Inner Terrace Ai, the Great General of Beheading and Blood-Offering, the Two Spirit Officials Zeng and Ma, the Two Perfected Lords Jiao and Zeng, Marshal Guan of the Red-Haired Bright Pass, the Eight Extermination Generals—Wei, Liu, Wang, Meng, Che, Xia, Lie, and Sang—along with the Seventy-Two Examiners, the Demon Kings of the Three Caverns and Six Palaces, and all wardens, jailers, and spirit soldiers of the prisons. Let each grasp their implements of incarceration, array themselves to left and right, and heed my command.

**Second Summons:**
I call upon the luminous lords of the Five Emperors—
their blades sharp as mirrors, their armor forged of bronze.
At my summons, descend with haste.
By the authority of the Great Emperor of Fengdu, I so decree.

With this mudra, draw the *qi* of the North.

**Third Summons:**
With reverence, I invoke the Merit Officer for Expelling Evils, the marshals and functionaries of Fengdu, the Eight Extermination Generals of Cangues and Shackles, wielding iron staves, golden locks, and hammers, the Great Pillars of the Underworld, venomous serpents of gold, the Great Roc’s Deceptive Marshal, and all those who behead and offer blood—seventy-two administrative bureaus, internal and external jailers, and spirit soldiers. Follow me wherever I go to seize and bind spirits. By my ritual command, proceed first to hang and bind them, interrogate their circumstances, and subject them to lawful torture and examination. Bind them swiftly and bring them forth.

Hasten to obey!

**Fengdu Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes.**

The summons complete, form the *sha* mudra and draw the *qi* of the North.

**Method of Merit:**
*"The Azure Moon illumines the frigid pool."*

*Oṃ kṣi jī fù* [□□□] *she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)

Draw one breath of Northern *qi*, swallow it into the heart, and transform it into a bright moon. Let it descend to illuminate the kidney-water, a limpid pool where water and moon intermingle. Within the moon appears a palace, inside which is a [□] character. Raise it forth, and from the two eyes it emerges, splitting into two generals who stand to left and right. The adept commands the Nine Ugly Ones to serve them.

*"Black winds blow through the Xun gate."*

*Oṃ zhā zhuó jī* [□] *tuō* [□] *lī* [□] *sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)

Draw Northern *qi* and take several hundred paper coins. Visualize within the golden-black radiance a [□] character emerging from the northeast. Inhale it through the eyes, transforming it into golden light that issues forth to inscribe a talisman on paper. Have a youth hold it before and behind, tracing the characters in the air to bind the target.

*"Golden essence flies behind the elbow."*

*Oṃ jī lú* [□] *luó yín* [□] *chì sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)

Visualize the ground behind the left elbow. Fix the gaze upon it and, with a sword, cleave it open. Behold black winds surging forth bearing the character *shān*. Inhale them into a water vessel, where they transform into a black mist that envelops the youth.

*"Inverted gold hangs above the well."*

*Oṃ* [□] *líng tuō ní tí chì sha she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)

Draw one breath of Northern *qi* and swallow it into the cinnabar field of the kidney-water. Within it lies the character *shā*. Raise it to the two eyes, where it transforms into all the generals, who emerge before the altar to be dispatched for interrogation and torture.

*"Wind and thunder strike the earthen gate."*

*Oṃ yín shén tā shén sha shén dì she.* (Recite the incantation seven times.)

Draw one breath of Southern *qi* and swallow it into the heart, where it transforms into a sun’s radiance. Raise it to meet the kidney-water, and the body grows cold as ice. From the spine’s twin passes it ascends, employing the thunder wheel. Roll it past the kidneys and through both ears, producing the sound of wind and thunder. A [□] character emerges, cast forth with the thunder wheel to smash open the earthen gate. Summon the marshals and functionaries of Prefect Ai’s department to capture, pursue, and seize, exterminating great malevolences.

**Next, recite the Binding and Attachment Incantation Formula:**
*"Bing binds, Zi gathers, Chou shackles, Yin tortures, Mao fetters, Chen imprisons, Si burns, Wu tiles, Wei hangs, Shen beheads, You severs tongues, Xu breaks, Hai captures."*

**Incantation Formula for Attaching the Deceased Spirit:**
*"Míng míng xuán xuán hóng chéng* [□] *she."* (Recite seven times.)

**Next, recite:**
*"Black smoke and baleful poison convey golden essence."*

Upon completing the incantation formula, visualize the chariots of *Che* and *Xia* emerging to stand to left and right.

Next, visualize within the heart a moon as vast as a house, within which a luminous jade maiden appears distinctly. Envision a jade maiden holding a black banner inscribed with golden characters, arriving from the north before the adept. Once the intent is fixed, the jade maiden from the moon joins the northern jade maiden, merging into one. Together with the two generals, they proceed to the Xun gate. With the banner, they force open the prison door, and all spirits bow in reverence.

The jade maidens and two generals enter. In an instant, visualize the jade maiden now holding a yellow banner inscribed with black characters, leading the deceased forth. All generals and attendants escort them before the adept. Inhale the spirit’s *qi* and blow it onto the banner, attaching it to the person holding it. Then draw one breath of ghostly *qi* and again visualize the deceased spirit, blowing it onto the youth’s body.

**Talisman for Gathering at the Altar:**
*Xī* [锡] *jiàn è*
*Five Sovereign Spirit Lords*
*Zēng xīn kǎi tóng*
*Torture and bind ghostly spirits, pursue and seize the deceased.*
*For capturing the deceased, employ this.*
*"Wind spirits hasten to arrive, earth spirits hasten to depart.
Heaven’s noose binds, earth captures, fire—
The Three Officials and Five Sovereigns issue their statutes."*

Upon completing the talisman, recite the *Golden Light Incantation* three times. Infuse it with *qi* and burn it before the altar.

**Incantation Formula for Empowering the Talisman:**
*Oṃ kǎn zhā kūn zhuó zhèn jī xùn jiàn zhōng tuō zhá* [□] *duì lī gèn chì sha she lí chū.*

**Great General Talisman:**
*Xī chú jiàn è*
*Five Sovereign Spirit Lords*
*Together with the Four Generals, interrogate and bind ghostly spirits.*
*"Wind spirits hasten to arrive, earth spirits hasten to depart.
Zhuó jī pán tuó lán, spirits—seize!
Swiftly pursue, swiftly seize, swiftly bind—
regardless of great or small, whether malevolence or kin,
hasten to drive them forth!
Urgent as Fengdu’s Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes!"*

Form the *sha* mudra, draw Northern *qi*, and visualize the Eight Generals entering.

**Incantation for Empowering the Talisman:**
*"Spirits of Fengdu, spirits of Fengdu, hasten to descend!
Golden hammers wildly dance, iron staves cross and clash,
with shackles and breaking, with binding and seizing—
regardless of kinship, swiftly bind and present them!
Fengdu’s demon kings, gather at the altar and manifest!
Follow my ritual command—swiftly bind and present them!
Urgent as Fengdu’s Interrogation and Summons Ritual Statutes!"*

**Method for Activating the Command Tablet and Seal:**
The master first visualizes behind the left elbow, directing the gaze with both eyes. From the nose issue white and black *qi*; turning the head, observe the right elbow, where a stream of black *qi* rises to meet it. Perceive the rushing wind, inhale it, and hold it within.

Blow onto the seal and command tablet forty-nine times.

If employing a youth as medium, combine this *qi* with one breath of Northern *qi* and inhale it to spray onto the youth.

*Precious Pearl from the Sea of Ritual, Scroll Forty-Six, "Swift-Flight Secret Methods #1"*

**Chief Marshal:**
The Swift-Flight Responsive Messenger Zhang, named Yuanbo. His face bears a ruddy hue; he wears a crossed-scarf headwrap, a yellow headband, golden armor, a close-sleeved short robe, a wind-blown cloak with fluttering sashes tied at the knees, and green boots. He wields an iron axe and rides atop lightning and flame.

**Names of the Six Ding Spirits:**
- Dingmao Swift-Flight Shang Messenger, named De.
- Dingchou Swift-Flight Ma Messenger, named Guang.
- Dinghai Swift-Flight He Messenger, named Yantong.
- Dingyou Swift-Flight Bian Messenger, named Cheng.
- Dingwei Swift-Flight Li Messenger, named Cong’e.
- Dingsi Swift-Flight Zhang Messenger, named Congzheng.

The above six spirits all take demonic forms: snouted like swine, sharp-mouthed, with fleshy wings, purple hair, golden eyes, naked bodies, ruddy limbs, golden bracelets on their wrists, golden bands on their foreheads, fleshy floral horns, white skullcaps, crimson wind-cloaks, and green flying sashes. In their left hands they hold official documents; in their right, black banners inscribed with golden characters summoning the Thunder Gods. The banner-tails stream toward the Xun direction as they descend from the Xun quarter, riding golden lightning and flame in flight.

**Summons Incantation:**
Five Thunder Spirit-Generals, manifesting a thousand truths,
Commanding thunder and lightning, coursing fire and moving clouds.
From the five directions, *qi* descends—swiftly drive the thunder!
I bid you come before this altar court.
Obey my command and act—hasten, hasten!
By the decree of the Jade Clarity True King, swiftly, swiftly as the thunderfire statutes!

Upon reciting the above incantation, to summon the Six-One Spirit: First exhale a breath of primordial *qi*, visualizing heaven and earth merging into a single crimson chaos. Next, inhale a golden breath of lung *qi* to burst it open. Direct your gaze toward the west, where the Great One resides in the southwest Kun position. Employ the transformation to form a golden bridge, which surges from the nose to connect with the Xun gate. Suddenly, the Great One appears above, blending indistinctly with the messenger, descending together via the golden bridge. They stand amidst lightning and flame, awaiting commands.

When inscribing talismans, draw in *qi* to infuse the symbol.
When subduing malevolent spirits, wield the axe.
When summoning thunder, grasp the banner.
Both banner and axe are transformations of the Great One’s sword; the messenger assumes form through the presentation of *qi*, merging with the Great One.

**Official Document Format**
*Thunder Bureau*
*To the Bureau in Charge:*
This document is issued to address matters at a designated time. Now that the appointed hour has arrived, a summons must be expedited. The following is the official dispatch:

**Dispatch:**
To the Six-One Direct Talisman Swift Messenger, the Venerable Celestial Deity, and the Great Spirit of the Ding [X] Decade—[Name]—hasten to the Xun Palace and report to [specified deity] as instructed herein.
*Dated:* Year ___ Month ___ Day ___ Hour ___
*Sealed by:* [Rank] [Name]

For all dispatches and summons, the document must specify the direction in which the thunder altar is to be established, commanding that by [specified time], dark clouds gather, thunderbolts strike widely, true fire of yang thunder resound, and rain pour down in torrents, clearly manifesting the response.

**Post-Horse Direction Transformation Talisman:**
- On *Shen-Zi-Chen* days: *Yin* direction
- On *Hai-Mao-Wei* days: *Si* direction
- On *Yin-Wu-Xu* days: *Shen* direction
- On *Si-You-Chou* days: *Hai* direction

This method follows the decanal sequence, summoning from the direction corresponding to the day. *Yin, Shen, Si, Hai* are the lodges of the Thunder Duke. When invoking the thunder assembly, add the Big Dipper steps and dispatch the talisman.

For urgent and grave matters, recite the following sacred title:
*The Supreme Purple Void Primordial Sovereign Lady hastens here.*

In standard ritual practice, first invoke the primordial spirit and silently report to the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord before proceeding with the dispatch according to the method.

**Six Ding Messengers Talisman**
*Dingmao Messenger Talisman*

**Dingchou Messenger Talisman**
**Dinghai Messenger Talisman**
**Dingyou Messenger Talisman**
**Dingwei Messenger Talisman**
**Dingsi Messenger Talisman**

The six talismans above are to be inscribed on yellow paper with cinnabar ink. Within each talisman’s circle, write the name of the messenger corresponding to the current decan. After visualizing their entry, apply the *Om-Om Han-Han* incantation to consecrate them.

**Talisman Consecration Incantation**
Heaven is round, earth is square;
Six pitch-pipes, nine odes align.
Where the divine talisman arrives,
Myriad ghosts submit and hide.
Six *Ding* messengers, hasten forth,
Responding to the transformation of the *Kuigang*.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Nine Heavens’ Mystic Woman.

**Ritual Method**
Perform the rite at dusk, facing the direction of the Dipper’s handle as it points at midnight. Around the first watch (*zi* hour), lay a clean mat upon the ground, arrange the spirit tablet, and complete the offerings. The master dons black robes, wields a sword, lets down his hair, and stands barefoot. He then visualizes his primordial spirit and silently reports to the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord. Afterward, he transforms his spirit and silently recites the *Celestial Peng* incantation seven times, envisioning himself as the Celestial Peng.

Next, he steps the Nine Stars’ *Gang* and stands at the center to proceed. First, he summons Attendant Zhang and entrusts him with the task of summoning the Six-One spirits. After burning Attendant Zhang’s talisman, he then summons the Six *Ding* Messengers according to the method, silently reciting the *Om-Om Han-Han* incantation as he burns each of the six talismans, calling their names one by one. The ritual proceeds in order, following the prescribed offerings.

Upon completion, bury the paper ashes, tea, wine, and offerings in the *Xun* direction, marking the spot with the sword. The next day, dispatch the summoned spirits according to the original method.

On the talisman’s face, inscribe the Six-One Spirit Talisman; on its reverse, write Attendant Zhang’s name. When inscribing the talisman during the rite, use chicken blood mixed with cinnabar powder.

When ascending the altar to perform the rite and inscribe talismans, have a single attendant—pure and refined—stand by. Avoid the presence of the old, young, monks, nuns, women, livestock, or those with malignant illnesses.

**Offering Formulary**
**Dingmao Swift Attendant Shang**
Offer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, candles, flags, incense, dried venison, and straw sandals.

**Dingchou Swift Attendant Ma**
Offer with wine, rice, fish, fruit, paper flags, candles, dried venison, and straw sandals.

**Dinghai Swift Attendant He**
Offer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper candles, floral flags, dried venison, and straw sandals.

**Nine Heavens Supreme Unity Moon Comet Thunder Sovereign**
Offer with wine, fruit, tea, a seal, sword, mirror, incense, candles, and the talismanic banner for summoning thunder spirits.

**Dingyou Swift Attendant Bian**
Offer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, a sheep’s head, flags, candles, dried venison, and straw sandals.

**Dingwei Swift Attendant Li**
Offer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper, chicken, flags, flowers, dried venison, and straw sandals.

**Dingsi Swift Attendant Zhang**
Offer with wine, rice, food, fruit, paper candles, flags, incense, dried venison, and straw sandals.

Arrange the above on a clean mat, facing the Celestial Gate and with one’s back to the Earthly Door. The master stands with his back to the Celestial Gate, facing the *Xun* direction to proceed. Use yellow paper for the seven spirit tablets, inscribing them in black ink. The summoning flags and six spirit flags are to be inscribed in cinnabar on black silk, with the title: *“Swift Attendant of the [Current] Decan, Celestial Joy Venerable Spirit.”* Only Attendant Zhang’s tablet is not set; visualize him departing toward the *Xun* direction.

**Daily Merit Officer Talisman**
**Hourly Merit Officer Talisman**

**Summoning Incantation**
Summon the Year-Standing, Month-Standing, Day-Standing, and Hour-Standing Four Great Merit Officers. *□□□□□mā shè chà.* Above heaven, below heaven, the Eight Trigrams and yin-yang, the Merit Officers and talismanic envoys—divine majesty unfurls. Emerging from darkness, entering obscurity, traversing the Three Realms’ hidden regions, riding the talisman for swift summons, the response aligns with the Mysterious *Gang*. *Hasten, hasten, by the Emperor’s statutes and decrees!*

**Great Spirit’s Path-Opening Talisman**
*By the statutes and decrees of the Divine Numinous Jade-Pure True King of the Divine Empyrean—*

*Ǒm lī hōng. Ǒm lī hōng. Lī hōng ǒm. Ǒm lī ǒm. Ǒm lī hōng hōng.*

**Heavenly August Tactical-Servitude Talisman**
Inscribe the right talisman on yellow paper in cinnabar. The master first closes his eyes and sits in stillness, voiding inner and outer thoughts. With one stroke, the talisman is complete.

*The Pearl Left Behind by the Dharma Sea, Scroll Forty-One*
**Supreme Chaos-One-Qi Celestial Script**

Though thunder manifests in five forms, in truth it is one, and none departs from this body.
Thus, the world’s people store thunder within the heart, kidneys, and five viscera, yet this thunder alone dwells within the Chaos-One-Qi.
For elixir refinement must trace back to the Azure-Golden-Headed Imperial Master, the Primordial Yang Fu Li Ancestral Elder, called the Jade Crucible Fire-Refining Celestial Worthy’s Gallbladder and the Golden Tripod Decoction-Simmering Dao Ancestor’s Heart.
When the heart is at peace, one drives the River Chariot, circulates Heavenly Water, harmonizes with the Dao, and returns the light—able to revive the dead.
Refining it yields a radiant light that pierces the Dipper and Ox, its killing qi sharp as it courses through spirits and ghosts.
Yet the world remains unaware.
This thunder both gives life and kills, rewards and punishes; for praying for rain or sunshine, dispelling pestilence or curing illness, none is swifter.
Those who practice this method all restrain themselves with essence and qi, yet heaven and earth span countless thousands of miles—should guest qi intrude, would it not lead to grave error?
This method was received by Master Nan from the Sage, yet none knew it was personally transmitted by the Great One Savior from Suffering Celestial Worthy.
This method requires no stellar configurations, no qi, no hand seals—only single-minded devotion and steadfast practice, and none shall fail to receive a response.
The talismans are all celestial seal-script: five characters for praying for rain, five for summoning thunder, five for drawing lightning, five for commanding dragons; five for summoning the Nine Rivers’ envoys to govern waters, five for curing illness, five for aiding childbirth, five for subduing violent spirits, five for averting calamity, and one celestial seal-script character for extinguishing fire and dispelling pestilence, along with one talisman for refining wandering souls.
Thus, the Master of Salvation from Suffering states: When the heart is upright, qi is upright; when the heart is unified, qi is unified. With my uprightness, I correct what is not upright; with my unity, I unify what is not unified. Only in uprightness and unity does thunder become the thunder within this body—what fear is there that it will not come when summoned or fail to serve when commanded?
All who share this aspiration, heed these words well.

Respectfully inscribed by the Elder of Mount Qingcheng’s Cavern Mountain, Li Tieming of Western Shu.

Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

The Second Incantation:
With hair unbound, pacing the steps to seek the killing qi,
The sword’s tip ignites fire to refine the true script.
Lord Lao bestowed upon me the Chaos Method,
To command the Star Perfected and the Six-Six Thunder.
One qi, seven cycles—heaven and earth grow dark,
At the third watch and third point, summon the Thunder Deities.
Only the pivot of summoning thunder is known to few—
A profound and mysterious secret.
Cook poria in congee to refine the Star Perfected,
Always retain a single point to summon the Thunder Deities.
For one hour and eight quarters, fire follows the body,
The numinous talisman aligns with the orifices of the Heavenly Person.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Most High Dao Ancestor’s Military Statutes and Ordinances!

The Triple Summoning:
By the command of the Primordial Yang Emperor, swift as the Fire Star!
Should there be the slightest delay or disrespect, the Great Yang shall scorch and incinerate.
Reverently burn the true incense and proclaim the summons to the Primordial Qi of Chaos and the such-and-such Thunder Deity.
Let each and all who hear this present summons arrive with all haste!
Hasten, hasten, hasten!

The Essence of Heaven and Earth, the Essence of Yin and Yang.
The Qian revolves, the Kun turns—
The Pass summons the Star Perfected.
The eleven luminaries arrayed,
Born with the Emperor in the same breath.
Vast and boundless, Chaos,
The Primordial Qi first divided.
Heaven opened, Earth established,
Ghosts seized, spirits driven.
All things brought forth,
All beings nurtured.
By the Law of Chaos,
All gods heed in obedience.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes ordain!

**Decree and Incantation**
I act in the stead of the Most High Lord Lao,
Celestial Venerable of the Nine Heavens.
Thirty-two heavens form my crown,
Thirty-two heavens form my body.
I enact the Great Law of Chaos,
Commanding the sun, moon, and stars entire.
All sages heed my dispatch,
All perfected observe the altar’s gate.
Before mountains, rivers, and the Five Peaks arose,
There was the Primordial Elder Lord.
I bear the mandate of the First Ancestor,
To behead ghosts, slay demons, and extinguish spirits.
Should any defy my law,
Their heads and forms shall be severed, rootless.
For the realm, summon rain with haste;
For the people, seize ghosts with speed.
If any thunder deities disobey,
They shall be punished as yin soldiers of the Earth Prison.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes ordain!

**Another Incantation**

Celestial Venerable above the Nine Heavens.
Thirty-two heavens form my crown,
Thirty-two emperors form my body.
I enact the boundless Great Law,
To slay ghosts, punish demons, and shift the stars.
All sages heed my dispatch,
All perfected observe the altar’s gate.
Before mountains, rivers, and the Five Peaks arose,
There was the Venerable Lord of Primordial Chaos.
The Emperor decrees a blade ten thousand fathoms long,
Bestows upon me the ink seal to carry always.
By day, I descend to the human realm to relieve suffering;
By night, I dwell in the heavens to move the stars.
I summon the Perfected of Heaven and the Generals of Earth,
Manifesting divine power to descend in spirit.
Entrusted to me is the binding and beheading of evil ghosts,
To eradicate the karmic misdeeds of stars and obliterate forms.
A thousand miles become a single step,
A turn of the body brings fortune to the realm and salvation to the people.
The world is vast and at peace,
Ghosts are drawn into the gourd and slain.
I still my body and spread qi before and behind,
An immortal of Penglai’s Three Isles.
Swiftly, with wind and fire, I seize,
Cleaving demons and beheading ghosts to dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Most High Dao Ancestor’s Military Statutes and Ordinances!

The incantation complete, offer tea and wine, declare the intent, and dispatch with the decree.

Green waters, autumn waves, limpid and clear,
A thousand-catty iron axe rests lightly on the back.
By the riverside, willows sway in the wind,
Yet embracing Chang’e causes no alarm.

Red as the blood of the crimson ape.
The Weaver Girl’s Fourth Brother darkens the earth below,

The incantation spent, the numinous talisman summons the Nine Capitals.
Should one master the art of driving Heaven,
They may command the Nine Emperors of the Southern Bureau.
Clouds and dragons swirl, the Five Thunders decreed,
Feng Yi dances and chews the Nine Dragons.
Vast and resplendent, filling the Qian and Kun,
The sun and moon shift, mountains and peaks obey.
Lightning flashes, thunder crashes,
Shattering stones, springs, mountains, and seas.
Waters roar, dragons howl, flying stones shriek,
Mountains collapse, rocks split, the Earth God’s altar crumbles.

A single qi, sevenfold, darkens heaven and earth,
At the third watch, the third mark, summon the Thunder Deities.

Fivefold, sevenfold, a thousand *li* respond.
Subduing demon armies, restraining demon lords,
Winnowing winds, rain like a sieve, the Great Yin Star.

*The Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Forty-Two*

*The Supreme Petition for Exorcism and Secret Memorial: Ritual Procedures*

The *Daoist Methods Compendium*, Scroll 110, *Great Rites of the Mysterious Primordial Chaos Writ*, belongs to the same dharma lineage. Its *"Lineage and Origins of the Dharma School"* traces the transmission from the Iron Treasure Supreme Emperor and Iron Master Supreme Emperor, following the Iron Ascendant Supreme Emperor, to the Patriarchal Dharma-Holder, Propagator of the Teachings, and Founder of the Xuanjiao School, Iron Tablet Jade Creek Southern Perfected, named Wen Biao. The succession continued with Iron Inscription Dongshan Perfected Li Yingxin, Thunder Marshal Supreme Minister of the Unified Qi Perfected Iron Alms-Bowl Thunder Master Yulong Tiemuer, and Thunder Marshal Supreme Minister Iron Mountain Thunder Master Li Mingzheng. It also includes the *"Precepts of the Supreme Primordial Chaos Teachings"*, which elaborates on the principles, laws, and ordinances of the Primordial Chaos School, serving as a valuable reference.

**Ritual Procedures for Petition and Memorial**

The method states: First, observe the precepts, bathe, and change into ritual attire. Prepare the memorial by using the middle joint of your middle finger as a one-inch measure, making the document nine inches in height and width. Avoid empty words; ensure utmost sincerity in truthfully recording the matter at heart, with simplicity and solemnity as paramount.

On a quiet night, compose yourself in stillness and contemplation. Do not allow those who consume meat, outsiders, women, individuals in mourning attire, or cats and dogs to witness the ritual. This is called a *"secret memorial from the heart"*, and an auspicious day may be chosen. In urgent cases, no day need be selected—simply focus the mind, offer one stick of incense and a cup of water, and face the pivot of the Dipper with utmost sincerity, performing the rite as prescribed.

---

**Incantation for Changing Attire**
*Qian yuan heng li zhen.*
The Fusang tree emits its essence,
Five-colored clouds envelop the body.
Clothing covers the form,
In all movements and travels,
May the hun and po souls be at peace,
All evil subdued,
Eternally enjoying the blessed court.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

After reciting this incantation, the master silently intones the *"Purification of the Mouth"* incantation, makes the *zi* mudra, draws northern *qi*, and swallows it. Then, the *"Purification of the Body"* incantation is recited while making the *zi* mudra with both hands, drawing northern *qi* and blowing it to sweep both shoulders.

Next, intone the *"Purification of Heaven and Earth Qi"* and the *"Slaying Mudra"*, drawing northern *qi*.

---

**Incantation for Dispelling Impurities**
The Nine Phoenix Perfected,
Phoenixes that break impurities,
Clad in vermilion, wielding swords,
Stand above me.
Nine heads spew fire,
Advancing before me.
Flaming, engulfing the earth,
Ten zhang of firelight.
The Nine Phoenixes break impurities,
Evil spirits perish.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Supreme Emperor!*

Make the *wu* mudra and draw southern *qi*.

---

**Nine Phoenixs’ Vajra**
With the right foot stepping and the hand sweeping, the master visualizes the Nine Phoenix Perfected, clad in vermilion ritual robes, wielding fire swords, riding nine-headed vermilion phoenixes, descending from the south to cover the practitioner’s form. Each of the Nine Phoenixes spews fierce fire, burning away impure *qi* until all is purified.

Next, silently recite the secret incantation:
*He ming tian di ri.*

Recite this incantation in one breath, nine times, make the *wu* mudra, draw southern *qi*, and focus the mind so that the ritual space is illuminated as if under the sun. Then, step through the hexagrams.

*Winter Solstice*
*Summer Solstice*

**Subtle Sound Incantation**
Seven Ghosts, Seven Stars—essences of all numinous spirits.
The Two Attendants, the Two Assistants—luminous emblems of the Three Terraces.
The Six Ding Jade Maidens, the Four Generals of the Purple Tenuity.
The Celestial Vanguard, the Celestial Origin—Kan Water and the Human Origin.
The Four-Eyed Divine Immortals, the Golden Youths who transmit words.
Recite this one hundred times, and the Seven Perfected will manifest.
Prolong life, dispel misfortune, restrain poison, extinguish demons.
Pray as you will, and preserve true prosperity.
The body radiates light, and Qian’s primal power flows smoothly.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!

Upon completing the incantation, the master makes the Dipper Seal, recites the preceding incantation once—or forty-nine times—while the left hand forms the mudras of Greed, Greatness, Emolument, Health, Military, and Destruction, and the right hand forms [the corresponding seals]. Next, visualize the Seven Stars descending and appearing distinctly.

**Secret Incantation**
Intestine Bright, Yin Essence, One Perfected, Mysterious Darkness.
Cinnabar Origin, Northern Gate—numinous power of the Celestial Pass.
Remove this servant’s name from the register of death, inscribe this servant’s name in the record of long life.
All requests are fulfilled, all wishes are accomplished.
All people hold one in esteem, and one ascends to the Purple Court.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!

This method is used to enter the Dipper for audience and petition. The master visualizes the Four Upright Merit Officers leading the way, two Jade Maidens bearing banners crossing the bridge, and two messengers riding clouds to enter.

The master visualizes the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars distinctly, each patrolling three to five hundred *li*, the Dipper’s light shining below, blazing as if under the sun. Next, click the teeth, offer incense, clasp the Dipper Seal, and recite the secret incantation:

Incense burns with sincerity, the will gazes upon celestial perfection.
The Dipper’s gates open, illuminating principle and clarity.
The Seven Origins, the Three Terraces, the Northern Culmen Sovereign.
The Three Luminaries, the Nine Radiant Ones, the divine soldiers of ten thousand *li*.
Celestial generals receive the talisman’s command—my orders are swiftly executed.
The Dharma’s commands are wisdom, the Dao’s path connects to the real.
The Dharma harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, the Dharma protects my body.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances of the Northern Dipper and the Supreme Mystery!

With both hands forming the *wu* mudra, silently recite the *Purify Heaven and Earth Incantation*. When the flames blaze, burn the petition in the abundant incense fire, close the eyes, and visualize while reciting the secret incantation nine times:

The heart’s spirit and cinnabar origin enable my communion with the real.
Contemplate the spirit, refine the fluid—true darkness abides forever.
I now submit my petition, may it swiftly reach the Stellar Palace.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

*Oṃ ma da li.*
*Yaṃ cha li.*

*Ha-□-li.*

Upon reciting the above incantation thrice, hold the breath and concentrate the spirit, gazing downward into the heart. Circulate the heart’s crimson *qi*, then raise the eyes and exhale it upward. Visualize the crimson *qi* ascending to the crown of the head, where it meets the azure *qi*, transforming into a rainbow bridge spanning the mid-heavens and entering directly into the Dipper’s mouth.

Then visualize within the *qi* a perfected person, clad in a scarlet immortal’s robe and crowned with the *Jin Xian* coronet, riding the crimson *qi* and bearing the burnt petition in both hands, ascending straight through the rainbow bridge into the Dipper’s mouth.

Proclaim: *"Disciple [Name] now presents a matter of the heart for your attention."*

Next, visualize two figures within the Dipper, resembling jade maidens in form, dressed in official green immortal robes adorned with white fish carriages. One holds a ram’s head in the left hand and a sword in the right—this is the *Striker of the Ram* Messenger. The other supports a golden tray in the left hand, upon which rests a peony, while holding a peony branch in the right—this is the *Dhāraṇī* Messenger.

From the Dipper emerge clouds of five auspicious colors. Present the petition’s contents to them, and one of the messengers will convey it upward to the Dipper star governing the appropriate palace. Should any words be misstated or flawed, humbly beseech correction and proper presentation, lest the celestial officials impose reprimand. Earnestly hope for the petition’s acceptance to fulfill the heart’s intent, and swiftly grant a response.

Upon speaking, visualize the heart’s spirit clearly entrusting the petition to one of the messengers. See the two messengers solemnly present it and enter the Dipper.

Then recite the secret incantation:

The Mysterious Supreme Yin—eight windows open bright.
All petitions presented, the jade maidens convey the numinous.
Every seeking is fulfilled, every wish is accomplished.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally perfected.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

Heart-spirit, heart-spirit, unite with the Dao in truth.
The petition ascends, then returns to its origin.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

*Oṃ. □-jik-ra-ti-cha-□-ming-shep.*

One Qi, Three Traversals

Upon completing the incantation, trace from the *zi* character to the *hai* character on the cyclical wheel, entering the middle joint of the middle finger, then gather and stabilize. Visualize green qi ascending from the Mud Pill Palace, then imagine red qi being drawn in through the nose. Next, rotate the head once in a full circle, inhale qi once more, and swallow it. Envision the spirit riding the qi as it enters through the nose, returning to its proper place, then stand ready to await the response.

**Writing the Heart Petition and Conducting the Ritual**

When writing a heart petition, first compose the spirit and settle the thoughts. Then perform the Nine Phoenix Rite, recite the invocation to the Radiant Heavenly Emperor, and follow with the secret incantation to consecrate the paper, brush, and ink. Do not utter a sound while writing the petition.

**Incantation:**

Great Radiance of Heaven and Earth,
Myriad qi intermingle and arise.
I attain the True One,
Within the Jade Court of Inner Vision.
The August Emperor of Emptiness commands,
Bidding me to commune with the perfected.
Upper Prime Red Child,
Three Primes and Six Palaces—
All spirits assemble,
Merging with my body.
Ascending to the Dipper’s palace,
Entering and exiting the Purple Court.
Roaming and feasting in the Eight Darknesses,
The Three Ones ascend to the Upper Radiance.
Grand Unity, Mysterious Perfected,
Convey my intent,
Transmit it to the Dipper’s perfected.
Whatever the heart desires,
Silently present and receive assent.
The received Mysterious Decree
Accords with my heart’s spirit.
All worldly affairs,
Each and every one, are resolved.
The spirit soars to the Jade Altar,
The body divides into one form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!

Upon completing the incantation, draw in northern qi and blow it forth. Then visualize the Jade Stars standing in the five directions, with the sun and moon to the left and right.

I reverently beseech the Dao’s compassion to absolve all my transgressions of irreverence and offense, and to grant special mercy, permitting the fulfillment of my petition. I earnestly implore the bestowal of grace and command, that it may accord with my heart’s desire.

For my presumption in troubling your august majesty, your servant’s feelings are overwhelmed with urgency and longing. I prostrate myself in anticipation of the Dao’s decree.

[Year] [Month] [Day]
[Rank and Name], Your humble servant [Full Name], respectfully submits this petition.

Seal the petition with the governance seal; do not use an outer envelope or wrapping.

First, with the left hand, perform the Nine Phoenix Rite, blow while reciting the invocation to the Radiant Heavenly Emperor, and visualize the act of consecration.

Next, with the left hand, press the *xu* and *hai* positions to form the Opening the Heavenly Gate mudra.

Then press the *kun* and *xun* characters, anointing the left and right eyes to form the Preserving the Human Gate.

Next, press the upper joints of the four fingers, visualizing the Golden Lad of Incense Offering and the Jade Maiden of Message Transmission.

Then press the upper, middle, and lower joints of the middle finger to form the Three Heavens mudra, and flick upward to open the Three Heavenly Gates.

**Incense for Petitioning the Dipper**

Cogon grass, fennel seeds, cloud incense, pine seeds, cypress seeds.

These incenses are local products, the tokens of the earth. Though aloeswood, sandalwood, benzoin, and frankincense may be exquisite, they are but the qi of foreign cliffs and crags—ill-suited for addressing the true. The finest is still *jiangzhen* incense.

**Matters Governed by the Dipper’s True Ones**

All methods of petitioning the Dipper depend on the practitioner’s application. Generally, those who fail to receive a response do so because they do not know which governing star presides over their affair. Just as human kings and ministers have officials assigned to specific duties, so too must one not petition indiscriminately. The celestial real ones, after all, have their own bureaus and offices. To draft a memorial, first determine the nature of the matter, then identify which star governs it, and petition accordingly—assurance of a response will follow.

**First Heaven:** The Celestial Commandant, the Star Lord of Greed-Wolf, and his consort, the Inner Consort, oversee the redress of wrongs, the vindication of right, the suppression of others’ evil, the advancement of one’s own virtue, the remission of sins, and the prayer for blessings. They hold office during the *Shi* and *Bi* mansions, and the *Kui* and *Lou* constellations.

**Second Heaven:** The Grand Steward, the Star Lord of Great Gate, and his consort, the Inner Concubine, govern the arts of yin and yang, official advancement, and the pursuit of schemes. They hold office during the *Wei*, *Mao*, *Bi*, and *Zi* mansions.

**Third Heaven:** The Minister of Works, the Star Lord of Prosperity-Keeper, and his consort, the Primordial Mother, oversee the study of the Dao, the quest for immortality, and communion with the true and attainment of the sagely. They hold office during the *Shen*, *Jing*, *Gui*, and *Liu* mansions.

**Fourth Heaven:** The Patrol General, the Star Lord of Literary Brilliance, and his consort, the Inner Consort, govern the subjugation of human and spectral foes and the execution of malevolent forces. They hold office during the *Xing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, and *Zhen* mansions.

**Fifth Heaven:** The Dipper Lord, the Star Lord of Integrity-Chastity, and his consort, the Eldest Daughter, oversee the augmentation of lifespan, the establishment of merit, and the prayer for blessings. They hold office during the *Jiao*, *Kang*, *Di*, and *Fang* mansions.

**Sixth Heaven:** The Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Star Lord of Martial Brilliance, and his consort, the Middle Daughter, govern the alleviation of calamities, obstructions, illnesses, and misfortunes, and the prayer for relief and exemption. They hold office during the *Xin*, *Wei*, *Ji*, and *Dou* mansions.

**Seventh Heaven:** The Supreme Emperor, the Star Lord of Rupture-Soldier, and his consort, the Youngest Daughter, oversee the resolution of cosmic blockages and the regulation of qi and seasonal cycles. They hold office during the *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, and *Wei* mansions.

**Eighth Heaven:** The Venerable Jade Emperor’s Outer Assistant, the Star Lord, and his consort oversee the exorcism of manifold disasters and the prolongation of life through medicinal practice. They hold office on the day of one’s original destiny and natal hour.

**Ninth Heaven:** The Perfected of the Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Inner Counselor, the Star Lord, and his consort oversee prayers for the people’s blessings and the salvation of all matters. They hold office on the day of one’s original destiny and natal hour.

**The Heavenly Stem Method**

Each month, regularly add *xu*; at every hour, behold the Star Lord of Rupture-Soldier. If the monthly general has not yet passed, then proceed in sequence through the original palace.

For example: at the *hai* hour in the first month, wishing to locate the Celestial Stem, the first month’s Celestial Stem at the *xu* hour resides in *yin*. The celestial Way revolves leftward, and the *hai* hour is precisely at the *xu* position.

It is also said: the general of the first month is at *hai*; the celestial Way revolves leftward, and the general of the second month is at *xu*.

For example: at the *zi* hour in the first month, wishing to know the location of the Celestial Stem’s palace, take the first month’s general at the *hai* hour and superimpose it upon *zi*, then proceed rightward to encounter *chen*—this is the palace of the Celestial Stem.

At the *zi* hour in the first month, *hai* is added to *zi* and counted off; *chen* falls upon *si*, so at that hour the Celestial Stem is precisely at *si*.

In the rightward method, visualize a firelight as fine as a thread descending obliquely; inhale through the nostrils to gather the center, then look upward—this is the *qi* of the Celestial Stem.

**Auspicious Days for Petitioning the Northern Dipper’s Procession**
For petitions to the Dipper, observe the third and seventh auspicious days of each month, *gengshen* and *jiazi*, the Three Origins and Five La days, followed by the days governed by the lunar mansions, and further by the establishment days of each month.

On vermilion paper, write in cinnabar ink a talisman seven *cun* in height and seven *cun* in length. Leave three characters blank at the top, one character blank at the bottom, three lines blank at the front, and four lines blank at the back to form the grid. On the outer envelope, write:

Now, in accordance with the stated intent and the received petition, we dare not suppress or obstruct. Respectfully prepared is one copy of the Dipper’s Numinous Chapter, to be conveyed to the True Dipper, requiring transmission. We hereby memorialize and urgently request that the wind-borne courier bear and present the Numinous Chapter, proceeding directly to the steps of the Mysterious Pivot, to convey the circumstances and submit the petition on our behalf, humbly beseeching the sagely Dipper Sovereign to incline its radiance downward and bestow its gracious power.

We implore that for [Name], the sins and transgressions within their person be pardoned, the baleful stellar influences be harmonized and warded off, peace and well-being be secured, illnesses be pacified, and prayers be answered through spiritual resonance. We await the manifest response and earnestly hope for swift tidings.

*Respectfully memorialized.*

On the ___ day of the ___ month, at the ___ hour, this memorial is respectfully submitted.

*Om. Om. Om. By imperial decree. Hum. Hum. Southern Spirit of Ma. Zha. Hum. Hum. Li. Hasten to execute with urgency.*

Written in cinnabar script, arranged in four lines.

*[Rank] [Name] [Seal]*

The Patriarchal Perfected Sovereign of the Three Heavens, Upholder of the Dao, Orthodox Unity, Serene Response, Manifest Aid, and True Lord, summons and deploys the divine agents for service.

We reverently summon the Dipper’s Mouth Memorial-Conveying Merit Official:
*Om. Gaya. Tāra. Hum. Li. Zha. Ma.*

Let the Great Divine Messenger swiftly arrive.
*Gaya. Hum. Om. By decree. Fire [seal] Zha. Om. Da. Zha. Hum. Hum. Svāhā.*

By this method, visualize the messenger arriving before you from the Dipper’s Mouth, riding golden light, wearing a black cap with a celestial-facing topknot and black robes, bearing a document casket. Upon completing the invocation, hold the chapter with the Dipper Mudrā, visualizing the characters within transforming into golden radiance.

Next, recite the memorial and burn the chapter in the incense burner with abundant fragrant flames. Then, invoke the messenger, state the purpose, and dispatch them by decree. With both hands, perform the Yin-Yang Dipper gesture to sever the connection, sprinkle water, and visualize the messenger ascending to the Dipper Palace upon golden light.

Then recite the Northern Dipper Salvation-from-Suffering Divine Incantation:
*Hum. Om. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Da. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Mo. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. [Seal] Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Na. Ma. Da. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. By decree. Da. Li. By decree. Zha. Svāhā. Hum. Zha. By decree. Divine Benefit. Svāhā.*

Upon completing the incantation, visualize the incense smoke ascending directly to the Dipper’s Mouth, reaching the True Dipper.

Next, perform the *Tiger-Crossing-Horse Dipper* ritual: position the Dipper’s Mouth above the head, with the Dipper’s Handle pointing directly toward the Dipper’s Mouth. Visualize the petitioner’s spirit riding golden light to the Handle Star, crossing the Immortal Bridge, and arriving at the Dipper Palace. Silently state the petition, then recite the True Words:
*Kudi. Di. She. Su. Zha. Aruo. Mi. Zha. Wu. Du. Zha. Kuqi. Zha. Polai. Di. Zha. Yewei. Ruo. Zha. Wu. Du. Zha. Kuluo. Di. Zha. Qimo. Zha. Svāhā.*

Conclude with the esoteric instructions for seated meditation and union with the spirit.

The petitioner gathers spirit, curls the soles of both feet inward, clasps hands in the *Thunder Crouch* mudrā, and interlocks them at the waist, closing the breath until full. Visualize the *qi* from the *Yongquan* acupoints surging upward to the *Heart Palace*, where crimson *qi* spirals and revolves. Next, with both eyes fixed upon the petitioner’s *Yintang* point, suddenly perceive an aperture opening there. Visualize the heart’s fire blazing like a flue, shooting straight through the *Yintang* point and ascending to meet the Dipper’s Mouth. From the flames, a Jade Maiden slowly emerges, her form taking shape like luminous essence. She faces the petitioner directly. Silently recite the *Great Merit Incantation* seven times, then imagine the Jade Maiden returning speech to you—thus is the connection established.

Practice this union at the noon hour for three days. Thereafter, perform it at will, with the hours of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* all being efficacious. When practicing this method, three forms of response may manifest: *written response*, *dream response*, or *ash-altar response*.

For a *written response*, first purify the body and recite the esoteric incantation in the heart. Then invoke the *Yellow Emperor of the Central Palace, Controller of Destiny and Hearth Lord*. Next, summon the *Jade Immortal Bright Essence Youth* from beneath the throne. Silently recite the *Numinous Yang Swift Response Great Merit Incantation*, form the *Li* trigram mudrā, and draw the central yellow *qi*. Blow it toward the hearth in the direction of the ritual’s intent. Take a sheet of paper and inscribe the matter at hand, the officiant affixing their seal and rolling it up. Place a brush inside, sealing it together. In a short while, the response will arrive.

When first practicing, use the fifth *xu* day, offering a rice meal as sacrifice. Pray for transmission of the *Orthodox Mind Esoteric Canon* to a designated recipient on a specified date. For all petitions, swift responses are hoped for. Should one betray this trust, a memorial shall be submitted to the *Dipper Palace*, the *True Lord of Upholding Sageliness and Protecting Virtue*, the *Yellow Emperor of the Central Palace, Controller of Destiny and Hearth Lord*, the *Jade Immortal of the Sudden Ascent*, the *Bright Essence Youth*, and the *Venerable Alchemical Maiden*—may they clearly dispatch reproof, not through any malice of mine. If I am not sincere, may they impose punishment, and I shall harbor no resentment.

From this day forth, this decree is made known to all. Let it be openly declared and dutifully observed.

**Incantation for Purifying Body and Mind**
*Qingyang, Qingyang, belonging to the left direction.
Above dwells true essence, below coalesces numinous light.
The Dao naturally secures the true; water wondrously merges with golden light.
Pouring into body and mind, the dharmic visualization is fulfilled.
I now recite and unfold, harmonizing with the Dao’s resonance.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Yellow Emperor’s decree of the Central Palace.*

**Numinous Yang Swift Response Six Merit Incantation**
*Om. Hum. Zha. Śakra. Mīra. Mīra. Swift response, swift response.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the True Lord of Upholding Sageliness.*

For this incantation, form the *Li* trigram mudrā and draw the central yellow *qi*. Visualize the True Lord emerging from the Dipper Palace, appearing amidst the clouds, holding a *wish-fulfilling wheel* and commanding *Bright Essence* with hands clasped in obedience. Then imagine a stream of yellow *qi* from your own spleen meridian rising upward, merging with the cloud *qi* of the southeast. Visualize yourself transforming into a youth riding a tiger, ascending with the *qi*, uniting with the cloud-borne youth to become one. Draw this in through the mouth, then blow it onto the talisman. Burn the talisman, then place the paper and brush upon the hearth. The hearth must be kept pure, and women’s impurity, peering, or idle chatter are to be avoided. Wait two hours before retrieving the paper. If nothing is written, burn another talisman and recite the *Urgent Summons Incantation*:

*Between heaven and earth, departure and abiding are not fixed.
For all who make supplication, swiftly descend the cinnabar ladder.
Brush, ink, paper, and silk—grant the numinous response early.
As wished, as sensed, neither transgress nor disobey.
By imperial decree, the numinous youth swiftly descends.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the True Lord of Upholding Sageliness.*

**Esoteric Incantation**
*Tí bǔ lún □ shè.*

Recite this incantation once with a single breath, three times in total. After each *written response* ritual, burn three hundred gold coins and one *cloud horse* as offerings. For subsequent earnest requests, proceed in the same manner.

**Esoteric Talisman**
*Emperor Flame, Emperor Flame, Firelight’s Foremost.*

**Flight through the Nine Heavens, Enveloped in Crimson Radiance**
*Hurl fire across ten thousand leagues, spreading boundless through heaven and earth.
Reverently obey the decrees of the Fire Emperor of the South.*

Recite the preceding esoteric incantation once with a single breath, three times in total.

**Dream-Attaching Method**
For this method to convey messages in dreams, cut a child-figure from yellow paper, inscribe the talisman on its reverse, and further write: *"Summon Bright Hero to descend swiftly. Reverently obey the decrees of the Fire Emperor of the South."*

**Dream-Attaching Secret Method**
When desiring to receive responses in dreams—whether to meet someone the following day or to seek answers regarding personal matters—one must prepare in advance by performing the incantation and visualization as previously instructed. Then, augment the ritual with the *Orthodox Invocation Esoteric Incantation*. Afterward, burn the petition silently, using a sheet of yellow paper approximately seven inches in width and length. Write in vermilion ink the details of the supplication in fine script, concluding with: *"On such-and-such a night of this month, at such-and-such an hour, humbly beseech a clear response in dreams."*

**Orthodox Invocation Esoteric Incantation** *(also called the Celestial Youth Incantation)*
*Celestial Youth, Celestial Youth, stationed in the Central Palace.
The Maiden Spirit Lord, illuminated by imperial decree.
Transforming her form, she rides a tiger, commanding fire dragons to descend.
Holding a precious fan, her steps are dignified and poised.
For those who make earnest requests, no wish is denied.
In urgent matters, all is revealed within dreams.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decrees of the Yellow Emperor.*

**Ash-Altar Manifestation Method for Responses**
At the hour of *rending* (9–11 p.m.), use fine ash or lime to sweep clean the area before the hearth. First, arrange a Northern Dipper formation with ash, placing it inverted like the Dipper’s shape at the hearth. Then, take approximately one or two *sheng* of ash and form a circular altar beneath the Dipper. Smooth it with a chicken feather. Proceed to an open space, face the Northern Dipper, and invoke each stellar position in turn. Summon the *Upholding Sageliness* deity, then close your eyes and visualize the True Lord of the Northern Dipper descending, with the *Upholding Sageliness* from the Dipper’s Palace arriving together. Lead them back to the hearth, inviting each to sit upon the corresponding Dipper position previously arranged. Perform seven prostrations in the heart, summon *Bright Hero*, and recite the *Great Achievement Incantation* as before. Visualize *Bright Hero* descending, following the established procedure.

**Manifesting Ash Traces to Reveal Secret Portents**
Make earnest supplications as desired and await the response.

**The Great Rite of Destiny Petition and Disaster Aversion**
**Celestial Petition to the Dipper**

This method originated in Western Shu and is not commonly known in the world. Later, the Nine Radiant Immortals of the Zhangren Abbey in Chengdu transmitted it to the Xianzhen Abbey on Shaoshi Mountain in Jiangxi, where it spread among the people. Master passed it to disciple by oral transmission, a method for urgent petitions to the Dipper, unknown to the secular world.

The master said: The sins and blessings of humanity are all reported to the celestial authorities. In Heaven, they are governed by the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, who oversee human destiny. In the world, this office is held by the Hearth Lord. Moreover, the Lord of Destiny is the chief of the Six Spirits and the manifested agent of the Seven Primes within the Dipper. This deity records the actions of humanity, whether upright or deceitful, and on the last day of each month, ascends to Heaven to submit a complete report. Major transgressions result in the loss of life or the severing of one’s lineage, while minor offenses bring misfortune upon the self. How could one escape?

In recent times, wealthy households and noble officials, when encountering inauspicious years and suffering calamities, have sought Daoist masters and shamans to perform rites of petition and aversion. Some offer prayers to the stars, others hold grand jiao rituals, expending wealth to purchase offerings and mobilizing servants for preparations. Yet they exert no personal effort, merely providing their presence to bear witness. Among them, some fail to abstain from meat, act carelessly, or even laugh irreverently. How can they expect their prayers to be answered?

The masters of old were cultivated persons of high virtue, simple and sincere, yet their methods were inflexible. Thus, the grace of the Most High—who opens the path to deliverance and aids the living—could not be widely extended or equally bestowed, failing to universally benefit all beings. In this way, the advantage lay with the rich, not the poor. By worldly standards, those of modest means, when struck by disaster, lack the vast resources to perform such rites and can only await death helplessly—how pitiful!

The Most High cherishes all life and values contentment, whether noble or base, high or low. Yet the *Mysterious Numinous* scripture states: For the poor and lowly, who lack the means to perform grand rituals, even offering a cup of water or a single flower is dismissed as empty pretense. This is due to the world’s mediocre masters and vulgar practitioners, who refuse to humble themselves, seek teachers, or inquire into the Dao. They concern themselves only with attire, voice, and ornate implements, creating an illusion of beauty. Their practices are mere plagiarism and fabrication, deceiving later students.

In recent times, the *Mysterious Numinous* method of silent petition and the secret rites of the *River Chart* have circulated. Some obtain a few talismanic commands from its texts or memorize a few lines of esoteric incantations, yet they understand nothing of their depth. They deceive households and delude the celestial perfected, performing nothing more than lighting lamps, burning paper, and reciting dedications. The master said: If the Lord of Destiny can report humanity’s sins and blessings to Heaven, then I shall entrust this secret method to him, conveying these sentiments to the stellar heavens and petitioning on their behalf to avert disasters. The response shall be swift as shooting stars.

In my travels among the masters, I encountered a person of high attainment who transmitted to me the *Elbow-Pocket Petition to the Dipper* and other oral secrets. I have since devoted myself to its practice and repeatedly witnessed its numinous efficacy. The cost is minimal, yet its responses are timely. Regardless of gender, those facing peril should first observe three days of purification and abstinence, then perform the method with focused intention. There is no instance where the deities do not respond. The key lies in sincerity—do not harbor disrespect or act recklessly. To violate the celestial statutes is no small matter; Heaven will surely know, and disaster will follow swiftly, leaving no room for prayer.

Now, in strict accordance with my master’s transmission, I set forth these instructions. For all scholars who approach this with reverence, single-minded devotion, and respectful observance, acting as Heaven’s proxy to transform and save beings, the merit is vast and beyond description. Take heed and do not neglect this.

**Sequence of Practice**
For all practices, one must first purify body and mind through abstinence and bathing, dispelling all distracting thoughts. Each morning, burn incense, face north, sit in silent meditation for a short while, and recite the scriptures with utmost sincerity before inscribing the talismans.

**Altar-Transforming Talisman**
This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper, seven inches in length and three inches in width. Hold the paper in the left hand while forming the *sha* mudra, draw in the northern *qi*, and write "Chen Renyong enters the talisman." Visualize the Five Numinous Officials of the Dipper’s mouth descending, and seal it with the Golden Edict character.

**Talisman-Inscribing Incantation**
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper,
Great deities of the celestial center.
Above, they attend the Golden Palace;
Below, they cover Mount Kunlun.
They regulate the cosmic order,
Governing Heaven and Earth.
Great Kui, Greedy Wolf,
Giant Gate, Wealth Repository,
Literary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity,
Martial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.
They encompass the great celestial realm,
Penetrating even the finest dust.
What disaster cannot be eradicated?
What blessing cannot be attained?
The primordial *qi* of the August Sovereign
Comes to merge with my body.
Wherever the Celestial Pivot points,
It revolves day and night without cease.
Though I am a humble person,
I seek the Dao and yearn for the numinous.
May I always behold your august presence
And wish to preserve long life.
The Highest Jade Thearch,
The Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord.
Hasten, as the law commands!

**Purification Talisman**
This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper. First recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation*, then draw in the northern *qi* to infuse the talisman.

**Incantation of the Great Dipper Deities**
The Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,
Whose *qi* governs the heavens.
The Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot,
Whose majestic radiance is boundless.
Above Heaven and below Earth,
They sever the roots of all evil.

Ascend upon the clouds to descend before the altar.
Descending with true *qi*, piercing water and entering mist.
Transmitted through the Three Realms,
All demons bow in submission.
Severing demons and erasing traces,
Turning death into ascension to immortality.
Hasten, as the law commands!

**Inscribing the Dipper**
For each star, visualize the Celestial Star Palace descending a thread of true *qi*. The master inhales it through the nose and gently exhales it into the star of the Dipper. Then, inscribe the Dipper’s taboo name upon the crane’s back, recite the Sanskrit incantation to anoint it, and draw in the *qi* of each star.

**Sanskrit Incantation of the Dipper’s Great Deities**
*Ju zhi di she su cha a ruo mi cha wu du cha ju qi cha bo lai di cha ye wei ruo cha wu du cha ju luo di cha qi mo cha sa ha.*

**Talisman for Deliverance from Calamity**
Visualize the afflicted person standing before the altar. Next, visualize a golden elixir descending from the Dipper and entering the sufferer’s body. Then inscribe the talisman, adding a command character and the afflicted person’s name to anoint it. Cover it with the Dipper, facing upward toward the Dipper’s palace, the Bureau of Exorcising Disasters and Delivering from Calamity, to substitute for the sufferer’s bodily misfortunes.

Next recite:
The numinous nodes flourish,
Wishing to preserve long life.
The Supreme Mystery’s One,
Guarding and protecting the body’s form.
The spirit lords of the Five Viscera,
Each safeguarding peace.
Hasten, as the law commands!

**Incantation**
The Supreme Numinosity of the Nine Palaces,
The Great One guards the chamber.
A hundred spirits stand in solemn defense,
Soul and spirit harmonized as one.
Long life and enduring vision,
Sealing and extinguishing evil and misfortune.
One yin and one yang,
Forever preserving auspicious prosperity.
Hasten, as the law commands!

Other auspicious or inauspicious signs are to be interpreted with discernment.
Stove purification and written petitions follow standard forms.

**Procedure for Ritual Practice**
First, have someone sweep and clean the stove area. Then proceed according to the prescribed method. Place a lamp inside the wok and cover it with a rice sieve, ensuring no layperson or woman sees it.

**Great Rites of the Supreme Mystery for the Ghost-Gate Marshal #1**

**Marshal Guan of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Demon-Subduing Judiciary**
The Great Ghost-Gate Marshal of the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu, Slayer of Demons and Executioner of Judgment, bears the taboo name *Yu* and the style *Yunchang*. His face is like a crimson jujube, his aspect fierce and valiant. He rides a red steed, wears a *Dongling* cap, a turquoise headscarf, and black boots.

**Summoning Incantation**
By decree of the Northern Emperor, Marshal Guan is summoned—governing earth, commanding heaven, beheading demons, and slaying ghosts, his might shaking the demon kings.
At the first call of this command, swiftly emerge from the hidden pass and descend with haste.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Northern Yin Fengdu Emperor!*
**Oṃ.**
*Zhe-chou zhuo-kun ji-mao pan-si zhong-□ zi li-dui ru-gen*
*Lan-li shen-she.*

**Oṃ.** *Pī-lì jīn-guāng-□ sù xiàn.*
**Oṃ.** *Hūṃ hūṃ cha-bō.*
Great Marshal Guan, swiftly descend to execute fierce judgment and seize!
Visualize black *qi* behind the elbow, draw it into the kidney palace, and after a long moment, exhale behind the right elbow. Envision the Marshal within the Northern Dipper, manifesting his form before you.
*Fei-fei huāng-huāng*, Marshal Guan is fierce and mighty, wielding a golden blade to sever misfortune and calamity.
*Lǎng-líng Jūn*, *Lǎng-líng Jūn*, Great Marshal Guan, swiftly manifest your true form!
**Oṃ jīn-cha**, **Oṃ jīn-cha**, *jié-cha* descend and seize!

**Great Oath Incantation**
*Lǎng-líng, Lǎng-líng*, Demon-Subduing General.
Fengdu’s solemn execution, black *qi* congeals in haste.
White-robed, iron-steed, red-browed, turquoise-scarved.
Seizing souls for interrogation, binding spirits to bodies.
Driving out demons, restraining ghosts, sparing none, near or far.
When the task is done, the mountain general’s command belongs to the netherworld.
The Nine Springs resound with orders, *qi* of slaughter swirling thick.
Mournful winds howl, a million-strong army.
At this summons, swiftly manifest your golden body!
*Swiftly, as decreed by the statutes of the Purple Tenuity Emperor!*
**Decree-summoning:** **Oṃ-□ hǒu-tū lún-tuō-bō**, Great Marshal, swiftly manifest your true form!
*Hasten!*
**Dissolution of Form**

The True Essence of Water and the Heroic Soul of Fire,
Guan Yu of the Northern Capital—mighty and fierce.
Fifty million soldiers, banners arrayed in ranks,
Swiftly descend in majesty to sever and purge demonic thieves.
Pursue souls, seize spirits, chase across the Eight Directions,
As the Four Seas darken in gloom.
Sharp blades reverse into swords, annihilating perverse *qi* and evil.
By the Northern Emperor’s decree, Fengdu’s commands resound,
Shaking heaven and earth, retribution made clear.

**Demon-Severing Decree**
*Inscribed upon the Six Palaces’ secret talisman:*
*Zhou Jue, Biao Di Chen, Liang’s affairs weigh heavy upon Ah.*
*Flaming as smoke in the firmament, surging like radiant splendor.*
*The martial deity girds the divine blade, serene yet swallowing the Clear River.*
*Changhe looms over the Crimson Well, the Spirit Gate towering, jagged.*
*The Seven Wrongs traverse the wondrous canopy, linked and spreading demonic sway.*
*The Six Heavens bar the northern path—this is the abode of ghosts and gods.*
*Heavenly thunder, lightning’s flash—seize!*

**Zi-Wu Dipper**
*Oṃ, Tiānjī Dìnī, swiftly seize!*
**Zi-Wu Dipper**
*Oṃ hūm hūm □-cha, seize!*
**Yin-Wu Dipper**, both enter the talisman.

**Lǎng-líng Talisman**
Names of the Northern Dipper, Southern Dipper,
Twenty-Eight Constellations, Three Elixir Fields—thunder and fire enter the two registers,
Striking with resounding force.
Shaking heaven and earth, retribution made clear.
The Eight *Sha* names enter: from *Hài* to *Xùn*, *Kūn* to *Gèn*—the Dipper turns, the *Kuí-Gāng* aligns.
*Hasten, as decreed by the Northern Emperor’s Great Mysterious Demon-Quelling Statutes!*

Silently invoke the Thirteen Golds, ascend to the Celestial Court,
Visualize the seal upon the glabella—black golden light shoots forth,
The brush becomes the *sha*-ghost brush, then applied.
At the first stir of thunder’s might, awe strikes all,
*Hēng hōng huá là*—salvation, reverence, seizure!
**Zi-Wu Dipper, Yin-Wu Dipper**, the two registers intertwine,
Rub the kidneys, circulate water and fire to form thunder,
The mouth sounds in unison—strike once, inhale, draw into the talisman.
Wind, thunder, lightning, fire rage forth in fury.

**Fengdu’s Nine Springs Command Talisman**
Heaven’s Dao, Earth’s Dao, Humanity’s Dao,
Great Yin, Great Yang, Five Planets, Twenty-Eight Constellations, all stars,
Three *Qi* Heavenly Lords, Eight *Sha* Generals,
Marshal Tiānyóu executes the rotating *sha*.

**Plague-Curing Formula**
My body’s three hundred sixty bones become five thunder fire chariots,
Encircling and enclosing.
Instantly emit the true fire incantation:
At *wǔ*, my ancestors stand before me,
At *wǔ*, my root master behind,
At *zǐ*, my scripture master to the left,
At *mǎo*, my register master to the right,
At *yǒu*, my ordination master at the center.
The jade script grasps the temple’s self,
At *yǒu*, the heavens overturn,
At *chén*, the earth upends.
At *xū*, throttle the plague’s throat,
Seal the plague’s nose, block the plague’s ears.
Solemnly invoke General Copper Nail to nail shut the ears of all ghosts.
Unknowing of my coming, unknowing of my going.

Then grasp the Hidden Ancestor Mudra:
First palace conceals my ancestors,
Second palace conceals my father,
Third palace conceals my mother,
Fourth palace conceals my wife,
Fifth palace conceals my concubine,
Sixth palace conceals my sons,
Seventh palace conceals my grandsons,
Left three palaces conceal my dwelling,
Right three palaces conceal my body.
Marshal Guan Yu of the Administrative Bureau,
Swiftly transform my form—
Visualize as the body of this marshal.

Next, emit the mudra and activate the Five Blacks:
Heaven black, earth black,
People black, ghosts black,
Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers—ink-black.

The Sealing-Off Mudra:
First, sever the path of mountain *xiaos*,
Second, seal the gate of stone spirits,
Third, cut off human tracks,
Fourth, break the lineage of all ghosts,
Fifth, block the path of the Heavenly Master’s coming,
Sixth, erase the traces of the Earthly Master’s going,
Seventh, sever grudges and curses,
Eighth, shut the eight temples and eight *chang* gates,

Heaven’s Dao, heavenly spirits sever at *hài*,
Earth’s Dao, earthly spirits sever at *sì*,
Human Dao, human spirits sever at *shēn*,
Ghost Dao, ghostly spirits sever at *gèn*.
Cut off heavenly plagues and earthly anomalies,
Heterodox masters and ghostly thieves.
No turning back, no wheeling steeds—
Upward cleave heaven in two,
Downward split earth in half,
Sever the five roads of *ming* and *yang*,
Banish all ghosts from the world’s paths.
Block the heterodox arts of Mount Lu,
Seal the hundred ghost gates of Mount Lu.
Named but nameless—called Mount Lu.
Drag the head downward to fix the root source.

Next, raise both hands to summon the bronze fence and iron barrier,
The karma wind whirls to sever the Dipper,
Instantly lock and cut off earth’s veins.
Five Directions’ clerks and soldiers—nine hundred million hosts,
Nine Hell’s chief clerks—hasten to prepare.
Should any disobey, the nine heavens’ lightning will seize and deliver them to the nether darkness.
*Swiftly, as per the Northern Emperor’s statutes—*
*Oṃ kumbhi tuludhā nṛtya hūṃ hūṃ hasten to manifest true form!*
*Oṃ hūṃ dili catur Tiānpéng yín-wén!*
*Oṃ ludhili Tiānwén Yóu-wén!*
*Oṃ hūṃ lidhā catur Yìshèng zhōng-wén!*
*Oṃ zhīduōlī catur Yòushèng sì-wén!*

*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ goudīnà báidīnà jíjínà lóunà xīdánà dǐxīnà bátóunà báyē shè!*
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ jùdī dīshē sūzhā hērě mìdì wūdūzhā jùqízhā suōlàidìzhā yēwēirězhā jùyēzhā shìmózhā suōhē!*

The Fengdu Administrative Bureau’s Severing Dharma, Transformation, and Concealment Mudra:
I come from Heaven’s Gate at *hài*,
My body emerges from Earth’s Portal at *sì*,
Spring thunder at my left in *mǎo*,
Autumn thunder at my right in *yǒu*,
Summer thunder before me at *wǔ*,
Winter thunder behind me at *zǐ*,
Heavenly thunder caps my head with a double canopy,
Earthly thunder covers my feet with a double base.

Entering the Altar: Threefold Purification and Summoning the Merit Officers
One stick of Dao incense—may the ten directions be solemnly purified.
Three rolls of the Dharma drum—may the myriad spirits all assemble.

Before the altar, burn incense and proclaim the summons:
Call forth the Five Thunders’ Duty-Officers of the Day, the Merit Officers, the Envoy-Scribes, the Incense Officials, the Earth Gods, and all deities—upon hearing this command, hasten to arrive.

*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*
Merit Officers, come swiftly.
*Svāhā.*

Recite the right-hand incantation seven times in one breath, visualize the Merit Officer arriving from the northwest, inhale, and blow forward while declaring:
The Merit Officer Envoy has arrived at the ritual altar.
I humbly beseech you to convey this heart-incense upward to the Thunder Bureau, and summon such-and-such Marshal to swiftly come before the altar, for there is a task to be entrusted.

Summoning Rite:
The Northern Emperor □□, root of the ten thousand *qi*.
Divine transformations, wondrous shifts—naturally attaining perfection.
Five-colored clouds swirl and coil, the constellations stand in solemn array.
Hasten to obey the statutes and commands of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.

*Kuí* linked □□, the Zi Heavenly Origin—magnificent and towering.
At Wu, the golden *qi* spreads and presses down; at Mao, the thunderous roar shakes all.
At You, the Li shell detonates with a crash; at the center, Mount Kunlun is split asunder.
Toppled and subdued, the baleful forces are seized.
By the Northern Emperor’s command, the Wheel of Universal Numinous Power takes hold.

*Xū chén dǒu*
*Oṃ xīyí tí lán tuó yē shè.*

*Xū chén dǒu*
*Oṃ □ sū zhà chì shà shè.*

*Xū chén dǒu*

Rightward slash to the left, envision verdant *qi* billowing—behold the Yiling Courtyard of Mount Tai, where the Original Master appears in wrathful aspect. Exhale the *yǐ* syllable to illumine him, then intone:

*Oṃ hūṃ zhà lī hè ān wà □ dì shè.*

Solemnly summon the Earthly Deity, Controller of the Yiling Luminous Might, Supreme General Wen Qiong—hasten swiftly.

Exhale verdant *qi* toward the East, with both eyes’ golden light piercing the left. Within the azure *qi*, the Marshal appears—draw in the secret syllable to the Gallbladder Palace, where Ancestral *Qi* merges with golden light, surging in thunderous resonance. Wood *qi* invades Earth; golden light assails Wood. Envision the Primordial Master employing the three syllables *yàn xī yí*, as the Marshal’s majestic presence blazes forth. Arriving at the altar’s left, he manifests before you. Recite the heart mantra:

*Hū hūṃ mó xī shè.*

Repeat the rightward mantra seven times in a single breath, directing intent as the matter requires.

**Personal Talisman:**
*A single iron rod, a thousand catties in weight—*
*Strikes down all unrighteous spirits under Heaven.*

Trace the talisman with the brush: slash the *shè* character toward *Kūn*, then strike outward toward *Sì*; slash the *shè* character toward *Gèn*, aligning with the Dipper and the Sacred Peaks.

**Secret Mantra:**
*□ dispatch □ summon □□ sound Yī—*
*Expel baleful *qi* □□ where it lingers, pacify □□—*
*Heavenly Stars □ Earthly Luminaries, respond to the Purple Tenuity □ True King □ Sacred Peak’s command □□.*

*Oṃ hū lú lī zhà fèi □□□ xī □ qián bì lī zhà □ Wēn Qióng jí shè.*

**Ignite.**

Proclaim before the Marshal: proceed to so-and-so’s household to seize and capture. Dispatch him with the Heavenly Canopy Mantra:

*Oṃ. □□ Wēn Qióng shè.*

Should you fail to seize them, the Earth Sovereign and Earth Deities shall seize them in your stead. *Swiftly, swiftly, in the name of the August Earth Sovereign and Earth Deities, by statute and command—strike, seize, and dispatch with thunderous might!*

For households afflicted by grave illness, inscribe this before the deities of the Bureau of Destiny and have the sufferer ingest it. □.

The *ké* character enters at the tip of the right rod; draw the baleful *qi* from the *Gèn* Palace into the talisman. Recite: *Swiftly, swiftly, in the name of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, Heavenly Culmen, Benevolent and Sacred Emperor, by statute and command—seize!*

Upon completing the recitation, let out a great shout—*hūng*—and with both hands, inscribe the Greater Yang and Lesser Yin, rubbing them together to generate warmth. Then circulate the Water and Fire within the body, ascending and descending to merge them, and with a clap of thunder, strike them into the talisman. Stamp the left foot once upon the earth, and with both hands form the *zǐ* mudra, passing the thumb over the four fingers to complete the seal. Circulate the union of Kidney and Heart toward the Heart, and with another thunderclap, strike it into the talisman.

In matters of utmost urgency, incorporate this text into the talisman along with the taboo name of the Peak. Recite: *Swiftly, swiftly, by the authority of the Lady of Primordial Mystery and Serene Stability, Zhang Shidao Hui, entrusted to her son Wen [so-and-so], in accordance with the Tiger’s Mouth mandate—enforce!*

Inscribe the □ character by hand and recite the preceding text. Whenever Marshal Wen is summoned to a household to sweep away violent demons and malevolent influences, or to dispel pestilential *qi* during epidemics, infuse this Five-Thunder talisman. There shall be a response from the Hidden Thunder, and the demonic spirits will retreat of their own accord.

Upon completing the inscription, recite the four characters *Oṃ hūṃ lú zhà* into the talisman. At its center, inscribe a single character, visualizing within the ancestral *qi* another character, resplendent with golden light. Then summon the Five Thunders in the form of boar-headed figures, each bearing a royal drum, advancing from the *Kūn* Palace to converge upon the character atop the incense. Merge them into one, then draw them into the talisman with a single inhalation. Employ the Heavenly Canopy Mantra to dispatch them: ㄇ. As before, use both hands to perform the mudra, shout with thunderous force, and strike the seal into the talisman, forming the Eight Points of Gold. What are the Eight Points of Gold? They are the eight encircling strokes.

*Command and restrain the Earth Deities:*
*Oṃ.*

Invoking the Creative Power to Subdue and Seize:
*Oṃ hūṃ lú zhà* □ *zhà lǐ chì* □ *lǐ lǐ jī xī.*

I invoke the Thunderous Might to subdue and seize.
The Three Heavens’ Great Saints, the Four Sagely Primordial Lords.
Heavenly Canopy, Heavenly Canopy, Nine Mysterious Subduing Youths.
Celestial Pivot and Earthly Axis lie within my grasp.
The Five Ding Generals, Gao Diao and Northern Elder.
The Seven Governors and Eight Spirits, the Supreme White Might.
Long-skulled Beasts of Vast Proportions, wielding the Emperor’s Bell.
The Three White Owls, sternly mounted upon Kui Dragons.
Mighty Sword Spirit-Kings, severing evil and eradicating traces.
Purple *qi* ascends the heavens, cinnabar clouds surge forth.
Devouring demons and consuming ghosts, their bodies stretched across the wind.
Green-tongued and jade-toothed, the Four-Eyed Elder.
Heavenly Ding Warriors, warding off misfortune from the south.
Heavenly Couriers, fierce and wrathful, bearing blades from the north.
Three hundred thousand troops encircle and guard my ninefold layers.
Expelling corpses a thousand *li* away, driving off all inauspiciousness.
Should any petty ghost dare appear,
the Heaven-Splitting Great Axe shall sever its fivefold form.
The Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Northern Dipper’s burning bones.
The Four Luminaries shatter its remains, the Heavenly Plan annihilates its kind.
With a single stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Father, the Numinous Might, the Venerable Spirit, the Primordial Void, the Great Marshal commands to subdue and seize.
*Mì mì lǐ.*
Bind swiftly, seize without delay.
Mountain specters, *wangliang*, the Five Pestilences, the Six Afflictions—fifteen kinds in all—wayward spirits and perverse demons, swiftly beclouded and bewildered, seized.
Rectify the Mechanism, align the *Gang* and *Heng*, guard the Pattern.

*Right Mudra:*
From the root of the thumb, proceed through *yín*, *mǎo*, *chén*, and *sì*, then press the subduing pattern. Tracing the Dipper and severing the *Gang* is also efficacious.
*Hū* pertains to the *qi* of liver and gallbladder; the Celestial *Gang* resides in *chén*.

After inscribing the talisman, seal this secret within. Then inscribe again a *Kui* Dipper, and recite the *Dharani* of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Star Lords.
To safeguard the prosperity of the six livestock, employ the Heavenly Canopy Mantra to dispatch them.
For treating swine and cattle plagues, append the three characters *xū*, *xiàng*, *xié*.
In ordinary use, this tabooed brilliance need not be employed.
In urgent matters, use the Fire Dipper; its awe-inspiring power manifests instantly.

**The Five *Qi* Transformations:**
Wood flourishes in spring as the East, its color green, its *qi* harmonious, corresponding to the liver’s *xū*.
Fire flourishes in summer as the South, its color red, its *qi* hot, corresponding to the heart’s *hē*.
Metal flourishes in autumn as the West, its color white, its *qi* solemn, corresponding to the lungs’ *sì*.
Water flourishes in winter as the North, its color black, its *qi* cold, corresponding to the kidneys’ *chuī*.
Earth, lodged in the flourishing of the four seasons, is the Center, its color yellow, its *qi* warm, corresponding to the spleen’s *pēng*.

**Transmission of the Perfected Void Heavenly Master’s Shape-Shifting Talisman:**
Inscribe the character for "subduing ghosts," envisioning the brush as a halberd, subduing three thousand *li* of stern subduing officials and soldiers, entering the well and emerging again with the brush.
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ tāo tāo xī qīng líng gāng jué Oṃ* □ *sū zhà chì shā shè zǐ wǔ.*
*Oṃ xīn hūṃ zǔ gōng zhà dǎn lǐ*, exhale through the nose, inhale through the mouth, stamp the left foot upon the ground, and shake with fury to expel.
By the Great Honored Emperor’s command, the Eight-Headed Primordial Lord issues the decree.
Nine times, visualize a golden wheel of light, with all the generals manifest within.
Envision the solar wheel in the heart, emitting the character *yì*; envision the lunar wheel in the kidney palace, luminous and clear, emitting the character *zhá* to ascend the gallbladder vase.

**Seated Practice:**
At dawn and dusk, sit in stillness, unstained by a single speck of dust, all thoughts silenced. For three cycles of seven, raise both palms, and knock the teeth nine times.

**Application of the Void-Day Rat:**
Avoid the *Yàn* and *Wēi* months.
Rub the palms together, uniting the water and fire *qi*. Upon seeing a sun-like orb of light in the left palm, recite the *Dharani* of the Taiyin’s Transformation, the Heavenly Canopy Mantra, and the Heart Mantra forty-nine times. Envision *Wēn Qióng* manifesting within the light of the right palm, and silently petition for the matter at hand. Recite the Heavenly Canopy Mantra, and draw the light into the gallbladder. Then draw nine breaths of the Eastern green *qi* into the gallbladder, envisioning it as a lapis lazuli vase, within which the tortoise and snake intertwine, coalescing into a golden orb of light like a silver pearl. Exhale it onto the incense, round as a bright mirror, within which Marshal *Wēn* appears.

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Forty-Three concludes:
#1 *The Great Law of the Dark Mystery’s Ghost-Subduing Marshal*: Transmitted by the Northern Emperor.
#2 *The Great Law of the Earth Deity Marshal Wēn*: Transmitted by the Northern Emperor.

*Compendium of Daoist Methods*, Scroll 254, *Secret Methods for Summoning and Examining the Eastern Marchmount’s Marshal Wēn*, Preface to the Numinous Text states:
Marshal *Wēn* is the Eastern Marchmount’s Commander of Troops, the Celestial Inspector General of the World, and the Keeper of Urgent Human Cases. His might and strange manifestations are unparalleled; whatever is petitioned, none fails to meet the heart’s desire.
During the Tang, at the request of the Heavenly Master *Yè Fǎshàn*, he was entrusted with governing the ghosts of pestilence. "To save a sick father, the people of Shu were all cured within a month. Later, he manifested again, saying: 'I wish to assist the world’s ritual officers in their practice, capturing malevolent spirits and curing illnesses. Now, I possess secret talismanic methods; I hope they will be propagated.'" Heavenly Master *Yè* thus transmitted this method to later disciples. In the space of a breath, its responses were resoundingly clear.
The same work’s *Great Law of the Earth Deity Marshal Wēn* belongs to the same lineage and serves as a mutual reference.

*Dharma Ocean’s Lost Pearls*, Scroll Forty-Four:
*The Great Law of Marshal Yīn, Inspector of the Earth Bureau*

The Master of the Law is the Patriarch, Immortal Lord of Southern Prosperity, *Liào Zhēnrén*. The Marshal in Command: *Yīn Yuánshuài*, the Earth Bureau’s Inspector of the Year-Star, Supreme Virtue of the Northern Culmen’s Divine Presence, who aids the Dao, annihilates essences, and extirpates demons—his name is *Jiāo*. He appears as a youthful visage, with a green face, red hair, twin topknots bound in a coiled headwrap, a cyan body, bare legs, clad in a black-green crimson robe, a red skirt cinched at the waist, and a necklace of twelve skulls. In his left hand, he holds a golden bell; in his right, a yellow halberd. Stout and short, he stands amidst black clouds, with a yellow banner and leopard-tail attendants flanking him.

The Deputy Marshal: *Jiǎng Shǐzhě*, the Swift-Seizing Evocator of the Dipper’s Numinous Manifestation—his name is *Ruì*. He resembles a *Kinnara* king: fanged, crimson-lipped, barefoot, with large golden rings in his ears. His complexion is purple or green-faced, with a headband, red hair, a floral red robe, and upturned boots. He wields a noose, with *gongcao* officials at his side.

The Yellow Banner General: *Lú Míng*.
The Leopard-Tail General: *Lǐ Zhòngwén*.
The Yellow Halberd General: *Guān Lóng*.
The Golden Bell General: *Chén Tuòjī*.
The Nine-*Qi* General of the East: *Gōng Wénwáng*.
The Three-*Qi* General of the South: *Zhāng Zōngyì*.
The Seven-*Qi* General of the West: *Xīmén Bào*.
The Five-*Qi* General of the North: *Wú Zhèngwén*.
The Central *Qi*-Governing General: *Liú Zhōng*.
The Seventy-Two Seasonal Sovereign Generals: *Sòng Wénxíng*.
The Twenty-Four *Qi* Generals: *Hán Bǎo*.

This method seizes the Three *Qi* and Nine *Liáng*, dispels the Five Pestilences and Six Afflictions.

**Summoning Incantation:**
Fierce officers of the Year-Star, marshaling all spirits,
With the yellow banner leading, the leopard-tail following,
The seventy-two seasons, the twenty-four *qi*,
Malevolent *sha* at the fore, baleful gods as guards.
The yellow halberd executes essences; the golden bell strikes *sui*.
Envoys of the Five Directions, potent and awe-inspiring.
By the Emperor’s decree, descend swiftly,
Aid my great Dao, sweep away demonic essences.
Whoever resists the Dao shall be beheaded and presented.
By the statutes of *Xuándū*, slay ghosts without delay.
*Hasten! Hasten!* In accordance with the statutes of the Northern Culmen’s Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.

**Decree:** Summon *Yīn Jiāo*, the fierce officer of the Earth Bureau under the Northern Emperor of Supreme Clarity, to arrive swiftly. *Hasten!*

Gaze into the yellow *qi* of the central heavens; the master’s eyes inscribe the characters *Yīn Jiāo*, then blow them into the clouds—the Marshal appears. Draw him into the spleen palace to merge, then exhale before the altar. Blow toward the northeast, where the union is absent, and together with Marshal *Jiǎng*, they manifest instantly. *Nì.*

**Mantra:** *Oṃ hūṃ* [syllables obscured] *vam*, the incantation of subjugation.

**Gèn *Qi* Blow:** Seal and fix [obscured] *heavenly hail, earthly* [obscured] *human* [obscured].

**Marshal’s Talisman:**
By decree of the Northern Culmen, summon *Yīn Jiāo* swiftly.
All gods bear the command—slay ghosts, devour essences.
Whoever resists shall die. By the Emperor’s decree.
*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ*, incantation of the fierce officers of the Year-Star, applied in black ink.
*Nì*, used in conjunction with the Year-Star of the current year’s cyclical sign.
**Secret Incantation.**

By the Emperor’s decree, *Yīn Jiāo* shall universally save all beings, drive out evil and malevolence, and swiftly hasten to the altar. *Yīn Jiāo*, Marshal of the Origin, hasten to the altar—by breath you shall respond, swiftly descend, and urgently report. Hasten to act without delay.

**Examination and Binding:**
May the sun, moon, and stars swiftly shift the soul. With the Dipper mudra in the left hand and the sword mudra in the right, visualize the body from crown to feet, reciting the invocation to the numinous generals of heaven and earth to gather and seize the soul. From the feet, reverse the sword mudra upward to the crown, imagining the Three Hun in the form of Daoist adepts—azure, yellow, and white—emerging from the crown in sequence with the sword mudra. Press the tongue against the upper palate to form a golden bridge, then inhale, drawing the three adepts into the golden tower and jade hall within the master’s abdomen. Immediately command the officers and clerks to press the case into the body.

**Thunder chariots and thunderclaps, the Water Spirit Generals.**
When malevolence enters the yang body, it becomes as cool as ice. The heavenly generals conduct internal interrogation, compelling it to reveal its name.

**Hasten! Hasten! As the Emperor’s statutes and decrees command.**

**Talisman for Reporting Offenders:**
Inscribe the three decrees on the front and affix the subsequent talisman on the reverse.

**Breaking Ground:**
*Huò líng líng* [syllables obscured] *tiān xīng* [obscured] *dì yào*, *niè*—commonly used for dispersing miasmic harmony to cure pestilence. Cut paper into an octagon, inscribe the talisman, and affix it outside. Take a piece of cat bamboo, one foot and two inches long (add one inch in a leap month), inscribe the talisman upon it, and strike the offending direction forty-nine times with an axe while reciting the *Yù Gào* once, until it is exhausted. Then dispatch the *chén* and *xū* Dipper, alternating *xū* and *chén*, followed by the stars *Poverty, Giant, Wealth, Literature, Humility, Military, Ruin*.

For clandestine repairs, affix the talisman to the eastern pillar of the ridgepole, then strike the ground at the breaking point three times with an axe. When moving earth, affix the talisman to the worksite and dig three times at the starting point.

For celestial pestilence, first offer thanks, then perform the exorcism using the talisman as prescribed. For terrestrial pestilence caused by breaking ground or laying foundations, where the household’s lamps and fires dim, appeal to Marshal *Tǔ Huáng* of the Origin, taking soil from the direction where the earth was disturbed and casting it into the altar.

For ship pestilence, issue a document and dispatch the talisman at will. For prison pestilence, send the marshals to oversee the city god’s seizure. For livestock pestilence, inscribe a bamboo slip and place it in the pen, then strike the talisman into vinegar and charcoal to restore peace.

To recover runaway servants, inscribe the talisman and affix it upside-down above the stove—it will appear at once. For lost cats or dogs, inscribe the talisman on white paper and affix it above the stove—they will appear at once.

To cure malevolence, inscribe the talisman on an iron plaque and drive it in with nails. For insects or birds damaging crops, dispatch the local earth god.

**Right:** Each of these methods requires three impressions of the master’s seal, stamped in sequence to summon and employ agents at will. For major matters, submit a memorial and issue a document with the dispatch talisman. Generally, adjust the prayers according to the situation, then affix the three decrees and seal them. On the reverse of the three-decree talisman, inscribe *Hé Míng Tiān Dì Rì* ("Conjoined Radiance of Heaven and Earth"). An octagonal talisman may be used, affixed to the four directions.

**Earth Bureau Talisman and Seal:**
The octagonal talisman appears in the master’s method.

*Encounter people—people perish;*
*Encounter ghosts—ghosts are annihilated.*

**Self-Respect Incantation**

Demonic forces return to rectitude.
Should any refuse to submit,
Be reduced to dust.
Mighty Envoy Yin Jiao of the Earth Bureau,

Thereafter, command the marshal to personally present the memorial for averting stellar offenses, earthly retributions, monthly afflictions, illnesses, hastening childbirth, and further supplications.

For retributive offenses, determine the Celestial Stem’s position in the month, then align the hour accordingly. Inquire of the mountain’s orientation to ascertain the afflicted direction. The Celestial Stem’s arrival at the site of retribution is most efficacious.

Three Stars of the Northern Dipper,
By the decree of the Supreme Emperor I act.

The Year’s Virtue, Venerable Deity,
Bears this talismanic mandate,
To sweep away and annihilate demonic essences.
Let no calamity arise,
Nor wrongfully harm Our people.
*Oṃ bhuḥ tvaṃ.*

Hasten to press forth, report and give thanks to the Earthly Mansion.
All spirit-slayers—
Should any dare defy this command,
Be forever consigned to the Northern Darkness.
May the people know peace, all things flourish,
And the Dao’s qi endure eternally.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.*

Hasten to recall all slayers of Heaven, Earth, Year, Month, Day, and Hour.
For treating pestilence, add the secret characters below.

**Demon (魅).**
*Jade Edict, Jade Formula:*
If the patient’s face is flushed and head aches, they have offended the Celestial Stars—resolve with the Heavenly Talisman. □.
If the patient has offended the Earthly Luminaries, resolve with the Earthly Talisman.
If the patient is afflicted by ghostly hauntings, treat with this.

**Three Secret Decrees Within**
**Heavenly Emperor’s Decree:**
Revolve the Dipper, traverse the Winnowing Basket,
Reverse the course of the Five Constants.
Responding to the Nine Heavens above,
Sun, moon, and stars—all may be commanded and moved.
Memorials may be presented, thunder and lightning driven and employed,
All matters assigned to the Steed.

**Human Emperor’s Decree:**
Govern the Five Qi at the center,
Blend and harmonize the hundred spirits.
Responding to the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams,
The meridians and fields of the body,
Regulate and harmonize primordial qi,
Sever and decapitate corpse-pestilence,
All matters assigned to the Steed.

**Earthly Emperor’s Decree:**
Decree and command the earthly deities,
Escort and receive with attendance.
Responding to the Nine Provinces’ astrological divisions,
The Nine Ramparts’ Earthly Emperors,
The spirit-slayers of yin-yang and the four directions—
All are subject to control,
Ghosts and spirits may be decapitated and subdued.

To the right, inscribe the Three Decrees,
Followed by the ancestral taboo name,
To seal the Northern Emperor’s decree,
Invoke the Earth-Decree,
With the Five Yang above to supplement and give thanks,
The Five Yin below to receive the command.

**Eight Transformations**
*Oṃ □ dī □ kā hūṃ grabha.*
To the right: for earth-breaking in the *Gèn* (Northeast) direction.

*Oṃ □ □ va li tí □ grabha.*
To the right: for reporting offenses in the *Qián* (Northwest) direction.

*Oṃ ma ṇi da li hūṃ grabha.*
To the right: for earth-gratitude in the *Duì* (West) direction.

*Xiāo □ tí □ li □ grabha.*
To the right: for treating illness—use the upper for cold, the lower for heat.

*Zhà nuò hūṃ duō zhà nǎ grabha.*
To the right: for treating hauntings in the *Gèn* (Northeast) direction.

*Mā wū □ hūṃ hūṃ □ grabha.*
To the right: for initiating mourning in the *Xùn* (Southeast) direction.

□: third, Earthly Luminaries.
*Yù* (玉), *cháng* (常): commonly used.

**Great Method of Thunder Arrows**
When Heaven and Earth convulse,
Yin and yang clash and flay,
All pertain to baleful stars and great luminaries,
The flourishing qi of poisonous thunder,
Thunder arrows, thunder-slayers—
All are transmitted by ancestral masters.
Point and shoot according to the diagrams,
Harmonize and transform creation,
Balance and regulate yin and yang,
Sever and cast down demonic stars,
Verify talismans and observe correspondences.

For example, the *Liúhuǒ* (Flowing Fire) baleful star is the Great Yang.
The *Jīnhǔ* (Golden Tiger) great slayer is governed by the Celestial Stem—
This is the star of the Western *Tàibái* (Venus), the flowing metal,
Presided over by the Great Yin, the thunder-slayer.
The *Hēiléi* (Black Thunder) and *Léihǔ* (Thunder Tiger) slayers
Are the gods of the *Fāntiān Fùdì* (Heaven-Overturning, Earth-Covering) slayer.
When the talismanic mandate of the *Liúhuǒ* baleful star offends the *Jīnhǔ*,
It responds through the black slayer of thunder and rain.
This star pertains to metal, that talisman to fire—
The principle of fire overcoming metal.

The gods of *Fāntiān Fùdì*
Are to be met with the flying-sword talisman for severing corpses.
To offend them is to slay and subdue the thunder master’s family.
Cover and shield with the Heavenly Emperor’s command,
Or the ritual master will suffer the calamity.
Moreover, on *jiǎ-sì* days,
When the dragon soars and the rooster crows at dawn,
Arriving at the land of *Hēiléi*, *Hēihǔ*, and *Jīnhǔ*,
It is especially swift and efficacious.

Generally, when the Grand Year resides in its palace, arise,
Seek the dwelling of the thunder-slayer,
And shoot it with the thunder arrow—this is critical.
Each arrow has its own method of activation and diagram.

**Procedures for Mobilization**
For example, if the response is due on a certain day,
The day prior, seek the direction of the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger.
Then summon with the master’s own talisman.
Upon arrival, visualize each spirit’s attire and colors,
Offer tea, and state the purpose.

Next, circulate the Nine Qi and blow upon the blade,
Slaughter the chicken with the right hand holding the knife,
The left hand cutting, dripping blood into the wine vessel *bǐng*.
Place the chicken in the baleful direction.
Again, circulate the Nine Qi into the wine,
Spray the chicken toward the *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger’s direction,
And command: *Liúhuǒ* White Tiger,
At such-and-such day and hour, manifest the great response!

Prepare four documents:
Inscribe the Jade Emperor’s decree,
Fire Earl’s talisman,
Thunder character talisman,
Nine Qi talisman—
Four talismanic mandates, divided into eight pieces.
Four pieces affixed to the front of the documents,
The remaining four reserved for summoning the generals at the altar.

For the document to the altar’s official generals,
Use one Fire Earl’s talisman, divided into two pieces,
Applied as before.
Inscribe notes on the reverse for efficacy.
Then, facing the direction of the direct talisman, burn it,
Summon the direct talisman, and present the memorial text,
Submitting it to the respective offices.

Also prepare a Grand Year document,
Commanding the leadership of this year’s flourishing qi,
White Tiger, *Liúhuǒ* official talismans,
Sword, Vermilion Bird, and the Four Thunder Arrows,
To arise in such-and-such direction,
Raising clouds and spitting mist,
Greatly shaking the thunderous sound.
When the matter is complete and the merit accomplished,
Do not forget to report and requite.

Affix a complete Grand Year talisman to the front of the document,
Burn it toward the Grand Year’s direction.
At the appointed hour, observe the White Tiger’s direction for activation.
Return to pacify and circulate the scriptures.
At dawn, observe whether qi is present.
Prepare four recall-slayer talismans,
Secretly burn them together in the incense burner—
The response will surely be great.

If the qi is black and the slayer’s arrival fierce,
Hastily burn the resolution talisman in the burner.
After a moment, transform it into a sudden fire,
Press the thunder talisman, and urge the thunder and rain unceasingly.

For *liù-yǐ* mobilizations,
Prepare a summons the day prior, and burn it at the appointed time.
If unresponsive, next use the *xīn* talisman to urge the summons,
Then the *dèng* talisman to urge the summons.

Next, observe the Thunder Bureau issuing its command. Examine where the day’s *sha* direction lies, then proceed to that direction to plant the banner and take position. Thereafter, circulate the scriptures to summon the Five Thunder Celestial Stem Metal Terrace Generals—Earth, Metal, Water, and the Moon’s Water.

*Sever the rainbow, slay the demonic miasma—by imperial decree, their bodies shall be severed inch by inch. The thunderclaps issue commands without delay. As stars shift and the *huòluò* descends, swiftly sever, swiftly execute. Hasten! As the statute commands.*

With the right hand, inscribe the character *jìn* (聻) in golden light into the talisman.

**Dispatch Incantation:**
*By the Emperor’s decree, I wield the flying sword to sever the celestial demons. Where my blade arrives, the rainbow and miasma shall perish at once. Hasten! As the statute commands.*

**Talisman for Overturning the Sea to Bring Rain:**

no delay permitted.
Five Directions’ Community Decrees,
swiftly enact as commanded.
Mystery follows mystery’s rectitude,
flight follows the great thousand.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Supreme Thunder Lord’s Law!

**Five Thunder’s Secret Essentials**

**Precelestial Jade Clarity Decree-Charging Incantation:**
Green Emperor’s kerchief,
Red Emperor’s headband.
White Emperor’s robes,
Black Emperor’s bridle.

The Yellow Emperor’s grandson,
the Grand Sovereign’s office—
coming from Non-Boundary,
departing from Non-Realm.
I summon you to stir as wind and thunder,
to manifest as thunderclap.
Eastern slave-child, Wooden Lad of the Kerchief;
Southern slave-child, Flaming Cap of Radiance;
Western slave-child, Golden Victory Robes;
Northern slave-child, Bridle of Flowing Fire;
Central slave-child, Grandson of the Yellow Ultimate—
together they set the thunder’s roar in motion from the Xun quarter.
The thunderclap’s sound rises from the earth,
ascending into the Thunder Citadel to aid the Perfected King.

When the incantation is complete, grasp the Great Thunder Chart,
settle the spirit in stillness for a moment.
After a long while, my body becomes like Kongtong,
envisioning the five viscera as cavernous grottoes,
within which thunder chariots revolve,
thunder resounds, clouds and mist swirl,
lightning and fire encircle all.
I inwardly circulate and seal the qi with urgency,
until sweat flows freely from every pore and hair follicle.
Then swiftly recite the All-Heaven Thunder Duke’s incantation:
*Great Wooden Lad, encircle all.*

In the midst of this visualization,
I see the crown of my head split open,
my primordial destiny seated within a golden hall and jade chamber.
At this moment, form and body are suddenly forgotten—
I am my primordial destiny,
my primordial destiny is me.
Auspicious light and numinous qi
envelop my body.
Above, in the celestial vault,
the Jade Clarity Perfected King’s palace appears,
black clouds spreading wide,
thunder and lightning interweaving,
wind and rain scattering in all directions.
The Xun gate splits open,
a great thunderclap shakes the earth,
opening the earth’s veins,
springs and sources gush forth.
My primordial destiny ascends to the Jade Clarity Perfected King’s palace,
memorializing the matter at hand,
requesting the descent of decrees and commands,
the issuance of thunder and lightning,
the dispatch of marshals and generals,
entrusting me with discretionary authority.

After receiving the decree, I bow in farewell,
returning to the Muddy Ninefold Jade Chamber.
Within the black thunder, I see
the assembled spirits of the Thunder Department,
the functionaries of wind, cloud, thunder, rain, and lightning.
At this point, I recite the Five Thunder’s Secret Incantation,
visualizing the Five Spirits descending before me,
all the spirits entering my thunder-orifices and cavernous grottoes.
After a long while, I gently open my eyes—
my primordial destiny and I merge as one.
Then I take up the brush to inscribe talismans,
or ascend the altar to summon generals and perform the rites.

The well of Grand Primordial Chaos,
the Supreme Ultimate’s mysterious luminosity.
The Supreme Ultimate’s profound vastness—
the Two Modes emerge.
○ The Three and Five crisscross,
the Four and Seven radiate their numinosity.
Thunder Duke and Generals,
descend to the imperial court.
I decree to you, Thunder Spirits:
let thunderclaps shake and startle.
Wind, cloud, thunder, rain—
ten thousand blacks seethe and surge.
Shatter mountains, uproot trees,
overturn seas, pour down in torrents.
Wind and thunder vast and boundless,
rain’s force roaring and resounding.
Strike and subdue demonic spirits,
thunderclaps intersect and cross.
All as decreed by the Thunder’s Law!

When inscribing the well-character with this method,
one beholds the unilluminated state before heaven and earth,
the Grand Primordial Chaos,
the Supreme Ultimate’s mysterious obscurity—
all the unseparated beginning.
When the Two Modes emerge,
life’s intent gradually sprouts.
One gives rise to two,
two gives rise to three,
three gives rise to the myriad things.
Heaven and earth, humans and creatures,
wind, cloud, thunder, rain,
lightning, frost, numinous herbs and trees—
all are complete.
After receiving qi,
the two kidneys form first,
then the two eyes,
then the limbs, viscera, and their numbers.
The two eyes are the sun and moon.
Their flashing is lightning,
their rumbling in the ears is thunder,
their breath is wind,
their sweat is rain.
Yet if one speaks of the primordial creation,
none of these—wind, cloud, thunder, rain—
are anything but matters of the posterior heaven.

*Dharma Sea’s Lost Pearls, Scroll Forty-Five*

*The Purple Palace Mysterious Writ*

It is said that of all afflictions that plague human breath, none is more grievous than consumptive wasting. No physician or shaman in the world can cure it. Once one person falls ill, the malady spreads through the entire clan, even to the point of extinguishing the family line. None dare approach, hence it is called "corpse-transmitted consumption." Some burn the dead in the mountains and wilds; others cast them into rivers, refusing burial. Descendants sever ties of bone and flesh; husbands and wives lose the bond of mutual regard. How tragic indeed!

Those who treat this illness fail to suppress the Three Corpses and Nine Worms. Talismans prove ineffective—how could mere physicians or shamans succeed? Now, a treasured secret is revealed, to be imparted only to those deemed worthy, transmitted through the heart. If one whose nature and conduct are not gentle and sincere obtains this text without the master’s guidance, recklessly practices it, or carelessly divulges it, the calamity will extend to nine generations—an unforgivable sin. Beware, beware!

Households afflicted by this malady must submit a written petition to the altar, declaring their life’s origin and detailing when the illness began and its present symptoms. If they experience inauspicious nightmares or see ghosts of deceased kin, they must clearly describe these omens. Upon verification of the worms’ presence through talismanic fumigation, a memorial is submitted to the Celestial Emperor and the Ancestral Master, dispatching generals to seize the corpse-transmitting ghosts and the wrongfully deceased kin. After imprisonment and interrogation, talismans are issued to expel the corpse-worms.

After ingesting the talisman, within twenty-one days the disease’s source is expelled. If the body sweats and itches as though worms crawl beneath the skin, swiftly wipe the entire body with cloth and burn it. Some may vomit worm-like forms; others may experience abdominal rumbling and pain, followed by diarrhea. The talisman’s power, infused with thunder-fire and lethal qi, incinerates the corpse-worms, leaving no chance of escape. The worms vary in form, but once the disease’s source is expelled, place them in a vessel and cast it into flowing water.

Then, administer the *Report-and-Response Talisman* to determine which organ is depleted, and use the *Tonifying Talisman* to restore what was damaged. For those with qi and blood stagnation, it is also essential to cultivate a calm mind and nurture their nature, avoiding overexertion. The method requires eighty days of treatment, and after a thousand days, the body is purged—such a person is reborn into the world. If they fail to abstain from the bedchamber or regulate their activities appropriately, survival remains uncertain. The utmost care must be taken, as with a woman in childbirth. Without proper nurturing, if the illness recurs, the danger is grave.

Transmitted by Yan Daolong, styled Zilong, of the Tianpeng lineage.

The method for pursuing and eradicating consumption is indeed the most secret text of Heaven and a rare treasure in the world below. Yet today’s practitioners, without examining the root, merely grasp at the branches, vainly attempting to practice it. I first studied under Master Wu Youkai, who received the transmission from Guo Jundaguan. Guo’s master was Chen Zangxiu, whose master was Guo Jun Huangxi, a disciple of Fan Xuan. Though I obtained this transmission, I remained uncertain whether the root and branches were complete.

My neighbor, Master Xueya, received the lineage from Fan Xuan. Having traversed rivers and lakes, he was a pioneer in this art, reviving the dead and saving lives beyond count. In his later years, he returned home, and I became his disciple. How rare is such a text! I served my master for years, fulfilling the duties of a disciple, even providing his burial shroud and coffin. Fan Xuan, pleased with my devotion, imparted all the profound mysteries of the methods.

For over forty years, I wandered rivers and lakes, and the efficacy of my master’s teachings was as responsive as an echo. Though many sought the Dao, few were deemed worthy of transmission. As the saying goes: "Disciples seek masters easily, but masters seek disciples with difficulty." This is no idle claim.

Moreover, today’s practitioners often corrupt talismans and incantations, rendering them flawed and erroneous. When applied to healing, no response is received. Is the method itself inefficacious? No—it is the failure of transmission. At seventy, I met you, who have studied diligently and whose aspirations are admirable. I shall fully transmit the master’s teachings to propagate the true doctrine.

To future learners: unless you offer gold and treasures, pledge your devotion, and swear before Heaven and Earth, do not lightly divulge this. This is my wish and the fortune of the method. I, Yuanchang, have faithfully upheld my master’s transmission, and its efficacy in practice has long been known. Thus, I compile this volume as a treasured inheritance for saving the world. Should later scholars obtain this text, cherish and practice it, and the ranks of immortals may be attained. To carelessly divulge or profane it invites severe retribution from the Mysterious Tribunal. May the generals and officials of the Ancestral Master bear witness.

Respectfully inscribed by Zhang Yuanchang, fourth-generation descendant of the Tianpeng lineage.

*The Origins of the Tianpeng Lineage*

Long ago, the lineage’s founder, Master Pinlefeng, suffered from consumption. In a dream, a divine being said: "Seek the true immortals of Mount Hua, and your illness may be cured." The master ascended the mountain and resided there for over two months, but his condition worsened. The mountain’s Daoists, fearing his death, refused him lodging. Leaning on his staff, he descended, and halfway down the slope, exhausted, he sat. Suddenly, three Daoists appeared and asked: "Why are you here?" The master explained his plight. The Daoists replied: "Return to the mountain. I have a prescription beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang. Seek Lu Yanghao, and memorialize your illness—it will soon be cured." With that, they vanished.

The master marveled and returned to the mountain. Beneath the seat of the Perfected Wang, he indeed found the text. Lu Yanghao had just ascended the mountain, and the master had him copy and memorialize it. His illness was immediately cured. Thereafter, the master practiced this method among rivers and lakes, achieving manifest responses, and many sought the Dao.

In truth, this transmission employs the Four Generals of the Dharma’s Expedient Methods and the Four Immortals of Mount Shenshan as its foundation, establishing a method to deliver people, called the *Four Generals*. The *Purple Court* incorporates common medicinal herbs like *Yi* and *Qi*, which also prove efficacious.

At that time, Yan Tongpan of Fuzhou, styled Jing’an, established a Daoist abbey to welcome masters of the Dao from across the land. One day, the master arrived, and Yan received him with great courtesy.

Jing’an’s younger brother, Fan Yuanxuan, served him with even greater reverence. The master, pleased by his devotion and recognizing his aptitude for receiving the Dao, transmitted this method to him. Yuanxuan practiced it with remarkable efficacy, though he had yet to deliver others. In his later years, beset by worldly upheavals and family poverty, he relocated to Lixian Township in Chongren, beneath an osmanthus tree on Huolu Ridge. He married a woman of the Zhao clan, whose nature inclined toward drink.

At that time, Guo Xueya of Huangxi, a clansman of the master’s elder brother, also studied under Yuanxuan, and both received the transmission of the *Eight Generals*. Xueya’s practice yielded verification, and he issued a talisman declaring: *"The Daoist methods are further refined across the land, yet the* Purple Court *remains unmatched among rivers and lakes."* Upon seeing this, Yuanxuan remarked, *"Even I have no end to my harmony."* From then on, Huang and Han incurred the master’s displeasure.

Yet Xueya remained at Yuanxuan’s door day and night, serving with labor and obedience beyond that of a slave, though he had still not received the full transmission. When Yuanxuan’s illness grew critical, he said to Xueya, *"Among my four or five disciples, none have served me as you have. I shall die soon, yet I regret that my burial clothes, shroud, coffin, and outer casket remain unprepared—what is to be done?"* Xueya replied, *"Master, do not trouble yourself over this; your disciple will see to each detail."* Yuanxuan, pleased, swore an oath: *"If you provide me with garments, I shall ensure you wear brocade. If you furnish the planks, I shall return two coffins to you."*

He then instructed, *"Bring down the chest from my bed frame."* One by one, he examined the method texts within and handed them to Xueya, saying, *"All has been thoroughly entrusted to you. Yet the method for pursuing consumptive ailments still holds the profound mysteries of the Inner Court—all of which are transmitted orally. Now I pass them to you."* And so he revealed all his secrets.

After Yuanxuan’s death, Xueya clothed him in the prepared garments and buried him in the coffin from his own hall. By this method, Xueya’s name resounded across rivers and lakes. Though some of his disciples received the transmission, only my late father and Shi Yuru did so in full. The two families exchanged letters frequently yet never met, each unaware of what the other had attained.

When Xueya transmitted the method to my late father, he said, *"A hundred taels for the* Purple Court*, fifty taels for the* Flowing Water *method—this is all I teach you. If your son is unteachable, I shall not transmit further. If your grandson proves worthy, you must teach him for me."*

One day, my late father again prepared a token of sincerity and presented it, knowing Xueya had urgent need. Seizing the opportunity, he sought to exhaust all secrets. Xueya smiled and said, *"The method is already complete; there is no need to ask further. The texts you may copy, but you must answer my urgency as I answer yours—like unending gold, I teach you so your descendants may benefit without end."*

From my youth, I followed my late father in treating consumptive ailments for twenty years. Practicing this method for over twenty more, I have seen swift and resonant responses, aided by the efficacy of my late father’s spirit and the authority of his assisting generals.

I have often reflected that those afflicted with consumptive illnesses, as the saying goes, *"hide their ailments."* Truly, this is so. Those who contract such diseases fear others knowing or speaking of it—yet how can they not speak? The afflicted are deluded by ghosts, despising any mention of their condition. By the time they awaken and seek treatment, the illness has already deepened.

Moreover, some physicians, though aware of the consumption and their own inability to cure it, conceal the truth to mislead the patient. Even as death approaches, they claim the illness is harmless. Alas, how can such medicine effect a cure?

Consumption arises from five sources: *wine exhaustion, sexual exhaustion, depletion exhaustion, qi exhaustion,* and *transmitted exhaustion.* Their symptoms appear similar, but *transmitted consumption* involves worms and malevolent spirits, bringing calamity that even kin cannot sever.

Transmitted consumption stems from five causes: contracting the illness from the clothing or fabrics of a consumptive household (*clothing transmission*); acquiring it through the utensils of an afflicted family (*utensil transmission*); inhabiting a consumptive’s dwelling (*dwelling transmission*); consuming food or drink sent by a consumptive household, or partaking of their wine and meat (*food transmission*); or mourning the dead and inhaling the *qi* of their corpse (*corpse transmission*). Those who fall ill without cause suffer from *flying corpse* or *wandering consumption*, often due to grudges, curses, or oral hexes.

When one first contracts the illness, symptoms include alternating chills and fever, aching joints, vexing heat in the five centers, withered hair, dizziness, coughing with phlegm, vomiting or coughing blood, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest oppression, abdominal distension or pain, heartburn, bitter taste, dry tongue, sallow complexion, weakness, cravings for meat, or sudden aversion to food, swollen lymph nodes, nightmares of ghostly unions, seminal emissions, turbid urine, pain radiating from the back to the heart, throat sores, throbbing headaches, and disrupted yin-yang balance. Over years, the symptoms grow increasingly strange: worms may move throughout the body, or one may feel biting in the abdomen or back, or sense them intercepting food in the throat, or emerging from the genitals or anus—such bizarre manifestations are limitless.

In prolonged cases, symptoms worsen: edema, diarrhea, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, emaciated calves, loss of complexion, sore throat, wheezing, chest tightness, crimson lips, flushed face, blood-spotted skin, involuntary seminal emissions in men, uncontrolled vaginal discharge in women, blocked menstruation, throat sores—all dire signs, with ten out of ten cases proving fatal.

For those seeking treatment, one must first compose a sincere petition, detailing the symptoms and their causes. Relying on this, issue talismans for fumigation and verification, submit memorials to the spirits, pursue the worms, and administer restorative treatment to dispel the symptoms. The afflicted must cultivate themselves with utmost care, avoiding physical exertion. If they fail to observe the precepts—succumbing to cold or heat, excessive joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety, overindulging in food or drink, neglecting hunger or overeating, or violating abstinence from wine and sex—if they disregard restorative care and moderation, the illness will soon recur, leaving no hope for recovery.

On the first day of the jiashen year of the Zhizheng era, fifth-generation descendant Zhang Shunlie respectfully inscribed.

**Procedures for Practice**

For all who come to the altar seeking treatment, first write three *Wash-Hand Talismans*, then seven *Fumigate-Brush Talismans*. Have the patient wash their hands with the *Wash-Hand Talisman* and soap, without drying with cloth to avoid lint, allowing the hands to air-dry. Some claim medicinal ingredients are used in the talismans, but I employ only water for washing. Once the hands are dry, rub them together briskly, then examine them closely.

Next, light incense in a censer and burn one *Fumigate-Brush Talisman*, folding it into the flame. Have the patient hold their hands over the smoke, repeating the process for each talisman. Some may show results after one, others after three or five. If fine hairs appear in the smoke or upon re-fumigation, it confirms *consumptive transmission*; if none appear, the condition is not present. Careful observation is essential—mistaking lint for hairs wastes effort in treatment.

When hairs emerge, note their color and location. The five viscera—green, yellow, red, white, and black—each correspond to specific afflictions. The hairs reveal which organ is damaged, their length, thickness, quantity, and whether they stretch, contract, soften, stiffen, or fork. If they appear at the *Heavenly Gate*, *Tiger’s Mouth*, *Ghost’s Door*, palm center, beneath fingers, on the back of the hand, or the upper joints of fingers—left for men, right for women—red or black, long or thick, contracted or extended, numerous, soft, or forked, with strange colors, these are all inauspicious signs. Careful examination reveals the depth of the illness.

If others have been preemptively sought for treatment and fumigation, and hairs appear, pursue the worms; if none appear, return to this altar for re-fumigation. The absence of hairs may result from improper invocation of the spirit-generals to restrain the worms during the initial talisman use, allowing them to escape into the bodies of the patient’s family or hide within walls. Use the proper method to summon and confine them to the patient’s original site of injury. After one or two days, reapply the talismans for fumigation—hairs will surely appear.

In cases where the worms have damaged the kidneys, fumigation often yields no hairs, yet pursuit may still reveal worms. This is a known occurrence.

When hairs appear during fumigation, record the symptoms and submit a petition to the *Northern Emperor*, the *Northern Dipper*, the *Four Saints*, and the *Zongshi of Mount Hua*. Issue talismans to pursue the worms: first, place one *General Talisman* at the front of the room. Then, use forty-nine talismans, ingesting seven daily while awaiting a response.

When the worms descend, signs will manifest akin to the three therapeutic methods of sweating, vomiting, and purging in medicine. Three, seven, or fifteen days after ingesting the talismans, the body may grow hot and sweat—remain still until itching arises, as if insects crawl across the skin. This is the *sweating* response. Wipe the body clean with clothing, then boil and rewear it. Burn the bedding as well.

If nausea and retching occur, the patient will vomit worms, foul phlegm, or undigested food—examine the contents for worms. This is the *vomiting* response. If the abdomen rumbles or aches, signaling a bowel movement, avoid using the latrine. Collect the excrement in a chamber pot; whether loose or hard, worms will be present. This is the *purging* response. Worms expelled through vomiting or purging are large and visible, while those in sweat are small and hard to see.

The forms of worms vary: some resemble infants, snakes, rats, loaches, eels, toads, tadpoles, mosquitoes, gnats, ants, lice, or other creatures; others appear as tangled silk, rotting floss, flesh balls, hair, horsehair, palm fiber, grass seeds, hemp, millet, fruit pits, essence-blood, glue, lacquer, rotting dough, or phlegm—countless shapes, impossible to describe fully. Examine them closely and burn them to prevent recurrence. If discarded outdoors, rain and dew may revive them. The worms, pressed by thunder and fire, may die if small, but larger ones survive—this has been observed in expelled worms.

The original method of pursuing worms relies on the three responses of sweating, vomiting, and purging. After years of practice, variations have emerged. Some patients sweat first from the feet, then the legs, followed by the buttocks, arms, flanks, and head, recovering in stages. Others, after twenty-one days of pursuit, show no response but nosebleeds; upon washing and examining the blood, worms as thick as shoelaces and over six inches long were found. Still others expelled centipedes from their ears, or worms the size of ants crawled from their beards and faces. Such strange phenomena are limitless. Without proper method, worms may flee.

When pursuing worms with talismans, proceed gradually—do not invoke the *Seven Ghosts* or impose deadlines for responses. Trust in the spirit-officers’ discretion. If the talismans are ingested too hastily, the worms may thrash and die within the consumed organs, worsening the damage and making restoration difficult. The patient may soon perish. A gradual approach allows thunder and fire to weaken the worms, preventing further feeding until they perish from exhaustion. The talismans in this tradition include restorative treatment, so by the time the worms descend, the damaged areas have already begun healing—delay is thus preferable. Premature expulsion leaves the viscera depleted and *original qi* weakened, making restoration difficult. Delay ensures the viscera remain firm and *original yang* intact, facilitating easy recovery. Other traditions prioritize swift responses, but many fail to recover.

In households where many have perished from this illness, the worms grow large and gain intelligence, able to move in and out of bodies, hide in walls, circulate *qi*, and spread toxins to infect others.

Moreover, the worms may exit the body of the afflicted and enter the body of one yet uninfected, roaming and feeding before returning to the sick. In critical cases where the five viscera are failing, the corpse-worms emerge one month—or even half a month—before the patient’s death, hence the saying: *"When the worms depart, the person perishes."* Some claim the worms must not be expelled, warning that their removal leads to death—this is a grave error. Others, observing the patient’s critical state, advocate first restoring then expelling, but this too is misguided. If the worms are not pursued and eradicated, they will fester within, consuming the flesh like maggots, spreading corruption—how then could the patient survive? After expelling the corpse-worms, restoration must begin at once, not delayed even a single day. One must obtain a pig’s leg bone. For coughing, add pig’s lung, simmer until tender, then mix in a little rice. Once cooked, cut fifteen strips of the restorative talisman into fine pieces and stir them into the broth, ensuring the paper does not clump. Take this at dawn each day, and after consuming it, do not return to sleep, for this is most harmful. Salt must not be added.

After consuming the talisman for four or five days, the abdomen settles, food becomes palatable, daily meals increase, and the symptoms gradually recede—even the critically ill may recover. If, however, the stomach rejects it, the abdomen swells, or diarrhea persists, or if one feels nauseous after eating, even a mild case may turn perilous. Strict dietary restrictions must be observed: pond fish, leavened bread, baked cakes, sesame cakes, beef, lamb, goose, sow pork, rapeseed oil, fried or roasted foods, cured meats, alcohol, raw or cold items, and all toxic substances must be avoided with utmost care. Daily meals should not be excessive, nor should one undertake long journeys, carry heavy loads, or strain the sinews and vessels, lest the injured areas suffer further damage and the illness relapse. Sexual abstinence is imperative, and one must maintain vigilance for a full year, allowing the injured flesh—both old and new—to knit together, so that movement and rest may proceed without hindrance. Even in mild cases, convalescence for half a year is essential to ensure lasting vitality and longevity.

**The Master’s Wondrous Application**
The Master draws upon the Northern qi to suffuse his body, transforming his spirit, forgetting form and severing thought. Closing his eyes, he inwardly visualizes the radiant light within his heart’s aperture. Then, directing the divine light of his right eye, he inscribes the Nine Characters before him. With both hands, he projects two Dipper stars forth, envisioning their starlight blazing brilliantly. The Master exhales his true qi, which shoots into the Dipper, emanating from the Nine Orifices to manifest the Seven Primordial Star Lords—hair unbound, swords in hand, vividly present upon the altar.

Thereafter, he recites the Tianpeng Incantation once, visualizing the true form of Tianpeng: four heads, eight arms, each wielding halberd, spear, halberd-sword, imperial bell, seal, fire lance, and fire rope; clad in a purple robe and golden armor, head adorned with the Xiaoyao Huayang turban, emerging within the Dipper. His countenance is wrathful, his might shakes heaven and earth, his entire body radiates the killing qi of thunder and fire.

The Master inhales qi to suffuse his body, declaring, “I am the Emperor.”

Next, he recites the Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation and the Tianpeng Incantation.

The Master forms the Living Luminary mudra with his left hand, gazing toward the northwest’s loftiest heights, and draws forth the purple-black golden light of the Supreme Mystery’s qi to spread before him. The Generals emerge from the killing qi. Upon completing the mudra, the true Dipper vanishes, leaving only the Generals manifest within the killing qi, ready for service.

Command them to lead their entire host of soldiers, follow the talisman’s decree, and station themselves to oversee the afflicted chamber, guarding the patient’s body, capturing and restraining corpse-worms and ghostly entities. Permit no escape, awaiting the order to pursue and strike. Furthermore, bid them work ceaselessly day and night to encircle and seize the ancestral kin of consumptive ghosts and vengeful dead, relentlessly executing them until all measures are fully enacted.

Once inscribed, recite the Tianpeng Incantation forward while brushing the talisman in the same direction; recite it backward while brushing in reverse. Draw the Supreme Mystery’s qi from behind the elbow into the brushstroke, then lift upward and seal with three sets of seven strokes.

**Snow Cliff’s Cloud:**
This talisman commands all Generals. Whenever fumigation reveals even the slightest trace, instruct the patient’s household to offer incense and lamps before the afflicted, lest the corpse-worms escape.

When inscribing talismans, first recite the Tianpeng Incantation, transforming the spirit into the Emperor. Recite the Tianpeng Incantation again, drawing the qi of thunder and fire. Invoke the Black Emperor of the North, infusing the Supreme Mystery’s qi. Then, channel the thunder-fire qi into the brush, envisioning the flame sword wreathed in blazing fire. The paper represents the patient—with blade and sword, slay the corpse-worms. Thereafter, summon true wrath to embody the killing and punitive force. If pursuing and striking, wait until stillness and calm prevail, embodying the power of generation.

**Qi-Unifying Commander-in-Chief Talisman**
Scorching Blood of the Fiery Emperor.

**Fourfold Clarity Shatters the Corpse**

With one stroke of the divine blade,
the myriad ghosts dissolve themselves.

**Heaven-Slaughter, Earth-Slaughter,**
**Year-Slaughter, Month-Slaughter, Day-Slaughter, Hour-Slaughter,**
**Calamity-Slaughter, Tribulation-Slaughter—**
all myriad ghosts, upon encountering this talisman, self-destruct.

**Left: Six Ding**
**Right: Six Jia**
Mao Gongwei, Tong Liyang, Li Shijin, Deng Xingwen,
Zhao Guangzhou, Gao Tianzhen, Gao Jiazhen.

After inscribing the names with the Tianpeng Incantation, draw in the Supreme Mystery’s qi. Then, gaze toward the Kun direction to summon the Commander-in-Chief. Next, inscribe *Li Zi Zhuang Xiang*, adding the primary and secondary slaughters.

**Reverently invoke the Heavenly Generals,**
descend directly into the afflicted’s body.
Slay the malevolent forces within so-and-so,
corpse-worms and ghostly entities—
pursue and strike them with clarity,
expel them from the body’s field,
manifesting distinct retribution.
Repair the inflicted harm,
regulate and harmonize qi and blood,
dispel the ailment of so-and-so,
swiftly bringing response.

If the afflicting ghost is as described above, then say:
**Reverently invoke the Heavenly Generals,**
seize and restrain the lineage of consumptive corpse-ghosts and kindred spirits,
enter the patient’s dreams to reveal their forms,
reporting the cause of the affliction with haste.

Add the **Three-Seven Seal**.
**Primary and Secondary Eight Generals Talisman.**

High Bozhen, Li Guozhen, Zhou Zhongda, Liu Biwen, Zheng Guangli, Xiong Shisheng, Zhang Xi, Liu Yi—
If treating *flying corpse*, use plain owl.
For *running influx*, use the great beast.
Add all talismans, recite the **Heavenly Penetrating Mantra**, and proceed as before.

**Five-Fire Talisman** (also called **Flame Emperor Talisman**)
Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, the True Fire of My Heart, the True Fire of the Great Yang, the Wandering True Fire of the Four Seasons and Five Thunders—
For each "fire" character, draw in the *qi* of thunder-fire, inhale through the *yin* and *wu* constellations, and exhale into the Five-Thunder Fire, directing it through the seven orifices into the talisman.
Then, with the eyes fixed on the *xun* direction, assist the fire’s eruption.

**Break through, shatter, sever the ghost’s head, snap the ghost’s limbs—**
chant without cease.
**Flame Emperor Mantra**, swiftly summon into the talisman.
Firmly visualize a ball of fire within the cinnabar field, with fierce blood inside.
With the brush’s intent, split open the cinnabar-field fireball to reveal the fierce blood, then stir it with the brush’s force, circulating it upward to the heart and out through the Heavenly Eye before you.
Draw the fierce blood back into the Central Palace, blend it, and stir again with the brush’s force, driving it up to the Mud-Pill Palace.
Sound the *tian* tone with the eyes, directing the generals thrice into the talisman.
Visualize the fierce blood within the raging fire, and in wrathful fury, draw in thunder-fire with a shout to reinforce it.
Chant seven revolutions of wrath, painting the mouth as you intone:
*First revolution: Heaven and Earth quake,*
*Second revolution: Sun and Moon darken,*
*Third revolution: The Dipper’s handle stirs,*
*Fourth revolution: Thunder-fire erupts,*
*Fifth revolution: Thunderclaps roar,*
*Sixth revolution: Corpse-ghosts perish,*
*Seventh revolution: Seize and restrain all rebels against Heaven, all lawless transmitters of consumptive corpse-disease and latent afflictions, all demonic essences.*
*Come beneath my talismanic command—*
*submit to death, motionless and inert.*

Dip the brush, assume wrathful posture, and subdue the corpse-worms.
Next, add the primary and secondary *xuan-qi*, summoning them in.
Alternatively, add the *sha*-subduing command for fumigation, reciting:
*Heaven subdues, Earth subdues,*
*Year subdues, Month subdues,*
*Day subdues, Hour subdues.*
**Reverently invoke the Heavenly Generals,**
descend directly with the talisman into so-and-so’s body,
pursue and subdue as instructed all contagions of consumptive transmission and toxic influx.
If the influx-*qi* lingers in the body,
request the Heavenly Generals to extract the worms and effluvia,
manifesting them clearly in the patient’s two hands
for evident treatment—
swiftly bring response.

After the incantation, add *zhuang-xuan* and infuse *qi*.
When, after pursuit and attack, the chest and heart grow hot,
this is *empty tide*—
use cinnabar to inscribe a talisman, dispelling the three *huo-qi* of fire.
Form the talisman into a pellet, mix with well-flower water and cinnabar,
face north, inhale the smoke of aloeswood, and swallow.

**Flame Emperor Mantra Inscription**
The master enters stillness, visualizing fierce blood within the cinnabar field,
circulating it to the heart, then to the Mud-Pill’s divine chamber, and projecting it forward.
Draw it back into the Central Palace, then inflate the *qi* with the Seven-Revolution Mantra, painting wrathfully.
Draw thunder-fire from the *xun* direction, and with the eyes, guide the fierce-blood generals and thunder-fire, exhaling with the brush’s force into the talisman.
Visualize all within the talisman as raging fire, then add the *sha*-subduing strokes:
paint outward in the *shun-peng* direction, inward in the *ni-peng* direction.
Flick the brush straight downward, chanting *Divine Blade*—one stroke—
and visualize the fire-sword’s fury.

To subdue corpse-worms, add *zhuang* to dispel cold.
Inscribe the fierce blood into the master’s name, chant the mantra,
and dispatch the marshal from the *xun* direction.
The master inhales the *qi* of thunder-fire from *xun*, seals it within, and fills to bursting.
With a flash of the eyes, lightning strikes—
then draw down the marshal’s single stroke into the talisman.
Form the mudra, paint with the Seven-Revolution Mantra, and circulate the thunder-fire brush-force.
Draw in *xun*-fire, then inscribe the two "subdue" characters—
omit the *sha* character.

For the third talisman, follow the Seven Ghosts’ method, infusing fierce blood.
Apply the inner fire to the two "subdue" characters,
visualizing the talisman’s thunder-fire surging forth to fill the patient’s chamber,
the fire-*qi* pressing upon all within.
When the body grows intensely hot,
the master directs his own *qi* to the point of dissolution, then shouts to halt and seal.

**Reviving Passage Talisman**
Exhale red light, circulating heart-fire downward.

Exhale black *qi*, circulating kidney-water upward to rise.
*Tai Shang* decrees: Mighty officers, silver fangs guard and uphold the true *qi*,
sweeping away baleful spirits—thunder-fire, celestial pivot, *xun*-triple *qi* exhaled within.

For the right talisman, use a single sheet of yellow paper, six rows and six columns.
Compose the spirit and settle the mind, sit suspended with legs spread,
left hand forming the *sha* mudra, right hand grinding ink.
Recite the Heavenly Vanguard Mantra, drawing in thunder-fire with the exhalation,
then the northern mantra to summon dark *qi*,
the Six Palaces Mantra to invoke *Feng*-*sha*,
the Golden Light Mantra to summon the pivot’s breath.
Five *qi* are called into the inkstone.
As before, sequentially gather *qi* to infuse the paper,
then gather *qi* to charge the brush.
Recite the Heavenly Vanguard Mantra again,
drawing *xun*-*qi* to exhale upon the brush-tip,
emanating a single streak of golden light—
as the light stirs and surges, begin writing.

Upon completion, as before, gather all *qi* to charge the brush and trace the central boundary once,
then gather all *qi* to charge the brush and trace the left and right boundaries twice.
Recite the incantation:
*Above it flows upward, below it streams downward—*
*where true* qi *arrives,*
*demonic essence perishes.*

Recite without fixed count, ensuring the brush-force is vigorous and unbroken,
the spirit’s radiance ever attending.
Thunder-fire, lightning’s glow, true *qi* congeals—
all blends and coalesces.

Xue Ya says: This talisman unblocks *qi* in men and regulates menstruation in women,
specifically treating disharmony of *qi* and blood,
obstructed menses,
yin-yang separation,
and cold-heat sores or toxins lodged beneath the skin.
After ingesting the talisman, true *qi* pursues and expels demonic *qi*—
if the abdomen rumbles like thunder, or in treating cold damage,
its efficacy is profound.

**Tonifying Talisman**
Exhale.

Exhale with *chui*, *xu*, *xi*, *hu*.
Recite the incantation:
*One, two, three, four, five—*
*Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.*
*Heart’s one, two, three, four, five—*
*qi* governs the myriad dharmas’ source.
Where water pains arise, swiftly gather and fill.
Exhale: *Lao Jun*, come to relieve suffering.

Metal stores the liver’s *hun*,
lungs store the *po*,
the heart stores *qi*,
kidneys store will,
the spleen stores intent.
May the celestial numinous nodes flourish,
granting long life’s preservation.
Of the Great Mystery’s One,
guard its true form.
The Five Viscera’s Spirit Lords,
each safeguard peace and tranquility.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!*

Once the *Metal Radiance Incantation* concludes,
the master half-opens the mouth,
tongue pressing the upper palate,
drawing the Five *qi*, Thunder-Fire, Metal Radiance, and *Gang qi* into the *Flower Pool*.
Close the mouth, await the nectar to fill the pool,
then grind the ink anew, reciting the prior incantation as before.
Again, guide the *qi* into the *Flower Pool*,
nurturing the true fluid,
swallowing the Jade Knack,
sending it into the Spirit Palace,
blending into the Great Void.
Within true mindfulness, a great general coalesces,
like an infant dwelling in the Spirit Palace.

Proceed to inscribe the talisman,
focusing intent upon the great general.
Prepare thin paper in the Five Phases’ five apertures,
inscribe the talisman’s first and second incantations,
concentrating intent within.
Gather and blend the Five *qi*,
harmonizing and overflowing,
exhale into each inscription in turn.

Once more, concentrate spirit,
hands forming the Sword Mudra,
holding the talisman before you,
lifting with intent,
visualizing the general’s entry with clarity.
Recite the prior incantation again,
drawing the Five *qi*, Metal Radiance, and Celestial *Gang*,
merging them within.
Exhale to secure the general,
radiance fusing, spirit gathering,
*qi* like rouge.
Draw *qi* once more, exhale into it,
directing your spirit’s radiance
to infuse and illuminate the talisman.

Pray thus:
*Reverently summon the Great General of Marrow-Filling and Essence-Replenishing,*
*the Five Viscera’s Mighty Deity of Benefit,*
*the Three Origins’ Five Virtues’ Direct Talisman General.*
*Divide the true, descend the qi,*
*swiftly enter the talisman!*

Upon concluding the prayer,
envision the general seated within the Golden Radiance Talisman.
The master then folds and divides it,
cutting finely for men or women,
placing it into the meat of the meal,
avoiding salt.
For deficiency, use ginseng and astragalus,
pounded to extract their natural juice.

Xue Ya says: Borrow the five grains and meat’s flavors
to lodge true *qi*’s supplementation.
After consumption, avoid sleep at all costs,
for sleep harms the spleen.
Best taken before dawn or at noon.
If all symptoms recede, this marks successful tonification—
even the perilous may stabilize.
If symptoms worsen, treatment is difficult.

**For Pain Connecting Back to Heart**
Recite the *Celestial Canopy Incantation*,
summon the Four-Eyed Elder,
drawing Mysterious *qi* to manifest the general,
wielding an iron brush to expel baleful *qi*,
directing *qi* to the brush for use.
Take a breath of the Great Marshal’s brush-tip *qi*,
infuse it into the talisman,
seizing the toxin within the void.
Then firmly declare:
*Reverently summon the Four-Eyed Elder, Marshal Li,*
*leading the Great Mystery’s Stern Execution Officers and Soldiers,*
*swiftly enter the talisman,*
*urgently halt the pain connecting back to the heart in the afflicted!*

The master again inhales the brush’s *qi*, exhales onto the brush,
shouting once to halt,
adding *Gang* and *Li* *qi*.
Hastily apply three to seven layers of Great Celestial *qi*.
This talisman is mixed with flour and applied to the painful area.

**Talisman for Ghostly Intercourse**
Inscribe the right talisman using the *Celestial Canopy Incantation*,
inverting the *Commander-in-Chief’s* endorsement:
*Summon the Celestial General to slay and subdue the lingering corpse,*
*severing demonic dreams.*
*Swiftly!*

For households where the husband seeks the deceased wife,
or the wife seeks the deceased husband,
resulting in mutual harm in dreams,
or for lingering corpse intercourse or lustful unions,
this talisman governs.
Affix it to the bed’s foot where it meets the ground.
For permanent severance, select a *Fu Duan* day,
notify the master to inscribe an iron talisman,
nailing it to the bed’s foot or doorframe.

**Talisman for Cough**
Inscribe using the *Celestial Canopy Incantation*.
With both hands, trace the Yin-Yang Dipper,
emerging from the body to unite the Dipper,
clearly visualized before you.
For heat-induced cough, add the *Commander-in-Chief*;
for cold-induced cough, add the Five Fires.
Add primary and secondary as needed.

Pray:
*Reverently summon the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins Star Lords,*
*the Seven Origins’ True Essences,*
*descend into the talisman,*
*swiftly enter the afflicted one’s body,*
*flowing into the Five Viscera.*
*Lung Metal flourishes,*
*all spirits find peace,*
*myriad ghosts vanish.*
*Swiftly!*

Envision the Dipper’s truth starkly present in the altar.
Inhale the Dipper’s *qi*, exhale into the talisman,
imagining yellow *qi* misty and vast,
drawing central *qi* to exhale.
Next, envision the West’s white *qi* misty and vast,
inhale through the nose, exhale into it.
Then imagine the North’s water *qi* misty and vast,
blow into it.

Next pray:
*Mysterious Heaven’s numinous power,*
*Dipper Constellation’s essence,*
*Primal August One’s decree,*
*Nine Stars descend!*
Upon concluding the incantation,
direct the gaze to merge the Seven Stars into one,
vast as a chariot wheel.
The master inhales through the nose, draws in the Golden Radiance Star’s *qi*,
exhales into the talisman.
Then inscribe *Peng* in alignment, reciting the incantation slowly while tracing;
for urgent reversal, trace in opposition.
Project your own *Gang* before you,
brush lightly.
With the left hand, press down the Thunder Formation,
swallow the *Flower Pool’s* fluid,
directing it to the Cinnabar Field below.
Await the body’s response as verification,
then add the seal.

**For Vomiting Blood**
Inscribe using the *Celestial Canopy Incantation*,
adding the Five Fires above.
Trace the Yin-Yang Dipper,
emerging from the body to unite the Dipper,
envisioning the Dipper’s stars distinctly.

Recite:
*Northern Dipper Star Lords,*
*Seven Origins’ True Essences,*
*descend into the talisman,*
*swiftly enter the afflicted one’s body,*
*flowing into the Five Viscera.*
*Liver Wood flourishes,*
*all spirits find peace,*
*myriad ghosts vanish.*
*Swiftly!*

Envision the Seven Origins starkly present,
the North’s water *qi* misty and vast,
drawing *qi* through the nose, inhaling, and blowing into the talisman.
Next imagine the East’s wood *qi* lush and dense,
inhaling through the nose,
firmly exhaling into the talisman.
Then draw in Fire *qi*,
envisioning their intermingling without dispersion.

Next recite:
*Mysterious Heaven’s numinous power,*
*Dipper Constellation’s essence,*
*Primal August One’s decree,*
*Nine Stars descend!*
Upon concluding the incantation,
direct the gaze to merge the Seven Stars into one,
a golden radiance coalescing.
Guide it into the talisman with the eyes,
adding left and right alignments,
pressing the Thunder Formation straight down to center,
without lifting the brush.
Swallow the *Flower Pool’s* fluid,
awaiting the body’s response,
then add the seal.

**For Stopping Diarrhea and Purging**
Recite the *Peng Incantation* while inscribing,
adding primary and secondary baleful *qi*.
Baleful *qi* follows *Peng*’s alignment,
moving from outer to inner,
shouting *halt, halt!*

Reverse the alignment to counter *Peng*,
moving from outer to inner,
press the brush and shout *halt, halt!*
For stopping vomiting:
perform thus—
inhale *qi*, swallow, and settle at center,
awaiting the body’s response.
For stopping diarrhea:
perform thus—
draw in *qi*, seal the body’s ghostly gate,
settling at center before adding the seal.

**For Stopping Tidal Fever**
First add the primary and secondary seals,
then append baleful *qi*—*Mysterious Baleful*, *Ram Baleful*, *Dhāraṇī Baleful*—
envisioning the three *qi* within the talisman,
cold and pressing, undispersed.
Inscribe the Northern incantation with two alignments:
outer to inner, then inner to outer,
again from outer to inner,
brushing straight down.
With the Thunder Formation, drive out the fever *qi*,
expelling it from below.
Apply the third talisman without lifting the brush,
envisioning the baleful *qi* cold and pressing,
congealing within the talisman,
pervading the entire chamber.
The master directs their own skill,
sensing the response,
holding the brush at center,
then adding the command for ingestion.

**Dispelling Tidal Fever**
On the right, use the *Heavenly Peng* incantation,
inscribing the *Commander* inverted above.
With both hands, trace the Four Seats of the Yin-Yang Dipper.
Recite:
*Essence of Supreme Yin,*
*formed of Metal and Water.*
*Hear my summons,*
*swiftly enter the talisman.*
The master exhales a golden radiance,
a bridge suspended in the void.
Envision within the Dipper the two envoys—
*Ram* and *Dhāraṇī*—
appearing as comely women,
their bodies enveloped in black *qi*,
descending beneath the golden bridge.
The master inhales the *qi* of the two envoys and blows it in,
then draws in three breaths of *qi* into the talisman,
until the teeth grow cold.
After the two alignments, inscribe:
*Summon the Heavenly Generals to swiftly dispel*
*the tidal fever from the afflicted body.*

If the five centers are vexed, swallow with cinnabar-infused cold water, then inhale the smoke of aloeswood incense and swallow facing north.

**Boiling Ghosts**
When boiling ghosts, first summon the Commander to lead the five boiling-ghost generals to the altar. Once the Commander’s name is inscribed, invert the feet upward. Within, write: *Five Thunders, General Summons to Slay Corpse Ghosts, Dragon Dawn*. Follow the Five Fire Talisman to conclude. Fashion a paper twist, and with a single breath, ignite it from the talisman’s foot.

First light it beneath the afflicted one’s bed, then add it to the Earth God’s hall, and again to the Household Deities’ shrine. Have someone listen for the report of its crackling. If the scent of burning bone arises, it signals ancestral ghosts, female ghosts drawn by blood, ghosts of childbirth, or those transmitting corpse contagion through roasted flesh. Other malign influences include wine and vinegar vapors, sulfur and orpiment fumes, flames of grievance, ancient essence of lotus fragrance, the stench of Buddhist and Daoist bronze and iron, the reek of blades and beasts, the grassy breath of maternal uncles and aunts, the foulness of various *xiao*-spirits, or the consumptive miasma of neighbors. If these manifest in the patient’s dreams or sleep-talk, someone must listen for the response and proceed as deemed fit.

**Seven Ghosts, Four Illuminations, Shattering the Bones**
When inscribing this talisman, invoke the master to commence pursuit and summon the generals with clear intent. Infuse three breaths of *qi* into brush and ink, then inscribe with focused visualization.

On the right, use the *Heavenly Peng* incantation to write the talisman. For the Nine Slayings, write the Slaying with *ding* on the left and *jia* on the right. The master visualizes a fireball in the cinnabar field, imagining the brush as a fire sword. With one stroke, the fireball splits open, and the marshal appears. The master seals firmly, drawing the *qi* from the Ninefold Mud Pill into the body. With a single opening of the eyes, thunder and lightning swirl, and fire erupts from the talisman. Envision the stars’ radiance distinctly.

Recite:
*Reverently invite the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Seven Thousand Divine Generals, to descend into the talisman and slay the corpse ghosts. Swiftly compel their manifestation.*

Visualize the Dipper’s Perfected Ones, hair unbound and swords in hand, entering the talisman’s locus. Mobilize the Five Thunders into the intermediate realm, drawing the *qi* of the Central Heaven into the Mysterious Pass. Blow it toward the northwest’s highest point, envisioning the Purple Tenuity Emperor Star vast as a cartwheel, its light illuminating the earth. With both hands, trace the Northern Emperor’s command to slay and compel, and the *Kuigang*’s rousing decree to slay and compel the two Dippers. Shatter the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, and suddenly behold the Northern Emperor above, mounted on a crimson-maned white horse, attended by the Four Saints. Draw in the star *qi*.

Recite:
*Your servant reverently summons the Northern Culmen’s Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity, whose imperial carriage enters the talisman to personally lead the slaying and subjugation.*

The master concentrates the spirit, guiding the Emperor into the talisman with the gaze.

**Mysterious Void Incantation**
Reverently invite Marshal Heavenly Peng, Marshal Heavenly You, Marshal Winged Saint, and Marshal Protector Saint to lead their troops into the talisman. Visualize the Four Saints and their armies from the four directions entering the talisman. Then inscribe the Dipper among the Four Saints, with *Breaking Army* pointing *Gen* to shoot the Ghost Gate.

The Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity commands the Three Origins and the Three Officials’ Great Emperors to lead their troops into the talisman to slay and subjugate the corpse ghosts. Visualize the Three Officials entering.

The Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity commands the Great Emperor of Fengdu to lead his troops into the talisman to slay. Visualize their entry from the north.

The Six Cavern Chiefs and Kings, Spirits of Consumption Pursuit, receive the Emperor’s command to lead their troops in slaying. Envision them arriving from the *Gen* direction, wielding wolf-tooth clubs.

The Three Officials’ Great Emperors decree slaying and compulsion. The Great Emperor of Fengdu decrees slaying and compulsion. The Six Cavern Chiefs and Kings behead and compel. Recite the Northern Incantation, rise, and perform the inner *qi* technique with three breaths. Then, in sequence and reverse, draw *Peng* into left and right to compel and expel anger, applying it with the brush.

**Three Sovereigns’ Sealing Dispatch**
When inscribing this talisman, one must embody great wrath to manifest Heaven’s majesty and enable slaying and subjugation. Never employ it lightly, nor profane the Emperor. For it possesses the power to revive the dead—how could it respond without true sincerity and true wrath?

**Volume Forty-Six of *Pearls from the Ocean of Dharma*: *The Purple Imperial Mysterious Writ***

**Sequence of Posthumous Ritual Execution**

For households afflicted by consumption where the sick cannot rise, the talisman is to be inscribed on catalpa wood, six *cun* in length—adding half a *cun* in leap years—one and a half *cun* in width. Present the petition to the master on an *shen* day, then offer sacrifices and provisions to the deceased. The talisman is held by the bereaved—men on the left, women on the right—before burning the petition in each chamber.

Upon completion of the ritual, proceed to the place where the coffin rests. Calm the mind and concentrate the spirit, then trace a well within the coffin, envisioning it as a withered pit. Invoke the marshals to seize and confine the flying corpse, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, curses, and affliction-*qi* into the well.

Recite the seven-turn incantation, strike with the Thunder Formation, and drive them in with the Thunder-Fire Mantra. Then seal the coffin.

Thereafter, select an auspicious day to perform the posthumous severance according to the method.

The Patriarchs have sworn: to employ this method lightly is to invite calamity upon oneself. One must approach the altar with utmost reverence before proceeding. Only through perfect sincerity can resonance be achieved. Strictly adhere to these precepts; do not treat them as mere common text.

**Summoning and Assembly**

The master draws the *qi* of the Central Heaven, enters the central [aperture] to stir it, and exhales toward the extreme northwest heights. He envisions the Purple Tenuity Emperor Star, vast as a chariot wheel, its light illuminating the earth, and parts his hands. The Northern Emperor issues his command to restrain and seize. The *Kui*-*Gang* roars into motion, enforcing the seizure. The *Zi-Wu* Dipper and the Second Dipper clash open the stellar enclosure; the master perceives the Great Emperor within. He inhales *qi* to suffuse his body, declaring, "I am the Northern Culmen," and summons at once.

"Fiery Emperor’s scorching blood, the Four Luminaries shatter the corpse; Heavenly Strategist annihilates the kind. With one stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter in rout."

Solemnly he summons the Fiery Emperor’s Scorching Blood Envoys: "Hasten to the altar at my command." The summons complete, the master faces south. He circulates kidney-water upward to strike the heart-fire, and the envoys ascend the twin passes of the spine, traverse the twelve-storied tower, and emerge from the spirit chamber, merging with the southern quadrant into one. They manifest instantly in *Li*. The master unites with primordial *qi*, and with his gaze directs the characters "one," "three," and "seven" upon the left-hand Jade Seal—golden light is the Dao.

Once the Scorching Blood Generals have arrived at the altar, he raises the imperial decree and commands them to proceed directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, summoning Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all their subordinate officers and generals. "Hasten to the altar at my command."

The summons complete, the master wields his sword-finger to sever, bestowing upon the great marshals the breath of command. They ascend directly to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The master grasps the Purple Tenuity Enclosure Seal and recites the Black Emperor’s incantation of the North:

"Northern Black Emperor, supreme among the myriad sages.
Great Tenuity’s Six *Jia*, the Five *Qi* Spirit Lords.
Radiance surpassing sun and moon, might encompassing heaven and earth.
Flying talismans seize the registers, severing the gates of ghosts.
Marching spirits deploy *qi*, dispelling the Five Pestilences.
Left and right officers and soldiers, the Three and Five Generals.
Thunder Lords and thunderbolts, lightning flashing through racing clouds.
Blades like rain, ranks like clouds.
Holding the imperial chime, crowned with Kunlun.
Patrolling the world, hunting demonic essences.
The Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces, the blood-feeding guests—
none dare resist.
Should any dare to spread their scales,
the Star of Stability binds their hands,
the Northern Emperor seizes their souls,
the Three Terraces and Seven Stars wield swords to sever their bodies.
Crimes shall not be lightly punished; calamity shall befall yourselves.
Demonic essences and *wangliang*—let not your ears hear.
Whoever hears my incantation shall have their heads shattered, brains split,
scattered like fine dust."

Solemnly he summons Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all officers and generals of the Heavenly Pen Inner Court. "Hasten to the altar at my command." The master extends the Purple Tenuity Seal with his left hand, raises the golden light, and guides the gaze of the generals, clearly manifesting them within the altar from the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, ready to be dispatched at will.

This posthumous-severing jade talisman is inscribed while reciting the Heavenly Pen Mantra. Upon completion, it is infused into the *Du-Tong* over the corpse-killing ghost. Before the third seven-day period, the principal and secondary talismans are applied to the demonic essence. Using the Northern Black Mantra, the names of the five generals are inscribed upon the *Du-Tong*, infused with primordial *qi* and sealed with three seven-fold presses. As commonly employed, this ensures total subjugation, swiftly extinguishing corpse-demons and demonic essences.

Next, he mobilizes thunder:
"Reverently I invoke the Heavenly Thunder, the Heavenly Emperor Shi;
the *Qian* Earth Thunder shakes the earth to the heavens.
*Kun*’s left harbors the Poisonous Thunder, ever shining;
its right holds the Poisonous Thunder, flashing with lightning.
Spring thunder constantly strikes flying sky-demons;
summer thunder strikes earthly evil to annihilation.
Autumn thunder flashes, racing through the clouds;
winter thunder strikes ten thousand evils to extinction.
The halting thunder, the great tree without shelter—
may it ever protect the myriad people and descend auspiciousness.
*Om du-liu, da du-liu, fei du-liu*, restrain and seize!"

With the left formation, he turns once beneath the left flank—heaven and earth quake.
The second turn darkens sun and moon.
The third turn at *Xun* stirs the *Kui*-*Gang*.
The fourth turn at *Li* ignites thunder-fire.
The fifth turn at the center shakes with thunderbolts.
The sixth turn at *Kun* crushes the malevolent.
The seventh turn at *Gen* captures and seizes those who defy heaven and lack the Dao—
consumptive transmission, hidden contagion, all demonic essences.
Swiftly they submit beneath my Five Thunder *Kui*-*Gang*,
bound to die, motionless and inert.

With the right formation, he visualizes beneath the waist: the two hands as the Direct Thunder Envoys, the two kidneys as the Thunder-Climbing Prefecture, the lower abdomen as the Penglai Capital Water Bureau, the heart as the Thunderclap Capital Bureau, the twenty-four vertebrae as the Halting Thunder Great Tree. He stabilizes the two formations, rising from the lower abdomen to the heart, then back to the abdomen, channeling directly from the flanks to the ears as the Thunder Cavern. With one strike, the talisman is infused, envisioning heaven and earth overturned, drawing *qi* into the center through the dual formations.

Next, he recites the Five Fire Mantra:
"Heavenly Fire, Earthly Fire,
Yang Fire, Yin Fire,
the true fire of my heart,
the true fire of the Great Yang,
the Five Thunders of the Four Seasons,
the roaming true fire.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*"

The incantation complete, the master hooks his little fingers together, pulling from *Yin* to *Wu* to ignite. He envisions raging flames scorching heaven and earth, annihilating demonic essences. Those who witness it are driven ten thousand fathoms into the earth. With three stomps of the left foot, he envisions the gods and demons seized beneath ten thousand hounds.

Solemnly he summons the Great General of the Primordial Unity, Commander of the Supreme August Prefecture, along with Marshal Xiong, the Great General of Consumptive Pursuit; Marshal Liu, the Great General of Affliction-Severing; Marshal Zhou, the Great General of Deafening Troops; Marshal Li, the Great General of the Mute; Marshal Zhao, the Great General of the Furrowed Brow; and all their subordinate officers and generals. "Follow the talisman’s command, station yourselves here, and single-mindedly exterminate consumptive transmission, flying corpses, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, and seize affliction-toxins and affliction-*qi*. Protect the household and kin, severing the source of calamity forever."

"Great Marshals, lead your troops into the talisman and station yourselves here."

Next, he invokes the Heavenly August Thunder Sovereign:
"Heavenly August’s decree commands—
all generals hasten to attend.
Who dares disobey shall have their heads struck off, their roots destroyed.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*"

Calming his spirit, he envisions the Heavenly August Emperor manifesting in the Southern Palace. His tongue presses against his upper palate as he inscribes the talisman, his brush and gaze uniting as one. His gaze welcomes the Great Emperor into the talisman.

Next, he inscribes the character *ni* (聻), sealing off all subsequent generals by sweeping his brush from the right forehead across to the left. The upper stroke severs flying corpses; the middle, human transmission; the lower, wandering consumptive *qi*—his left foot crossing over *gen* to halt it.

Then he recites the Golden Light Mantra once, envisioning all generals enveloped within its radiance. Golden *qi* spreads above, resplendent with golden light.

Next, he visualizes the heavens darkening and the earth blackening, holding his breath to observe the karmic retribution. Transforming his spirit into the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, he draws the Great Heavenly Northern *qi* to suffuse his body, then inscribes the □ character within.

Following this, he intones the *Xu Xuanyu* Mantra, summoning Tianpeng, Tianyu, Yisheng, and Yousheng to lead their troops into the talisman, eroding and consuming it. He then envisions the Four Saints arriving from the four directions to enter the talisman.

Next, he recites the Tianpeng Mantra, solemnly invoking:
The Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Tianpeng Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the east.

Then the Tianyu Mantra, solemnly invoking:
The Primordial Radiance Cinnabar Heavenly Prefecture’s Tianyu Supreme Emperor, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the south.

Then the Yisheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:
The Primordial Illumination Purple Void Prefecture’s Yisheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the west.

Then the Yousheng Mantra, solemnly invoking:
The Primordial Harmony Relocation Prefecture’s Yousheng Perfected Lord, with three hundred thousand troops, entering the talisman from the north.

Next, he envisions all generals within the talisman, enveloped in the *qi* of slaughter. After serving the Thunder Rites, no fire is used—only the inscription of the Heavenly August Emperor’s seal and the Golden Light Mantra. He visualizes the generals within, then inscribes the Four Saints’ summons to enter, drawing upon the Great Heavenly Slaughter *qi* for efficacy, and seals it with □.

For nocturnal operations, the sequence is as follows:
Initiate the sacred rites, summon the generals, offer sacrifices to dispatch them, conduct thorough searches, perform the *xinggai* ritual, assemble and ascend the altar, send off the deceased, and conclude.

Upon ascending the altar, prepare black water and seal the five cosmic locks of Heaven and Earth.

The master concentrates his spirit in silent prayer:
"Rosy light illumines golden hues,
I gaze in reverence at the master’s majestic form.
Slaughter-*qi* congeals like frost,
From afar, I behold the marshal’s solemn might."

The disciple of the lineage, [Name], prostrates and offers incense, respectfully invoking:
The Heavenly Teaching Master, Lord of Humanity and Devas, the Manifestly Efficacious and Divinely Responsive Protector of the Realm Perfected Lord;
The Wondrous Dao Teaching Master, the Right-Assisting and Wondrously Efficacious, Thoroughly Responsive Great Void Perfected Lord;
The Sincere Teaching Master, the Manifestly Assisting and Karmically Responsive, Wondrously Distant Perfected Lord.

"With utmost reverence, I beseech the sagely master to witness and illuminate. Today, on behalf of [Name], I establish the Supreme Black Prison of Grievances. I humbly implore the sagely master to preside over the altar, uphold the teachings, empower the talismans, and guide the household’s unrepentant, unenlightened karmic ghosts and vengeful spirits into the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, that they may be bound and eradicated. I earnestly pray for the sagely master’s manifest response."

Summoning the Generals:
The master draws the Golden Light *qi*, exhaling it into the prison, envisioning it as the Golden Towers and Jade Chambers, adorned with rare treasures, exotic flowers, and sumptuous delicacies, all arrayed in perfect clarity. The sagely master stands at the forefront to receive them, then summons Zhe’e:

"By the decree of the Northern Bureau,
Wind and fire shall not cease.
Zhe’e Great General,
Swiftly reveal your true form!"

Issuing the command, he summons the great generals to descend from the northwest, guard the prison, and await further summons.

"The Heavenly August Emperor’s decree descends,
The Northern Emperor takes command.
Above, summon the Thunder Department;
Below, summon the mountain, marsh, and local deities of the sacrificial register.
Hasten to obey the imperial edict,
Array the troops in formation.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*"

In silence, he envisions the thunder deities and sacrificial register spirits stationed on all sides for protection. He instructs trusted attendants to maintain vigilant guard, ensuring no movement.

Then, entering each chamber, he presents the catalpa-wood talismans, proclaims the official documents, and burns them. Executing the Fire Wheel Mudra, he envisions a raging inferno scorching the heavens and slaughtering the earth. Stamping his foot thrice, he sees the malevolent consumptive ghosts and *zha* spirits seized and cast ten thousand fathoms into the earth.

Next, he employs the Heavenly Thunder and Heavenly Emperor’s Release, arranging the formation to mobilize thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth to gather *qi*.

Then he recites:
"The Dao of Heaven severs,
The Dao of Earth at *hai* severs.
The human Dao at *xun* flourishes,
The ghost Dao at *kun* severs.
*Gen* severs all transmission of consumptive ghosts forever,
A thousand years shall they not meet,
Ten thousand ages shall they not encounter.
My talisman severs once,
All ghosts are eternally eradicated at the root."

Again, he mobilizes thunder, overturning Heaven and Earth. Holding his breath, he seals the Nine Orifices with his left hand covering his face like Mount Tai, his right sleeve concealing them, preventing any *qi* from escaping. The Yellow River flows backward as he observes the *qi*’s karmic response.

Next, he solemnly invokes:
The Primordial Responding Great August Prefecture’s Unified *Qi* Commander-in-Chief;
The Consumptive-Pursuing Great General, Marshal Xiong;
The Consumptive-Severing Great General, Marshal Liu;
The Deafening Troops Great General, Marshal Zhou;
The Mute General, Marshal Li;
The Zhe’e Great General, Marshal Zhao;
And all attending officials and generals.

"Today, lead your troops into the talisman and station yourselves here, dedicated to exterminating consumptive transmission, flying corpses, corpse-worms, ghostly entities, and seizing affliction-toxins and affliction-*qi*. Protect the household and kin, severing the source of calamity forever. Rely upon your divine might to enforce these prohibitions."

The master proceeds through each chamber, performing the rites accordingly. He envisions each chamber’s light penetrating the altar, the entire space engulfed in thunder and fire, driving the corpse-ghosts to flee into the Jade Chambers.

As the master performs the rites, he exhales three mouthfuls of slaughter-*qi* onto the altar, envisioning the *qi* of Heaven and Earth coalescing in slaughter. The altar transforms into the Northern Culmen Demon-Subduing Heavenly Palace, the Jade Chambers into the Northern Prison. The master becomes the Great Emperor, exhaling the mudra to dispatch the generals and seize the spirits.

Employing the Urgent Net-Forming Mudra, he traces from *gen* into the prison, beseeching the heavenly generals to apprehend the ghosts and imprison them. Casting the divination blocks to deploy the net, he seizes them one by one. If any remain unseized, he secretly dispatches the Consumptive-Severing Great General to pursue them.

Now, he proclaims aloud:
"By imperial decree, the supervisory marsh officials are jointly commanded to ensure the capture of the household of [Name], who have defied Heaven and Earth, disobeyed the imperial decree, and harbored the vengeful ghosts of consumptive ancestors and karmic spirits. Seize them and imprison them, that their transgressions may be manifestly revealed and requited."

Upon completing the incantation and obtaining the divination blocks, he employs the Dipper Ladle and *guan* ritual implements, concluding with the slaughter-sealing and decapitation-sealing rites.

The altar’s light vanishes. With the **Arcuate Seven-Circuit Incantation**, he binds them with rope, pressing them down with the **Tai Mountain Seal** in his left hand, then commands: *"See the **Yá’é** Ridge fly, sealing the prison!"*

He solemnly invokes the **Elemental Sovereign of the Original Response**, the **Grand Marshal of the One-Qi Commandery**, **Bear the Great General** leading the **Pursuing Consumption Army**, and **Liu the Great General** leading the **Severing Consumption Army**, along with all subordinate officers and generals, to swiftly seize the household of [Name], whose **consumptive, vengeful, and karmic ghosts** now wreak havoc. They are to be **conveyed to the Supreme Black Prison of Judgment**, where they shall be **forever confined**.

Now, O Great Marshal, **hasten and arrest them immediately!**

After the incantation, he commands: *"The Patriarch oversees the altar. Officials and soldiers encircle, then draw the **Five-Seal Well of Heaven and Earth**."*

**Ziwen**, the **Northern Qi**, and the **Black Waters** enter within. The **Scattered Incantation** is chanted universally—all generals, heed the order!

Again, the **Fire Incantation** is chanted universally, envisioning **flaming fires raging through heaven and earth**. The **Reverse Scattered Incantation** follows, imagining **swords and spears clashing above and below**. He commands the celestial generals to **subdue and imprison the malevolent forces within the Supreme Black Prison**, where they shall **perish and be annihilated**.

After descending the altar, he raises the **Sword Seal** with both hands, holding up the **talisman-decree**, envisioning the Patriarch in the sky, dispatching generals to **guard the Ghostly Gate**.

He solemnly invokes the **Elemental Sovereign of the Original Response**, commanding the **One-Qi Commandery’s Grand Marshal** and the **Hundred Million Subordinate Officers, Generals, Soldiers, and Officials** to descend. Wherever this talisman is cast, they shall encircle it **threefold**, **solemnly seizing and binding** the **flying transmission corpses**, **wandering cadaverous insects**, **vengeful ghosts**, **consumptive qi**, **karmic spirits**, and **malevolent spectral forces**, delivering them beneath the talisman’s decree to **perish and be annihilated**.

Next, he affixes a talisman to the left ankle, just outside the external malleolus, then leads them into the **Well Altar**, sealing it with earth. He declares:

*"The Heavenly Way is sealed. The Earthly Way is sealed. The Human Way is open. The Ghostly Way is sealed."*

Then he strikes the axe, proclaiming:

*"The Heavenly Way is severed. The Earthly Way is severed. The Human Way is open. The Ghostly Way is severed. All flying transmission corpses, wandering cadaverous insects, and consumptive ghosts are **forever severed**.*

*For ten thousand years, they shall not meet. For a hundred thousand years, they shall not encounter.*

*This talisman now severs—all ghosts are **rootedly exterminated**.*

*Heaven’s annihilation seizes. Earth’s annihilation seizes. Annihilation seizes, seizing annihilation. Seizing annihilation, annihilation seizes. Heaven and Earth’s annihilation seizes, seizing annihilation of heaven and earth. Heaven’s collapse and Earth’s ruin seize annihilation, seizing ruin and collapse of heaven and earth."*

The Master takes **three steps in the Ding-Gang formation**, applying the **Great Heavenly Killing Energy** to his body, declaring, *"I am the Emperor."*

Facing east, he chants the **Mystic Void Incantation**, solemnly invoking **Heaven-Encounter the Grand Marshal**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.

When the Marshal arrives, he turns south, chanting the **Mystic Void Incantation**, solemnly invoking **Heaven-You the Grand Marshal**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.

When the Marshal arrives, he turns west, solemnly invoking **Yìshèng the True Lord**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.

When the Lord arrives, he turns north, solemnly invoking **Yòushèng the True Lord**, commanding him to **hasten to my presence** for orders.

Facing east again, he recites the **Heaven-Peng Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Original Response Imperial Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.

Next, he recites the **Heaven-You Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Jǐng Dan-Tian Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.

Next, he recites the **Northern Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Zhào Purple Void Palace**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.

Finally, he recites the **Yòushèng Incantation**, solemnly summoning **thirty thousand soldiers of the Yuan-Hé Relocation Academy**, commanding them to **hasten to my presence**.

As he reaches the **collapsing peaks**, he envisions **heaven and earth trembling**, soldiers gathering like clouds, **ten thousand armies massing**, filling half the realm. He draws the **highest qi from the northwest**, aligning his gaze with the **Lù character**, wielding the **Sword Seal** to **carve and execute**, commanding the generals and officials to **slaughter the city and sever the land**. The Master then **triggers the mechanism**, flips the **Zhuzi**, and falls backward, striking the axe **three times**, chanting:

*"Consumption severed, ghosts annihilated. Deep grudges dissolved in darkness.*

*With one glance, heaven collapses and earth splits."*

The incantation ends—**heaven overturns, earth inverts**. There is **neither thing nor self, neither ghost nor god**. All is **chaotic and formless**, **void and still**. At the moment the chant begins, **heaven and earth divide anew**, the **Two Principles separate**, and only the **Three True Saints** shine above in **golden radiance**, illuminating the **eight extremes**.

Residing within the **great crimson golden light**, he rises, **sacrifices to the Thunder**, and **thanks the Patriarch** before departing.

**The Mixed Master** first **calms his mind and concentrates**, inscribing the **three golden Shàngluó characters** on his chest with his gaze. He recites the **Proclamation in three reverences**, and though the golden characters vanish, he sees **three Immortals**.

He recites the **Proclamation of the Three Immortals**:

*"The High Holy Void Emperor of the Jade Purity,
The Supreme True Mixed-Origin Immortal Master,
