**Scroll One**

**1. The Supreme Primordial Azure**
The Supreme Ultimate is without peer; the Great Net begins in azure.
Within it dwells the Perfected, neither dying nor living.
The Most Honored in Heaven is called the Three Clarities.
In the Jade Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning.
In the Highest Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure.
In the Grand Clarity Palace resides the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue.
These are the Three Radiant Ones, each with their Perfected.
They have their stewards and ministers, left and right chancellors.
Jade lads and jade maidens, keepers of scriptures and scribes,
Scholars of the registers, who explicate texts and transcribe records.
Law officials and censors, with the central minister overseeing all.
The Lord who governs the cosmos is the Jade Emperor.
He receives the mandate of the Three Clarities and inspects the Purple Tenuity Court.
The attending officials receive the decrees of the Three Clarities.
The Purple Tenuity Court is the pivot of the hundred spirits.
Minor matters are handled directly; major affairs are reported upward.
The Jade Emperor’s palace establishes the regulations.
The attending ministers correspond above to the Three Clarities.
Beyond these, there are further ranks, each with its name.
The Northern and Southern Dippers are the Lords of Life and Death.
To the left is the Grand Tenuity, to the right the Lesser Tenuity Lord.
The Dark Capital governs judgments, the Celestial Pivot maintains the records.
The seventy-four bureaus are the officials of speech and tongue.
The general recorders and clerks investigate and discern the good.
This is called the Assembly Bureau, the Five Ministries of the Shangshu.
The Grand Tenuity, Lesser Tenuity, and Dark Capital governors—
These are the Three Departments, the Six Offices.
The altar adjudicators are likewise numbered.
Knowing their names and ranks can lead to awakening.
Those who cultivate our Dao may correspond to these ranks,
Attending the Jade Emperor’s court with the Three-Five Flying Steps.

**2. The Celestial Offices in Array**
The Great Dao governs all, the celestial offices arrayed in majesty.
The stars of the celestial offices pay homage to the Emperor’s realm.
Those who cultivate our Dao ascend to the Jade Emperor.
Their ranks and stations thus transcend the mundane and depart from the ordinary.
Some hold civil ranks, others military offices,
Standing in the left and right courts, adorned with golden pendants and pearl ornaments.
They attend the Jade Emperor’s chariot, serve beside the Purple Tenuity.
Some oversee celestial bureaus as ministers of the various heavens,
Officials of the Left Sun and Right Moon, functionaries of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.
All are named Perfected, able to tread the flowing net.
The yellow, white, and black paths—one must grasp their mechanism.
Those who know our Dao may ascend clouds with ease.
What is the Golden Duke? What is the Wooden Consort?
Cultivating the real and refining qi, one attains the subtle and profound.
Resplendent in filial piety and fraternal duty, unwavering in loyalty and righteousness—
Even without the great elixir, one may still awaken.
Those with dharma-names ranked among the lofty, or who practice talismans, incantations, and healing waters to save the imperiled, are of the lower grade.
Yet none compare to those who, through filial piety, refine qi,
Serve both parents, nurture the body,
Avoid corpse-liberation, and ascend to the real—
This is the filial path of refinement, which arrays them among the celestial beings.
The celestial path is not difficult; people make it so themselves.
Attaining immortality is not difficult—
One must not endanger the body or offend the parents,
Thus benefiting others through goodness.
Those who neither cultivate themselves nor serve their parents
Are like the poor who crave gold.
The array of celestial offices neither easily nor arduously records names.
Neither easy nor difficult—this is the essence of the supreme Dao.
As for those who seek spirits through ritual audience,
This is not easily understood, yet all arise from refining the form.

**3. The True Grades of Entering the Dao**
At the beginning of human life, the body is inherited from the parents.
Know what to nurture, know what to honor.
Know what to serve: the bodies of parents are the bodies of Celestial Worthies.
Those who serve their parents invite the descent of the Celestial Worthies’ numen.
To worship the stars, one must first honor siblings—
The bodies of siblings are the Perfected of the various heavens.
Those who understand this may burn cinnabar talismans,
And a hundred ghosts will fear their names.
Those who do not understand this cannot enter the Dao to serve the Three Clarities;
Yakshas will devour their flesh, demons will slaughter their spirits.
Even with ten thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures, they cannot ascend to the real.
With ten thousand boxes of talismans, they cannot command ghosts and spirits.
A hundred demons and ten thousand monsters, all manner of spirits,
Will laugh and seek to devour them.
When they die, Fengdu will examine and punish them,
Subjecting them to a hundred mutilations and a thousand tortures, again and again.
How could their souls become immortals in the Southern Palace?
The Perfected loathe to hear their names,
Covering their noses and stopping their ears, gnashing their teeth in refusal.

Only those who understand loyalty and filial piety may study the Dao—this Way is easily known and not difficult to practice. To repent and awaken to the Dao is the highest goodness. To transform unfilial conduct into filial piety is to fulfill perfect filiality. Perfect filiality is not difficult: correct your errors as soon as they occur. If you once offended your parents, dare not offend them again. From this day forward, swear never to repeat such transgressions. Thus will the Celestial Emperor dispatch Perfected Ones to descend into the world, bestowing upon you the true oral instructions. Cultivate yourself and aid others, accumulating merit to become an immortal.

Those who fail to awaken are like those who seek to cross a river without a raft—forever trapped in the wheel of rebirth, sinking into the realm of lesser ghosts.

**Chapter Four: Entering the Dao and Cultivating the Self**

The Dao is utterly level, never inherently difficult. Yet delusion over right and wrong creates barriers, severing one from the great stream. Here lies the sequence for entering the Dao, the gateway to abandoning the mundane. There are cases where parents ascend together, husband and wife stand side by side. Anxious for their well-being, they practice filial piety, which is the essence of loyalty. This loyalty is rooted in the nature of the self, as steadfast as mountains. Yet ordinary people waver and falter, thus falling into peril. They treat the nurturing of qi lightly and neglect serving their parents. Their primordial qi dissipates, the great debt of gratitude fades away—how then can they serve their sovereign or fulfill the Emperor’s will? Thus their sins accumulate like the rivers, and the underworld officials will examine and punish them.

All you children of the Red Dust, heed my words. If I deceive you, may my eyes go blind, my ears deaf, my nose blocked, my mouth mute, my limbs paralyzed. May I never tread the Celestial Court or ascend upon the clouds. For billions of kalpas, may Fengdu subject me to its torments. But I pray that you, my children of the Red Dust, keep filial piety ever in your hearts. At home, serve your parents; in court, be loyal to your lord. Do not indulge in greed or lust, nor waste your essence. Then blessings from the gods will flow to you like a spring, naturally and ceaselessly.

Recite this scripture day and night, and your soul and qi will naturally become numinous. If any among your kin suffer from illness or misfortune, it will naturally be resolved. If you dedicate this to wandering souls or stagnant spirits, they will escape the darkness of the underworld. With every recitation, the power of the Heavenly Worthy aids you. The Heavenly Worthy saves the people of the world, yet they remain ignorant of the principles of life. The Five Rebellions reside in their hearts, and when the Heavenly Worthy sees this, tears stream down like rain. It is not that the Heavenly Worthy abandons you—you must examine my sincerity.

**Chapter Five: Cultivating the Self and Upholding the Teachings**

The Three Realms are scrutinized, as are the Five Peaks and the Three Officials. The Day-Patrolling Spirit Lords and the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings, along with the ledgers of sin and merit, the Central Pivot of Heaven’s Records—all are overseen. Seven assistants govern seventy-four subordinate bureaus, recording nothing too great or too small. At the Three Primes and Three Assemblies, reports are submitted to the Northern and Southern Offices. The Northern and Southern Offices determine the weight of deeds and report them to the Purple Tenuity. Lesser matters are sent to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Palaces, and the Thirty-Two Heavens for separate judgment. Grave matters are personally conveyed to the Jade Emperor or adjudicated by the Three Clarities, their clarity like a mirror, their fairness like still water.

Those who cultivate our Dao achieve completion through upholding the precepts. Serving one’s parents forms the marrow; refining the body forms the flesh and skin. Saving others is like a single hair; merit and virtue are one’s garments. If one is greedy for wealth, lustful, treacherous, or venomous—cast them down. If the heart craves meat, remember: another’s wealth is like the king’s grain—you must not hoard it. Another’s wife or daughter is like your own mother or daughter—you must not lust after them. Another’s goodness you must respect and never harm. Even the beasts and the six livestock—regard them as your children and endure not to eat their flesh.

Thus, if I wish to study immortality, the true youth must perfect the Ten Goodnesses and fulfill the Five Blessings. In life, become an immortal of the earth; in death, enter the Golden Chamber. No longer consume fire-cooked food or the Five Grains. Your soul will reside in the Vermilion Mound, undergoing refinement and preservation. You will tread the Jade Void, and the immortals will be your companions.

**Chapter Six: Upholding the Teachings and Cultivating the Real**

The study of the Dao has its foundation; the ascent to immortality has its ladder. Only by knowing the secret instructions can one penetrate the mysteries. The body will then have nothing to be ashamed of, and the heart nothing to doubt. In non-action and solitude, meditate in the stillness of night. The spirit lords of the five viscera will one by one take flight, ascending to the Central Pivot and the Bureau of Essential Matters. With no transgressions to record, your merit will be evident.

By day, absorb the essence of the sun; by night, consume the fluid of the moon. Refine your hun and po, and you will naturally benefit. Your spirit will soar to the Three and Five, ascending to the Celestial Pole. Naturally, your name will reach the Heavenly Chief. The Lords of the North and South will present your name and your person before the Celestial Court. The Gates of Heaven will not dare to obstruct you; the hundred officials of the Central Pivot will welcome you. Thus, you will first receive immense blessings, and later accumulate primordial merit. You will inscribe talismans to summon rain, command clouds and winds with a shout. In life, you will be granted true office from afar; in death, you will rightfully enter the lineage of immortals. You will not fall into evil destinies nor be bound to the underworld bureaus. Your body will become a true lord of the upper heavens, overseeing the affairs of the lower realms. Above, you will illuminate your nine generations of ancestors, who will also ascend to the boundless. Below, you will shelter your nine generations of descendants, all endowed with immortal potential. They will know no cold or hunger, and blessings will naturally follow.

Do not keep my words secret or prevent others from knowing them. Teach my children of the Red Dust to correct their errors and abandon their wrongs. Recite this scripture to ascend to the real. Whether you are a king or an emperor, it will dispel weapons and war. Whether for parents, siblings, or kin, it will plant the seeds of past affinities. Whether for the deceased, it will deliver their corporeal forms. All will attain their desires and follow the inclinations of their hearts. If your heart does not waver, you may study the Dao. You who study the Dao, reverently uphold my teachings.

**Chapter Seven: Ascending to the Real and Recognizing the Spirit**

Those who study the Dao and ascend to the real will ride clouds and fly upward. Heavenly scriptures will descend, and immortal palaces will welcome them. Who are these immortal officials? They are the various Perfected Ones. Twin dragons pull their chariots; mighty warriors bear their standards. Before them, heralds clear the way; behind them, celestial soldiers guard. Jade lads and jade maidens hold the seals and sashes. Silver-eared attendants transmit the Emperor’s commands. In this, there is no fear, no alarm. Naturally, your hun and po will undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound.

**The Vermilion Mound’s Great General wields flowing-gold fire bells.** Entering the celestial realm, Heaven has four gates. The Eastern Florescence Gate is governed by its overseers. Within presides the Sovereign of the Day’s Duty, the Primordial Lord. Within presides the Adjudicator, the Venerable Recording Deity. Within presides the Gatekeeper, the Vajra Warrior. Three Perfected Immortals inquire of your name, examine your transgressions, and rank your merits. Without error or fault, you may then enter. Two Recording Clerks escort you upward.

The Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper each have their True Lords. Once the Recording Clerks withdraw, the True Lords welcome you. In due order, they memorialize your ascent to the Purple Tenuity Court. At this moment, the Dao of immortality is achieved. Bowing to the Great Veil, the Primordial Jade Clarity, the Jade Emperor of the Luminous Heavens, and the Three Radiance Heavenly Worthies—these cannot be seen, only glimpsed in auspicious clouds. Jade lads transmit the decree, faintly audible. They bestow upon you cinnabar elixirs, golden pendants, and pearl tassels. Upon receiving them, you prostrate and dance in joy. True immortals will then instruct you in the rites of audience.

This scripture is truly wondrous, and thus its account is brief. Hold it in mind with care, lest you err or stray. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and divine officials will grant you elixirs, elevating you to heavenly rank.

**Chapter Eight: Shallow Practice and Corpse Liberation**

Those who practice the Dao shallowly may ascend as immortals through corpse liberation. Before death, they must possess good karmic conditions. When their kalpas of worldly dust are exhausted, their names are stricken from the registers of Mount Tai in the east and Mount Hua in the west. The Earth God’s divine lord dispatches two envoys to summon and guide their hun and po souls. At this time, you must firmly recall your karmic causes and, upon meeting the underworld officials, stand before the courts of the nether gates. Within lie tribunals and prisons, dreadful and alarming. Yet you must not fear; state your case directly, recount your karmic origins, and conceal nothing of your sincerity.

If your name is absent from the ledger of transgressions but present in the ledger of virtues, the True Lord of the Eastern Ultimate Who Saves from Suffering will question you with kind words, welcome you joyfully, and invite you to ascend in a jade carriage with four wheels. The attending deities on either side are as those in the ascent to reality. You must recognize their names and titles, for they escort your spirit to undergo refinement in the Vermilion Mound. Ascending through the ranks in due order, you wander freely upward, entering the gates of Heaven and the Purple Tenuity Court. Some receive elixirs, others true scriptures; jade lads transmit the edicts, just as in the flight to ascension.

Your bones and flesh remain behind, a discarded form—like the molted husk of a snake or cicada, foul yet fragrant. Your children and grandchildren, burying you with utmost sincerity, may struggle to relinquish their love, for worldly attachments linger. At times, you may return for a visit, and your descendants will weep, unable to see your form. If at this moment you cannot yet sever your emotions, fix your thoughts on the dusty realm, neither entering the netherworld nor accepting the dust of mortality. Sever affection, abandon love, and establish the foundation of your Dao. Your children and grandchildren may yet benefit from this. Ascending beyond ignorance and bondage also serves as a ladder to immortality. The ladder to immortality lies before your eyes, yet people remain unaware.

**Chapter Nine: Ranked Ascent and Registry Enrollment**

Those who ascend through corpse liberation share the same Dao but tread different paths, all called transcendence, their names inscribed in the true registers. Some receive transmission in life and posthumous elevation; others are elevated only after death. There are those who receive transmission but are not elevated, but none are elevated without prior transmission. Some serve in the Celestial Pivot’s administrative offices, others in its furnishings and arrays. Each has their rank, emerging from the Supreme Beginning Azure. Some are recorded, some named.

The upper rank is defined by filial piety, the middle by bodily refinement, and the lower by salvation—all transcend worldly dust. The primordial net unfolds naturally, arranging ranks. Enrollment in the registry is simple, not cumbersome. The Left and Right Bureaus oversee the Most Wondrous Forbidden Altar. Within lies the Near Forbidden, the Purple Tenuity Azure Altar. Within lies the essential ground, the Golden Portal Crimson Altar. The Three Clarities’ attending ministers serve as left and right aides. The Thirty-Two Heavens also have their chief ministers.

Within the mundane realm, there are civil and martial officials, civil and martial meritorious deeds. Grand envoys, minor envoys, envoys of various titles. True Persons command armies, six offices with twelve divisions. The Supreme Emperor bestows grace, each receiving secret talismanic words. The fewer the words, the greater their value; their language is unadorned. They strike directly at your heart, leaving no flaw.

Cloud chariots and cloud horses belong to the Three Clarities’ domain. Like jade refined by carving, like gold freed from ore—those who can be molded into vessels do not fail. Those who are cast aside, rejected. All named upper immortals occupy ranks among the immortals. Civil and martial registers naturally distinguish them. The Most High’s methods are simple, requiring neither paper nor ink. Recite the true scripture ceaselessly, and your heart will not waver. Once your hun and po souls are adept, attainment comes naturally.

**Chapter Ten: Ranked Enrollment and Graded Ascent**

People advance in sequence: the upper study to penetrate reality, the middle accumulate conduct, and the lower strive to achieve merit. Some serve as pure officials in the Nine Palaces, others as minor clerks. Appointments are made according to ability, names recorded among the various armies. The Three Heavens’ River Source and the Six Treasuries’ officials and soldiers—regardless of strength or weakness, men or women—ceaselessly follow karmic conditions to attain this supreme cause.

Jade lads radiate brilliance; upper-ranked women are among them. Those of lower rank may serve as female soldiers. Some possess innate skills, others innate numinosity. Good causes arise from study, and study is perfected through precepts. Initially, observe precepts with caution, avoiding forced labor. Cultivate these arts and accumulate virtues. What is learned in life becomes strength after death. Cloud paths arrange ranks, and the netherworld confers offices. Each develops their strengths, naturally free from confusion.

Those of higher virtue may lack ability yet possess it, lack knowledge yet know, lack awareness yet understand—this is the power of the ten virtues. Thus, some remain empty, nurturing themselves in tranquility, their names listed among the unassigned officials. The Supreme Emperor’s talismans descend, entrusting them with tasks for careful consideration. Some join the ranks of the forbidden and near, others serve as supernumerary officials. Some become jade lads, attending the Morning Ultimate’s imperial chambers. Others serve as attendants, hurrying through palace corridors. Some become warriors, their armor and shields radiating light. Upper generals hold rank, commanding troops on the march. Some serve as generals in charge, others as common soldiers in the ranks.

The Eight-Nine Blessed Lands, the Six-Six Grotto-Heavens.
Rivers and seas, mountains and peaks—each bears its name.
Rewarded according to merit, with not a hair’s breadth of partiality.
The Celestial Pivot’s registers record all who preside over affairs,
scrutinizing ingress and egress, leaving no matter unchecked.

**Chapter Eleven: On the Resolve to Cultivate the Dao**

Those who attain the Dao must also cultivate resolve and learning.
Neither partial nor crooked, they transgress not against perverse desires.
Even a single stray thought brings the dark officials to examine and punish.
The celestial statutes and divine mechanisms arise from the subtle and obscure.
They fortify their forms, leaving nothing adrift or lost,
preserving their long lives, never falling into the dusty world.

The people of the dusty world—emperors and kings, the hundred officials and noble kinsmen,
as well as farmers—all below the heavens possess their own causes.
According to their karma, they receive either nobility or poverty,
lowliness or wealth, all issuing from the heart.

The gods of the various heavens are none other than mortals.
When mortals cultivate the Dao, they become celestial gods.
When celestial gods neglect cultivation, they are again bound to the dusty world.
Through learning, one avoids falling; by upholding precepts, one can follow the Way.
After fifty myriad kalpas, one becomes the Venerable Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng.
After twenty-four kalpas, one becomes the Perfected Martial General.
After ten million kalpas, one becomes the Perfected Savior from Suffering.
After fifteen kalpas, one becomes the Solar Attendant Yuanjun.

These are not transformed bodies but mortals of the world,
who die to become gods, ascend as immortals.
The celestial officials record their surnames,
the earthly officials register their names,
the aquatic officials note their merits.
The Celestial Pivot’s central bureau records their ranks and titles.
Those with merit and no transgressions endure through kalpas without falling.
At the Three Primordials’ examinations, their names stand in extraordinary ranks.
By the Jade Emperor’s decree, their virtue and conduct are exalted.
Such great immortals are too numerous to record;
I cite but one or two to convey my intent.
All later learners must cultivate resolve and learning without cease.

The heavens hold texts, the heavens hold registers.
Through them, one may establish merit or redeem sins.
Fortunate to possess this foundation, do not cast it aside.
Hungry ghosts and beasts are not distinct kinds—
each arises from the sins committed by humans.
The hells of earth and heaven must not be taken lightly.

**Chapter Twelve: The Heavenly Dao’s Secret Writings**

All who cultivate to become upper immortals must know their destination.
The heavens conceal names, the heavens conceal characters.
The Most High Three Purities: Kongtong and Chier.
The Jade Emperor and Purple Tenuity: Zhiyuan and Zhongzhi.
The Northern and Southern Dippers, recorded by the Three Terraces.
Zixin, Ziyin, Gengxu, Dingren, Zigui’s gods.
Mengshu, Mengliang, Zhongbao, Zhongqing,
Jiyu, Jiqian—these are the Two Courts.
Within the Three Terraces: Yunyu and Qijing,
Fengliang, Qingqi, the Four Sage Divine Lords.
The Greater Yang and Greater Yin, the honored stars of sun and moon,
named Xuannü, the gods of the Five Phases.
These too have alternate designations:
the Water Star is called Yan,
the Fire Star Ying,
the Wood Star Miao,
the Metal Star Jian,
the Earth Star Zhen.

They oversee all authority, the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Gonghua, Yaobo, Yangguan, Tangxuan.
Muju, Zitai, Anaxuan, Danfa.
Changjia, Zhihou, Gunteng.
Shajie, Nachou, Huifu, Yangzhen.
These are their concealed names, recorded in the *Scripture of Salvation*.
All lineages establish their standards, transmitting the orthodox wheel.
Qiaozi, Meijin, Shoushan, Teling.
Yueshi, Baojia, Fenglü, Zhuyan.
Baipeng, Deshu—these are the scriptural stars.
The Five Stars arrayed as weft, each with its transformed body.
The master of the Celestial Pivot is called Daoling,
encompassing earthly images, all serving as chief overseers.
The Five Peaks and Four Waterways each possess their mechanisms.
All are listed in the numinous books; reciting them dispels calamities,
for all ghosts stand in awe.
The names of the people of the Sand River do not escape its records.

**Chapter Fifteen: Exegesis on the Numinous Writ’s Sanskrit**

**The Primordial Vastness of the Most High**

Within the primordial chaos of the Most High, divine immortals dwell.
Among these immortals, ranks of great transcendents stand.
The constellations array in splendor, the Four Symbols encircle all.
Originally born in the human world, they cultivated the true canon.
Resplendent in achievement, they suddenly ascended in flight.
The Heavenly Emperor’s officials were commanded to bestow upon them seats at the banquet.
The Supreme Lord conferred names—*The Numinous Writ Concealing the Mysterious*.
The annals of the Numinous Writ govern the immortals’ dominion.
*Tatha sugata*—this is their foremost.
Recite but one chapter to dispel baleful karmic ties.
Hearing your invocation, they arrive in an instant.
Some appear robed in cloud-like raiment, others with jade pendants chiming.
Some manifest as Daoist adepts, others as officials of rank.
Some take the form of mighty warriors, others as tiger-like guards.
They protect your recitation of scripture, whose meaning is profoundly abstruse.
Abstruse beyond abstruseness—close your eyes and meditate in stillness.
The Thirty-Two Heavens ascend to true spirit-awareness.
Once soul and spirit are refined, you naturally enter the realm.
I possess a treasure chart, and behind it, a treasure register.
Those who practice this will naturally attain the Dao in full.
The method for refining form, the art of cultivating truth,
The medicine to save others, the blessings to teach them—
All begin with filial piety and fraternal duty, extending to aiding and assisting.
The radiance within Heaven, the essence within Heaven,
The elixir within Heaven, the flower within Heaven.
After practicing this, you may attain them.
Recite ten thousand times, and your body shall dwell in the Southern Palace,
Your name heard by the Supreme Lord.
Riding the wind, commanding the void, you shall move freely,
Now west, now east.
Among later disciples, those who wish to listen and follow—
Let them heed these words.

**Chart and Register May Enter the Canon: Chapter Sixteen**

All young disciples of immortality must know how to concentrate the spirit.
What is concentrating the spirit? It is transforming the body’s form.
Through this, one may refine and nurture, naturally ascending to truth.
What is ascending to truth? It is recognizing the spirit.
How does one recognize the spirit? By obtaining my treasure chart.
This is the root of primordial qi, the guiding principle of its flow.
The medicine for ascending as an immortal, the method for ascending as an immortal—
How may one obtain them? What is their cause?
What is their cause? Filial piety and fraternal duty toward the six relations.
Those who practice filial piety may study my scripture.
My scripture is no ordinary text—it is the talisman of the Supreme Lord.
Wearing the talisman and pacing the chart, one suddenly rides the void.
The radiance of the sun and moon, the essence of the five stars—
Combined, they form the elixir to nurture your form.
The sharpness of the sun and moon, the edge of the five stars—
Forged, they become a sword to protect your body.
Once the body’s form is firm, life and nature are at peace.
There is also a sacred talisman to repel ghosts.
When ghosts and evil cannot invade, the Dao is accomplished.
Use it to save the people below, to transcend life and death.
The offices of Heaven, the duties of Heaven,
The robes of Heaven, the sustenance of Heaven.
In your ears, immortal medicine; in your eyes, immortal flowers.
Roaming freely in the heavens, you enter the home of the Three Clarities.
Within it are fixed officials, close ministers,
The honored ones of Heaven, the gods of Heaven,
The duties of Heaven—attain them, and your name is listed.
All young disciples of immortality, do not fail my teachings.
Practice them with care, cultivate my supreme Dao.
If there are virtuous ones who study with sincere hearts,
Swear an oath upon golden tablets, and invoke the gods in prayer—
Do not recklessly pass these to others.

**The Wondrous Treasure Chart: Chapter Seventeen**

What is the treasure chart? The mechanism for ascending to truth.
Face north with your back to the south, and visualize the star altar.
How high should the altar be? Nine feet and two inches.
The sun and moon to left and right, the two Dipper stars before and behind,
The Canopy above, with the Vermilion Bird,
White Tiger, Azure Dragon, and Dark Warrior as one,
Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun—each in their proper place without error.
Concentrate the spirit and guide the qi, press the Mao character,
Clad in ritual robes as prescribed in the register.
Proceed directly to the gate, enter through the Ding Barrier,
Three steps of the Ding Barrier, ascending one level of the altar.
From the altar, move left, recite my divine incantation,
And proceed straight to the Earth Gate.
Again, move left, recite my divine incantation,
And enter straight through the Heavenly Gate—
Entering the Heavenly Gate, as if there were immortals.
Two immortals, a Jade Lad and Jade Maiden,
Attend to incense and convey words to guide you.
Kneel long, close your eyes, and if a divine being appears,
Riding five-colored clouds, clad in the robes of the Upper Clarity,
Transmitting the Jade Emperor’s talisman, calling your name—
Another will come forth, bearing a jade goblet,
Within the jade goblet, a nectar of jade mist.
In the Northern Dipper, a black qi;
In the Southern Dipper, a red qi;
In the sun and moon, that crimson qi, that white qi;
In the Canopy, the five-colored qi—
Flowing into the cup, if you can receive it,
Bow twice and drink.
Release the mudra and descend the altar, circling right as you exit,
Reciting my incantation—naturally, there will be benefit.
On Gengshen and Jiazi days, at the Three Origins and Three Assemblies,
Practice diligently, and the guiding principle of the primordial qi’s flow shall be revealed in full secrecy.

Thus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Luminous Cavern Spirit Upper Grade Scripture*.
Here begins the *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Cavern Spirit Upper Grade Scripture*.

**Chapter Eighteen: Wearing the Precious Register**

The Heavenly Worthy saves the world;
Wear the register and enact the guiding principle.
Ascend three steps upon the altar,
Then once more drink the misty nectar.
Descend the altar, turn right to exit,
Pacing the Dipper to form the *kui* and *piao*.
The Six Stars cover your head;
Turn your body to enter the Dipper’s mouth.
Step by step, tread the colorless path,
Pass through *Ji*, revolve the Dipper’s *gang*.
Having traversed the Five Constants,
You drift serenely to the Emperor’s realm.
Then you see the Golden Gate’s honored one—
I have roamed the ten directions.
Departing heaven to receive heaven’s rank,
Soul and spirit naturally find peace.
Should you wish to know my precious chart,
The two scrolls will surely reveal it.
Should you wish to know my precious register,
The register holds its true method.
Take that Jade Emperor’s script,
Face the Dipper and write with cinnabar.
On every *jiazi* day,
Inscribe it within your home.
Each day ingest one passage,
And naturally vital essence will flourish.
Wear it without parting,
And you may become an immortal.
The immortal’s home is not distant—
The primordial guiding principle allows ascent to the farthest reaches.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Heaven-and-Earth Gate Incantation**

Who can learn immortality?
To learn immortality, there is a method.
The immortal’s method is not difficult—
It lies within my precious chart.
Wear the register and enact the chart,
And divine protection will naturally follow.
Before you is the precious register,
Which may be ingested.
How to wear it?
Follow its methods and arts.
Burn incense and visualize the altar,
The altar lofty and towering.
Ascend to invoke the spirits,
Descend to pace the *gang*.
Every person’s soul
Must have its secret incantation.
What is this incantation?
Daily, visualize the earthly gate.
Recite this incantation:
*"The immortal’s path stretches vast,
The Primordial Beginning’s home.
I wish to ascend the altar,
To purify the spirit and transform thoughts.
May I receive the Most High’s
Bestowal of flowing mist.
The mist’s nectar,
Spreads qi in fragrant array.
Having ingested it,
I may pace the *gang*.
The Five Viscera’s Spirit Lords,
The Fragrant Officials of the Day,
Hearing my secret incantation,
Each finds peace."*
After entering the Heavenly Gate,
There is also a secret incantation:
*"Supreme Great Luo,
Great Luo of Jade Purity.
Within the Jade Purity’s palace,
The Dharma-Perfected of the Degrees.
Hearing my secret incantation,
Transmit my bodily form.
Take that jade mist
To purify my spirit.
Now I pace the *gang*,
Proceeding to the Emperor’s realm.
Proceeding to the Emperor’s realm,
I ascend to meet the Jade Emperor."*
After reciting the secret incantation,
Descend from the stellar altar.
Its incantations are contained
Within the two scrolls of the numinous scripture.
Within the numinous scripture,
The names of the hundred spirits.
The thirty-two heavens,
The twenty-five divisions.
The governing spirits
All come to welcome.
The guiding spirits
Revolve and encircle.
Ascending to the Golden Gate,
There is the Supreme Mystery.

**Chapter Twenty: The Roster of Summoned Spirits**

The *Scripture of Pure Brightness*
Is the origin of all methods.
Practicing it has its Way—
Commanding ghosts and spirits.
Dispelling illness and misfortune,
Summoning rain and moving clouds.
To transcend life and death,
To save the myriad people.
Enacting the precious chart,
Wearing the register and pacing the *gang*.
When the Dao is fulfilled and merit complete,
Your name is recorded in the Emperor’s realm.
What spirit would not obey?
What ghost would not conceal itself?
There is the Capital Marshal,
The Capital Envoy.
There are the outer and inner altars.
The inner and outer altars
Command thirty-six generals.
Seizing ghosts, shackling ghosts,
Binding ghosts, interrogating ghosts.
Disheveled *yakshas*,
Yellow-headed jailers.
There is the Wheel of Fire,
The Four Directions’ Majestic Virtue.
The Numinous Officer Five Lords,
The Twelve *Yakshas*.
There are the Patrols,
The Illuminating Seizers.
The Swift Seizers,
The Soul-Pursuers.
Such generals
Each have their deputies.
*Qianyuan Hengli*,
*Tucha* and *Guotian*.
Summon the living souls,
And the dead souls.
Further, there are thunder chariots,
And the Thunder Department.
Each has its regulation by the Heavenly Pivot,
And its station in the *gang*’s domain.
The method of their use
Has its own summons.
Each has its summons—
The sound follows the qi’s arrival.
Qi and spirit intersect,
And they naturally appear before you.
They may be commanded,
The heavenly generals and officers.
Each has its tally of troops,
Dream and sleep revelations,
Unfailing in their timing.
This is called the essential art
Of the *Three-Five Flying Steps*,
The *Luminous Cavern*’s method of commanding ghosts and spirits.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Three-Five Flying Steps**

The *Three-Five Flying Steps*
Are the essence of the flowing guiding principle.
Heavenly Hero, Heavenly Task,
Heavenly Pillar, Heavenly Heart.
Heavenly Bird, Heavenly Auxiliary,
Heavenly Impulse, Heavenly Interior.
Reaching Heavenly Peril—
These are the seven transformations.
Corresponding above to heaven,
Like that primordial guiding principle,
It is the utmost subtlety.
The Three Terraces’ six steps
Emerge from the Dipper’s mouth.
The seven-sevens’ number,
Leftward circling to form fire—
This is called the True and Orthodox.
Eastward nine-nines,
To complete the Great Yang.
Westward eight-eights—
This is called the Great Yin.
Right revolving then left,
Left then right revolving,
Altogether seven reversals.
Leftward proceeding east,
To traverse the ten directions.
The ten directions’ stars,
The twenty-eight lodgings.
Each lodging’s *ding-gang*,
Twelve in number.
From *Ji* revolving the Dipper,
The Dipper revolving into *Ji*,
Directly facing the Great *Piao*.
Leftward revolving south,
Forty-nine steps—
This is called crossing blades and doubling the Fire Star.
Passing through the Great Yin,
Six-sixes’ steps,
Completing the Water Lodging.
From Water eastward,
To the side of the Great Yang.
Leftward forming Wood,
Sixty-four steps.
Revolving again—
This is the *Wu-Ying*.
The Duke’s Son offends Water,
Borrowing the *gang* to reemerge beside the Moon.
This becomes the Metal Star,
The White Prime Honored Spirit.
Proceeding minutely to the center,
Reaching the Dipper’s mouth.
Thirty-five steps
To complete Earth.
From Earth, the qi’s summation,
Borrowing Metal’s *gang*.
Returning to the Water Lodging,
Entering the Wood Chronogram.
Facing north,
Eight steps and eight luminaries,
To pay homage at the Heavenly Gate.
The *Three-Five* method
Is but its essential outline.
Expanding it further,
Its reckoning does not exceed the *Three-Five*’s number.
Thus,
You may summon the spirits and command them.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Facing Heaven to Meet the Emperor**

The *Eight Luminaries of Heavenly Hero*
Are all called *Facing Heaven*.
The Three Purities’ Supreme Emperor,
The Purple Tenuity’s Dark Heaven.
Knock the teeth five times—
All appear before you.
Nothing is not made clear,
Nothing is left unspoken.

Here follows the translation:

---

This is what is called *Stepping the Dipper to Face Heaven*.
It can cure illness and avert misfortune,
It can nurture the true and cultivate practice,
It can fulfill one’s utmost filial piety,
It can command ghosts and spirits.
The Four Saints of Heavenly Torch,
And all the Perfected of every rank,
None fail to come in welcome.
At this time, Heaven bestows numinous elixir:
To the left, seven bonds form the Lord of the Sun;
To the right, seven slayers form the Lord of the Moon.
Swallowing and breathing—
This is the true elixir.
There is the odd, there is the even,
There is the yang, there is the yin.
The elixir of yin and yang,
When ingested, grants long life.
Some attain extended lifespan,
Some achieve liberation through *shi*-transformation and become Perfected.
Some gain penetrating vision,
Able to scrutinize the hundred spirits.
The secret of Heaven’s Center,
The scripture of Heaven’s Center,
The office of Heaven’s Center,
The duty of Heaven’s Center—
Each is attained within the body,
Not necessarily through a master’s transmission,
But arising from Heaven’s completion.
What is Heaven’s completion?
The method of *Facing Heaven*.
Through it, one may wondrously enter the Supreme,
And naturally reach the *Beginning Azure*.
At this time,
The Ten Heavenly Demon Kings,
The Great Gods of Long Life,
The True Emperors of the Five Directions,
Guard and protect one’s form.
Like the sun and moon,
The longer they endure, the brighter they grow.
Like the Five Phases,
They wheel and turn without cease.
Some attain the ascension of parents to Heaven,
And blessings of prosperity for descendants.
This is truly the *qi* entering the *Mystery of Mysteries*.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Cultivating Merit to Achieve Reality**

Who does not desire to attain immortality?
Study immortality in youth.
In youth, serve with loyalty and filial piety,
Accumulating long practice to form a root of goodness.
Moreover, perfect the *qi* and blood,
Ascending and descending within the cinnabar field.
Hold talismans to cure others’ illnesses,
And hidden virtue may transcend the ordinary.
Cultivate practice using my method—
What worry is there of not ascending to Heaven?
I possess the *Scripture of Purity and Luminosity*;
Recite it to learn loyalty and filial piety,
And refine the bodily form.
Spiritual luminaries come to assist,
And thus one may cure a hundred illnesses.
Through this, initiate the primal merit,
And one may reach the realm of immortals.
Escape the gate of afflictions,
Enter the realm of clarity and brightness.
Riding the cloud of the mysterious crane,
One naturally soars through the void.
Should one wish to command ghosts and spirits,
They will follow like child servants.
The *Six Jia* and *Six Ding*—
This method emerges from their origin.
Cultivate merit to achieve reality,
And through this, refine and polish.
Naturally, one obtains my method,
And within a hundred days, sees ghosts and spirits.
How does one assist the Supreme Emperor?
He dispatches them to aid you.
If you are good at upholding the Dao,
Even the various demons and devils
Will wish to pay homage to you.
This is due to the quality of loyalty and filial piety,
And the preservation of true *qi*.
Having merit among the multitude,
One ranks among the immortals’ assembly.
Those who cannot practice this Dao
Will find it difficult to obtain the method.
Even if one obtains my method,
This art will not be efficacious.
If loyalty and filial piety are not in the heart,
*Qi* and blood are lost for the sake of profit.
The Dao of immortality grows ever more distant,
Obtaining the method is like steaming sand.
Steaming sand to make rice,
Expending effort, yet it cannot be cooked.
Though there is the heat of fire and *qi*,
It cannot be eaten.
Among the various immortals of the Southern Palace,
Not one has been heard of who is unfilial.
Practice filial piety to study immortality—
Studying immortality should be easily accomplished.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Praise and Concealment of Secret Standards**

The Supreme Emperor arranges offices,
The officials of the various heavens.
The true offices of Heaven’s officials,
Each possesses its wondrousness.
According to what one has studied,
He rewards with secret characters,
Combining them into fine appellations,
To perfect the Supreme Dao.
Serving both parents with devotion is called *filial piety*.
Respectfully serving the lord is called *loyalty*.
Harmony with elder brothers and friendship is called *fraternal duty*.
Amity with relatives is called *harmony*.
Nurturing one’s nature and life is called *authenticity*.
Comprehending the canonical teachings is called *Dao*.
Diligence in rectifying the mind is called *virtue*.
Commanding ghosts and spirits is called *sageliness*.
Achieving utmost sageliness is called *divinity*.
Clarity in perception and understanding is called *wisdom*.
Wisdom that radiates forth is called *numinosity*.
Virtue and conduct that do not change are called *stability*.
Stability that does not change is called *responsiveness*.
Diligence in upholding the Dao and its methods is called *reverence*.
Adherence to precepts and regulations is called *conduct*.
Virtue sufficient to radiate forth is called *manifestation*.
Manifestation that does not waver is called *radiance*.
Radiance of great brilliance is called *excellence*.
Refining the hun and po souls is called *purity*.
Commanding without selfishness is called *resoluteness*.
Collecting many numinous scriptures is called *assembly*.
Substance that may be employed is called *pattern*.
Virtue and conduct that are not deviant are called *verification*.
Universal love without weariness is called *benevolence*.
Beauty that may be praised is called *excellence*.
Possessing all good affinities is called *fruit*.
Reverence without weariness is called *solemnity*.
Such categories as these,
Numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands,
Are all contained in the canonical texts.
Those who study the Dao,
Diligently practice them,
And thus the praise and concealment of secret standards
Arise naturally from within.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Jade Regulations and True Mechanism**

The true essentials of the Jade Regulations,
The *Purple Court* and the *Ghostly Azure*.
There is natural meaning,
There is natural clarity.
Diligently cultivate the Orthodox Teaching,
And the Great Dao is accomplished.
Obscured and deluded,
Evil fills to overflowing.
Purity without defilement is called *purity*.
Vigilance and apprehension are called *diligence*.
Desire that is not yet attained is called *authenticity*.
Covetous desire that is not yet attained is called *authentic covetousness*.
Taking what is not to be taken,
Stealing what is not stealing,
Lust that is not lust,
Rebellion that is not rebellion,
Compliance that is not compliance.
Compliance and rebellion, rebellion and compliance,
Good and evil, evil and good.
Repentance and awakening to study the Dao
Are called *supreme goodness*.
Affectation contrary to the Dao
Is called *great evil*.
Life that is not true life,
Killing that is not true killing.
Concealing goodness is corruption,
Hiding evil is deception.
Killing yet wishing for life—
This is called *love of life*.
Seeing and wishing to kill—
This is called *love of killing*.
Those who resent their parents
Cannot obtain life;
Though they live, they may be killed.
Thus, the truly filial do not die,
The utmost filial attain immortality.
The Dao of immortality is easy,
The way of ghosts is difficult.
Goodness is the constant of good people,
Evil is the pretense of evil people.
Goodness, through habitual practice, may become evil;
Evil, if not evil and reformed, becomes goodness.
Thus, those who reveal arrogance receive reward,
Those who secretly accumulate meet execution.
Using pretense to encourage goodness is called *sincerity*,
Using honesty to gloss over faults is called *deception*.
Yin transgressions are great,
Yang transgressions are small.
Transgressions arising within yet not revealed—
The offense is already grave.
Acts performed outwardly yet accompanied by shame—
The offense is already absolved.
Do not suppress others’ goodness;
Those who suppress others’ goodness turn their backs on the Dao.

Though seizing another’s goodness, those who seize goodness turn toward the Dao.

Heaven’s light emerges from earth,
Fire illuminates human radiance—
A mirror by which one may know.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Penetrating Knowledge of Past Lives**

Illumine the true without obscurity,
Penetrate knowledge of past lives.
Attain former habits,
To cultivate good roots.
Without error or fault,
Study the divine immortals.

What is the Dao of immortals?
Where the numinous nature reaches.
Only through penetrating knowledge
Can one attain the mysterious precepts.
The mysterious precepts are most clear—
Behold my former studies.
With those former studies,
One may repeatedly transgress,
One may repeatedly achieve,
And naturally become true.
Becoming true is not difficult,
Attained only through learning.
Through eternal kalpas unchanged,
True knowledge unconfused—
This is penetrating knowledge.

From that penetrating knowledge,
One reaches penetrating spirit.
From that penetrating spirit,
One can achieve penetrating vision.
What is called *penetrating*?
Dark and light all discerned,
Bright and obscure unshaken—
This is supreme wisdom.

The spirit soars in threes and fives,
Roaming and feasting among the heavens.
Above the heavens,
Each has its true person.
The arts of the true person
Are most clear in meaning.
Purify the viscera,
Nurture the essence-spirit.

The medicine of nature,
Talismans and incantations most efficacious.
There is the celestial drum—
Struck, it resounds mightily.
There is the jade spring—
Drawn, it overflows.
The coming of the jade spring,
The nectar of the flower pool,
Its essence like honey,
Its flavor most true.

Swallow and rinse, sound the drum,
Six by six, complete the cycle.
To preserve my spirit,
Bathe in the moon, wash in the sun.
Sun and moon now bright,
Heaven and earth illuminated.
The myriad forms unfold,
The spirit-soul transcends.

This is the clarity of penetrating vision,
By which to examine ghosts and spirits.
It can illuminate ten thousand miles,
It can illumine one’s own body.
Guarded by ghosts and spirits,
It reaches the subtle and obscure.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Reviving the Dead and Restoring Life**

Spittle eases cultivation,
Stroking qi to unite with spirit.
The Five Celestial Great Demons,
Ancestors of the ten thousand spirits.
Summon them to return—
Within, there is a true person.
Preserve life, secure its root,
Gather and guide the hun and po souls.
Return them to their dwelling,
Unshaken, unagitated.
Control them so they do not scatter—
Withered trees bloom anew.

Chaos and obscurity merge,
Converging in the mud-pill palace.
Within the mud-pill palace,
It connects to the crimson palace.
The spirit of the crimson palace,
Returning, reverts to the true.
Thus, dry bones
May live again,
All rising to become human.

At this time, there are:
The Demon Mud,
The Dharma Ancestor,
The Return to True,
The Bewildered,
The Profound Net—
Envoys of the Five Celestial Heavens,
Known as Zhao, Meng, and Wu.
They command the flying hun and soaring po ghosts,
Summoned by secret formulas,
Directed by methods.
As the sovereign of the body,
They are the Dharma Kings of liberating the dead.

There is also the upright qi,
Spread within and without.
Within and without now harmonized,
It reaches the joints.
Unshaken, unagitated,
Suddenly, one attains it.

Then recite the incantation:
*True Person of Reviving Life,
True Person of Saving from Suffering.
Spittle eases cultivation,
Unite qi to merge with spirit.
Hun and po souls return again,
The register of death removes the name.
The Five Celestial Great Demons,
Liberate the corpse’s form.
Let so-and-so live again,
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*

As for the secret formulas for the eyes and joints preserved in the esoteric texts—
If one encounters a person of karmic affinity,
They may receive and uphold them.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Underworld’s Examination of Forms**

On Mount Fengdu,
There are prisons and cells.
A Great Emperor Lord
Presides over its judgments.
Tens of thousands of demonic nets,
Examine and punish evil ghosts.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths,
Dying and being reborn.
Through kalpas of cyclic rebirth,
They become the six livestock.

Asking the reason—
All due to lack of filial piety.
The five rebellions of unfilial conduct
Stem from the root of the heart.
A foolish heart unrepentant
Soon becomes disobedience.
Disobedience and unfiliality
Transform into disloyalty.
Greed for wealth, greed for beauty,
Greed for wine, greed for lust.
From these causes and conditions,
Many misfortunes arise.
Offending yin and yang,
Provoking heaven and earth.
The twelve double-hours
Record their transgressions.
Reported to the celestial court,
The celestial court issues its decree.
Delivered to the celestial pivot,
Their hun souls are bound,
After death, entering Fengdu.

Those who can recite this scripture
Will have their sins and evils naturally dissolve.
Recite the scripture, practice filial piety and brotherly respect,
Reform conduct, repent past wrongs.
Become a divine immortal,
Naturally ascending the celestial thoroughfare.
The celestial thoroughfare is difficult to ascend—
Practice holds its secret method.
The secret method is not hard to seek—
Filial piety naturally attains it.

Meet with those of insight,
Awaken to the scripture’s meaning.
Understand and strive to practice—
Then escape the paths of Fengdu.
Without abandoning past transgressions,
One may redeem the hun souls of ancestors.
Follow the heart, practice filial piety and brotherly respect—
No need to recite this scripture.
This scripture repents foolishness,
Used to deliver those sunk in suffering.

May all my immortal disciples
Keep filial piety and brotherly respect in their hearts.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Pure and Bright Orthodox Seal**

The myriad methods of the Pure and Bright
Begin and end in forty chapters.
Take filial piety as the origin,
The body as the foundation.
Only filial piety can be studied—
Through it, ascend to the celestial palace.
The celestial palace is originally in the eyes,
Yet my Dharma is not practiced.
Recite this *Pure and Bright Scripture*,
And practice the Pure and Bright Dharma.
The Dharma can dispel a thousand disasters,
And cure the essence of ten thousand demonic spirits.
When merit is complete, it naturally perfects,
Through a thousand kalpas, the body is not lost.

In the hall, an elder of a hundred years,
Within the household, no partiality.
Still, there is a white-haired grandson,
Playing and laughing in the central courtyard.
This is the primordial qi,
Entering the mysterious and profound.
Within the profound precepts,
Thirty-five divisions.
Further, there are wondrous teachings,
Two chapters of the *Numinous Scripture*.

They can extend life to a thousand or a hundred,
See ghosts and spirits,
Transmute gold and jade,
Summon wind and rain,
Save the departed hun souls,
Dispel weapons and war.
Only by firmly upholding my teachings,
Reciting this scripture,
Will divine immortals naturally appear.
With these three chapters,
Teach you to chant and recite them—
Then you may become a supreme perfected one.

Becoming a true person is not difficult—
Study begins with filial piety.
Filial piety and brotherly respect are not hard to practice—
Follow the heart in serving parents.
Parents are originally celestial venerables—
May you awaken to this in your heart.

**Chapter Thirty: The Pure and Bright Numinous Treasure Talisman**

Recite my *Scripture of Pure Brightness*,
And further practice the Pure Brightness Dharma.
First cultivate filial piety,
Then refine the body’s form.
Once the body’s form is settled,
True qi subdues the hundred ghosts.
Rescuing and protecting all sentient beings,
One may achieve meritorious deeds.
Accumulating merit is not difficult—
Diligently study the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*.
The Pure Brightness holds sacred talismans,
With incantations and signs most distinct.
Within resides the Numinous Treasure Venerable,
The Numinous Treasure Great Perfected One.
The Celestial Pivot’s Chief Recorder,
The Day-Watch Supreme Primordial Lord.
They oversee the secret teachings and practices,
Which, when performed, are naturally efficacious.
There are also great divine generals,
The Ten Celestial Great Demon Kings,
The Four Sage Great Generals,
The Sixteen Inner and Outer Generals,
The Four Watch Direct Talisman Officers.
They act on your behalf to activate the numinous talismans,
They act on your behalf to accomplish meritorious arts.
One who is unfilial and practices this Dharma
Is like snow cast into boiling water—
The transgression dissolves of itself,
And the unfilial transforms into sincere devotion.
Sincere devotion is foremost,
And further, one may save the world’s people.
Merit accumulates and is recorded in the heavens above,
And the Dao of immortality naturally manifests.
To know one who practices filial piety,
Recite again the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*.
Practicing this Pure Brightness Dharma
Is like a dragon’s feet generating clouds.
Once the dragon’s feet generate clouds,
Wind and thunder are all at your command—
The sacred talismans of Pure Brightness are efficacious.

**Chapter Thirty-One: Deliverance of the Six Relations**

The first talisman:
If one can receive and uphold it for parents and the six relations,
On the day of their fateful destiny,
Inscribe the talisman with cinnabar,
Hold the mudra and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King.
Recite the incantation and inscribe the talisman,
Have the person ingest it—
Then parents and the six relations will naturally enjoy longevity.

The second talisman:
If one can receive and uphold it for parents and the six relations,
On the day of their death,
Inscribe the talisman with cinnabar,
Hold the mudra and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King.
Recite the incantation and inscribe the talisman,
Burn it and mix the ashes with clay,
Place it upon the deceased’s heart—
Then, by the power of this Dharma,
The departed will return to life from death,
Their hun and po souls will be reborn,
And they will naturally attain deliverance.

If one can practice these two talismans with utmost dedication,
The foundation of Dao-fruition is laid,
And only then may one proceed to refine and ingest qi.

Moreover, inscribe one talisman each day and burn it—
The living will be blessed with fortune,
The dead will attain immortality.
This is the eternal basis for liberation from life and death.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Refining the Body’s Form**

The first talisman bestowed
Enables one to ascend to heaven in flight.
The second talisman
Opens and illumines the celestial eye.
When the celestial eye and celestial ear
Reach the Mud-Pill Palace,
This is the essential method for refining the body’s form—
The so-called transformation and birth in the various heavens.

One who holds the mudra, recites the incantation,
And inscribes the two talismans daily with cinnabar to ingest them,
Will have the true qi of the sun, moon, and five planets infuse their body.
Ingesting it, one will be free from hunger
And naturally attain longevity.

When inscribing, visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King
And the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable—
Then the Celestial Venerable will descend with true qi
And abide within your body.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: Healing the Hundred Diseases**

The first method revives the dead to life,
The second preserves life and roots vitality.
For all who suffer illness,
Close the eyes and meditate in stillness,
Take up cinnabar, hold the mudra, and recite the incantation,
Visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King
And the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Savior from Suffering Celestial Venerable,
Form the talisman into a pellet with the incantation water and ingest it—
Then the afflicted will naturally recover.

Healing illness is called the power of the Dao.
Practicing the Dao with power is called gradual accumulation.
Practicing the Dao with methods is called attaining the Dao.
Practicing the Dao with filial piety is called the supreme Dao.

The Dao has three grades—upper, middle, and lower—
This is the lower grade.
Yet healing the hundred diseases
And relieving the suffering of others
Can also lead to immortality.
All who practice filial piety and ingest qi
Have perfected their merit.
This is the auxiliary practice for cultivating filial piety and refining qi.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Binding the Hundred Demons**

The talisman on the right binds the hundred demons.
Whenever spirits of local altars or the Five Penetrations cause disturbances,
Bringing harm to the people—
Such as doors opening and closing of their own accord,
Or ponds and reservoirs breaking—
Swiftly take this talisman, recite the incantation, and hold the mudra,
Inscribe it with cinnabar and affix it for suppression—
Then the disturbances will naturally dissipate.

When inscribing the incantation and talisman,
Face north and visualize oneself as the Filial Dao Radiant King
And the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable,
With the Four Sages wielding the talisman in action.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Pacification and Summoning**

For summoning all things—
Wind and thunder, earth gods, and all spirits of heaven and earth—
Inscribe the talisman and burn it,
And within seven days, they will arrive.
If one wishes to perform exorcism,
Inscribe the talisman on a large stone and bury it.

These are the secret talismans of the Supreme Filial Dao Radiant King
And the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Celestial Venerable.
When inscribing talismans,
Visualize oneself in their original form.

There are three scrolls of numinous scriptures,
To be transmitted only upon encountering a perfected person.

Here ends the lower scroll of the *Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Wondrous Dao, Highest Grade*.
