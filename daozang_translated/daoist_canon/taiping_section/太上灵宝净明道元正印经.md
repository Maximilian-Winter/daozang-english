**The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Pure Clarity Dao’s Primordial Upright Seal**

The Dao originally is no-thing, yet gathers in the void.
Within and without, it opens boundlessly, not accompanying things.
Amid the clamor before one, the perfect Dao remains serene.
Illumined and vast, solitary in vision, it fills and empties with the Dao.
Advancing and retreating, ebbing and flowing—like fish in the abyss.
By water they know not, yet is the Dao thus?
Those who know the Dao:
Their essence does not wither,
Their blood flows like a river,
Their qi rolls like a wheeling pearl,
Their body is like withered wood,
Their intent soars like a flying light.
They know not where they halt,
They know not where they dwell—
Simply so of itself.

The nature of the heart is tranquil,
Knowing the "thus" and the "not-thus,"
Yet not knowing what knowing is.
Acting yet not acting,
They abide in limpid clarity.
Within the Palace of Clarity,
Spirit dissolves, intent releases,
Emotions settle, essence unifies.

Oneness is the Dao,
One yet not clinging.
Not clinging, not deviating,
Not sticky, not tense.
Only in ease is attainment,
In supreme stillness, the empty chamber.
This is the root of the Dao,
Thought upright, harmonizing with principle.

The thought of no-thought—
Thought yet not thought.
The clarity of no-thought—
Thought yet settling form.

Long life and enduring vision—
One name for the Dao.
What is long life?
What is ruin and collapse?

The Dao is ever-present,
The heart enlightened, the nature luminous.
Enlightened, then enlightened;
Luminous, then luminous.
Yet enlightened is not enlightenment,
Luminous is not luminosity.
Not-enlightenment is enlightenment,
Not-luminosity is luminosity.
Luminous, enlightened—
Recognize our original form.

Within form dwells spirit,
Spirit has its extension.
Extending yet not bending,
Transcending, soaring, ascending.

What are wind-horses?
What are cloud-chariots?
Not issuing from the center—
Within the center is the real.
The real is the obscuration of the illusory,
Illusion is not the real.
By the real obscuring the illusory,
Real and illusory share the same gate.
Not grasping, not attaching,
Not joining, not merging.

Seeing the formless,
Hearing the soundless.
What are talismans?
What are true scriptures?
A settled heart, a wise spirit—
This is Pure Clarity.

Pure Clarity pervades the Three Realms,
Beyond lies the Jade Capital.
The Jade Capital, divine metropolis,
Where one roams and feasts in the Three Clarities.
This is called the *Primordial Upright Seal of the Dao*.
