**Scroll One of** *The Ritual Regulations and Precepts for Upholding the Dao in the Three Caverns: The Foundations of Discipline*
**Compiled by the Seven Perfected Ones of Golden Radiance**

The Seven Perfected Ones declare: Upon examining the great scriptures of the Three Caverns, we find that the rituals, regulations, and precepts are fully established. Whether for Daoist priests or female Daoist adepts, every movement and action—sitting, rising, resting, sleeping, clothing, diet, dwelling, and residence—is encompassed within the scriptural principles. The founding of temples, the salvation of beings, the creation of images, the transcription of scriptures, offerings and prostrations, the burning of incense and lighting of lamps, recitation and exposition, transmission and invocation, the rites of purification and fasting, and the methods of cultivation—each matter has its rules, all clearly set forth in the regulations. These have long been in place.

Yet the texts are vast and scattered, making thorough study and application difficult. Some may glimpse them briefly only to forget afterward; others see but do not practice, or practice incompletely. Some follow their own inclinations, acting as they please. When ascending the altar or entering meditation, their deportment varies. In rites of repentance and scripture recitation, each takes the other’s conduct as a standard, only to criticize in turn. Few adhere to the same path. Thus, those newly entering the Dao in later times cannot discern what is correct. With many paths leading astray, knowledge dwindles, and the way is lost. Indolence and negligence grow daily, while proper conduct declines over time.

Moreover, there is a tendency to compete in embellishment, vying to display skill and talent. At the time of invocation, new forms are devised; by the day of offering and gratitude, old rites are entirely abandoned. As months and years pass, the regulations and precepts fade into obscurity. Customs become entrenched, and scarcely one in ten remains. Those who follow the scriptures and precepts in full are met with scorn and derision. Violating and undermining the orthodox canon, they grow increasingly ignorant while believing themselves enlightened, only to sink deeper into confusion. Those who guard the precepts without precision bring about their own corruption and decay.

Looking back to earlier generations, we see this decline has long been underway. Gazing ahead to the future, it threatens to plunge into an abyss. Therefore, we have distilled the essentials of cultivation into five hundred and twelve articles, with eight chapters of ritual models, divided into three scrolls. Entitled *The Ritual Regulations and Precepts for Upholding the Dao in the Three Caverns*, all are drawn from the scriptural records, not fabricated from empty words. May they serve as a unified standard for all ages and a shared model for the ten directions. Those who walk the same path should propagate them widely.

Each section’s topics are outlined at the beginning of the scroll.

Some receive immediate retribution in this life and are born into such forms, all due to the transgressions of past lives.

Whether Daoist priests or female Daoist practitioners, all must follow these regulations, clearly instructing men and women so they may observe the precepts and regulations, thereby gaining immeasurable blessings.

**Section on General Examples, Part Three**

The section states: According to the *Laws of the Mysterious Capital* and the *Dharma Texts of the Orthodox Unity*, if Daoist priests, female Daoist practitioners, or ordinary people violate the scriptural precepts, all will have their *suan* (life-calculations) diminished or, as some say, shortened. *Suan* refers to the reduction of a person’s life-calculations, preventing longevity. Some consider sixty days as one *suan*, though there are differing accounts, hence both are mentioned here. After the reduction of *suan*, whether in death or while still living, all must further receive punishment according to the regulations, suffering the reduction of life-calculations. To increase *suan* is to add to it, thereby extending life. Daoist priests and female Daoist practitioners must understand the regulations and precepts and follow the Dharma accordingly.

The section states: If it is said that violating regulations incurs transgressions, all transgressions are determined according to the original regulations.

**Section on Establishing Abbeys, Part Four**

The section states: The supreme realms of the Three Clarities, the Ten Continents and Five Peaks, all famous mountains, and the grotto-heavens of the great void are all governed by sages. Some form palaces and halls from condensed *qi*, others gather clouds into terraces, pavilions, and chambers, while some dwell in the gates of stars, sun, and moon, or reside within mist, clouds, rosy clouds, and the skies. Some manifest naturally, others are constructed by divine power, some are built over kalpas, and others are established in an instant. Whether Penglai, Fangzhang, Yuanqiao, Yingzhou, Pingpu, Langfeng, Kunlun, or Xuanpu, or the Twelve Jade Towers, Three Thousand Golden Palaces, with myriad names and titles beyond count—all are the transformative traces of the Heavenly Worthy and the Supreme, the administrative seats of the divine immortals and transcendent beings, fully enumerated in the various scriptures, and thus not detailed here.

To guide the aspirations of humans and celestials and distinguish the realms of the worthy and the foolish, the abbeys of the divine are established, mirroring the heavens above. As blessed lands, they are also immortal dwellings, arranged in specific locales, each with its own system. There are six types: mountain gates, walled enclosures, palace precincts, villages, solitary retreats, and those dependent on others. All must be protected and constructed by emperors and ministers, with Daoist priests and female Daoist practitioners ordained to reside and make offerings. This is the foremost of the most excellent deeds, beyond comprehension.

Construct the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, the Lecture Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, the Dharma-expounding Courtyard, the Scripture Tower, the Bell Pavilion, the Masters’ Quarters, the Corridors, the Verandas, the Gate Towers, the Gatehouses, the Mystic Altar, the Refrectory, the Kitchen, the Scriptorium, the Scripture-Collating Hall, the Scripture-Expounding Hall, the Scripture-Fumigating Hall, the Bathing Hall, the Incense-Burning Courtyard, the Ascension Courtyard, the Ordination Courtyard, the Meditation Courtyard, the Pure Ones’ Quarters, the Mule and Horse Quarters, the Carriage and Ox Quarters, the Lay Visitors’ Quarters, the Ten Directions’ Guests’ Quarters, the Grinding and Milling Quarters, the Seeking the True Terrace, the Qi-Refining Terrace, the Praying to the True Terrace, the Absorbing the Scenery Terrace, the Scattering Flowers Terrace, the Gazing at Immortals Terrace, the Dew-Receiving Terrace, the Nine Clarities Terrace, the Wandering Immortals Pavilion, the Spirit-Concentrating Pavilion, the Cloud-Riding Pavilion, the Flying Simurgh Pavilion, the Extending the Spirit Pavilion, the Welcoming Wind Pavilion, the Nine Immortals Tower, the Extending the True Tower, the Dancing Phoenix Tower, the Carefree Tower, the Silent Contemplation Tower, the Welcoming Wind Tower, the Nine Perfected Tower, the Incense-Burning Tower, the Medicine-Compounding Hall, and so on. All are to be built in due time, with sizes and styles—whether grand or simple—determined by the available resources.

The medicinal gardens and orchards, rare trees and exotic herbs, clear ponds and fragrant flowers—all are to be cultivated and maintained for offerings, known as a blessed land or pure abode. They shall be preserved for eternal ages, never allowed to fall into decay, for the blessings they bring are boundless, their merit supreme.

**Regulations state:** For the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, whether three, five, seven, nine, eleven, or thirteen bays, the size shall be determined by the time and resources, adorned as circumstances permit, with eaves extending on all four sides. The residences of sages are called *halls*; those of the mortal world are commonly termed *chambers*.

In constructing all structures, there are six types of form:
1. **Noble woods and sacred timbers**
2. **Materials produced in season**
3. **Carvings of gold and jade**
4. **Roofs of floating stone**
5. **Paintings and illustrations in cinnabar and azure**
6. **Thatched cottages with earthen steps**

Some may be carved with phoenixes and dragons, others painted with clouds and moonlight, or feature inverted water caltrops and lotus ponds, blossoming seas of flowers. Some may gleam with jade ornaments and engraved railings, adorned with cinnabar terraces and jade-green steps, green locks and emerald patterns, or golden knockers and silver bolts, rainbow beams and cloud-like rafters. Some may have sunlit windows and moonlit casements, yin doors and yang shutters. Above, their eaves stretch freely; below, they coil amidst mist and clouds. Their breadth and length, depth and width, shall be determined by the time and means, for there is no fixed standard.

**Regulations state:** For the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, whether one, two, three, or five bays, the size and dimensions shall also be determined by the time and circumstances.

**Regulations state:** The Dharma Hall, where teachings are expounded and transformation is wrought, should be situated behind the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, with ample space to accommodate the multitude as the highest priority. If built elsewhere, it may be arranged as circumstances dictate.

**Regulations state:** The Dharma Courtyard should be established on either side of the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, built with sufficient width to hold the assembled listeners, with larger being preferable. The structures within shall be arranged as the time and convenience allow.

**Regulations state:** In constructing the Sutra Tower, its height, size, and adornment—whether ornate or plain—shall depend on the available resources. It must, however, accommodate the existing Three Caverns’ precious scriptures and the Four Supplements’ mysterious texts, allowing wind and sunlight to circulate while shielding from rain and dew. This shall be the foremost and finest arrangement, though it need not be permanent.

**Regulations state:** The construction of the Bell Pavilion shall follow the same principles as the Sutra Tower. It must be sturdy, with open sides to ensure the bell’s sound carries unimpeded, resonating clearly through the six periods of the day. It should stand before the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, opposite the Sutra Tower—bell to the left, scriptures to the right. The Meditation Courtyard shall follow the same arrangement.

**Regulations state:** The Refectory Hall should be built in a separate courtyard to the east, its size and dimensions determined by the time and circumstances. Doors and windows shall be positioned appropriately, with a curtained seat placed before the entrance. The Heavenly Worthy’s quarters to the left and right shall be furnished with beds, mats, and cushions, all arranged according to ritual. Before the Heavenly Worthy, incense burners, banners, flowers, and clean cloths shall be set, along with food tables and cushions, all prepared in full accordance with the rites.

**Regulations state:** The Refectory Kitchen should be adjacent to the dining hall, with cauldrons, stoves, and granaries arranged to serve the needs of the refectory, ensuring nothing is lacking.

**Regulations state:** Within the abbey, the Sutra-Copying Workshop must be built first, established in a separate courtyard, not to be shared with laypeople. If space is limited, a small chamber or veranda may suffice. It shall include a Sutra-Collating Hall, a bathing room, a stove for boiling water, a paper-preparation area, and tools such as mallets, knives for cutting and trimming, as well as clean towels and robes for bathing, incense for fumigating scriptures, and stands for displaying them. Mortars, pestles, and all necessary implements shall be placed within the workshop. Every aspect must be kept pure, never mingled with the profane or defiled by the mundane. Neglect in preparation is the greatest taboo.

**Regulations state:** Within the abbey, a Bathing Hall must be constructed, even in private quarters of separate courtyards, for this is of utmost urgency. Before performing rituals, reciting scriptures, ascending the altar, entering meditation, making petitions, offering repentance, or confessing transgressions—whether defiled by worldly dust or having violated the true precepts, whether soiled by filth or stained by grime—even the slightest impurity offends the spirit officials. To transgress against the immortals is to deviate from the true qi. Thus, one must bathe and purify body and mind, ensuring a fragrant and pristine state before proceeding. Therefore, on days of ritual practice, one must bathe in fragrant waters. All necessities for bathing—cauldrons, wells, stoves, beds, mats, and fragrant powders—shall be fully prepared.

**Regulations state:** The Meditation Courtyard is intended to seclude one from noise and defilement, maintaining purity and stillness. It must be established in a separate courtyard, situated in a secluded and tranquil location, with its orientation, distance, and dimensions determined by the time and convenience. It shall include a Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, a meditation chamber for refining qi, a bathing room, and a medicine hall, with all necessities for the master fully provided, ensuring nothing is lacking.

**Regulations state:** The Terraces and Pavilions for Seeking the True, Refining Qi, Praying to the True, Absorbing the Scenery, Scattering Flowers, Gazing at Immortals, Receiving Dew, the Nine Clarities, Wandering Immortals, Concentrating Spirit, Riding Clouds, Flying Simurgh, Extending Spirit, Welcoming Wind, the Nine Immortals, Extending the True, Dancing Phoenix, Carefree, Silent Contemplation, and the Nine Perfected—all are where Daoists and female adepts ascend the cloud paths in aspiration, soar the starry roads in sincerity, wander beyond the mundane in thought, and gaze upon the mortal realm. They hope for the Eight Sceneries to descend and the Ten Immortals to gather, for these are no ordinary affairs and must be set apart. They should be near the Meditation Courtyard or built in separate courtyards, arranged to shield from wind and dew, allowing clouds and mist to pass freely. They should overlook the celestial river, gaze upon the stars’ paths, open the four gates of the seasons, and unbar the eight windows of the winds, so that immortal chariots may come and go, and true riders may pass through. The higher and more expansive they are, the more they invite the eternal—where one may clasp hands with the immortals and brush sleeves at dawn and dusk.

**Regulations state:** The Gate of Myriad Mysteries, the Path of Coming and Going, the Portal of the Host of Perfected—these are the avenues of entry and exit. They are to the abbey as the eyes are to the face, indispensable.

All abbey gates must be constructed with pavilions or towers above, where the abbey’s inscribed plaque is mounted to mark their prominence. The number of tiers and their size may vary with the occasion, while the two or three subsidiary gates below depend on the resources available—whether lavish or modest.

Every separate courtyard must be established with appropriate adornment and carving, each designed to suit its purpose, without rigid adherence to fixed conventions.

**Regulations state:** On either side of the abbey’s main gate, separate gates for carriages, horses, oxen, and donkeys must be opened, ensuring no passage through the central gate.

**Regulations state:** The master’s quarters shall be arranged around the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy on all four sides, with the number of rooms and structures determined by the scale of construction at the time.

**Regulations state:** When Daoists or female Daoist adepts enter the Dao, they must receive and uphold the scriptures, precepts, talismans, and registers. A separate Ordination Courtyard must be built, complete with an altar, a refectory, and quiet chambers—all essentials for the ritual must be provided within this courtyard.

**Regulations state:** Upon the death of a Daoist or female Daoist adept, a separate Ascension Courtyard must be established, containing a hall and a chamber, with all necessary furnishings and implements provided within.

**Regulations state:** When a Daoist or female Daoist adept passes away, the community must perform rites of deliverance together. Near the Ascension Courtyard, a Fragrant Incense Courtyard should be built, furnished with tables, mats, beds, and seats—all requisites must be prepared within.

**Regulations state:** Before the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, an earthen platform must be constructed, or bricks and stones may be laid. If a wooden altar is built, it may have three, five, or up to twelve tiers, all following the scriptural prescriptions. Railings, inscribed gates, and plaques must conform to proper ritual standards.

**Regulations state:** All halls, pavilions, terraces, and adjoining courtyards must be enclosed with covered walkways—ambulatories, verandas, and galleries—ensuring they encircle the structures on all sides.

**Regulations state:** The quarters for lay attendants must be established in a separate courtyard, with their own gates, wells, and hearths. None of these may adjoin the master’s quarters. Visiting guests must also be lodged in separate quarters.

**Regulations state:** Carriages, oxen, mules, and horses must be housed near the lay attendants’ quarters in a separate enclosure, ensuring they do not share space with the master’s quarters or the refectory courtyard, and must remain near wells and hearths.

**Regulations state:** When Daoists from other regions arrive at the abbey—whether for ritual purposes or personal matters—their attendants and livestock must be accommodated separately, not alongside the resident masters. A separate Guest Courtyard must be established. If no such courtyard exists, they may be lodged in the lay attendants’ quarters, while donkeys and mules are placed in the donkey and mule enclosure. Any damage to the abbey’s property must be fully compensated and not treated as equivalent to the resident community’s usage.

**Regulations state:** When secular guests, disciples, or local officials visit, they must be lodged in a separate Lay Courtyard. Their attendants and livestock must not encroach upon or damage the abbey’s property; if they redeem their stay, they may remain.

**Regulations state:** Medicinal herbs, essential for healing, must be cultivated in a separate medicinal garden, using locally available plants.

**Regulations state:** Before offering flowers and fruits, the abbey’s inner and outer courtyards, as well as the walkways and chambers, must be planted with flowers, fruits, and rare herbs. These are to be harvested in season and offered to the Three Treasures.

**Regulations state:** Vegetables, essential for the refectory, must be cultivated—excluding the five pungent plants—along with seasonal greens, melons, gourds, and the like.

**Regulations state:** Granges, mills, and grinding stones, which sustain the abbey, must be sought and established according to proper methods wherever suitable. The distinction between purity and impurity must be observed, and all operations must be supervised to ensure they are conducted appropriately.

**Regulations state:** Those who leave the household life must cultivate simplicity, rejecting arrogance and extravagance, and embracing frugality. Their dwellings must not be ornate or lavish. Beds, mats, utensils, and furnishings must be plain and unadorned, avoiding worldly ostentation. Inner and outer spaces must remain unobstructed, without curtains, screens, or veils to conceal their simple rope beds. Dust whisks, ruyi scepters, incense burners, and ritual implements must always be kept at hand. All non-ritual objects, frivolous adornments, or playthings must not be kept—this is a grave precept for Daoists.

**Regulations state:** Every abbey must establish a separate courtyard with proper structures for the preparation of offerings, construction of Heavenly Worthy statues, and other meritorious works. Bathing rooms, cauldrons, and hearths must all be provided within.

**Regulations state:** In the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy, all separate courtyards, and private chambers—both inside and out—fruit trees, flowering plants, green bamboo, clear ponds, rare herbs, and fragrant flowers must be planted, arranged along steps and pathways to adorn the halls. The foliage should shade the chambers, allowing fragrant breezes to rise, wisdom’s sun to shine, and songbirds to sing, occasionally drawing the presence of exalted immortals. Above, it should resemble the Jade Terrace; below, it should mirror the Golden Gate—where the heart finds its true abode.

**Scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure: The Three Caverns’ Regulations for Upholding the Dao and Precepts—Construction, Scroll One (Conclusion)**

**Scriptures of the Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure: The Three Caverns’ Regulations for Upholding the Dao and Precepts—Construction, Scroll Two**

**Chapter Five: On the Creation of Images**

**Regulations state:** The Great Image is formless; the Utmost Real is colorless. Profound and still, beyond sight and sound, it manifests in response, briefly appearing before vanishing. To preserve the true, one must fix the mind upon the sacred countenance. Thus, with cinnabar, azure, gold, and jade, the forms are depicted—images of the true visage adorned with lead and powder. For all who focus their devotion, the creation of images comes first.

There are six types of images to be reverently crafted:

1. First, the supreme Dharma King, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Unsurpassed Dao; the Supreme Jade Clarity of the Great Dao; and the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One.
2. Second, the infinite sagely and immortal forms of the Three Clarities, from the Great Network below to the Grand Purity above.
3. Third, the boundless sagely forms of past, present, and future.
4. Fourth, the true and immortal forms of the celestial bodies and constellations.
5. Fifth, the countless sagely and immortal forms of the various ranks.
6. Sixth, the infinite sacred and true forms that respond to karmic conditions.

For those who aspire to this, there are eighteen methods to depict the true countenance:

1. Carved from precious materials such as jade, quartz, coral, and the seven treasures.
2. Cast in yellow gold.
3. Cast in white silver.
4. Cast in red copper.
5. Cast in black iron.
6. Cast in tin or lead.
7. Carved from fragrant woods such as plum, sandalwood, and aloeswood.
8. Woven.
9. Embroidered.
10. Molded from clay.
11. Made using the *jiāzhù* (lacquered cloth) technique.
12. Painted on plain silk.
13. Painted on walls.
14. Carved into niches.
15. Engraved on inscribed stones.
16. Erected as steles.
17. Imprinted with fragrant clay.
18. Imprinted on paper, molded from clay, carved from tiles, polished bone, sculpted ivory, carved wood, shaped from snow, or drawn in ash.

A single thought of devotion brings boundless merit. Whether one inch, two inches, three, four, or five inches—even up to a foot—size is unrestricted, and quantity unlimited. Extending to one foot, two feet, three, four, or five feet, or even a *zhang*; one *zhang*, two, three, four, five, or six *zhang*; a hundred feet, a thousand feet, ten thousand feet; one hall, ten halls, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand halls; one niche, ten niches, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand niches; one scroll, ten scrolls, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand scrolls; one pedestal, ten pedestals, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand pedestals; one chamber, ten chambers, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand chambers; one hall, ten halls, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand halls—even to vast numbers beyond reckoning. Whether one Celestial Venerable, two, or up to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or numbers beyond measure; along with Perfected Ones, Immortals, Sages, Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, the various Celestial Sovereigns, Diamond Divine Kings, Fragrance Officials, Attendants of Incense, Dragons and Tigers, Lions, Apotropaic Spirits, halls and canopied thrones, banners and floral streamers, flying celestials and heavenly music, and all manner of attendants—each may be offered according to one’s devotion, with reverence, prostrations, incense burning, and day-and-night contemplation as if in the presence of the true form. From past to future, the merit gained is immeasurable, and the true Dao is thereby perfected.

**Regulations state:** All images must follow the scriptures. Their forms and attributes must be complete: the Celestial Venerable possesses five hundred billion marks, the Dao Lord seventy-two marks, Lord Lao thirty-two marks, and Perfected Ones twenty-four marks. Robes, crowns, and ornate pedestals must all conform to the proper method. The Celestial Venerable’s upper mantle should be of nine-colored *li luo* silk or five-colored clouds, mist, mountains, and waters, paired with brocade or yellow lower garments, and a gold or jade crown. The attendants on either side should wear pendants, sashes, and jade or gold crowns, with colors interwoven—yet the upper mantle must never be purely purple, cinnabar, indigo, or green. Perfected Ones must not be depicted with unbound hair, elongated ears, or single horns; they must wear lotus, flying-cloud, or Primordial Beginning crowns, and never the *Er Yi Ping* crown or deer-antler headdresses. The two Perfected Ones on either side should be shown making offerings, holding scriptures or tablets, or bearing various fragrant flowers, all with solemn reverence. They must not appear lax in posture or with disordered robes. The Celestial Venerable sits in equanimity, fingers forming the *Tai Wu* mudra, hands empty—never holding a *ruyi* scepter, whisk, or fly-whisk.

**Regulations state:** To the left and right of the Celestial Venerable, Dao Lord, and Lord Lao, there should be Perfected Ones, Jade Lads, Jade Maidens, Attendants of Incense, Attendants of Scriptures, Fragrance Officials, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Left and Right Official Envoys, Celestial Soldiers, Diamond Divine Kings, Lions, Apotropaic Spirits, Dragon-Unicorns, Fierce Beasts, *Tengshe* Serpents, Divine Tigers, Phoenixes, Peacocks, Vermilion Birds of Gold Wings, the Four Spirits and Eight Mighties, and Dharma-protecting benevolent spirits, all arrayed as guardians according to one’s means.

**Regulations state:** The names of Perfected Ones are innumerable, for they are those who planted the causes in past kalpas and attained the fruits of the Dao, standing beside the Celestial Venerable, Dao Lord, and Lord Lao to serve, protect, and transmit petitions. Their transformations are effortless, and wherever the Celestial Venerable resides, they attend as guardians.

**Regulations state:** Jade Lads and Jade Maidens are born of the Dao’s *qi*, not through wombs. Each has their appointed duties—some attend scriptures or incense, others scatter flowers or deliver messages, serve immortals, or attend those who have attained the Dao. Their ranks and grades vary accordingly.

**Regulations state:** Attendants of Scriptures and Attendants of Incense are born of coalesced *qi* and remain constantly in the presence of the Celestial Venerable and true scriptures, transmitting petitions, circulating teachings, and recording good and evil deeds.

**Regulations state:** The Diamond Divine Kings are the four extreme gods of Heaven, standing at the four corners of the celestial realm or at the gates and thresholds of Heaven and Earth. Each is one thousand two hundred *zhang* tall, wielding swords and staves, clad in celestial robes and flying-cloud crowns, treading upon great mountains, divine beasts, boulders, and various ghosts. They assume a stance of slaying demons, governing all unlawful spirits of Heaven and Earth. With glaring eyes and thunderous voices, they subdue malevolent beings. Wherever the Celestial Venerable’s central abode or halls are located, their images should stand to guard and protect, transforming without fixed form. They are born of the Dao’s fierce *qi*, not through wombs. In present-day temples, their images are placed at gates, halls, and scripture repositories.

**Regulations state:** Divine Kings are the lords of all spirits, and there are three kinds: those born of coalesced *qi*, those born as karmic retribution, and those born of karmic causes. Those born of coalesced *qi* arise from natural energy, not wombs. Those born as karmic retribution descend from spirits who rendered service to the Dao and thus attained this form. Those born of karmic causes inherit their roles through accumulated kalpic conditions and are tasked with oversight. All who attain perfection and the Dao come under their supervision. The names of Divine Kings are likewise innumerable. They wear armor and crowns, wield spears, hold swords, or rest their hands upon them, standing or sitting without fixed form. They command legions of ghosts, expel evil, and drive away malevolence. Their full attributes are detailed in the scriptures and will not be exhaustively listed here.

**Regulations state:** Demon Kings are also of the Divine King lineage, and there are three kinds: the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens, the Demon Kings of the Five Emperors, and the Flying Celestial Demon Kings. They all test, refine, and protect those who cultivate the Dao, for the Great Merit Demon King safeguards your person.

**Regulations state:** Celestial Soldiers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and Fragrance Officials are all born of *qi* and manifest in response to conditions. They subdue demons, summon ghosts, transmit messages, and serve as divine officials protecting the Dharma.

**Regulations state:** The Eight Fearsome Beasts are the Poisonous Dragon, Fierce Tiger, Flying Serpent, Lightning Beast, Long-Tusked Creature, Galloping Ox, Heavenly Ape, and Thunder Crystal. All are malevolent beings of accumulated karma, subdued by the majesty of the Heavenly Worthy to stand guard at gates and passes, patrol caves and walls, and prevent transgressions.

**Regulations state:** The Four Auspicious Beasts are the Tortoise, Dragon, Qilin, and Phoenix. Each corresponds to celestial constellations and extraordinary *qi*, embodying the essence of the Five Phases. Some recite sacred texts and bear talismanic markings upon their bodies, discerning the rise and fall of eras before descending into the world. They dwell within the Heavenly Worthy’s gardens as propitious birds and beasts.

**Regulations state:** The Dharma-thrones of the Heavenly Worthy comprise eight kinds:
1. The Thousand-Petaled Lotus,
2. The Five-Colored Lions,
3. The Seven-Treasured Golden Couch,
4. The Nine-Tiered Jade Seat,
5. The Subduer of Nine Dragons,
6. The Crusher of Eight Poisons,
7. The Cloud-Soaring Seat,
8. The Mist-and-Rosy-Clouds Throne.
All manifest in response to conditions and reside according to circumstance. Present-day canopied thrones, adorned with the seven treasures and eight rarities—pearls, jade, gold, and azure—are but imitations and not the true forms.

**Regulations state:** All images of the Heavenly Worthies, Dao Lords, Lao Lords, and the sacred countenances of perfected immortals, worn by time and weathered by wind and rain, must be repaired in due season. Never allow the true visages to decay or fall into disrepair, for boundless merit shall be attained thereby.

**Regulations state:** For images of the Heavenly Worthy wrought in gold, bronze, or precious jade, on every fifteenth day of the month, offer vegetarian feasts, incense, and fragrant water for cleansing. If the images are of lacquered cloth or carved wood, polish them until they gleam, for this yields the greatest merit.

**Scripture-Writing, Sixth Section**

**Regulations state:** Scriptures are the teachings bequeathed by sages, recorded and disseminated to exhort the heavens, give rise to sacred beings, awaken the Dao through study, and attain perfection through awakening. They ferry five hundred million heavenly beings across, instruct three thousand lands, serve as the path to transcendence, and provide the causal conditions for liberation. Eternally practiced, they are the eternal model of the Three Clarities, weaving the *qi* of soaring mystery and scattering the radiant chapters of the Great Purple. Some are phoenix-script or dragon-writing, jade texts or sacred talismans, each character a full *zhang* in size, with eight corners emitting rays, forming ten divisions. The profound principles of the Three Vehicles are stored in cloud-bound scrolls, sealed with rosy shoulders, dividing the Three Caverns by gate and distinguishing the Four Supplements by lineage. They are the divine medicine for heaven and humankind, the Dharma-bridge between life and death, enabling all beings to transcend the ford of the Five Turbidities and together ascend the shore of the Six Perfections.

There are twelve methods for creating true scriptures:
1. Inscribing on golden tablets,
2. Engraving on silver plates,
3. Carving on flat stone,
4. Writing on wood,
5. Brush on plain silk,
6. Brush with lacquer,
7. Characters in gold,
8. Characters in silver,
9. Bamboo slips,
10. Wall inscriptions,
11. Paper scrolls,
12. Leaf manuscripts.
Whether ancient or modern, seal-script or clerical, some emulate celestial jade characters or cloud-like golden texts, employing the eight scripts and six writings as the heart desires. Furthermore, they are divided into two categories: general and specific.

The **general** encompasses the entire Three Caverns’ treasure repository and exhausts the Four Supplements’ mysterious texts, employing all twelve methods above for comprehensive transcription and dissemination.

The **specific** may consist of a single character or sentence, a scroll or a bundle, transcribed and venerated according to one’s devotion. The writing must be exquisite, ink and paper resplendent, with proper mounting, scroll rods, and cases for storage. Burn incense, bow in reverence, and offer perpetual veneration, for the merit gained is immeasurable and inconceivable.

**Regulations state:** All scriptures must be housed in repositories. There are two kinds of repositories:
1. The **general repository**, where the Three Caverns and Four Supplements are combined into one, arranged in tiers above and below, or left and right, each level bearing the inscription *Three Caverns Treasure Scripture Repository*.
2. The **specific repository**, where the Three Caverns and Four Supplements each have their own. There are seven types:
   1. The *Great Cavern True Scripture Repository*,
   2. The *Cavern Mystery Treasure Scripture Repository*,
   3. The *Cavern Spirit Immortal Scripture Repository*,
   4. The *Great Mystery Scripture Repository*,
   5. The *Great Peace Scripture Repository*,
   6. The *Great Clarity Scripture Repository*,
   7. The *Orthodox Unity Scripture Repository*.
Each must be clearly labeled for distinction and arranged in order. Whether combined or separate, repositories should follow the same principles: place them on scripture platforms or within the Heavenly Worthy’s hall, in the central chamber’s left and right bays—Three Caverns to the left, Four Supplements to the right. Each repository must have a platform, never placed directly on the ground. Cover them with cloth and wrap them properly. Set out tables, incense burners, and jade dragon censers, burn incense, keep lamps lit, and maintain mindfulness, all with due reverence. The size of repositories depends on the circumstances and is not fixed.

**Ferrying Beings, Seventh Section**

**Regulations state:** The Dao is propagated through people, and teachings are transmitted by masters. Without ferrying beings, the Dharma-bridge and path would be severed. Thus, propagating the teachings begins with ferrying beings.

There are twelve types of individuals suitable for ordination:
1. Imperial children and heavenly descendants,
2. High ministers and chief advisors,
3. Empresses and imperial consorts,
4. The wise and intelligent,

9. Those diligent in practice and asceticism,
10. Those proficient in recitation and study,
11. The courageous and ardent,
12. All who possess the aspiration.

Select these twelve types to ordain and guide into monastic life, from a single individual to billions, to uphold and propagate the Dharma, spreading the scriptures and transmissions.

Additionally, there are twenty-five characteristics that qualify one for ordination:
1. A family lineage devoted to the Dao and faithful in scriptural practice,
2. Present life devotion to the Dao and faithful in scriptural practice,
3. Personal devotion to the Dao and faithful in scriptural practice,

11. Vows to propagate the Great Dao,
12. Aspiration to proclaim the scriptural teachings,
13. Long-standing practice of the Dao,
14. Purity of body and mind,
15. Absence of covetousness,
16. Absence of worldly attachments,
17. Absence of worldly competitiveness,
18. Absence of worldly contempt or arrogance,
19. Absence of worldly deceit or falsehood,
20. Absence of worldly praise or blame,
21. Single-minded aspiration to ordination,
22. Desire to ordain and uphold the Orthodox Dharma,
23. Desire to ordain and relinquish life, wealth, and all for the Dao,
24. Desire to ordain and establish great blessings for emperors, kings, lords, and all officials and people under heaven,
25. Desire to ordain and serve as a field of merit for all beings, expounding the Great Vehicle, dispelling ignorance, and guiding all to awakening.

There are also ten types of individuals who must not be permitted to leave the household life: first, those who betray their lords or rebel against their parents; second, those who harm or execute their descendants; third, those who kill their teachers or betray the Dao; fourth, those who disbelieve in the Great Dharma; fifth, those engaged in butchery, brewing, or lustful desires; sixth, those who steal, deceive, or act with cunning; seventh, those who consume alcohol or meat; eighth, those who do not recognize the consequences of sin and merit, past lives, or karmic conditions; ninth, those whose physical form is incomplete; tenth, those who are base, violent, or obstinate. Those possessing any of these ten traits must not be allowed to leave the household life, for they would harm the dignity of the Dao and destroy the teachings of the Dharma.

Furthermore, there are twenty-five characteristics that disqualify one from entering the Dao: first, those whose families slander and disbelieve the scriptural teachings; second, those who witness others slandering and disbelieving the scriptural teachings; third, those who themselves slander and disbelieve the scriptural teachings; fourth, those whose families are frivolous and insincere, failing to uphold the true and authentic; fifth, those who witness others being frivolous and insincere, failing to uphold the true and authentic; sixth, those who themselves are frivolous and insincere, failing to uphold the true and authentic; seventh, those who are gluttonous for alcohol and meat; eighth, those whose hearts do not revere the Dao; ninth, those who undermine the Great Dao; tenth, those who do not contemplate the scriptural teachings; eleventh, those who indulge in sensual desires; twelfth, those who obsess over worldly affairs; thirteenth, those whose bodies and minds are defiled and impure; fourteenth, those whose hearts harbor envy and rivalry; fifteenth, those whose hearts are filled with right and wrong; sixteenth, those who are attached to sounds and sights; seventeenth, those who harbor worldly competitiveness; eighteenth, those who harbor worldly contempt or arrogance; nineteenth, those who constantly act with deceit and falsehood; twentieth, those who constantly think of dissipation; twenty-first, those who lack the heart to uphold the Dharma; twenty-second, those who covet only worldly gains; twenty-third, those whose minds are scattered and unfocused; twenty-fourth, those who are lazy and careless; twenty-fifth, those who seek only their own benefit and not that of others. When assessing individuals for ordination, one must follow the regulations and make careful selections, ensuring they meet the criteria before permitting them to leave the household life. This may be done for the sake of emperors, kings, or lords; for heaven and earth, the sun and moon; for ancestral temples and altars of the soil and grain; for one’s parents or oneself; for one’s wife, children, and family; for the deceased or the living; upon ascending the throne or the birth of a child; for the unrest in the eight directions; for the suffering of the four kinds of sentient beings; for unseasonable winds and rains; for the misalignment of stars and constellations; for plagues and poisons afflicting the people; or for droughts and floods affecting crops. Among all fields of merit, ordaining others is supreme, and the merit of ordaining others is inconceivable.

The regulations state: All who leave the household life must possess thirty characteristics: first, they must constantly practice diligence and remain unstained by the world; second, they must constantly act with courage and never retreat from the Dao; third, they must constantly practice compassion and refrain from killing sentient beings; fourth, they must constantly act with pity and deliver all beings; fifth, they must constantly practice forbearance and harbor no anger; sixth, they must constantly act with joy and guide all beings; seventh, they must constantly generate good intentions and uphold the Three Treasures; eighth, they must constantly generate great aspirations and cultivate numinous contemplation; ninth, they must constantly generate great aspirations and propagate the scriptural teachings; tenth, they must constantly aspire to guide all beings and lead them to the true Dao; eleventh, they must constantly aspire to expound the Great Vehicle and awaken the ignorant; twelfth, they must constantly aspire to establish great blessings for emperors, kings, and lords; thirteenth, they must constantly aspire to serve as fields of merit for high ministers and great officials; fourteenth, they must constantly aspire to liberate all sentient beings from suffering; fifteenth, they must constantly aspire for the longevity of kings and the peace of their lands; sixteenth, they must constantly aspire for world peace and abundant harvests; seventeenth, they must constantly aspire for the widespread propagation of the scriptural teachings and universal awakening; eighteenth, they must constantly aspire for all beings in the world to turn toward the Great Dao; nineteenth, they must constantly uphold fasting and precepts, never retreating in thought; twentieth, they must constantly revere the scriptural teachings and cultivate practice in every moment; twenty-first, they must constantly face the Heavenly Worthy, burn incense, and perform the ritual circumambulation; twenty-second, they must widely transcribe and disseminate the scriptural teachings among the people; twenty-third, they must widely cultivate numinous contemplation and guide all to turn toward it; twenty-fourth, they must aspire for their Dharma-body to be firm and unwavering; twenty-fifth, they must widely create fields of merit to benefit all; twenty-sixth, they must widely practice alms-begging to cultivate various merits; twenty-seventh, they must widely generate compassion to deliver all beings; twenty-eighth, they must widely practice compassion and bestow kindness upon all; twenty-ninth, they must constantly uphold the Dharma’s forms and never abandon its dignity; thirtieth, they must universally liberate those in the three realms of hell with the supreme and wondrous Dharma, enabling them to ascend and forever escape the darkness of suffering. These thirty matters constitute the characteristics of one who has left the household life. They must constantly aspire, in the past, future, and present, to never retreat in thought, to always abide in the Dharma-body, to never rest or slacken, to uphold the Great Dao, and to create boundless blessings for all beings, so that all in the world—whether sentient or insentient, all beings—may attain the supreme Dao.

The regulations state: After Daoist priests and nuns leave the household life, they must first establish discipline to organize and uphold the Dharma’s teachings. There are five types to consider: first, those whose Daoist practice is pure and sincere, whose hearts constantly cultivate the Dharma, who do not seek personal gain, and who aspire to accomplishment; second, those who are honest and upright, who do not transgress against others, and who aspire to establish fields of merit; third, those whose virtue and conduct are lofty and far-reaching, who are well-versed in the Dharma’s teachings, who are revered by both Daoists and laity, and who possess skillful means; fourth, those who discern the times and circumstances, who adapt to the world without violating the scriptural teachings; fifth, those who are diligent and hardworking, who skillfully initiate and benefit the Dharma-gate. Only those possessing these five qualities may be established as disciplinarians to organize and uphold the Dharma’s teachings as a model for propagation. If any among them act in ways that harm the Dharma-gate, they must not be appointed. Furthermore, there are those who falsely assume virtuous conduct and seek personal gain—such individuals must never be appointed.

Moreover, there are those of sincere and earnest disposition who do not seek such positions—such individuals must be carefully assessed for their suitability.

There are also ten types of persons who must not be forcibly appointed:
First, those who do not believe in past lives, karmic retribution, or causal conditions;
second, those devoid of shame, who seek only personal gain;
third, those who rely on power and wealth, whose hearts do not benefit the multitude;
fourth, those whose thoughts and intentions harm the permanent endowments;
fifth, those who, in all their actions, constantly scheme with cunning;
sixth, those who neither understand the scriptures nor the precepts, and further, show no reverence;
seventh, those ignorant of worldly affairs, stubborn and self-willed;
eighth, those outwardly pure but inwardly defiled, outwardly foolish but inwardly cunning, outwardly true but inwardly false, outwardly upright but inwardly greedy, or whose words align with their lips but not their hearts;
ninth, those who neither harm nor benefit the community, yet falsely occupy positions within the Dharma;
tenth, those who, having attained a position within the Dharma, seek personal convenience, rely on their authority, and pursue private gain.

Those possessing any of these ten qualities may not hold such office. Should one disregard these standards and appoint those who curry favor or share personal bias, their lifespan shall be reduced by three thousand six hundred years.

The statutes further state: There are twenty-five principles that disciplinarians and Dharma-disciples must constantly uphold.
First, they must not covet the wealth of the Three Treasures with deceitful or oppressive intent;
second, they must not covet the communal property of the permanent endowments with deceitful or oppressive intent;
third, they must not covet the offerings of the fourfold assembly with deceitful or oppressive intent;
fourth, they must not treat the great and venerable elders with arrogance or neglect;
fifth, they must not treat their peers of middle years with arrogance or neglect;
sixth, they must not treat junior disciples or latecomers with arrogance or neglect;
seventh, they must not treat those of lowly status with arrogance or neglect;
eighth, they must personally uphold the precepts and statutes, ensuring their conduct does not violate them;
ninth, they must skillfully harmonize and reconcile superiors and subordinates with kindness;
tenth, they must employ skillful means to guide and instruct Dharma-disciples;
eleventh, they must deeply discern the opportune moments for all beneficial actions;
twelfth, their hearts must constantly abide in and sustain the Three Treasures;
thirteenth, they must never damage or destroy the permanent endowments;
fourteenth, they must not harbor resentment or attachment toward unrecognized offerings;
fifteenth, they must maintain impartiality toward all Dharma-assemblies;
sixteenth, they must not act arbitrarily in matters of common concern;
seventeenth, their hearts must be upright, harming nothing;
eighteenth, in all matters, their intentions must aim for fulfillment;
nineteenth, they must not misappropriate even the smallest portion of any property;
twentieth, they must always seek to benefit and adorn the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures;
twenty-first, they must skillfully adapt to circumstances, harmonize worldly affairs, and prevent the Three Treasures from being defamed or destroyed;
twenty-second, they must protect the Dharma-community, preventing external violations;
twenty-third, they must constantly teach the Dharma-community to follow the precepts and statutes;
twenty-fourth, they must earn the unwavering devotion of all, whether noble or base, inner or outer circles, from beginning to end;
twenty-fifth, they must broadly cultivate sincerity, fulfill the Dharma-gate, ensure it remains unbroken and undamaged, serve as an eternal field of merit, and establish a sanctuary of goodness for future beings.

The disciplinarians of the Dharma-gate who embody these twenty-five principles shall accumulate merit, enabling past, present, and future generations to obtain boundless blessings.

The statutes further state: There are thirty prohibitions that disciplinarians of the Dharma-gate must vigilantly guard against in overseeing the permanent endowments.
First, they must not constantly covet the wealth of the Three Treasures with deceitful or oppressive intent;
second, they must not constantly covet the communal property of the permanent endowments with deceitful or oppressive intent;
third, they must not constantly covet the offerings of the fourfold assembly with deceitful or oppressive intent;
fourth, they must not habitually treat the great and venerable elders with arrogance or neglect;
fifth, they must not habitually treat their peers of middle years with arrogance or neglect;
sixth, they must not habitually treat junior disciples or latecomers with arrogance or neglect;
seventh, they must not violate the precepts and statutes in their conduct;
eighth, they must not fail to harmonize superiors and subordinates;
ninth, they must not fail to guide and instruct Dharma-disciples;
tenth, they must not lack skillful means in beneficial actions;
eleventh, their hearts must not waver from sustaining the Three Treasures;
twelfth, they must not constantly seek to damage or destroy the permanent endowments;
thirteenth, they must not resent criticism or harbor partiality;
fourteenth, their hearts must not be biased toward any Dharma-assembly;
fifteenth, they must not act arbitrarily in matters of common concern;
sixteenth, they must not be deceitful or act with false pretense;
seventeenth, their intentions in all matters must not remain unfulfilled;
eighteenth, they must not take even the smallest portion of any property;
nineteenth, they must not fail to benefit the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures, seeking only personal gain;
twentieth, they must not be ignorant of circumstances, act contrary to worldly affairs, allow external forces to encroach, or damage the Three Treasures;
twenty-first, they must not fail to protect the Dharma-community, thereby increasing lawlessness;
twenty-second, they must not neglect to teach Dharma-disciples, allowing frequent violations of the precepts and statutes;
twenty-third, they must not disrupt the devotion of inner and outer circles, whether noble or base;
twenty-fourth, their intentions must not waver, lacking constancy;
twenty-fifth, their hearts must not be biased or crooked, preventing fulfillment and causing the Dharma-gate to be destroyed and the fields of merit to be lost;
twenty-sixth, they must not rely on the powerful and wealthy to manage or trade the properties of the Three Treasures;
twenty-seventh, they must not exploit the Dharma-gate for personal fame and profit, defiling the scriptural teachings;
twenty-eighth, they must not abuse the authority of the Three Treasures to indulge in disputes;
twenty-ninth, upon hearing criticism, they must not persist in wrongdoing;
thirtieth, they must not encroach upon or damage the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures while indulging their own desires.

Should one violate any of these thirty prohibitions, in future lives they shall be reborn among birds and beasts, subject to being killed or spared at others’ whim, forever losing the human realm. In this life, they shall be blind, deaf, mute, crippled, or deformed, their bodies incomplete. Daoist priests and nuns must clearly recognize these statutes and precepts, abide by them, and never transgress.

The statutes further state: All Daoist priests and nuns who serve as disciplinarians must adhere to the Dharma in their conduct, diligently proclaim the statutes and precepts, and instruct their disciples.

Should any violate these statutes, they shall be penalized according to the Dharma by offering incense and oil, striking the bell, and performing prostrations. If they repeat the offense without repentance, they shall be assigned heavier labor. Should they be tasked with maintaining the abbey’s structures yet remain defiant and unyielding, they shall be disciplined by the statutes, expelled, and returned to their original master. The aim is to guide the foolish toward the Dao, ensuring they do not transgress the statutes and precepts, all the while upholding rectitude without partiality, lest they disrupt and disorder the sacred canons. Those who violate this shall have their lifespan reduced by two thousand four hundred years.

**Section Eight: Ritual Implements**

The statutes state: All ritual implements are the foundation of a Daoist priest’s or nun’s dignity and deportment, indispensable before offerings are made. Whether stored in the abbey or within private quarters for veneration, all scriptures and sacred objects are collectively termed *ritual implements*.

The statutes state: The bell is the assembly point for the Four Communities and an urgent necessity for the six periods of the day. Should this instrument be lacking, the Dharma gatherings shall deviate from proper order. As the scriptures say: *"At the long fast in the Mystic Capital, jade is struck and chimes of quartz ring forth."* And again: *"The Dharma drum summons the host of immortals, their divine chants harmonizing without discord."* There are five types of bells to be crafted:
1. Gold bells,
2. Silver bells,
3. Bells cast from an alloy of five metals,
4. Bronze bells,
5. Iron bells.

They may have nine, eight, four, or two corners, or none at all. Some are vast enough to hold ten thousand *dan*, others as small as a single *dou*, each suited to its time. Once forged, all must be inscribed with the reign title, year, commandery, county, abbey name, and the purpose of their creation, ensuring they endure for ten thousand generations and remain in use through the six periods of the day.

The statutes state: The chime-stone serves to regulate dignity and deportment, essential for proper bearing. There are six types:
1. Jade,
2. Gold,
3. Silver,
4. Bronze,
5. Iron,
6. Stone.

They may have two, four, or nine corners, or none, or be shaped like a hook. All must be engraved with identifying marks to serve as permanent offerings. Bells and chime-stones must be suspended from stands.

The statutes state: In the halls of the Heavenly Worthy and all places where scriptures and images are enshrined, one must fashion canopies, altars, banners, and adornments; palanquins, incense burners, floral ornaments, sashes, tables, silk veils, banner poles, lampstands, candleholders, lanterns, altar ropes, gate placards, incense boxes, and all manner of ritual implements. These may be of brocade, embroidered silk, gold and jade inlay, kingfisher feathers, peacock plumes, cinnabar and azure pigments, pearls and jade, glass and tortoiseshell, inlaid with the Seven Treasures and Nine Radiant Lights, adorned with the Three Clarities and Six Emanations—resplendent, pure, and varied, all in accordance with proper form. To offer these to the Heavenly Worthy is to cultivate eternal merit; not a single item may be lacking. Their creation is deemed the highest virtue.

The statutes state: There are twenty-one types of banners:
1. Linked gold,
2. Strung jade,
3. Beaded,
4. Silver-threaded,
5. Embroidered silk,
6. Woven,
7. Assorted brocade,
8. Various gauzes,
9. Colored patterns,
10. Carved,
11. Knotted silk,
12. Braided threads,
13. Cloud and mist,
14. Transformative script,
15. Threadwork,
16. Solid color,
17. Variegated color,
18. Dyed and painted,
19. Inscribed,
20. Five colors,
21. Nine colors.

They may be long or short, wide or narrow, three, five, seven, or nine *chi*, one or two *zhang*, forty-nine *chi*, a hundred *chi*, or a thousand *chi* in length. They may have one, two, ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand heads, all according to what the occasion allows. For the deceased, there are banners for guiding the spirit, transforming the soul, and delivering the living from the Nine Heavens and Three Paths. For the sick, there are banners for averting calamity, dispelling misfortune, extending life, and preserving destiny. For households in ordinary times, there are banners for attracting blessings, prolonging good fortune, ensuring annual protection, and increasing lifespan. Crafted according to one’s means, they are to be hung from tall poles in courtyards, beside scriptures and images, or along the corridors and within the abbey’s precincts, wherever veneration is due.

The statutes state: There are fifteen types of incense burners:
1. Carved jade,
2. Cast gold,
3. Pure silver,
4. *Tou* stone,
5. Cast bronze,
6. Wrought iron,
7. Seven Treasures,
8. Carved wood,
9. Painted,
10. Pure lacquer,
11. Porcelain,
12. Earthenware,
13. Stone,
14. Bamboo,
15. Seasonal materials.

All vary in size according to their time, adorned with soaring phoenixes, coiling dragons, swirling clouds, or misty vapors; or with thousand-petaled lotus blossoms atop fragrant mountains; or with raised carvings; or left plain and unadorned. They may have three, six, or nine legs, or a single leg, each suited to its purpose.

The statutes state: There are eight types of ritual cloths and veils:
1. Assorted brocade,
2. Assorted gauze,
3. Assorted damask,
4. Woven,
5. Embroidered,
6. Colored patterns,
7. Solid color,
8. Painted.

All vary in size according to their time, their length determined by design. They may be adorned with gold tracery, hanging jade, strings of pearls, or floral embellishments, then stored in boxes or cabinets to protect them from heat and damp.

The statutes state: For every scripture, whether five or ten fascicles, the karmic retribution of past kalpas is borne by those who physically maintain them. All who attain perfection and Daoist realization come to oversee and deliver them. The names of the divine kings are innumerable; clad in armor, crowned, wielding spears, swords at their belts, they stand or sit, their forms ever-changing. They command legions of spirits, driving away evil and malevolence. The details are recorded in the scriptures and will not be elaborated here.

The statutes state: The demon kings are also of the divine kings’ kind, and there are three types.

The three types of demon kings are: first, the Demon Kings of the Three Heavens; second, the Demon Kings of the Five Emperors; and third, the Flying Celestial Demon Kings. All test and refine those who uphold precepts, cultivate practice, and aspire to study the Dao, for the great merit of the demon kings is to safeguard and elevate such practitioners.

The statutes state: Heavenly soldiers, celestial warriors, dragon-and-tiger attendants, and incense officials—all arise through the transformation of qi, manifesting in response to karmic conditions. They subdue demons, summon spirits, transmit messages, and swiftly carry out commands, serving as divine officials who protect the Dharma.

The statutes state: The Eight Mighty Beasts are the poisonous dragon, the fierce tiger, the flying serpent, the lightning beast, the long-fanged creature, the charging ox, the celestial ape, and the thunder crystal. All are malevolent beings accumulated through past deeds, subdued by the majesty of the Heavenly Worthy and made to guard gates, passes, caves, and walls to prevent transgressions.

The statutes state: The Four Auspicious Beasts are the tortoise, the dragon, the qilin, and the phoenix. All correspond to celestial constellations and extraordinary qi, embodying the essence of the Five Agents. Some recite sacred texts, some bear talismanic inscriptions upon their bodies, some discern the rise and fall of eras, and some descend into the world in accordance with the times. All are divine creatures of the Heavenly Worthy’s celestial gardens.

The statutes state: Every Dharma throne of the Heavenly Worthy comprises eight types. The first is the thousand-petaled lotus; the second, the five-colored lions; the third, the seven-jeweled golden couch; the fourth, the nine-tiered jade seat; the fifth, the nine subdued dragons; the sixth, the crusher of the eight poisons; the seventh, the seat amid clouds and empyrean; and the eighth, the chariot of mist and rosy dawn. All assume forms in accordance with transformations, residing where conditions arise. Today’s canopied thrones merely imitate these with seven treasures, eight rarities, pearls, jade, gold, and azure—far from the true essence.

The statutes state: All images of the Heavenly Worthies, Dao Lords, Lao Lords, and the sacred perfected immortals, when aged by time, damaged by wind and rain, or worn by dampness, must be repaired in due course. Never allow the true visages to decay or fall into disrepair, for the merit thus accrued is boundless.

The statutes state: For all images of the Heavenly Worthy made of gold, bronze, or precious jade, on the fifteenth day of each month, arrange a vegetarian feast and bathe them with fragrant water. If the images are of lacquered cloth or carved wood, wipe them until they gleam, for this yields the greatest merit.

**Scripture Writing, Ninth Section**
The statutes state: Scriptures are the teachings bequeathed by sages, records transmitted to spread the Dharma, exhorting the heavens, giving rise to sacred beings. Through scriptures, one awakens to the Dao; through awakening, one attains perfection. They open the path to deliver five hundred million heavenly beings, instructing three thousand lands, serving as the road to transcendence and the karmic cause for liberation from the world. Ever-abiding through the ages, they are the eternal model of the Three Clarities, weaving the qi of soaring mystery and dispersing the radiant chapters of the Great Purple. Some are phoenix-script or dragon-writ, jade texts or sacred talismans—characters a zhang square, with eight-cornered rays, forming ten divisions. The profound principles of the Three Vehicles are stored in cloud-bound scrolls, wrapped in rosy sleeves, with the Three Caverns divided by gates and the Four Supplements distinguished by lineages. They are the celestial medicine for humans, the Dharma bridge between life and death, enabling all beings to universally transcend the ford of the Five Turbidities and together ascend the shore of the Six Perfections. Scriptures manifest in twelve forms to create true scriptures: first, inscriptions on golden tablets; second, seal script on silver plates; third, engravings on flat stone; fourth, characters on wood; fifth, writing on plain silk; sixth, lacquer writing; seventh, golden characters; eighth, silver characters; ninth, bamboo slips; tenth, wall inscriptions; eleventh, paper writing; and twelfth, leaf writing. Whether ancient or modern, seal or clerical script, whether adopting celestial jade characters or emulating cloud-borne golden texts—eight scripts and six writings—all follow the heart’s desire. Furthermore, they are categorized into two gates: general and specific. The general encompasses the entire Three Caverns’ treasure repository and exhausts the Four Supplements’ mysterious texts, employing all twelve forms to transcribe and circulate them. The specific involves writing a single character or phrase, a fascicle or a bundle, according to one’s original intent, widely transcribing and venerating them. The writing must be exquisite, paper and ink fresh and bright, the mounting and scrolls well-crafted, the cases and boxes properly stored. Burning incense and prostrating in worship, offering them for kalpas without end—such merit is boundless and inconceivable.

The statutes state: All scriptures must be housed in repositories. There are two types of repositories: first, the general repository; second, the specific repository. The general repository combines the Three Caverns and Four Supplements into one, arranged in tiers above and below, or left and right, front and back, each bearing the title *Repository of the Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures*. The specific repository separates the Three Caverns and Four Supplements into individual repositories, comprising seven types: first, the *Repository of the Great Cavern’s True Scriptures*; second, the *Repository of the Cavern Mystery’s Treasure Scriptures*; third, the *Repository of the Cavern Spirit’s Immortal Scriptures*; fourth, the *Repository of the Great Mystery’s Scriptures*; fifth, the *Repository of the Great Peace’s Scriptures*; sixth, the *Repository of the Great Clarity’s Scriptures*; and seventh, the *Repository of the Orthodox Unity’s Scriptures*. Each must be clearly labeled to distinguish them, and they should be arranged in order. For individual repositories, follow the method of the combined repository: place them on scripture platforms, either in the Heavenly Worthy’s hall or in the central chamber’s left and right bays—Three Caverns on the left, Four Supplements on the right. Each repository must have a platform to elevate it; they may not be placed directly on the ground. Cover them with cloths and bundles as prescribed. Set out tables, incense burners, and dragon-shaped jade censers to burn incense, with bright lamps to maintain mindfulness—all must be properly arranged. The size of the repositories depends on the circumstances of the time and is not fixed.

**Delivering Beings, Tenth Section**
The statutes state: The Dao is propagated by people, and teachings are transmitted through masters. Without delivering beings, the Dharma bridge and path would be severed; thus, propagating the teachings begins with delivering beings. There are twelve types of beings to be delivered: first, the children of emperors and celestial beings; second, great ministers and chief advisors; third, empresses and imperial consorts; fourth, the intelligent and wise; fifth, those of keen perception and quick understanding; sixth, wealthy men and women; seventh, those of dignified and solemn appearance; eighth, the benevolent, trustworthy, and sincere; ninth, those who practice diligently and endure hardship; tenth, those who recite and study scriptures with mastery; eleventh, the courageous and diligent; and twelfth, all who possess the aspiration. From these twelve, select those to be delivered and leave the household life. From a single person to a hundred million, they will uphold and propagate the Dharma, proclaiming and spreading the scriptures and transmissions.

Moreover, there are twenty-five signs by which one may be permitted to leave the household life:

First, those whose families have long revered the Dao and delighted in the scriptures and Dharma;
second, those who in this present life revere the Dao and delight in the scriptures and Dharma;
third, those who themselves revere the Dao and delight in the scriptures and Dharma;
fourth, those whose families are pure and good, faithfully upholding the true and real;
fifth, those who in this present life are pure and good, faithfully upholding the true and real;
sixth, those who themselves are pure and good, faithfully upholding the true and real;
seventh, those whose mastery of the scriptures is outstanding;
eighth, those whose practice is diligent and arduous;
ninth, those who refine their qi and abstain from grains;

fourteenth, those whose bodies and minds are pure;
fifteenth, those without covetous or envious hearts;
sixteenth, those without attachment to worldly loves;
seventeenth, those without worldly thoughts of victory or defeat;
eighteenth, those without worldly thoughts of hatred or contempt;
nineteenth, those without worldly thoughts of deceit or falsehood;
twentieth, those without worldly thoughts of slander or praise;
twenty-first, those whose every thought and intention is only to leave the household life;
twenty-second, those who wish to leave the household life to uphold and propagate the true Dharma;
twenty-third, those who wish to leave the household life, offering their bodies, lives, and wealth solely to the Dao;
twenty-fourth, those who wish to leave the household life to establish great blessings and benefits for emperors, kings, lords of states, and all officials and people under heaven and on earth;
twenty-fifth, those who wish to leave the household life to serve as fields of blessing for all beings in the cycle of birth and death, to expound the Great Vehicle, to widely dispel ignorance and darkness, and to enable all to awaken to the Dao.

Furthermore, there are ten types who must not be permitted to leave the household life:
first, disloyal subjects and unfilial children;
second, those whose descendants have been executed;
third, those who kill their teachers or betray the Dao;
fourth, those who do not believe in the Great Dharma;
fifth, butchers, wine-sellers, and the lustful;
sixth, thieves, deceivers, and frauds;
seventh, those who drink alcohol and eat meat;
eighth, those who do not understand the causes and conditions of sin and blessing, past lives and future destinies;
ninth, those whose physical forms are incomplete;
tenth, all who are wicked and obstinate.

Those possessing these ten traits must not be permitted to leave the household life, for they would harm the dignity of the Dao and destroy the Dharma and its teachings.

Additionally, there are twenty-five signs unsuited for entering the Dao:
first, those whose families have slandered and disbelieved the scriptures and Dharma;
second, those who in this present life slander and disbelieve the scriptures and Dharma;
third, those who themselves slander and disbelieve the scriptures and Dharma;
fourth, those whose families are frivolous and false, not upholding the true and real;
fifth, those who in this present life are frivolous and false, not upholding the true and real;
sixth, those who themselves are frivolous and false, not upholding the true and real;
seventh, those who are addicted to alcohol and meat;
eighth, those whose hearts do not revere the Dao;
ninth, those who destroy the Great Dao;
tenth, those who do not cherish the scriptures and Dharma;
eleventh, those who indulge in sensual desires;
twelfth, those who are preoccupied with worldly affairs;
thirteenth, those whose bodies and minds are defiled and evil;
fourteenth, those whose hearts are covetous and envious;
fifteenth, those whose hearts harbor right and wrong;
sixteenth, those who are attached to sounds and forms;
seventeenth, those who harbor worldly thoughts of victory or defeat;
eighteenth, those who harbor worldly thoughts of hatred or contempt;
nineteenth, those who constantly harbor deceit and falsehood;
twentieth, those who constantly think of dissipation;
twenty-first, those without the heart to revere the Dharma;
twenty-second, those who only covet worldly gains;
twenty-third, those whose minds are scattered and unfocused;
twenty-fourth, those who are lazy and careless;
twenty-fifth, those who seek only their own benefit and not that of others.

When delivering beings, one must follow the regulations and make careful selections, ensuring they conform to the Dharma before permitting them to leave the household life. This may be done for the sake of rulers, emperors, or kings; for heaven and earth, the sun and moon; for ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain; for parents or oneself; for wives, children, and family members; for the deceased or the living; for those newly enthroned or newly born; for the unrest in the eight directions; for the sentient beings among the four kinds of birth; for unseasonable winds and rains; for the disorder of stars and constellations; for plagues and poisons afflicting the people; or for droughts and floods affecting crops.

Among all fields of blessing, delivering beings is supreme. The merit of delivering beings is inconceivable.

The regulations state: In leaving the household life, there are thirty signs:
first, constantly practicing diligence without worldly defilements;
second, constantly practicing courage without retreating from the Dao;
third, constantly practicing compassion without killing living beings;
fourth, constantly practicing empathy and delivering all kinds of beings;
fifth, constantly practicing forbearance without harboring anger;
sixth, constantly practicing joy and guiding all;
seventh, constantly generating good intentions to uphold and propagate the Three Treasures;
eighth, constantly generating great aspirations to cultivate and establish numinous contemplation;
ninth, constantly generating great aspirations to proclaim the scriptures and teachings;
tenth, constantly vowing to guide all and lead them to the true Dao;
eleventh, constantly vowing to expound the Great Vehicle and awaken the ignorant and benighted;
twelfth, constantly vowing to establish great blessings and benefits for emperors, kings, and lords of states;
thirteenth, constantly vowing to serve as fields of blessing for chief ministers and great officials;
fourteenth, constantly vowing to enable all beings to leave suffering;
fifteenth, constantly vowing for the longevity of kings and the peace of their lands;
sixteenth, constantly vowing for world peace and abundant harvests;
seventeenth, constantly vowing for the great propagation of the scriptures and teachings, enabling all to awaken and understand;
eighteenth, constantly vowing for all beings under heaven to turn toward the Great Dao;
nineteenth, constantly observing fasts and precepts without retrogression in thought;
twentieth, constantly revering the scriptures and Dharma, cultivating practice in every thought;
twenty-first, constantly facing the Heavenly Worthy, burning incense, and practicing the Dao;
twenty-second, widely copying the scriptures and teachings and disseminating them among people;
twenty-third, widely cultivating numinous contemplation, enabling all to turn toward it;
twenty-fourth, vowing for one’s Dharma-body to be firm and unretreatable;
twenty-fifth, greatly establishing fields of blessing to benefit all;
twenty-sixth, widely practicing alms-seeking to create various merits;
twenty-seventh, widely generating compassion to deliver all kinds of beings;
twenty-eighth, widely practicing compassion to bestow kindness on all;
twenty-ninth, constantly upholding the Dharma’s appearance without forsaking dignity;
thirtieth, universally aiding those in the three paths of hell with the supreme and wondrous Dharma, enabling them all to ascend and be delivered, forever free from dark suffering.

These thirty matters constitute the proper appearance of the renunciate’s practice. May they remain unretreatable in every thought across the three times—past, future, and present—abiding constantly in the Dharma-body, never resting or slackening, upholding and exalting the Great Dao, creating boundless blessings and benefits for all beings, so that all in the world, whether sentient or insentient, may attain the supreme Dao.

The regulations state: After leaving the household life, Daoist priests and nuns must first establish discipline to order and regulate the Dharma-teachings. There are five types to be selected:

First, those whose Dao-conduct is pure and deep, whose minds are constantly devoted to the Dharma, who do not seek private gain, and who vow to achieve accomplishment;
second, those who are incorruptible and upright, who do not offend against others, and whose aspiration is to establish fields of blessing;
third, those whose virtue and conduct are lofty and far-reaching, who are clear and skilled in the Dharma-teachings, to whom both Daoists and laity turn in refuge, and who are adept in expedient means;
fourth, those who discern the affairs of the times with subtlety, making them suitable for the world without violating the scriptural teachings;
fifth, those who are diligent and hardworking, capable of initiating and benefiting the Dharma-gate.

Selecting these five, establish them as the discipline to order and regulate the Dharma-teachings, serving as the model for propagation. If among them there is any conduct that harms the Dharma-gate, they must not be established. There are also those who falsely assume names and conduct, seeking personal gain with deceitful intentions—these are most unfit to be established. Furthermore, there are those who are truly pure and sincere but do not aspire to this—such persons should be carefully assessed for their suitability.

There are also ten types who must not be forcibly established:
First, those who do not believe in past lives, karmic retribution, or causal conditions;
second, those who know no shame and seek only personal benefit;
third, those who rely on power and nobility, whose intentions do not benefit the multitude;
fourth, those whose thoughts and intentions always harm the permanent endowment;
fifth, those who in every action harbor scheming minds;
sixth, those who do not understand the scriptures and precepts and further show no reverence;
seventh, those who do not recognize the affairs of the times and act stubbornly and willfully;
eighth, those who are pure outwardly but impure inwardly, foolish outwardly but cunning inwardly, genuine outwardly but false inwardly, upright outwardly but greedy inwardly, or who speak rightly but think wrongly;
ninth, those who neither harm nor benefit the multitude, yet falsely occupy a position in the Dharma;
tenth, those who, having attained a position in the Dharma, seek personal convenience, relying on this discipline to pursue private gain.

Those who exhibit these ten matters must not hold such office. If one does not follow these regulations in selection, appointing those who curry favor or share personal sentiments, their lifespan will be reduced by three thousand six hundred years.

The regulations further state: There are twenty-five matters of discipline that Dharma-disciples should constantly observe and uphold:
First, do not harbor deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the wealth of the Three Treasures;
second, do not harbor deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the communal property of the permanent endowment;
third, do not harbor deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the offerings of the four assemblies;
fourth, do not harbor contemptuous or neglectful intentions toward the great virtuous elders;
fifth, do not harbor contemptuous or neglectful intentions toward peers of middle age;
sixth, do not harbor contemptuous or neglectful intentions toward junior disciples and latecomers;
seventh, do not harbor contemptuous or neglectful intentions toward those of lowly status;
eighth, uphold the precepts in body and conduct, ensuring no violations;
ninth, skillfully harmonize and gladden, comforting and receiving superiors and inferiors;
tenth, skillfully employ expedient means to guide and lead Dharma-disciples;
eleventh, deeply discern the opportune moment in all beneficial matters;
twelfth, constantly abide in and uphold the Three Treasures in mind;
thirteenth, never damage the permanent abode;
fourteenth, relinquish and accept without discrimination, not generating aversion or attachment;
fifteenth, maintain no partiality toward any Dharma-assembly;
sixteenth, do not act arbitrarily in any matter;
seventeenth, maintain uprightness within, not offending against others;
eighteenth, in every matter, generate the aspiration to achieve accomplishment;
nineteenth, do not encroach upon even the slightest portion of any wealth;
twentieth, always desire to benefit and adorn the permanent endowment of the Three Treasures;
twenty-first, skillfully comprehend the opportune moment, harmonizing worldly affairs to prevent the Three Treasures from being damaged;
twenty-second, protect and nurture the Dharma-assembly, preventing external violations;
twenty-third, constantly teach the Dharma-assembly to follow the precepts and regulations;
twenty-fourth, gain the refuge of the noble and base, both within and without, so that their minds—before and after—remain steadfast and unwavering;
twenty-fifth, broadly employ sincere minds to accomplish the Dharma-gate, ensuring it is not damaged or destroyed, becoming an eternal field of blessing and a repository of goodness for future beings.

By these twenty-five matters, discipline the Dharma-gate, accomplish merit and virtue, so that in the past, present, and future, one may obtain boundless blessings.

The regulations further state: There are thirty matters that must not be done, by which the discipline of the Dharma-gate and the oversight of the permanent endowment are to be examined:
First, constantly harboring deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the wealth of the Three Treasures;
second, constantly harboring deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the communal property of the permanent endowment;
third, constantly harboring deceitful or oppressive intentions toward the offerings of the four assemblies;
fourth, constantly harboring contempt or neglect toward the great virtuous elders;
fifth, constantly harboring contempt or neglect toward peers of middle age;
sixth, constantly harboring contempt or neglect toward junior disciples and latecomers;
seventh, violating the precepts in body and conduct, committing transgressions in all actions;
eighth, being unable to harmonize and gladden superiors and inferiors;
ninth, being unable to guide Dharma-disciples;
tenth, being unable to employ expedient means in beneficial matters;
eleventh, not abiding in or upholding the Three Treasures in mind;
twelfth, constantly desiring to damage the permanent abode;
thirteenth, not tolerating criticism, generating aversion or attachment;
fourteenth, maintaining partiality toward the Dharma-assembly in mind;
fifteenth, acting arbitrarily in all matters;
sixteenth, being deceitful and false in conduct;
seventeenth, in every matter, generating aspirations that are never accomplished;
eighteenth, inevitably seizing even the slightest portion of any wealth;
nineteenth, never benefiting the permanent endowment of the Three Treasures, seeking only personal gain;
twentieth, not discerning the opportune moment, acting contrary to worldly affairs, causing external assemblies to encroach and damage the Three Treasures;
twenty-first, being unable to protect and nurture the Dharma-assembly, instead increasing unlawful conduct;
twenty-second, not teaching Dharma-disciples, leading many to violate the precepts and regulations;
twenty-third, breaking the refuge-mind of the noble and base, both within and without;
twenty-fourth, having no constancy in mind, before or after;
twenty-fifth, harboring biased and partial intentions, never achieving accomplishment, causing the Dharma-gate to be damaged and the field of blessing to be lost;
twenty-sixth, relying on powerful and noble patrons to manage and trade the Three Treasures;
twenty-seventh, exploiting the Dharma-gate to seek fame and profit, defiling the scriptural teachings;
twenty-eighth, selling the power of the Three Treasures, indulging in right and wrong;
twenty-ninth, upon hearing others’ criticisms, further engaging in unlawful conduct;
thirtieth, encroaching upon and damaging the permanent endowment of the Three Treasures, indulging the body and mind.

Should any of these thirty transgressions—even one—be committed, the offender shall in future lives be reborn among the beasts and birds, subject to slaughter or survival at human hands, forever barred from the human realm. In this present life, they shall suffer blindness, deafness, muteness, or dumbness; their hands shall be crippled, their feet lame, their forms incomplete. Daoist priests and female Daoist adepts must clearly recognize these precepts and prohibitions, abiding by them without violation.

The statutes declare: All Daoist priests and female Daoist adepts serving as overseers must uphold the Dharma in accordance with the law, diligently proclaiming the precepts and instructing their disciples. Should any violate the statutes, they shall be penalized with offerings of incense and oil, striking the bell, and performing prostrations. If they persist in transgression without repentance, they shall be assigned heavier labor. Should they be tasked with maintaining the oratory yet remain obstinate and disobedient, they shall be disciplined according to the statutes and expelled to their original masters. The aim is to guide the ignorant toward the Dao, ensuring they do not violate the precepts, all the while upholding rectitude and avoiding partiality, lest the statutes and canons fall into disorder. Those who disobey shall have their lifespan reduced by twenty-four hundred years.

*End of the Third Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Sandong Fengdao Kejie Yingshi

*Beginning of the Fourth Scroll of the* Dongxuan Lingbao Sandong Fengdao Kejie Yingshi

**Ritual for Reciting Scriptures**

Upon first entering the hall, perform the purification rite as prescribed. Offer incense thrice, circumambulate the scriptures once, then offer incense thrice again. Return to their positions, either with hands clasped or holding a tablet, bodies upright, and chant in unison: *"Each reverently pays homage."*

With utmost sincerity, bow to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Chant, then sit in proper posture. Once the purifying water is administered, one person shall carry incense and circumambulate. After the fumigation is complete, proceed with the scriptures. Again, hold incense to fumigate the scriptures, then chant the hymn of praise as prescribed. The incantation reads:

*"Karma’s truth is certain,*
*Yet the feeble call it nonexistent.*
*All desire to see before their eyes,*
*But what passes from sight, they deem distant.*
*The great sages illuminate the Dao’s teachings,*
*Grieving for the stubborn and unenlightened."*

With sorrow I lament your suffering, with diligence I bear my sorrow.

Next, chant and meditate in stillness as prescribed. Each shall lay down their tablet upon the desk, sit upright with hands clasped, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. With eyes closed, visualize five-colored clouds of qi filling the chamber, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Lion, Dark Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, and Phoenix guarding front and rear. Divine youths and jade maidens, the Five Thearchs’ spirit officials, immortals’ troops and cavalry—nine hundred million in number—encamp and defend on all sides. Then shake the body thrice and invoke:

*"Silent, it reaches the Primordial Source,*
*Void, it towers beyond kalpas’ blade.*
*Profound, the Huoluo’s Mystic Writ—*
*Who fathoms such depths of seclusion?*
*Once on the Great Vehicle’s path,*
*Who reckons the kalpas’ span?*
*Neither born nor dying,*
*Yet born through the lotus.*
*Transcending the Three Realms’ roads,*
*With compassion, the world’s snares unravel.*
*The Perfected, of supreme virtue,*
*Life after life, dwell as immortals."*

Next, chant the "All Recite" and invoke the Supreme Venerable One seven times. Then chant the request to turn the Wheel of Dharma, and all shall open the scriptures together. If another is designated to ascend the high seat and recite, chant the invitation for the Dharma Master to ascend. The Dharma Master rises, holds the tablet, and bows thrice before the scripture and image. Facing south, west, and north toward the high seat, then turning left to face east, they strike the teeth and meditate as prescribed. Descending the seat, they bow thrice from the south. Such is the *Dongxuan* Dharma. For *Dongzhen* and *Dongshen*, follow their respective rites. Those who practice scripture rituals shall adhere to their own regulations; these are not repeated here.

When the scripture reading concludes, one person collects the scriptures, sprinkles purifying water, and circumambulates with incense. Once purification is complete, chant the hymn of praise as prescribed. All chant with reverence, offer incense thrice, hold their tablets upright, and with utmost sincerity, surrender themselves to the Supreme Three Honored Ones and the saints of the ten directions. A senior adept shall extol the scriptures and make vows, declaring:

*"The Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, the myriad heavens’ sublime models, condense the qi of soaring mystery and form the chapters of cloud-seal script. Their meaning crowns primordial arising, their text endures through eternal kalpas. Thus, heaven and earth rely on them for division and judgment; sun and moon depend on them for movement and revolution. Ghosts and spirits revere them for transformation and penetration; the people uphold them for liberation and deliverance. Those who chant them ascend to the crimson empyrean; those who hear them are reborn in the azure vault. None—whether human or celestial—do not look up to them in reliance, nor—whether living or dead—do not depend on them for refuge. They are the bridge for all beings, the gateway for the host of perfected immortals. What cannot be spoken of in words is the treasury of the Great Vehicle.*

*Today, for such-and-such a purpose, we turn such-and-such a scripture, so many scrolls, so many times. As the case is opened and its mysteries expounded, the resonance reaches the Three Thousand Worlds; as the scroll is held and its profundities intoned, the sound is heard by five hundred million. May the golden maidens attending incense inscribe fragrant characters in the heavens; may the jade lads overseeing scriptures present the sacred text upon the tablets. Thus, past transgressions from former kalpas shall dissolve, and blessings descend upon this very day. The living and the dead shall rejoice in the grace of peace and prosperity; all beings, moving and still, shall delight in the virtue of growth and fulfillment. Through this supreme goodness, may all adornments be perfected. May the Three Paths cease their torments, and the Nine Nights end their bitterness and sorrow. May all beings, from the most refined to the most humble, together board the boat of the Six Perfections and ascend the shore of the Three Clarities.*

*After the turning of the scriptures, may ten thousand virtues uphold us, and a thousand disasters be dispelled. With utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures. After the turning of the scriptures, may blessings extend to the hidden and the manifest, and merit reach the distant and the near. With utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures. May the merit of this turning of the scriptures extend to all beings, freeing them from suffering and granting liberation. With utmost sincerity, we bow to all the saints."*

For regular scripture practice, circumambulate while reciting the *Taiyi Scripture Hymns* (seven verses), the *Four Heavenly Kings’ Eulogies from the Numinous Writ* (four verses), the *Eight Radiant Eulogies of the True Writ*, and the *Hymns of the Supreme Scripture*; these are not repeated here.

The regulations state: For all scripture recitation, follow this rite. Violations deduct 2,400 days from one’s lifespan.

**Lecture Rite for Scriptures**
The Dharma Master washes and rinses, dons robes and sash as prescribed. Disciples hold incense and flowers, bow, and request guidance, all according to the regulations. The Dharma Master ascends to the seat before the scripture and image, stands upright holding the incense burner before the heart, then chants for all to show reverence and take refuge in the Great Dao.

*"May all beings awaken to the True and Real, arouse the supreme mind, and take refuge in the scriptures and Dharma.*
*May all beings’ wisdom open wide, vast as the sea, and take refuge in the Mystic Master.*
*May all beings discern the obscure and resolve obstructions, all propagating the True Dao."*

The Dharma Master ascends the platform and stands upright. Chant for all to sit properly as prescribed. After the Dharma Master offers incense thrice, chant again for still meditation as prescribed. Once visualization is complete, chant the hymn of praise as prescribed. The incantation reads:

*"Silent, it reaches the Primordial Source,*
*Void, it towers beyond kalpas’ blade.*
*Profound, the Huoluo’s Mystic Writ—*
*Who fathoms such depths of seclusion?*
*Once on the Great Vehicle’s path,*
*Who reckons the kalpas’ span?*
*Neither born nor dying,*
*Yet born through the lotus.*
*Transcending the Three Realms’ roads,*
*With compassion, the world’s snares unravel.*
*The Perfected, of supreme virtue,*
*Life after life, dwell as immortals."*

Next, chant the request to turn the Wheel of Dharma, then chant the "All Recite" and universally invoke the Supreme Venerable One seven times. The chief cantor then introduces the scripture and chants its title, while the Dharma Master instructs the assembly and bows once to the scripture. After explaining the text, the lecture concludes with harmonious music and the refrain *"Le Wei Yang."*

After each lecture, the Dharma Master holds the incense burner and offers incense, vowing:

*"May the merit of this lecture adorn the Emperor, the Crown Prince, the princes, dukes, governors, and local officials; the people of the realm; the faithful who attend the lecture; the present assembly of disciples; all beings; and those suffering in the Three Paths. Through this root of goodness, may all awaken to the Great Vehicle, turn their hearts to the True Dao, escape the river of desire, and together sail the sea of Dharma."*

Again, chant for all to show reverence and with utmost sincerity surrender themselves to the Supreme Three Honored Ones and the saints of the ten directions.

*"May the Emperor be adorned with a hundred blessings, may ten thousand virtues gather like clouds. With utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures."*

Through the merit of this sutra lecture, may all beings be blessed, freed from suffering, and attain liberation. With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the assembly of perfected saints and the disciples who uphold the Dharma. With incense and flowers, we escort the Dharma Master back to his place, bowing in accordance with ritual propriety.

**Regulation states:** All sutra lectures shall follow this procedure. Violations shall incur a deduction of 1,200 days from one’s allotted lifespan.

**Dharma Ritual Protocol**

**Regulation states:** Daoist priests and priestesses hold ranks, titles, and hierarchical positions. One must recognize distinctions of seniority and precedence; no overstepping is permitted. Below is the full enumeration—study it carefully. Violations shall incur a deduction of 1,200 days from one’s allotted lifespan.

**Regulation states:** Terms such as *Daoist layfolk*, *worthy ones*, *devotees*, *good men*, *good women*, and *practitioners* are honorifics for those who precede Daoist priests and priestesses in virtue; they are not legal designations for petitions or complaints. Likewise, titles such as *Dharma Master*, *Great Virtue*, *Venerable Master*, and *Superior One* are honorifics for male renunciates of external lineages and are not suitable for memorials or formal requests. Furthermore, *this humble Daoist* is a self-deprecating term for renunciates, while *disciple* is a humble term for the laity—neither is to be used before the Three Treasures. These differ from the titles *Disciple of the Three Caverns* and *Dharma Master*; study them carefully. Below is the full enumeration:

- *Men* and *women* refer to ordinary people who have not yet received scriptures or precepts.
- *Household head* refers to those registered in the Daoist household records who offer sincerity to the Dao.
- *Disciples of the Great Dao*, *Disciples of the Heavenly Worthy*, *Disciples of the Three Treasures*, *those who turn their hearts to the Great Dao*, and *those who diligently study the scriptural teachings* may bear these titles.
- *Pure and Faithful Disciples* who receive the Heavenly Worthy’s Ten Precepts, Fourteen Rules of Conduct, or the Twelve Precepts of Compliance, Six Emotions, and the like may bear this title.
- *Male Initiates* and *Female Initiates*, at ages seven or eight, who receive the Register of One General may bear this title.
- *Register Initiates*, at age ten or above, who receive the Registers of Three Generals or Ten Generals, as well as the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, may bear this title.

**Regulation states:** For all ten titles, when making petitions or memorials before the Heavenly Worthy and the Great Dao, one must refer to oneself as *so-and-so* (某甲) and not use the title directly. Violations shall incur a deduction of 360 days from one’s allotted lifespan.

Upon transmission of the above, the recipient is titled *Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Cavern of Mysterious Capital* and *Supreme Master of the Three Caverns*.

**Ordinance states:** Daoists and female Daoist adepts, when receiving scriptures, precepts, and registers, must adhere to this sequential hierarchy of titles and ranks; no presumption or error is permitted. On the day of transmission, the master shall carefully and clearly instruct the recipient in the grades and categories. Violation results in the deduction of 3,600 years from one’s allotted lifespan.

**Ordinance states:** Daoists and female Daoist adepts, after receiving scriptures and precepts, must recite their precept texts to achieve thorough familiarity. On the first, fifteenth, and thirtieth days of each month, all shall assemble in the Dharma hall to mutually examine and review. Three failures to recite result in a penalty of five *jin* of incense; violation incurs the deduction of 1,200 years from one’s allotted lifespan.

**Ordinance states:** Daoists and female Daoist adepts shall copy all received scriptures, precepts, and registers according to their catalogues, bind them, and store them in the scripture hall, quiet chamber, or pavilion. They shall properly arrange dragon jades, banners, flowers, and true writs, and make daily offerings with reverence and repentance. No carelessness, defilement, or transmission to others is permitted; constant recitation and reading are required. After one’s passing, disciples and fellow students shall continue the offerings and recitation, without negligence or disrespect. As for the *Orthodox Unity* talismans and all certificates in their cases, these shall be buried in a pit at the mountain valley or tomb where the deceased master resided; none may be taken away. This is because the true scriptures are of precious and numinous weight, attended by divine officials. How could the defilement of a rotting corpse be allowed near them? This matter demands the utmost caution. Violation results in the soul’s condemnation by the Three Bureaus, with calamity extending to seven generations of descendants. All must clearly heed this.

**Ordinance states:** Daoists and female Daoist adepts who cumulatively receive all preceding methods and fully cultivate their practice shall, when submitting petitions, declare: *"Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Cavern of Mysterious Capital, practicing the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Ascent to the Mysterious, Master of the [specific] Prison, [specific] Thearch Perfected, and Three August Ones’ Cavern of Spirits and Cavern of Abysses’ Divine Incantations, Great Ancient Negation and Twofold Obscurity’s Minor Omen Perfected, your subject [Name] respectfully submits"*—or bow twice. If fully versed in the *Orthodox Unity* method, declare: *"Supreme Mysterious Capital’s Orthodox Unity and Balanced Qi, affiliated with the Celestial Master’s Yangping Abbey and Supreme Middle Qi, overseeing the twenty-four vital qi, supervising the twenty-four abbeys and three-five great metropolises’ merits, Orthodox Unity Alliance’s Primordial Mandate Perfected, your subject [Name] bows twice and respectfully addresses."*

If one presumptuously usurps this rank, the Three Offices shall examine the soul, and all life’s allotted spans shall be forfeit—beware, beware.

**Regulations on Ritual Attire and Demeanor**
The *Statutes* state: Attire mirrors virtue and embodies form.
Daoists and female Daoist adepts must first perfect their demeanor, wearing and bearing the scriptures and methods in full accordance with their respective traditions—no presumption or error is permitted.

The *Statutes* state: All Daoists and female Daoist adepts intending to engage with scriptures and methods must prepare their ritual vestments in advance.
Upon completing the announcement of the fast and transmission of the dharma rank, they must don the proper cap and vestments, hold the ritual tablet, declare their name and rank, bow to their master, and pay homage to the Most High.
Violation: Divine officials do not attend the body, the Five Thearchs examine the soul, and 1,200 spans of life are forfeit.

The *Statutes* state: Female Daoist adepts’ vestments—robes and skirts—are identical to those of Daoists, except for the cap, which differs in design.

**Scripture of the Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure, and Three Caverns’ Observances of Daoist Precepts and Rites, Scroll Six**

**Rite of Daily Audience**
The Four Assemblies of the Three Caverns may perform this daily, morning and evening—hence it is called the *Daily Audience*.
For separate chamber audiences with the Perfected, follow the five grades of audience rites.

**Purification Ritual**
Upon entering the hall, offer incense and circumambulate while reciting:
*"To study the Dao, one must toil diligently,
Gathering faith to refine sincerity.
Burning incense, we return to the Most High,
True qi mingles with fragrant smoke.
May great pardon be granted,
That the seven ancestors depart the dark realms."*

Offer incense three times, then take positions, compose the body, hold the ritual tablet, and pay homage to the ten directions, beginning with the east.
After offering incense, the assembly sings in unison: *"Each reverently respectful."*

With utmost sincerity, prostrate and invoke:
*"To the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the East, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity.
To the Mysterious Perfected Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the South, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity.
To the Supreme Wondrous Utmost Heavenly Worthy of the West, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity.
To the Mysterious Supreme Jade Dawn Heavenly Worthy of the North, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity.

To the Jade Clarity August Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity.
To the Perfected August Heavenly Worthy of the Cavern Spirits of the Lower Realm, we prostrate and invoke with utmost sincerity."*

Each kneels lengthily, holding the tablet to the heart, and confesses:
*"We prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Boundless Great Dao Heavenly Worthy, confessing on behalf of the imperial house, all officials, and all beings. In past lives and the present, our bodies may have transgressed—our limbs’ movements and postures may have violated precepts or deviated from scriptures. The sins of bodily karma are measureless and boundless. Through this rite of repentance, we beseech their eradication. May all beings enter the realm of supreme immortals, unite with the Dao, and merge with the Perfected. We bow to the Ten Directions’ Orthodox Three Treasures."*

We prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Boundless Great Dao Heavenly Worthy, confessing on behalf of the imperial house, all officials, and all beings. In past lives and the present, our minds may have transgressed—our thoughts and intentions may have lacked focus, emotions drifted, and desires wandered without cease. The sins of mental karma are measureless and boundless. Through this rite of repentance, we beseech their eradication. May all beings unite their spirits with true quiescence, penetrate the natural, and bow to the Ten Directions’ Orthodox Three Treasures.

We prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Boundless Great Dao Heavenly Worthy, confessing on behalf of the imperial house, all officials, and all beings. Our speech may have transgressed—good and evil reversed in discourse, deceitful words embellished falsehoods, and flowery rhetoric deluded the masses. The sins of verbal karma are measureless and boundless. Through this rite of repentance, we beseech their eradication. May all beings unite their nature and life with the Dao, profoundly merge with non-action, and bow to the Ten Directions’ Orthodox Three Treasures.

Each stands upright and chants, then bows facing north. Standing, they recite the scripture, intoning:

*"Delight in the Dharma as one’s wife,
Cherish the scriptures as pearls and jade.
Uphold the precepts to restrain the six senses,
Contemplate the Dao to dispel desires.
Serene and pure, the upright qi abides,
Tranquil and still, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes receive boundless fortune.
Flourishing are the state and family,
Prosperous the scriptures and Dao.
Heaven and humanity share this vow,
Ethereally entering the Great Vehicle.
Cultivating the mind to establish merit,
The Dharma wheel ascends without cease.
Seven ancestors ascend to heavenly halls,
My body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void,
Every thought finds perfect accord.
Refining the body to join the immortals,
Attaining the adamantine form.
Transcending the three realms’ trials,
The five sufferings of hell dissolve.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures,
In silent contemplation, we bow in reverence."*

With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures,
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

First vow: May the Two Principles endure eternally, their covering and bearing boundless. With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Orthodox Three Treasures.

Twelfth vow: May all beings in the three wretched realms and five sufferings escape the bonds of desire and together ascend the shore of fortune. With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Orthodox Three Treasures.

*Hymn on Cultivating Immortality*
*"Cultivating immortality is urgent,
Uphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.
Dwell in emptiness and upright qi,
Immortals and sages naturally seek you.
If you do not trust the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountains and forests?"*

*Regulations state:* For all court audiences, follow this ritual. Violations deduct 1,200 years from one’s lifespan.

*Midday Purification Rite*
At the appointed hour, bathe and cleanse, make offerings according to the proper method, and chant for all to reverently attend.

With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures,
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

Circumambulate while offering incense, all officials recite the Most Supreme Revered One, and offer incense.

*Intoning:*
*"The Dao takes purification as foremost,
Diligent practice ascends the golden portals.
Thus is the great Dharma bridge established,
Universally delivering all beings.
Repaying the kindness of past lives,
The Dao-heart arises transcendent.
The body soars to the Mysterious Capital,
Seven ancestors all attain liberation."*

With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Supreme Three Worthies and the Ten Directions’ multitude of sages.

The officiating official kneels and extols the Dao’s merits and virtues.

*"Consider the self without form,
Yet manifesting wondrous forms in the human realm;
The body without substance,
Yet revealing the true body beyond appearances.
Thus able to divide into a hundred thousand forms,
Transformations without end,
Shadows scattered in countless millions,
Unpredictable in their comings and goings.
Thereby, compassion pervades the Dharma realm,
Age after age delivering beings;
Virtue blankets the dust-like worlds,
Everywhere teaching and transforming.
Sometimes traveling through eighty-one lands,
Spreading transformation among the western barbarians;
Sometimes dwelling in the world for over nine hundred years,
Guiding this central land.
Universally enabling humans and devas to awaken,
Both attaining the gate of liberation,
Life and death returning to truth,
All escaping the waves of rebirth.
Thereafter, the spirit congeals in the golden portals,
Alone becoming the ancestor of myriad sages;
The body wondrous in the jade capital,
Loftily treading above the Nine Purities.
Thus, in heaven above and below,
The three realms and ten directions,
Majestic and most revered,
Is only our Great Dao.
Today, the officiating official so-and-so,
For such-and-such a matter, arranges wondrous offerings,
To present this humble sincerity,
Bowing to the Ten Directions, reverently to the Three Treasures.
May the divine power be free and unhindered,
Stooping to consider all beings;
May the wondrous responses be boundless,
Looking up to bestow compassionate blessings.
Even as flying immortals descend,
Revealing the laws of sin and fortune;
May the assembly of wondrous practices arrive,
Examining the standards of karmic conditions.
Dust-like faults and burdens,
All beseech to be eradicated;
Vast kalpas of transgressions,
All beseech to be cleansed.
Present good roots grow,
Together flourishing like the kalpa tree;
Past evil karma vanishes,
Equal to the fragrant groves’ bliss.
Relying on this supreme merit,
Universally extending without limit,
The nine dark realms’ sorrowful souls,
The six destinies’ rebirth consciousness,
All beings and every kind,
All sentient life,
Together transcend the river of love and desire,
All reach the shore of carefree ease."*

May the patrons’ seven generations of parents ascend to the Pure Land, their sublime rewards boundless—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
May the patrons’ households know peace, their doors harmonious—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
May the patrons’ descendants flourish, each generation wise and bright—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
May the patrons’ karmic burdens be washed away, their blessings and wisdom perfected—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
May the world know great peace, all families joyful—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
May all beings escape every suffering, together enter the True—with utmost sincerity, we bow to the assembly of enlightened sages.

Seated in proper form, the offering of food is blessed with this prayer:
*"This incantation for receiving food—
All fields of merit find,
In offering food, the foremost deed.
In this life, joy is known;
In past lives, rebirth in heaven gained.
In future times, dwelling in the Pure Land,
Clothing and sustenance ever natural.
Thus we now make offering,
Universally presenting to all deities."*

When the food is distributed, all join hands and recite:
*"Exquisite offerings from the fragrant kitchen,
Presented above to the Heavenly Worthies,
In the middle to the Perfected Sages,
Below to all beings—
Universally sated and fulfilled,
Blessings flow to the patrons,
As waters return to the sea."*

After the meal, the offering of repentance is made:
*"We humbly invoke the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions.
Before this assembly, we declare:
The vegetarian feast prepared today by the disciples
May have been touched by impure hands,
Worn impure garments,
Used impure vessels,
Contained impure grains—
In every matter, many imperfections may have arisen.
May the Three Treasures, in vast compassion,
Bestow joy upon the offering.
Any remaining provisions,
We dedicate universally.
May the givers receive blessings,
And those who partake be free from transgression."*

The patrons then take incense, making offerings according to ritual, chanting and praising as prescribed.
For all future lives, they plant the seeds of good karma.
If enlightenment is granted, they reverently receive the sagely grace.

Next, the patrons present pure offerings, reciting the prayer of dedication:
*"We humbly invoke the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions and all Perfected Sages.
The patrons [Name], having completed this feast for [purpose],
Fearing the merit may yet be incomplete,
Now offer pure wealth, dedicating it to the Three Treasures.
May this act of giving,
Afterward bring the seven ancestors to heaven,
Those living know joy,
And through all future lives,
Receive boundless blessings."*

Then the chanting begins, each person reverently joining:
*"With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Supreme Three Worthies and the assembly of sages of the Ten Directions.
May the patrons be adorned with a hundred blessings,
A myriad virtues gathered—
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the True Three Treasures.
Through this feast’s merit,
May all beings be encompassed,
Freed from suffering, liberated—
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the assembly of enlightened sages."*

**Ritual Instructions:**
For a medium-scale feast, follow this rite.
Those who violate it forfeit 1,600 days of lifespan.

**Medium Assembly Rite**
Entering the Dao’s gate, recite the purification incantation, take incense, and knock the teeth—all as in the *Rite of Walking the Dao*.

The incense-burning incantation:
*"Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Original Qi,
Most High Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
Jade Lads of Incense,
Jade Maidens of Transmission,
Direct Messengers of the Five Thearchs—
Each thirty-six in number.
Open the passes and invoke the local earth deities and true officials of this realm.
Now we burn incense,
May the wondrous qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones
Descend and infuse this servant’s body,
So that what is declared swiftly reaches
The presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao."*

**Declaring Name and Rank:**
*"Most High Numinous Treasure Cavern-Mystery Dharma Master [Name], Perfected One of [Sacred Peak],
Humbly invokes:
The Utmost Boundless Great Dao,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Supreme Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,
Officials of the Two Realms,
All majestic spirits.
Now we burn incense,
May this merit flow to [Family Name],
Their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of parents,
Those living and present,
Begging forgiveness and absolution.
For all transgressions—
Past lives and present,
Every offense, rebellion, and foul deed,
Countless sins and myriad faults—
All beseech to be eradicated.
May the deceased ascend to heaven,
Clothed and fed by nature,
Those living see disasters vanish and misfortunes cease,
Ever dwelling in blessings, fortune, and good karma.
May their households be noble and pure,
Descendants flourish,
Generation after generation enjoy prosperity,
All wishes fulfilled.
Now we burn incense,
May resonance swiftly reach
The presence of the Boundless Dao."*

*"With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Eastern Utmost Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy."*
[Repeat for all ten directions: South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Above, Below.]

Recite the Three Pacts and Hymns.

*"With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Utmost Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Supreme Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm."*

**Re-declaring Name and Rank:**
*"Most High Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure Dharma Master [Name], Perfected One of [Sacred Peak],
Humbly invokes:

The Thirty-Six Divisions of Supreme Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,
High Ministers and High Chancellors,
Officials of the Four Offices and Five Thearchs,
Officials of the Three Realms,
All true spirits.
Now we take incense,
Wishing to repent and atone for
Countless kalpas of transgressions up to this day,
The heavy sins of past lives and deaths—
Whether offending heaven or violating earth,
Disrespecting the Three Treasures,
Killing and harming beings,
Cursing and reviling,
Envy, malice, greed,
Lust, dissipation,
Ignorance, theft,
Duplicity in speech and thought,
The three karmas and six senses—
Innumerable transgressions.
Now we confess and beseech their eradication.
May the deceased ascend to heaven,
Those living know peace,
Descendants flourish,
Blessings arise naturally.
May all on earth and in heaven,
The five sufferings and three paths,
Escape dark prisons,
Together receive grace and nourishment.
May all sentient beings
Enter the Dao’s precincts."*

Respectfully declared.
A second offering of incense, the incantation for sealing the burner:
*"Incense Official Envoys,
Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
Attendant Spirit Officials—
May this place of assembly
Naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure essence,
Mushroom spirits, a hundred numina,
All Perfected Ones gathered,
Assembled before the incense altar."*

Celestial youths and jade maidens of the ten directions,
Attend the incense smoke,
Transmit and memorialize all that has been declared,
Directly to the presence of the Boundless Dao.

Proceed in procession, then recite the hymn:

The Dao holds purification as foremost,
Diligent practice ascends the Golden Gates.
Thus is the great Dharma Bridge established,
Universally ferrying all beings and things.
Repaying karmic kindness from past lives,
The Dao-mind arises transcendent.
The body soars to the Mystic Capital,
Seven generations all attain liberation.

**Protocol states:**
For all central assemblies, follow this rite.
Violation incurs a penalty of one thousand six hundred years from one’s lifespan.

**Rite for Ferrying Beings**
Before the purification hour arrives, those to be ferried stand at the base of the steps, facing west to take leave of parents and give thanks to the nine ancestral generations, performing twelve prostrations in total.
Next, face north to bow to the Son of Heaven, four prostrations.
This is because, having donned the vestments of the Heavenly Worthy, one no longer bows to parents or the sovereign. Yet at this moment of entering the Dao, leave-taking is required.
Once completed, clasp hands and stand upright, facing north to take the Three Refuges and perform three bows to the Three Treasures.
With utmost sincerity, take refuge in the body of the Most High Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, take refuge in the spirit of the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, take refuge in the life of the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.
Turn to face west and bow to the Three Masters—Overseer, Ferryman, and Ordainer—each with three prostrations. Then kneel.
First, the Preceptor fastens the Dharma skirt;
Next, the Overseer fastens the cloud sleeves;
Then, the Ordainer fastens the Dharma mantle.
After the Dharma crown is placed upon the head, withdraw and bow three times to the Three Masters.
Stand upright, holding the tablet, facing north.
The Master stands facing east, reciting the Three Hymns of Wisdom:

*Wisdom arises from the originless,
Luminous, transcending the ten directions.
Weaving emptiness, it towers in the Mystic Empyrean,
All heavens draw from its fragrant flow.
Its subtlety defies thought,
Vacuity and resonance truly commune.
Being is ultimately non-being,
Non-being holds all without exclusion.*

*Wisdom ever observes the body,
The foremost study of the Dao.
Subtly entering the Mystic Ford,
Naturally my spirit is recorded.
The Heavenly Worthy ever guards,
The Demon King vows protection.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
Lofty the Most High Clarity.*

*Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,
The true Dao holds precepts as master.
From this the Three Treasures arise,
Revered and received by exalted sages.
Riding this deathless vessel,
Swiftly it ferries the great multitude.
At this moment of precept-recitation,
All heavens together bow their heads.*

At the beginning and end of each hymn, all chant *"Excellent!"* and bow once. After all are completed, turn to bow to the ten directions, beginning with the north:
With utmost sincerity, take refuge in the life of the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless North.
(Repeat for all ten directions: east, south, west, southeast, northeast, southwest, northwest, above, and below.)
Then withdraw, standing in the east facing west.
The Master stands in the west facing east, expounding the Ten Precepts.
The newly ferried all recite their names to receive them.

The Heavenly Worthy declares:
*"Good men and good women, you who have aroused the natural Dao-mind and come to enter the Dharma—receive my Ten Precepts, and you shall become pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao. Together with the valiant flying immortals, you shall share equal merit. Thus unwavering, you may transcend the Three Realms and become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity. Submit and receive them, heed them deeply in your hearts."*

*First: Do not kill. Contemplate all living beings.*

Second: Do not engage in licentiousness or entertain wayward and deviant thoughts.
Third: Do not steal or take wealth that is not rightfully yours.
Fourth: Do not deceive; reverse false judgments of good and evil.
Fifth: Do not become intoxicated; constantly reflect on pure conduct.
Sixth: Maintain harmony among clan and kin, without fostering enmity.
Seventh: Upon seeing others do good deeds, rejoice and lend your heart’s support.
Eighth: Upon seeing others in distress, assist them in performing meritorious acts.
Ninth: When others inflict harm upon you, resolve not to seek repayment.
Tenth: Before achieving the Dao yourself, do not harbor expectations of others.

The Heavenly Worthy declares:
*"Those who cultivate and uphold these pure precepts align ever with the heart of Heaven. Ever practicing great compassion, they aspire to act for the sake of all. Reverently following the exalted teachings without negligence, they would rather die in adherence to goodness than live by doing evil. Unwavering in this, they may transcend the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evil Realms. By maintaining a perpetual fast and upholding the precepts, they shall naturally attain deliverance across the world."*

The newly ferried bow three times to the Master, then turn north and bow three times to the Three Worthies.

They recite the Precept Hymn, which says:
*The Dao is the宗 of non-action,
All things become fields of merit.
Establishing merit has no fixed master,
Each person’s original vow is their own.
Emptying the self to respond to all beings,
Direct the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the utmost teaching,
As rain descends from Heaven.
Lofty heights reach all without exception,
Yet the humble become profound.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
Thus it gathers the scales of dragons.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved,
Not merely for the span of years.
Upholding the precepts without the slightest lapse,
Lifetimes of good karmic bonds are formed.
With focused thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao."*

The statute states: *"All who ferry others across must follow this ritual."*

Those who violate this shall have their allotted years reduced by one thousand two hundred.

The statute states: *"These Eight Rituals are the essentials for Daoist priests and nuns in their practice. Compiled for timely reference, they must be observed accordingly."*

Those who violate this shall be examined by the Four Offices, their souls no longer counted among the statutes of the Supreme Dao, and their allotted years reduced by two thousand four hundred.
