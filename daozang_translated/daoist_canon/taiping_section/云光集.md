**By Wang Chuyi of Yuyang of the Sacred Waters – Poetry [Seven-Character Regulated Verse]**

In the *ding-si* year of the Cheng’an era, I received the third imperial summons and arrived at Tianchang Abbey in the capital on the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month. On the third day of the seventh month, I was granted an audience and offered a seat. The Emperor inquired about the *Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*, and I expounded upon it. He then asked about the northern campaign, to which I replied: "It shall cease in the *wu-wu* year." This later proved true. Next, he questioned me on the Quanzhen lineage, and I answered each query in turn. The Emperor expressed deep admiration and detained me until dusk before I was permitted to leave. The following day, I was bestowed a purple robe and the title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. A close attendant was dispatched to convey the imperial decree, granting me Chongfu and Xiuzhen Abbeys to reside in as I pleased, along with a monthly allowance of two hundred strings of cash for vegetarian meals. While staying at Xiuzhen Abbey, I composed this poem to send to my aged mother and the Daoist community of Sacred Waters.

Beneath Xiuzhen Abbey, messages flow unimpeded,
As auspicious light shuttles through the azure sky.
Once I met a radiant master who revealed the true teaching;
Now I receive the sagely Emperor’s aid in spreading the mystic wind.
From this day, Yuyang shall guide transformation,
And the Dharma assembly shall henceforth cultivate with diligence.
I bow to my compassionate mother—cast aside all worry,
For the imperial grace has not yet permitted my return home.

**For the Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner, Seeking Healing from Illness**

Heaven-born, Heaven-long, in accord with Heaven’s cultivation,
No matter the dusty world or the bones of the vulgar.
How could the four impermanent states approach the Phoenix Terrace?
How could the three corpses reach the isles of Yingzhou?
Awakening to truth, the inner light forgets new afflictions;
Grasping the root, the heart turns to ash, dispelling old sorrows.
The colorless true emptiness transcends the other shore,
Steadily riding the boundless great divine vessel.

**Presented to Lü, Abbot of Zu’an Abbey**

Great awakening’s majestic light illumines the vast sky,
The true auspice of prior Heaven arrives in haste.
The void and pure, serene and still, endure through past and present;
The supreme Dao flows forth, rightly transmitted by the ancestral masters.
The three realms and ten directions are all of one accord,
The thousand scriptures and myriad discourses—inexhaustible in their profundity.
Forgetting emotion, the Lord of Heavenly Origin manifests,
Emerging from within the transformations of yin and yang.

**Presented to the Abbess of Weizhou Abbey**

Who has encountered a living immortal?
Truly nurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure heavens.
From the jade treasury, true water and fire are drawn and replenished;
In the jasper palace, auspicious clouds and mist congeal.
Form and spirit both wondrous—who can comprehend?
Emptiness and form wholly dissolved—how can the principle be conveyed?
The four seas turn their light inward, all revering the teaching;
Naturally, merit and virtue fill the three thousand realms.

**Two Poems Presented to the Daoist Community for Their Support**

Deep gratitude to our lineage for its vast support,
Steadfast and unwavering in diligent refinement.
Preserving the spirit in silence, dust remains unstained;
Cultivating qi in continuity, the Dao is natural.
Revealing the original source, the pure and tranquil Lord;
Transforming and generating the mystic image, the embryonic immortal dances.
The revolving jade pivot governs the true Three Treasures,
Immovable, the light of compassion fills the great thousandfold world.

Upholding the Dao in poverty, the Dao is nameless,
All depends on the human heart’s sincere resolve.
One qi circulates, purifying the cosmos;
The three luminaries converge, gathering the numinous.
Auspicious omens at the jade altar conceal the immortal’s traces;
Propitious radiance from the precious tripod veils transformation and birth.
Uttering the true oral formula of the inner elixir,
Wondrous workings dance and abide, spontaneously perfected.

**[Ode to Yuqing Abbey]**

The master’s former retreat—Zhuyan’s northern Yuqing Abbey,
Called "Little Sacred Waters," truly a place of excellence.
Thus, this poem.

This cliff’s sacred site is rare through past and present;
Leisurely pacing through mist and rosy clouds, the daylight lingers.
The sages of the three realms cast their regard;
The Dao and virtue of this land are wholly refined.
Pair upon pair of youths bear flowered staves;
Couple after couple of auspicious simurghs dance upon the jade steps.
Soon, the great elixir shall be completed and I shall return;
With those of karmic affinity, I shall accompany them to the Jasper Pool.

**For Clerk Wang of Fushan, Seeking Instruction Due to Illness**

Gently, subtly nurturing harmony,
Silently cultivating the heart, emerging from the river of desire.
Augmenting the Valley Spirit, ever unceasing;
Transmitting the blood and pulse, forever free from ailment.
Realizing the true and emitting the Dao, forgetting birth and death;
Perceiving nature and penetrating the numinous, severing demonic obstructions.
Age after age, it is due to upright merit and virtue;
The myriad spirits all bear one aloft from the world of suffering.

**For Attendant Wu, Staying Through Summer**

Well met, sharing this place to seek coolness,
Gathering the numinous cinnabar, its fragrance beyond the heavens.
The four great elements return, the qi pure and temperate;
The twin springs irrigate, the jade countenance radiant.
Regulating the spirit, immovable—misfortune becomes blessing;
Encountering things without partiality—yin reverts to yang.
Another livelihood, idly passing the days,
Unfurling the precious scriptures, perusing two or three lines.

**Two Poems on Escaping the World’s Net**

Accord with Heaven’s merit and virtue, transforming and arising,
The Dharma-body’s luminosity pervades the nine realms.
The wisdom-eye, limpid and clear, without the slightest attachment;
The spirit-pearl, bright and resplendent, utterly free from dust.
The five directions’ numinous radiance soars heavenward;
A single blossom of the heart brushes the sun, unfolding.
The true visage through the vast kalpa appears anew;
Only then does one know that everywhere is Penglai.

Freed from the world’s net, no entanglements remain;
The elixir already perfected, the Dao is natural.
From the Purple Palace, jade snow flutters;
From the Jasper Terrace, golden lotuses gradually bloom.
The palaces of the spirit, segment by segment, perfectly coalesce;
The Dharma-nature, empty and vast, shines in full illumination.
Within and without, the golden-jade body is refined;
All because of a single encounter with a Great Luo Immortal.

**Two Poems on Rustic Aspirations**

For decades, muddled wine and wild song,
A body unburdened, roaming in dreams as an immortal.
Preserving the heart to save and deliver across the three realms;
The entire being luminous, piercing the nine heavens.
A life beyond the world—only I understand;
The treasures within the gourd—who pities them?
The Jade Yang Master of the eastern cloud-sea,
Delivers the foolish and deluded, never transmitting in vain.

I shall open and transform, blending the three yangs,
Layer upon layer of mist and rosy clouds filling the ten directions.
Refining the precious pearl, containing the Dharma-realm;
Transforming and generating numinous radiance, reaching the vault of heaven.
Tiger and dragon coil around the golden tripod;
Sun and moon soar, illuminating the jade hall.
By the time I ride the simurgh back to the Purple Palace,
In the realm of Great Peace, I shall harmonize with the light.

**Two Poems in Response to Disciple Zhang Zhiming’s Inquiry on Daily Practice**

Hark! Seeking the true amidst the false, like carving and polishing,
Embodying Heaven and modeling the Dao, nurturing harmony.
Within the shadows of the three luminaries, the heart-seal is grasped;
Amidst the gates of the myriad Dharmas, the honey of awakening is savored.
Two paths of pure wind penetrate the Purple Palace;
The six heavens’ will emerges from the world of suffering.
The non-existent and existent form a perfect sphere;
Soon, one shall ascend to the Great Luo.

The jade nature gleams, illuminating the clear sky,
Originally non-action, summoning fortune and wisdom.
The mysterious principle flows freely, truly at ease;
The wondrous light, limpid and clear, roams at will.
A single note of celestial music ascends the golden palace;
Two streams of numinous spring irrigate the auspicious sprout.

Recognize the original true face, rely on the master and become the bridge for saving others.
The principle of causes and conditions—
Meeting the master breaks open good affinities,
Impartial toward all things, in harmony with Heaven above.
Fivefold radiance gathers in the wisdom-nature,
Myriad hues of rosy clouds cluster in the cinnabar field.
A pure tone beyond the void conveys the true essence,
Amidst the waves of the bitter sea, the Dharma-boat plies.
No certification, no cultivation—truly complete,
The original merit and practice are naturally perfect.

Dwelling in dust yet unstained—
Vacuity congeals into elegance, forming the numinous embryo,
Though in the world of dust, the Dao-eye opens.
Wine, lust, anger, wealth—others’ livelihoods,
Yet spirit and blood-vessels root in the self.
Let the primordial sea dwell together,
As Kunlun’s heights freely traverse to and fro.
This cause and condition is truly certain,
Non-action and purity reach Penglai.

Two Self-Chants

Eastern clouds and seas, a gentle breeze,
All day in non-action, speaking of suffering and emptiness.
A single point of perfect clarity, truly complete,
Twice encountered, the nature melts in fusion.
The three fields forge the elixir of longevity,
Nine years’ cultivation perfects transcendent merit.
Often gazing toward the celestial path of primordial dawn,
The light of Perfect Realization illumines the Great Luo Palace.

Lead and mercury merge to form the Great Elixir,
Consumed, one instantly regains youthful countenance.
The physical body harmonizes yin and yang’s reckoning,
The true nature transcends life and death’s barrier.
The eight meridians flow with the sea of primordial qi,
Myriad spirits gather on Jade Capital Mountain.
Revolving and repeating, arrayed anew,
The Heavenly Perfected of the Limitless freely come and go.

Two Instructions for Disciples

Especially for fellow travelers, pointing to superior affinity,
From beginning to end, the will remains steadfast.
In quietude, subtly aiding the truly real,
In warmth and fullness, all affairs must be relinquished.
Further, act sincerely among people,
Like the evergreen lotus in fire.
Clouds and rosy clouds guide steps toward the primordial,
When merit is complete, the three thousand and great thousand worlds are attained.

All the lofty and wise together form affinity,
In the depths of the bitter sea, golden lotuses are planted.
Emerging from dust, fragrant and resplendent, free from all filth,
Illuminating the body, radiance shines upon the nine heavens.
From the outset, the true Dao-eye is revealed,
Cultivating the supreme Perfected of the Great Luo.
Transcending past and present, the true numinous nature,
Complete and clear, not a single Dharma is transmitted.

The Immortal Realm

The immortal realm, towering and inscrutable to the world,
Filled with rare fragrances and jade dust.
Rainbow banners and crimson tassels pay homage at the golden palace,
Feathered canopies and cloud flags reflect upon jeweled terraces.
The sagely Perfected of the three realms gather in assembly,
The youths of the five directions linger in long reverie.
Unchanged through ancient and modern times—who can perceive it?
Only those with the Dao-eye opened through spiritual communion.

Perfect Realization

My master propagated the Dao, establishing Perfect Realization,
First encountering Pure Yang, receiving the secret texts.
The nature fills the void, congealing luminous brilliance,
The elixir perfected, inside and out, auspicious clouds form.
Instantly transcending the Dharma-realm, leaving the mysterious teaching,
Transforming humans and heavens, praising the sagely sovereign.
Delivering all beings from myriad sufferings,
Naturally, the world and seas universally know and hear.

Encountering the Master’s Transmission

I once encountered a living immortal,
Nurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure sky.
The heart enters the crimson palace, obscurely illuminating,
Qi exhales into the cinnabar furnace, naturally revolving.
Form and spirit both wondrous, locked in mist and rosy clouds,
Movement and stillness both forgotten, nature and life complete.
Universally wishing the world to comprehend this principle,
All at once, together boarding the boat for saving others.

Two Gifts for Fellow Daoists

In pure poverty and gentle weakness, the face delights in redness,
The original nature, carefree, yearns for the orthodox lineage.
Further wishing to gather the spirit, investing within,
Then abandoning the false, awakening to true emptiness.
The numinous source firmly secured, without any leaks,
The divine sword brandished, slaying the nine worms.
Refining cinnabar to perfection, understanding the fire’s timing,
Sitting and watching the crow and hare, freely east and west.

Heaven’s harmony, earth’s principle, and human peace,
The three teachings and three talents are all the same.
The nature-candle’s light, ever bright and unwavering,
The numinous youth leaps in joyful pursuit.
Floating clouds disperse, the zenith of meditation clears,
External affairs embraced, the sea of awakening widens.
Unrestrained and carefree, observing self-so,
The original countenance forever beheld.

Answering a Question on the Method of Peace and Bliss

The great Dao of vacuity, the secret of Perfect Realization,
Surpassing wealth for the nation and peace for the people.
Liberating the numinous palace, myriad transformations arise,
The harmonious sea of qi dispels a thousand ailments.
Stability transcends the great leakless divine boat,
Rolling forth into the autumn night’s moonlit sky.
The nature, perfectly bright, the Dao naturally completes,
Revolving and repeating, arrayed anew.

For the Newly Departed from the Household

Turning the head to seek the path to the Eternal Capital,
Internally and externally, completely empty, sweeping the heart.
Utterly exhausting schemes, reaching the profound and obscure,
Drawing and adding water and fire, illuminating inversion.
Refining the four images and three talents,
Expelling the seven emotions and six wastes.
A single nature, radiant, illumines the great void,
On Jade Capital, naturally, the golden scripture reports.

Two Instructions for Disciples on Proofreading Merit and Practice

Exhorting and transforming, the will in affinity remains firm,
Exerting the heart, all are as I am.
The golden pass unlocks, the mysterious wind penetrates,
The iron tree blooms, the great Dao is transmitted.
Subduing the myriad spirits, all rejoice,
Reporting through three lifetimes, free from calamity and transgression.
The friends of the ten directions should seek and obtain,
Awakening to true emptiness, all become immortals.

A naturally singular realm, truly vast,
Accordant with the principle of the subtle and obscure.
Nurturing the nameless, pure and tranquil body,
Transforming without destruction, the profound and obscure lineage.
Banners and streamers, flashing, arrayed in the cloudy Han,
Jade girdle pendants, tinkling, descend from the great void.
Receiving and guiding, perfectly bright, truly complete,
The Dharma-wheel constantly turns, circulating the mysterious wind.

Two Poems on Creation and Transformation

Wondrous practice and true merit, complete in ten years,
Universally uniting with the Dharma-Dao, refining true immortals.
Gently, the lead furnace’s divine light bursts forth,
Vividly, the numinous cinnabar’s fire timing is complete.
The twofold mysterious wind penetrates the mountain’s peak,
A single stream of cold jade descends upon the mushroom field.
Splitting open chaos to observe the limitless,
Expansively, the numinous root nurtures the vast and unconstrained.

Preserving the body, pure and elegant, tiger and dragon roar,
Silently, true compassion turns through ancient and modern times.
The Supreme Ultimate’s original lineage opens creation and transformation,
From the outset, the mysterious image flows in ascent and descent.
The spirit gathers the five viscera, evil cannot enter,
The nature extinguishes the three corpses, the Dao naturally seeks itself.
After a single great elixir ripens,
The precious flower, perfectly round, emerges from the jade peak.

Dharma Kin

On Jade Capital, the immortal kin, my heart’s fellowship,
Fortune bestowed, prosperity flourishes, misfortune does not befall.
Hell transforms into a hall for transmitting the Dao,
The fire pit becomes a bridge for delivering immortals.
Leisurely listening to the Dharma-drum resounding on the numinous peak,
Then readying the cloud chariot, sailing the purple empyrean.

The Primordial Beginning sheds its radiance to broadly deliver salvation,
The Chaos-Origin wanders freely through the Three Realms in carefree ease.

**Preface**
Ahead, the purple phoenix dances in cloud-light,
Behind, the azure simurgh leads the way to the Emperor’s realm.
The Seven Treasures’ Grotto-Heaven is ever unclouded by night,
The Ninefold Purity’s rites and methods spread universally.
The Five Phases and Four Images clearly harmonize in prosperity,
Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, calamities are extinguished.
Two substances merge to form the flawless body,
One numinous true nature reaches the vault of heaven.

**Leaving the Dust**
Leaping from the wheel of rebirth to enter the Dao,
Profound mechanisms silently fill the breast.
Suddenly transcending all inner and outer dust-nets,
Never falling among the cliffs of myriad sufferings.
A single point of spirit-light, without lack or leakage,
The four false things may sink and bury themselves.
One day, riding a crane to ascend to the Origin,
Returning once more to the Heavenly Palace, treading the jade steps.

**Bestowed upon the Commander of Yidu**
Originally but a single point of true void,
Descending to the Middle Kingdom to become a worthy minister.
Might extended to distant frontiers, boundless affairs,
Loyalty aiding the pure court, employing utmost benevolence.
Not apart from the Jade Yang’s joyous assembly,
Often in blessed lands, forging good causes.
After a hundred years, surely a divine immortal guest,
Virtue ever renewing, day by day.

**Composed in Taihe, Xin-You Year, on Journey to Bozhou for the Universal Grand Offering**
The Sage Emperor transmits the talisman from the Grotto-Heaven,
At the Golden Gate, the teachings unfold boundlessly.
Greatly flourishing the wondrous offerings, causes universally spread,
Eternally preserving the grand foundation, firm as sea and mountain.
Joyously celebrating the Great Peace in unison,
Revering and perfecting virtue in all completeness.
Beneath the Supreme Purity Palace, together participating in the rites,
This must be the fourth proclamation of imperial grace.

**Two Poems Exhorting the Assembly to Raise Alms**
Hearing that the various lords broadly raise alms,
Do not shun honor or disgrace, diligently refine yourselves.
Nurturing spirit in harmony and ease, cultivating together,
Cultivating will in tranquility and contentment, fitting with nature.
Expounding the pure and void, observing the moon of nature,
Revolving creation, dancing the embryo-immortal.
Having realized truth, silently all is without leakage,
Unmoving, the light of compassion fills the great thousandfold world.

With resolve firm and heart serene, universally raising alms,
Each repays vast vows, burning incense smoke.
It is fitting to seek the Dao’s principles, reawakening,
Better to cast aside worldly passions all at once.
The five viscera radiantly bloom with jade buds,
The three fields surge forth, spouting golden lotuses.
The precious scriptures of the ten directions soar into the void,
One nature universally ascends to the ever-bright heaven.

**Exhorting People to Abandon the False and Return to the True**
Relying on form, entrusting transformation, depending on past causes,
Karmic retribution presses near, affairs compel and distress.
The precious mirror and spirit-pearl suffer obscuration,
The wind’s lamp and stone’s fire are not enduringly firm.
Good sirs, best to cast aside the wheel of rebirth,
With single-minded resolve, preserve nature and life.
Gathering and refining light, turning inward to replenish,
Awakening to truth, returning to the root, restoring wholeness.

**Sent to Mother**
Mother and child cultivate truth, leaving the household together,
Embodying heaven, modeling the Dao, making this their livelihood.
Transforming and enlightening, everywhere divine spirits assist,
Exhorting goodness, repeatedly, blessings and longevity increase.
Worldly ties and affections are not to be discussed,
The Dao Gate’s virtue and power remain forever unerring.
Within, the numinous ascends and transforms, joining the true,
One day, with merit complete, boasting of Penglai Isle.

**Exhorting the Assembly to Cultivate Within and Without**
Within, evading the wheel of rebirth; without, saving the busy,
Externally upholding, internally illuminating—both without hindrance.
Aiding causes, aiding teachings, meritorious deeds manifest,
Supporting the distressed, rescuing the imperiled, lifespan lengthens.
A single golden lotus, free of filth and defilement,
Two jade countenances emerge from Kunlun’s ridge.
Timely celebrating the sovereign of peace and prosperity,
Secretly spreading clouds of compassion across the ten directions.

**Bestowed upon the Daoist Disciple, the Thousand-Household of Weizhou**
In the past, layer upon layer, forming superior causes,
Heart’s incense wafting, penetrating all heavens.
Within the dust, nurturing the true suchness-body,
Within the fire, ever-blooming, the unfading lotus.
Universally vowing to seek truth, ascending the far shore,
Each must broadly take vows to extinguish past transgressions.
When the elixir is round and fruit is full, spirit-light gathers,
All attain the non-doing,契合自然.

**Two Poems Bestowed upon the Palace Eunuch Bureau’s Director**
Goodness in giving life, the Dao-heart thick,
No need for superficial splendor, misapplying effort.
One’s own polishing and refining, heart’s filth cleansed,
One day, preserving the inner countenance’s red glow.
Constantly practicing loyalty and filial piety, without private crookedness,
Naturally, divine spirits will point to the true lineage.
Unawares, escaping the sea of birth and death,
Throughout the ten directions and three realms, displaying the family’s style.

Boundless grace, rare from ancient times to now,
Awakening to worldly passions, all is not done.
Accumulating virtue, taking refuge in the supreme Dao,
Piling merit, eliminating self-deception.
Myriad spirits surge forth, transcending birth and death,
One nature, thus and thus, unmoving and unshifting.
One day, riding a simurgh to roam the Purple Palace,
Donning the six-zhu robe, receiving heavenly blessings.

**Two Poems Bestowed upon Daoist Assembly Arriving from Afar**
Fellow Daoists, knowing the tune, come and go freely,
Scriptures journeyed, sacred waters traversed, a thousand mountains crossed.
Washing the heart, wondrous discourse penetrates the profound,
Severing thoughts, distant light investigates inner leisure.
Before the golden and jade hall, simmering phoenix marrow,
Within the mist and rosy clouds’ grotto, refining the yang pass.
Pure wind and bright moon, the true void-body,
Awakening to principle, clarifying the lineage, in an instant.

Utterly expelling worldly roots, not a single thing remains,
Pure and cold, applying effort.
Pale light, vast and distant, opening the heart’s moon,
Crimson radiance, shining brightly, covering the nature’s pearl.
Having attained the original primordial, truly understanding the stem,
Let the four great elements scatter without constraint.
When merit is complete, receiving heaven’s decree,
Steadily riding auspicious clouds to the Jade Capital.

**Parting from the Daoist Assembly**
Cultivating truth, exhorting the Daoist assembly, earnestly,
Do not follow the wheel of rebirth, dying and being born again.
All worldly passions may be severed,
Myriad dusty affairs are not worth contending.
Body and heart harmonious and easeful, a thousand ailments disperse,
Spirit and qi surging and merging, the four seasons balanced.
When all is understood, there is nothing left to understand,
In the mysterious, mysterious, mysterious—attaining perfect completion.

**Composed for the Heavenly Toxin Festival’s Offering**
Diligently cultivating the Yellow Register, initiating true explanation,
Countless officials and people pray for ten thousand years.
Universally conducting sincere devotion, offering blessings,
Together practicing true filial piety, surely reaching heaven.
Incense smoke wafting, transcending the Three Realms,
Meritorious virtue towering, penetrating the great thousandfold world.
All sentient beings ascend the Dao’s shore,
In the era of Great Peace, joyfully encountering good causes.

**Relying on Li Shouqing to Transform Wood and Plant**
Noble scion Li, do not shirk difficulty,
Benevolence and righteousness open the gate of life and death.
The great treasury’s causes are not trivial,
The Dao Gate’s messages are good to pursue.
Increasing blessings and emoluments, relying on conduct,
Preserving and nurturing form and spirit, keeping inner leisure.
With single-minded resolve, without selfishness, heaven and earth comply,
Good roots’ light coalesces, ancient countenance preserved.

**Chen, Lady of Anqiu, Leaving the Household to Seek Teaching**
Coming to dwell in the pure court’s Dharma Plum,
Departing to wander Penglai Isle, not in vain.

Hungry, feast on the inner treasure of true primordial essence;
Thirsty, drink of cinnabar clouds where jade nature glows red.
Qi circulates through the pure and tranquil body,
Myriad spirits gather in the Crimson Empyrean Palace.
Reversing age and transforming substance, free from decay,
Opening transformation for humans and heavens, the true ancestral founder.

**Requesting Master Hui to Repair the Hall**
Master Hui discerns ancient and modern texts with clarity,
Like Master Kuang, his deep hearing keeps his nature undimmed.
Learn from me to roam carefree, gazing at the moon’s jewel,
I wish you fierce resolve to sever root and dust.
Two sagely emperors of successive dynasties opened the immortal’s path,
A single举 of the mysterious canon enjoys the Dao’s grace.
The four great elements wander the earth as conditions allow,
Expounding the pure and tranquil, a fine family tradition.

**To the Assembly at Shuichegou, Rizhao County**
The waterwheel irrigates, sprouting new Dao shoots,
Gradually emitting numinous light that pierces the purple imperial court.
The two qi’s root and origin complete creation,
Branches and leaves fill the sky, brushing the stars.
Exquisite rosy clouds traverse the three realms,
Exultant and perfectly luminous, emerging from the six dusts.
Having forged the original true countenance,
Through the master’s enlightenment, you awaken to the Perfect Real.

**To the Magistrate of Anqiu County**
Anqiu’s mountains and waters are most limpid,
Especially moved by loyal and good governance of this city.
Harmonious people delight heaven and earth,
Abundant harvests fill granaries to overflowing.
For your impartial uprightness without selfish crookedness,
Everywhere songs of joy celebrate Great Peace.
When your merit in aiding the state and loving the people is complete,
Strive to exhaust the Dao and virtue to fulfill your destiny.

**To Aunt and Mother-in-Law on Cultivation**
Both aunt and mother-in-law speak of the Dao with deep devotion,
Yet must not indulge in extravagance, lest it all come to naught.
First awaken to true cultivation, forgetting self and other,
Do not let external seeking lead you east and west.
Qi and spirit long to attend the Primordial Sea,
The monkey and horse must be locked in the Crimson Palace.
Subduing all demons without hindrance,
Roam carefree and at ease, completing the immortal’s work.

**To Liu Yanchong and Wang Renmei of Wenshan, Building Danxia Abbey**
Yanchong and Renmei, each of lofty wisdom,
Erect Danxia Abbey with renewed resolve.
Wenshan in the eastern sea is a true ancient site,
The western Qin’s ancestral master had good karmic causes.
Perfecting external conduct, embracing the empty realm,
Merging mysterious work, transcending worldly dust.
Further lifting all vanities in one grasp,
Turn your head to become a person of the inner truth.

**To Qing Yuanchong of Guanxi, Ritual Master of Ninghai**
Purely dwelling in Ninghai, arrayed in cap and robe,
The summit of Penglai’s isle is your homeland.
Secretly studying the cinnabar classics, exhausting creation,
Safeguarding numinous treasures, sparing sorrow.
Burning incense to pray for longevity, merit never lost,
Repaying virtue and requiting kindness, the Dao naturally flourishes.
Movement and stillness harmonize with heaven and earth’s principles,
One day on cloud steps, you will pay homage to the Void Sovereign.

**To the Two Masters Song of Laiyang**
A letter sent to the two immortals Song of Laiyang,
Old friends in office must be precise and devoted.
Recently, in several places, you have performed purification rites,
Hasten to come together to forge a superior karmic bond.
Do not treat diligence as worldly affairs,
You must know that purity plants golden lotuses.
The Perfect Real’s inner and outer works perfectly gathered,
From ten thousand miles, the returning light pierces the azure heavens.

**Purchasing Chashan’s Upper Clarity Abbey**
In the eastern sea’s clouds, visiting all masters,
Each vows to establish the cinnabar and become ancestral founders.
The three realms and ten directions communicate a single transformation,
All under heaven’s multitude of sages expound true emptiness.
Heaven and earth bestow vast blessings,
Auspicious affairs and long life manifest good merit.
Delivering and saving humanity, vast is the great Dao,
Passing down and opening enlightenment, a fine family tradition.

**Instructions to the Assembly**
The assembly for cultivating the real has profound trust,
Spreading prayers, the primordial great Dao is opened.
Without, transforming and giving life, a leisurely livelihood,
Within, refining and forging, a fine family tradition.
Clear sounds, distinct, piercing the Milky Way,
Jade nature, numinous, speaking the orthodox lineage.
Transmitting and reporting to the world’s bright and attentive,
In the eastern sea’s clouds, witness perfect integration.

**Two Poems to Magistrate Li Mingwei**
Having knocked at my gate to seek the Dao’s stream,
Do not let ignorance pass the seasons.
Sun’s essence and moon’s marrow, gather in due time,
Mercury marrow and lead essence, exert effort to collect.
Assemble all spirits to attend the Jade Emperor,
Reopen the wisdom eye to behold the jade tower.
With the elixir’s completion, inner and outer ascend and descend as one,
The non-doing one smiles and nods.

Cleansing the heart, refining within, a wheel of light,
Expounding the Dao, opening the real, filling the ten directions.
Accumulating virtue, even gods and ghosts revere,
Nurturing the real, do not be harmed by worldly passions.
Yin and yang’s inversion, people scarcely perceive,
Nature and life’s perfection, the world cannot fathom.
The dharma realm’s numinous clarity, all thoroughly penetrated,
Boundlessly soaring beyond the heavens, naturally taking flight.

**To the Assembly Building the Abbey at Wenshan**
Embodying heaven and following the Dao in cultivation,
Heaven, earth, and humanity’s ethics are harmonized as one.
If you move with sincere resolve, never retreating,
You will decisively awaken to the mysterious principle of non-birth.
Ge Hong’s ten thousand scrolls ultimately return to the Dao,
Hui Shi’s thousand boxes idly count the journey.
How could it compare to a single leap onto the real ground,
Where the original merit and virtue naturally perfect themselves.

**To Younger Brother Sui on Cultivation**
Purify body and mind, nurturing qi and spirit,
Refining metal and jade, emerging from the sea of delusion.
In the three fields, secretly plant the medicine of years,
One day joyfully encountering the deathless person.
Five-way heavenly light, shining and sparkling,
Six-yang earthly qi, issuing and circulating.
Steaming and permeating joints, penetrating flesh and bone,
Certainly attending the Primordial, paying homage to the Purple Imperial Court.

**To Erlang, Who Withdrew from the Dao**
At first entering my gate, all admired,
Who knew you lacked the share to become a true friend.
The azure empyrean’s path is distant, the years near,
The black ledger’s name high, hell’s depths profound.
Fan Li and Zhang Liang are not easily learned,
Cauldron’s boiling soup and sword trees are not hard to find.
In the future, you will suffer merciless pain,
Regretting your mad and reckless heart.

**Lu Xuanwu Inquires of the Dao**
A single qi’s ascent and descent merges the great elixir,
Only then knowing the numinous treasure naturally returns.
Gathering and storing the precious jade, returning to the central position,
Picking and stirring heaven’s mechanism, infusing the inner visage.
Light bursts from the nine palaces, observing the world,
With the Dao’s completion, eternally ranked among immortals.
Riding a green simurgh, steadily soaring into empty space,
Henceforth, your pure standard will guard the sea and mountains.

**To the Diviner**
Exhaustively investigating heaven’s principles, most distinct,
Especially to resolve the world’s difficulties.
Discerning yin and yang’s timely prosperity and decline,
Able to comprehend the sun and moon’s waxing and waning.
Following the nine luminaries’ course, calamities befall,
Reversing the three yangs’ changes, misfortune does not invade.
Do not wait until the inconstant heavenly limit arrives,
When all, wise and foolish alike, fall into the deep pit.

**To the Assembly of Shanghe County Seeking Teaching**
Shanghe truly encounters the returning light,
Step by step, the mysterious wind pervades the homeland.
Cloud paths intersect, the sky vast and boundless,
Yin demons disperse, the nature brightly manifest.

Clear tones echo sharply, startling mountain spirits,
Divine radiance gathers round, filling the jade hall.
Once departing the dusty world beyond,
Penglai’s eternal coolness is attained.

**To Zhang Zhenguo of the Capital Inquiring on Cultivating the True**
Luminous clarity held within the heart’s embrace,
Firmly rooted, delving deep with careful effort.
Guard the treasure, lest other things steal it,
With no-mind, dwell in the world’s dust as one.
Concealed subtleties reveal true suchness,
Mending and cherishing essence, the Dharma Sea empties.
Auspicious traces and immortal tracks never cease,
Clearly ascending straight to the Great Luo Palace.

**To Elder Zhang, Boatman of Northern Qingzhou, Who Asked**
A single oar, an empty boat crosses the world,
Lightly drifting along cloud paths among the immortals’ ranks.
Wielding numinous brilliance, the golden crucible gathers,
Grasping yin and yang, the jade ring turns.
Forever emerging from vast waves, leaving the sea of love,
Brandishing the sharp sword to cleave the mountain of affection.
In Penglai and Langyuan’s immortal realms,
With a single thought of heart’s ashes, all may be scaled.

**To Disciple Nanlü Ge**
Search the root-source of kalpas past,
Know this as the fine cause and reason.
A thousand auspicious hues gather in the cinnabar valley,
Ten thousand streams of silver mist flow against the current.
The golden and wooden river chariot carries phoenix marrow,
The guiding and fire stove refines the frost orb.
When the celestial cycle is complete, the divine elixir forms,
Five-colored majestic light clusters the Ten Isles.

**To Ren Ge of Sizhou Inquiring on the Great Matter of Nature and Life**
The harmonious union of nature and life is not difficult,
When karmic obstructions are exhausted, light arises and the Dao comes and goes.
Steady breathing, unbroken, connects to the true principle,
Calm spirit, silent, seals the mysterious pass.
Gathering true brilliance, the elixir must coalesce,
Shattering emptiness, the nature is naturally at ease.
A single spark of numinous light transcends creation,
The cloud chariot bears it to Jade Capital Mountain.

**To Xu Shangya of Putai County**
The four great elements of the body are but empty float,
Borrowing the false to cultivate the true holds another reason.
The supreme Dao, subtle and imperceptible, knows no extinction,
The original spirit, untrammeled, does not linger.
The gentle lead crucible bursts with golden light,
The tranquil spirit palace gathers jade flames.
A master stands before you,
Meeting, you clap hands and laugh without end.

**Instructions to Disciples**
In emptiness and purity, establish the golden altar,
Sweep aside the wheel of rebirth and the gate of life and death.
Emotions and nature harmonize like still water,
Qi and spirit intertwine like a returning ring.
The luminous pearl shines beyond the clouds,
The crane’s chariot drifts lightly beyond the world.
Until reaching the Great Luo Heaven’s realm,
Return in due time to restore your true countenance.

**To Sun Si of Changjian, Laiyang**
A letter sent to the worthy Sun Si,
Gently refining our family’s tradition.
Clear and discerning, body and mind purified,
Cold and serene, affairs and things emptied.
Subtly and continuously, fulfill great filial piety,
Awake and aware, return to the cloud palace.
May you, sir, join forces to propagate the true teaching,
Universally transforming all to awaken to the orthodox lineage.

**To the Assembly of Dengzhou Visiting Sacred Waters**
Dharma kin and kindred spirits come and go freely,
Cloud-roaming sacred waters, traversing many mountains.
Temporarily leaving the hundred knots of the dusty net,
Often knocking at the secret gate of profound mystery.
True wisdom arises from the nature,
In the crucible, the ancient countenance is recognized.
Releasing the entire body, letting go of all thoughts,
This is carefree ease and leisure.

**To Wang, Elder of Ninghai Prefecture, Who Served as Jiao Chief**
Consider carefully before you now,
Having encountered this fine opportunity, act accordingly.
Household prosperity flourishes through virtuous deeds,
The fortune star descends, surely dispelling misfortune.
May people be fortunate to support the mysterious teaching,
Learning my non-action to reach the heavens above.
The rise and fall of the four seas are all transformed,
Establishing the teaching, hell becomes heaven.

**In Response to the Prefect of Ninghai’s Repeated Summons**
Incense never ceases, repeatedly summoning,
Willingly tending the heart to nurture auspicious sprouts.
Restraining the wicked through virtuous governance,
Comforting the old and young, praises resound.
Constantly receiving the imperial court’s gracious light,
Your loyal heart and blessed conduct shine forth.
Hoping that when merit is complete and fame achieved,
You too may come to the grove to discuss carefree ease.

**To the Public Examination at Mingshui Palace**
Heart spirit delights in awakening to true constancy,
Day by day, selflessly reaching the heavens above.
Do not cling to Confucian doors seeking outward display,
Better to search the principle and cherish original yang.
The roots of ten thousand dusts severed, transcend the three realms,
A single effort’s success pervades the ten directions.
Try comparing your future prospects,
How does serving as an official compare to reaching the immortal land?

**In Response to Zhao Zhifa of Yizhou Inquiring on Cultivation**
Cloud traces unbroken, auspicious yang unfolds,
Awakening to worldly ties, the heart turns to ashes.
Only sensing the pure qi within the body,
Gradually seeing the three powers gather in the crucible.
Green Dragon and White Tiger roar and howl,
Red Phoenix and Dark Turtle battle and contend.
Arrayed around the celestial circuit, they meet in unison,
When the Dao is accomplished, purple script will surely summon.

**To Yang Dumu, Fundraising in the Capital for the Teaching**
Assisting conditions, all things come in due time,
In the capital, radiance unfolds again and again.
Undaunted by hardship, accomplishing good deeds,
Surely encountering good fortune, far from calamity.
The old temple, once ruined, is rebuilt,
Fading good qi is once more cultivated.
Deeply grateful for the sagely grace and meritorious power,
May you pray for vast blessings equal to Heaven’s Terrace.

**Parting from Daoist Assembly Arriving from Afar**
This morning, parting from those known,
Universally transforming humans and heavens everywhere.
If you understand the crucible’s communion with sun and moon,
You will transcend the void’s bounds, stepping on clouds and rainbows.
Not yet returning to Peng Isle to attend the true sages,
For now, in the dusty world, deliver the deluded.
Good and evil, right and wrong, all unclinging,
Let the crow and hare run east and west.

**To Zhang, the Kitchen Attendant of the Cultivation Temple**
In the kitchen, Qinghe’s resolve is upright,
Do not allow waste, carefully complete your work.
Precision and reverence always delight the immortals,
Frugality gathers a hundred virtues.
Having turned toward the field of blessings, constantly nourished,
Naturally, the heart-ground is forever at ease.
When your merit is complete and you leave the dust,
A single divine pearl will at last be seen.

**[Seven-Character Ancient Poem]**
*For the nun of Xu Fu’s Temple, who disfigured her face and severed her nose in devout aspiration for the Dao*

Disfigured face, severed nose—resolve grows firmer still,
To sever worldly ties and bind the Dao’s affinity.
One touch of the root-source surpasses all ranks,
Twofold vows pierce the azure heavens.
Three Lights secretly illumine, awakening numinous wisdom,
Four Great Harmonies—gradually the Dao is transmitted.
Fivefold radiance blooms, perpetual as endless day,
Six Pāramitās unfold golden lotuses.
Seven emotions extinguished, perfect clarity gathers,
Eight Grotto Immortals together receive the decree.
Nine-curved luminous pearl threads through the crown,
Ten-directional worlds freely traversed.

**Sea Market Poem with Preface**
Temporarily parting from Dongmou, I journeyed west to Deng Prefecture, gradually approaching the ancient Huang Xigao. There, I witnessed the sea market’s suspended radiance manifesting marvels—truly in accord with the Dao.
Thus it is said: Heaven and Earth release their essence, the great Dao unfolds. Donning the Three Lights, it descends; receiving the primordial qi, it ascends. Myriad transformations arise among humankind, yet none know its way.
It nurtures all heavens, the earth’s harmonious balance. Through the four seasons’ heat and cold, it illumines the vast firmament, giving birth to mysterious images. Merging with the root-source of the ten thousand dharmas, it aligns with the eyes and vision of the Great Luo.
Hence, borrowing Su Dongpo’s rhyme to express my feelings.

Crystal palaces lock the clear sky,
Myriad forms limpid within the azure sea.

Within the moon, the Lady Heng gazes into her jeweled mirror;
Amid the sun, the Immortal Child plays in the Pearl Palace.
Heaven and Earth revolve, revealing the luminous truth,
As primal chaos reopens, surpassing all craftsmanship.

Ten thousand rays of fine light gather round the Kan tiger;
A thousand strands of crimson qi envelop the Li dragon.
Across the sky, the sacred host upholds the circular canopy—
Jade maidens and golden lads attend the Master.

Where purple mists and rosy clouds just unfurl,
The intricate Seven Treasures display their majesty.
A divine wind, silent yet startling mountain spirits,
Myriad transformations intermingle—none in the world can fathom.

Light overwhelms water and sky, leaving no force to resist;
My true self, through the Three Realms, attains harmony.
With mind released, the world knows no hindrance—
Across the Four Great Continents, how many cups are drunk?

Though Su Dongpo was a true superior man,
One must know that great stillness surpasses the Yuanfeng era.
All the heroes of past and present, those who "hook the giant turtle,"
Care not for mud, sand, or shattered iron and bronze.

By cultivating the Dao to govern the body, with merits complete,
One joins the family style of the Great Luo Heaven.

Following the previous rhyme:

The Primal Three Realms look down upon the empty void,
Where hidden, in vast seas, rise immortal mountains.
Harmonious qi flows forth, birthing auspicious images;
Pure winds and bright moon penetrate the numinous palace.

Heavenly boys and heavenly maidens arise from emptiness;
Crimson towers and jade pavilions transcend mortal craft.
Within surging waves, the jade tiger is born;
Amid raging flames, the vermilion dragon races.

The Lord of the Mud Pill Palace drums the heavens;
The Perfected of the Purple Court dance as drunken elders.
Gathered, the myriad spirits celebrate in unison,
Soaring through the Eight Directions to display their purity and power.

They wield the divine elixir that parts past and present,
Splitting the void—yet the principle knows no end.
Eternally transcending creation, achieving long life,
Luminous, formless, they attain perfect harmony.

Thus, for a hundred generations, they ascend to the celestial river,
Receiving boundless grace beyond ten thousand cups.
Aiding the unfolding of the Mystery Gate, upholding the Inner Teaching,
In this pure age, they delight in true abundance.

The immortal embryo and Dao bones dwell in the dusty realm,
Like fine gold mingled with tin and bronze.
Only when the Purple Writ personally summons,
Will our family style at last be revealed.

[Seven-character quatrain]
Abiding in the Dao...

The golden essence and jade marrow form the immortal embryo,
Along the spine, two luminous paths unfold.
The crown is bathed in ambrosia, giving rise to ten thousand phenomena,
As the sun and moon’s twin beams irradiate the jade terrace.

Subtly enduring, ever-present—
Recognize the dynamic stillness of emptiness and non-being,
The flowing essence and precious jade bestow boundless rewards.
Revolving endlessly, arrayed anew,
The immortal’s melody resounds through the vast heavens.

Return to simplicity, embrace humility—
The root source, free from leakage, ensures eternal life,
A thousand-petaled golden lotus gleams with the sun’s brilliance.
Heart and nature, clearly understood as one,
The Great Dao of mystery and tranquility naturally achieves perfection.

The gentle lead crucible—
A single qi, pure and void, gathers the myriad spirits,
All spirits converge to behold perfect clarity.
Within and without, celestial radiance coalesces,
Sealing the proof of Penglai, transcending life and death.

Light pierces the eaves and curtains—
Pure Yang ascends, transforming and soaring to the heavens,
Releasing divine light to nourish the auspicious lotus.
The Dao’s qi circulates through midnight and noon,
Osmanthus flowers blaze with boundless illumination.

Creation’s forces contend—
Between the twin kidneys, wind and rain roar,
Dragon and tiger race as the crow and hare flee.
The elixir pellet enters the abdomen, startling gods and ghosts,
The earth’s demons and grasses all bow in submission.

Dragon and tiger unite—
Five-colored celestial light reveals its true form,
The void and non-being operate in profound obscurity.
Where Jade Yang arrives, immortal songs resound,
Golden lotuses step forth, shimmering across the heavens.

Clear and turbid divide—
Following the qi’s flow, behold self-mastery,
Embracing the wind’s song in drunken harmony.
Within the realm of cool purity, divine light blazes,
Gradually turning toward the void, the Great Dao opens.

**Duke Wang asks how to study the Dao and transcend life and death**
The primordial qi of emptiness congeals the divine elixir,
Unlocking the gate of rebirth and the cycle of life and death.
Delivering the ten directions from the Three Realms’ suffering,
The true nature of the single spirit returns of itself.

**He further asks how to embody Heaven and follow the Dao**
The Great Dao does not depart from the process of transformation,
Swift as thunder, yet effortless in its natural workings.
Pursuing this principle reveals all as one body,
Responding to the worlds of humans and heavens without fail.

**Bestowed upon disciple Wang Ge**
Shatter the mountain of self and others in cultivation,
Transcend the mundane, cut off all going and returning.
Maintain impartiality, ever upright in heart,
One day you shall ascend to the azure heavens.

**Zhang Gong inquires about sudden enlightenment**
The Dao is empty, formless, without a single thing,
Yet it responds to conditions, delivering all beings.
Reuniting with the Lord of Heaven’s Primordial Kalpa,
All ten thousand cycles of rebirth are instantly understood.

**Wandering**
Leisurely observing mountains and waters, roaming Peng Isle,
White clouds blanket the earth, the wind sweeps of itself.
Quietly reflecting on the toil of fleeting life,
Who can cultivate this path to escape decay and aging?

**Attaining the Elixir**
The crow flies, the hare flees into the center,
In the dim and wondrous source, the wondrous method is found.
A single grain of the elixir pellet completes the nine transformations,
Ascending and transforming to fill the vault of heaven.

**Awakening to Truth**
Awakening brings earnest joy in true recognition,
The crown bathed in ambrosia, the qi expands.
The Great Dao’s harmony flows through midnight and noon,
The inner divine light rolls forth from the mud pill.

**Pursuing the Dao**
Clear and turbid rise and fall, ever returning,
Drowsy and silent, words fail to express.
The twin eyes need not gaze upon the celestial patterns,
Ears and nose, spiritually attuned, absorb the essence of the embryo.

**Following Transformation**
Upside-down and cyclical, like a drunken man,
Neither sorrow nor joy, the inner truth remains whole.
Where spirit and energy move, divine waves surge,
The Three Realms are pure and void, free from specks of dust.

**Returning to Truth**
Penetrating the root source, a single point runs deep,
The spirit terrace nurtures the golden lingzhi.
Golden light surges, transcending life and death,
The jade nature shines, illuminating past and present.

**Saving Lives**
To save the empty body from great calamity,
The cycles of rebirth and death cannot contain it.
The divine spring’s sacred water flows through the mysterious valley,
The four seasons’ immortal flowers bloom within fire.

**Nurturing the Dao**
Long ago at the Eastern Sea, I first met the true,
Grateful for your guidance and care, O enlightened lord.
Now I await the Purple Edict to return to the immortal capital,
Turning the jade door’s lock to enter the golden gate.

**Transmitting Goodness**
When merit is complete and conduct perfected, ascend to the origin,
Do not overstep the pure age to forge bonds with all.
May the deluded universally return to the Supreme Dao,
Aiding in the cultivation of true blessings without end.

**Illuminating Radiance**
All stand at Danyang’s miraculous stele,
The immortal’s traces, wondrous and mighty.
Encompassing the subtle and profound, surpassing past and present,
Mending the mechanisms of creation’s primordial workings.

**Attaining the Root**
With an empty heart and full belly, intent focused,
Seize the horse and capture the ape to seek the enlightened immortal.
Practice the Great Dao in purity and non-action,
No need to earnestly inquire of the azure heavens.

**Recognizing Taboos**
Throughout the twelve hours, the child of good and evil records,
Transcribing names and deeds to present to Heaven’s Lord.
Assessing merit and conduct without flaw,
The immortal ranks are surely attained without fail.

**Female Daoist Liu Zhimiao of Huang County asks about daily practice**
Diligently investigate daily practice with keen effort,
Every glance turned inward perfects a hundred deeds.
Refining the self, forging truth to magnify the Great Dao,
The path ahead will naturally extinguish all transgressions.

**The Four Assemblies Open and Transform**
The seven-jeweled golden lotus exudes auspicious qi,
Jade splendor and impartiality are our family’s style.
The Three Pure Lords communicate true virtue,
A single stream of radiance shines everywhere alike.

**In Reply to the Summons from the Seven Treasures Assembly of Wendeng**
Deeply honored by your summons to build bridges,
Discoursing on the method of birthlessness and deathlessness.
The seven-jeweled golden lotus blooms in unison,
The celestial assemblies’ fragrance fills the empty sky.

**Mr. Liu Seeks the True Formula of the Three Treasures**
The entire body’s light congeals the purple golden elixir,
One must attain spiritual clarity to recognize inner leisure.
Mastering the true oral formula of the Jade Field,
Gather the spirit in one thrust to pass the Three Passes.

**The Assembly of the Golden Lotus Seeks Instruction**
The Dharma assembly arises from the Dao’s nature,
Planting golden lotuses in the depths of the bitter sea.
The gentle lead crucible’s divine light bursts forth,
Rolling out cinnabar to irradiate the azure heavens.

**Returning to Harmony**
Return to the root, restore the origin, and reach the natural,
The void and purity transform into golden lotuses.
Fusing the Four Great Elements, the heart’s elixir forms,
Ten thousand rays of rosy light emerge from the grotto-heaven.

**Comprehending Truth**
From within the golden treasury, turn the body to emerge,
A single point opens the jade splendor of Yao Pond.
Wind and moon drift beyond the heavens’ bounds,
In movement, stillness, sitting, and walking—this is Penglai.

**Bestowed upon Liu Ku of Renshou, Fushan**
Through the ages, true compassion establishes great merit,
Only now, across the Three Heavens, does the encounter occur in haste.
Joy and honor gradually reveal the profound mystery,
Attaining this method, one knows the Dao’s unity.

**[Sent to Master Danyang]**
In the fifteenth year of the Dading era, a disciple first vowed
To journey west to seek Master Danyang.
The master said: Why travel afar?
One day, we shall meet here.
Yet I cannot dismiss your resolve,
So I compose this quatrain to send to Master Danyang.

Upon arriving there and unfolding to behold it, the words divulge celestial secrets—later, he indeed returned east.

**In the East of Shandong Province, True Cultivation Abides**
Wood virtue neighbors, the hare frets in vain.
One-two-two-three linked as one-two,
Nine suns’ radiance brims, flowing eastward.

**For the Daoist Community on Their Observances and Journeys**
Daoist practice and immortal arts are sought within the heart,
Do not drift with the waves, chasing the turning flow.
Escape the bitter sea of love’s river,
A single point of numinous light reaches the shore-bound boat.

**For Chief Lian of Dengzhou, Who Requested a Eulogy on Filial Dao**
Heaven and earth’s emptiness bears nurturing grace,
Leaving home, one must recognize the root of the Dao.
Dragon’s roar and tiger’s cry reveal true splendor,
The maiden, the infant, and the youth cherish the Most Revered.

**Bestowed Upon Disciple Yu Liaoyi**
Without innate numinous bone, vainly cultivate immortality,
Only by grasping the origin does one know the Dao’s spontaneity.
Seal the mouth, forget scheming, cut off seeing and hearing,
The primordial visage may then be preserved whole.

**For Master Yang, Who Requested a Poem on Guarding the Dao**
From the outset, guard the essence of the sun’s brilliance,
Secretly sow the field of mushrooms to nurture auspicious sprouts.
Gradually penetrate the mysterious pass, surge past the crown,
Filling the void, light congeals into purple-golden sand.

**Revering the Three Teachings**
The three teachings flourish together, relying on all conditions,
True emptiness, wordless, laughs in unbroken sound.
Opening wide the Dharma-eye, the profound principle is complete,
Layer upon layer of lotus leaves serve as the ferryboat.

**Renouncing the Mundane to Enter the Mysterious**
Utterly sever worldly attachments, not a trace remains,
Naturally formless, the work begins.
Clearly gather the four seasons’ primordial scenes,
The undifferentiated three lights coalesce into six grains.

**Ode to the Stone Mushroom of Zhashan**
Sun and moon’s essence congeals into an auspicious sprout,
Mysterious light and true qi inwardly enfolded.
It nourishes the five viscera, generating golden liquid,
Secretly fortifying the entire body, flesh and bone grow firm.

**In Praise of the Strict Reverence of the Yellow Register**
Star altars and moon halls overflow with fragrant winds,
Phoenixes walk and simurghs soar amidst jade dragons.
Praise stirs the Three Heavens, all sages descend,
Delivered souls all tread upon immortal traces.

**Bestowed Upon Wang the Second Elder of the Le’an Pharmacy**
Shennong’s *Ben Cao* is not the true treasure,
The celestial zhi and orchids’ flavor knows no end.
Better to grasp the divine elixir, transcending worldly medicine,
On the mountain’s peak, heal the master himself.

**For the Novice Immortal, Who Requested the Method of Guarding the One**
A single point of numinous clarity recognizes the true origin,
A wheel of bright moon eternally gazes upon.
The body’s spirit and qi manifest auspicious signs,
The single nature soars, myriad transformations rest in peace.

**Bestowed Upon the Daoist Community of Northern Qingzhou**
Daoists who leave home, carefully ponder:
All may recognize Penglai as their native land.
Gather spirit to depart the sea of suffering,
Release the heart-moon to nurture harmonious light.

Prayers shake the Crimson Empyrean Palace.
Immortal hosts gather, veiled in deep mist,
Great Virtues of the pure court expound the Orthodox Dao.

The gate of the Mysterious Teaching seals the clouded heavens,
The Four Greats harmonize their light within the still station.
The gate transforms the heavens’ true and wondrous Dao,
Drawing spirit into the bright moon and clear wind.

Reverently composing myself, settling the divine radiance,
Closing my eyes to hear the sacred words in detail.
I humbly pray the Heavenly Emperor endure ten thousand myriad years,
Turning to the Three Treasures, knotting auspicious blessings.

*Bestowed Upon the Young Attendant*
Unbroken imperial grace sends forth this edict,
Bestowing a numinous youth to serve the sacred intent.
Gazing upward, I thank our August Emperor’s power and virtue,
Who commands the repair of Daoist abbeys and the meticulous observance of fasts.

*Ascending the Altar in Purple Robes to Perform the Offering*
Flying dragons and running tigers descend from heaven,
Light fills the golden altar as the purple feast unfolds.
Entering the cavern’s Jade Pool, descending from emptiness,
Rising and sinking, heaven and earth return as one.

*[Gift to the Imperial Relative]*
In the eighth month of the Wushen year, granted leave to return to the mountains, passing again through Cangzhou, where the Fourth Imperial Relative requested a Yellow Register Rite for salvation.

Auspicious clouds overflow, filling the vault of heaven.

*[Verses Received in a Dream]*
At the Divine Waters’ home abbey, in a dream, this quatrain came.
Seven days later, the edict was proclaimed again.
The Purple Palace’s Perfected One urges the jade path,
Immortal hosts gather, swift as thunder.
Light fills the void, revealing jade and jasper forms,
A golden writ of command comes and goes of its own accord.

*[Urgent Imperial Summons]*
Emperor Shizong fell ill, and recalling this master, dispatched a close attendant of the imperial clan to Divine Waters Jade Void Abbey with orders to hasten by four-horse chariot.
In the mid-autumn of the eighth month, granted leave to return,
Roaming the grotto-heavens at leisure.
In the twelfth month of the Wushen year, summoned again,
A four-horse light chariot urged day and night.
Arriving at the capital on the third day of the first month of the Jiyou year, Emperor Shizong had already passed on the second day. The young lord ascended the throne, and the imperial messenger dared not present himself, thus returning to his former abode.
The late emperor ascends in rosy clouds, the realm weeps in ten thousand directions,
How could his vast grace and profound virtue be forgotten?
Ministers dared not memorialize the present court,
So he turned his cloud-traces back to his native land.

*Requested by the Assembly of Officials*

Spiritual essence traverses the empty realm, incense wafts apart,
Above, praying for imperial grace to reach all directions.
Rejoicing in great peace, teachings are uniformly established,

The living and their kin receive vast blessings.
Knowing the true sages’ protective grace,
Do not idly pass the years in deceit.

*Requested by the Court Assembly of Officials*
In this era of clarity, qi stills heaven and earth,
Boundless longevity is wished for the august sovereign.
The Four Seas all cultivate the supreme Dao,
All under heaven repay the sagely and enlightened grace.

A thousand schemes and devices are ultimately empty.
Only numinous clarity remains unbroken,
A hundred years pass like a ball of wind at hand.

*Gift to the Daoist Assembly of the Two Hermitages at Donghua, Encountered on Kunlun Mountain*
Donghua awakens, diligently cultivating and upholding,
Only through encounter can one plant purple zhi.
Here and now, never depart the realm of purity,
In time to come, together we shall attend the Jade Pool.

*Inward Illumination*
A single point of numinous clarity knows itself,
Do not seek falsehoods outside, recklessly driving forth.

The true瑞 of primordial Heaven differs utterly.
The root-source awakened nature lies abandoned,
Vainly spinning through samsara in a dream.

Snow-white lotus blooms from the heart’s soil.
Wishing you awaken to truth and refine within,
Cultivating a hundred practices to attain perfection.

O assembly of Lulü, sink not into obscurity,
Inwardly illumine the Three Lights, nurturing the candle of nature.
True transformation arises spontaneously, free from suffering and calamity,

**Caution**
From youth I admired the pure and void, soft and yielding,
Unconcerned with worldly paths, I sought no trace or reason.
Only the dread of birth and death, with no gate to escape,
I leaned alone on empty mountains, seeking the ultimate truth.

**Encountering the Master**
Suddenly I heard of a lofty Daoist arriving in the mountain prefecture,
The Three Teachings interlinked, I searched along one path.
The myriad dharmas and worldly dust were utterly extinguished,
In grass robes and wooden bowls, I契d with true cultivation.

**Taking the Master as Teacher**
Predestined affinity, heart-to-heart exchange—once met, all was resolved,
Master and disciple, having realized the truth, need not tarry in words.
In the Jade Hall, we gathered in the patience of non-arising,
The mystery’s mechanism concealed, we smiled and nodded.

**Expressing Aspirations (Two Poems)**
The great Dao originally transmits not a single dharma,
Awakened, I clap my hands and point to the azure sky.
The numinous nature secretly merges with the void,
Only then do I perceive radiance filling the great thousand.

Transformation gives birth to the heavenly Dao, freely and unfettered,
In the mysterious valley, auspicious omens dance the *liuma*.
Daily cycles purify the cosmos,
Realizing that from level ground one ascends to the azure heavens.

**On the Twenty-Second Day of the Twelfth Month, Fasting and Recalling Danyang**

The painted image at Changyang reveals his wondrous traces.

**Responding to the Invitation of Chaoyuan Gong in Cangzhou (Two Poems)**
The Yellow River overflows, inundating all directions,
Living beings everywhere suffer its ravages.
I hasten to the Chaoyuan assembly to converse,
Urging the swift practice of the Yellow Register to supplicate the vault of heaven.

A solitary heart, a single point, forges bonds of knowing,
Beyond the world, my pure name grows ever more exalted.
When the inner elixir’s radiance fills to the full,
The Dao perfected, the ancestral master emerges from the heavenly hosts.

**Upon Perfecting the Work**
The great elixir’s radiance fills, naturally piercing the heavens,
I guard this provisional body, awaiting the sage’s summons.

Internally, I pay homage to the supreme Great Luo Immortals.

**Sending the *Yunzhong Record* and This Poem to Lady Jinzi**

The primordial Dao, minutely and exquisitely sought,
The entire body’s radiance flows above and below.
Having refined and perfected it, you encounter deliverance,

Further, burn heart-incense to penetrate bone and flesh.
Rescuing the yin prisoners from suffering and calamity,
Sincerity naturally receives the Dao’s support.

**For Wang Ge of Juzhou (Two Poems)**
A single qi stealthily pervades the myriad transformations’ glory,
Filling the void, it scatters the light purple haze.
Grasping the true heart-medicine of heaven and earth,
Clapping the void to pieces, the Dao forms itself.

Osmanthus fragrance diffuses, filling the void with scent.
To rejuvenate countenance and transform substance, no other matter,
Having ingested the *daogui*, it is naturally efficacious.

**Exhorting Liu San to Establish Himself**

**For Lu Huishou of Laizhou (Two Poems)**
The lotus palace of Penglai, no birth to rely upon,
From the beginning, how does a single thing attain numinosity?

The heart’s fragrance flows forth, congealing true auspiciousness.
The three disasters and five sufferings scatter with the wind,
A hundred refinements of harmonious qi, cool day and night.

Recognizing the original, formless thing,
A single wheel, round and radiant, emerges from the jade peak.

**For Xu Gong’s Request for an Oral Formula**

**For Pang Ge’s Discussion of the Dao**
A lump of unrefined ore, never polished,
Snowy blade and icy edge speak of honey’s sweetness.
The foul and rotting skin-bag—call it “not two,”
The rank and filthy viscera—make them heaven’s harmony.

**For Zhang Wudao of Jinan’s Request**
Not in frequent questioning of Yuyang,
Each must search their own life and destiny in detail.
The immortal medicine of the mysterious palace, the origin-attaining formula,
The heart-pearl of the Dharma sea, the Dao-perfecting method.

Universally proclaiming the teaching, filling all directions.

**For Liu Daweng of Hu Village in Muping**

The heart’s completion ascends heaven’s ladder.
The numinous treasure of emptiness reveals its perfect light,

Devotees come and go without cease,
Passing the transmission, expounding true emptiness.

Each year on the third day of the third lunar month,
Sacred waters gather the noble and grand.
On this day, Daoist companions request teachings—

Sincere in prayer for blessings, undeterred by toil.
Concerned for life and death, we discuss and inquire together,
Expounding the great causal conditions, transforming all once more.

Wishing to graft anew the withered root,
Worldly affairs turn the heart to ashes.
Former perverse qi departs the body,
Boundless divine radiance enters the belly.

Deeply grateful for your gift of fine fragrant tea,
Together we vow to nurture the auspicious sprout with distant light.
A single thunderclap divides creation,
Jade nectar and liquid jasper irrigate cinnabar sand.

Three cycles have turned since I last visited old friends,
Eight or nine of ten—how sorrowful to behold.
Luminous waters shimmer, resplendent and bright,
The Dao’s transformation renews itself day by day.

**Sent to Master Qiu of Changchun**

Master Changchun’s high recommendation arrives,
Hasten to respond, spared further urging.

Filial sons and obedient grandsons together offer blessings,
Newly departed, distant transformations—all ascend to heaven.

Once you cast the hook to angle for the great leviathan,
Stirring the vast sea, roiling with furious waves.
If only there is affinity to meet and aid,
None who follow fail to join the immortal court.

**For Little Cui of Wendeng, Whose Parents Consent to Leave Home but Do Not Release Him**
Leaving home brings blessings to both sides,
Yet stubborn ignorance does not exhaust the heart.
A single trace of worldly sentiment remains unsevered,
Thus violating heaven’s Dao, the root of sin runs deep.

**Fundraising for the Three Clarities’ Warm Curtains at This Abode**
Renovation requires the convergence of many conditions,
Thus we establish fields of blessing among the people.
Wishing further to turn the light inward, seeking the subtle and wondrous,
Only then will inner and outer winds be universally complete.

**For Director Yang**
Director Yang, with utmost devotion, holds the Dao’s thought deep,
In the teaching’s gate, he has a share—knowing the tone.
Adding to spirit, supplementing life, radiance gathers,
Retreating from ambition, forsaking the rest—calamity will surely come.

**Two Poems Seeking Teachings in the Chan Gate**
True Chan, true Dao—give rise to true merit,
True goodness, true compassion—true suffering, true emptiness.
True joy, true leisure—true ease,
True cultivation, true refinement—revealing the true wind.

True heart, true attainment—true delight,
Straightforward practice of true merit, making one cluster.
True awakening, true mystery—true clarity,
True emptiness, true transformation—eternally true peace.

**This Abode’s Letter Urging Return Home**
The conditions elsewhere are rich, the return delayed,
Everywhere the causes run deep, the departure slow.
In general, it does not depart from propagating the teaching,
This body’s movements and pauses submit to the flow.

**Two Mid-Autumn Poems**
In the eighth month’s mid-autumn, day and night grow cool,
Revolving and returning—this is the original true constant.
Heaven and earth open, the flawless treasure,
A single qi, clear and serene, reveals Yuyang.

Autumn clouds disperse, the azure sky clears,
A single cold light arises within the sea.
Illuminating through the jade pot, divine brilliance coalesces,
The three fields flow and circulate, naturally perfecting themselves.

**Completing the True**
Having completed the true, one becomes a Great Luo immortal,
Yet still inquires among people to universally transform and gather.
Seeking the leviathan to present to the Emperor,
Shaking the floating world, descending with weighty proclamation.

**For Master Zhang, Who Sent Fermented Sauce**
Yin and yang’s essence and refinement emit divine radiance,
Attaining the method, harmonizing—one flavor endures.
Universally exhorting the world to follow this way,
If consumed, one remains forever cool and clear.

**For Master Zheng**
Worldly entanglements, things upon things—do not exhaustively pursue,
A thousand kinds of use and expenditure are all ultimately empty.
Searching the true source, the pure sovereign,
Suddenly, one still sees the wind of one’s own family.

**For Qiu, Wang, Jiao, and Three Unruly Boys**

A sudden wild impulse seeks to leave the home,
Foolish and stubborn, years pass in vain.
Why so unruly, so hard to tame?
All stems from roots where fortune never came.

**Three Poems for Magistrate Chen of Gu County**

All dharmas are empty—do not guess in vain,
From the primal origin, a speck beyond all dust.
Like a lotus rising pure from water’s face,
Its subtle fragrance drifts from far away.

The Dao transforms the Three Powers: heaven, earth, and man,
Who can grasp the root and restore the true?
Do not waste in humble dwellings, aging in vain,
Begin the work to perfect the self beyond the self.

To transcend the world and ascend the true is not hard,
With all ties unobstructed, the belly grows vast.
The Three Palaces circulate the elixir of years,
The Seven Treasures refine the pill that remolds the bones.

**For Master Zheng of Mount Lao**

Steadfast in will, serene in heart, dwelling on Mount Lao’s peak,
Beneath the flowering canopy, immortals of old refined the great elixir.
Countless ridges and peaks lie deep in shadow,
Naturally, worldly affairs do not intrude.

**For the Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner, Seeking Teaching Due to Illness**

From ancient times, birth and nurture follow the Dao’s constant way,
Yet how can people all turn from this path?
Not cherishing the original, pure sovereign within,
How can this colored body ever know peace and health?

**Twelve Poems Expressing My Heart**

The formless Great Dao gave birth to me,
Its mysterious principle flows from Kunlun’s height.
The Three Lights pour forth their true radiance,
A single blazing qi transforms jade-like yang.

Non-being and being—Dao’s eternal truth,
Each step through fragrant flowers spans the ten directions.
Great awakening fills heaven and earth with numinous light,
In motion, stillness, sitting, lying—behold the Three Lights.

A speck of numinous light opens within the void,
Coming and going in emptiness, no wheel of rebirth.
Embracing sun and moon, it links past and present,
Nameless and primal, it moves as it will.

Through kalpas vast, its radiance stands unmoved,
Embodying heaven, following the Dao—non-action’s way.
Naturally, it refines the true Three Treasures,
Giving birth to heaven and earth, all transformations hang.

Suddenly, harmonious qi sprouts the Dao’s shoot,
Gradually, true qi congeals into cinnabar.
The Three Powers and Four Images reverse their course,
Then you know Penglai is your true home.

Bearing such numinous things, the body rests in truth,
Grasping round brightness, recognizing the inner face.
The primordial spirit leaps beyond creation,
Lightly striking through the Three Passes.

Formless radiance illumines the inner truth,
Before heaven and earth, it sets the good cause.
With a pure heart, the gods and spirits meet,
A single golden elixir emerges from the six dusts.

Leaping beyond the wheel of creation,
True sages fill the empty sky, arrayed in clouds.
The ten directions and three realms await your roaming,
With each step, celestial light rolls the jade altar.

Recognizing the primal speck of numinous light,
No cultivation, no action—no birth to complete.
Merging with the Great Dao’s true emptiness,
Step by step, carefree, you ascend to Jade Capital.

The sea of awakened origin gathers the spirits,
All things return to one transformative birth.
To restore the root and return to the sea of awakening,
With non-action’s work complete, you naturally achieve perfection.

Radiant light gathers around the numinous spirit,
A thousand-petaled golden lotus blooms beneath your feet.
Escaping the suffering of the ten directions and three realms,
Without effort, you perfect yourself.

Awakening to truth, penetrating the root, wisdom’s root opens,
The alchemy of sincerity expounds suffering and emptiness.
Prajna-paramita—no hindrance,
The subtle and imperceptible Great Dao is wholly fused.

Treasure-light fulfilled, desires wither,
All floating splendor fades like an empty glance.
Refining the golden elixir without calculation,
Where among immortals is there not thusness?

**Inscribed on the Stone Bridge of Weizhou**

Seven apertures exquisitely meet the jade spring,
The Dharma Bridge’s vast passage—I am the same.
Who can fathom the shifting of past and present?
For the sake of those in the world with karmic affinity.

**Facing the Moon**

Within the realm of true emptiness, the azure sky appears,
The precious mirror never wavers.
If you grasp this as body and function,
Then you know the spirit’s nature is inherently luminous.

**Two Poems Inscribed on Yun’guang Cave**

Long ago in Yun’guang, the great elixir was refined,
Once completed, in an instant, youthful countenance returned.
Above, entreating the Lord of Heaven through kalpas vast,
Below, delivering beings from the wheel of birth and death.

Sun and moon fly in exchange, shooting forth purple mist,
Clear and void, bright and boundless, piercing the ends of the sky.
Opening the Dao-eye, few can recognize,
Suddenly, you realize Penglai is your home.

**For Disciple Han Daowen, Who Returned to His Hometown to Issue Public Documents**

Golden flowers and jade buds form the spirit-embryo,
With unwavering resolve and pure strength, a separate stage.
The golden bones refine open the true jade nature,
Transforming into formless birth, never buried.

**For the Two Elders, Mu and Liu, of Fushan and Moucheng**

A speck of true emptiness—no place to guess,
Each plants the magic mushroom within the heart.
All around, golden lotus seeds are sown,
Naturally, in due time, the Dao-eye opens.

**For Disciple Wang Shouzheng**

Light bones restore youth, standing at the origin,
Pure tones and wondrous conduct reach the limitless.
Returning to the origin, a speck opens true nature,
The spirit leaps forth, dazzling the Great Void.

**For Li Zhiquan, Dwelling in White Dragon Cave**

The white dragon enters the belly, transforming birth,
Myriad celestial lights open the kalpa’s vastness.
Sun and moon rise and set before your eyes,
Sitting, you clearly glimpse Penglai.

**Farewell to the Officials and People of Yutian County**

In the *gengwu* year, the Master was in Yutian County of Jizhou. After the ritual concluded, he addressed the crowd: "The Dao’s qi of the north is about to return. In the empty sky, spirits and deities come and go, clashing blades and striking—surely the people are about to suffer." He composed a poem to bid farewell to the officials and people. Soon after, the northern frontier saw turmoil.

The Great Dao’s radiance turns as one,
Cloud formations in ten directions, stars in swift flight.
Heaven and earth display their true signs,
Worldly affairs and floating splendor—mere specks of ash.

**Lamenting the World**

Worldly beings do not awaken to the Dao’s root,
Born and transformed in heaven and earth, responding to things’ mechanisms.
Grasping this subtle and wondrous essence,
Naturally, spirit and qi reach the profound and minute.

**Two Poems for the Thousand-Household of Juzhou**

A single stick of heart-incense reaches Supreme Clarity,
The wondrous Dao of non-action gradually achieves perfection.
Hanging high, the precious mirror—dust cannot obscure,
Illuminating the path ahead, bright through ten thousand kalpas.

From the void, a single qi gives birth,
Heaven and earth, yin and yang, form the embryo of excellence.
Through kalpas vast, the true visage transcends creation,
In the azure sky, phenomena hang free of the slightest dust.

**Two Poems Inviting the Assembly to Bathe in the Southern Stream of Sacred Water Cave**

All should go to the bathing pool,
Shedding worldly dust, dissolving delusion and doubt.
Each holds fast to purity and clarity for cultivation,
Through a thousand ages, thus and unmoved.

**For the Assembly, Washing Away Filth**

The great assembly should all go to bathe,
Stripping away defilement, ending confusion.
Each with refined spirit, engage in refinement,
Eternally thus, never shifting.

When emerging from the bath, freed from filth and radiant,
Each person reveals a form without the slightest blemish.
Washing clean within and without, body and mind purified,
A single point of true emptiness follows every step.

**Proceeding to the Mountain for the Offering Ritual**
From the bitter sea’s ceaseless toil, escape is hard,
Yet where truth is realized, incense altars spread.
Climbing mountains, fording streams, no complaint is voiced,
To deliver the living and the dead—this vow is vast.

**In Gratitude for Magistrate Gong’s Gift of Peppermint Pills from Guozhou**
A single elixir, like ambrosia poured upon the crown,
Revives a thousand ages’ finest countenance.
Fragrant essence, vibrant and spiritually bright,
Pierces the wheel of rebirth, breaking the gate of life and death.

**Non-Contention**
From ancient times to now, how many changes have there been?
Yet none escape arising and ceasing—true accord lies in non-contention.
Few indeed awaken to non-contention’s truth,
But once grasped, the Dao is instantly fulfilled.

**Three Poems for the Divine Youth**
A single, unwavering heart from beginning to end in leaving home,
A luminous body shines through past and present.
Gradually penetrating the spirit-terrace, surging past the crown,
Returning to the wondrous Dao—rare are those who understand.

A radiant jade flame, a single elixir pill,
All emerge from the heart-field, gateway to myriad transformations.
Completing immortal merit, mastering the Dao’s path,
Serenely seated on Red City Mountain in perfect peace.

Breath harmonized, all transformations flow freely,
True emptiness emerges beyond being and non-being.
Mysteriously aligned with virtue and the Dao’s eternal principle,
All rests within the towering nature of the One.

**Parting from Dengzhou**
Clouds gather, mist unfurls—a fine time for leisurely wandering,
Having entered perfection, now the cycle begins anew.
The Great Heavenly Net’s true guidance is clear,
Thus, with this understanding, I depart from Dengzhou.

**Two Poems for Li, Vice-Director of Laizhou, Who Contemplates Leaving the World**
Shedding the mundane, delving into the profound—this you know well,
From the very beginning, a single point aligns with heaven’s mechanism.
Within my gate lies the secret of immortal cultivation,
Will you, Master Xianwu, follow or not?

Bearing witness to the Three Treasures as your life’s work,
Heaven and earth’s harmonious qi nurtures the sun’s essence.
Worldly fame and achievement—all thoughts abandoned,
When the numinous frost congeals into purple-gold cinnabar.

**For the Vice-Prefect of This Prefecture, Seeking Atractylodes**
Fashioned from the radiance of sun and moon’s flowing light,
It replenishes flesh and bone, gradually making them light and pure.
Able to gather the four seasons’ spiritual luminosity,
It seizes the immortal elixir, giving rise to wondrous transformations.

**Matching a Poem by Zhang, Palace Examination Graduate**
My resolve, sharp as a blade, severs the dust of ten thousand concerns,
True practice and true merit enrich creation’s bounty.
Refining the precious pearl, I transcend the world’s snares,
Roaming freely in the Great Heavenly Realm.

Regardless of age, engage in true cultivation,
Each unfurls the tranquil oar to reach the other shore.

Dwelling forever beyond the heavens—most refined.

**Admonishing Disciples to Examine the Mind-Ground**
With mind and eyes serene, examine within,
Amid the clutter of worldly affairs, discern true auspiciousness.
Gathering spirit and nurturing qi—this is merit and practice,
Let worldly matters, one and all, take their short or long course.

**For Guo, Licentiate of Wenshan, Seeking the Elixir**
If you seek the bone-transforming elixir of long life,
Swiftly cast aside worldly concerns and set the mind at ease.
In stillness, recognize the true message,
And break free from the wheel of rebirth, the gate of life and death.

**For Song Shaoweng of Chashan, Who Donated Scriptures for the Offering Ritual**
Establishing the fast, teaching the rites, and copying sacred texts,
Removing sins and transgressions—there is sure reliance.
Universally aiding the departed with the Dao’s power,
All escape karmic suffering and attain liberation.

**Emptiness and Being**
Ethereal clouds and mist—emptiness upon emptiness,
The inner master of heaven’s Dao is the source’s root.
Yet clinging to emptiness, one is still obscured by emptiness,
While following being, one is again veiled by being.

**Lamenting Delusion**
East to west, seeking the true explanation,
Yet one’s own numinous clarity remains incomplete.
The ten thousand dharmas and conditions are like ten thousand images,
Know that all are but a single heaven.

**For Master Yang of Dace**
A single point of non-arising merges with the boundless,
Nurturing harmony’s light through conception and transformation.
With deep karmic affinity, awakening to the Quanzhen truth,
The fragrance of the Dharma-Dao spreads everywhere.

**On Disciples’ Silence**
The hundred practices pivot on the five constants,
The teaching of non-speech fills the void with fragrance.
Quietly observing the true and wondrous mystery,
In stillness and obscurity, the principle runs deepest.

**Remembering the Two Masters Song of Laiyang**
The crane’s chariot and cloud carriage—no word comes,
When will they return to the Jade Void?
By the pine window, rain passes, zither and books are quiet,
All day long, no one to speak of the original teaching.

**Exhorting the Practice of Filial Piety**

Refining truth, shedding falsehood, transforming into cool purity.

By noble command, we were invited to this prefecture,
The ritual feast prepared, vast and all-encompassing.
With sincere resolve, accumulating true merit and virtue,
Together we journey to Penglai, gazing upon the ten isles.

**After the Ritual for the Thousand-Household Official of Mizhou, Who Invited Me as the Yellow Register Master of Salvation**
Pure integrity and filial piety startle gods and spirits,
Supplicating the myriad heavens, gathering the ten thousand spirits.
Sacred water and sweet unguent universally bestowed,
Sunken souls and lingering spirits emerge from dark nether realms.

**For the Officials and Merchants of Mizhou Who Sponsored the Restoration of Youde Abbey**
Reviving Youde is no difficult task,
Foreseeing harmonious qi already returning in cycles.
From beginning to end, unwavering—merit perfected,
With a share in the immortal ranks, ascending to the upper echelons.

**Exhorting the Assembly to Engage in Cultivation**
Join forces, unite hearts—do not complain of hardship,
Revive the blessed land, convene the immortal altar.
Vying in merit and practice, ascending through the cloud ranks,
Wherever the eye falls, selflessly, the elixir silently forms.

Master Captain wearies of worldly dust,
With cinnabar sincerity and protective virtue, forging good causes.
In this, offerings and provisions are amply provided,
Fortune and blessings have always been bestowed upon the auspicious.

Ten thousand kinds of beings in the bitter sea,
Alas, who will establish immortal merit?
Fortunately, the Quanzhen truth points the way,
Wherever you cultivate, the Dao is fulfilled in unity.

**After the Ritual for the Various Princes, Addressing the Assembly**
Formless and non-acting—a single point of truth,
Universally offering homage to the Great Heavenly Honored One.
The myriad spirits rejoice, receiving liberation,
Emerging from the prison of yin and the five sufferings’ gate.

**Instructing Disciples**
Light suffuses the body, illuminating the chamber,
A perfect wheel of radiance, without waning or waxing.
Only then do you know this is the true primordial ancestor,
Forever freed from sinking and rising, responding to transformations.

**For Cui Daochang of Mizhou, Who Fiercely Left the World**
Abandoning the mundane, entering the profound, awakening to the constant Dao,
Turning the heart to protect the inner light.
Refining open the ancient true numinous nature,
Immortal blossoms unfading, their fragrance everywhere.

**Answering a Question on the Three Treasures**
Of old, the Three Treasures—qi, spirit, and essence,
All gather in the primordial field, each with its own cause.
When light fills the ten directions and the elixir is complete,
In the Great Heavenly Realm, the immortals take their place.

**Four Poems for the Assembly Seeking Instruction**

The Dao originally has no name, beyond all external seeking,
Within the numinous terrace and cinnabar valley, search with utmost care.
The five passions and six desires all dissolve,
Ten thousand rays of light flow in reverse.

Great awakening, wisdom—all things fade away,
Freed from the dust-net, you reach the primordial beginning.
The Three Fields’ numinous treasures gather in radiant fullness,
A single strain of pure song resounds through the Great Void.

Worldly emotions, piled high, cut off from sinking and burying,
The pearl of true awakening gradually unfolds.
Illuminating the original source, the pure and undefiled body,
Awakening to truth, returning to the root—fit for immortality.

The entire body’s light merges with the Great Elixir,
Balanced harmony reverses age, restoring youthful countenance.
Carefree and at ease, in true joy,
You feel yourself ascending into the azure heavens.

Dejing’s heart is pure, delighting in leaving the household,
Suddenly transforming mortal bones to nurture cinnabar.

Giving birth to a numinous youth, praised beyond the heavens.

**Two Poems for Yang Dianshi**

For a thousand ages, clouds disperse, the vast sky clears,
The true瑞 of prior heaven arrives in an instant.
The inner numinous light scatters, the elixir without leakage,
A single point of pure emptiness—through the Great Dao.

Lifetime after lifetime, the sprout of good roots,
Awakening to principle, illuminating truth, passing the years.
Merit and conduct unblemished, penetrating Dao and virtue,
One day you will return, treading upon clouds and mist.

**Admonition for Wei Zhiming**

**For Zhang Erlang of Haiyang County, Songzhou**

Zhang Erlang of Haiyang County in Songzhou expended his own wealth and goods to purchase an abbey plaque and ordination certificate, petitioning to establish and oversee an abbey. He then appointed his disciple Wei Zhiming to serve as its keeper.

Embody heaven’s virtue, spread power in accord with conditions,
With a pure heart, establish abbeys in all directions.
Aid beings, pity mortals—Dao naturally fulfills itself.

**Two Poems for Little Wang Xian of Dengzhou, Who Sought Teaching While Ill**

Heart-incense fragrant, ascending to azure skies,
Dharma-sea’s radiance nurtures the auspicious sprout.

A thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes dissolve as one.

In jade crucible and golden furnace, refine the sun’s essence,
The true refinement soars, the River Chariot in motion.
Myriad spirits gather within the Mud Pill Palace,
Piercing the Heavenly Gate—yet this is not yet cause for praise.

**For Li Daoyi of Xihai Village, Laizhou**

The lamp of wisdom shines, illuminating the ancient visage,
Awakening to principle, penetrating truth, reaching the heavens above.

Beyond this world, the purple mushroom’s fragrance awaits.

**Pointing Out Delusion**

The luminous ground of the heart holds profound transformation,
All rise and fall according to karmic conditions.
Yet none awaken to the principle of non-arising—
Vainly they struggle through samsara, trembling through the ages.

**For One Who Is Ill**

If you seek the immortal’s formula in the human realm,
Cease indulging the dust-bound heart in outward frenzy.
Let love, attachment, sorrow, and worry all be extinguished—
Then the whole body shall forever abide in peace and health.

**For the Officials and People of Beijing**

In the seventh month of the *da’an jisi* year, the Master was at Huayang Abbey in Beijing.

During a prolonged drought, the officials and people of the city entreated the Master, saying: "The seedlings wither—how may they revive?" The Master closed his eyes for a long while, then addressed the assembly: "The empty sky pledges a foot of rain, to fall by tomorrow." The crowd remained doubtful, yet the next day it proved true. The officials and people expressed their gratitude, and the Master composed this verse for them:

Vast and billowing, auspicious qi reaches the vault of heaven,
Nurturing all beings, the great Dao flourishes.
Light transforms the ten directions, ever unceasing as day,
In one moment, universal relief fills the air with fragrance.

Once the work is accomplished, forever roam beyond the heavens.

□ Unbroken, the Dao completes its cycle.

The Jade Void unites in one transformation,
With each step, golden lotuses form.

**Mystery Penetrated**

Worldly affairs all dissolved,
Cultivating the true, the solitary yang is savored.

The living and the dead alike rejoice,
Merit and virtue universally complete.

**Five Poems Expressing Aspirations**

A single point of true emptiness,
Void and nonexistent, naturally comes and goes.
Its root and source deeply penetrate,
In movement and stillness, all is at ease.
In worldly affairs, each moment awakens,
Turning the light inward, all is pared away.
Ethereally, beyond the material,
One sits upright on the uppermost mountain.

Through countless lives, boundless karma,
In this life, entering the Dao’s arena.
Demonic armies all scatter,
The heart-ground reveals auspicious signs.
Across the four seas, golden nectar surges,
From the three mountains, purple light emanates.
Refining into a true jade body,
Cloud-steps traverse the vault of heaven.

Every dharma returns to emptiness,
The true heart connects with myriad transformations.
Dwelling in the vast and open,
Entrusting the nature to the profound and obscure.
Ascending into the treasury of round brightness,
Perfecting the flawless merit.

Delivering beings, surpassing the ten thousand kinds,
Comprehending the Dao, all forms are the same.
The four great elements follow nature,
True emptiness wondrously transmitted eastward.
The two modes divide creation,
A single qi naturally revolves.
The red phoenix peers into the golden tripod,
The azure simurgh drinks from the jade spring.

The heart extinguished, passions forgotten, departing illusory realms,
gathering life and nature to ascend the high slope.
The true wondrous work nurtures harmony,
embracing the One without separation, carefully refining.
The Crimson Text of the Primal Chaos transcends creation,
formless water and fire emerge from the world of suffering.
The true inner treasure severs deep afflictions,
silently crossing the Nine-Bend River of pure nectar.
Twenty-four hammer strikes forge the golden-locked bones,
the Tailbone Pass and joints rest upon the turtle’s back.
Frequently refine, let no time slip away—
sun and moon’s flowing light emerges from dark waves.
Reversing the cycle, the pure universe,
know to turn back and gaze upon the Southern Branch.
Again clear and bright, dispelling the demon of confusion,
a single orb of perfect clarity—none in the world surpass it.
Guarding the shell, filling the body to satisfaction,
not clinging to the world’s false adornments.
Golden thunder roars, the Jade Person scolds—
in an instant, the body is wholly emptied.
The Great Orthodox Teaching of the Limitless Heavens,
pervading the ten directions and Three Realms.

**[Song of Universal Salvation]**
*(To the tune of Dan Yang, with three-character lines interspersed)*
□□ three persons encounter a great meeting,
□□ life and nature rest in tranquility.
□□ within the pure, true joy is found,
□□ in mutual accord, true words spoken.
True words—
□□ lead and mercury scatter, Han Zhong and Lü.
□□ the Purple Gold Elixir is formed,
□□ within the mercury, true delight is found.
□□ spirit and qi eternally continuous,
□□ within the light, they dance of themselves.
Dancing of themselves—
□□ Chongyang dwells in humble abode.
□□ discoursing on the Dao, measuring benevolence and horses,
□□ the true Dragon and Tiger appear.
□□ turning the light back within the Three Realms,
□□ descending to the lower realms to deliver salvation.
□□ I deliver from the nether darkness,
□□ from this, departing the dusty world.
□□ the bell’s toll—no more words,
□□ inquire and return to the Purple Palace.
Return to the Purple Palace—
□□ trust and accept, not refusing.
□□ hearing of our sect’s tradition,
□□ heaven and humanity are beyond compare.

**#1 Chant**

**Chant of Attaining the Dao**

Since first obtaining the long-life formula,
The light of ten thousand miles flashes like lightning.
The essences of sun and moon mend the leaking source,
True emptiness and water-fire congeal in union.
Circulating true qi, the numinous cinnabar forms,
Dao-bones and immortal winds—azure and piercing chill.
Seven-jeweled golden lotuses gleam in the great void,
The Three Palaces brightly illumine the autumn moon.
Suddenly all dharmas open, beyond words or explanation,
The household of kalpas cannot be transcended.
From ancient times to now, this single truth endures,
All heavens gather in assembly to pay homage together.

---

**Chant of Nurturing the Vast**

Vacuous and boundless, one qi newly vast,
The Four Temporaries embrace priceless treasures.
Let not the immortal life be snared by dust,
Nor speak of bitter emptiness and hardship’s sting.
Nurture truth, cultivate nature, preserve essence’s bloom,
Gather mercury, refine lead, guard the Valley Spirit.
One qi ascends, transcending creation’s bounds,
The Two Modes transform and temper, meeting the Primal True.
The Zhou-Tian’s wax and wane yields the elixir of years,
The full Dao flourishes the wondrous colored body.
Revolving the inner elixir by fire’s timing,
Bearing sun and moon, the toad-wheel swiftly turns.
The Three Fields transform into the numinous palace’s snow,
The Five Viscera harmonize, sweet dew’s nectar flows.
The inner treasure complete—the fruit of no leakage,
Pure Yang merges, the cause of past and present.
Clear tones, distinct, stir mountain spirits,
Cloud feasts clamor, resounding by the sea’s edge.
Meeting all heavens to propagate the great teaching,
Timely encountering the Sage Emperor enthroned in majesty.
Only pray for loyal aid through a thousand autumns,
Gazing upward to bless the imperial foundation for ten thousand springs.
Great virtue, great merit—accomplishing the great Dao,
The Great Net once more gathers old friends and kin.

---

**Chant of Wondrous Transformation**

The Master of Universal Transformation, pure of heart,
Pure heart and Dao unite as one.
Sweep away each and every thought,
Let no thing be pushed to its limit.
Stabilize nature, preserving past and present,
Nurture spirit, continuing the ancestral line.
Meeting the master, the secret is personally revealed,
Silently following the cloud’s trace.
Wondrous things soar into the void,
The Mystic Pearl falls into the Crimson Palace.
Endlessly harmonizing the Jade Tiger,
Gently moving the Vermilion Dragon.
The Red Phoenix spreads golden wings,
The Azure Luan dances in the great sky.
The spirit furnace refines the jade countenance,
The golden tripod casts the vermilion visage.
Within and without, radiant light congeals,
On the cinnabar terrace, snow melts to warm crimson.
Having realized truth, transcending creation,
Bright moon and clear wind.

---

**Chant of Opening Transformation**

Non-action, purity—inner cultivation complete,
First encountering Heaven’s Origin, the Dao is not hard.
Naturally attaining the formless, merging as one,
The numinous beings of the Dark Capital lock the hidden pass.
Flaming great qi rises and falls in emptiness,
Resplendent celestial light rolls upon the jade altar.
Silent, the ten thousand spirits plummet within the void,
Towering, the Primordial Treasure connects to Kunlun.
Gathering, the Jade Maiden enters the Mystic Valley,
Assembling, the Golden Infant arrays in auspicious ranks.
Everywhere blue lotuses bloom in the full sun,
In the empty void, the mystic signs return at last.
Soaring, the Five-Colored Round Light Terrace,
Dazzling, rosy clouds gather myriad transformations.
Gently, the divine wind lightly wafts,
Numinous, the golden form adorns itself.
Clear, the precious jade lingers in place,
Pure, the numinous cinnabar delights the bones.
Silently realizing truth—no words to speak,
Brightly the full Dao’s affairs are all erased.
Mysteriously guarding the true Three Treasures,
Wondrously the work is done—a single elixir pearl.
Vast, silver clouds ever shroud,
Radiant, the jade nature pursues itself.
Floating, sleeves dance beyond the Three Realms,
Merging, the morning audience reveals the inner visage.
Bright, at ease like the autumn night’s moon,
Brilliant, ever abiding in the Jade Empyrean.
Awake, clear—immortals’ joy,
Profound, limpid—the Dao-nature at leisure.
Through kalpas, the true visage escapes the sea of suffering,
From ancient to present, the perfect image emerges from waves.
The Great Net’s assembly—together we return,
Awakening to principle, perceiving truth—observe closely.

---

**Chant of Revealing the Dao**

Myriad hanging signs fill the empty sky,
Responding to the myriad transformations of humans and heavens.
The most wondrous immortals leave secret formulas,
Know that before father and mother were born—
Yin and Yang’s creation holds the full truth of reality,
Yet this single point of numinous light remains unknown.
Chaos transforms, transcending beyond things,
The inner spirit follows each step, treading the cloud ladder.
The Primal Round Awareness—the true empty body,
Nature and life contain light, heaven and earth align.
A hundred bones become numinous, the heart delights,
The passionless youth smiles faintly.
Washing the heart with the Dharma rain, clearly irrigating,
Opening the Dao’s radiance, emerging from the mire.
Transporting pearls and treasures, connecting above and below,
Drawing and adding water and fire, uniting east and west.
The Mystic Origin’s Four Greats open the heart’s seal,
Secret scriptures and numinous texts surpass worldly marvels.
Each line strikes the marrow’s illness,
Every word directly points to non-action.
Carefree, admonishing the principle of long life,
Darkly harmonizing with Heaven’s True, unmoving.
Transmitting the Dao’s grand affinity—Master Yuyang,
Rescuing peril, lifting suffering, delivering the foolish and lost.

---

**Chant of the True One**

True filial piety, true compassion, true weighing,
True heart, true encounter, gathering true coolness.
True master, true formula, penetrating true refinement,
True conduct, true merit—true Dao-ground.
True stillness, true purity—the great true Dao,
True mystery, true wonder—congealing true auspice.
True clarity, true awakening—true no-leakage,
True words, true speech—accord with the Highest Heaven.
True Tiger, true Dragon—true creation,
True mountains, true waters—nurturing harmonious light.
True leisure, true joy—true no-stain,
True sages, true worthies—filling the ten directions.
True nature, true visage—true ease,
True Chan, true Dao—revealing true constancy.
True heaven, true earth—spreading true virtue,
True sages, true immortals—everywhere fragrant.

---

**Chant of the Azure Youth**

Silent, desolate—one intoxication,
Rustling, scattering—joyful crimson countenance.
Clear, pure—completing the truth of reality,
Silent, vacuous—guarding the inner content.
Gently, endlessly swallowing purple auspice,
Limpid, discerning—drinking rosy wind.
Full, gathering—the light of heaven congeals,
Vast, profound—establishing the ancestral line.
Encounter after encounter—transcending the other shore,
Upright, precise—speaking of true emptiness.
Numinous, charming—immortals’ joy,
Joyful, delighted—passing years in abundance.

---

**Chant of Returning the Light**

Having leisure, I return,
Cultivating truth—unmoving.
Transforming karmic ties, leaving suffering and distress,
Worthy friends become companions in knowing.
Everywhere together we discuss and investigate,
Delivering humans and heavens from delusion.
The Six Dusts unblock old obstructions,
The Three Treasures wondrously and precisely upheld.
Beyond emptiness, the mystic light gathers,
Spiritual luminaries dare not deceive.
Clear wind pervades the Four Greats,
Bright moon orders the countenance.
White-haired, preserving past and present,
Golden body encompassing the four directions.

**The Young Scholars All Bow with Hands Clasped,**
True appearances stand equal in rank.
The Dharma fundamentally abides in empty non-abiding,
True merit never diminishes.

Heaven and earth in the reigning dynasty grow still,
Sun and moon drift east and west at will.
Transformations reveal the true numinous nature,
The audience at the Origin has its appointed time.

All heavens come to bow in reverence,
The Three Realms wholly submit in refuge.
Those who awaken turn toward the true essence,
Cultivating immortality—exquisite and subtle mechanism.

From non-being emerges from primordial chaos,
Dao and the vulgar reveal the noble and base.

---

**Chant of the Mystic Truth**
*Composed upon imperial decree for the abbot of the newly established Daoist cloister*

Proclaimed to reside in the Cloister of True Immortals,
Emotions and heaven cut off external wrongs.
A young attendant, graced by imperial favor, serves as companion,
Offering two meals, sacred objects, and the elixir’s measure.

The Four Greats are all regulated,
The Three Luminaries never depart for even a moment.
The Six Dusts remain unstained,
The Eight Vessels naturally open and subtly flow.

A single phrase of the Golden Elixir’s secret
Transcends the mechanisms of the myriad transformations.
Seven lights converge in one gathering,
Nine revolutions are not difficult to know.

The Ten Grounds perfect and illumine, forming completion,
True emptiness—speaking of the ancestral foundation.
Great penetration observes self-mastery,
A single point stabilizes non-action.

Unfettered, celestial robes and emoluments,
Carefree—untethered from worldly bonds.
Transforming and generating true water and fire,
Sun and moon intertwine in flight.

Comprehending the principles of prior heaven,
Ascension has its appointed time.
Merging and clarifying—lucid and bright,
Virtue and power truly rare and recondite.

---

**Chant of Transmitting the Teaching**

The master wanders the eastern sea routes,
From this day forth, the Mystic Gate flourishes daily.
The supreme teaching upholds the sagely transformation of humans and heavens,
Dharma words beyond emptiness resonate with the *Yellow Court*.

Within the gourd, secret refinement completes past and present,
Revolving the pivot—cosmos cleansed.
Qi-transformations arise from the root of the leakless body,
A single point of divine truth—azure radiance’s essence.

Breaking open the jade treasury, connecting the Three Guests,
Releasing the perfect light to shine upon the Five Illuminations.
Thoroughly penetrating emptiness—only then is there self-mastery,
Returning to nurture simplicity—gradually the spirit becomes numinous.

Wisdom’s wind scatters a thousand afflictions,
True unity and harmony give rise to the myriad transformations.
Jeweled brilliance flows into the jade sea,
True auspices transform and refine—forming the cinnabar infant.

Yang’s addition and subtraction—heavenly light unfolds,
Water and fire’s floating and sinking—Dao’s progression.
Anointing the crown with ghee—who can fathom?
Exiting the dust’s methods—astonishing the world.

Mountains roar, valleys howl—joining heaven’s joy,
Lifting the earth—thunderous laughter erupts.
Attaining the Dao, non-action—truly lucid,
Circling and returning—naturally perfected.

---

**Chant of Seeking the Truth**

Vast and boundless—the true empty body,
Falling into deluded imprisonment—unable to discern truth.
Wine, sex, anger, and wealth erode the root handle,
Worry, sorrow, thought, and anxiety deplete the original truth.

Awakening shatters the lock between the brows,
After reflection, cultivation completes the inner truth.
Jade caves sealed in clouds—fit for nurturing vastness,
Snow-warmed cinnabar terraces—gradually perfecting truth.

A thousand layers of jeweled flames gather in the spirit chamber,
Ten thousand pathways of heavenly light envelop the original truth.
Bright moon and clear wind—one body,
Non-action and non-leakage—naturally attending the truth.

---

**Chant of Shedding the Dust**

The Great Dao transmits a small truth,
In the lower realm’s cloudy seas—encountering good causes.
Confucius’ accumulated conduct forms companions,
White-haired golden countenance—fit to be neighbors.

The Three Realms and ten directions return to one transformation,
A thousand gates and myriad methods—wondrously penetrating the divine.
Because of sealing the mouth and purifying the mind-ground,
Revolving the essence-light—daily renewed.

Myriad upon myriad numinous luminosities constantly guard,
Thousands upon thousands of phoenixes and cranes naturally draw near.
All heavens and all earths—thoroughly penetrated,
Yet unwilling to lightly transmit to worldly people.

---

**Chant of the Original Mandate**

True unity—good person,
Only virtue is the support.
Broadly extending compassion,
Rescuing the deceased, relieving suffering.

Nurturing vastness, penetrating the numinous,
True auspices return in repayment.
Accumulating blessings without limit,
Fortune stars descend in bestowal.

Common bonds—profound kindness,
Invested in the womb of parents.
Transforming into a physical body,
Repairing and cultivating ancestral roots.

Austere practice—sincere heart,
Embracing past and present.
Guiding the lost, pointing out delusion,
A hundred spirits add protection.

Internally refining true emptiness,
Universally bestowing sweet dew.
Mingling with the world’s fleeting years,
Luminously abiding.

Myriad changes establish the foundation,
All without contrivance.
Hell and heaven,
Follow human aspiration.

Liberated from bonds and fetters,
Vowing never to look back.
Sun and moon’s flowing light,
Each encounter—true meeting.

Nurturing fire, investing in the mysterious,
Auspicious light spreads forth.
Piercing into the clear sky,
Unfolding the cloud path.

The Dharma realm revolves,
Myriad spirits gather.
Leaping out of the wheel of rebirth,
Filling the void with song and dance.

Resplendent—primordial emptiness,
My gate and door.
Jade register records the name,
A single hearing—thousandfold awakening.

Ascending to reach all heavens,
Descending to open the nether realms.
Dharma and Dao connect to truth,
Heaven above and earth below.

Golden liquid returning elixir,
Washing the heart—firm and steadfast.
Aspiring to learn immortality,
Do not harbor subject or object.

Naturally encountering a true master,
Rely solely on nurturing simplicity.
Bright moon—knowing confidant,
Clear wind—companion.

Radiantly illuminating without bound,
Joyfully encountering the true lord.
Four Greats and Five Constants,
Returning the light—repairing and supplementing.

Lucid and non-active,
All attend the Origin.
*Cloud Radiance Collection, Scroll Three—Concluded*

*Cloud Radiance Collection, Scroll Four*
*Composed by Wang Chuyi of Yuyang, the Jade Sun*

**[Lyrics] "Spring in Qin Garden"**

From seven years of age, I encountered the Lord of Eastern Florescence in the void, who awakened me from dullness. In the *wuchen* year of the Dading era, I again met Master Chongyang, and so composed this lyric to record the truth:

Innately endowed with the immortal embryo,
At seven, my hidden radiance merged with the great yang.
Moved by the true traces of Eastern Florescence,
Drifting through the void to bestow his regard,
I awoke to the dream of the human world—
Then once more met Chongyang.
Secretly I knocked at the Mysterious Pass,
As he subtly expounded profound discourse,
Refining the single yang with bright moon and clear wind.
The divine elixir congealed,
Continuing the pivot of the celestial sphere,
Ascending in transformation to the pure yang.

Joyfully I danced and bowed to Pure Yang,
With the wondrously empty Heavenly Master and True Yang.
Commanded by Sea Toad to guide and advance Star Yang,
With Yuanmiao, the ancient Ren An,
And Yin Xi, the Pass Keeper of Danyang.
The Great Dao spread horizontally,
Driving clouds across the world,
Utterly sweeping away karmic demons to reveal Jade Sun.
All immortals gathered,
Expounding the heavenly principle of non-birth,
The true yang beyond the void.

---

**Twenty-One "Court-Filling Fragrance" Lyrics**
*Composed at Cloud Radiance Grotto on Iron Fork Mountain*

Bending to gaze at the azure sea,
Screening mountains layer upon layer,
Myriad pines and cypresses stand solemn.
Golden waves surge,
Clouds shroud the emerald peaks.
By day, I face the vast and limpid light;
At night’s end, the moon’s fresh imprint appears.
In perfect clarity it gathers,
Crimson radiance enfolding,
The immortal emerging from the grotto.

The original true countenance,
Now utterly realized,
I recline high in the cloud pavilion.
For the elixir furnace is without leakage,
Nurturing the three thousand.
The sagely ancestor bestows descending radiance,
All heavens lift the infant to attend the Origin.
When merit is complete,
Golden script and purple edicts
Will ever stand before the Jade Emperor.

---

*For Elder Brother Da Lang*

A single spark of numinous light,
Manifesting from the void,
Treading the heights of peace amidst mist and rosy clouds.
Clear wind and bright moon
Flow into the cinnabar of Jade Capital.
The five qi and three primals knit their excellence,
Ascending where cloud chariots intertwine.
At the Penglai assembly,
Auspicious light drifts ethereally,
Filling the seats with scattered incense and flowers.

How splendid!
The true wondrous work:
A single grain of immortal elixir,
Brilliantly illuminating Eastern Florescence.
Filling the vast emptiness,
The pure realm knows no bounds.
Recognizing the original, primal nature,
Through cultivation,
The pure and tranquil root-sprout.
When perfection is achieved,
Within the moon’s shadow,
Steadily ascend to the Great Luo’s abode.

---

*For Liu Chaozhen of the Capital*

The four greats’ demeanor,
The three fields’ numinous excellence,
Refined into ninefold-transmuted cinnabar.
Empty and free,
I make the Dao my livelihood.
The Pure Land’s auspicious light and propitious hues,
Exquisite and penetrating,
Mist and rosy clouds beyond the heavens.
In harmony,
Sun flies and moon runs,
Together moving the purple river chariot.

True immortals open wondrous realms,
Bodhi and Buddha-fruit,
A single principle without distinction.
Pointing to the Jade Clarity’s realm,
How distant is this moment?
Awaiting the golden script and purple edicts,
Worldly affairs
Originally held no entanglements.
When the time comes to return,
Celebrating the celestial assembly on high,
To whom shall I boast of the scenery?

---

**Two Lyrics for Lu Xuanwu**

Within the sun, the golden rooster;
Within the moon, the jade hare,
Transforming and circulating the celestial signs’ wax and wane.
Formless, it revolves,
The three realms manifesting compassion.
Nurturing all heavens and earth,
Supporting the three teachings,
The world returns to reliance.
Truly enlightened,
Observing heaven’s Dao,
Pure and non-active.

All Daoists of the ten directions,
Turning their heads in sudden awakening,
Sweep their sleeves and return to the clouds.
Nurturing the immortal embryo’s numinous bones,
Forging and extinguishing the yin corpse.
Certainly, the countenance is renewed and the form transformed,
Penetrating the profound mysteries,
Maintaining essence beyond the material.
When the elixir is complete,
The root-source utterly realized,
All become masters who ferry others.

---

Again:

The heart burns true incense,
The spirit arrays wondrous offerings,
Filling the void to transmit the elixir formula.
Gathering and treasuring the numinous treasures,
Auspicious omens naturally appear.
A single point pierces through kalpas,
Within the two modes,
Yin and yang reverse and return.
The joy of the perfected truth,
The full moon of nature,
Its light scattering fragrant radiance throughout the void.

Searching and examining the profound mysteries,
The root-source without leakage,
Moral power fragrant.
Gathering the spirit-sand and jade liquid,
No risk of collapse or loss.
The fruition of the true immortal’s wondrous Dao,
Transcending the three realms,
Utterly cool and boundless.
The whole family awakens,
Nurturing the spirit and fostering vastness,
All attain the Penglai estate.

---

*For Prefect Liu Xianwu of Laiyang County*

Transmitted through the ages,
Changyang’s sacred land,
Well-suited for cultivating the six perfections and three altars.
Still the heart and sever thoughts,
Nurturing the purple-gold elixir.
The Jade Grotto gathers and returns the myriad transformations,
Upon Kunlun’s ridge,
Wind and moon glisten.
Cloud radiance gathers,
The three fields knit their excellence,
Reversing age to change the youthful countenance.

The Mysterious Pass firmly sealed,
Golden infant and jade maiden,
Immortal edicts pursue and ascend.
Hanging the six heavens’ *ruyi*,
Again gathering orchids.
Vast and distant, soaring high in the long sky,
Drifting and gathering,
Immortals arrayed in ranks.
Do you know?
With deep karmic affinity and broad practice,
Attaining the Dao is fundamentally not difficult.

---

**[Cinnabar Hill]**

At Cinnabar Furnace Hill north of Wangyuan Village in Fushan County, Daoist friends gathered to converse. Discussing how this hill was once Master Fangping’s place of cultivation, suddenly from the void came a response, and so I composed this:

Cinnabar Furnace forms the ridge,
Clear waters coil and wind,
Once the estate of Wang Yuan’s family.
Eight mountains rise in emerald,
Four waters gather the worthy.
Five-colored auspicious clouds cover,
From the three heavens,
Immortal melodies ring clear.
The golden youth reports,
From the nine skies transmitting,
My radiance embraces all without exception.

From the void’s beginning, the question arises:
True suchness responds with goodness,
The great Dharma’s empty king.
Expounding suffering, emptiness, and prajñā,
Left and right, round and square.
Establishing teachings, dividing vehicles to guide and ferry,
Penetrating the ten stages,
All sages’ practices and retreats.
Within the void,
The great Dao of non-being and non-non-being,
Through kalpas, eternally boundless.

---

*For Those Who Have Left the Household*

The essence of rice and wheat,
Harmonious and tranquil,
Naturally completing the spirit through transformation.
The wondrous Dao of non-birth,
Gradually transforming good causes.
Having attained longevity and enduring vision,
Illuminating inversions,
Moon as companion, wind as neighbor.
The former master’s teachings:
Nurturing the true and realizing nature,
Enriching the nation and pacifying the people.

Pure and fresh,
Soaring and radiant,
Heavenly might sweeps away,
Beheading and extinguishing demonic vapors.
Spreading great compassion’s sweet dew,
Widely covering humanity.
Returning to the former chaos before birth,
Again encountering
Withered and decayed meeting spring.

When one truly knows the Dao,
The Three Fields brim with treasures,
And the singular nature avoids sinking into perdition.

*By Imperial Edict Composed*

Thrice summoned to the capital,
Residing at Tianchang Abbey,
Again by edict to rebuild the new Daoist cloister—
Decreed to attend Tianchang,
Ordered to restore its halls and chambers,
The Dao spreads wide, all returning to truth.

Our master’s profound transformation,
Tan and Ma both receive grace.
Seven golden lotuses manifest wonders,
The court rejoices, favor renewed.
Once more the imperial summons arrives,
Chariots drawn by four horses,
Offering thanks to the sagely and enlightened sovereign.

All is accomplished.

In every Dharma assembly,
Princes, ministers, and officials,
Loyal subjects within and beyond the court.
Encountering the true joy of Great Peace,
The vast causes of virtue and Dao.
Further hoping that fellow seekers of the mystery
Will uphold the Three Teachings,
Rejoicing together through the ages.
Together we dedicate,
Wishing our emperor ten thousand years,
Eternally enthroned in the vermilion palace.

*In Praise of Lord Danyang*

Long serving in Dongmou,
Of noble and illustrious lineage,
Naturally possessing a distinct destiny.
Receiving Lü’s true legacy,
A single gesture meeting Chongyang.
Sweeping his sleeves, he followed the transformations in western Qin,
Perfecting true attainment,
Returning to his homeland.
Advancing toward the origin,
His countenance renewed, his form transformed,
Everywhere manifesting auspicious signs.

In Changyang,
Leaving wondrous traces,
Teaching spread across the heavens,
Exhorting the burning of heart-incense.
Attaining the awakening of the numinous source,
Abiding alone in cool clarity.
The precious cauldron completes nine revolutions of the elixir,
Illuminating inversions,
Reflecting and returning the light.
Together attaining the Dao,
Extolling his abundant virtue,
Presenting *Man Ting Fang*.

*Seeking Rain*

For the long drought in Huang County,
A Yellow Register Retreat was held,
And abundant rain fell—
Two poems composed.

Briefly parting from Dongmou,
Journeying west to Deng Prefecture,
Countless spirits arrayed afar in Jinxiang.
Boundless immortal retinues,
All manifesting auspices beyond the void.
Do not say Penglai’s path is distant—
All the perfected,
Gather in Zhiyang.
Beneath the stars,
In the cool, still night,
Clouds feast in homage to the August Sovereign of the Void.

The ten directions join the Dharma assembly,
Sincere devotion before the sages,
Presenting incense to absolve transgressions.
Delivering the nine dark realms from suffering,
All behold the Three Lights.
Those present all receive blessings and protection,
Bathed in sweet dew,
Together spared from calamity.
In carefree joy,
The circular altar disperses,
All singing *Man Ting Fang*.

Again—
Dragons turn in the western river,
Golden light swaying and shimmering,
Leaping bodies soaring into the vault of heaven.
Summoning clouds, spouting mist,
Mighty power fully displayed.
Withered crops suddenly meet abundant rain,
All hearts overflow with joy.
What can compare?
As if gathering auspicious treasures,
Just like arriving in the immortal realm.

True yang,
Resplendent and radiant,
Beyond the formless,
Emerging with luminous countenance.
Abiding in the primordial chaos of the Three Realms,
For kalpas without end.
Deeply indebted to the Three Pure Ones for descending blessings,
For the southeast,
Fragrant incense wafts across the cloudy seas.
Say not it is broken—
Great Peace follows in joy,
Through the Dao attesting to the eternal constant.

*For Fan Mingshu*

A single step flowing west,
Piercing through the Ox and Dipper,
In the clear wind and bright moon, his countenance shines.
The sky filled with sages,
Guiding me well.
Bestowing phoenix carriages and simurgh chariots,
Offering golden tripods,
Fragrant elixirs and incense.
The Milky Way turns,
Star altars and moon palaces,
Truly a scene beyond compare.

In old age, ascending to the cloudy Han,
Shedding the skin-bag,
Parting from his homeland.
Returning to the jade capital and golden towers,
The immortal path stretches far.
Securely donning celestial robes,
A numinous breeze scatters,
Jade pendants chiming.
At the assembly of the origin,
The ten directions and Three Realms,
All sing *Man Ting Fang*.

*Instructions to Disciples Sent to Wendeng to Hold a Almsgiving*

Brothers Peng, Li, and Liu,
Three of one mind,
In harmony with all the county’s acquaintances.
Calm your hearts, devote your efforts,
Assisting one another, each steadfast.
Today, off to Wenshan,
Holding an almsgiving,
Regardless of high or low.
In the bitter cold of winter,
Facing the wind and braving the snow,
Recognize this—do not shirk the labor.

Carrying firewood and hauling water,
Aiding in due time,
Not a grain of rice to be wasted.
Upholding the high intent of the hall,
Embracing both honor and disgrace.
Extinguishing fire requires the patience of Dharma,
Dispelling yin ghosts,
Relies entirely on the sword of Chan.
True yang stirs,
Refining gold and jade,
Forever joining the ranks of immortals.

*After the Yellow Register Retreat at the Temple of Various Kings in Ganyu County, Presented to the Assembly*

In the coastal prefecture, spreading karmic conditions,
Ganyu expounding the transformations,
Favorable causes again manifesting to the various kings.
Diligently performing the Yellow Register Retreat,
Specially summoning auspicious signs.
For ten thousand miles, clouds gather and mists disperse,
Gentle winds cease,
Lamps and candles glow brightly.
Atop the star altar,
Steps of the void resound,
Beneath the moon, truly melodious.

Again and again bowing and kneeling,
Devout reverence piercing through,
The assembled sages hear the incense.
Descending boundless grace,
Universally saving the living and the dead.
From this, all attain bliss,
Leaving the shadowy realms,
Ascending to heaven.
Opening the cloud feast,
Preserving life and extending longevity,
All sing *Man Ting Fang*.

*Requesting Paper for Transcribing Sutras for Lonely Spirits*

Faint and distant, forsaken souls,
In the dark, endless night,
Deeply sunk, unable to discern the years.
Utterly without knowledge,
Where to inquire of kin?
Ever since drifting and scattering in the vast expanse,
Empty sorrow and suffering,
How may they ascend?
Together we extend salvation,
Going door to door, bowing and entreating,
Begging for paper to transcribe sutras again.

Noble lords, may you reflect,
Vast in compassion and vows,
Increasing blessings and benefits for all.
Moved by the myriad sages of the Three Heavens,
All responding to this humble sincerity.
The fiery haze transforms into lotus ponds,
Graceful light shines,
Dry bones revive.
All encounter deliverance,
Eternally freed from transgressions,
All awakening to perfect clarity.

*Expressing My Feelings*

Tossed in the bitter sea,
Toiling at Ke Mountain,
Seeking auspicious jade and treasures.
Circling again and again,
Suddenly awakening to the eternal constant.
The two converge at the mysterious pass, conveying passage,
Ascending the numinous radiance,
Soaring beyond Fusang.
Returning the light,
The celestial pivot and myriad images,
Each appearing in the Hall of Light.

When one thoroughly fathoms this principle,
Worldly dust is all cast aside,
The dream of the world entirely forgotten.
Awakening, body and mind harmonious and at ease,
Boundless cool clarity.
The myriad transformations gathered within the cauldron,
Crimson light advances,
The elixir ripens, fragrant.
Having swallowed it,
Rejuvenating the old, returning to youth,
All from *Man Ting Fang*.

*After the Yellow Register Retreat, Ascending the Rosy Clouds, Recalling My Master*

Of the lineage of Pure Yang,
Manifesting wonders in due time,
Secretly transmitting the immortal lineage to my master.
Chongyang, in his compassionate transformation,
Left teachings to Ma of Fufeng.
Revolving the mysterious mechanism, following its course,
Perfecting true attainment,
The Three Realms harmoniously merged.

Radiant light descends,
The departed souls are delivered,
All within the azure heavens.
If you, sirs, awaken to this truth,
Suddenly cast aside the sea of mundane dust,
Embodying the Dao as one.
Gather the mysterious pearl, the elixir treasure,
Returning old to youth.
Surely this is transcending the mortal to enter sagehood,
Soaring beyond the clouds,
Light filling Shandong.
Truly without falsehood,
Mercury refined through nine cycles,
Straight to the Palace of Great Purity.

*Presented to a Renunciant*
Weary of nobility, forsaking glory,
Embracing poverty, yearning for the Dao,
Humble and gentle in conduct.
Through inner refinement, attaining communion with the true,
Each step transforms into cool clarity.
A single spark of numinous emptiness brings sudden enlightenment,
Manifesting clearly,
Auspicious omens of a thousand ages.
By this karmic connection,
Yuyang from this point,
Together shall behold Chongyang.

*Heart Incense*
Permeating inner and outer,
Pervading all with fragrant mist,
Through the Three Realms and the ten directions.
The immortals of Great Purity,
Stoop to bestow their gracious light.
All are saved—nine generations and seven ancestors,
Leaving the dark night,
Ascending to the immortal realm.
At the Heavenly Prime Assembly,
Myriad spirits rejoice,
All singing *Man Ting Fang*.

*Presented to the Recluse of Guangling Town*
Sacred formulas and immortal methods,
Mysterious mechanisms and wondrous principles,
Transmitted orally, word by word.
Fortunate to receive the master’s instruction,
Revealing what preceded birth.
Silently revolving the celestial cycle,
Witnessing the Pole Star,
Myriad phenomena in flux.
Creating transformation,
True dragon and true tiger,
True mercury and true lead.
At the meeting place of the Yellow Court,
The Five Phases inverted,
The Eight Trigrams interwoven.
Relying on the jade furnace and golden crucible,
Fanned by mighty fire.
When the nine cycles of effort are complete,
The elixir is formed,
Yin exhausted, yang perfected.

Neither distant nor near,
Neither lacking nor whole.

*Resplendent Divine Light* (*Sheng Sheng Man*)
Jade concealed in stone,
Pearls hidden in clams,
All depend on the craftsman’s skill.
The true light within the outer shell manifests,
Just as in the primordial beginning.
To illuminate the mind and recognize nature,
Shatter every illusion,
Breaking through to emptiness.
In purity,
Behold the sky like a jade table,
The autumn night’s solitary moon.
Thus the ten directions shine clearly,
Grasping the pivot of yin and yang,
No dust or defilement can restrain.
From ancient times, those who attained,
Entered the wondrous beyond all residue.
Though branches and leaves may be myriad,
With Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism,
All dwell in unity.
Ever returning to the One,
Perfectly realizing the absolute,
Attaining the immortal capital.

*Four Songs of Blooming Flowers Along the Path*
All Daoists under heaven,
Truly recognize authentic cultivation.
The nine gates bear no leakage,
Myriad spirits remain.
Golden lead and jade mercury,
Water and fire naturally replenish and withdraw.
The three fields churn with cloudy waves,
Bearing the golden elixir,
The jade person steadily pilots the divine boat.
Heaven and earth purified,
Sun and moon in confluence.
Meritorious deeds fully perfected,
A single numinous true nature abides,
Freely roaming.
The celestial host in full,
Welcoming, guiding by the cloud’s edge.
Vastly transcending the dharma realms,
Manifesting in the human world,
Names recorded in the Jade Register of Great Purity.

*Presented to the Virtuous Assembly of Three Prefectures and Five Gatherings*
Wenshan cradles seven treasures,
Ninghai surges with golden lotuses.
The Three Lights shine together,
The Jade Flower Heaven.
Able to uphold equanimity,
Bearing good karmic fruit.
The five directions refined and elegant,
Harmonious qi brimming,
Transforming into auspicious mists and propitious vapors.
Spouting immortal blossoms,
Fresh through all four seasons.
Radiance beams toward the cloud pavilion.
Gathering the essence of heaven and earth,
Ascending to court at the Origin.
Golden infant and jade maiden,
Silently transmitting inner words.
Myriad spirits all stand listening,
Assembled at Dragon Auspiciousness,
The immortals of the Great Jin’s eastern land.

*Sent to Master Chaoyuan*
Deeply grateful for frequent summons,
Startled and hastening.
The karmic ties of the three prefectures not yet exhausted,
Unable to depart.
Presiding over retreats in various places,
Humbly entrusted with delivering the deluded masses.
Suddenly receiving your fine letter,
Soon to meet in person,
Once more discussing the subtle mysteries.
Well praised,
The root of the Great Dao.
Dispelling the doubts of many hearts.
At the crucial juncture ahead,
Diligently refine and uphold.

The dusty passions of ten thousand kalpas.
Another fine future lies ahead.
Here, beyond aging and death,
Attaining longevity.
Immortal bearing and Daoist bones,
Naturally sensing the utmost purity.
Myriad streams of the Silver River turn,
Stirring the celestial gate,
The true nature of Great Purity perfectly illuminated.

*Magnolia Flower Curtain*
After the Yellow Register Retreat at the Three Halls Temple in Wang Village, Ganyu County
Freely roaming, carefree and expansive,
A tiny golden mountain for one’s humble abode.
Applying wondrous power to empower,
Conducting the grand retreat,
True sages descending to the altar.
Graceful light universally bestowed upon the lower realms,
Saving the living and the dead,
Delivering them from suffering to join the immortal ranks.
Luminously pervading the composed dharma body,
Dwelling in serene tranquility.
Returning, guiding and expounding the profound,
Deleting all inner and outer affairs.
Gathering the fivefold cool clarity,
Heaven pacified, earth stilled,
Piercing through the three barriers.
August Heaven aids the vast Great Dao,
Delivering all beings,
No species finds it difficult.
Soon, under the golden script’s decree,
Forever parting from the dusty sea of the mundane world.

*A Branch of Flowers* (Elixir Formula)
Universally exhorting fellow practitioners,
Wondrous medicine possessed by all.
The former master personally imparted,
For your cultivation.
A single taste of true heart,
Strike the bonds, let them not flee.
Gentleness as the guide,
Humbly ingest it,
Regardless of before or after meals.

**Great Prohibitions:** Avoid qi, wealth, lust, and wine.
Speak sparingly in bustling places.
Sever emotional ties and love, cast off sorrow.
Follow the formula in cultivation—no harm to sleeves or heart.
Diligently ingest it for three to five years,
And you shall reverse aging, return to youth,
Guaranteed immortality, undying.

*Soft-Turned Shoes*
*Thanks for Aid and Affinity*

Devout believers, set your hearts at ease,
Do not indulge in wild conjecture.
Repeatedly honored with feasts of generosity,
Yet I offer nothing in return—
Only a vow to requite,
When spring deepens, I depart,
To return in summer.
Fasting assemblies well arranged,
Augmenting fortune, dissolving calamity.
From beginning to end, unwavering,
Abide in non-action and purity.
When true merit is full,
Leave the dusty world,
Ascend to Penglai.

*Green Jade Tablet: Sixteen Poems*
*First Proclamation*

By imperial decree, I was invited to reside at Tianchang Abbey,
The sacred words never ceased.
A favored child was bestowed as my companion.
Following the moment’s flow, feasts were granted,
All manner of splendor prepared,
Summoned upward to the clouds and mist.
Jade towers and golden halls filled the void,
Myriad forms interwoven.
A single luminous pearl shone resplendent.
At the Jade Pool’s immortal gathering,
All spirits assembled,
Dwelling forever in the celestial vaults.

*Third Proclamation*

Since encountering the companion of true emptiness,
I alone tempered my stubborn heart.
Heaven manifested like a green jade tablet.
The palace of spirit ignited,
The inner elixir’s light filled,
The nature perfected, truly undisturbed.
By third decree, purple robes were bestowed at Tianchang Abbey,
A shore of pure wind.
Sweeping away demons without reckoning,
The ten directions and three realms
Transformed into purity,
Beyond all celestial constraints.

*At the Celestial Music Feast of the Supreme Clarity Palace*

Heaven permits this poor Daoist,
Wherever the fragrant breeze disperses.
Ten thousand misfortunes and a thousand disasters truly undisturbed.
Calm the heart, practice the teachings,
Universally open the moon of the heart,
Awaken to the returning light.

*Revisiting the Supreme Clarity Palace*

All affairs unbound,
I roam once more beneath its halls.
Looking up, I repay imperial grace, fulfilling my vow.
Leisurely I retrace my steps,
To Mizhou’s Anhua,
Returning to seclude in Yuanju Abbey.

*Thanks to the Master*

The master lifted me from the depths of sinking,
Beyond life and death’s reckoning.
Escaping the wheel of rebirth, transcending the dharma realms.
All heavens convey and transform,
Manifesting formless,
A single point of perfect clarity remains.
In this floating world, ever at peace,
Casually plucking jade mushrooms.
The guardian deities wield mighty power—
Tossing ringing bells, hurling fire,
Sweeping dust for a thousand miles,
Banishing all demonic harms.

*To the Imperial Relative, the Fourth Noble*

Leaving the dust together, we formed a carefree bond,
No longer contending over length or shortness.
From the beginning, the true visage remains.
Augmenting fortune and longevity,
Mysteriously penetrating the profound,
Rank and position ascend anew.
Quietly harmonizing dragon and tiger in constant battle,
The sacred treasure gathers, turning the heart.
The four great luminosities refine as one.
Rising smoke, descending mist,
Lightning flashes, thunder roars—
In an instant, the divine youth appears.

*To Fellow Daoists: Two Poems*

Meeting Yuyang, all doubts dissolved,
No longer bound by rising or falling.
I ask the cloud companions of Qingzhou:
All harbor wondrous use,
Ever upholding fasts and alms,
Step by step, the heart’s incense burns.
The fortune star shines brilliantly beyond the void,
Manifesting truly undisturbed.
Jade disks and jasper flowers connect to inner vision.
The golden elixir congeals,
The purple script arrives with decree—
Soon, ascending to the cloudy Han.

*Again*

Following conditions, adapting with skillful means,
Daring not grow weary in the slightest.
Only hoping the heroic and noble all turn toward goodness.
Revering the inner teachings,
Externally practicing vast conduct,
Each tempering their stubborn hearts.
Two child attendants cling in mutual affection,
Karmic retribution manifesting at every turn.
Households prosper, feasts abound.
Together, we ascend to fortune and longevity,
Forever dispelling calamities and obstacles,
Never neglecting the vow of true cultivation.

Behold the register of merits—
Know that the world’s span is brief,
Time to plant blessings and raise immortal halls.
Through endless kalpas, the ledger of virtue endures,
Adding names to the scroll of longevity,
Amending past transgressions,
Freed from the underworld’s grasp.
Auspicious clouds coil in unbroken grace,
Calling forth radiant friends and cloud companions.
Together we savor the immortal blossoms’ fragrant splendor,
Sipping flowing rosy nectar,
Drunk—where to return?
Resting in the feast of Penglai’s pavilion.

*Bestowed upon the virtuous assembly of Fushan County’s Benevolent Longevity Preservation*

Fushan’s Benevolent Longevity is worthy of admiration,
Each practicing skillful means.
Moved, Heaven’s Lord bestows care,
Dispensing kindness, spreading virtue,
Erasing faults, dissolving transgressions,
Fortune and emolument turning with the years.
Discerning truth, casting off falsehood—unwavering heart,
Gradually mastering cultivation.
All attain the art of grasping clouds with their own hands,
The departed and the gone—
All delivered,
Fulfilling life’s vows.

*Requested by Li Wuzhen*

The capital’s seven treasures—true suchness body,
Never to be cast aside.
The jade treasury ever gathers rootless water,
Refined by pure yang,
Condensing into pearly dewdrops,
Transforming into true auspiciousness.
Three wondrous substances play in midair,
Snow-warmed golden flowers resplendent.
Only when the formless divine countenance appears
Do phoenix carriages and simurgh-drawn chariots ascend,
Rising to the cloudy Han,
Claiming the serene and cool abode.

**In Response to the Imperial Kinsman’s Summons**

Three winters’ biting cold, crimson clouds spread,
Six-petaled flakes drift like floating down.
Earth chilled, heaven frozen—hard to advance.
The path thick with ice and snow,
Calling back the young and simple,
I dwell for now in my thatched hut.

The grand jiao in Guizhou brooks no refusal,
Its merit must gather and complete.
The newly departed, the long-gone—all delivered,
Empowered by the wondrous Dao,
Unfurling the cloud-feast,
Together ascending to the Primordial.

**Admonishing the World to Turn Their Hearts**

Good sons, good daughters—qi of the heart,
In life and death, none can replace another.
Relentless, impermanence arrives first for you.
The skin-sack rots, foul,
Bones scatter apart,
Only to draw tears from grieving kin.

Awakened, let not the mind-monkey play,
The sword of wisdom sharpened keen.
The Six Thieves and Three Corpses all flee,
Amidst the blazing purple flame,
A full measure of cinnabar treasure,
Offered up to the Three Pure Ones.

**Two Poems from Danxia Abbey in Wendeng**

Townsfolk and officials together raise the abbey,
Their resolve unwavering.
The construction of Danxia’s merit runs deep.
Cultivating truth, nurturing vastness,
Cutting off greed and attachment,
A single point shines bright and clear.

The Primordial’s three realms glow resplendent,
Lucidly ascending the cloudy Han.
The living and the dead all reach the shore,
Expounding the true Dao,
Forever transcending without hindrance,
As a divine youth calls out.

**Again**

The merit of preserving the body must be perfected,
Recognize the original face of the primal beginning.
Early, settle the affairs of the future path.
The Three Fields in motion,
The Two Modes in harmony,
Above and below, radiance flows through.

Kindred spirits, by recommendation, summon one another,
This principle is truly profound.
All become true kin of the Heavenly Primordial’s law.
Spirits soar beyond the clouds,
Names and surnames remain,
Recorded at Danxia Abbey.

**For the Virtuous Assembly of Ganyu**

Divine light arrays the ranks of true immortals,
Virtue and power must not be lightly cast aside.
Silently nurture the Mystery Pearl, flawless.
Fivefold radiance,
A single wheel of perfect form—
Seeing it, one feels shame.

Two jade paths divide heaven and earth,
Within, auspicious signs appear.
Leaping into the cloudy empyrean to audience the Jade Emperor,
Forever free from birth and death,
Only now is the truth grasped,
In the gāthā of the Prajñā Sūtra.

**A Single Cry to Rein In the Horse**

Amidst all, only you permit word to pass,
Who else could fathom this?
There is one—spirit keen, wit sharp.
Gathering stars, pacing the Dipper,
Secret talismans inverted,
Golden script reports:
The ascending and descending path of audience with the Primordial.

The immortal kin of the Azure Void receive a new title,
Only now is perfect clarity rejoiced.
Before the Hall of the Bright Moon, the celestial wind sweeps.
Through the cloudless sky they come and go,
I follow the Mystery Teachings.
The immortals never age,
Surpassing Penglai Isle.

**Three *Jiangshenzi* Poems: Expressing My Feelings**

**The Azure Sky as Quilt, Earth as Mat**

Azure sky for quilt, earth for mat,
Covering the numinous source, illumining the heart’s field.
Jade mercury, golden lead—
twin channels spouting flowing springs.
This is the Dao-sprout spanning the azure vast,
frequently watered, ever renewed.

Cloud companions, rosy friends—secretly they transmit.
Intent unbroken, moving the immortal embryo.
The mysterious pass silently dissolves,
light piercing the ninefold heavens.
The elixir complete, all spirits join in celebration,
true numinous nature restored to the Primordial.

**Advancing the Dao**

Divine radiance surges, surging through the vault of heaven.
Offering to the numinous yang, awakening to true constancy.
The three chariots of般 are set in motion,
all converging in the Hall of Brightness.
Striking past the Gate of Heaven, returning to the Purple Palace,
free from decay, spared from peril.

**Entrusting the Body to the Floating World**

Entrusting the body to the floating world, feigning madness,
nature fragrant, bones firm and unyielding.
Perfect clarity attained,
no need for hidden veils.
Soaring through the eight directions without hindrance,
following the myriad things, manifesting round and square.

**Returning to the True**

The true source of original nature—still and silent.
Freely drifting, wholly at ease.
This is the void itself,
beyond heaven, the numinous sprout appears.
Alone in blissful leisure, no self or other,
calling the bright moon, inhaling the pure breeze.

**Upon the Azure Lotus Pond**

Upon the azure lotus pond, auspicious light sways.
Ascending the layered empyrean,
jade name inscribed.
The sword of wisdom brandished in the void,
dispelling demons, slaying hordes of fiends.
Unfolding the ancient and eternal Dao of purity,
vastly universal, the Dharma-wheel bridge.

**Five *Moshanxi* Poems: Instructions to Disciples**

To depart the sea of suffering,
one must clearly cultivate refinement.
Gradually extinguishing worldly passions,
silently the divine work turns the wheel.
From the void, creation—
the cinnabar crucible, purple mushrooms fragrant,
golden blossoms knit, jade springs flow,
the entire body suffused with divine radiance.

A thousand calamities unstained,
ten thousand illnesses all dispelled.
The seven apertures wholly harmonized,
the eight vessels opened for inner ascent.
Nine palaces, ten grounds—
the six thieves vanish without trace.
The three luminaries shine,
the two lads transmit,
the one nature unchanging.

**To Disciples in the Capital**

In the capital, our fellowship,
pursuing the Dao—do not falter.
Let no conduct stray from the path,
ever embodying the three luminaries without obscurity.
Heaven’s mystery, earth’s subtlety—
true wisdom gathers numinous clarity.
Intimate friends,
discoursing on longevity,
this principle has no equal.

Supreme peace and bliss,
eternally unbroken since ancient times.
A single pearl of transformative life,
twin paths of radiant light paired.
The dharma-realm of humans and gods,
wherever the heart’s incense is kindled.
Transcending creation,
surpassing the realm of suffering,
steadily attending the Jade Pool assembly.

**To Two Elders Afflicted by Illness Seeking Teachings**

Green mountains, emerald waters—
alone I make my way for life’s sustenance.

**All ailments wholly dispelled,**
**the single nature perfectly luminous, unhidden.**
**Elixir perfected, fruits fulfilled—**
**gathered at the Jade Void Altar.**
**Beholding self-mastery, joyous and carefree,**
**a realm apart: the immortals’ station.**

**Sir, awaken swiftly,**
**cast aside all worldly affairs.**
**Count your future path with care,**
**hasten to transcend this turbid world.**
**Forming immortal bonds,**
**accumulating profound merit,**
**comprehending the wondrous principle,**
**escaping the cage of the mundane,**
**everlasting, never to decline.**

**the deep crucible’s jade spring flows,**
**purple flames erupt, golden elixir rolls—**
**inner and outer radiance blazes forth.**

**Delighting in true joy, idly humming in the azure grotto—**
**verdant auspicious mist flashes forth.**

**Suffering ended, sweetness comes—heaven’s bestowed bounty.**
**Sun and moon exchange offices, the true reversal.**
**Beyond emptiness, another fine lineage emerges;**
**the rabbit enters the womb’s abode, dredged anew.**

**transforming and penetrating the Great Void, fully realized.**
**This numinous clarity, embracing all phenomena—**
**liberated from the shame of birth and death.**

**Having encountered the Complete Perfection in this life,**
**the return is naturally guided by the immortals.**

**To Wang Zhiming of Wendeng**

Each one cultivates the true,
everyone practices the Dao.
The subtle mechanism and wondrous principle must be sought.
Hour by hour, ever kindling the precious censer’s incense,
day by day, always sweeping the field of the heart-mind.
Step by step, cool and serene,
divine radiance overshadows.
Sages of the ten directions bestow grace in return.
Amid piled purple clouds, the jade countenance shines—
the realm of everlasting spring knows no decay.

**For Yan Yiweng of Dengzhou**

Qi harmonious and balanced,
light and brightness gathered.
For three days, above and below, jade-white essence flows.
In leisure, now and again, the elixir is sipped—
golden lead and jade mercury suddenly congeal.
The maiden and the youth,
cloud companions and rosy friends,
step through emptiness, beyond birth and extinction.
The teaching spreads through the four seas, honoring the Complete Perfection—
when merit is complete, a master comes to deliver.

**To Han Yiweng of Dengzhou**

Penglai at hand’s reach,
the three mountains in mutual resonance.
Golden waves and jade billows roar and surge.
Emerald light sways, touching the vault of heaven,
pure wind and bright moon envelop the stars.
Myriad streams of silver toads,
round luminosity converges.
Exquisite, the seven treasures form the true auspicious Dipper.
If one practices cultivation like this,
the great Dao of Primordial Origin is all accomplished.

**Ode to the Stone Ganoderma of Tiecha Mountain**

Cloud-cream of the four seas,
spiritual elegance of the three mountains.
To gather the ganoderma, one must befriend the formless.
It sates hunger and quenches thirst, nourishing the jade sprout,
augmenting spirit and extending destiny, luminous and penetrating.
Phoenixes soar,
tigers and dragons contend.
Golden lions and jade elephants roar and bellow.
Once carried to offer the perfected sages,
if one consumes it, there is no aging or decay.

**To the Daoist**

**On the Virtues of the Daoist**

Brick and tile in lofty conduct,
the alchemical furnace refines the wondrous nature.
Zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting adorn the imperial carriage.
Chisels, hammers, inked lines, and incense-sewn seams—
all are invited to graft and cultivate the elixir.
Swiftly tread the cloud-borne path,
crossing mountains, streams, and ridges.
Ever ponder the weighty Way of immortals,
gazing beneath the Moon of the Western River toward Penglai,
where in carefree joy the Perfected of the Complete Truth awaken.

**Nine "Xingxiangzi"**

**Meeting the Master**
For eight long years,
I met Chongyang at last.
Moved by true compassion, he shattered the king of my heart.
In clarity he guided, in stillness he weighed.
I saw purple mist arise,
auspicious winds arrive,
clouds gather in the Cavern of Radiance.

Embracing the One without parting,
responding to things in roundness and square,
he summoned Dongmou—
the infant boy who attained the Dao.
The cinnabar ripened, the fruit filled,
he donned the rainbow robes.
Then I beheld the Three Clarities,
paid homage to the Jade Emperor,
and universally offered incense.

**To Little Hu of Binzhou**
There is a true formula—
who dares to undertake it?
Gathering mist and rosy clouds,
fragrant and cool.
The dharma-body is filled,
the spirit-light replenished.
The root-source is settled,
the endurance of the unborn,
returning to blessed auspice.

Primordial qi is consumed as food,
thirst slaked with rosy nectar.
Merging with the mystery-essence,
one abides in the Dao as the constant.
The azure lotus unfolds,
the jade calyx exudes fragrance.
The purple-gold elixir coalesces,
the fruit of purity fills the vault of heaven.

**In Gratitude to the Assembly at the Sacred Water Feast**
Alone I lean by the gate of Peng,
offering incense in my journey.
Praising emptiness and nothingness,
the cool clarity of virtue and Dao.
Piercing gold and stone,
manifesting auspice beyond the void.
Then I drink the medicinal spoon,
augment the elixir crucible,
and refine the true yang.

The vast expanse scatters,
I encounter the immortal formula.
I thank all you lords
for bestowing robes and provisions.
Reopening the Daoist feast,
mending the precious spirit-light,
I enjoy the rosy lifespan,
increase blessings and wisdom,
and distance sorrow.

**To Little Liu of Laizhou**
Without form or lustrous light,
do not let it drift away.
Scatter the mystery-pearls,
the precious kernels of true auspice.
Following emotions, they flow and turn,
settling into emptiness and decay.
The Dao is hard to accomplish,
merit hard to achieve,
karma hard to bear.

With focused sincerity,
grasp yin and yang.
Traverse the numinous palaces,
offer incense in the jeweled halls.
Golden lads pair,
jade maidens form ranks.
The five gates open,
the twin passes penetrate,
emerging from Kunlun’s ridge.

**Exhorting Others to Abandon Evil and Embrace Good**
To evade misfortune and calamity,
let the heart delight and the face glow.
Cast aside all things,
let every affair rest.
Hold fast to pure thoughts,
revere and admire the mysterious wind.
Ever delight in true joy,
seek the true essence,
awaken to true emptiness.

The bright moon fills the breast,
illuminating and dispelling evil traces.
With cloud companions
and rosy companions met,
together we transcend the dharma-realm,
returning to the immortal palace.
We pay homage to the Great Lofty One,
the sages of all heavens,
the Jade Void’s lineage.

**Two Poems in Thanks for the Gift of Incense from the Princess**

**I**
Trembling and reverent,
I kindle the incense of the heart.
I thank you for bestowing
sandalwood marrow and deep incense.
The golden censer’s smoke rises,
perfuming the dharma-realm.
I offer it to the Jade Void Lord,
the Emperors of all heavens—
may its fragrance be universally known.

**II**
I bow in homage to our sovereign,
burning incense in reverence.
Praising the golden branches,
the jade leaves’ fragrant essence.
One person spreads virtue,
ten thousand lands transmit its fragrance.
Revealing the original true self,
the primal nature,
the natural fragrance.

**Another**
A single point of round light,
the wondrous incense of the true cavern.
Freely roaming,
offering incense through the three realms.
The harmonious Dao-body,
the vast and boundless celestial fragrance.
Attaining the great good cause,
the fruit of longevity,
the fragrant nature of the spirit.

The pure immortal incense,
the priceless renowned fragrance.
Encountering the clear dynasty,
near and far revere its scent.
In peace and carefree joy,
flowers and blossoms are especially fragrant.
May great merit be accomplished,
ascending to the origin,
filling the void with fragrance.

**Observing Elder Xu’s Devotion to Goodness**
The bitter sea stretches boundless,
deeply pitiable.
That gust of wind—
a slight awakening to the true constant.
Clothing and cap unkempt,
worldly karma vanishes.
Thus true merit is completed,
forgetting self and other,
without deliberation.

The body enters the round light,
auspicious signs manifest.
Auspicious mist envelops
the seven fragrant lotuses.
The jade pistil reopens,
silver frost re-forms.
Piercing the great void,
without aging or decay,
forever cool and clear.

**To Silent Brother Wang**
True joy is leisurely,
speech’s transgressions erased.
Nurturing harmony,
dispelling foolish obstinacy.
The dharma-nature is perfectly fused,
the youthful countenance restored.
Then one emerges from the three vehicles,
surpasses the ten stages—
no difficulty at all.

Five-colored rings revolve,
smelting the golden elixir.
Behold the immortal furnace,
empty yet coiled with dragons.
Yin and yang’s numbers complete,
the heavenly pass is struck through.
Then one treads the auspicious clouds,
ascends to the origin,
and joins the ranks of immortals.

**Sixteen "Sumuzhe"**

**Admonishing Daoists Against Strife**
Those who leave the household
must be resolute.
Search within yourself,
do not discuss others’ faults.
Let not life and destiny be entangled by dust.
Diligently cultivate,
alone refining the obstinate heart.

Nurture harmony,
the spirit unconfused.
Drop by drop, the numinous cinnabar
is borne to the cloudy Han.
The jade maiden and golden lad display their skill.
Without action or striving,
accompanied by the true emptiness beyond things.

**For Zhao Xinwu of Ninghai**
The Five Illuminations Palace,
the Three Lights shine.
The eight meridians’ infant,
the nine revolutions penetrate the mysterious wonder.
In the Seven Treasures Grove, they ever dance and leap.
The ten stages are exquisitely wrought,
a single true laughter.

Vast and obscure,
obscure and vast.
The immortals of past and present
are forever summoned together.
Outer paths and heavenly demons remain unaware.
Only then is round completion rejoiced,
fully and again fully accomplished.

**Expressing My Feelings**
I am wild and unrestrained,
truly nine hundred strong.
Unfettered through heaven and earth,
the crisp qi still feels confined.
The great Dao flows unimpeded, without barrier.
Earth is still, heaven clear—
each step lightly and swiftly taken.

Evening clouds gather,
the autumn moon is white.
Myriad images interweave,
brilliant and flowing with pure hue.
Do not say Dongmou lacks feathered guests.
The wondrous workings of the mystery,
truly and surely attain the constant.

**At the Shrine of Master Danyang**

**Yanming Jiang and Zhong Zizheng**

Yanming Jiang and Zhong Zizheng,
Master Wenju among the three friends,
each poured forth their cinnabar sincerity to attain the upright.
Aiding in the unfolding of the Mystery Gate,
they transformed and flourished the realm of Changyang.

Jade Yang Wang took the lead,
guiding the sleeves of others.
External temptations swayed the many lords,
yet they bore fruit in the Quanzhen practice.
Craftsmen and fellow practitioners must show utmost reverence.
Moved by the winds of Fufeng,
they aspired solely toward Penglai.

The Dharma names of Jiang and Zhong:
Zhong Shouzhong, Jiang Shoujing.
They guided Danyang’s transmission,
delivering and liberating all spiritual natures.
With earnest devotion and steadfast hearts, all held them in respect.
Far and near, their virtue spread,
and all revered them as true sages.

Yet now, who still listens?
The craftsmen face hardship,
recklessly wielding their sharp edges.
How much fine timber is cast aside!
First, they demand payment,
daring not defy their commands.

**Xu Gong’s Inquiry on the Fruits of Adversity**

Guard the sprouting bud, nurture the auspicious fruit.
The seven-jeweled golden lotus
shall bear the fruit of long life.
Through non-action and non-striving, the Dao’s fruit is attained.
Emerging from the mundane cage,
one decisively verifies the fruit of true immortality.

To cultivate in old age is difficult,
for true essence leaks away,
ruining the fruit of the Jetavana.
Clapping hands in vain, one returns without cause or effect.
Like the relentless march of impermanence,
hasten to refine the fruit of Quanzhen.

**Sending Master Danyang’s Dharma Body to the Western Pass**

Alas, the wayward husband strays from the true Dao,
deftly wielding schemes,
slandering with cunning and deceit.
The sect’s traditions are ruined, with nowhere to appeal.
Like a shattered mirror or a kite’s broken wings,
how can I make this clear?

Now, who dares to vouch?
Poison concealed within,
they bring disgrace upon the Quanzhen teachings.
From the Eastern Sea to Western Qin, all are afflicted.
Cao, Jia, and Lai—
heavenly retribution must come.

**Admonition to Li, Liang, and Zhang**

Li, Zhang, and Liang, heed my brief words.
Do not hesitate or waver,
lest your hearts be overturned.
Ever resentful that Jade Yang offers no reply,
with such cultivation,
when shall you return to Penglai Isle?

The monk of Great Tang, old Jiudu,
endured ten thousand hardships,
yet with single-minded resolve, he pressed on.
Eastward he journeyed to propagate the Buddha’s teachings,
harmonizing with the Tathāgata,
verifying the fruit of the true and constant Dao.

**Exhortation Against Nets and Traps**

Since birth, I have never feared death.
With roots deeply anchored,
one verifies the position of long life.
All sentient beings share no slight difference.
May all be universally safe—
this is the will of Heaven.

Wielding compassion,
presenting refined auspices,
radiant clouds and rosy mists arise,
myriad rays of auspicious light.
The lofty immortals of the three realms rejoice in the Dharma,
safeguarding all people,
each free from calamity and harm.

**Exhortation to the Deluded**

Alas, the deluded, like the deeply drunk,
dare to scheme and contend,
disputing heaven and earth.
Killing, stealing, lust, and deceit violate divine principles.
Ever ignorant,
heedless of the impending judgment.

When qi returns to emptiness and form decays,
consciousness flickers faintly,
wandering into the dark prison.
Who will release the boundless wronged souls?
Whips lash their bodies,
serpents and dogs vie to devour them.

**Exhortation to Boatmen**

I urge you all to take an oath:
lay aside your nets and traps,
seek livelihoods in kindness.
The gods and spirits watch over you.
May your blessings and longevity multiply,
and may you savor sweetness anew.

Attain true joy, cast off filth.
With a nature perfectly luminous,
all dharmas are relinquished.
Quietly observe the wellspring of spirit arise in elegance.
Return to youth, reclaiming
the realm of pure coolness.

**Three Exhortations on Cultivation**

Discern the Three Fields, unblock the Eight Vessels.
Nine revolutions of radiance,
a single speck of dust cannot intervene.
Unfettered true compassion flows into the obscure and silent.
The cinnabar treasure and spiritual sprout
bear the hues of blue, yellow, and white.

Pierce the Kun Palace, the abode of the immortal cassia.
The divine pearl emerges and retreats,
beyond the void, blazing crimson.
I exhort the transient guests of the dusty world:
gather your hearts early,
and complete the true merit.

**Again**

To cultivate, you must thoroughly investigate.
Grasp the wellspring of spirit,
lest the cinnabar elixir leak away.
This practice is rare in the world.
Within, attain the wholeness of spirit;
without, attain longevity of body.

Discern the harmonious merging, illuminate the union.
Jade liquid and nectar,
swallowing the brilliance of the Three Lights.
Circulating above and below, completing the nine nines,
bursting through the Gate of Heaven,
forever befriending the mist and rosy clouds.

**Again**

In the white lotus pond, the golden liquid marsh,
dragons sport with luminous pearls,
purple mists ever encircling.
Tigers charge the flock of sheep at the mountain’s base.
Startled, the white ox leaps
by the winding river’s edge.

The red simurgh soars, the vermilion phoenix cries.
The infant at the sea’s bottom
holds fast, laughing with the tortoise and serpent.
The yellow sprout grows through each joint.
Within yin, yang is born—
how many truly know this?

**To Li Yiweng of Penglai**

Speaking of cultivation, you have been granted favor.
Truly turn your heart,
why cling to wife and children?
A true man does not let others count his debts.
Through the bitter sea he roams,
seeking a path forward.

Escape the dusty world, emerge from the dark abode.
The seven ancestors who have passed
are delivered and ascend on cloud steps.
Having escaped the wheel of rebirth, you gradually awaken.
When merit is complete and practice fulfilled,
you shall surely be summoned by the Three Purities.

**On Encountering Opportunities for Transformation**

Meeting the conditions for practice, encountering wise friends,
the Dharma water irrigates the heart,
each drop penetrating with numinous clarity.
Gathered in the furnace, nothing strays outward.
The two qi ascend and merge,
inverting and converging in auspicious radiance.

Piercing the Mud Pill, flowing behind the elbows,
day and night diligently,
not allowing the slightest leak.
Seizing the Mystery Pearl, presenting it with skillful hands,
stepping on clouds toward the azure sky,
only then is the great Dao accomplished.

**Gazing Toward Penglai (To the Tune of "Wang Jiangnan") – Four Poems**

**Sent to Master Chaoyuan**

Master Chaoyuan,
especially intimate with the Dao.
The good karma of past vows manifests today,
the wondrous fruit of the future unfolds anew.
Day by day, it grows ever clearer.

Mastering creation,
beyond the void, the moon chariot races.
Recognizing the original, inherently pure master,
the Jade Terrace and Penglai Paradise bloom in all seasons.
Only then is one called a person of this realm.

**Instructing Disciples**

Disciples of cultivation,
search meticulously beyond the mundane.
Having left the household, you must cherish your blessings,
each increasing merit and conduct through the seasons.
Let all affairs rest.

Maintain inner illumination,
the moon of the heart pressing the cloud’s head.
The two substances merge and harmonize into the great elixir,
flowing and circulating through the Three Passes, ever replenishing.
Grasp the root in the Primordial Sea.

**To the Young Disciples**

Young disciples,
study texts and arts with care.
Let no affair scatter the heart’s focus,
forgetting passions, sealing speech to nurture harmonious radiance.
Only then may the inner elixir’s method unfold.

With clarity ever growing,
the single nature turns gentle and kind.
The essence of Confucian grace and the Dao’s truth—
if one can wield both without conflict,
brightly they journey to the immortal realm.

**Expressing Aspiration**

The Dao of Heaven,
its wondrous workings never falsely transmitted.
A single point gives rise to the true dharma-nature,
the Two Modes forge the transcendent immortal.
With each step, golden lotuses form.

Lucid and bright,
inversion reveals the root source.
The Four Great sustain true water and fire,
the Five Lights illumine the ninefold heavens.
The seven ancestors all attain the morning of origin.
