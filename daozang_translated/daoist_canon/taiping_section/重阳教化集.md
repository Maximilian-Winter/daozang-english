**The Precepts of the Authentic Master of Chongyang: The Golden Lock and Jade Barrier**

The Chongyang Master of Zhongnan Mountain, Wang Zhuozhe, composed:

Someone asked: *"What is the supreme principle of cultivating the True Way?"*
The Master replied: *"First, eliminate nameless afflictions; second, abstain from craving for wine, sex, wealth, and fortune. This is the method of cultivation."*

The human body contains all the principles of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things, and the myriad things fill the space between Heaven and Earth. Yet the lofty and vast nature of Heaven and Earth is never obscured by the myriad things. Those who cultivate must embody this principle in all affairs.

Someone posed a difficulty: *"Heaven has darkness, Earth has tremors, mountains crumble, seas dry up, and the sun and moon wax and wane. Moreover, humans fall ill and face death—how can these be addressed?"*
The Master answered: *"To rectify them, one must attain the methods of the Most High (太上, Tàishàng) to refine the Five Phases (五行, Wǔxíng)."*

Someone asked: *"What are the methods of the Five Phases?"*
The Precepts stated: *"First, one must uphold precepts: maintain purity, endure hardship with patience, practice compassionate goodness, sever the Ten Evils (十恶, Shí'è), act skillfully, and rescue all sentient beings. Serve the sovereign with loyalty, honor parents and teachers with filial piety—these are the methods of cultivation. Then, practice the True Function."*

The Precepts further stated: *"Within the body, East and West must be discerned as Gēng-Jiǎ-Wù-Yǒu (庚甲卯酉). Second, within the body, South and North must be discerned as Kǎn-Lǐ-Qiān-Yóng (坎离铅汞)."*

The Precepts explained: *"Gēng-Jiǎ-Wù-Yǒu refers to day and night. Jiǎ-Wù (甲卯) is the **qi** of the liver. During the eight seasonal nodes of *Lìchūn* (立春) and *Chūnfèn* (春分), the mouth produces saliva (津, jīn). Gēng-Yǒu (庚酉) is the **qi** of the lungs. During the eight seasonal nodes of *Lìqiū* (立秋) and *Qiūfèn* (秋分), the mouth produces fluid (液, yè). Kǎn-Lǐ (坎离) refers to cold and heat. Lǐ-Qiān (离铅) is the **qi** of the heart. During the eight seasonal nodes of *Lìxià* (立夏) and *Xiàzhì* (夏至), the body’s **qi** manifests as blood (血, xuè). Kǎn-Yóng (坎汞) is the **qi** of the kidneys. During the eight seasonal nodes of *Lìdōng* (立冬) and *Dōngzhì* (冬至), the body’s **qi** manifests as essence (精, jīng). Essence gives rise to the shadow (魄, pò), blood to the spirit (魂, hún). Essence is one’s innate nature (性, xìng), blood is one’s life (命, mìng). Those who grasp the nature and life are practicing the True Way."*

The Precepts stated: *"Essence and blood are the foundation of the physical form. True **qi** is the foundation of nature and life. Thus, it is said: ‘Where there is blood, true **qi** can arise.’ When true **qi** is robust and complete, longevity naturally follows, as essence and blood coalesce into form."*

Someone asked: *"If one is already human, why do they experience death and decay in sequence? What is the reason?"*
The Master answered: *"Those who die early are those whose minds cling to sensual pleasures and cravings for the world. Men waste their essence, women deplete their blood. If one does not sever nameless afflictions by day nor slay the Three Corpses (三尸, Sānshī) and dark spirits (阴鬼, yīnguǐ) by night, then men and women alike will face death."*

Someone asked: *"What makes one immortal?"*
The Master answered: *"The immortal are those whose bodies are pure and without defilement, who preserve their true **qi** in the elixir field (丹田, Dāntián), whose essence and blood do not diminish—these are the ones who do not die."*

Someone posed a difficulty: *"Yet many today practice purity and abstain from wives, yet still fail to attain the Way—why is this?"*
The Master answered: *"Though such people may be outwardly pure, they do not grasp the True Function of purity. Their bodies may be still, but their minds are not. They may be pure in form, yet their intentions are not. Have you not heard the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness (清静经, Qīngjìng Jīng)* say: ‘The Dao has clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness. Clarity is the source of turbidity, movement the foundation of stillness.’ The Scripture also says: ‘Neither defiled nor pure.’ If one speaks of True Purity and Stillness, then: ‘The eyes produce no tears, the nose no pus, the mouth no saliva, and there is no need to refine the large and small excretions. Men preserve their essence, women stabilize their blood, and all malevolent influences return to harmony while all diseases do not arise.’ Only then is the elixir field truly pure and still. The purity and stillness spoken of by people today are merely hollow names."*

*"Cultivation, when inner and outer align, does not first speak of the Great Vehicle (大乘, Dàshèng), but rather the Small Vehicle (小乘, Xiǎoshèng). The *Heart Sutra (心经, Xīn Jīng)* states: ‘Capable of both small and great, it does not first speak of the past, but rather the present.’ The past refers to the fruit, the present to the function. It further says: ‘When function is complete and fruit is fulfilled, it does not first speak of the True, but rather the False.’ Only the One Spirit (一灵, Yīlíng) is True; the four great elements (肉身四大, Ròushēn Sìdà) of the physical body are False appearances. One refines the False to attain the True, merging them as one."*

The Precepts stated: *"Present comfort in the body is the Small Vehicle, the root of the Great Vehicle. The initial stage of the Way, the heart is the Small Vehicle, the fruit is the Great Vehicle. The Small Vehicle is the root, the Great Vehicle the branch. The Precepts say: ‘The branch and root rely upon each other; the branch borrows the root to flourish.’ The Precepts further say: ‘All arise from yin and yang, relying upon the father’s essence and mother’s blood—these are the body’s foundation. Yet people today cultivate without preserving the father’s essence and mother’s blood, dissipating their true **qi**, damaging their primal yang (元阳, Yuánsāng). Thus, they age, age brings illness, and illness leads to death. Since death is inevitable, why not address it?"*

*"The True Dao is such: in emptiness there is reality, in reality there is emptiness. The Scripture says: ‘The Great Dao is formless, yet gives birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao is nameless, yet nourishes all things.’ Those born from true nature are likewise. In ancient times, the Venerable Lord Lao (老君, Lǎojūn) refined gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, leaving behind three profound teachings of the Great Vehicle: each line eradicates sins, each phrase brings longevity. The first is ‘Divine Immortals embrace the One (神仙抱一, Shénxiān Bào Yī)’, the second is ‘Wealth and peace for the realm and its people (富国安民, Fùguó Ānmín)’, the third is ‘Strengthened armies and victory in battle (强兵战胜, Qiángbīng Zhànshèng).’"*

Someone asked: *"What is ‘Divine Immortals embrace the One’?"*
**[The Master replied:]** *"‘Embrace the One’ refers to the fundamental essence of all beings under Heaven."*

「The **One** (一, *Yī*) is the fundamental essence of all things under Heaven. The **One** is the **Dao/Way** (道, *Dào*). In ancient times, the **One** at its inception was **True Water** (真水, *Zhēnshuǐ*). From True Water, **qi** (气, *qì*) arises; from **qi**, True Water arises again. All things under Heaven originate from the **One**, which then nurtures them. The **One** gives rise to the **Two**, the **Two** to the **Three**, and the **Three** to all things.

Within the **Three**, the **Four** manifest as **wisdom’s functions** (四智功, *Sìzhì Gōng*), the **Five** as **eyes awakened** (五眼恁起, *Wǔyǎn Nènqǐ*), the **Six** as **senses cleansed** (六根扫荡, *Liùgēn Sǎodàng*), the **Seven** as **spirits unfurled** (七魄运开, *Qīpò Yùnkāi*), the **Eight** as **trigrams expounded** (八卦说, *Bāguà Shuō*), and the **Nine** as **true reflections of the Dao** (九思真道, *Jiǔsī Zhēndào*). To rely on the **fruits of the unexhausted** (无漏果, *Wúlòu Guǒ*) in perfect harmony, and to let the mind and thoughts naturally extend within the **elixir field** (丹田, *Dāntián*), guarding the **original qi** (元炁, *Yuánguì*), without letting it disperse—this is the method of **embracing the One** (抱一, *Bàoyī*).

Someone asked: *"What is ‘wealth and peace for the realm and its people’?"*
**[The Master replied:]**: *"Within the bodies of men and women, each possesses the **Nine Rivers and Four Seas** (九江四海, *Jiǔjiāng Sìhǎi*), the **Dragon Palaces** (龙宫, *Lónggōng*). In their **treasuries** (库藏, *Kùcáng*), there lie the **Seven Treasures and Eight Jewels** (七珍八宝, *Qīzhēn Bābǎo*). Do not let the **Six Thieves** (六贼, *Liùzéi*) steal them—this is the way of **wealth and peace for the realm and its people** (富国安民, *Fùguó Ānmín*).*

Someone asked: *"What is ‘strengthened armies and victory in battle’?"*
**[The Master replied:]**: *"The way of **victory in battle** (战胜, *Zhànshèng*) is something few in the world know. Victory in battle is the **constant principle** (常之法, *Chángzhī Fǎ*).*
**Difficulty:** *"Since you have spoken of the **Pure and Quiet** (清静, *Qīngjìng*) method, why do you mention the principle of **victory in battle**?"*
**Resolution:** *"The common people do not grasp the method of **victory in battle**, and thus they cannot cure illness and the **impermanence** (无常, *Wúcháng*) of suffering. The way of **victory in battle** is as follows: First, **vanquish nameless afflictions** (无名烦恼, *Wúmíng Fánnǎo*); second, in the **nightly realm** (夜间境, *Yèjiān Jìng*), **defeat the Three Corpses and Ghostly Thieves** (三尸阴鬼, *Sānshī Yīnguǐ*); third, **overcome all dharmas** (万法, *Wànfǎ*). This is the method of **victory in battle**.*

If one attains the **Three Vehicles** (三乘, *Sānshèng*), they transform **suffering and afflictions** (殃恼, *Yāngnǎo*) into **blessings** (福, *Fú*). For those who practice the **Dao/Way**, the **Pure and Quiet** (清静, *Qīngjìng*) method is the foundation of the **Great Vehicle** (大乘, *Dàshèng*). To become a practitioner of the Great Vehicle, one must first begin with the **Small Vehicle** (小乘, *Xiǎoshèng*). **Purity does not depart from impurity** (清不离浊, *Qīngbùlí Zhuó*), **movement does not depart from stillness** (动不离静, *Dòngbùlí Jìng*), yet within stillness, movement arises, and within impurity, purity emerges.

There are **Heaven and Earth** (天地, *Tiāndì*), **Sun and Moon** (日月, *Rìyuè*), **Water and Fire** (水火, *Shuǐhuǒ*), and **Yin and Yang** (阴阳, *Yīnyáng*)—these are called **True Dao/Way** (真道, *Zhēndào*). The **sutra** (经, *Jīng*) says: *“Pure Yang without creation, Pure Yin without growth; when Yin and Yang harmonize, they give birth to all things.”* Yet today’s practitioners of the **Dao/Way** do not practice the **True Dao/Way**.

The **Dao/Way** is the **enlightenment of life and death** (了达性命, *Liǎodá Xìngmìng*), and **life and death** (性命, *Xìngmìng*) are the **essence and blood** (精血, *Jīngxuè*). All the myriad diseases of humanity stem from harm to one’s **life and death** (命, *Mìng*). Those who suffer from illness do not affect the **Five Zang** (五脏, *Wǔzàng*) directly; rather, they diminish the **Three Treasures** (精、气、血三宝, *Jīng, qì, xuè sānbǎo*)—**essence, qi, and blood**. If one seeks **peace and longevity** (安乐长生, *Ānlè Chángshēng*), they must hold fast to the **awareness of purity and stillness** (清静之识, *Qīngjìngzhī Shí*).

Even those not yet **out of the household** (出家, *Chūjiā*), in their youth, may not uphold the **fruits of purity and stillness** (清静之果, *Qīngjìngzhī Guǒ*) and thus begin with the **Small Vehicle**. They then ascend to the **Middle Vehicle** (中乘, *Zhōngshèng*) and the **Great Vehicle** (上乘, *Shàngshèng*). The **first stage** (初地, *Chūdì*) is the **awakening of the dharma-mind** (达法心, *Dáfǎxīn*)—this is the **Small Vehicle**. Those who **realize enlightenment** (觉悟者, *Juéwùzhě*) belong to the **Middle Vehicle**. Those who **fully comprehend** (了达者, *Liǎodázhě*) belong to the **Great Vehicle**.

The **first** is the **City of Transformation** (化城, *Huàchéng*), the **second** is the **City of Silver** (银城, *Yínchéng*), the **third** is the **City of Gold** (金城, *Jīnchéng*). Like a single great tree: first, there is its **root**; then, its **twigs**. As always, one should **abide in purity and stillness** (清静, *Qīngjìng*)—this is the **true path** (正道, *Zhèngdào).*

「The Master was asked: *"Suppose one’s body is in a state of purity and stillness, yet one encounters a day of celestial demons—how should one respond? And if one meets an external heretic (波巡), how should one treat them?"*
The Master replied: *"波巡 refers to the boundaries of the realm. All realms have their limits—one must only grasp the three essentials of advance and retreat and distinguish between purity and impurity. If encountering forces of yin and yang, one must add fire to water to clarify the turbid—this is the method of non-coagulation."*

The secret formula states: *"When demonic armies arrive, one must prepare swiftly, inspecting the three thousand strong soldiers."* The secret formula continues: *"The three thousand cures of true function."* These "strong soldiers" are the **qi**. When they come and do not depart, accumulated over a thousand breaths, their **qi** remains in the **dantian** without dispersing—only warmth is taught, not coldness—thus forming the embryonic **xian** (immortal), the supreme method.

If one attains such supreme mastery, one will forever possess this true function. When the work is complete and the fruit is ripe, one will forever achieve peace and eternal life.

All practitioners, when facing calamity, must prepare with caution.

The Master was asked: *"How should one respond?"*
The Master explained: *"When one faces calamity, one first perceives the signs of death."*

The Master was asked: *"What are the signs of death?"*
The secret formula states: *"When the celestial pillar trembles, trees fall and mountains crumble, the six spirits are in chaos, life and essence cannot be preserved, the spirit wanders in confusion, the heavens darken, and the sun and moon lose their light—this is the seed of impermanence. A body with leaks is hell; a fruit without leaks is paradise. Those with leaky bodies must attain the perfect fruit without leaks to fulfill the Dao’s fruit."*

The Master was asked: *"If the White Ox departs, how should one capture it?"*
The secret formula states: *"When the White Ox departs, strike the **xuan** (mystic) gate urgently, firmly securing the four gates. Use the immortal’s fishing method, and with the Three Island hand seal, point toward the Yellow River flowing backward. Cover the Golden Gate and merge with the Jade Lock. As if beheading the White Ox, it will naturally not flee—this is the method of the machine emerging from water to reach the other shore."*

There are ten methods to stabilize life and essence. The secret formula states:
*"The first is the Golden Gate Jade Lock stabilization;
The second is the Three Island revival and exchange of life and death stabilization;
The third is the Nine Bend Yellow River reverse-flow stabilization.
These are the methods for those who attain the perfect fruit without leaks to fulfill the Dao of immortality. If one stabilizes the precious **qi**, do not let it stagnate the waist and legs or dim the eyes—this is the method of stabilizing the three treasures."*

The Master was asked: *"If one stabilizes the three treasures and transports them to be stored where?"*
The secret formula states: *"First, use the method of piercing the knees with reed sprouts, boiling the **qi** in the treasure furnace, and transporting the bones’ **qi** to the surging spring, supplementing the two feet. Then, practice the seven returns of the elixir. If the **qi** stagnates and weakens the waist and legs, perform the Iron Chariot Black Ox function, then open the slaughter gate. If one attains the real **yuan** (primordial) **qi** filling the abdomen, first practice the method of flying golden crystals from the elbow. If one does not practice these methods—neither piercing the knees nor the seven returns of the Three Islands—then practice transporting essence from the elbow to supplement the brain, seeking eternal youth and life. Today’s practitioners focus on the upper body but neglect the lower, like a child building a tower with an unstable foundation."*

The Master explained: *"How does one ensure the middle **qi**’s essence is firm and stable? Then, at the **kan** (water) palace, use the three vehicles—Sheep, Deer, and Great Ox—to transport the treasure from Jing Mountain."*

The secret formula states: *"Near Jing Mountain, there was a man named Bian He. One day, while carving mountains for firewood, he saw a phoenix perched on a stone. Bian He knew there was treasure within, so he presented it to the emperor, who flew into a rage and had Bian He’s feet amputated."*

The secret formula explains: *"Bian He represents insight; the stubborn stone is the mind. The phoenix is true **qi**, forming the body. The jade is the marrow’s essence within the bones. Amputation symbolizes failing to practice piercing the knees."*

The secret formula states: *"Practicing purity and stillness is called completing the lower treasure—like the sun and moon. Then, use the three vehicles to transport it to the peak of Kunlun. Alas, today’s people can speak but cannot create, can explain but cannot reveal the secrets. They say, ‘The heart practices, but the intention does not move.’ Today’s people are mostly deluded and do not cultivate the body."*

The Master instructed: *"When practicing, rise at the **zi** and **wu** hours in the sitting posture, rubbing the hands. As true **qi** seethes through the body, pass the heavenly bridge and the forehead—only guide the **qi** to the upper and lower jaws. With intention, divide the true **qi**, letting it circulate downward. The **yuan** essence of the sun falls into the jaws, flowing from the left corner of the mouth to the right, gathering the saliva as the **xuan** pearl and sweet dew. With the Red Dragon, stir it evenly until it settles, then rinse it as snow-white flowers—it has a sweet taste. The mouth is the eight-colored glass canal, where one essence produces eight flavors of water, and two waters can generate the eight consciousnesses."*

The Master said: *"The mouth contains the hidden true **qi**. Within the true **qi** are divided the eight **guà**—**Gèn** for the start of spring, **Zhèn** for the spring equinox, **Xùn** for the start of summer, **Lí** for the summer solstice, **Kūn** for the start of autumn, **Duì** for the autumn equinox, **Qián** for the start of winter, and **Kǎn** for the winter solstice.

Within the eight **guà**, each produces **yīn** and **yáng**; within **yīn** and **yáng**, each divides into cold and heat.
The key is this: Swallowing saliva is **yīn**; guiding the **qi** afterward is **yáng**. One must seek the **yīn** and **yáng** waters of **xuan** pearl and sweet dew, swallowing them in three parts, leaving two to rest, lest the tree wither and exhaust itself.
It is also said: 'Cherish the water, lest it flow into the rivers and be cut off.'

Regarding the seven returns, the key is this: When swallowing the **shén** water to the **qì kē** (vital node), the lungs transform it into fluid, which effectively treats all coughs and wheezes, gradually arising from the **pò** (ethereal soul).
It is also said: When swallowing saliva to the heart, it opens one’s mind to enlightenment, and it is the **xīnshén** (heart-mind) water that washes the heart to reveal true nature.

The hymn says: 'Seeing the five-petaled flower bloom, step by step ascending to the Immortal Platform.
The **shén** water transforms into blood; swallowing the **shén** water to the liver, the liver being wood, is called the **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon). When the dragon receives water, it thrives, effectively treating all eye ailments, and the **qi** transforms into saliva.
Swallowing the **shén** water to the spleen, the spleen being earth, when earth receives water, it produces the yellow sprout.

The abdomen contains the large and small intestines, winding nine times, reaching the navel’s center—one inch and three **fēn** (fingers), round like a coin, one inch in diameter—left green, right white, front red, back black, and center yellow, named the **Dāntián** (Elixir Field).
Within the Field stands a palace, named the **Huángtínggōng** (Yellow Court Palace).
There is a small mound within, called the **Dāntuó** (Elixir Mound).
On the mound sits a single golden **dǐng** (cauldron), below which true fire is constantly fed, and above which **shén** water is constantly added.
The water and fire are **Kǎn** and **Lí** (the **guà** of water and fire).
This fire and water are the **jūn** fire (sovereign fire), **chén** fire (minister fire), and **mín** fire (common fire); these three fires are the true flavors, the heart, nature, and intention.

Nowadays, people have not yet comprehended these three aspects: the first flavor is not clear, the second not enlightened, and the third, wisdom cannot yet attain the **Dao**. If one attains these three aspects, one achieves the **sān míng liù tōng** (three clarities and six penetrations).
When feeding the fire, one washes above with water and tempers below with fire.
The scripture says: 'Fire emerges from below the body, water from above; when the upper unites with the lower and the lower seals the upper, **Qián** and **Kūn** (heaven and earth) harmonize, commanding the dragon to coil around the golden **dǐng** and the tiger to retreat from the **Dāntián**, this is the marvelous method.'
It is called the **Tuó dāo guī** (Mound-Knife Pill).

If one practices this method, they will forever attain peace, comfort, and longevity.

The question arises: 'Why does one speak of the **Tuó dāo guī** as a single grain, why as self-administered **Tuó dāo guī**, and why as **Tiělí Tuó dāo guī**?'
The key is this: The three **Tuó dāo guī** are treasures—**jīng** (essence), **qi**, and blood.
The key is this: The **single grain Tuó dāo guī** is the saliva; the **self-administered Tuó dāo guī** is swallowing saliva and ingesting **qi**; the **Tiělí Tuó dāo guī** is the true **qi** in practice, unchanging and unretreatable, driving all malevolent forces to rectification.
As when practicing, if hungry, one eats **jīn fàn** (golden food); if thirsty, one drinks **yù jiāng** (jade nectar). When cold, one feeds the fire; when hot, one adds the water.
The fire is true **yáng**; the water is true **yīn**.
This method is the art of **drawing, supplementing, reducing, and adding**.

The key is this: **Drawing** is collecting true **qi** from above; **supplementing** is drawing warm **qi** from below into the **Dāntián**. If one warms the **shèn gōng** (kidney palace), all diseases will be dispelled.

The question arises: 'Why do both men and women sometimes suffer sudden, irregular illnesses?'
The answer is this: It is because all men and women are entangled in desires, pleasures, and attachments to the world. By day, they cannot cease nameless vexations; by night, within the realm of senses, they cannot sever the **sān shī** (three corpses)—**yīn guǐ** (demonic spirits)—and thus men deplete their **jīng**, women deplete their blood-**qi**. The three treasures flee, and the original **yáng** is lost, hence the irregular illnesses.

If one does not heed the words of the **shénxiān** (immortal sages), it is like a leaky, ruined house—if the owner does not repair it, the palace collapses, damaging its beams and pillars, and thus one falls ill.

The difficulty is this: 'Why do even children, who are pure and undisturbed, not deplete the three treasures yet still suffer irregular illnesses?'
The key is this: Children who are sick were, in their past lives, conceived in their mother’s womb when her blood-**qi** was deficient. They did not receive the full ten months of prenatal **qi**, or they were exposed to **winds, excesses, heat, and dampness**, or the four **jì** (seasons) were not properly observed, causing the child to be born with irregular illnesses.

The question arises: 'Why are there those with ugly or beautiful appearances?'
The key is this: Those with a **zhèng** (correct) appearance were conceived when their parents’ **yīn** and **yáng** were harmonized with the **sun** and **moon**—before the **wǔ** hour and after the **chǒu** hour—thus attaining true beauty, longevity, and prosperity. Their correct appearance brings joy to their parents.
If conceived after the **wǔ** hour or before the **chǒu** hour, they may have deformed appearances—such as illness, deafness, muteness, or stunted growth—often with inferior natures, displeasing to others, short lives, and lack of prosperity. This is the foundation of **zào huà** (creation).

The question arises: 'If one encounters a **yuān mó** (grievous demon), how should one treat it?'
The key is this: **Qīngjìng** (purity and stillness) is essential.
In haste, steal moments of calm; in calm, seek stillness.
When facing difficulties, one must swiftly retreat.
The **xīn wáng** (heart-king) must employ the **guàn xiǎng** (pervasive visualization) method, urgently driving the **shén yì** (spiritual intention) into the **shàng ní wán** (upper brain palace), sitting upright and visualizing: before the eyes, Immortal Men and Women dance with celestial music, striking the teeth and settling the mind, gazing upon the **Kūnlún** Mountain’s scenery, seeing the **shàng niú** (upper ox), **yáng** (sheep), **lù** (deer), **mǎ** (horse), and **yù tù** (jade rabbit), and with intention, seizing and binding them above.
At the time of practice, suddenly imagine a treasure tree above, with flowers blooming and bearing fruit. With intention, pluck and swallow the fruit—those who consume this will forever attain peace, comfort, and longevity.
This is the method of rectification; one sentence comprehended, the great **láo** (barrier) secures the four gates.
The key is this: **Xué hǎi mìng mén qì dìng** (the blood sea at the life gate is stabilized), **wú kāi bì hù jīng dìng** (the door of essence is neither opened nor closed), **bù sī wài jìng shén dìng** (the spirit is undisturbed by external affairs)."

The **essence and blood** that scatter are the **nature and life**. The **single-minded intent** is the **true sovereign**.

The **teeth** are the **Mystic Pass** (*Xuānguān*), the **closing of the elixir field** is the **lower Mystic Pass**, the **raising of the golden essence** to the upper pass is the **Golden Pass** (*Jīnguān*), and the **tight clenching of the teeth** is the **Jade Lock** (*Yùsuǒ*). When the **six senses** remain unmoved, this is the **Six Degrees** (*Liùdù*), called the **Universal Pass** (*Dōuguān*).

The **lower intake of the upper cheek** is the **Vertex Yang Pass** (*Dǐngyángguān*), the **nose** is the **Heavenly Gate** (*Tiānmén*), and the **spine’s cleft** is the **Double Pass** (*Shuāngguān*). When performing the work, all locks open simultaneously.

When the **spirit** does not move, the **intent** does not stray. The **intent** is **flickering**—this is the method of **clarity and stillness**.

In **spring, summer, autumn, and winter**, if a child’s urine is **yellow**, it means the **elixir field** is **emptied and decayed**, having lost the **lower source**. To **preserve the true qi**, urgently use the **method of piercing the Nine Curves** (*Chuān Jiǔqū*), also called the **Nine Circulations of piercing the small intestine** (*Jiǔzhuàn Chuān xiǎocháng*). The **true qi** will **nine times penetrate the kidney hall**, and the urine will naturally become **greenish-white**. Then, the body will attain **peace and comfort**.

**Question:** What is the **method of the Three Vehicles** (*Sānshèng zhī fǎ*)?

---

**Question:** What is the **method of the Three Vehicles** (*Sānshèng zhī fǎ*)?

**Answer:** The **method of the Three Vehicles** is as follows: the **lower Vehicle** (*xiàshèng*) is like a newborn babe, the **middle Vehicle** (*zhōngshèng*) is like a child sitting on the ground, and the **upper Vehicle** (*shàngshèng*) is like a child walking.

If one attains these **Three Vehicles**, they transcend the **Three Realms**—the **Realm of Desire** (*yùjiè*), the **Realm of Form** (*sèjiè*), and the **Formless Realm** (*wúsèjiè*). This reveals the **Threefold Nature** of the mind and body: the **Law-body** (*fǎshēn*) of **clarity and stillness**, the **Reward-body** (*bàoshēn*) of **perfection**, and the **Transformation-body** (*hùeshēn*) of **threefold meditation**.

Each of these has its own **manifested spirit** (*xiǎnjì zhī shén*). The first is the **method of the Highest Venerable** refining the **Wood of A and B**—this is the **Empty Plain** (*xūtǎn*), where the **Highest Venerable** (*Tàishàng*) teaches the **Laozi** in **green robes**, guiding the **Three Thousand Green-Robed Daoists** (*sānqiān qīngyī dào shì*). He leaves behind the **Nine Circulations of Piercing the Small Intestine** (*Jiǔzhuàn Chuān xiǎocháng*), specifically the **Ninefold Transformation of the Elixir’s Greenish-Yellow Sprout** (*Dānhuángyá Chuān xī*), a **supreme method** lost to the world.

The second is the **method of Śākyamuni Buddha**, refining the **Fire of C and D** (*jiàn diǎnfāng bǐngdīng huǒ*)—the body clad in the **flaming robe of the monastic order** (*lièhuà jiāshā*), where the **Three Thousand Red Children** (*sānqiān chìzǐ*)—the **monks and nuns** (*bīqú sēngrén*)—leave behind the **Twelvefold *Mahāyāna Sūtras*** (*Dàshèng zūn jīng shí’èrbù*). He also transmits the **method of striking the Ninefold Iron Drum** (*shè jiǔchóng tiěgǔ*) and the **Ninefold Transformation of the Reed Sprout** (*Lúyá Chuān xī*).

The **Dragon Flower Triple Assembly** (*Lónghuá Sān huì*)—where the **Master** (*fūzǐ*) in the **Confucian Study Hall of Lu** (*Lǔguó xíxué táng*)—refines the **Metal of G and H** (*jiàn xīfāng gēngxīn jīn*) for the **Three Thousand White-Robed Laymen** (*sānqiān báiyī jūshì*). He leaves behind the **Ten Volumes of the *Analects*** (*Lúnyǔ shí juàn*), along with the **method of piercing the Nine Curves with the Clear Pearl** (*Míngzhū Chuān Jiǔqū*) and the **Ninefold Transformation of the Reed Sprout** (*Lúyá Chuān xī*).

The **Three Teachings** are like the **three legs of a cauldron**—their essence converges into **One**. There is no duality, no triplicity; the **Three Teachings** do not depart from the **True Dao** (*zhēndào*).

**Illustration:** It is like a single tree bearing three branches.

**Question:** Within the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*), how many ranks of **Immortal** (*shénxiān*) are there?

**Answer:** The *Collection of Transmissions* (*Zhuàn Dàojí*) mentions **five ranks of Immortals** (*wǔ děng shénxiān*). The first rank does not uphold **precepts** (*jìe*), does not abstain from **alcohol and meat** (*jiǔròu*), does not refrain from killing, and does not cultivate **virtue** (*shàn*). Such are the **Ghostly Immortals** (*guǐxiān*).

The second rank cultivates **True Qi** (*zhēnqì*) for longevity and becomes **Earthly Immortals** (*dìxiān*).

The third rank loves **warfare** (*zhànzhēng*) and is called **Sword Immortals** (*jiànxiān*).

The fourth rank practices **sitting meditation** (*dǎzuò xiūxíng*) and is known as **Spirit Immortals** (*shénxiān*).

The fifth rank honors **teachers and elders**, **parents and children**, and practices the **Six Perfections** (*liùdù*) and **Ten Thousand Benevolent Means** (*wànxíng fāngbiàn*) to save all beings, cutting off the **Ten Evils** (*shí’è*), refraining from killing, and abstaining from **alcohol and meat** (*jiǔròu*). They embody **righteousness without deceit**, their **intent harmonizes with the Heavenly Mind** (*yì tóng tiānxīn*), and their **conduct is straight and unselfish** (*zhèngzhí wú sīqū*). Such are called **Heavenly Immortals** (*tiānxiān*).

When one first awakens to **good intent** (*shànxīn*), that is the **auspicious land** (*jíxiáng zhī dì*). For those who practice **great cultivation** (*dà xiūxíng*) in the **good dharma**, there are **prohibitions** (*jìn jì*) to observe.

**Prohibition:** In the **fifth and sixth months**, and the **twelfth month**, one must **preserve clarity and stillness** (*qīngjìng*), avoiding great disturbances.

Additionally, the **fifth and sixth months** are months of **great slaughter** (*dà shā*), so men must not approach women, lest they suffer the **Five Strains and Seven Injuries** (*wǔ láo qī shāng*). Men who damage their **vital essence and blood** (*jīngxiě qìyè*) lose their **life and vitality**, while women who damage their **vital essence** (*jīngxiě*) lose their **fertility**. This is because they harm the **True Qi of the Five Phases** (*wǔxíng zhēnqì*), resulting in **Five Strains** (*láo*), or the **Seven Treasures** (*qī bǎo*), causing **Seven Injuries** (*shāng*). All diseases arise from these imbalances.

**Question:** How do diseases originate?

**Answer:** All diseases stem from **improper alignment of the Eight Nodes** (*bājié bùzhèng zhī qì*).

**Question:** What are the **Eight Evils** (*bāxié*)?

**Answer:** The **Eight Evils** arise when **yin and yang** are **out of harmony** within the **Eight Trigrams** (*bāguà*), manifesting as **Eight Nodal Qi** (*bājié zhī qì*). They lead one into **evil** through **hunger, overindulgence, labor, exertion, wind, cold, heat, and dampness** (*jī lái tòng bǎo, hánjí yōuxīn, yuǎnxíng kùnjuàn, língrè shēnzuì*). During such times, one must not practice **internal alchemy** (*xínggōng*), as it may transform into **grave illness** (*dàbìng*), and **clarity and stillness** (*qīngjìng*) should be preserved.

When practicing, one must **collect the Jade Essence** (*Yùyè*) on the tongue, **collect the Primordial Yang** (*Yuányáng*) in the **Elixir Nose** (*Dānbí*), **collect the Golden Essence** (*Jīnyè*) in the **Elixir Kidney Hall** (*Dāngǔtáng*), and **fill the bones with the refined marrow and essence** (*rújīng suǐ mǎn gǔ shí*). Such a body, even after **a hundred years of death**, remains **unrotted** (*jīnggǔ bùjiě*), known as the **method of the Connected Child and the Pearl that Secures the Bones** (*Liánzǐ huán zhèn gǔ*).

**Prohibition:** The **Twenty-Four Great Prohibitions** (*èrshísì jìn*) for the **Great Elixir** (*Dàdān*) are the **Twenty-Four Qi of the Year** (*yīnián èrshísì qì*). If one wishes to seek **wondrous methods** (*miàojué*), they must first **calm their intent** (*yì zì xī*) and **surrender wealth and possessions** (*kěn shě zhòngjīn jìngcái*).

The first is **sacrificing one’s body** (*shěshēn bùshī*)—when one sees their **teachers, elders, parents, or children** in peril, they **offer their life to save another** (*shěmìng qiúmìng*).

The second is **presenting flowers to the teacher** (*jiānghuā xiànshī*)—when their **teachers or elders** are about to **scold or strike**, they must **welcome them with joy and smiles**, ensuring their face bears no **anger or resentment** (*miànshàng wú zhēnshù*).

The third is **preparing meals to honor the teacher** (*lìngshàn ér gōngyǎng*)—when food is **delicious**, they must first **offer it to their teacher** (*xiān fèng qí shī*). This is called the **Threefold Sacrifice** (*Sān bùshī*).

**The Immortals say:** **Perseverance** (*jiān*) is the **Dao**, and **joy** (*huānxǐ*) is the **connection** (*yuán*). If one does not **diligently seek their teacher** (*qióng qí shī*), how can they attain the **Dao**?

**Lu the Elder** (*Lǚ wēng*) says: Without the **teacher’s guidance** (*bùyīn shī zhǐ*), this matter is **difficult to know** (*cǐshì nánzhī*).

Again, it is said: **One who studies without understanding** (*xué ér bùzhì*) is not truly studying; **one who studies but does not follow their teacher** (*xué ér bùcóngshī*) is **stealing learning** (*dàoxué*), a **thief within the method**. If they **conceal their ancestral teachers** (*yǎn zǔshàng shīdé*), they **shorten their own lifespan** (*cù zìjǐ shòu*), just as ordinary people do.

**To exalt oneself while belittling the teacher** is to **hold fast to false pretenses** (*qīnggōng zuòzuò*), a **disruptive practice**. Can such a person truly attain the **Dao**?

**The Immortals say:** Those who **despise their teachers and slight the method** (*qīngshī mànfǎ*) are **unworthy of being teachers**. Those who have **not yet begun cultivation** (*wèixué xiūxíng*) but **already claim to save others** are **saving themselves**. All are **guided by their merits and virtues** (*píng gōngdé xíngrén*), each recognizing their own **ancestral lineage and scriptural authority** (*zǔzōng kēpái*).

The **Highest Venerable** (*Tàishàng*) is the **ancestor**, Śākyamuni is the **master**, and the **Master** (*fūzǐ*) is the **scriptural authority** (*kēpái*).

Since the **Three Teachings** have **fallen into stillness**, all men and women are **tossed in the River of Love** (*ài hé*) and **drift in the Sea of Suffering** (*kǔ hǎi*), enduring **affliction** (*fánnǎo*). They **sink into the Six Realms** (*liùdào chénlún*), neither **born nor extinguished**, neither **here nor gone**.

The **Holy Masters of the Three Teachings** (*Sān jiào shèngzhǔ*) and the **Holy Mothers of the Three Realms** (*Sān jiè shèngmǔ*) come to **save and guide their children** (*qiùlái jiùdù érnǚ*), with **names and manifestations** clearly recorded (*míng hào jì xiǎnbiān míng*). Their **lifespan seals** (*shòuyìn*) and **verification marks** (*xìn wéi*) serve as **proof of identity** (*qǎn tóng*).

**Explanation:** The **whole body** (*yīshēn*) is **complete** (*wéi quán*). Those who **receive precepts** (*shòu jìe*) are **recorded** (*wéi jì*), and those who **awaken in understanding** (*xīn wù liǎo dá*) are **verified by fire** (*wéi huǒ*). The *Sūtra of Meeting Requests* (*Suíqiú jīng*) states: The **Print of the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel** (*Rúyì bǎo yìn*) reveals its **name from the heart** (*cóngxīn xiǎn míng*), and those with **ten names** (*shí hào*) are the **Ten Good Deeds** (*shíshàn*) or the **Able Ones** (*néngrén*). The first name is **Primordial Cultivation** (*Yuán xiū*), the second is **Clarification of Transformation** (*Zhuǎn míng*), the third is **Penetration of the Three Realms** (*Tōng sānjiè*), the fourth is **Longevity** (*Chángshēng*), the fifth is **Manifestation of Radiance** (*Guāngmíng xiǎn*), the sixth is **Harmony of Intent** (*Yì tóng*), the seventh is **Master of the Whole Body** (*Quánshēn zhǔ*), the eighth is **Increase of Fortune and Wealth** (*Fúlù zēng*), the ninth is **Primordial Cultivation of Heaven** (*Tiān yuán xiū*), and the tenth is the **Able One** (*Néngrén*).

The **Primordial Dao** (*Yuán Dào*)—when **qi** (*qì*) is added to the **ten names** (*shí hào*), **impermeable virtue** (*wúlòu gōngdé*) naturally arises.

The **Three Teachings** (*sān jiào*) are those that, according to one’s will, transform and guide beings—all without departing from the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*).

The ancients spoke thus: *"Worldly affairs of life and death are profound."* Those who practice may suffer **birth, aging, sickness, and death** (*shēng lǎo bìng sǐ*), as well as **suffering** (*kǔ*). Yet people today do not recognize the **true Dao/Way** (*zhēn Dào*), often clinging to emptiness and thus falling into futility. Even now, they cannot grasp it—how then could they comprehend the **past** (*guòqù*)?

Moreover, the **Dharma Scripture** (*Dá Mó jīng*) states: *"The past is not spoken as true, the future is not considered real."*

The **Supreme Sage** (*Tàishàng*) refines the **Nine Transformations** (*jiǔ zhuǎn*) of the **Elixir** (*huán dān*), enabling one to **ward off sickness and illness** (*qù bìngjí*), **transcend life and death** (*liǎo shēngsǐ*).

**Master Confucius** (*Fūzǐ*) taught **benevolence** (*rén*), **righteousness** (*yì*), **propriety** (*lǐ*), **wisdom** (*zhì*), and **trustworthiness** (*xìn*), fearing that people might **invite karmic retribution** (*zhāo yè*) upon themselves. Yet, those who cultivate these virtues can also **treat their ailments** (*zhì qí jíbìng*).

**Question:** How does one **treat sickness and illness** (*bìngjí*)?
**Formula:** *"Remove the eyes—great remedy."* **Explanation:** *"Long-term joy is the remedy."* **Formula:** *"Joy is the root of this remedy. Constant vexation is the root of all diseases."*

Or, those who **abide in stillness and tranquility** (*cháng qīngjìng*) are the **sprouts of the Great Dao** (*dà Dào zhī miáo*).

Yet, observing today’s practitioners—be they **monks, Daoists, or those of the Five Precepts** (*wúguǎn sān jiào wǔjiè*)—men and women alike, one wonders: **Why do they face sickness, impermanence, and suffering**?

Or, **men and women who have partners yet lack spouses** (*yǒu fū wú fù*), their **Elisir Field** (*dān tián*) scatters the **Spirit Turtle** (*líng guī*), dissipating **true qi** (*zhēn qì*), leaving the **Lower Elixir Field** (*xià yuán*) cold and void—thus generating **all diseases** (*jiàn shēng wàn bìng*).

When **men abide in stillness for sixty-four days**, their **semen-qi** (*jīng qì*) is full; when **women abide in stillness for forty-nine days**, their **blood-qi** (*xuè qì*) is full.

**Extremes invert** (*wùjí zhě zé fǎn*): **stillness returns to motion** (*jìng wéi dòng fǎn*), **clarity returns to turbidity** (*qīng wéi zhuó fǎn*).

When **heart and intent** (*xīn yì*) scatter, **true qi** flows from the **nine orifices** (*jiǔ qiào*), leaving the body depleted.

**Turbid qi** (*zhuó qì*) causes **women’s menstrual flow** (*yuè shuǐ*) to increase and **men’s nocturnal emissions** (*yè mèng*), where **yīn-qi** (*yīn qì*) **steals the Seven Treasures and Eight Jewels** (*qiè le qī zēn bā bǎo*), thus leading to **disease** (*jíbìng*).

**Question:** How does one **treat yīn-ghosts** (*yīn guǐ*)?
**Answer:** *"Use the **Sword and Chisel Method** (*Dāo guī zhī fǎ*)."*
**Question:** *"What is the **Sword and Chisel Method**?"*
**Formula:** *"The **Sword and Chisel** (*Dāo guī*) is **One** (*yī*). It contains **water** (*shuǐ*) and **qi** (*qì*), able to **generate all things** (*shēng wàn wù*).*
**Qi** is the **Chisel** (*guī*), forming **clouds and rain** (*yún shuǐ*), and **rain** (*yǔ*).

**Formula:** *"Expelling **qi** is the **Sword** (*dāo*), drawing in **qi** is the **Chisel** (*guī*). When **function** (*xíng gōng*) is applied, it becomes **all things** (*wàn yǒu*). The **verified adept** (*yàn zhě*) practices the **Sword and Chisel**—this is the **Method of Reversing Aging and Restoring Youth** (*fǎn lǎo huán tóng*)." The **Scripture** (*jīng*) says: *"Fire issues from below the body, water from above—water and fire are the remedies."*

**Formula:** *"**Lotus Sprouts piercing the knees** (*lú yá chuān xī shàngxià hé chē*), **installing the furnace** (*ān niè zào*) is the **Purple River Cart** (*zǐ hé chē*). **Moving semen to nourish the brain** (*bān jīng bǔ nǎo*) is the **Upper Cart** (*shàng chē*). When **fire is advanced**, **water grows warm**; when **water is advanced**, **fire grows cool**. Those who **dual-circulate water and fire** (*shuǐ huǒ shuāng xíng*) are practicing the **Gentle Lead Furnace** (*wēn wēn yīn dǐng*). When **qi enters the furnace**, **rest** (*xiū*) arises. **Following the Golden Sovereign** (*jīn gōng dài jiǔ*), **Dragon and Tiger** (*lóng hǔ*) **qi** circulates—**semen and blood** (*jīng xuè*) **scatter into the hundred meridians** (*bǎi mài*), **skin and flesh become moist** (*pí fū zī rùn*), and the **body shines** (*shēn tǐ guāng zé*). This is the **Method of Nourishment and Cultivation** (*xiū yǎng zhī fǎ*).

**Difficulty:** *"Why do the fat first wither?"* **Formula:** *"The fat are those who **cultivate externally but neglect internally** (*xiū wài bù xiū nèi*), whose **bones lack marrow** (*gǔ zhōng wú suǐ*). Their **Elisir Field** scatters **true qi**—thus they **wither and fall ill** (*jiù shuāi bìng*)." Those who **cultivate the Inner Dao** (*xiū nèi Dào*) are the **sprouts of eternal bliss and longevity** (*ān lè chángshēng zhī miáo*).

**Formula:** *"**Dragon Swirls around the Golden Furnace** (*lóng pán jīn dǐng*), **Tiger reaches the Elixir Field** (*hǔ dá dān tián*), the **Thunderbolt Coil** (*zhèn guà qǐ léi*) and the **Wind Coil** (*xùn guà qǐ fēng*)—when **function is applied**, **rinse the saliva** (*xǐ jīng*) in one great gulp, **swallow three times** (*fēn sān dù yàn*), and **press the qi downward in three cycles** (*àn qì xià xíng sān biàn*). **Dragon’s Brontes and Tiger’s Roars** (*lóng yīn hǔ xiào*) naturally arise.

This also **removes all abdominal diseases** (*chú fù zhōng wàn bìng*), and the sound is **like thunderbolts striking drums** (*ěr tīng zhī rú léi chuì huà gǔ*).

**Ascending** (*shàng*) is **elevation** (*shēng*), **descending** (*xià*) is **reduction** (*jiàng*). The **hymn** (*sòng*) says:
*"The subtle truth of **True Emptiness** (*zhēn kōng*) few know,
Sitting at **Curve River** (*Qū Jiāng*), watching swallows fly.
Thunder shakes the earth, ghosts and spirits tremble—
This is the **moment of yīn-yáng transformation** (*zhèngshì yīn yáng zào huà shí*)."*

Before **midday** (*wǔ shí*), **adjust fire and water** (*jiā jiǎn yòng shuǐ huǒ shēng jiān*), **Dragon and Tiger** follow the **Golden Sovereign** (*jīn gōng*), **drunk with wine** (*huáng pó zuì zhuài*). The **Yellow Grandmother** (*huáng pó*) **drags the King** (*dìng wáng*), asking: *"Who are you?"*

**Question:** *"The **Golden Sovereign** is **Deity** (*shén*), the **Yellow Grandmother** is **qi** (*qì*). **Yīn-qi** is the **infant** (*yīng ér*), **yáng-qi** is the **virgin** (*chī nǚ*)."*
**The Azure Dragon** (*qīng lóng*) is the **qi of the liver** (*gān zhī qì*), **The White Tiger** (*bái hǔ*) is the **qi of the lungs** (*fèi zhī qì*), **Kàn and Lí** (*kǎn lí*) are **semen and blood** (*jīng xuè*).

**Formula:** *"When **function** is applied, sit **like Mount Tài** (*rú Tàishān*), stand **like a Jewel Pagoda** (*rú bǎo tǎ*). **Secure the Four Gates** (*láo zhèn sì mén*), **knock firmly at the Mystic Pass** (*jǐn kòu xuán guān*). Rinse the **saliva** (*jīng*) in one gulp, **swallow it three times** (*wéi měng sān yàn xià*), **crossing the Kàn-Lí barrier** (*jiē qì guò lí gé*). **Activate it three times** (*huó zuò sān dù*), and naturally **Dragon and Tiger qi** will **move, rest, sit, or lie** (*xíng zhù zuò wò*), **closing the mouth and eyes** (*jìn kǒu bì mù*), **hearing no sound** (*ěr bù tīng shēng*), **seeing only inner landscapes** (*yǎn shì nèi jǐng*). **Fix the gaze upon the Elixir Field** (*yī rì zhèng guān dān tián*), **visualizing within the mind** (*yì zhōng xiǎng jiàn*), **following exhalation, qi descends** (*suí hū qì xià jiàng*), **following inhalation, qi ascends** (*suí xī qì shàng shēng*). It **does not cross the Kàn-Lí barrier** (*bù jiào lí gé*), nor **does it allow the qi to rush to the face** (*bù jiào zhù miàn mù shàng*). The **six qi** (*liù qì*) **each arrive** (*gè dào*), and at the **Middle Elixir Field** (*zhōng yuán*), they **meet** (*xiāng jiàn*).

**Pure qi** (*qīng qì*) **moves rightward** (*yòu xíng*), **turbid qi** (*zhuó qì*) **moves leftward** (*zuǒ xíng*). Each **circulates nine times** (*gè zhuǎn jiǔ zāo*), and **qi cannot exit upward or downward** (*qì shàng xià bù néng chū*), nor **can it scatter left or right** (*zuǒ yòu jié chéng niè zào*). This is called the **Dragon Swirls, Tiger Retreats Method** (*lóng pán hǔ yuǎn zhī fǎ*), and **qi naturally harmonizes** (*qì zìrán hé huì*).

Moreover, the **infant and virgin** (*yīng ér chī nǚ*) **pair as husband and wife** (*wéi fū fù zhī fǎ*), and **qi gathers at the spleen** (*pí shàng ān niè*)—this is the **Yellow Grandmother Matching Method** (*huáng pó pǐ qì zhī fǎ*). It is also called the **Heaven-Earth Intercourse Harmony Method** (*tiān dì jiāo tài zhī fǎ*), or the **Kàn-Lí Intercourse Method** (*kǎn lí jiāo gòu zhī fǎ*)—this is the **Method of Body Intercourse without Sexual Union** (*shēn jiāo shén bù jiāo zhī fǎ*).

**Deity does not engage in intercourse** (*shén bù jiāo*)—this is the **Method of Stillness and Clarity** (*qīng jìng zhī fǎ*), the **Thousand Circulations without Movement** (*qiān biàn bù yáo zhī fǎ*).

Yet, people today **mostly practice external Dao** (*duō xiū wài Dào*), not **internal Dao** (*nèi Dào*), and **see the Dao only in past teachings** (*jiàn Dào guòqù fǎ*).

**Cultivators** (*xiūxíng zhě*) may follow the **Three Great Teachings** (*sān jiào sān shēng*) on the **path**, but when they **advance three li**, they encounter **three great ravines** (*sān jiào sān shēng*) **without bottom** (*wú dǐ*). How then can they **cross**?

**Formula:** *"The **three great ravines** (*sān jiào sān shēng*) are the **Three Teachings and Three Vehicles** (*sān jiào sān shēng*), **awakening the Three Corpses** (*qǐ sān shī*), **establishing the Three Treasures** (*dìng sān bǎo*), **transcending the Three Realms** (*chuāo sān jiè*)."*

**Advancing another three li**, they see **six deep trenches** (*liù shēn gōu*), unable to **progress further** (*bù néng qián jìn*). What **gate** (*mén*) is this?

**Formula:** *"These are the **Six Perfections and Ten Thousand Practices** (*liù dù wàn xíng*), **Six Roots in Stillness** (*liù gēn qīng jìng*), **Severing the Six Bandits** (*zhǎn liù zéi*), **Restraining the Six Desires** (*jiè liù yù*), **Planting the Six Ladders** (*shù liù tī*)."*

**Advancing another three li**, they encounter **three ruined beams** (*sān chǎn fāng*). These are the **Treasure-Purification Beams** (*bǎo jìng fāng*), and when the **Seven Woods Corpses** (*qī lín shī*) **multiply**, this is the **Critical Moment of Application** (*lín zuò yòng*).

「Advancing another three li**, they see **one garden** (*yī zuò yuán*), named the **Garden of Discarded Fruits** (*shě guǒ yuán*). There is an **old man** (*yī wēng*) who gazes fixedly at the garden gate; those with **affinity** (*yǒu yuán*) pass through with **empty hands** (*kòng shǒu*).

**Advancing another three li** within the garden, they encounter **a great tree** upon which **a golden ox** (*jīn niú*) is struck and **fixed**. Beside the river, there are **five platforms** (*wǔ zuò tái*):

- the **Male’s Yellow Gold Platform** (*nán zǐ huáng jīn tái*)
- the **Female’s Phoenix Platform** (*nǚ zǐ fèng huáng tái*)
- the **Divine Fishermen’s Platform** (*shén xiān diào yú tái*)
- the **Eternal Peace, Thousand Flowers Platform** (*ān lè qiān huā tái*)
- the **Platform of the Impermanent Homeland** (*wú cháng wàng xiāng tái*).

At the river’s mouth, there are **three women** (*sān gè nǚ zǐ*), and the **ferry** (*dù kǒu*) is the **witch’s crossing** (*mó nǚ*).

When the **multitude fills the boat** (*zhòng shàn zhōu chuán*), they must **cross this river** (*guò cǐ hé*).

**Advancing another three li**, they see **a great mountain** (*yī zuò dà shān*), named **Mount Sumeru** (*xū mí shān*). Upon its slopes, there are **three rams**:

- a **green ram** (*qīng yáng*) on the eastern slope, which is **Laozi’s qi** (*lǎo jūn zhī qì*)
- a **white ram** (*bái yáng*) on the western slope, which is **the Master’s qi** (*fū zǐ zhī qì*)
- a **yellow ram** (*huáng yáng*) on the southern slope, which is **the Great Awakening Golden Immortal’s qi** (*dà jué jīn xiān zhī qì*).

The **three rams guide and escort** (*sān gè yáng ér yǐn jiē dà zhòng rù shān*) the multitude into the mountain, known as **Mount Three Yang Converging at the Cauldron** (*sān yáng jù dǐng shān*).

Within the mountain, there is **a walled city** (*yī zuò chéng*), named **Northern City** (*běi chéng*), with **four gates** (*sì mén*), each bearing a **plaque** (*pái*) inscribed with **characters** (*zì*):

- the **Gate of Radiant Brilliance** (*kāi guāng mén*) to the east
- the **Gate of Longevity** (*cháng shēng mén*) to the west
- the **Gate of Golden Radiance** (*jīn guāng mén*) to the south
- the **Gate of Great Sinking** (*dà lún mén*) to the north.

These correspond to the **four senses** (*sì mén*): **eye** (*yǎn*), **ear** (*ěr*), **nose** (*bí*), and **mouth** (*kǒu*).

Upon entering the **four gates**, they see **four caverns** (*sì zuò dòng fǔ*):

- the **Cavern of Celestial Music** (*tiān lè dòng*)
- the **Cavern of White Clouds** (*bái yún dòng*)
- the **Cavern of the Bamboo Grove** (*zhú guó dòng*)
- the **Cavern of Longevity** (*cháng shēng dòng*).

Within the **four caverns**, they encounter **four temples** (*sì zuò sì*):

- the **Temple of Non-Purity** (*wú jìng sì*)
- the **Temple of Mysterious Emptiness** (*xuán kōng sì*)
- the **Temple of the Bamboo Forest** (*zhú lín sì*).

**[Upon entering the four temples,]**, there are **four fruits** (*sì zuò guǒ*):

- the **Arhat of Tranquil Meditation** (*ān chán luó hàn*)
- the **Stream-Enterer** (*sī tuó*)
- the **Once-Returner** (*hán xū duō*)
- the **Non-Returner Arhat** (*wú guān rú hán luó hàn*), who serve as the **four temple masters** (*sì sì zhǔ*), these being the **four fruit Immortals** (*sì guǒ xiān rén*).

**Advancing further**, they see **five visions** (*wǔ guān*):

1. the **Vision of Merit and Fame** (*gōng míng guān*)
2. the **Vision of Medicine and Pharmacy** (*yī yào guān*)
3. the **Vision of Eternal Peace** (*ān yáng guān*)
4. the **Vision of True Suchness** (*zhēn rú guān*)
5. the **Vision of Tuóshuà** (*diào shuài guān*).

Within the **five visions**, there are **five palaces** (*wǔ guān zhōng yǒu wǔ gōng*):

- the **Palace of Twin Maidens** (*shuāng nǚ gōng*), which is the **eye**
- the **Palace of the Great Dragon** (*dà lóng gōng*), which is the **mouth**
- the **Palace of Upper Whiteness** (*shàng bái gōng*), which is the **nose**
- the **Palace of Crystal Waters** (*shuǐ jīng gōng*), which is the **ear**
- the **Palace of Celestial Scales** (*tiān chēng gōng*), which is the **mind** (*xīn*).

Inside sits **a grand pavilion** (*dà lóu gé*), with **twelve breaths** (*shàng xià shí èr hū xī*) above and below, named the **Twelve-Layered Pavilion** (*shí èr chóng lóu*).

There are also:
- the **Central Palace Pavilion** (*zhōng gōng lóu*)
- the **Moon Palace Pavilion** (*yuè gōng lóu*)
- the **Heavenly Immortal Pavilion** (*tiān xiān lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of Taking Treasures** (*qǔ bǎo lóu*)
- the **Holy Well Pavilion** (*shèng jǐng lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of Dao-Qi’s Wondrous Sound** (*fǎ qì miào yīn lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of Knowing the Dao** (*shí dào lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of Zen Summit** (*chán dǐng lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of Bright Resonance** (*jǐng yáng lóu*)
- the **Drum Tower Pavilion** (*zhōng gǔ lóu*)
- the **Pavilion of the Two Saints** (*èr shèng lóu*).

Each year on the **first day of the twelfth month** (*měi nián shí èr yuè yī rì*) at the **twelve earthly branches** (*shí èr shí*), the **human body contains the twelve monthly pavilions** (*shí èr yuè lóu*), where each pavilion corresponds to the **twelve zodiacal hours** (*shí èr jīng shí chén zhōng*).

Surrounding this are **nine palaces** (*sì miàn yòu jiàn jiǔ gōng*), which are the **nine orifices** (*jiǔ qiào*) of the human body. The **nine palaces of the orifices** (*jiǔ qiào gōng*) are as follows:

- to the east: the **Palace of Wind and Thunder** (*fēng léi gōng*) and the **Palace of Twin Groves** (*shuāng lín gōng*)
- to the south: the **Palace of Purple Micro** (*zǐ wēi gōng*) and the **Palace of the Arhat** (*mó ní gōng*)
- to the west: the **Palace of the Holy Mother** (*shèng mǔ guān*) and the **Palace of Benevolent Luo** (*huì luó gōng*)
- to the north: the **Palace of the Brahman** (*fàn gōng*) and the **Palace of Crystal Waters** (*shuǐ jīng gōng*)
- at the center: the **Palace of Tranquility** (*ān gōng*).

This is named the **Nine Palaces** (*jiǔ gōng*), akin to the **Nine Regions of Earth** (*dì liè jiǔ zhōu*).

Furthermore, the **Nine Palaces and the Central Palace** (*jiǔ gōng fǔ yuán gòng jì shí zhōu*) total **ten regions** (*shí zhōu*), which are the **Ten Lands** (*shí guó*):

- the **Land of the Jiao Ancestor** (*jiāo zǔ guó*)
- the **Land of the Arhat** (*mó ní guó*)
- the **Land of Blooming Flowers** (*kāi huā guó*)
- the **Land of the Strict Deer** (*lù yán guó*)
- the **Land of Golden Hue** (*jīn sè guó*)
- the **Land of the Glass Bead** (*liú lí guó*)
- the **Land of Śrāvastī** (*shě wèi guó*)
- the **Land of Southern Zen** (*nán chán guó*)
- the **Land of Heavenly India** (*tiān zhú guó*)
- the **Land of Repeated Yang** (*chóng yáng guó*).

These **Ten Lands** (*shí guó*) are the **Ten Stages of Bodhisattva Perfection** (*shí dì*), where each stage contains **a seat of Mount Tài** (*yī zuò Tài shān*).

What is the **body** (*shēn*)? It is the **source of great illness** (*zhì zhǒng dà bìng*), all of which **injure life** (*jiē shāng rén mìng*).

The body contains **four great seas** (*sì dà hǎi*):

- **saliva** (*jīn*) as the **Eastern Sea** (*dōng hǎi*)
- **blood** (*xuè*) as the **Southern Sea** (*nán hǎi*)
- **marrow** (*suǐ*) as the **Western Sea** (*xī hǎi*)
- **qi** (*qì*) as the **Northern Sea** (*běi hǎi*).

Additionally, there are **nine isles** (*jiǔ zhōu*), which are the **small intestine** (*xiǎo cháng*).

There are also **five lakes** (*wǔ hú*), where the **body is the Lake of the Moonlit Cavern** (*dòng tíng hú*):

- **essence** (*jīng*) as the **Lake of Jade** (*yù hú*)
- **sweet dew** (*gān lù*) as the **Lake of Clarified Butter** (*tí hú*)
- **mind** (*xīn*) as the **Lake of Mysterious Depth** (*xuán hú*)
- the **small intestine** (*xiǎo cháng*) as the **Lake of the River and Sea** (*jiāng hú*).

The **three luminaries** (*rì yuè xīng chén*) **wane** (*sān xiāo*), signifying the **decline of blood, qi, and essence** (*xuè qì jīng shuāi*).

This **waning** (*sān xiāo*) is like **mountains collapsing, seas drying up, and earth splitting** (*shān bēng hǎi jié dì liè*). Within the **twelve solar hours** (*yī rì shí èr shí chén zhōng*), one may **encounter the person of Mo** (*dé zuò Mò yuè qí rén*), achieving **fulfilled merit and perfect fruit** (*gōng chéng guǒ mǎn*). Males who **refine their form** (*liàn xíng*) become like **virgin boys** (*yīng nán*), and females become like **virgin girls** (*yīng nǚ*).

The scripture states: **"Form and spirit both wondrously refined**, harmonizing with the **True Dao** (*hé zhēn*), this is the **method of extracting the embryo and replacing the bones** (*chōu tāi huàn gǔ zhī fǎ*), the **true formula of inverted yin and yang, and the Five Phases** (*wú xíng*).

The **Five Phases** (*wǔ xíng*) include **metal** (*jīn*), **wood** (*mù*), **water** (*shuǐ*), **fire** (*huǒ*), and **earth** (*tǔ*).

- In **spring**, when **wood is vigorous** (*chūn mù wàng*), if **internal wood is not vigorous** (*nèi mù bù wàng*), people often **suffer from eye ailments** (*rén duō bìng yǎn jí*).
- In **summer**, when **fire is vigorous** (*xià huǒ wàng*), if **internal fire is not vigorous** (*nèi huǒ bù wàng*), people often **suffer from dysentery** (*rén duō xiè lì*).
- In **autumn**, when **metal is vigorous** (*qiū jīn wàng*), if **internal metal is not vigorous** (*nèi jīn bù wàng*), people often **suffer from coughing and wheezing** (*rén duō kě sǒu*).
- In **winter**, when **water is vigorous** (*dōng shuǐ wàng*), if **internal water is not vigorous** (*nèi shuǐ bù wàng*), people often **suffer from hernia** (*rén duō cuì qì*).
- The **spleen** (*pí*) is **earth** (*tǔ*), and its **four seasonal divisions** (*sì jì fèn*) are determined by the **yin and yang inversions and reversals** (*pí qì yīn yáng diān dào fǎn fù*) of the **spleen’s qi**.

The **Five Phases** (*wǔ xíng*) each **restrain one another** (*xiāng kè*), as follows:
- **metal restrains wood** (*jīn kè mù*)
- **wood restrains earth** (*mù kè tǔ*)
- **earth restrains water** (*tǔ kè shuǐ*)
- **water restrains fire** (*shuǐ kè huǒ*)
- **fire restrains metal** (*huǒ kè jīn*).

**Water and fire** (*shuǐ huǒ*) are the **yin and yang** (*yīn yáng*), and **one yin, one yang** (*yī yīn yī yáng*) is the **True Dao** (*zhēn dào*), which is **essence and blood** (*jīng xuè*).

When people **suffer from myriad illnesses** (*yǒu wàn bìng*), none are **related to the five viscera** (*jìn bù guān wǔ zàng zhī shì*), but all stem from **the depletion of their parents’ essence and blood** (*shǔn liǎo fù mǔ jīng xuè*). If the **elixir field weakens** (*dān tián ruò*), sickness and disease **will arise** (*biàn shēng bìng jí*); thus, **urgently gather spirit and stabilize nature** (*jí shōu shén dìng xìng*).

The *Scripture of the Nine Immortals* (*Jiǔ Xiān Jīng*) states: **"The Dao is one** (*dào zhě yī yě*). When a person **obtains the one** (*dé yī zhě*), all things **must be accomplished** (*wàn shì bì chéng*).

When **practicing the work** (*xíng gōng shí*), the **spirit and qi transform** (*shén qì zhuǎn*), and the **qi follows the intent** (*qì zhú yì xíng*). During **circulation** (*yùn shí*), **advance and surge forward** (*qián gǎn qián chōng*), becoming the **yin general of the yin spirit** (*yīn zuǒ jiāng yīn shén*). The **six heavenly stems** (*liù jiā*) **drive and turn** (*qū zhuǎn*), and the **six aspects, eight recognitions** (*liù xiàng bā shí*) **encircle the one true spirit** (*kuáng yī zhēn líng nèi*), **wandering through the nine palaces** (*yóu jiǔ gōng*), **observing and playing with the ten lands** (*kàn wán shí guó*), **descending to the longevity platform** (*cháng shēng jiàng tái*), and **making the infant boy and maiden’s elixir field a stable furnace** (*shǐ yīng ér zhǐ nǚ dān tián ān lú zào, jìn huǒ shāo yào*).

The **two lower orifices** communicate with the **kidney hall** (*shèn táng*), drawing the **treasure of the breath** (*bǎo*) with the exhalation—**thirty-six spits** into the mouth yield **snowflake** (*xuě huā*), swallowed into the **elixir field** (*dān tián*) as **snow**. Then, **upper merging and lower closing** (*shàng hé xià bì*) follow, as **Heaven and Earth unite** (*qián kūn xiāng hé*), filling with **true qi** (*zhēn qì*).

When the **spleen warms** (*pí nuǎn*), all maladies dissolve.
Like **firing clay in a kiln**, it naturally completes when its time comes.
Like a **hen brooding an egg**, or a **woman bearing child**, time is not reckoned—only when the body aches is it the **iron-black ox hauling the cart** (*tiě hēi niú bān chē*), the **true unity of qi and nature** (*zhēn yī qì, zhēn yī xìng*).
The **black** is the **lower qi** (*xià qì*); **painful qi** exits through **defecation**, **swollen qi** through **urination**.

There is also the **method of descending the Heavenly Pass and Earthly Axis** (*tiān guān dì zhóu*): gazing at the **item solar pass** (*xiàng yáng guān*) and **muddy homunculus palace** (*ní huán gōng*), drawing **true qi** long into the nose and mouth, **forcefully exhaling six times**—the **Heavenly Pass and Earthly Axis** remain motionless as death. Those who daily practice in the **palace** (*xíng gōng*) perpetually harmonize **yin and yang**.

At the **winter solstice**, **one yang is born**; at the **summer solstice**, **one yin is born**.
The **winter solstice** begins at the **child hour** (*zǐ shí*), watching the **eastward sunrise** as **yang**; the **summer solstice** begins at **noon** (*wǔ shí*), with **sunset** as **yin**.
This is the **principle of yin and yang returning and reversing**.

When **earth-qi ascends** and **heavenly rain descends**, **three days of wind**, **ten mornings of rain**—if **wind and rain follow their season**, the people thrive, and so does one’s body: **enduring joy, free of illness**.

If a person has **ten thousand maladies**, each disease is cured by its **corresponding true practice** (*zhēn gōng*), naturally responding.

The **first great method of refining the Nine-Turn Elixir** (*jiǔ zhuàn huán dān*) includes:
- The **method of the yellow sprout piercing the knee** (*huáng yá chuān xī*)
- The **method of shooting the nine-layered iron drum** (*shè jiǔ céng tiě gǔ*)
- The **method of the crown prince wandering the four gates** (*tài zǐ yóu sì mén*)
- The **method of the golden rod pointing at the wheel** (*jīn biān zhǐ lún*)
- The **method of the reed sprout piercing the knee** (*lú yá chuān xī*)
- The **method of Xuanyuan straddling fire** (*xuān yuán kuà huǒ*)
- The **method of the jade maiden caressing the body** (*yù nǚ mō shēn*)
- The **method of Zhongli bearing the sword on his back** (*zhōng lí bèi jiàn*)
- The **method of Lu the Old Man fishing** (*lǚ wēng diào yú*)
- The **method of Chen Xiqi’s great sleep** (*chén xī qí dà shuì*)

All these are **practices of the Three Teachings**, each treating diseases.

Those who can **transcend birth**—when a person practices this method, **true qi nurtures heat in the elixir field**, and at night, they often dream of **herding cattle on mountains**: the **cattle**—whether **red oxen**, **green oxen**, or **immortals, Daoists**, **palaces, temples**, **great roads, fine houses, high carriages, good trees**—or seeing **children and officials**—all signify **vigorous elixir-field qi**.

If one dreams of **wild thorns, evil men, broken houses, collapsing pagodas, tombs, fallen trees, or river crossings**, it means the **elixir-field qi is weak**—supplementation is needed.

**Secret Key** (*jué*):
*"Seal the lips of these three—speak not of them.*
*The six ears fear leaking the Daoist secrets."*

**Secret Key**:
These three are:
1. The **disrespectful husband** (*bù xiào zhī rén*)
2. The **unfaithful husband** (*bù jìng xìn zhī rén*)
3. The **husband who does not transmit the precepts well** (*bù chuán jiè bù shàn zhī rén*).

Do not speak of this key. **Excluding these**, men, women, monks, Daoists, officials—**all may receive the law and precepts**.

Those who perfect this **true secret key** are worth **gold from Mount Sumeru** (*xū mí jīn*).
Taking all scriptures as **ancestors**, those who seek **ease** practice **small vehicle** (*xiǎo chéng*) methods.
Though small, they are the **roots of the great vehicle** (*dà chéng*).

The **Cause-and-Effect Scripture** states that **eight fields of merit** exist in cultivation, and the **field of saving suffering and healing illness** is the **first in saving life**—stronger than **burning incense in southern temples** or **offering supplies in northern halls**.

Saving one life is like **building a seven-tiered gemstone stupa**.
If men or women obtain this key, **do not transmit it recklessly**—to do so lightly **leaks the immortals’ secrets**, causing the **nine ancestors to fall into ruin**, eternally confined to **Yingdu**, never reborn in human form.
**Beware! Take heed! Believe, receive, and practice faithfully.**

The **Golden Pass, Jade Lock Secret Key** of **True Yang Master** is complete.
