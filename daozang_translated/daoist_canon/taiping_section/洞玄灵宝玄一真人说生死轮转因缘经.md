At that time, on the twentieth day of the first month of the first year of Jingyuan, the immortal Yun Du ascended the Jade Chamber of the Golden Terrace of Kunlun to inquire of the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, the Perfected One of Mysterious Unity, saying:

"Though I, in my lowly station, have undeservedly received the imperial grace and accumulated study for over two thousand eight hundred years—able to ride clouds and mount dragons in carefree roaming through the great void—I have yet to attain the office of ascending heaven. The affairs of yin and yang, the causes of coming and going, lie beyond my concern, and their principles remain unknown to me.

Recently, I have been unable to discern the causes and conditions of human life and death: whether as father, mother, elder brother, or younger brother; as sisters or household members—do they meet again in every generation, or are there distinctions? Do they each follow their virtue and power, so that those of former lives are reborn in later ones, or not? How great or small are their transgressions and blessings? Are they light or heavy? What forms do they fully receive? How do their paths differ? By what causes do masters and friends meet?

I wish for you to distinguish these matters and expound what I have not yet heard."

The Perfected One replied: "Your questions are subtle and profound. The matters of coming and going are such that even you have not yet heard of them. The turning of the kalpa is complete, and these affairs cannot remain hidden. Now I shall speak of them to you—guard them as secrets and uphold them.

The Dao is eternally One, without limit or end. It was revered by the ancient heavens and is honored by the heavens today. It is One without duality, yet the various heavens and humans speak in different tongues and name it differently. Its great return is to the One. The master, too, is One, but with the changes of the world, they emerge to transform it, shaping the myriad things.

Those of former lives revolve within the Great Yin, and later, each is reborn according to their merit—these are the people of the present world. When heaven and earth close, humans perish with the turning of the kalpa; when heaven and earth open, humans are born with its turning. The sun, moon, and stars likewise revolve with the kalpa. Thus, the causes and conditions are unbroken. Heaven and earth, humans, the sun, moon, and stars do not repeat themselves but instead give rise to one another in endless succession.

Fathers, mothers, wives, children, brothers, and sisters are not constant gatherings. Each follows their fortune and virtue, temporarily lodging in the wombs of their parents. Later, they again disperse and part according to their merit, their revolutions without constancy. One who was a father in a former life may be reborn as a descendant; one who was a brother may become a father in a later life. They revolve in coming and going, dying and being reborn again.

The master, however, transmits the generations without end and is eternally the master. Thus, the master is my father and mother, the eternal artisan of life. Fathers, mothers, and brothers are not inherently kin; they merely follow their fortune and virtue to lodge and be born, with parents raising them to maturity. Therefore, the sages established the law of filial piety to repay the grace of nurturing and to cultivate a heart of devotion. Those who are unfilial and disobedient are punished by the king’s law, and heaven also strikes them down.

Brothers, temporarily born together of the same parents, should cherish one another and together cultivate a heart of devotion. When parents pass away and the rites of burial are completed, this repays the grace of their nurturing. The sacrifices of the four seasons serve as the law of compassion and devotion, passed down to later generations so they may know the grace of filial nurturing.

Husbands and wives rarely serve one another for long; their bonds of love are easily broken. A wife abandons her parents’ surname to take her husband’s. Before marriage, her fate is tied to her parents; after marriage, it is bound to her husband. If her husband dies, her fate is tied to her son. If the wife dies and the husband lives, the household remains intact. If the husband dies and the wife remarries, the bloodline is severed. Thus, sons belong to their father’s surname, while daughters belong to their mother’s birth—nameless and without surname.

Human life in the world is like the blossoms of spring grass: birth has no fixed day, but death has its destined portion. While alive, they temporarily share a household; in death, each follows their causes and conditions to return to their destined realm, never to meet again. Those with fortune are reborn in heaven or in the gates of noble families and kings. Those with transgressions are bound to the long night, their paths like endless exile and punishment.

Only during the four seasons and the five *la* festivals may they gather and meet again, rejoicing and recalling the love of their time alive. Yet after parting, each returns to their own realm, forever separated, never to remember one another again. When their ghostly merit is exhausted, they follow the weight of their exile, each according to their causes and conditions—some reborn as humans, others falling into the five paths or the six kinds of livestock, or among the border barbarians. The bonds of former days vanish into darkness, and kinship is no more.

When humans have descendants, the rites of yin and yang gather joy between heaven and earth. In death, their essence and spirit remain in heaven, but if they face exile and punishment, the principle of yin and yang’s mutual generation no longer applies. Thus, in life, one is human; in death, one is a ghost. Between life and death, only the name changes.

Life is joy; death is suffering. Therefore, the living cannot know the affairs of the ghosts below, while the dead, as ghosts, know the affairs of those above. All ghosts delight in life, yet they cannot act on their own. When their transgressions are exhausted, the lighter ones may return to be reborn among humans, again lodging in the womb according to the measure of their merit.

Those who do evil in life die as ghosts, forever unable to seek rebirth. Instead, they fill the ranks of the long-bound, suffering cold and misery without end. When their transgressions are exhausted, they take the forms of the six kinds of livestock, or the tribes of the border barbarians, or are born with the six afflictions—blindness, deafness, madness, or idiocy—becoming foul and repulsive men and women, utterly despised. They endure hunger and cold, freezing and starving to death. After their suffering, they are reborn among the six kinds of livestock, with no hope of escape. Some are born as slaves or lowly people, driven and feared by others, constantly suffering hunger and cold, their bodies bearing the lash. They watch others rise and bow, their lives and deaths at the mercy of others."

At that time, the soul no longer knows from whence it came to be reborn—only the spirits of the dead may discern it. If one’s life held good deeds, in death one becomes a lord of ghosts, dwelling in halls of joy, where heaven provides food from its kitchens. Free and at ease, one awaits the end of one’s merits, then enters the gates of heavenly kings or is born into a family of wealth and nobility. Wealth and emolument arise naturally, desires are fulfilled, and one meets with the good. Ever abiding in a sagely age, one forms bonds with the worthy, and the path of fortune grows day by day. When the body’s life ends, one ascends directly to the heavens.

If one has made offerings to the Three Treasures and yearns in heart for immortality, immortals will surely descend to teach the Way of ascending to heaven in broad daylight. If one merely cultivates ordinary good deeds without passing through the Earth Bureau of Mount Tai, seven generations of ancestors will rejoice together. The matters of life and death are as clear as the sun and moon, yet only the wise perceive them while the foolish remain blind. Examine closely and ponder deeply, and understanding will naturally dawn.

Abandon evil thoughts and take goodness as your calling. In the hidden depths of heaven and earth, deeds and transgressions escape not the slightest reckoning—every hair is recorded, nothing is lost or overlooked.

The Perfected One said: In the life and death of all people, as in the earliest ages, all depends upon the heart. At the gates of the Heavenly Emperor, names are reviewed and decrees issued: those fated to die have their living names erased and replaced with ghostly ones; those fated to be reborn in the world have their ghostly names erased and living ones restored. Then, according to the weight of their merit and virtue, the light are born into poor and lowly families, entering a world of suffering, enduring all six extremes until death. Cold and misery drag them on, selling themselves to feed their mouths, never full, their clothing never covering their bodies. They bear the form of humans but lack human blessings and rewards. The heavy in merit are born into noble and prosperous families, or into wealth and emolument that come unbidden, aligning with all that is good. Clothing and food arise naturally, without toil, and they constantly meet with the good and worthy, forming bonds with sages.

In this later age, the transmission has waned, and the qi of destiny nears its end. Human life holds no fixed span; heaven selects the body, and each person has a spirit that governs life and another that governs death dwelling within. Those who cherish life are protected by the life spirit; those who court death are assailed by the death spirit. Those who cherish life are inscribed in the register of life; those who court death are inscribed in the register of death. All is bound by clear covenants, yet people remain unaware.

Those who accumulate goodness in life meet with sages and have their names entered in the left contract. In life, they become rulers of men; in death, guests of the heavenly halls. Seven generations of ancestors rejoice together, and later births may be as sons of kings and lords, or they may be born wise and sagely, becoming teachers of gods and men, revered by all within the four seas. When their merit is complete, they ascend to immortality in broad daylight. Thus, if merit and virtue are never severed, one generation after generation forms bonds with the worthy and sagely. Such towering merit has no equal.

Those who do evil in life align with the wicked, their names entered in the right contract of the register of death. In life, they remain distant from the good, their gatherings unstable, and they never receive the blessings of fortune. In death, they enter the hells and the realm of hungry ghosts, their seven generations of ancestors drawn along with them into the endless dark night, with no hope of escape. Such is the difference between good and evil—how vast it is!

Those who do good in life are chosen by heaven to have good people born as their descendants, so that parents receive their grace and fortune, all as recompense for good deeds. Those who do evil in life are chosen by heaven to have wicked and rebellious descendants born into their families, doomed from birth, growing to become disobedient and unfilial. Some engage in licentiousness, theft, banditry, or murder, constantly bringing their parents great sorrow. For lighter offenses, they are enslaved; for heavier ones, their lives are forfeit. Or they may live in poverty and cold, with no security from morning to night, serving others, constantly suffering hunger and cold, their clothing never covering their bodies, the lash never leaving their flesh. They know not the causes of their past, or they may be born deaf, mute, blind, or crippled, dying in infancy or at three or ten years old, or just as they near adulthood. Some are killed by people or poisonous beasts, or are endlessly imprisoned, causing their parents to grieve and sigh as they go about their days. Or they may bear many daughters and no sons, living to old age in loneliness and hardship. All this is the recompense for past evil deeds, as parents and children are bound together in mutual retribution. The principle is clear and cannot be violated; those who violate it find no pardon.

The Perfected One having expounded the causes and conditions of life, death, and rebirth, now chants the verses on the good karma of future lives:

The Great Dao’s essence is originally none,
The two qi deep and obscure.
Yin and yang harmonize the three powers,
Heaven and earth set their mechanisms in motion.
Life and death follow the turning of destiny,
Sin and fortune cling to none unfairly.
Accumulate fortune and plant good deeds,
And good people will come to be born.
Fortunate bonds and goodness converge,
In coming and going, the body receives glory.
Born to be a lord of the age,
Or a master of gods and men.
When life ends, a guest of the heavenly halls,
Fortune and emolument ever follow.
Riding dragons and reining red phoenixes,
Wandering carefree in the Upper Clarity.
Or becoming a sage-king,
Enfeoffed and ruling the ten heavens.
Seven generations rejoice together,
In the Southern Palace, reborn anew.
Forever severed from evil bonds,
Generation after generation, ever radiant.

The Perfected One further chants the verses on the evil karma of future lives:

Though heaven and earth are not none,
They may be expected to give birth in turn.
Living in the world without thought of goodness,
One’s sins heavily accumulate.
In death, suffering in the mire and ashes,
Wind and fire never leave the form.
When the sins are exhausted, one is reborn as a human,
Ever dwelling in cold and lowly gates.
Gripped by illness and heavy afflictions,
Deaf, blind, mad, and deranged.
Sin and rebellion naturally converge,
All evils never leave the body.
Bound in form by whips and cudgels,
Ghostly sicknesses never cease for a year.
Parents sigh endlessly,
Born and dying in the hells.
Sinking into the dark evil paths,
Hoping for goodness, forever without cause.

The Perfected One said: The Dao returns to goodness as water flows to the abyss. The difficulty of transforming the wicked is like the treetop of a tall tree, lacking the source of good earth. Though they hear the good Dao and know it in the moment, they turn away and forget, like rain falling on a high forest—though momentarily moistened, it dries at once.

The good person who hears the Dao is like the abyss of a great river or the source of the vast sea—only receiving, never rejecting. The teachings of the Dao are rarely heard, sages are seldom encountered, and the worthy are difficult to meet. Unless the cycles of heaven and earth align and their movements converge, the scriptures of the Dao will not emerge, and sages will not appear. When the emperor rules with the Dao, sages are born in the land; when the great cycle converges, the appointed time draws near.

As the celestial movement hastens toward the final age, at the winter solstice of the new moon, in the era of the House of Jin, the scriptures of the Dao will at last become clear. For a brief time, there shall be great peace, and for several decades, one in five among the people will understand the Dao. When the age of the Golden Horse draws to its end and the celestial cycle shifts to the Zhou, in the year of the Water Dragon, Lord Li shall arise to govern. In that sagely era, the distinctions between good and evil in life and death will become clear. The virtuous among men and women shall turn to perform good deeds.

At that time, a sage shall appear in the world to deliver sentient beings. Those who encounter him shall receive the karmic retribution of past deeds—some shall attain liberation in this very life, while others shall rejoice as entire households enter into blessedness. But the wicked, ever at odds with goodness, upon hearing the sage’s teachings, shall dismiss them as nothing. These are not the roots of good people; heaven seals their hearts, preventing them from harmonizing with the sage. Thus, the streams of good and evil diverge, forever separated by heaven and earth.

When the cycles converge and the Dao and virtue flourish, fools shall be many, while those who understand the Dao shall be few—one in ten thousand, and even that is considered abundant. Each shall teach and transform, yet none shall seek the original source. At that time, there shall be cunning and deceitful individuals, wavering in doubt, disbelieving the great Dharma, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood. As the appointed time nears its convergence, heaven ordains it to be so.

Men and women of sincere heart, if you are good, do not retreat, for retreat means loss. Once the merit of former deeds is lost, a worthy one shall not appear again for ten thousand kalpas. When a worthy one appears in the world, it is difficult to serve them properly. Some may feign foolishness or deafness, some may be pure or turbid, some upright or chaste, some hidden or revealed, some right or wrong, some may spurn the shallow among gods and humans, while others may favor one thing over another. At the outset of their arrival, evil shall manifest in strange ways. But if it is a true sage, their conduct shall remain unshaken. Though they undergo myriad transformations, their essence shall remain eternally pure, distinct from the ordinary, untainted by common customs.

Once you have encountered them, fear that you may not have the chance to serve them again. They may withdraw in concealment, depart from the land, or leave no trace behind. If you oppose them, you shall be forever separated for ten thousand kalpas. But if you form a karmic bond with the worthy one, you shall sit and enjoy blessings, your seven ancestors shall ascend to heaven, and after death, you shall rise to the celestial halls, where clothing and sustenance come naturally. All this arises from karmic connections in past lives, ordained by the Dao.

Those without such connections, though they dwell beneath the eaves of the worthy one or sit beside them, shall never form a bond, for it cannot be forced. The distinctions between sin and fortune are precise, not a hair’s breadth in error. Even if they chance to meet, they may suffer manifold calamities, preventing the convergence of good fortune. This is all due to the lack of karmic affinity in past lives; heaven confounds their minds, ghosts seal their intentions, preventing them from joining with goodness. Thus, they remain forever apart, drifting ever farther from virtue.

If one desires goodness and, upon encountering harm, does not retreat in heart, fortune shall surely come. Having spoken thus, the teachings are now transmitted to the worthy. Let them not be leaked, for they accord with the scriptural methods. Only after the oath is sworn shall they be passed on.

Here ends *The Scripture of the Wheel of Life and Death: Causes and Conditions*, as Spoken by the Perfected One of Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, the True One of the Primordial Unity.
