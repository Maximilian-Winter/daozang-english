### *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Clarity and Radiance: The Central Yellow and Eight Pillars*

#### **Chapter One: The Dao of the Central Yellow**
At birth, humans receive correctness and are entrusted with harmony to live.
They contain the qi of pure unity and preserve the primordial perfection of the original.
When yin and yang harmonize, illness and affliction do not arise.
When the bodily form is firm, the cinnabar elixir’s origin may be guarded.
Not depleting the original qi, one attains great wholeness.

Thus, the Dao of the Central Yellow takes correctness as its root.
Those who know the root neither deviate nor incline, neither stray nor lean.
They govern above and below, grasp the four directions, and comprehend both *where* and *how* it abides.
Knowing *where* it abides, they do not lose their orientation.
Comprehending *how* it abides, they do not forsake their contemplation.
Discerning orientation and knowing contemplation—this is called the correct Dao.

Those deeply versed in the Dao can achieve this; those not deeply versed forget the root and pursue the branches, failing to return to the central correctness, and thus the Dao of the Central Yellow is lost.

"Central" denotes its position; "yellow" denotes its color.
Knowing the position without losing it, recognizing the color without fixation.
Neither position nor color—attaining what is to be attained.

Now, the qi of the Yellow Heaven spans the chest and diaphragm, illuminating its original truth, neither deluded nor erring—this is called *trust*.
What is *utmost trust*? Trust resides within it, in the Palace of the Yellow Bell.
Where the central qi manifests, the harvests of the year are abundant.
Humans who live thus may guard the One.
Having cultivated guarding the One, the Eight Pillars are established.
The Eight Pillars established, the golden elixir blazes resplendent.
After three thousand merits are perfected, one steps into the void and ascends the earth.

#### **Chapter Two: The Splendor of the Yellow Court**
When the primordial chaos splits open, the principles of the divine continent become clear.
When the bodily form is born, the functions of the five organs become manifest.
Heaven and Earth stand; Qian and Kun are completed.
Like the construction of a beehive or the formation of an anthill’s mound,
Beyond Qian and Kun, there are also Qian and Kun.
Within the Six Directions, are there not also Six Directions?

Only the principles of Qian and Kun, the meanings of the Six Directions—
Seek them within the body, and within this single body, Heaven and Earth are already positioned.
Thus, the Azure Flower Capital is the true palace of the liver.
The Crimson Brilliance Mansion is the true chamber of the heart.
The Luminous White Splendor is the true position of the lungs.
The Mysterious Black Prefecture is the true tower of the kidneys.
The spleen resides at the center, named the Yellow Court.

Its house is of gold, its gates of jade.
The jade gates gleam like valleys, their color like steamed millet.
There is a true person, clad in golden-threaded robes,
Seated like a child upon a golden lotus, named *Rui Zhu* ("Jewel Bud"), styled *Yao Xian* ("Jade Immortal").
Those who recognize his face may be made coeval with Heaven.
Guarding his palace and chambers, contemplating him always—thus one enters the profound mystery.

#### **Chapter Three: The Four Hollows Emptied**
The eyes are the hollow of spirit-light.
The ears are the hollow of harmonious sound.
The mouth is the hollow of numinous springs.
The nose is the hollow of true fragrance.

Those who know the Dao of the Central Yellow ensure that:
The eyes see nothing improper, and spirit-light shines brightly;
The ears hear nothing improper, and harmonious sounds resonate deeply;
The mouth consumes no reckless food, and the numinous spring remains clear;
The nose smells no reckless scents, and true fragrance is naturally fragrant.

When evil desires do not arise, the correct qi is luminous—
This luminous correct qi is called *emptiness and tranquility*.
Emptiness and tranquility are like a bellows:
They may ascend or descend, and the correct qi intermingles without obstruction within.
The central gate is vast and boundless, open and expansive.
Not flowing into recklessness—this is true action.
Since it is called *true*, one may attain the Dao.
The Dao is not sought elsewhere; it originally resides within one’s own body.
The Four Hollows not emptied—this is why the Dao is lost.
Emptiness as function, the central gate harmoniously merged.
Light illumines inwardly, emerging in perfect stability.

Like a great chamber with four high, bright windows,
Dwelling within it, one may be called *clear and bright*.
Thus, rectifying the Central Yellow—the Central Yellow is the Four Hollows emptied.

#### **Chapter Four: The Two Portals Sealed**
The Two Portals are the gateways through which qi and essence leak.
That humans die young or age prematurely is because:
The front portal injures essence, the rear portal injures qi.
Essence injured and not secure leads to reckless indulgence—this is called the *flooding portal*.
Qi lost and easily depleted leads to reckless dissipation—this is called the *thieving portal*.

Those who skillfully nurture essence and qi:
Essence arises from thought—thought originates in the spleen; thus, cut off thought.
Qi arises from food—food originates in the spleen; thus, cut off food.
Cutting off thought, true essence is internally secure, not swayed by lust.
Cutting off food, true qi is internally whole, not scattered by fine flavors.

Comprehending the correct principles of the Two Portals, the Central Field is secure and nourished.
The Central Field secure—this is the means to longevity.
Thus, rectifying the Central Yellow necessarily seals the Two Portals.

#### **Chapter Five: The Two Caverns Opened**
The Two Caverns are the true positions of the spirit palace,
The root-source of immortal medicines, the pathways of qi and fluids.
The crown is the Cavern of Heavenly Numen—opening it makes it the gateway for qi’s entry and exit.
The upper palate is the Cavern of Jade Spirit—opening it makes it the key to the entry and exit of essence-fluid.

Those who master the Central Yellow:
Having emptied the Four Hollows, external perversities do not invade.
Having sealed the Two Portals, internal correctness does not dissipate—thus, no thought and fasting.
Raising qi upward, auspicious clouds enter and exit through the gate of Heavenly Numen—one may fly the spirit.
Drawing fluid to rinse and swallow, numinous liquid flows from the spring of Jade Spirit—one may irrigate the elixir fields.

**Golden Crucible Here, Auspicious Grain Takes Root**
Here the Golden Crucible stands, and fine grain plants its goodness.
Attaining the Central Yellow’s method for opening the caverns—only then is one named among the Great Array of Immortals.
To grasp its essentials, to know its essentials, is the root of attaining the Dao.

**Erecting the Eight Pillars, Chapter Six**
The body is the dwelling of the spirit.
Spoken of in terms of form, it is called the “brow-and-forehead abode.”
Spoken of in terms of qi, it is called the “qi abode.”
Spoken of in terms of nature, it is called the “abode of Supreme Stability.”
Thus, the body is the dwelling where the spirit resides.
For the spirit’s dwelling to endure, nothing surpasses erecting pillars.
Pillars are the masters of a house.
Primordial qi is the foundation stone.
With primordial qi as the foundation, the Eight Pillars stand.

What are the Eight Pillars?
Emptying the Four Hollows is called the “Pillars of Fivefold Clarity.”
Sealing the Two Portals is called the “Two Poles.”
Opening the Two Caverns is called the “Supporting Beams.”
With primordial qi as the base and spirit-essence as the roof, one may then dwell within.
To settle one’s nature, to preserve one’s Dao.
The Dao is vast, without limit.
Neither sinking nor floating, attaining one’s dwelling, knowing one’s arising.
Knowing one’s stability, fitting one’s ease, rectifying one’s rectitude—thus the Way of Guest and Host is established.
The Guest is like lead and mercury; the Host is like heart and kidneys.
When heart and kidneys are rectified, lead and mercury are born—only then can one stabilize the Golden Crucible and perform the Great Simmering.

Thus, the adept takes the body as a secure dwelling and sees, hears, feels, and knows as wind and rain.
Erecting the Eight Pillars, stabilizing the walls—then the harm of wind and rain vanishes.
Therefore, first recognize the Dao, next clarify its signs.
Establish the foundation, fix the directions—like a king building a state.
Facing south, back to the north, responding to clarity and governing—this is the Dao.

**Rectifying Position, Chapter Seven**
The Dao accords with the true center.
Attaining the Dao of the true center, one is simply open and clear.
What is “open and clear”? Like choosing a dwelling:
Each settles in its place, fitting front hall and rear chamber.
Each suits its position—Green Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right, Vermilion Bird in front, Dark Warrior behind—each guards its direction.
Thereupon, arrange the Eight Trigrams, fix the Three Fields, know ascent and descent, examine the seasonal nodes, and clarify the natural.
Yet I, though not enlightened, am enlightened by enlightenment itself.
Though I do not defile, defilement brings no clarity.
Clarity is supreme—supreme clarity is undefiled.
Defiled things cannot attain it; defilement comes from it.
Recognize the true fruit, preserve the true and authentic, transcend the true path, emerge on the true way.
Supremely harmonious, perfectly round, serene and unmoving.
This is called the root of rectifying position, the place of recognizing the crucible.
Having recognized the crucible’s place, the Returned Elixir may be obtained.

**Rectifying Nature, Chapter Eight**
There is true nature, there is deluded nature—nature is fundamentally one.
Never were there two; guard the one, cast off the two, and attain true nature.
When nature is true, it does not lose its rectitude.
Rectified yet not rigid—what need is there for rectification?
Rectitude is rectitude.
Rectifying what is not rectified, the unrectified becomes rectified.
Following what is rectified, uniting with the true and authentic—this is called true nature.
Nature is naturally tranquil and harmonious; through harmony it communicates.
Through communication it penetrates; through penetration it is clear.
The clarity of clear nature—this is called true nature.

**Profound Embrace, Chapter Nine**
The Central Yellow is not established by intention—only through profound embrace is it known.
The Central Yellow’s Eight Pillars are not the product of refined thought—only through the Central Yellow do the Eight Pillars exist.
Pillars stand and the dwelling is complete; the foundation is firm and the pillars are stable.
Extending profound embrace, the principle of Heaven and Earth is attained.
The principle of Heaven and Earth attained, one stands in the true center.
Thus, without knowing the Central Yellow, one cannot speak of being human.
The fat or leanness of a single meal—this too is the Central Yellow.
The cutting off of a single entanglement of right and wrong—this too is the Central Yellow.
Knowing the Central Yellow, the Great Dao is manifest.
