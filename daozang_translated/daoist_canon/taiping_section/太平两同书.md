### *The Scripture of Supreme Peace and Dual Concord, Scroll One*

#### 1. On Nobility and Baseness
All things are transformed by a single *qi*: yang is exalted, yin is humble. The Three Powers take form—heaven is high, earth is low. The tortoise and dragon lead the scaled creatures; the qilin and phoenix stand as lords of the feathered and furred. Gold and jade are the finest of stones; lingzhi and pine are the finest of plants. Such is the principle of nobility and baseness, manifest in nature itself.

The tortoise and dragon differ in divine efficacy; the qilin and phoenix vary in benevolence. Gold and jade possess rare brilliance and luster; lingzhi and pine bear steadfast elegance. All are endowed with distinct natures, revered by the multitude.

Yet among the ten thousand things, only man is noble. If man does not govern himself, he must defer to another—thus the sage of luminous talent rises above the multitudes. Those deemed worthy by their age are ennobled as rulers; those unfit for their time are debased as common folk.

Yet to occupy the ruler’s station is not in itself nobility. Though one may wield power in abundance, without virtue to commend it, such nobility is no true nobility. To dwell among the common folk is not in itself baseness. Though one may lack wealth and strength, if the Dao may be gleaned from them, such baseness is no true baseness.

How can this be said? Of old, King Zhou of Yin sat upon the Nine-Five throne, while Confucius was but an exiled minister of Lu. Duke Jing of Qi possessed a thousand chariots, yet Boyi starved on Mount Shouyang. Were these not distinctions of rank, divisions of fate? Yet for a hundred generations, rulers have vied to emulate the righteousness of Confucius and Boyi, while even children blush to hear the names of Zhou and Jing. Thus the path of nobility and baseness cannot be measured by success or failure.

The lord of men is called exalted because he possesses virtue. Without virtue, how does he differ from the ten thousand things? Therefore, the enlightened ruler turns the wheel of state with care, rises at dawn and retires late, toils without weariness, and heeds counsel amid the eight sounds—all for good reason.

When the Yellow Emperor sought the recluse of Kongtong, the winds aligned in his favor. When Emperor Yao deferred to the hermit of Ying River, timely rains followed. Even the solitary integrity of a widower’s virtue humbled the Son of Heaven—how much more should the emperor, who bears the weight of all beneath heaven, fear the scorn of the people?

One should not fret over lack of rank but over the failure to cultivate virtue; not over baseness but over the shallowness of the Dao. The *Book of Changes* says: "The great treasure of the sage is called *position*. How does one preserve it? Through *ren*." Without *ren*, how can one preserve it?

Thus the rulers of antiquity toiled from dawn to dusk—not for empty fame, but lest they lose the sage’s great treasure and disgrace the legacy of former kings. Nobility is honor, yet without the Dao, one cannot hold it. Baseness is shame, yet even with strength, one cannot escape it.

If one cultivates virtue without seeking nobility, nobility will seek them. If one clings to unkindness while wishing to escape baseness, baseness will not depart. Of old, Yu Shun dwelt in obscurity—was he not lowly? Yet the sacred cauldron was cast in his name, and he achieved the grace of abdication. Jie of Xia wielded the divine regalia—was he not mighty? Yet none among the people aided him, and he met the disgrace of exile.

Gu Gong fled baseness and resettled—did he seek nobility? Before his deeds bore fruit, a city arose at the foot of Mount Qi. Hu Hai mocked the simplicity of Yao and Yu—did he delight in baseness? Yet death came swiftly, and his land was divided at Bashang.

Yu Shun’s lowliness brought no material gain to please the masses; Jie’s might lacked no spears to repel foes. Gu Gong’s rise was not by his own strength alone; Hu Hai’s fall was not by his will as lord of ten thousand chariots. The noble grow baser, the base grow nobler—those who seek it do not obtain it; those who obtain it do not seek it. Does Heaven show partiality? It only blesses virtue.

Thus Laozi said: "The Dao is exalted, virtue is noble." Is this not what it means?

#### 2. On Strength and Weakness
Strength does not arise from itself but relies on weakness to sustain it. Weakness does not arise from itself but relies on strength to restrain it. Thus the weak are subdued by the strong, and the strong are revered by the weak—this is the natural order of control.

Yet is strength merely brute force? Is weakness merely timidity? It lies in virtue, not in might.

How can this be said? Gold is the hardest of all things; water is the softest. Gold may be hard, yet once broken, it cannot be mended. Water may be soft, yet once struck, it cannot be severed. Thus water’s softness perfects its hardness, while gold’s hardness does not escape its weakness.

Yan Ying was a dwarf, yet he served as chief minister of Qi. Gan Luo was a child, yet he became a fine chancellor of Qin. Jiao Ru was a giant, yet the people of Lu crushed his throat. Chang Wan was a warrior, yet Hua Yun of Song carved his flesh.

Yan Ying’s stature was short—was he not weak? Gan Luo had not yet come of age—was he not young? Jiao Ru was large enough to fill a carriage—was he not strong?

Chang Wan could tear apart leather with his strength—was he not brave? Yet Jiao Ru and Chang Wan lacked the wisdom to preserve their lives, while Yan Ying and Gan Luo possessed strategies sufficient to govern a state. Is this not because the power of virtue differs from mere strength, and true strength differs from mere weakness?

Thus, Qian (Heaven) is firm and unyielding, yet in its extremity invites regret; humility and lowliness can achieve the honor of greatness—such is their outcome. Now, what is called virtue? It is nothing but compassion and benevolence. What is called strength? It is nothing but violence and brutality. If one acts with benevolence and compassion, even Heaven and Earth do not oppose it, and ghosts and spirits will seek refuge—how much more so those near at hand? If one acts with violence and brutality, even the nine clans will turn their hearts away, and the six relations will look askance—how can one’s corpse escape being cast far off?

Therefore, virtue is what the multitudes rely upon; strength is what a single man depends on. Relying on the strength of a single man, one cannot achieve true strength; riding the favor of the multitudes, one cannot be truly weak. Thus, Zhou could draw iron bows, and the world feared him like tigers and wolves; Yao’s robes were too light to bear, yet the world cherished him like parents. Yet though tigers and wolves make men fear them, can one say tigers and wolves are stronger than men? Though parents make their children love them, can one say parents are weaker than their children? The principle of strength and weakness is thus made clear.

Therefore, the enlightened rulers of old governed the world through the Dao, knowing that the hearts of the people cannot be controlled by force, nor great renown achieved through violence. Thus, they cultivated abundant virtue to refine themselves and governed with gentle benevolence below. Thereby, without speaking, their trust spread; with folded hands, their transformation took effect. As a result, the eight directions offered sincerity, and the four quarters sent interpreters—how could this be merely one state submitting or the hundred clans sharing in their power?

Alas! The violent rulers of old tyrannized the world, abandoning virtue to rely on force, forgetting themselves to demand from others. Though strong enough to sail boats, they could not restrain their desires; though capable of lifting tripods, they could not preserve their own nature and spirit. Thus, they turned the altars of the state to ruins and left the ancestral temples without heirs, forever mocked by later generations—was this merely weakness in their own time?

Sad indeed! Laozi said: "One who conquers others has force; one who conquers himself is strong." Is this not what it means?

**On Decrease and Increase, III**
The myriad people rely on the one man; the one man finds peace through the myriad people. Thus, the myriad people are the feet of the world, and the one man is its head. Yet though the myriad people are many, they cannot avoid the disasters of fire and water; though the one man is exalted, he cannot escape the humiliation of exile and execution. Is the fault not in the feet, but truly in the head?

For when water stirs, duckweed shifts; when wind blows, grass bends. In the age of Yao and Shun, every household could be enfeoffed; in the courts of Jie and Zhou, every household could be executed. Is the world more worthy there and foolish here, easier to govern above and harder below? It lies in what the ruler increases or decreases.

Thus, nothing increases more than the ruler’s frugality, and nothing decreases more than the ruler’s extravagance. Between frugality and extravagance lies the root of increase and decrease. The sun and moon are the brightest things under Heaven, yet even they have places they do not reach. If the ruler’s governance is frugal, the world is without striving; when the world is without striving, the myriad people receive its blessing—its greatness surpasses even the sun and moon. Jackals and wolves are the greatest harms under Heaven, yet even they have places they do not injure. If the ruler’s governance is extravagant, the world is full of affairs; when the world is full of affairs, the myriad people suffer its poison—its severity exceeds even jackals and wolves.

Therefore, the sage rulers of antiquity devoted themselves to cultivating frugal virtue: their halls were thatched, their robes plain and warm. They discarded rare goods and useless vessels, lightened taxes, reduced corvée labor, decreased the ruler’s personal desires, and increased the lives of the people. Thus, the world rejoiced, and each delighted in their existence.

The violent rulers of antiquity indulged in extravagance and excess: their towers were of jade, their forests of ivory, their robes embroidered, their food sumptuous. They sought rare goods and destroyed useless vessels, imposed heavy taxes, multiplied corvée labor, increased the ruler’s personal desires, and diminished the lives of the people. Thus, the world was impoverished, and men no longer feared death. If they did not fear death, how could they fear chaos? If they delighted in life, how could they not delight in peace?

Therefore, when the people are at peace, the Son of Heaven finds his peace; when the people are in chaos, the Son of Heaven suffers its disorder. If the ruler desires his own peace but does not consider the people’s peace, fears the people’s chaos but does not reflect on his own chaos—this cannot be called wisdom.

Moreover, cutting open the belly to feed the mouth cannot be called beauty; warming the heels to stir the heart cannot be called toil. The heart and mouth exist to preserve the heels and belly. If the belly is cut open, how is it different from cutting open the mouth? If the heels are warmed, how is it different from warming the heart? Thus, the ruler is called most exalted only because he has his people. If the people all increase, with whom will the ruler decrease? If the people all decrease, with whom will the ruler increase?

Therefore, one who decreases himself to increase others—when others have increased, they will also increase him. This is how Yao and Shun became supreme sages and preserved their long lives. One who increases himself to decrease others—when others have decreased, they will also decrease him. This is how Gui and Xin sank into utter folly and brought about their own destruction. Thus, is not the path of self-decrease truly the way of self-increase? Is not the path of self-increase truly the way of self-decrease? The way of increase and decrease is thus made clear.

Alas! Life is the weightiest principle; personal desires are matters of no urgency. Now, if I set aside what is not urgent for myself and aid the weightiest concerns of the myriad people, without speaking of profit, I broadly nurture life and growth. Abiding in the peace of the Southern Mountains, perpetually governing like the Northern Star—then who under all Heaven would decrease me?

Those whose cravings know no satiety and whose greed knows no bounds—scholars starve on husks and dregs while dogs and horses leave behind their grains and meats; people clothe themselves in furs and pelts while earth and wood flaunt their brocades and silks. Loyalty is not vainly sacrificed for substance, nor is profit forsaken for peril. Thorns sprout on the thoroughfare, and whales swim in boiling seas—then who in the Nine Provinces and Four Seas would truly benefit?

Thus, the Old Master said: "The Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the deficient." Is this not what it means?

**Reverence and Neglect (Fourth)**

In the age of remote antiquity, the human heart was as undifferentiated as grass and trees, taking its kind from feathers and fur. Later sages guided them with rites and music, instructed them in benevolence and righteousness. Only then did the institutions of ruler and minister, noble and base, become clearly ordered.

Yet of all that rites prioritize, nothing surpasses reverence; of all that rites corrupt, nothing exceeds neglect. Thus, serving Heaven with reverence brings the descent of spirits; governing the state with reverence brings harmony among the people. Serving Heaven with neglect invites divine deception; governing the state with neglect invites peril for the people. Those below who show no reverence are unfit to serve their lord; those above who show no reverence are unfit to command their ministers.

Therefore, the *Book of Changes* expounds the principle of humility in the hexagram "Earth within Mountain," while the Old Master sets forth the parable of the valley king in "Water below Sea." The *Airs of the States* mocks the rat for its lack of decorum in "The Rat Has Form," and the ancients recorded the rudeness of the talking crow—thus, the difference between reverence and neglect yields starkly different outcomes.

For this reason, an enlightened ruler, in governing all under Heaven, establishes altars to appoint generals, sits sideways on his mat to seek worthies, bestows bolts of silk upon recluses in their groves, and sends carriages to welcome them from alleyways. Thus, true dragons assume their positions, egrets flock to his court, and all under Heaven honor him, desiring to follow his transformation.

A benighted ruler, in governing all under Heaven, hitches up his robes to receive scholars, lets his hair hang loose to court the people, regards the worthy as so much straw, and treats the common folk like swine and cattle. Thus, swift steeds flee into valleys, flying geese vanish into clouds, and all under Heaven loathe him, wishing to escape his disgrace.

Now, one who reveres others need not debase himself—he does so to employ their talents; one who neglects others need not exalt himself—he only incurs their resentment. How can this be explained?

Of old, Marquis Wen reined in his carriage before Ganki’s gate, and King Zhao built a lodge for Guo Wei—thus, men of talent inevitably gathered, and fleet-footed steeds returned. Why? Because reverence brought them. Duke Huan of Qi grew arrogant at Kuiqiu, and Emperor Gaozu of Han lightly endured the scolding at Zhao—thus, the feudal lords failed to submit, and great ministers plotted. Why? Because neglect brought this about.

Yet the reverence shown earlier was not merely for others—it was self-reverence. The neglect shown earlier was not merely for others—it was self-neglect. Thus, revering one person delights a thousand; neglecting one person angers a thousand. All wish to know the reverence of good people but do not practice its source; all wish to know the neglect of bad people but do not abandon its cause. This is like gazing south to seek Yan or traveling north to reach Yue—truly unattainable.

Moreover, the lord of men is the standard for all under Heaven. His deeds are recorded in state documents, his words inscribed by court historians. A single good act shines like auspicious clouds, bringing joy to all under Heaven; a single evil act darkens like an eclipse at dawn, drawing lament from all under Heaven. He cannot be likened to a common man, careless in reverence and neglect.

Thus, when someone asked Tian Zifang, "Do the rich and noble scorn others, or do the poor and lowly scorn others?" Zifang replied: "If a feudal lord scorns others, he loses his state; if a grandee scorns others, he loses his household. The poor and lowly, if their conduct violates the Dao and their words diverge from harmony, depart like casting off worn sandals—how can they be equated? Thus, tigers and leopards tumbling into ravines are instantly ground to powder, while ants riding the wind suffer not the slightest harm—the principles of weight and lightness cannot be spoken of in the same breath.

Therefore, the Duke of Zhou, son of King Wen, took care to spit out and chew his food; while Yan Ying’s charioteer, a mere servant, remained arrogantly self-satisfied. Is this not because the paths of reverence and neglect differ for the noble and the base?

The inchworm stretches by first contracting, and the osprey strikes by first lowering itself—thus, the noble humbling themselves before the lowly greatly win the people. Therefore, the Old Master said: "Put oneself last, and one finds oneself first." Is this not what it means?

**Thickness and Thinness (Fifth)**

The greatest virtue is called life; the highest nobility lies in destiny. Thus, two arms are weightier than the Four Seas, and the myriad things are fewer than one’s own body. Though endowed with spirit by Heaven and Earth and entrusted with form and qi by one’s parents, one also depends on nurture to fulfill one’s heavenly principle.

Now, the pine and cypress possess towering integrity, yet if choked with manure and irrigated with brine, they wither before the morning is out. Ice and snow possess unmatched hardness, yet if stored in a dark well or sheltered in a secluded peak, they may endure the height of summer without melting. The nature of the pine and cypress is not untrue, yet they swiftly decay; the nature of ice and snow is not fluid, yet they persist. Was this ordained by Heaven? No—it results from how they are nurtured.

How much more does this apply to man, who differs from the pine and cypress in permanence? If nurture is misapplied, how can one hope for immortality? It is not merely a matter of ice and snow’s fleetingness—if nurture follows the proper way, how can one fail to extend life? Thus, the length of life’s span depends on the thickness or thinness of nurture.

Alas! Food and drink, men and women—these are the great desires inherent in man. All desire to enrich themselves yet do not know that enrichment leads to impoverishment; all detest thinness yet do not know that thinness leads to thickness. How can this be explained?

Of old, the filial and benevolent lords of Xinling indulged in endless nights of revelry, wallowing in wine and sensual pleasures, giving free rein to their passions and desires—this was not true enrichment of the self.

Yet in the end, they met with the grief of premature death, perishing beneath the Yellow Springs—this was thinness indeed, and to the extreme. The Old Master and Master Peng cultivated arts to extend life, observing prohibitions against cooked food, restraining the hun and po souls—this was not that they did not thin themselves. Yet they preserved longevity without end, ascending to the heights of the clouds—this was thickness indeed, and to the greatest degree.

External things are but instruments for nurturing life. If nurture exceeds its proper measure, they become the very source of life’s ruin. Thus, fire is fitting for tallow, and wood for water. Yet if one were to douse a tiny flame with the waters of rivers and lakes, or drench a royal candle with gallons of tallow, it would surely be extinguished. For the allotment of life and destiny is truly finite, while the heart’s cravings for desires are inherently boundless. To pursue endless desires with a finite life—how could one not fall into hardship?

Thus, the *Yi* preserves moderation in food and drink, and the *Rites* admonishes the boundaries between men and women—there is reason in this. Moreover, to occupy the exalted position of the Nine-Fives is to possess the utmost nobility in the world; to command the multitudes of billions is to hold the utmost wealth. Yet if one neglects the nurture of life, even the five viscera and four limbs are no longer one’s own—how then could one possess what lies beyond the body?

To cast fine jade before toads or shoot bright pearls at sparrows—abandoning what is precious to seek what is base—men would deem this folly. Yet to treat the weight of one’s most exalted life as light and cast it beneath the sway of desires—how could this not be folly? Thus, silt may muddy a river but cannot muddy the sea; wind may uproot a tree but cannot uproot a mountain. Desires suffice to disorder the petty man but cannot move the noble one.

When Confucius thirsted and came upon the waters of Robber’s Spring, he refused to drink on principle; yet Zigong of Zheng dipped his fingers to taste the broth. When Liuxia Hui shared a bed with a woman, he remained uncorrupted; yet Huafu of Song risked his life for illicit pleasure. The Duke of Zhou left behind the injunction against wine, while King Zhou of Yin drowned in drunkenness and met his ruin. Jieyu declined the impropriety of sharing a carriage, while Lady Jiang yielded to lewdness without shame—was this not because integrity and excess differ, and thickness and thinness are not the same?

When the spirit is overused, it is exhausted; when the body is overused, it is wearied. To seek long life while both spirit and body are worn—such a thing has never been heard of. If the lord of men truly treasures his spirit and qi within and curtails his desires without, heeds the warnings against reckless indulgence, and reveres the teachings of nourishment, he may forever preserve the longevity of the immortals and ever remain a sage and enlightened ruler. Would this not be felicitous?

Thus, the Old Master said: *"Cast the self aside, and the self endures."* Is this not what he meant?

**On Order and Chaos (Section Six)**

Order and chaos in the state depend upon the Way of civil and martial governance. In ancient times, the sages created writing to convey hidden sentiments and carved bows and arrows to overawe the unyielding—both of which have endured from antiquity to the present. Thus, civil governance brings order, and martial governance quells chaos. Yet civil governance, though it establishes order, does not necessarily prevent chaos; martial governance, though it suppresses chaos, does not necessarily achieve order. Therefore, preventing chaos lies in employing martial measures, while fostering order lies in employing civil measures—like the alternating use of hands and feet, or the successive loading of boats and carriages.

Thus, when the Han founder boasted of his achievements, Lu Jia admonished him to value learning; when the Duke of Lu attended an assembly, Confucius urged him to prepare defenses—each for good reason. Now, civil governance guides through virtue, and virtue resides in inner sincerity, not in ostentatious display. Martial governance demonstrates authority, and authority lies in self-preservation, not in vaunting strength. If one relies on vaunting strength, then even if King Wu of the Three Dynasties had wielded many sharp weapons, he would only have exposed his defeat. If one relies on ostentatious display, then even if Lu had donned the full garb of the Ru, it would not have saved its weakness.

Thus, the First Emperor built the Great Wall and waged ceaseless wars, exhausting the people until they could bear no more. This allowed men like Chen She to exploit his failures and rise from his vaunted strength. Wang Mang constructed the Ling Terrace, promoted ritual and music, and levied taxes without restraint, reducing the people to destitution. This enabled the followers of the Gengshi Emperor to profit from his collapse, which began with his empty display. The First Emperor’s martial rule over the realm was like a potter shaping clay—though he strove for grandeur, he did not realize that thinness invites fragility. Wang Mang’s civil rule was like a carpenter cutting timber—though he prided himself on his skill, he did not see that fineness hastens breakage. Both ultimately turned order into chaos, for they failed to grasp the greater principle.

Now, civil governance presents patterns to the people, and these must be simple and clear. Simplicity ensures ease of compliance; complexity breeds resistance and obstruction. Martial governance demonstrates preparedness, and this must lie in tranquility. Tranquility ensures self-preservation, allowing one to remain at ease while awaiting the enemy’s exhaustion. To await exhaustion with ease ensures victory in every battle; to avoid resistance and obstruction ensures the success of all teachings. When teachings spread and the multitude harmonizes, when battles are won and foes cease their incursions, then one may still the realm with inaction and moisten it with perfect benevolence—this is how the sage-ruler attains order.

Yet these two rulers sought not within but without, governed not by nature but by emotion, burdened the people with excessive civil measures, and oppressed them with violent martial rule. Thus, they could not win the hearts of the realm. Even so, their failures had deeper roots. Long ago, Boyi dug wells and Suiren bored wood to make fire—today, we still rely on the benefits of water and fire. Yet Zhi Bo used them to flood Zhao’s city, and Dong Zhuo used them to burn the Han court—such harm was also extreme. Thus, civil and martial governance are the sharp instruments of statecraft, yet how often have usurpers used these very methods to throw the realm into chaos?

Thus, Zhang Han divided Qin’s lands with military force, and Tian Chang usurped Qi’s throne with benevolence and righteousness. Even order cannot be without its chaos—it depends entirely on the ruler’s control. Therefore, the herder of horses first removes their harm, and the driver of sheep swiftly whips their rear. If the rear is not whipped, the sheep go astray; if harm is not removed, the horses are lost. Lu could not remove the harm of the Three Families, so the state rebelled; Jin could not whip the rear of the Six Ministers, so its lands were divided. If one cannot do these things, then even with simple civil measures and tranquil martial governance, one only aids chaos—how can order be achieved?

Thus, the sage does not govern bandits without the Way of civil and martial governance, and ministers do not rebel without these same methods. Civil and martial governance have their private uses, for the ruler has lost his grip. Therefore, Confucius said: *"When the world follows the Dao, ritual, music, and punitive expeditions issue from the Son of Heaven."* Is this not what he meant?

**On Success and Failure (Section Seven)**

Just as a colt’s speed and endurance depend on the strength of its four legs, and the soaring of a phoenix or the flight of an arrow relies on the power of its six pinions, so too does the sage who guides the course of an enlightened ruler seize the moment, employing timber of the finest quality to serve as the limbs of governance.

Yet while the land’s mountains and rivers reveal their hazards, and the seasons of winter and summer mark their appointed times, the hearts of ordinary men remain obscure and unfathomable. Even the Uncrowned King found them inscrutable, and Emperor Yao deemed them difficult to command—thus, employing them inevitably entails both success and failure.

Why say this? The ruler is a boat, and the minister is the water. Water can float the boat, but it can also capsize it; ministers can assist the ruler, but they can also endanger him. Thus, the Three Heroes brought Han to prosperity, while the Six Ministers led Jin to ruin; Tao Zhu’s presence made Yue a hegemon, yet the rise of the Tian clan spelled the end of Qi. Though the task was the same, the outcomes diverged.

Men are filled with boundless deceit, their true and false natures manifold. Some appear reverent yet harbor contempt; others speak of loyalty but act in betrayal. Some scorn the corrupt yet covet wealth; some remain steadfast in poverty but grow dissolute in riches. Some commit grave errors seeking change; others, high in rank, grow suspicious of themselves. Some forget gratitude when profit beckons; others flee punishment only to sow discord. In such cases, divination by milfoil and tortoiseshell proves insufficient, and even spirits cannot settle the matter.

For the sharpest blade is of utmost weight, and the human heart is hard to know. To entrust such a weighty instrument to a heart so inscrutable, without discerning truth from falsehood, and merely trusting hearsay of praise or blame—even one with Huo Guang’s talent may succeed, while one with Wang Mang’s conduct may fail.

Thus, when judged by clan ties, even Guan Shu and the Duke of Zhou were not without loyalty or perversity; when tested by kinship, Dou Ying and Lü Lu were not without uprightness or treachery. When weighed by merit, Wang Ling and Jing Bu were not without loyalty or rebellion; when considered by old friendship, Fan Kuai and Lu Wan were not without parting or staying. If chosen for their skill with the brush, men like Zhang Tang may deceive; if rewarded for their eloquence, men like Zhufu Yan may act perversely. If their wisdom and strategy abound, Chen Ping cannot be solely relied upon; if their schemes are exceptional, Han Xin must be guarded against for fear of losing control.

The realm is vast—without such men, it cannot be governed alone, yet with them, there is always the risk of rebellion. Why not, then, employ their talents while preventing their disorder?

Consider how hair grows upon the head—it must be combed; how nails crown the fingers—they must be trimmed each month. If nails are left untrimmed, they grow too long and hinder use; if hair is left uncombed, it becomes ever more tangled. Hair and nails are close to the body, devoid of consciousness, yet even they become troublesome if not properly tended. How much more so with ministers, who are not of the same flesh, whose hearts are prone to change? Entrusting them with judgments of good and evil, following their right and wrong—this cannot be done lightly.

Thus, he who travels a long road must rely on the strength of a fine steed, and he who governs the realm must seek the service of worthy ministers. Yet even a well-trained steed cannot be ridden without reins, and even a trusted minister cannot be employed without retaining authority.

For the charioteer whose reins are too tight causes his horse to stumble and refuse to advance; if too loose, the horse grows arrogant and seeks ease. Only a master like Zaofu can ensure that looseness does not lead to idleness and restraint does not hinder progress.

Likewise, the ruler whose authority is too severe makes his ministers fearful and uneasy; if too lenient, they grow insolent and prone to disorder. Only a sage can ensure that leniency does not lead to chaos and severity does not breed unrest.

To fear a horse’s tendency to bolt and abandon riding in favor of walking would make a long journey impossible; to dread a minister’s potential for rebellion and forsake their aid would leave the realm ungoverned. Knowing a horse is fit to ride yet failing to grasp its reins cannot prevent it from running wild; knowing a minister is useful yet neglecting to hold authority cannot stop him from causing disorder.

Thus, Xiang Yu’s rejection of Fan Zeng was like abandoning the horse to walk on foot; though the Han emperor had Cao Cao, it was as if he rode without reins—how could defeat not follow?

Therefore, Confucius said: *"Only titles and insignia must never be lent to others."* Is this not what he meant?

**On Truth and Falsehood (Section Eight)**

A ruler cannot transform the realm alone; he must rely on worthy assistants. The hearts of men are not easily governed; they await careful discernment. Only when petty men are banished to the wilds and gentlemen occupy the court can governance be deemed successful.

Yet good and evil arise together, right and wrong intertwine. Form is revealed, and shadow follows; lips perish, and teeth grow cold. Where there is truth, falsehood cannot be absent.

Thus, emperors and kings throughout the ages, in governing their states and families, have strained their bodies and minds in reverence. Yet when it comes to those they enfeoff or appoint, even the foolish and lowly clench their fists and gnash their teeth in resentment; when it comes to those they punish or exile, they falsely bestow the titles of worthy and good. This is the lament of those with understanding.

The mountain parrot lacks numinosity, yet its buyer calls it a phoenix; the wild qilin is an auspicious omen, yet its injurer deems it common. Now, the qilin and phoenix have their depictions, while the Tang parrot remains unrecognized—still, the true is taken for the false, and the false for the true. How much more so with the sentiments of loyalty and treachery, the natures of tranquility and restlessness? The foolish and composed resemble the upright; the cunning and frenzied resemble the worthy. Those who keep themselves pure cannot align with others; those who defy authority fall short in their sovereign’s esteem. Emotions and circumstances bear no visible form, and the workings of the heart lie beyond the reach of sight or hearing. To ensure that silver and lead do not mix, that the waters of the Zī and Méng remain distinct in taste—such an achievement may come but once in ten thousand generations.

Thus, King Wu of Zhou executed Bi Gan at the behest of the usurper Zhòu; Confucius withdrew from Lu when the Ji clan usurped power; Qin put Bai Qi to death to elevate the Marquis of Ying; Zhao trusted Guo Kai and killed Li Mu; Bian He presented his jade only to suffer mutilation at the hands of the King of Chu; and Beiguo, though merely blowing the *yu*, partook of the salary of Qi. Cases like these abound—what is deemed right is not necessarily true, and what is deemed wrong is not necessarily false. Thus, the boundary between truth and falsehood involves subtle arts that cannot be left unexamined.

Why? What the multitude praises cannot be assumed good; what the multitude condemns cannot be assumed evil. Those I favor cannot be assumed worthy; those I distance cannot be assumed base. How to make this clear? In ancient times, when Yao managed the floodwaters, Gun was recommended by all, yet the floods remained unchecked. When Wei attacked Zhongshan, Yue Yang was scorned by many, yet Zhongshan was ultimately conquered. Deng Tong gained favor through a dream from the Han emperor, though he lacked the talent of Fu Yue; Qu Yuan was exiled by the King of Chu, though he bore no guilt like Gong Gong’s. Thus, the consensus of the crowd is not necessarily right, and solitary insight is not necessarily wrong.

Therefore, the enlightened ruler seeks counsel from his ministers, scrutinizes his own reflections, addresses difficulties before ease, and investigates the evident to fathom the subtle. Only then can those appointed feel no shame in their rewards, and those guilty evade no responsibility—this is how governance may be deemed proper. Just as a fine steed is tested in gallop to distinguish it from the sluggish—without need of Sun Yang’s judgment—or a sharp blade is proven in cutting to reveal its edge—without reliance on Feng Hu’s discourse—so too, when faced with those difficult to know, assign them tasks, and truth and falsehood will reveal themselves, putting an end to the world’s disputes.

Thus, the ancients employed men by sending them afar to observe their loyalty, keeping them near to assess their reverence and diligence, entrusting them with plans to gauge their wisdom, burdening them with affairs to test their abilities, mingling them with others to discern their integrity or excess, exposing them to profit to determine their greed or incorruptibility, placing them in hardship to see their benevolence, and subjecting them to peril to verify their trustworthiness. By tracing their conduct to probe their nature, listening to their words to distinguish their true feelings, exhausting the eight tests of Lü Shang and verifying the nine virtues of Gao Yao, they ensured that even raw silk, once dyed, would not revert from its hue, and white jade, cast into mud, would remain unstained—while yellow leaves wither together, the green pine stands alone amid frost. Thus, the false depart, and the true are obtained.

Confucius said: *"Examine carefully what the multitude deems good; examine carefully what the multitude deems evil."* This is what he meant.

**On Similarity and Difference**

Things of the same sound resonate; things of the same *qi* seek one another. Though the tiger dwells in a different valley from the wind, when the tiger roars, the valley wind rises; though the snake is not mountain mist, when the snake stirs, mountain mist arises—such is the principle of sameness. Yet different kinds form separate groups, and different natures may follow the same path. Though the clam transforms from the sparrow, it does not consort with sparrows; though the mandarin duck arises from the rat, it does not pair with rats—such is the principle of difference.

Now, fathers and sons, brothers, though not distant, do not necessarily share the same heart; rulers and ministers, friends, though not close, do not necessarily harbor different minds. Thus, Gusou was foolish while Chonghua was sagely; Dao Zhi was greedy while Liuxia was incorrupt; Liu Ji was in distress while Ji Xin burned; Bo Tao starved while Jue Ai died. Like soot and ash emerging together yet separating in flight, or glue and lacquer born apart yet binding firmly—so too do natures differ, and similarity and difference cannot be conflated.

The *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* says: *"People unite at the gate,"* yet the third line reads: *"Armed men lie hidden in the grass."* Thus, even in sameness, difference cannot be absent. There are those who appear the same yet differ in heart; those who seem different yet share the same within; those who begin alike yet end apart; those who start differently yet converge in the end. There are those who differ from me, yet I align with them; those who do not differ from me, yet I diverge from them. How to make this clear?

In ancient times, Chen Ping outwardly deferred to Empress Lü yet inwardly remained loyal to the House of Liu; Cheng Ying feigned allegiance to Sun Jiu while secretly protecting Zhao’s orphan. Zhang Er and Chen Yu were once sworn brothers who would die for each other, yet later became as distant as the stars Shen and Shang; Guan Zhong and Duke Huan of Qi bore the grudge of a crossbow shot, yet ultimately shared a bond like fish and water. The Tian clan deceived the Duke of Qi with false loyalty, yet the Duke trusted them all the more; Fan Zeng gave his utmost loyalty to Xiang Yu, yet Xiang Yu grew ever more suspicious. Thus, the hearts of similarity and difference cannot be measured by a single standard.

Therefore, the wise observe slowly and listen carefully, dwelling on high to gaze afar. Adapting to the needs of the time, they follow whatever is fitting—aligning with what can be aligned, differing from what must be differed from. Thus, Wei Qing, though a mere stable hand, was entrusted with command of the Han armies; You Yu, though a captive, was given charge of Qin’s state affairs. If even Wei Qing and You Yu, though distant from Qin and Han, could be aligned with when alignment was right, how much more so with fathers and brothers, where alignment is possible?

Yet Guan Shu was a brother, yet the Duke of Zhou executed him with the utmost severity; Shi Hou was a son, yet Shi Que put him to death in the name of great righteousness. If even Guan Shu and Shi Hou, though close to the Duke of Zhou and Shi Que, could be differed from when difference was right, how much more so with rulers and ministers, friends, where alignment is possible?

Thus, those who can align with what should be aligned and differ from what should be differed from bring fortune, while those who cannot bring calamity. Shun aligned with the Eight Virtuous Ones and differed from the Four Criminals, thereby securing an eternal name as a sage; King Zhou of Yin failed to align with the Three Benevolent Ministers and failed to differ from the Two Treacherous Ministers, thus inviting the disgrace of ruin. Here lies the subtlety of alignment and difference—one must not lose its delicate balance.

Confucius said: *"Act upon perceiving the subtle signs, without waiting for the day’s end."* This is precisely what he meant.

**Chapter Ten: Love and Hate**

The sun’s brilliance illuminates even the darkest depths, yet when veiled by thick clouds, its radiance is obscured. Water’s clarity reflects all that approaches, yet when muddied with sediment, all images vanish. If the sun and water lose their natural clarity, is it not because clouds and sediment alter their essence?

So too with human discernment: though keen in spirit and wisdom, when inwardly swayed by attachments and outwardly gripped by resentment, judgments of right and wrong, gain and loss cannot but be clouded.

How to illustrate this? In ancient times, Chonghua (Shun) was filial, yet his blind father, Gusou, resented him and acted unjustly. Wusheng was virtuous, yet his mother, Wu Jiang, despised him and brought chaos upon herself. A crane, though lowly, was prized by the ruler of Wei, who carried it in a splendid carriage; a horse, though humble, was cherished by the King of Chu, who draped it in embroidered silks. Even among blood kin, where bonds should be unbroken, hatred arises; even among birds and beasts, where distinctions are clear, affection persists. How much more so with enlightened rulers and trusted ministers, whose trust does not match that of parents for their children? When flatterers charm their lords with skill surpassing that of cranes and horses, how few remain free from the delusions of love and hate!

Thus, Ji An and Yuan Ang were exiled for their loyal remonstrances, while Ji Ru and Han Yan gained favor through sycophancy. Shen Tong was rewarded for his flattery, while Jia Yi was estranged for his forthrightness. How profound is the bewilderment wrought by love and hate!

When a loyal minister serves his lord, he confronts his lord’s faults to correct them and seeks to perfect his lord’s virtues—yet the lord perceives this as hatred. When a flatterer serves his master, he praises his master’s virtues to excess and conceals his master’s flaws—yet the master perceives this as love. Little do they realize that heeding criticism and reforming leads to the path of the sagely ruler, while delighting in praise and ignoring faults fosters unrighteousness. Thus, guiding a lord toward the Way is the greatest love; leading him into unrighteousness is the greatest hatred. Yet lords fail to discern the true nature of loyalty and flattery, carelessly shifting their favor and disdain. They believe those who love them deserve love in return, bestowing honors upon their kin; they believe those who hate them deserve hatred in return, visiting annihilation upon their families. Thus, the sincerity of those who would carve out their hearts or slit their throats is cast aside, while the likes of those who lick sores or suck ulcers are elevated to high rank.

Moreover, rewards are meant to encourage goodness, and titles to honor the worthy. If the unworthy gain renown and the undeserving receive rewards, how can the world be encouraged? Laws are meant to forbid wrongdoing, and punishments to chastise evil. If the loyal are condemned by law and the upright suffer punishment, how can the world be restrained?

Thus, when the Han despised Yong Chi, Zhang Liang urged that he be enfeoffed; when the Sui favored the young tutor, Bo Bi advocated his overthrow.

Why is this so? When those with merit are harmed, it becomes an inauspicious omen; when those without virtue are favored, it is... ... ... [text missing] *Taiping Liangtong Shu*, Scroll the Lower, ends.
