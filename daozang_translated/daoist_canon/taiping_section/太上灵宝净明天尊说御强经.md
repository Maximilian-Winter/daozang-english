At that time, the Most High Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Heavenly Worthy, on the dawn of the *gengxu* day of the sixth month in the *jiyou* year, convened a grand assembly of the host of perfected beings and expounded the supreme secret methods of the Pure Brightness.

At that moment, the newly initiated disciple, Perfected One of Benevolent Culture, stood in attendance before the Heavenly Worthy. His countenance bore a look of sorrow, his spirit heavy with grief, his heart troubled and disordered, as though he had lost something.

The Heavenly Worthy, deeply aware that the Perfected One of Benevolent Culture was still entangled in manifold cares, lingering in the mundane world, unable to shed deluded views, and not yet attuned to the true principle—unaware of the methods for preserving the spirit, repelling *qi*, nurturing tranquility, and delivering all beings—spoke thus:

"Perfected One of Benevolent Culture, why does your face bear such sorrow? Is there something that weighs upon your mind?"

The Perfected One of Benevolent Culture bowed his head in reverence, prostrating himself again and again, and weeping, replied:

"Though this disciple was fortunate to be born into the world of humans and encountered a true master who revived the great teaching, appointing this disciple as a leader of the ritual assembly, I remain unable to escape calamity and peril. All the disciples of this assembly share in this suffering. I have heard that those who bear the precious talismans are all delivered from every misfortune and disaster. Yet now, in the village where this disciple dwells, pestilential toxins rage unchecked, sparing neither the virtuous nor the wicked, all suffering its harm."

Though honored to partake in the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred assembly, where I and all fellow disciples diligently study the arts of immortality without daring the slightest negligence, my younger brother and sister at home—along with many of our disciples—have all contracted virulent sores, their suffering unbearable. Those who turn to the Dao in search of goodness, hoping to escape calamity, now find no deliverance, and thus my sorrow runs deep. I had intended to wait for an opportune moment to present this grave question, yet the Heavenly Worthy has deigned to inquire first, and I cannot help but weep.

The Heavenly Worthy first entrusted the great teaching to us for practice, yet we ourselves remain unable to escape disaster. Meanwhile, those steeped in the ten evils, their wills hardened and unyielding, defile the Dao and corrupt its laws, beyond all hope of transformation. I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow special guidance, that we may be shielded from the seasonal plagues that afflict us.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy ascended the seat, and with compassion spoke the supreme method to the Perfected One of Benevolent Culture and the others:

Heaven and Earth are impartial, shaping the myriad things, their fundamental nature neither good nor evil. It is the people of the world who, through self-interest, bring disaster upon themselves. The Supreme Emperor, pitying those who fall into ruin and lose their true nature, established the Most High Numinous Treasure method to teach them the way of long life. Yet when pestilence and plague arise, it is because they have violated its precepts. Each has its own spirits to oversee its workings: those who do good may rejoice, while those who do evil have cause to fear.

Consider one who paves a broad road, its bricks laid smooth and even, easy to traverse. Beside it, another sets snares and pits to trap tigers and rhinoceroses. If a traveler ignores the great road, wandering heedlessly, and stumbles into the trap, he then blames the roadbuilder for not making the path straight. But you, having chosen the road, must not trigger the mechanism—it was not set for you, yet you blundered into it. The road and the trap serve different purposes, one for good, the other for ill.

Now, if disciples transgress or neglect the teachings, their visualization is impure, their practice untimely, their diet unrestrained, then the guardian spirits of rectitude all withdraw. When goodness is obscured, transgressions become known, and the spirits who mete out punishment seize the opportunity to observe and strike, spreading this toxic *qi*. Once illness takes root, if one fails to recognize their faults and instead resents the Dao or blames their master for failing to protect them, their suffering only deepens.

Moreover, if those in one’s household do not unite in devotion, awakening to the practice, but instead indulge in misconduct, turning their backs on the master’s cultivation, then the spirits, too, lie in wait, secretly exacting punishment. This is not without justice—it is how evil admonishes good. Having already incurred guilt, if one still harbors doubt and complains that their master, though practicing the Dao and performing the rites, cannot protect their family, then consider: if they engage in licentiousness, worshiping depraved spirits, how could I possibly aid them?

In all matters of seasonal nurturing, the key lies in balance. Wear the talismans and transmit the scriptures to honor supreme goodness; ingest medicines and practice *qi*-absorption and visualization to generate true *qi*. I possess sacred talismans to be worn day and night, so that a hundred demons will tremble in fear and the spirits of goodness will follow and guard you. There are also immortal formulas to refine *qi*, methods of visualization and *qi*-absorption to relieve suffering—such as the talismanic charms for healing and the elixirs of red dispersal and potent cinnabar.

The principles of spring dispersion, summer tonification, autumn consolidation, and winter storage are not few in number. Yet you have never truly examined their meaning, merely hoarding them away, believing that as disciples of the Most High, you are naturally exempt from such trials. How is this different from wishing for a harvest without plowing, or clothing without raising silkworms?

Now, I shall once more bestow upon you the divine talismans for warding off plague, the secret scripts of red dispersal and potent cinnabar, along with all methods for wearing and ingesting them. Choose an auspicious day to transmit them to you. There is also a secret incantation, which goes:

"Oṃ ā-yī-wū-kě-qiè. Mù-zhī (pronounced *zhǐ*) hùn-pó (pronounced *mǎ*). □ (pronounced *lǚ*). □ (pronounced *yǐn*)."

Recite this daily in purity, and the Divine Lords and spirit-generals shall guard and protect you day and night. The hundred spirits of plague and venom shall recognize you as a disciple of the Most High and stand in awe and reverence. Recite the scripture a hundred times, and the hundred demons shall shatter their skulls and split their brains. Should you fail to practice this, I can do nothing for you.

Thereupon, Perfected Lord Huìwén bowed twice and prostrated himself. The High and Luminous Great Envoy of the Nine Provinces inscribed it in cinnabar script, choosing an auspicious day to teach the methods of the arts to his disciples, who received and upheld them with faith. The Wondrous and Salvific True Lord of the High and Luminous Great Envoy of the Nine Heavens, who dispels plague and sends away pestilence, the True Talisman for Disaster Dissolution, bears this incantation:

"Cavern-Heaven’s Crimson Script,
Cinnabar numen shines in the void,
Driving plague, seizing venom.
By command of the Celestial Writ,
Golden Register and Jade Tablet,
All demons are expelled.
The Most High issues his decree,
The Primal Lady rests in peace.
Hasten! Hasten!
As the Purple Void of Great Purity commands and seizes.
The Most High Numinous Treasure, Pure and Luminous Heavenly Worthy expounds the *Scripture of Plague Dispelling*."
