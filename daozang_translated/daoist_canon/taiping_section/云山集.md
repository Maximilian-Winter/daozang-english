**Cloud and Mountain Collection, Volume One: Rhapsodies**

**Rhapsody on Nature**
Radiant before and illuminating after, erudite in antiquity and enlightened in the present.
Emerging is life, returning is death; stillness is nature, movement is the heart-mind.
Probing the numinous source of kalpas past, profound and elusive;
Embodying the wondrous function of non-arising, hidden and manifest, floating and sinking.

Before the primordial chaos was cleft, in the unmoving moment of *dāna*,
It revealed earthly patterns, merging obscurely into samādhi,
And emitted celestial light, attaining dawn-clarity as wisdom.
Thus it transcends illusory realms, indescribable in its evanescence;
Yet it accords with the true and constant, utterly unbound.

Therefore, in its use—whether in motion or stillness, speech or silence—
Its essence is beyond taste, color, sound, and fragrance.
Let loose, it drifts to the farthest reaches; gathered, it enters the finest subtleties.
Like cold ashes flaring anew, or a withered tree blooming again.

Refining the real to form the elixir, even spirits cannot fathom;
Molding emptiness into a clod, blades cannot harm.
Though actions and cessations vary endlessly, their root is one.
Some grasp and toy with it—seizing the moment when it arises;
Others nurture it with tranquility—drinking deeply of its purity.

The white ox vanishes beyond bounds, the jeweled pagoda dissolves without seam.
Hanging a word on the wall is no different from capturing spirit in a cliff’s wrinkles;
Turning within a staff’s strike is no stranger than plucking a verse from a wrestling match.

When things arise, it reflects; moved, it responds.
It stamps the stars and constellations in the depths of a limpid pool,
And manifests Hu and Han within a bright mirror.
Revolving the pivot in wondrous function, it is the great thoroughfare of flowing waves.
Striking a fragment of ease, even mountain clouds cannot compare;
Polished to round brilliance and purity, the moon on the river falls short.

Yet some, failing to drink from the divine spring, recklessly indulge the seven emotions;
Neglecting celestial wandering, they vie with the six senses.
Lighter than those who leap with swords or vie for coins,
They are not even as the drifting tile or empty boat.

Bound by the confines of form and vessel, they turn from the profound wind that could sustain them.
The gate of great giving stands unobstructed—like the braying of Pu-hua’s donkey;
The teaching without words shines most clearly—like the leaping of Hong-meng’s sparrows.

How grand! The laughter shared at Tiger Creek,
The solitary sigh of Nan-guo gazing at the sky.
Shu’s nine years of study perfected the great mystery;
A single night’s affirmation left no residue.

For vast or minute, coarse or fine, every phenomenon embodies the Dao;
From soaring birds to hidden fish, each form is true suchness.
Gongsun’s sophistry debates the "not-horse";
Hui Shi’s many devices question the joy of fish.

Hark! Scraping the wild elder’s eyes,
Severing the mountain boy’s finger.
Can one’s response be anything but a single "yes"?
Yan Hui sat in forgetfulness and attained mastery.

Deluded, the Jingwei bird carries earth to fill the sea;
Enlightened, the formless one seeks the pearl in the Red River.
A single misstep in action strays by a mile;
A word spoken misses by a thousand.

Yet to act with abandon is unobstructed;
The brush’s fall sweeps away all dust and grime.

---

**Rhapsody on the Heart-Mind**
Its nature arises from the Dao, its emotions are born of the heart-mind.
Gathering the roots of the senses, it governs the throat of good and evil.
Thoughts flow ceaselessly, the past does not halt, the present does not cease;
Ever renewing, it surfaces in motion and sinks in stillness.

When it is neither being nor non-being, it is perception and cognition.
Emerging, it clings to affairs and attaches to things;
Moving, it chases sounds and pursues forms.
It cannot be abandoned, nor can it be grasped.

It commands the legions of demonic grasses, enduring through kalpas;
Seated as the chief of the three karmas, it is never mastered.
Yet when worldly cares are stilled, the spirit abides in clarity.
Light blazes from cold ashes, auspiciousness arises in an empty chamber.

Vast beyond all bounds, it conceals the subtlest traces.
Shedding all entanglements, it arrives at unknowing yet feels near;
In steadfast embrace, it adapts to every use with ease.

Even in lighting incense, brewing tea, or sweeping the floor,
Whatever is casually grasped responds in kind;
Whatever is set down aligns perfectly.
The Yangtze, the Yellow, the Huai, and the seas—though their currents differ, their waters are one;
Hairpins, bracelets, broken plates—though their uses vary, their gold is the same.

Adapting to circumstances, it shifts its form;
Following conditions, it generates hues.
In stillness, it congeals like earth; in motion, it hangs like heaven.
When needed by the feet, it moves in crossed legs or paces;
When needed by the hands, it clenches into fists.

In action or rest, lifting or plucking, it presides as the formless master;
In seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving, it occupies the moment before engagement.

Yet to transcend the ten stages and three vehicles,
To encompass the five phases and four images—
Standing centered without leaning, preserving inner harmony without wavering—
A moment’s pride in superior insight may plunge one into today’s itch for scratching.

Where lies the essence of the Wei and Si traditions? In entering the hall and ascending the room.
What is the wonder of Zhuangzi’s garden? In pushing open the gate and laying down the staff.

How grand! A single aperture opens, eight faces gleam.
The pearl glows atop the void, the cinnabar circles within the jeweled tripod.
Merging heaven and earth into one body, it seizes creation to share its work.

Without image or self, it nurtures all like spring’s warmth;
Unobstructed and unclinging, it traverses the sky like the autumn moon.

Ah! Those who follow affairs and find peace return home by the road;
Those who use things as they are attain wonder in the flow.
The great measure of rivers and seas—what does it not contain?
The high-hung sun and moon—what place do they not illuminate?

The realm of self and things is one, being and non-being share the same essence.
This is the pivot of the five constants and hundred deeds, the essential summary of all sages and perfected beings.

*Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One – Seven-Character Ancient Verse (Long Poem)*

**Awakening to Emptiness**
In this vast kalpa, why such delusion? Like lotus roots coiled in green mud, we prolong our entanglement.
Who knows if the Creator merely plays with us, shifting valleys and boats east and west in the dead of night?
The heart is assailed by profit and desire, a spectacle more frenzied than the Yellow Gate’s turmoil;
Dazzled by empty flowers, we mistake them for reality.
The wind’s blade and kalpa-fire descend from heaven, fanning flames that scorch Kunlun’s jade and stone.
Worldly dust is swept away, all reduced to emptiness—until great pardon opens the cage.
Only then do we realize the yellow millet remains uncooked, suddenly startled by the wind at the tower’s eaves.
Opening our eyes, we recognize the nightmare’s horror; reflecting deeply, we see past affairs were all mistaken.
Heaven grants me good causes, leaping from the dust to attain true joy.
If asked how to reach emptiness without reliance, how could it compare to turning the wheel of the Profound Mystery?
The work complete, I shed this mortal garb, riding the wind back to the Five Clouds’ palace halls.

**Verifying Illusions**
The Daoist plays in the true samādhi, transforming with divine powers swift as a fox.
Silent as the abyss, yet thunder shakes the nine heavens; dwelling in stillness, yet sunlight illumines the dusty world.
The golden rooster crows—clay oxen flee; withered trees roar like dragons, stubborn stones howl.
Jade maidens play flutes, phoenixes sing; wooden men dance in rhythm, sinews twisting.
The subtlest movements trigger heaven’s gate-mechanism, clapping the void without end.
Neither being nor non-being, beyond measure—who can fathom it?
Now reversing, now flowing—who can know?
The great wonder demands nine years of cultivation; the seven sages lose their way on the path.
Pushing the staff and setting it down—when will they meet? Winking and blinking, they merely peer in vain.

**Verifying Dreams**
Of old, I heard of King Mu’s journey to the Dark Palace, where azure towers and crimson gates stood amid clouds.
Yet shifting to higher realms brought terror, and the heavenly wind blew him back to his cage.
I also heard of the Yellow Emperor’s land of Huaxu, where he walked the void as if treading solid ground.
Clouds and mist dissolved, mountains and valleys leveled—yet it still resembled emerging from a mural’s forest.
Spirit-wandering in dreams never leaves one’s place; riding the wind to the moon is not the constant way.
A single leap straight to Kunlun’s summit—who inherits the original, inherent truth?
The dusty world drifts in dream’s upheaval, truth and illusion vie like deer in a dispute.
The locust’s branches and ant’s battles rage—what are they but clamoring oysters and warring snails?
Awake or dreaming, both arise from primordial chaos; now, in waking or sleeping, I remain of the same lineage.
I ask the master: have you opened your eyes yet? A gust of wind carries

In the year’s cold, the sunken cavern conceals Fenglong’s might,
Pent and coiled, it lingers, bearing the surging Dao within.
Seizing the moment, moving with the season—no delay,
From spring’s beginning to summer’s end, amid yellow dust it lies.

To stretch yet not stretch, transforming into things,
Its twisted roots and gnarled knots delay Heaven’s work.
Wilderness and chaos offer no reliance,
Yet it stands tall, emerging at the Western Fork Palace.

Sprouting forth, shedding its sheath—pure and strong,
Branches spread, leaves unfurl, displaying its might.
The master, seeking the Dao, longs to enter the chamber,
Leaning at the gate, he becomes a green-robed youth.

Before Xiangyan’s fragrance could convey the message,
The wondrous transmission came from Master Suspended Gourd.
With an empty heart, it inwardly gathers the earth’s veins,
In an instant, ten thousand miles are traversed as if riding the wind.

Guarding the dragon’s offspring without the slightest loss,
Its jade sprouts remain untainted by the finest dust.
One day, when merit is complete, this power will serve,
Freely roaming the six directions, wandering without end.

Feng Quan teaches Qing to celebrate birth with Mount Du as blessing.

Before the primordial chaos divided, it embraced heaven and earth,
All things, great and small, were firmly preserved.
The Primordial Beginning, the August Jade Sovereign, established the central pole,
The Heavenly Pillar stands tall—its name is Kunlun.

Above, no canopy—only the eyes of heaven,
Below, no base—it upholds the earth’s axis.
Palaces coil atop the mountain’s peak,
The turning jade mechanism lies within its belly.

Towering crags, jade peaks rise in drought,
Soaring beyond form, unmatched in majesty.
Great Miaogu and Taihua,
Below, mere mounds—Jo and Song seem slight.

Divine beings, their skin gleaming like ice and snow,
Hearts like deep springs, in harmony with sun and moon.
Though kalpas and seas shift and change,
They remain ageless, neither old nor young.

I only wish the old immortal were like this mountain,
Forever youthful, his crimson face never fading.
Yet the foolish masses trample beneath,
All awakened from deafness and blindness, passing through the mysterious gate.

*Out-of-season peach blossoms*

The principles of things—flourishing and withering—follow their own time,
Deviating from the season, defying custom, the heart doubts itself.
This peach blooms untimely, surely not in season,
Its hidden fruit, none know.

Frost withers the hundred grasses, all perish,
Yet it stands alone, displaying heaven’s natural grace.
The Daoist cherishes this form unlike the common,
Breaking off a branch to show its marvel.

Alas, this kind has no gnarled roots,
Transplanted to the Cave of Eternal Spring,
It blooms and bears fruit for three thousand years,
A rare taste in Jambudvīpa, few attain.

*Sent to Lu Caiqing*

Fate toys with man as if tossing a ball,
Pointlessly bewitching, cunningly deceiving.
I recall the second and third months of Guiwei,
The old garden shaken by the cold of halberds and spears.

Exhausted, gasping, each fled in panic,
A thousand miles of hardship—travel was perilous.
This life, this body, borrowed and borrowed again,
Yet under your jade shelter, all was peaceful.

When would the sixth month’s summer rains come,
Startling news of Jin’s collapse, the villain overthrown?
Hao’s son slipped on the path, devoured by jackals,
The Wen family’s elegance, like clouds and water, at ease.

Of late, carriages depart morning and night,
Surely you anticipate returning home in brocade robes.
The heart’s longing pierces the southwest road,
The journey’s hues faintly trace the rising and falling hills.

This rustic, afflicted by confusion’s malady,
Dares not cling to the steed’s tail—how could he ascend?

*Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One—Five-Character Ancient Verse, Long Composition*

**Exhortation to the World**

Life spans but a hundred years,
Swift as a finger-snap.
All are playthings of Creation’s hand,
Restless, compelled by fate.
Hurried from dawn to dusk,
Anxious with joy and sorrow.
Matters of self dissolve to naught—
How much more those beyond?
Endless affairs of others,
Fortune and misfortune shown to you.
Evil thoughts pile like mountains,
While the good heart lacks even a speck.
When Old Yama arrives,
In an instant, none can stay.
I urge you, cease your folly,
Seek refuge in the Way.
Leap from the pit of karmic fire,
Abandon old paths trod.
Turn the mysterious pass,
And long life begins here.

**To Daoist Friend Lun Boyu**

Once beneath Purple Peak,
Clouds and mist unfolded side by side.
From the perilous pavilion, soft words flowed,
Morning and night, weariness forgot.
The west wind cleared the dust from my robe,
Staff and sandals followed in your wake.
Parting at Zhenyang, how desolate,
Eyes lingered as your steps slowed.
At the crossroads, we pledged Mount Crane,
Yet the current bore you—who could know?
Like a ram’s horn twisting,
Each move entangled in sorrow’s thread.
The southwest, a den of clouds and waters,
Set my heart’s banner adrift.
Fortune and misfortune are heaven’s decree,
Movement and stillness not of man’s design.
Your intent straight as a plumb line,
My heart round as a compass.
A thousand miles share the bright moon,
Not a hair’s breadth between.
Spirits fly to and fro,
Vague, without fixed time.
Roaming the earth as one,
How could we bear even a moment’s parting?
Treading the void, embracing emptiness,
Why doubt this floating flight?
From this, the Three Perfected meet,
Ever in the presence of the sacred.

**Dwelling in the Monastery**

Men dwell, not the monastery—
Why debate success or failure?
The monastery dwells, not men—
No different from worldly bonds.
Friends, clouds, and soaring halls,
Regarded as grass and dust.
Exhausting sweat and blood,
Yet all ends in ruin.
How much better the true person,
Reciting word by word.
Morning and night drinking jade dew,
Silently attaining divine understanding.
Floating beyond the six realms,
Swiftly transcending the three worlds.
Once the moon-pearl of enlightenment dawns,
Who would sell it in the mortal market?
I come to dwell briefly,
Unconcerned with spaciousness or confinement.
I seek only cloud-and-mist friends,
As if repaying debts from past lives.
At peace amid the clamor,
Fame and profit cannot buy steadfastness.
Heaven endows me with a cold, stern nature,
Yet I sit and let the vulgar stare.
Rising, I lament—

**Solitude’s Difficulty**

How hard to be truly alone!
Haughty disdain—how strange.
Suffering this profound mystery’s malady,
Who can cure its marrow-deep affliction?
Unwilling to bind myself,
How could I offer fine cuts?
A propitious wind stirs my spirit,
Staff and sandals light and swift.
North and south, east and west,
I wander, learning to stride.

**Secluded Dwelling**

Seclusion delights the rustic heart,
Worldly affairs left unattended.
Friends drift apart and reunite,
Servants and children follow your lead.
Neighbors like enemies,
Years pass without a word.
Worldly manners colder than ice,
Human feelings as bland as water.
Patched quail-robe in close view,
Coarse food, its savor forgot.
Unfettered in all things,
Contentment alone suffices.

**The Illusion of Form**

This body brings great suffering,
Forget the self—what cause for sorrow?
The form is most intimate,
Yet in the end, it becomes a mound of earth.
How much more the things beyond this body,
All illusory as the Tower of Nothingness.
The great earth labors to give life,
Yet all is fleeting, unfree.
All things are predestined,
Who can seek beyond?
The web of doubt shatters itself—
Rest, rest, and rest again.
Do not be a tool of emptiness,
Nor a prisoner of the real.
With a heart vast and at ease,
Roam in harmony with transformation.
In life, do nothing,
Let it be—do not cling.
Break free from the dusty chamber,
Within and without, untangled.
One day, the ancient moon of nature shines,
Radiant as autumn’s clear sky.

**Worldly Deceit**

Shutting the door, too lazy to go out,
The crowd’s judgment loses harmony.
Leaning on a staff, I walk the streets,
My sharp eyes despise the drifting throng.
The whole town blames my errors,
Cutting ties, they scorn my deceit.
How hard it is to be human—
Every move invites slander.
Examining myself, my heart is not yet ash,
Yet I feign madness as if truly deluded.
With a heart of ash, forgetting form,
Who fears demons and obstacles?
In this bustling world,
Nothing lacks a fixed appearance.
Each clings to their own bias,
Voices aligning with their kind.
The earth is all red dust,
From association, waves turn white.
Tasting the profound mystery’s flavor,
Sudden enlightenment reveals the true state.
The solitary moon of self-nature is round,
The heart’s expanse like the sky.
Leaping beyond the gate of life and death,
Piercing the treasury of light.

**Leaving the Monastery**

At first, I vowed to guard my folly,
Muddled, without clarity.
Long stillness gave way to restlessness,
Many mouths boasted and marveled.
Rotten meat draws flies,
Merchandise seeks its price.
Again and again, I met with frustration,
No time to dance or rest.
Unable to be without you,
Yet who among you is not false?
The hidden bird returns to its cage,
The white colt is harnessed.
Yu’s steps and cloud gatherings,
All are transformed by transformation.
The world delights in shock,
Hearing rumors, they clamor.
Pure admonition aids the real,
Why wish for others’ astonishment?
The wren soars in empty space,
How would the crow know fear?
A thousand dusts met with a smile,
Casually, I find respite.
The luminous truth above,
Each pursues their own—none rely on others.
Entering the realm of nothingness,
Enjoyment sweet as inverted sugarcane.
In the end, what is it like?
The world hides within the world.

**Dharma Body**

The wondrous Dharma Body of the profound mystery,
All things and self are fully endowed.
A speck of dust contains worlds,
Its vast measure embraces heaven and earth.
Great and small, myriad differences,
Yet their root is one and the same.
Like the vast ocean,
All creatures share its bounty.
Alas, those bound by emotion,
Again ensnared by form.
Sunk in the pit of birth and death,
Revolving like fur and skin.
Descending to the root, lost in kalpas,
Suffering as if inverted.
Sages offer expedient means,
Rescuing without abandonment.
Yet how can the wise remain blind,
Facing each other as in a dream?
The pot of heaven—

**The Pot of Heaven**

The pot of heaven touches the human realm,
Flawless, purely clear and cold.
Palaces and pavilions lean on empty azure,
Their grandeur linked to the blue mountains.
The balmy wind comes from the south,
Instantly banishing the Fire God’s heat.
Master Zhuang and Hui Shi,
Wielding dust whisks, discoursed on frost.
Ascending the Ripple-Viewing Tower,
Gazing down at the long, flowing stream.

**Wild Cranes**

Wild cranes each follow their own way,
Tall willows sway in the bright sunlight.
The host’s heart holds fine intent,
Yet he pours no "gosling-yellow" wine.
Instead, he brews a draught surpassing jade dust,
Stirring my withered thoughts to life.
Green cares dissolve the minutest threads,
Straightway reaching the land of Nothing-Whatsoever.
Supreme joy resembles the Fourfold Well—
Who can measure its bounty?
Who asks the Master of the Flowering Girdle,
Soft red dust and fragrant earth?

**Postscript to Dong Jiefu’s *Dream of the Yellow Root* Handscroll**

Day is but an open-eyed dream,
Night a dream within a dream.
Eyes open or lids closed—all is murk,
As rise and fall, decay and flourish play their idle games.
Be it butterfly or Zhou, none knows itself;
For whom do brows knit and eyes lift?
That *ruyi* found in Deng’s mansion,
Or world-conquering fame—all but millet cooked in an instant.
The world’s time flies so swiftly,
As the weaving crow darts through dawn and dusk.
Though one knows all things are utterly empty,
How few grasp the Great Transformation’s haste!
Yet this old man alone has fathomed the profound mystery,
Seeing clearly that waking and dream are not two.
Unwilling to vie for deer with lawsuits upon the crown,
He long since returned to the cloud-girt palace.

---

**In Memory of the True Man of No Desire**

An old immortal from Longyou,
His lifespan stretched before heaven’s birth.
With compassion, he gazed upon the mortal realm,
Witnessing the dusty world with open eyes.
Eighty-six years passed
Swift as the flick of a finger.
Yearning once more for the White Cloud Land,
He forsook the cinnabar well.
A form of iridescent clouds emerged,
Then dissolved like the shadow of a yellow magpie.
Straight into the vast, solitary sky he entered,
And soon all was still as a mirror.
The jewel left no echo,
And none among the onlookers understood.
In the empty hall, the night was not yet spent,
The moon hung crystalline on the pine’s tip.

---

**Worldly Affairs**

Myriad forms dwell in the vast expanse,
Moving and resting between high and deep.
The mechanism of transformation shifts with use,
The principles of things change with the times.
An outstretched arm turns present into past,
A turn of the head—withering or flourishing.
The unfeeling reverse their states,
Toying with floating life as if in play.
The child of primordial chaos raises the curtain,
Setting up the puppet stage.
Children bicker in their games,
Ants muster their armies in mock battle.
A single mass of illusion,
A hundred kinds of joy and sorrow.
Life and death turn like a wheel’s hub,
Kalpas pile like mustard seeds filling a city.
Self-made prisons without doors,
Willingly sinking into the pit of karmic fire.
The wheel turns without pause,
Suffering stretches endlessly ahead.
Great awakening is like seeking a fleeing hare—
Turn around and walk the Way.
Seek not elsewhere,
For the mind-ground is already leveled.

---

**To Lu Caiqing**

You now spur on your steed,
While I lag far behind.
Next autumn, when the long rains clear,
The freezing wind will sweep the cosmos.
My travel gear: straw sandals,
A flowering staff always at hand.
Onward, heedless of distance,
Daily needs met as they come.
We vowed to share the finest spots of Western Hills—
But will my two elder brothers truly agree?

---

**Seeing Off Daoist Fan to the Court in the Spring of Guichou**

Though we met but months ago,
Your gentle words were still rare.
Now we part again,
As you rein your sleek steed and set forth.
Late spring in the northern lands,
Willows sway softly on their own.
Swiftly you head northwest,
Dark dust swirling behind your horse.
A mere foot from heaven,
Your heart must not betray the rain-bringing vow.
Lifting my gaze to the bright moon,
Its light shines equally on ten thousand homes.
Old as I am, dwelling among springs and rocks,
I await your return in brocade robes.

**Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One: Seven-Character Regulated Verse**

**Seven-Character Regulated Verse**

**In Praise of the Dao**

**In Praise of the Dao**

Vast and boundless, the divine radiance fills the Great Void,
Its high and profound governance sets the primal beginning.
It embraces the cosmos, nothing lies beyond its reach,
Yet enters the finest hair-tip, its light ever abundant.
All phenomena revolve through creation and transformation,
Grass emerges and vanishes by its breath.
Yet the natures of things permit no exchange of tidings—
Beast and bird, plant and fish, each abides in its own way.

**Celebrating Long Spring**
Mists unfurl, revealing a thousand mountains and ten thousand leagues of clear sky,
The celestial realm brims with spring, its qi overflowing.
Dewdrops glisten in flower hearts, free from worldly cares,
Willow eyes open to the wind, untouched by mortal passions.
The young wander lost in boundless wastes,
While old immortals gather, pledging Penglai and Yingzhou.
Seated, we drain cups of jade-green wine, joy knows no end—
Drunk, we ride cloud-chariots homeward, tipped and careening.

**Begging for a Paper Quilt**
This form, upright as a hanging wart,
Sees through the original truth—all things come to rest.
Call it ox or horse, it answers not;
Bid it seek fowl or hound, it knows no desire.
A single gourd suffices for sustenance, life’s needs are met,
A hundred patches clothe the body, the year’s provisions complete.
Yet still I beg a paper quilt from the lord’s gate—
On cold nights in my snail-shell hut, I sit wrapped to the head.

**Having Long Wished to Make a Paper Quilt, Now at Last It Is Done**
Soft and fine, layered like tender creek vines,
Self-made, its green silk lining fresh as new.
By day, it rolls up wild clouds, motionless in flight;
By night, it drapes the river moon, its light boundless.
Its plain simplicity befits its purpose, far from vulgar craft,
Its warmth, drawn from yang’s harmony, rivals spring’s embrace.
Old age’s chills demand the aid of fire’s strength—
On a low bed by a withered desk, it companions my idle self.

**Awakening from Delusion**
Pure essence once scattered, now thinned and dissipated,
Adrift and lost, whither does one wander?
Who governs seeing, hearing, eating, and rest?
Clinging without return, one wearies in vain.
To cast a Sui pearl at a sparrow—what folly!
The taker scorns it; the seeker prizes it.
When shall one discern that self and ox are not two?
White clouds are trodden, the imperial realm’s return.

**Again**
Hoarding gold and silk invites one’s own blame,
Scattering tiles and pebbles averts no calamity.
Jade refines and polishes, grinding stones to dust;
Pearls emerge from night’s glow, split from the clam’s womb.
To hide oneself, one need not shun the deep and remote—
External things are known to come of themselves.
Yet how can one trust this report?
The mystery’s gate and spear—how could they open?

**Weary of Abbotship**
Leaving home, one enters the Daoist’s household,
Exchanging worldly robes for the cold iron of the *khakkhara*.
Having awakened to illusion’s hues as no true form,
How can one bear, with ailing eyes, to recognize empty flowers?
Less agile than the leopard of Southern Mountain,
More confined than the frog in the well—true poet indeed!
Better to lean on a staff for ten idle years,
Wandering waters and clouds, boundless in delight.

**For Guo Ziyuan on His Northward Journey, Written in Tongzhou**
This parting marks the first stretch from Yan Mountain,
The icy waters of Dichen send you on your way.
The Daoist simplifies affairs, yet they multiply;
Facing guests, he seems heartless, yet feels deeply.
The keyhole fits but holds the wedge—
From here, the roc beats the wind, soaring on its journey.
The spirit roams the eight limits without end—
Who knows when we shall meet again in Jade Capital?

**Auspicious Snow**
The earth’s every fine detail, all things void,
The vast sky stretches endlessly, a single vast expanse.
Night congeals, cold immerses the plum’s soul and moon;
Dawn brushes lightly, stirring the sash of wind.
Life and world shift beyond the dust’s bounds,
Heaven and earth are gathered into the jade pot.
The empty hall’s auspicious herbs merge with the jade forest,
Weighing down Penglai’s foremost peak.

**Sleeping**
The mountain of form lies toppled, eyelashes entwined,
At the ear’s edge, the world’s clamor rages unheeded.
Lost in profound oblivion, forgetting the master’s reproach,
How would it know the disciple’s scorn?
What hinders the dream-fish from swimming the marshlands?
No harm in becoming a butterfly, flitting among flower branches.
That single spark of wakeful clarity—
All realms, all directions, nothing it does not embrace.

**Mid-Autumn**
The dusty world cannot resolve its sorrows,
So hand in hand, we ascend the southern tower.
What joy does the Daoist find at midnight?
Sitting in clarity, gazing upward, wandering inwardly.
Suddenly, beyond heaven and earth, all is luminous and pure,
The great thousand worlds’ finest details gathered in.
Vast and free, self and things forgotten—
The true realm, true joy, endless.

**The Moon Veils Its Light**
All sounds hush in autumn’s bold qi,
Wandering clouds thin, the sky stretches high.
Yu’s tower and Yuan’s isle offer no delight—
Leaning on the oar, pausing the cup, gazing in vain.
The moon, round and bright, remains ever thus;
When veiled by mist, its light is fittingly obscured.
Human life is but an inn for things—
Joy and sorrow come and go, inescapable.

**Dream and Awakening**
Now they speak of last night’s dream,
Last night’s dreamers now speak.
Speakers and dreamers—are they not all I?
Why then distinguish between waking and dreaming?
As a butterfly or a cicada, things transform—
As if pulling a nail or prying a wedge.
A single thought turns the mechanism—dream and waking empty,
Spiritual clarity pierces through kalpas of dust and sand.

**A Rare Encounter**
A meeting once in ten thousand ages, like dawn and dusk,
A thousand leagues away, the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.
The two luminaries flicker past like a galloping colt,
The parched earth’s weeds scatter like drifting catkins.
Awareness and emotion briefly part, like cloud and mud,
Thoughts and cares just divide, entangling self and things.
Through the ages, right and wrong are all inverted—
In dreams, who has leisure to snatch at their own head?

**Sitting Alone**
Awakening from dreams—who is Zhou, who the butterfly?
Riding a crane or girding gold—let none debate.
Enduring neighbors: pine and stone,
Vast and bright friends: moon and cloud.
Crows call, wind carries the celestial melody,
Mountain hues and stream lights reveal earth’s patterns.
The true realm, serene beyond worldly affairs—
No need to seek again the White Prime Lord.

**Losing the Self**
The Daoist dwells where there is no dwelling,
The great function’s full mechanism meets all encounters.
With intent, one observes the face yet fails to meet—
Losing the self, conduct and speech lose their way.
*Chu ci* summons the soul, but the soul does not return,
Profit and fame—best to keep them at a distance.
The floating yang, like sesame and millet, swirls—
Chasing the drum’s beat is no true mechanism.

**Self-Reflection**
The numinous wind stirs the lofty—what constancy?
Returning the light, every household preserves its radiance.
Before the formless cliff, lush auspicious grasses thrive,
On the unbudding branch, true fragrance lingers.
Fire-pears and flame-jujubes are no other things,
Mighty phoenixes and benevolent qilins bring their own blessings.
The golden key and jade lock open freely—
Water and clouds, faintly recalling the land of water and clouds.

**The Void’s Substitution**
Ants and clams know not the snail’s retreat,
The locust altar’s emptiness invites frost’s encroachment.
Mountains and rivers show you the emptiness of rise and fall,
Sun and moon, east and west, endure from ancient times.
Gain and loss cease not, turning like a hand’s palm,
Right and wrong have no fixed form, bound to love and hate.
Who has eyes as vast as a cartwheel?
At a glance, all empty flowers sink into oblivion.

**Deluded Mind**
In dreams and illusions, dawn follows dusk,
In the arena of fame and profit, right blends with wrong.
So much ado—why not return?
The axe at the brow, though moved by feeling, fells itself,
The adze at the nose, though formless, for whom is it swung?
When will the siege of sorrow be breached?
Turn the wheel of the Profound Mystery to set the mechanism aright.

**First Appointment at Changchun Abbey**
Now I’ve outlasted the weeds of Fan and Lai,
The pot is broken, the kitchen bare, not even rice remains.
Leaning on my staff, I grimace at the desolation,
Entering the gate, I stifle laughter at the fools.
Arranging delicate matters for livelihood,
Pointing to emptiness as the only need.
Not clinging to a single thread, I sit in idle repose—
Where else could I seek the robe and pearl?

**Former Reclusion**
My rustic heart recalls only the gleam of the forest,
Staff and sandals treading the soft green at every turn.
My gaze stretches wide, unobstructed by things,
My ears are cleansed, hearing only the pure, far from dust.
Beyond the distant hedge, flowers and trees speak of new grains,
Coarse rice and salted greens follow the old ways.
Year after year, day after day, with nothing to do—
Yet better than Peng soaring into the azure void.

**Reception**
How can a small vessel hold the turbid and the clear?
Human sentiment pushes and pulls, forcing compliance.
Walking upright, I turn my back on the god of wealth,
Sitting in stillness, I let the starving ghosts take hold.
How could I bear to offer sweet wine as a parting gift?
Coming and going, they demand clarity sharper than ice.
I bid you examine the ever-abiding—
The old vine west of the hut remains unharmed.

**Worldly Sentiment**
Crying crows and fragrant blossoms all belong to spring,
In their midst, every form is imbued with the divine.
Lofty and lowly, wriggling and creeping, shift with the times,
Sparrows and eagles, hawks and doves, follow new transformations.
Worldly ways are all topsy-turvy,
The passions of things roll on, sprawling and chaotic.
Dust and haze shroud the morning market—
All see gold, none see the man.

**Visiting a Friend**
A heart of iron and stone in a puppet’s body,
With sincerity and discernment, I seek my kindred.
Wielding the adze to remove the whitewash—hard to refine,
Forging the furnace to restore the heavens—not yet true.
Human affairs cling to delusion, bewitched by illusions,
Worldly sentiment toys with spirits like a puppet master.
In the wondrous moment of meeting, no words are spoken—
Even in old age, one must still break the wheel oneself.

**As Before**
Trying to wield the phoenix knife to emulate the ox-carver,
Worldly sentiment pushes and pulls against the current.
Though I know I’ve escaped the snares of the dusty world,
How could I willingly become a prisoner of wood and earth?
The sword is lost, the boat drifts far,
The banner is raised by the sea, but the father is hard to find.
Every thought is overturned,
See through the green emptiness—all things cease.

**Last Words**
Understanding and explanation boast without restraint,
Half a lifetime like a hive of clamoring bees.
The demon of letters stirs the heart’s banner into chaos,
The itch for skill sharpens the tongue’s root to madness.
Who grasps the plantain to catch the deer?
Knowing the stakes are held, yet the sheep is forgotten.
Alas! What is the use of so much talk?
Shatter the knot of doubt, emulate the sealed bag.

**Sealing the Mouth**
Fortunate to escape the dusty snares and worldly nets,
Yet pitiful to still be ensnared by the demons of sages and worthies.
So much still lingers in the heart’s chamber,
Vast and empty, it churns like waves on paper.
Having awakened, it is no different from the threefold sorrow,
Only then do I know there is yet a realm of nothingness.
From now on, I shall curl my tongue and seal my mouth,
Preserve qi, perfect spirit, and nurture the Great Harmony.

**Assuming the False**
A leather sack with two legs roams east and west—
Who in the void could claim lordship?
Driving the hundred bones through the nine orifices,
Six ghosts arise, three worms grow.
A mass of flesh and bone, illusory from the start,
Ten thousand mechanisms, utterly empty to the core.
Even if the original true self remains,
When admonished, the ears turn deaf as if struck.

**The Mechanism of Transformation**
The mechanism of transformation renews itself moment by moment,
In the dream of the ant’s realm and the Jambu world, this body resides.
Rare to meet a friend who transcends life and death,
Weary of hearing the clamor of those chasing fame and profit.
In Huayang, the idle beast returns unmet,
In the Qi era, the broken wheel is sent in vain.
Illusory world, illusory body, illusory delusion—
Only the false can be, never the true.

**Inheriting the Light**
Passing the torch to continue the flame requires rekindling,
The elixir furnace’s embers gleam like ice.
The sea of awakening welcomes the new moon’s fullness,
The sky of nature again hosts auspicious clouds.
Within the pot, no idle flowers or grasses are sown,
Beyond things, there is no old vine.
The supreme principle is attained from the true and real—
Do not let heart and mouth fall out of accord.

**Cultivation**
Where is cultivation most intimate?
In purity and non-action, attaining the original true.
The wondrous principle has been complete since the beginning,
When illusory dust is swept away, the primordial chaos is restored.
The numinous root flourishes, manifesting in due time,
The great function fully reveals itself, renewed day by day.
If you seek attainment on one side,
In the end, it is but illusion, unrelated to the self.

**Purifying the Heart**
The heart’s field—thorns and brambles cut away, leveled,
Fire-pears and flame-jujubes grow as twin trees.
The numinous thing is inherently whole, lacking nothing,
Empty flowers fade, clarity emerges of itself.
Like a pearl, like a mirror—round and still,
Like jade, like ice—pure and clear.
Do not say the Profound Mystery cannot be transmitted—
The living mechanism appears to man in due time.

**Non-Contention**

**Quelling Demons and Stillness**

Demons of the grass bind their heads, the heart’s warfare ceases,
A thousand gates and ten thousand doors celebrate Great Peace.
On a fine night, clouds disperse and the moon shines white,
In this sagely age, seas are calm and rivers run clear.
A perfect victory—dreaming of the land of Huaxu,
No need to debate time’s constraints in the mustard-seed city.
Pure contention is inherently unchanging, indestructible,
The precious pearl embraces the radiance of Great Light.

*End of Scroll One of Cloud Mountain Collection*
*Scroll Two of Cloud Mountain Collection—Seven-Character Regulated Verse*
*Composed by Zhenren Ji Zhizhen, the Knower of the Constant*

**Contentiousness**
On the mountain of self and others, each claims a peak,
Myriad summits block the path, jagged as fangs.
Dust seals the ancient road, no way back,
Mist locks the numinous source, never reaching home.
Who would bind the heart like a tethered tiger?
Only those who glare like croaking frogs.
A single hair’s touch sparks the heart’s warfare,
Leaving corpses strewn like hemp in chaos.

**Following the Current**
Drifting along the stream, sitting upright on a starry raft,
Awakening to the numinous source—this is home.
Scriptures and verse-satchels, idle playthings,
The medicine furnace and elixir tripod, an old man’s livelihood.
The Daoist of Clear Stream invites the bright moon,
The Master of White Stone reclines in emerald haze.
Face to face, the three beneficial friends forget all,
One scroll of autumn waters, one cup of tea.

**Dwelling in the Mountains**
A towering boulder serves as a precious seat,
Soft moss in abundance replaces green felt.
Cloud cliffs and moonlit grottoes array their secluded wonders,
Wind spirits and mountain deities aid the Dharma feast.
Stream waters and lush forests all expound the Dao,
Wildflowers and flying birds all penetrate the Mystery.
In an instant, one reaches the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever,
No need for words—all are immortals.

**Vulgar Customs**
Whose chickens and dogs roam freely, knowing their quest?
A stubborn heart refuses to be reined in.
The ear-moon is enslaved by sound and form,
The bodily frame is ever a prisoner of profit and fame.
Like woodcutters, they fight over a deer’s share,
Too lazy to follow the butcher’s art of dismembering oxen.
Right and wrong are inverted without pause,
The cycle of birth and death—when will it end?

**Probing the Mystery**
Chewing through the profound mystery, all things are real,
Golden flowers emerge from water, pure and dustless.
The scenery of the celestial pot changes moment to moment,
The clouds and rosy mists of grotto-heavens renew every instant.
Karmic conditions and transformations are but illusory forms,
The message of the primordial beginning communicates with the divine.
The grasses and trees of the forest make no distinctions—
Only the true person among men is genuine.

**Lost at Home**
Weak and adrift, the path grows ever more errant,
Like a cicada molting, one never returns home through the ages.
Sandalwood and locust—this fleeting life is like crawling maggots,
The battles of the ant clans in Jambudvīpa are like snail wars.
Sound and form cling, thick as honey,
Right and wrong churn, tangled as hemp.
Who can rouse the soaring ambition to transcend the heavens,
Leaping from the sea of delusion onto the moonlit raft?

**Walking Alone**
Breaking through the profound mystery, gaining freedom to gather and release,
Every hair and brow soars through the heavens.
Forgotten beyond the world, seeking neither chickens nor dogs,
Yet obediently answering to the calls of horses and oxen.
Wielding the axe with skill, never striking the nose,
Unmoved by emotion, even when rice is scattered before him.
On a vast night of white moon and clear wind,
A single leaf of a boat drifts upon rivers and seas.

**Savoring the Real**
Pure contention, non-action—the body of the wondrous mystery,
A single hair’s rise defiles the heart’s field.
Raising the brows brings a flurry of affairs,
Opening the mouth clearly falls into duality.
Those who sit like blocks of wood are equally burdened,
How many are entangled by kudzu vines?
Gathering heads to put on airs—what is the point?
Seeing through it all, none of it is worth a penny.

**The Dullness of Form**
From the primordial beginning, cast into this prison of form,
Endlessly toiling, never a moment’s rest.
Playing with bones and sinews, displaying strength,
Tossing dust about, hawking from what tower?
Amid the thicket of right and wrong, ever opening the mouth,
Before the mountain of self and others, ever thrusting the head forward.
Only when the nose’s breath can no longer be blown,
Will the skull rest content in the desolate mound.

**Toilsome Life**
Superfluous growths and dangling warts—great afflictions of the body,
From the start, mistakenly taken as real.
Poverty presses urgently, no respite,
Wealth and honor demand ceaseless scheming.
In the arena of fame and profit, one adds vigor,
On the path of private deceit, one expends spirit.
In the end, what does it all become?
How bitterly you are toyed with at the crucial moment!

**Heterodox Views**
Baiting the hook to lure the leviathan—never seen it work,
Yet time and again, they swallow the hook like fledgling birds.
Like duckweed on water, content to drift,
Like falling catkins, easily swayed by the wind.
Eyes diseased, they mistake the real for the false,
Minds deranged, they turn goodness into demons.
Long-held delusions are hard to reverse,
Even those who return may aid the overgrown sprouts.

**True Virtue**
The moment a thought arises, ghosts and spirits know,
The original good heart cannot be deceived.
Aiding beings and benefiting life, forgetting gain and loss,
Yielding to others, acting with humility.
Private deceit and arrogance are routinely dispelled,
Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and compassion rise and descend.
Reverent, sincere, without flattery or crookedness,
Where in heaven and earth would one not be fitting?

**Worldly Entanglements**
Engaging in debates, distinguishing east and west—what merit is there?
This heart cannot align with worldly sentiments.
Jade-like nectar speaks of stillness, yet none understand,
Muddy wine and clamor create their own thickets.
Adornments attract flies to swarm,
The empty boat, loosely moored, drifts on boundless waters.
Orchids and angelicas remain unruffled, unseen by others,
Yet their pure fragrance still brushes the evening breeze.

**Self-Concealment**
Letting all matters rest, feigning foolishness,
Utmost sincerity alone accords with the Dao.
The precious pearl of the mystery must be sealed tightly,
Rare herbs and jade flowers bloom late.
The elixir is refined, yet none recognize it,
Where the talisman flies, even ghosts cannot spy.
The Dharma-body merges with the realm of empty space,
Its wondrous function is clear—no doubt remains.

**Imitative Dharma**
Erecting images to clarify the real only obscures it,
Dim and dull eyes add more dust.
From this, paintings and carvings veil the mystery,
When will clay and wood reveal the Dharma-body?
Illusions arise from conditions, deceiving the world,
Cunning devices secretly ensnare people.
Talking of gods and ghosts—errors fill the heavens,
Unafraid of Yama, the Lord of the Underworld, beware!

**Doctrinal Nets**
Entering the gate, one wears an iron bridle,
Led here and there, never free.
Restrained solely by our teachings and precepts,
Sealed off, not permitted to seek beyond.
Heaven is but a vain hope, a lure for blessings,
Hell a hollow threat, a tale of woe.
Over time, one becomes a ghostly exemplar,
Bewitched by demons and delusions until death.

**Chasing the Times**
The gates of the powerful are like the sea, I am but a fish,
Behind each high curtain, I hasten to follow.
Mouths mumble, hearts constrict,
Bodies crane their necks, feet tiptoe.
Esteeming the Dao and honoring virtue—this is delusion,
The net of vulgar customs and worldly dust is the true snare.
Originally abandoning home—what was the aim?
Reflecting, all efforts were utterly misguided.

**Vulgar Thoughts**
The bitter sea of worldly cares stretches boundless,
Trivial passions of mortals all topsy-turvy.
Truth and falsehood blur beyond discernment,
Right and wrong confound—who can unravel?
The whole city hails madness as sagacity,
The land sees rectitude as perversity.
Once self-interest is prized, who dares defy?
When shall the lotus bloom in fire?

**Distracted Mind**
Poverty whines while wealth grows wanton,
Restless feet scurry for more than enough.
Every move feigns virtue, every step a lie,
Each act a ploy, each scheme more cunning.
No thought for fairness, kindness, or mercy,
Only greed and lust for gain fill the heart.
Evil accumulates beyond measure—
Sudden calamity strikes without warning.

**Deluded Deeds**
Chiseling away at heaven’s truth, all goes awry,
Daily, deceit multiplies unnoticed.
Idle spirits and wayward ghosts vie to deceive,
Walking corpses and animated bones become demons.
Harming others to profit oneself, traps are set,
Grasping at life, coveting things, nets are spread.
Burdens of sin borne in vain—
When retribution comes, what then?

**Reading Scriptures**
Knowing scriptures beats ignorance,
Yet even the learned become laughable.
Mouths chew words idly,
When do hearts ever pause to ponder?
Self and others, right and wrong only grow,
Greed and deceit—will they ever be cast aside?
The one crucial insight remains obscured,
What use are these *zhi-hu-zhe-ye*?

**Dimming Brilliance**
Not that brilliance must be shattered into stupidity,
But brilliance fears its own confusion.
Elegant phrases and polished words—easily grasped,
But pure clarity and perfect brightness—who attains?
Most flaunt their wit on the tongue,
Few apply effort to the heart’s ground.
When shall the cosmos settle and heaven’s light dawn?
Only then will emptiness and stillness reveal the Dao’s pivot.

**The Mundane**
Anxious grasping, envy, greed, and self-interest,
Heedless of peril, all is pursued.
Strength wanes, influence fades—no proof remains,
Disaster strikes, misfortune arises—no control.
Invoking spirits, dancing shamans,
Consulting talismans, befriending healers.
Incense burns, a fleeting show of piety,
Yet the whole household follows blindly.

**Intoxicated Heart**
The Daoist drinks the elixir’s sweet spring,
Not the yellow wine that drowns in folly.
Not the Six Classics’ profound depths,
But the Three Essentials’ mystery of mysteries.
Fame’s hook darts—fish swallow the bait,
Profit lures east and west, craving rank stench.
Drunk on ten thousand hues, all forgotten—
Only the lone moon ascends the jade sky.

**Utter Poverty**
Brilliance dimmed, the nature’s heaven lies bare,
Eons of dust and passion—all dissected.
From this, the body stands naked, bones exposed,
No longer ensnared by illusions’ tangled roots.
The cowherd sees not where the man has gone,
The ground is utterly empty—even a cone finds no place.
Poverty pushed to its utmost, poverty ceases—
The living impulse released: is it not I?

**Following the True**
Long have habits bound, greed run rampant,
The heart’s turmoil—endless suffering.
The true command issues, falsehoods flee,
A glimmer of real work—Dao may be grasped.
Lifetimes of knowing the thief, yet wandering north,
Kalpas of lost directions, minds pointing south.
Life after life, chewing bitter coptis,
Yet the first taste of milk-sugar brings sweetness.

**True Practice**
Begin with humility, ever more humble,
A level heart, one’s duty—naturally pure.
Aiding others, meeting all with kindness, no lapse,
Harmonizing principle, illuminating truth—both embraced.
Let no illusions or sorcery startle the world,
No strange tricks deceive the ears of the crowd.
Deeply accumulate virtue and deeds—
The highest mechanism needs no grasping.

**True Work**
Seek not Southern Peak or Heavenly Terrace,
Empty names and forms—all dismissed.
Wealth and desire forgotten, the heart steadies,
Right and wrong dissolved, the nature’s heaven opens.
Sincerity and stillness—action without question,
Impartiality and compassion—virtue complete.
Outer conduct and inner work both cultivated,
The radiant, perfect Lotus Throne attained.

**Liu Fu’s Daughter’s Grief**
Creation, heartless, toys with us,
Laughter turns to grief unnoticed.
The Flower Keeper conjures a perfect beauty,
Brewing a decade’s joyous dream.
The dream shatters—emptiness alone remains,
Yet all efforts are spent adorning the fair one’s departure.
Threads snap, echoes fade—each returns home,
A life left dangling in a hollow deception.

**Dissolving into Emptiness**
Creation’s tricks—none recognize,
Its shifting wonders—who truly knows?
Lightning-fast mechanisms, impossible to guard,
The dark path ahead—black as lacquer.
A hand’s turn—life and death, rise and fall,
Morning four, evening three—sevenfold inversion.
Joy and sorrow arise unbidden—
A mass of illusion mistaken for reality.

**Wind and Waves**
Wind and waves stir easily, grudges and favors,
Ingrained habits hard to forget—brewing joy and sorrow.
Through the ages, right and wrong never cease,
A lifetime of self and others—endless strife.
Heroes ensnared by fame and achievement,
Heroes imprisoned by profit and desire.
The great cause and conditions—unheeded,
All day, fretting for others.

**Establishing Transformation**
Original truth is not form, form is not truth,
The gate of transformation—all dust.
In dust, who can open the true path?
Amid things, who reveals the whole self?
Unbinding the withered, loosening bonds—few,
Transcending the common, surpassing the crowd—how many?
Knowing one’s practice is not of great capacity,
Best to remain still and nurture the spirit.

**Residing in the Monastery**
Endless clamor of greetings and farewells,
Human affairs—exhausting restraint.
Disciples shoulder burdens, iron willow baskets,
The monastery’s gate—a stylish prison.
A single lapse in vigilance—heart turns vulgar,
Gathering clods, bathing in mud.
Ashamed, the west wind blows with force,
Scattered clouds drift, clinging to cliffs and valleys.

**Discussing Scriptures**
Probing scriptures as a ladder to heaven,
Plucking yellow leaves to quiet a child’s cry.
After rain, lotuses rise from water,
In wind, willow fluff clings to mud—how joyful!
How can a mole aspire to chariots and horses?
Has the roc ever delighted in drums and gongs?
Vulgar songs of the lowlands become custom,
Yet singing the *Yangchun* only deepens doubt.

**Self-Bondage**
Born, yet unaware of emptiness,
Spears and halberds grind, filling the chest.
Not the sea’s depths plumbed to the bottom,
Nor the mountain’s peaks scaled to their heights.
Delusion’s rope binds—three thousand coils,
Dharma’s net imprisons—ten thousand layers.
Longing to escape the cave of birth and death,
Who would follow an old man’s lead?

**Dharma Forms**
Grandiose dharma forms spread wide,
All alike—lost sheep, valleys and storehouses.

Amid the cycle of birth and death, vainly emerging and vanishing,
On the path of names and words, endlessly haggling like merchants.
Burning incense, stirring embers to welcome them home,
Beating drums, tolling bells to perform upon the stage.
With such craving for fame and gain still unquelled,
How can one become a king within the Dharma?

**Altar Grounds**
Heads gather, crafting illusions to ensnare one another,
So skillfully deceiving the foolish, leaving them in the dust.
Playing false as true, turning truth into delusion,
Making nothing into something—what merit lies therein?
Pointing at emptiness, drawing emptiness—yet what is truly gained?
Clinging to the real, upholding the real—still trapped in the midst.
Displaying countless idle tricks and ploys,
Transforming others unawares, yet blinding and deafening themselves.

**Unaccomplished**
The kalpa’s turning grinds away, evil ever shifting,
How many have ever woven the green threads of good causes?
The fire pit roasts the body, flames leaping higher,
The bitter sea swells boundlessly, waves merging with the sky.
Some raise their poles, rushing toward the shallows,
How many strike the oars, drifting in fishing boats?
Where now is the old man of years past?
No trace remains of the rainbow hook dangling its bait.

**Awakening to Reality**
To sever the hanging tumor, cast off the sack of suffering,
Amid the dust-heaps of ten thousand defilements, simply turn the light inward.
Layer upon layer of habits from many lives, sweep them all away,
Through kalpas of selfish wrongs, let envy and longing fade.
Not clinging to a single thread, the form remains unobstructed,
Inheriting the ancient majesty, the countenance resplendent.
In the realm of eternal spring, the scenery wondrous,
Jade trees and coral groves bloom in perfect order.

**Embracing Poverty**
A thatched hut is but a temporary abode, not the true reality,
What hindrance is there in a bell suspended in empty walls?

**Breaking Free**
This man alone can slip the nets,
His heart unwilling to sink in the depths.
What are these heaps of kindling and clods?
Jade disks and gold—mere tiles and pebbles in his sight.
All illusions, one stroke to erase,
Revealing at last the true and unerring mark.

**Dharma-Body**
The positionless true person, form like emptiness,
Things arise unceasing—response in an instant.
Unfurling the treasure-store, heaven and earth grow narrow,
Releasing the perfect radiance, sun and moon both attend.
Vast and minute, coarse and fine—all contained herein,
Being and non-being, high and deep—none but myself.
The boundless sands of worlds stretch to the farthest reaches,
Yet in an instant, all gathered into a millet-grain pearl.

**Beyond Forgetting**
The ancient Dao-ground, fully adorned,
Life-restoring magic herbs, soul-returning incense.
The entire Dharma-realm’s treasury, the true realm,
Yet our school’s light remains unreleased.
Yao’s right and Jie’s wrong—both indistinct,
Crane’s length and egret’s shortness—both forgotten.
Great Peace bears no form, yet every household meets it,
Sweeping the sleeves, one returns to the land of drunkenness.

**Free from the Hub**
Clear in dreams, awake in drunkenness,
Within and without, the same pure savor remains.
Every affair brushed aside, true principle suffices,
Dust upon dust cleansed, the Dharma-body light.
A cracked gourd for daily use, hunger spurs the search,
A burrowed den for winter dwelling, warmth comes after.
Not bound in the world’s snares and coils,
Freely and idly passing this life.

**Worldly Entanglements**
Amid the heaps of ten thousand dusts, gladly shouldering the burden,
Clothes must be sharp and new, food must be sweet.
Expenses weigh on the mind, deep calculations,
Seeking satisfaction, greed draws one on.
Fame’s snare—self-made, like a bird in a cage,
Profit’s bonds—self-forged, like a flea’s leap.
Taking idle sorrows for joy,
Unknowing, one’s whole life becomes a malady.

**The Net of Doubt**
Knowing all dharmas arise from mind,
Why seek the mind outside?
The cinnabar is self-possessed—seek and gain it,
Who makes the monkey and horse their own captors?
Ghostly faces and demonic masks, swiftly cast off,
Strange nearness and wild traces, suddenly submerged.
The great refining furnace never tempered,
Yang’s ashes will never yield gold.

**Seeking the Mountains**
Alas! A stubborn nature loves to seek the mountains,
Yet upon reaching them, one recalls the return.
Bowing and rising on slopes, the burden heavy,
Struggling up steep steps, weary of the climb.
Bears and hungry tigers lurk nearby,
Woodcutters and hunters knock at dusk’s gate.
How much better to stand firm as jade, the mind settled,
Upright and at ease, wherever one may be.

**Wandering Immortals in the Human World**
Trusting one’s steps, climbing to gather the true,
Following the traces of Gonghe, neighbor to Crane Mountain.
The land of the Dao belongs to cloud and mist,
This remote place knows no dust of carriages and horses.
Beneath the rocks, a sacred spring, cold moon’s reflection,
Before the hall, ancient cypresses, spring’s hidden glow.
The thatched hut calls the mountain boy—ask him:
“Is there still one who summons the wind with a long whistle?”

**Visiting the Five Peaks**
Five peaks stand like walls, arrayed in mountain faces,
Cave palaces deep, encircled by layered verdure.
Canopies stretch wide, the Jade Chamber hangs,
Stone gates, secluded, lead to the mysterious pass.
Things pass through kalpas—where have the people gone?
People depart to court the origin—cranes have not returned.
The noble conduct once heard—only traces remain,
A sky of bright moon, the Whistling Terrace at ease.

**Laying Down the Hook**
White duckweed, red reeds—how many autumns?
Hungry golden carp never rise to the hook.
Cloud-bait, arrow-sack—vainly kept secret,
The rainbow rod put away, best to rest.
Li Zhu’s eyes fail to measure, gazing south,
Mad Qu’s words falter, knowing the northern journey.
A thousand fathoms of surging waves, the vast sea,
A sky of bright moon, one empty boat.

**Auspicious Signs on a Warm Day**
The courtyard’s morning brings fine auspices,
Fortune and longevity silently added to your house.
The illusory world of men—recognized in time,
The true wind beyond things—praised this day.
The jade flask of life-preservation gathers crimson snow,
The golden crucible of longevity refines cinnabar.
Willing to come and drink on the Dark Continent,
Sitting to watch the peach blossoms bloom again and again.

**A Chance Encounter**
Awakening from dull, drowsy meditation,
A wine-fly shatters the sky within the jar.
Boundless realms, so vast,
The great liberation’s mechanism—wondrous, untransmitted.
By water, near mountains—new undertakings,
Favorable winds, bright moon—old causes green.
Before one’s eyes, grasses and trees all speak the principle,
Crickets’ autumn chirps—night’s discourse on the profound.

**Self-Reproach**
Creation clearly toys with this skin-sack,
Yet still I cling to the arena of profit and fame.
In later years, unrestrained chatter,
Good flesh idly carved, self-inflicted wounds.
Beneficial friends meet and part, spewing joy and sorrow,
This illusory body moves and stops—a dream’s drifting.
The world’s itches and disturbances make peace impossible,
I recall the deep hiding place among white clouds.

**Double Ninth on Jade Flower Isle**
On the ninth day of the ninth month in Yan Mountain, meeting friends,
Staff and sandals wander Jade Flower Isle.
Overgrown paths, marked branches, threading ancient caves,
Precipices, leaning on rocks, gazing toward the divine continent.
Ancient pines, old wutong trees—desolate in the sun,
Red leaves, yellow flowers—subtle autumn’s glow.
One matter untroubled, deep interest spent,
Turning to seek the return path, oars of a light boat.

**Farewell to Elder Jinpo**
Parting words in haste, ice and snow cold,
Like horses turning their heads toward Western Mountain.
In the basket, talismans and registers just transmitted,
In the sleeves, Kun and Wu—how could they be idle?
Just like last year’s departure from the palace,
Again today, arriving among men.
Affectionate ties resolved, heart’s matters settled,
Seizing the east wind, reverently approaching the imperial gate.

**Seeing Zhang Wenshu Off to Helin**
Governance is the great way of heaven’s thoroughfare,
Sun slow, wind warm, horses’ hooves light.
Northward journey to the Dark Waters, messages flow,
Green mountains arrayed, ready to send and welcome.
I too delve into obscure searches, exhausting the mouse’s stratagems,
You should exert strength, soaring like Peng’s flight.
Helin is a footstep from the Son of Heaven’s majesty,
Together we look up to the grace shining on the Jade Capital.

**Same as Above**
Old age brings deep reluctance at parting,
Unworthy, I still compose a farewell poem.
Day clear, wind passes, flowers fly in the sun,
Spring slow, mud softens, swallows speak in verse.
After parting, unbearable to dwell on past wrongs,
Gazing, helpless—soon lost in folly.
Evening clouds, misty waves—each stage distant,
Turning back to seek vows—who can know?

**Seeing He Juchuan Off with the Perfected One to Court**
Crane’s carriage, light and swift, rising from Yan,
Riding the wind straight up to the Hooked Heaven.
Dragon mounds, desert sands—thousands of miles,
Southward plum blossoms, northward journey—half a year.
After parting, who will share a laugh?
In this seat, with whom to speak of the profound?
A lifetime of iron and stone, the liver and bowels break,
Old eyes meet—tears nearly fall.

**Same as Above**
You meet a transcendent, study like Lu Ao,
One leap, soaring clouds—ten thousand fathoms high.

**Departing to Serve the Celestial Court**

Gone now, you ascend to press close by the Emperor’s throne,
Returning here, you take your post among the ranks of immortals.
Your dark merit, vast and subtle, bridges the hidden and the earthly,
Your great shelter’s ripples reach even the old gluttons.
Useless if you fail to aid the world—what worth then?
Yet fit to retire to the groves, drunk on peaches of immortality.

**Musing on the Northern Palace**

Leaning on a blossom-staff, I pace slowly through the palace grounds,
The great transformation’s tide has swept all into the void.
Grass and trees now drink fresh rain and dew,
Pavilions and terraces bear no trace of old cinnabar hues.
Jade steps lie shattered, only remnants of footprints remain,
The marble stairs stand ruined, yet the ancient statutes endure.
Waterbirds, unaware the world has changed,
Still gather at dusk on the sandy shoals.

**Autumn Excursion to Jade-Flower Isle**

High in the Palace of Broad Cold, wildflowers bloom yellow,
Thorns and brambles choke the ancient grotto chambers.
Scattered stones and crumbling walls mark a new realm,
Withered lotus and withered grass fill the old ponds.
Where now the floating clouds of caps and canopies?
Lightning-swift, the mountain boats vanish without trace.
I turn to the west wind to ask for news—
Only the sky-piercing pines stand ever green.

**Same as Above**

On this new autumn, immortals join to seek their pact,
Wind-borne carriages descend lightly from the Great Purity.
Hundred-jeweled dew bathes the moon’s cavern,
Nine-rayed clouds veil the glimpse of Penglai’s isles.
Looking down, the azure vault unfurls like brocade,
Upside-down, jade flowers mirror the crystal waters.
Striding through the Palace of Broad Cold, idly I survey—
How many tread the edges of the Jade Empyrean?

**Recalling the Former Palace**

Layered timbers, clouds massed—Jian Zhang’s halls rise,
A long march of captives, yet the golden ramparts stood firm.
Fermented into the force of tribal strife and whale-like conquest,
Transformed into the battleground of sandalwood and silk.
One night’s palace flames left only embers,
A hundred years of men now lie in frozen waste.
I ponder the clamor of those days of splendor—
Who would believe the west wind leaves the grass unyellowed?

**Western Flower Garden**

The imperial carriage’s dust settled, never to disperse,
The five-cloud towers and pavilions all turned to ash.
Once, the great enterprise shone a thousand fathoms bright,
Now, a hollow name—just a cup of wine.
The Maker’s mechanisms play their tricks,
The sun-birds race dawn and dusk in vain.
Do the garden’s flowers and grasses still know?
The east wind has been moved to plant elsewhere.

**Lamenting Yanran’s Past**

Gold, like a lost deer, fled the Central Plains,
Unnoticed, the ashes flew from the Five Phoenix Tower.
The palace’s halls and guards became wild grass,
Courtiers and scholars all turned to mounds of sand.
Drums and war horns shattered the dream of Hua Xu,
Clouds and waters first promised a boundless journey.
Now I watch the west wind’s gentle withering—
How many autumns have passed since the red reeds bloomed?

**Mourning Lecturer Hao**

I recall our talks by the Zhang River’s banks,
How grand—now you have returned to your true nature.
Discarding your feathered robe, you first shed the old,
The bright crow soars into empty space, parting to renew.
Dreaming of pacing the Dipper, you wake at dusk in the dusty world,
Treading clouds, you return to the Emperor’s realm in spring.
The jade censer’s yellow threads melt into ash,
Leaving only pure fragrance for those who come after.

**Staying at Five-Flower Mountain**

True immortals have rebuilt Five-Flower Palace,
The mountain’s face, lush and winding, cradles brocade peaks.
Clear springs murmur through the quiet night,
Slender bamboos rustle in the crisp wind.
The land is remote, the scene secluded—all surpasses the hidden,
Human skill and heaven’s work achieve wondrous craft.
I ask where the elixir is refined—
Only the mountain’s towering trees, bathed in evening red.

**True Nature**

To conjecture or describe is already to lose the truth,
The moment it passes the lips, it falls into the dust of roots.
From one source it first arises, yet in every head it is,
Through six gates its light divides, ever renewed each instant.
Round and responsive, the pivot’s wheel—all creation’s mystery,
Stir past the barrier’s bolt, and you yourself become divine.
How many illusions have been made into servants?
Who remains the original master?

**A Guest Shows a Brocade Bag Holding a Phoenix Beak**

Scarcely emerged from the cinnabar mountain, its virtue already wanes,
How much more the lingering taste, recalling its woven nest.
Its five-colored plumage, once heralded—now but an empty tale,
Its nine-fold spirit—where does it reside?
The great tortoise’s shell was split, yet not for its own glory,
The unicorn’s leg was broken—how did it come to this?
The four sacred creatures are no common things,
Yet even they are swept up in the kalpa’s ashes.

**Same as Above**

The living mechanism transmitted, years forgotten,
Now I see the Way of heaven and earth both complete.
Standing firm, our lineage surpasses ten thousand ages,
Round and harmonious, it encompasses the three mysteries.
Vastly it opens the treasure store, free of restraint,
Secretly it aligns the pivot’s wheel, brushing away bias.
It draws the Silver River to roof the heavens,
Auspicious light flashes, guarding Yanran forever.

**Seeing Off the Imperial Censor to Court**

From childhood, you bore the grace of the imperial house,
To mend one flaw—why fear the melon’s swift succession?
Steady, you soar through the crimson empyrean on a roc,
Far, you sit astride the Silver River’s arc.
One day, the golden urn will bear the yellow roof’s name,
At the jade steps, in this fine hour, white hemp will be offered.
All admire the breath that revives the warming winds,
A sky of spring colors spreads over the river’s sands.

**Offering Longevity to the Perfected One of Pure Harmony**

Holding the sun, you open the heavens, descending to the Jade Capital,
A pillar of the Dao’s gate, hero of seas and mountains.
Three thousand cycles of sixty years—you emerge in the world,
Ninety thousand immortals pledge their pact beyond the bounds.
Your life-root stands firm as pine turned to stone,
Your years outstrip mustard seeds filling a city.
Your true form endures through the kalpa’s vastness,
Seated, you watch the Yellow River’s currents clear time and again.

**Celebrating the Ninth of September, Master Yan Zhan**

In plain sandals, you walk with Maid Ma and the Queen Mother,
By chance riding the wind’s carriage to descend to the Central Land.
The peaches of immortality you freely share with Dongfang Shuo,
The fire dates you personally transmit to Xu You’s wanderings.
Fragrant mists and cloud-harmonies fill the pure chamber,
Jade mushrooms and divine herbs grace the banquet of the spirit isles.
In Penglai’s shallow waters, idly you converse and laugh—
How many autumns have passed with red leaves and yellow flowers?

**Seeing Off Lecturer Jia to Dongping**

Wrapped in the fragrance of water caltrop and lotus, I send you on your way,
Your joyful countenance cupped, you depart the Phoenix City.
The warm sun steams, hastening your return,
The balmy wind stirs, your coral robe light.
Startled awake from a three-year dream of your homeland,
You count the twelve stages of your journey.
After parting, east and west, south and north—where will you wander?
When will we meet again to speak of the classics?

**Matching Yang Xi’an’s Rhymes**

The cloud-shouldered gates of the grotto palace remain unopened,
Scattered red rain—spring’s end is near.
Just as the valleys and peaks recover from the breath’s force,
Again the river and sky turn to sleet and snow’s chill.
The wind carries a wrecked boat to the land of ghosts,
Men follow the white donkey to Huai’an’s dream.
Ever has the Maker played like a child—
Best to set it aside, forget, and sigh no more.

**Same as Above**

Darkly I search heaven’s principles, penetrating the subtle,
Worldly affairs, tangled, yet their patterns are easily seen.
Freshly bathed, you shake your robes—all must be taken,
Impatient striving, plucking the zither—only invites ridicule.
At the right time, seize the gap—evil encroaches on the upright,
In creation, scales and fins may yet be made right or wrong.
If only the spirit’s heart could establish the imperial standard,
Then use what is fitting to mend decay, and what is proper to return.

**Seeing Off Peng Zongdao on His Journey North to Study with a Master**
This parting—how can I bear the sorrow welling thick?
You meet a transcendent like Lu Ao, seeking the Way.
The crane, ever mindful, cries out through the hours,
While clouds, heartless, rise ever higher in their course.
To reach far, doubt not—let the steed stretch its stride;
To cleave the ox, fear not—the blade’s edge shines keen.
The master relies on you as hook and line,
To cast upon the ocean’s isles and land the giant turtle.

**Seeing Off Cui Tingyu to Court**
Bamboo and moon, pine and wind—years of companionship,
Now parting in misting plum rains by Yanran’s frontier.
Distant mountains inspire you to idly craft verses,
While desert sands, empty of men, urge the whip on.
Early you mapped great deeds by the Red Waters,
Never lose the old family legacy of the blue felt mat.
When the time comes, ascend the Hall of Brightness,
Ride the phoenix, grasp the unicorn, and ascend to heaven.

**Seeing Off Zhao Zizhen, Presenting the Canon to Court**
I recall our wanderings by Golden Phoenix Terrace,
Gazing from on high, thoughts stretching far and long.
Now we meet again to part by Yan Mountain,
Unexpectedly, the post-horse hurries the farewell.
The sacred canon’s mystic radiance ascends to heaven,
While frontier dust and autumn hues touch my temples.
The homeward date is set—our year-long pact holds:
Let not the cinnabar heart turn to a single inch of ash.

**Mourning Guo Chaoran**
The precious canon’s copies all proved false,
Scattered pages, broken slips—now cloaked in dust.
Startled awake, his noble bearing lingers in memory,
The dream shattered, his spirit’s visage made new.
Too late, the parrot’s wing fades into twilight’s realm,
Steadily rides the spirit-steed to the imperial spring.
Alas, he reaches the Hall of Brightness,
Yet cares not that tears soak my kerchief.

**Seeing Off Master Wang to Court**
Mending heaven, you draw near the Jasper Palace,
Turning the Silver River back—your merit unique.
The crane brings golden missives from the purple courts,
Clouds merge in hues to reveal the azure vault.
Your benevolent influence spreads, reviving the withered,
The stirring winds of kindness dispel all obscurity.
Auspicious signs must be proclaimed in heaven’s realm,
As we watch the roc’s wings once more take the wind.

**Inscribed on the Immortal’s Terrace, at the Tomb of the Man Who Lived While Dead**
The numinous spring’s deep draughts dissolve my lineage’s bonds,
Through kalpas, master and truth share the same face.
Drunken eyes suddenly open—the world grows narrow,
Dream-souls awaken to find sea and mountains void.
Gold and jade gleam, flowers vie in bloom,
Pearls and gems cluster like trees in groves.
I ask the eternal intent of Zhongnan’s peaks—
A hundred rivers, silent, flow eastward as one.

**Seeing Off Attendant Pan to Yongle**
The immortal lord emerges from the Five Bright Halls,
Jade pendants chiming in the wind of imperial guards.
Triple-pure clouds steam white above his head,
Nine-returned elixir binds crimson to his cheeks.
The Great Clarity’s esoteric will—our master’s intent—
Now carries on Lü’s ancestral work.
I envision the moon above Zhongtiao’s peaks,
Its auspicious light suffusing ten thousand homes as one.

**Seeing Off Li Hefu Returning to Qin**
You depart west from Phoenix City,
Lotus robes billowing in the wind, feathered garb light.
A hut of reeds holds heaven and earth in a single heart,
While a hand’s span of clouds and mountains spans a thousand li.
Fortunate to have met, to know your face,
Grievous to part again, our simple bond deep.
The ancestral intent of Zhongnan—you alone grasp it,
Walking alone upon the road to Chang’an.

**Seeing Off Du Tianfu Returning to Zhongnan**
In haste we speak our farewells, thoughts drifting,
Vast the cloud-wrapped mountains, long the road ahead.
Your heart bound to the ancestral court, scorching heat forgotten,
Your steps follow the official willows as the frost thins.
In prosperous times, strive with all your might,
While I, old and indifferent, withdraw in stillness.
Remember the day we parted by the jade hall,
Evening winds lightly stirring the lotus blossoms.

**Mourning Feng Quanxiao**
By the literary grove’s edge, you probed the subtle,
Turning back to the world of men, you saw the dream was false.
The morning dwelling held not your true face,
Yet the living mechanism was ever yours to wield.
A pair of cranes vanished beyond the white clouds,
No short flute now summons the yellow crane home.
Desolate, the old flowers and trees before the tower,
West winds mingle with dew, weeping in the dawn’s glow.

**Seeing Off He Juchuan to the Ancestral Court**
Empty mountains, ceaseless waters flowing,
Cranes lament, gibbons cry—how many years have passed?
Yesterday by the altar, you stood among the egrets’ ranks,
Now in Qin and Long, you claim the turtle’s head.
Before your horse, wind and moon stretch endlessly,
Beneath the crows, passes and rivers mark each autumn.
Once you grasp the single net that spans ten thousand moons,
Lightly ply the living mechanism and return home early.

**Master Zifeng Journeys South**
Heaven and earth seen through as a single lotus hut,
Shifting, never abiding, roaming the great void.
Touching things, dark or bright, he mirrors their shadows,
Among men, bending or rising, he sways like a swing.
The vast ford’s boundless waves bear the mercy-boat,
The ancient way’s rugged path turns the virtue-chariot.
How many follow, gaping in his wake,
As he races beyond the dust to Huaxu’s realm.

**Same as Above**
The master first grasped the truth within,
Once host of Purple Canopy Peak.
His breath summons the single wind that names all sounds,
The solitary moon’s perfect clarity illumines every ford.
Northward, he gazes toward Yan and Ji, where light and dust merge,
Southward, he crosses Liang’s gardens, where grasses and trees renew.
Wherever he goes, no need to blow the warming airs—
With ease, the cold valleys bloom again in spring.

**Laozi Crossing the Pass**
Hoary head, youthful face—a body of transformation,
The blue ox’s faint hoofprints tread the yellow dust.
Moonlight sings over Tianzhu’s streams and mountains at dawn,
Wind sweeps Hangu Pass, renewing grasses and trees.
Straddling past and present, he rides the sun’s chariot,
Entering non-being, emerging from being, he turns the wind’s wheel.
To fathom the wondrous, cast off names and forms—
No brush or ink may capture him for men.

**Mourning Zhang Wenshu, Returning to Truth in the Forest**
The living-fire elixir crucible—his plan came too late,
Wind and clouds idly set aside, no more chanting of poems.
Breaking through the eight poles, his spirit roamed the day,
Piercing the three lives, his dream ended then.
*Chu ci*’s summoning of souls—mere empty words,
*Yue*’s lament for the past—what use is it now?
Only his rotting bones remain beneath the cold forest,
As spring departs and autumn returns, my heart aches with sorrow.

**Seeing Off Master Zuo to Court**
A descendant of Yuanfang through generations,
For years he paced with measured steps to the golden gate.
Just heard the wind’s truth depart the celestial courts,
Now word comes of the starry audience at the imperial throne.
By fate, he aids lords who seek Ji’s teachings,
With power, he calls forth spirits like Liu Gen.
The mountain-burning talismans are ready for use at any time,
To aid the upright and expel evil—look to the supreme one.

**Farewell to Master Zhao Bound for Court**
The post road’s ice and snow stretch long and far,
Parting words hurried over a single cup of wine.
The basket holds feathered talismans, their might ablaze,
The casket guards the spirit-sword, its light flashing.
Sweeping away the mists from the altar, he serves the king,
Driving wind and thunder, he reaches the imperial realm.
Soon we’ll see him blow the mountain ghosts into submission,
No more will they wander, lost and hesitant.

**Mourning Vice Minister Jia of the Celestial Prefecture**
*(Fragment incomplete—no translation provided.)*

**Holding the Reins of Governance**

Firmly grasping the handle of transformation’s mechanism,
Scattered clouds drift—when will the imperial realm’s summons arrive?
In the pillow’s dream, the rooster crows thrice before waking,
Within the scholar-tree’s shade, millet cooks once to completion.
The illusory realm, though wearying, is not without its charms,
Old robes exchanged—what sorrow could there be?
Behold the waxing and waning moon o’er the golden terrace,
Its night-cleansing radiance as bright as before.

**Farewell to Vice Magistrate Li**

The shuttle weaves without cease, hastening west and east,
Rare to meet one with green temples and azure pupils.
Worldly dreams, long or short, are but phantoms,
Human sentiments—are they not all one vast primal chaos?
Beyond yellow dust lies a forest of jade,
Amidst white waves, a towering pillar stands.
Wild clouds emerge from the peaks, drifting without rest,
Now borne by rain, now swept by wind—submitting to neither.

**Elegy for Master Yu the Great**

A master from the Purple Court, a companion of banished immortals,
Yet in the end, he set forth on a boundless journey.
A thousand samadhis mastered within the heart,
Seventy-one years of worldly green—now at rest.
Leaves bright as jade take flight, the mountain cradling the moon,
The flute’s echo lingers o’er Yellow Crane Tower.
Gazing into the vastness of the azure sea,
Scattered clouds drift past the isles of phoenix and qilin.

**Admonition to the World**

Spring departs, autumn arrives—no pause,
The two wheels of time urge on, merciless.
On the snail’s horns, men vie for fame and gain,
In the spark’s flash, life and death are lodged.
The judgments of the Underworld’s clerks cannot be evaded,
The verdicts of Dengdu brook no delay.
A level path lies plain and clear,
Yet why do the deluded refuse to walk it?

**The Heavenly Net**

Vast is the Heavenly Net—none may deceive it,
The dark paths of the underworld are too obscure to know.
Good causes, evil fruits—all shaped by the heart,
Hell and heaven—each fashioned by oneself.
Hungry ghosts and brute beasts, grasping at what they crave,
Drowned souls and stagnant spirits—fools in their nature.
I urge you: seek the way home while there’s time,
For when the limit comes, regret will be too late.

**To an Old Friend in the Southern Palace**

Amidst the clamor of drums and flutes, stepping onto the stage,
Mimicking forms, they scurry in pretense.
Who knows the Creator’s idle sport?
Only to give onlookers cause to gossip.
Their tricks, once displayed, are but a hollow *kharjūra*,
Their schemes seen through—no room for negotiation.
On a moonlit night in the empty hall, the wind still,
Sitting by the warm brazier, a single stick of incense burns.

**As Before**

I laugh at my own long delusion,
Seeking the Eastern Sea, yet wandering west.
Grievances and favors—why speak of them?
What is not tossed and churned cannot be made whole.
The world’s savor, once tasted, is sweeter than honey,
The nature of things, once seen through, is like drunken stupor.
Now, each attains a heart of no-use,
The moon hangs in the blue sky, water flows in the stream.

**Postscript to the Hall of True Principle’s Fusion**

When delusion and stillness are exhausted, purity is achieved,
The eye beholds the all-pervading Dharma-body.
Social dealings, unbound, flow through the cave of principle,
The living mechanism, subtly moving, is none other than my spirit.
A hundred rivers rush toward the Eastern Sea,
Myriad lights blaze, encircling the North Star.
I speak to the spring wind of old tidings,
Wildflowers and fragrant grasses renew all at once.

**As Before**

The drifting reeds and flowing waves have not left the source,
Who in this could discern the other?
From brow’s edge to eye’s corner—all is grasped,
By willow’s side, before the blossoms—everywhere encountered.
The walls and gates are shorn away, no barriers remain,
The locks and seals are broken, nothing is closed.
In the empty hall, sitting in stillness—man like jade,
The wind sways the bamboo’s tips, the moon hangs on the pine.

**Postscript to the *Sitting-in-Forgetfulness* Diagram**

The old man’s form is stiff as a rooted stump,
Sitting in stillness, yet restless, wandering paths.
In an instant, being and non-being merge with chaos,
Heaven and earth, above and below—a single lotus hut.
Forgetting both admiration and envy of the crane’s distant flight,
Unwilling to lightly soar like the phoenix of Yexian.
Clods of earth, heaps of dust—do not compare,
The vast sky, the great earth—are they not all mine?

**The Chamber of Sincerity**

Sincere intent, rectified heart—here this chamber dwells,
Esteemed teachers and good friends delight in each other’s company.
Before the courtyard, emerald bamboos stand in the wind,
Beneath the steps, red mallows turn toward the sun.
At dawn, the trees hear not the celestial music—all is still,
Through the night window, the moon’s radiance is shared.
Does the falling leaf of the paulownia portend it?
Already, autumn’s visage spreads across the nine realms.

**Leisure at Three Mountains**

Clumsy and inarticulate, I spare my superiors worry,
In my lazy nest, I still delight in pulling my sleeves over my head.
Thickly layered, the sitting mat spans three feet,
Easily prepared, the monastic gruel fills a single bowl.
Rising by day, sleeping by night—no affairs to attend,
Cold in summer, warm in winter—what more could I seek?
At times, the staff of blossoms stirs a wild impulse,
I roam the Three Mountains and the Ten Isles.

**The Work of Transformation**

Clods of earth contend in the empty sky of dreams,
The Work of Transformation shifts—utterly without feeling.
Before the eyes, fleeting profit is but a painted flower’s blush,
Above the head, hollow fame is but a broken drum’s sound.
A hundred years—long or short—mark life’s bounds,
A thousand changes—being and non-being—know no end.
In the end, what has been accomplished?
Only the body’s play with life and death.

**The Creator**

From of old, the Creator toys with poverty and success,
Manipulating floating life as if in a dream.
Fame and profit, being and non-being—shifting forms,
Right and wrong, self and other—vying for supremacy.
Habits accumulated over many lives—all false from the start,
Ten thousand affairs dissolve—utterly empty in the end.
Drunk and insensate—who is the master?
Falling blossoms and flying catkins chase the east wind.

**Following Dong Deqing’s Rhyme**

For ten years, I’ve not known the scholar’s curtain,
Tending to my true heart, at odds with the world.
I deeply laugh at Kui’s mutual pity,
Gazing at the ant’s struggle over trifles.
A sky of wind and moon—idle companions,
A thousand miles of clouds and mountains—old dependencies.
My traveling baggage is light, free of worldly things,
A broken gourd, a blossom staff—my only garments.

**Recalling Three Mountains While at the Changchun Palace in Yanjing**

Once in Liang Garden, I laughed and sang,
Gathering herbs with the grace of a lofty breeze.
The winding pools and crooked ponds—such scenes,
Slender bamboos, sparse plums—even more pure.
At the turtle’s back in the thatched hall, what thoughts arise?
My heart, at the turtle’s head in the mystic garden, is at ease.
Only the moon of Three Mountains remains night after night,
As before, golden blossoms dip into the blue waves.

*The Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Two, Concludes*
*The Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Three: Five-Character Regulated Verse*

**Five-Character Regulated Verse by Zhi Chang the Perfected, Ji Zhizhen**

**The Nature of the Dao**
Bright, bright—yet not a thing,
Clear, clear—nor mind within.
Vast, vast, it links heaven and earth,
Dark, dark, it threads past and present.
Being and nonbeing ever transform,
Birth and decay drift in false flux.
Neither gods nor ghosts can fathom,
Where to seek the voice-hearers’ trace?

**Endowment**
The body’s bones arise from earth,
The spirit’s light descends from heaven.
Six gates—yin ghosts lie subdued,
Through all ages, the Valley Spirit whole.
The moon of nature shines radiant,
The pearl of mind reflects all round.
When the ten thousand hues fade to naught,
Serene, one reaches the Double Mystery.

**Dispelling Delusion**
Turn the body free of the world’s net,
Exert force to sever the rope of confusion.
No peddler sells the Tower of What,
Who hangs the puppet stage?
Plant well the shadowless tree,
Light high the oil-less lamp.
The chamber fills with emptiness and white—
How dare illusions cling?

**Seeking the Real**
White jade emerges from stone,
Yellow gold is smelted from ore.
The inch of heart leaves love and desire,
The single nature shines round and bright.
It illumines kalpas beyond count,
Pierces the mustard-seed city’s walls.
From the wheel of rebirth one escapes—
No extinction, no birth remains.

**Yielding the Form**
Heaven’s mandate gathers the yielded substance,
Transforming things dance in yang’s vigor.
The restless sea of right and wrong,
The petty realm of fame and gain.
A hundred years—an instant’s span,
A thousand ages—a drifting dream.
Suddenly, one breaks through above—
The primal spirit returns to the Emperor’s land.

**Right and Wrong**
Right and wrong lack fixed decree,
No scale can weigh their measure.
The principles of things shift moment to moment,
Time’s light moves instant by instant.
Flies chase after specks to drive bones,
Snails quarrel on horns—walking corpses.
Daubing and smearing through the ages,
None discern the offered doubt.

**The Dusty World**
Ten thousand dusts sink in deep pits,
Two luminaries race like hurled pellets.
The world of snail-horn strife,
The officials of the locust-tree court.
Loyalty and sincerity grieve like uncut jade,
Cunning and flattery weep over pearl platters.
Endless illusions of delusion—
The floating life deceives its own eyes.

**The Great Body**
Heaven and earth merge in the great form,
Looking up and down—a lotus hut.
Ten thousand lights hang high as mirrors,
Grasses grow like counted chariots.
Being and nonbeing—divine transformations,
Waxing and waning—qi’s breath.
Not yet beyond the great furnace,
How can one roam the Great Void?

**Night Sitting**
Sitting dry, the dust of the heart dies,
Forgetting words, the Dao’s flavor lingers.
Not named the snail’s realm,
No dreams in the tortoise-shell frontier.
The kang warms—leaves burn often,
The stove glows—incense coils fresh.
Night deepens—limitless thoughts,
The bright moon fills the empty hall.

**Serene Simplicity**
Sitting firm on the rush mat’s strength,
The body warm in the sleeve’s coarse cloth.
Pinching incense to honor the rustic guest,
Boiling tea at the mountain boy’s call.
To send off—what laziness in the heart,
To clamor—ears seem deaf.
Dwelling in the mountains suits plainness,
How lovable this household’s way.

**Carefree Indolence**
Before guests, forget to lift the whisk,
Call the boy—weary of striking the bell.
The medicine stove’s embers remain,
Scriptures gather dust, sealed.
No thought to pen chickens and dogs,
No talk of befriending tigers and dragons.
In all things, no reliance—
Only this carefree indolence remains.

**Within the Abode**
Moss invades the new steps,
Pine shadows scatter the ancient altar.
Boiling tea with fallen leaves,
Stirring the fire with mountain sandalwood.
The wall’s moon pierces the thatched hut,
Fragrant winds stir the medicine rail.
So refreshing—this pure savor,
Kindred spirits, fear not the cold.

**The Master’s Chamber**
The master’s chamber holds the true realm,
The lotus hut reflects the jeweled terrace.
The door’s lintel hides the Three Realms,
The curtain rolls open the Nine Heavens.
Striking jade, cloud-cakes gather,
Ringing metal, the crane’s chariot hastens.
In the grotto, people do not age,
Green wine ever keeps them company.

**Worldly Affairs**
Worldly affairs are boundless,
Human life has its own measure.
Not understanding the pivot’s first use,
One is deluded by things’ emotions.
Offering laughter to guard the eyes,
Facing danger, one regrets too late.
Before it happens, first grasp it—
Lift up to climb heaven’s ladder.

**Cloud Wandering**
Loosen the moorings of the empty boat,
Unlock the iron lock’s clasp.
The body’s needs—leisurely days,
A hundred patches—old livelihood.
Kicking and leaping, one asks the world,
Drifting, drifting—home beyond form.
Gather well the rainbow staff,
Hook and bait—drink cloud and mist.

**Recalling the Mountains**
Carefree and proud in forests and springs,
Who speaks of Buddha or immortal?
Sweep away the reins and fetters,
Sever the kudzu vines’ entanglements.
Not fawning in the human world,
Forgetting the heaven beyond things.
Wild clouds, the creek’s moon—
Unbounded, the soaring spirit.

**Ease**
Wherever one is, seek the body’s ease,
Nothing like inquiring within the square inch.
Poverty and success—times’ ties,
Life and death—the fate’s bond.
The wondrous body beyond yin and yang,
The form left behind in heaven and earth.
Mysteriously linked to the Maker,
Silently turning the wheel of right and wrong.

**Paper Quilt**
Not obtained from the Wang household,
First bestowed by the Cai family.
The work is easily done,
The warmth—no wonder.
Hanging on the wall, clouds return to the peaks,
Covering the head, snow rests on the mountains.
Not seeking the world’s esteem,
It befits this body’s leisure.

**Twelve Poems Sent from the Eastern Cottage at Purple Tenuity**

**Spring**
Delighted to build and plant,
Work follows creation’s unfolding.
Vegetable plots beside the well,
Herb gardens near the wall’s embrace.
Peaches and plums bloom in order,
Lush and clinging, the wild grasses.
Unaware of worldly affairs,
Daily life—truly carefree.

**Summer**
Flower hedges encroach on the wild meadows,
Lush greens meet the empty hall.
Tall trees—thousands of trunks unite,
Cool shade—frost on all sides.
Plums heap ripe on the branches,
Fragrance spills through the garden.
No need to weigh coins—
The farm folk offer them to taste.

**Autumn**
Farmers gather the hundred grains,
Crisp air comes from the western suburbs.
Sweeping again the leaves before the steps,
Adding more thatch to the roof.
Frost descends on the red brocade trees,
Cold hastens the saffron buds.
No sign of people or oxen,
Only the herding boy’s whistle heard.

**Winter**
Double doors, curtains unrolled,
The kang warm, paper windows bright.
No inquiry of the garden’s phase,
Forgetting the snow-wrapped blossoms.
Burning incense, mist’s hues congeal,
Boiling tea, the wind’s sound rises.
Sitting in repose on the rush mat,
What does the human world make of it?

**Day**
The thatched hut—still and desolate,
The kitchen boy needs no knife.
The mountain boy forbids cunning cuts,
The rustic guest calls for a roam.
Paths narrow—trampled by people,
Plots overgrown—planted with a staff’s play.
Utterly free of the world’s burdens,
True joy—naturally content.

**Night**
The watch late, the door unlatched,
Wrapped in coarse cloth, the Valley Spirit congeals.
At the forest’s edge hangs the golden mirror,
From the eaves’ teeth—the jade rope’s bones.
In the stove, embers live on,
Beneath the window, the clear lamp continues.
The night deepens—what boundless thoughts,
The bright moon fills the empty hall.

**Long Sitting**
Long sitting—body like a mountain at rest,
Clothed, pillowing the crooked arm.

**Dawn**
At first light, strike the golden bell,
The empty hall shakes with ancestral wind.
As circumstance allows, all is wondrous use,
Or let it exhaust the spirit’s power.
The precious tripod—clouds coil and knot,
The thatched eaves—qi thick and lush.
Those who toil for gain,
How could they share this hour?

**Dusk**
Dust upon dust—all shattered,
The humble hut ever the same.
Wrapped in coarse cloth, the original match,
The rush mat—long needed.
Sealed like a hidden treasure,
Guarded like a luminous pearl.
Entering the realm of nothingness,
Now I forget my former self.

**Walking**
Leaning on a staff, walking with trust,
Forgetting schemes, even dogs do not startle.
The sparse fence—crickets chirp,
The tall tree—crows murmur.
Things follow yin and yang’s changes,
People follow creation’s workings.
The wilds hold boundless stores,
Orchids and irises—lovely life.

**Dwelling**
Steady and still, dwelling with the times,
No green surpasses the green of absence.
Little burdened by worldly clutter,
Unbound by profit or fame.
Yesterday like today,
Next year like the last.
The sheep’s intent—utterly cast aside,
Why do ants crave rank flesh?

**Sitting**
Wrapped in coarse cloth, sitting on the rush mat,
Yellow dust does not reach the door.
Dimming perception—not mere silence,
Forgetting the self—my true self remains.
What need to record ancestral intent?
The mysterious void—best left unspoken.
This is the root of natural being,
Peacefully passing dawn and dusk.

**Nanhua**
Mastering the *Nanhua*’s essence,
Its mechanisms are no longer hard to grasp.
Release it—boundless,
Gather it—a sphere of joy.
In use, it mingles with dust and light,
Returning to the source—the rivers and seas run dry.
The bronze steed stands in the street,
Nowhere to ask for Chang’an.

**Pure Scenes**
The patterned staff parts the creek’s clouds,
Straw sandals tread the mountain’s snow.
Gathering life-giving mushrooms,
Occasionally dining on life-extending crumbs.
The pine’s tip—the moon just round,
Beyond the bamboo—the wind utterly clear.
This scene is not easily known,
Do not speak of it for fame or gain.

**No Distinction**
All things—make no distinction,
Where you arrive, cease boasting.
Tightly guard life and fate,
Diligently refine private deceit.
In darkness, forget illusory things,
The true bone—yang spirit appears.
Coming and going—freely,
Unburdened by life and death’s changes.

**Qian Dongdeqing’s Rhyme**
Life’s worth lies in contentment,
A tranquil heart—body at ease.
The grass hut’s new sitting mat,
The alms bowl’s old cotton cloth.
Wind sweeps the courtyard—still,
Moon approaches the window—cold.
The stringless lute hangs on the wall,
Its pure tone needs no strumming.

**Following the Immortal’s "Heavenly Sound" Rhyme**

**I**
The pure spirit-wind stirs,
Where does it not resound?
Yu and Yu open all apertures,
Its touch stirs the depths of life.
The lingering echo returns to perfect stillness,
The turning mechanism suddenly shifts.
Seeking the true intent,
How could words contain it?

**II**
Leaning on the armrest—not just now or then,
The spirit-wind issues from the great void.
All forms dance,
What thing does it not blow through?
Its wondrous body lies beyond yin and yang,
Its sound transmits creation’s beginning.
Blowing the holeless flute alone,
Its clear tone pierces Huaxu.

**Ode to Knowing the Constant and Transmitting the Spirit**
This strange form,
Ever like withered ash lying in wait.
Capturing the true—truly impossible,
Clinging to the false—what use is the false?
The painter of cinnabar—weary and worn,
Ever dwells in emptiness and brightness.
A hundred years—turning to look back,
A straw rope ties the spring wind.

**Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Three – Long and Short Lines**
*Long and Short Lines*
*By Knowing the Constant Immortal, Ji Zhizhen*

**To Move and Rest**

To walk when one wills to walk, to sit when one wills to sit.
Sing when merry, sleep when weary.
The wordless speaker—thus roams free.
High towers and cloud-strung zithers need not play,
spared the search for pines and wind in harmony.

**Vital Force and Life**
Moving like water, still as mountains.
Sitting, the gates open; silent, the wheel turns.
The pivot blends being and non-being as one,
sound and form fade beyond face and crown.

**Nature and Destiny**
Nature is simple, destiny arduous.
Yin and yang unfathomable,
what care for gods or ghosts?
All things follow transformation,
no thread left idle.
Who masters the gentle east wind?
Spring’s hues steal unseen to mortal inquiry.

**Perfection and Authenticity**
The True and Perfect—whole, never lacking,
true and original, never false.
Whole and true in essence,
one mold, two aspects.
Open the mouth—names and words fall,
raise the brow—shadows form.
The master flicks his sleeve and returns,
how then to sing the homecoming tune?

**The Profound and Wondrous**
When all ties are severed, what more to say?
The mechanism beyond lies beyond speech.
Seek profound principles elsewhere,
and all are snared in vines.

**True Emptiness**
One aperture—empty void,
eight sides—clear and bright.
Unfurl the treasure trove,
unfold the numinous traces.
Were it not for the force that sweeps away wisps of cloud,
how could cold radiance illumine the great void?

**Serene Harmony**
The celestial nature briefly restored,
harmonious qi flows unbound.
Neither yin nor yang,
neither joy nor sorrow.
Pursue it further—words fail,
tall willows nod in the wind’s smile.

**Spirit and Vitality**
Ancient and wondrous,
spirit gallops with divine power.

Free and unbounded, transformations endless.
Through metal and stone they pass, play with the void.
A light touch—heaven and earth shatter to fragments,
one roar—skulls deaf for three days.

Might like a tiger, force like a dragon,
lest you crash into the tangle of vines.

**Non-Action**
Add a hair’s breadth—too much,
remove a hair’s breadth—too little.
Purity and stillness, true and inherent,
majesty without contrivance.

The Dharma-body fills the great void,
yet stands within a speck of dust to reveal subtlety.

**Recognizing Mind**
Who is this "recognizer"?
What is this "mind"?
Grasp it—more than enough,
abandon it—never enough.

A head atop a head,
a jellyfish with shrimp for eyes.

Returning to the old master of the three paths,
prune the flowering weeds to plant pines and chrysanthemums.

**Seeing Nature**
In the ear—it hears,
in the mouth—it speaks.
Lift a hand, move a foot,
blink an eye, raise a brow.

Those within know—do they not?
Freely commanded, what doubt remains?

If you take what is seen as real,
you fall into the second mechanism of side doors.

**Hun and Po**
Nature is the master, form the dwelling;
roaming—it is *hun*, resting—it is *po*.
If you distinguish to discuss the mystery,
a hair’s breadth of error—heaven and earth apart.

**Awareness and Illumination**
Who illuminates?
Who is aware?
A goose’s life passes in a single breath,
blurred in twofold error.

Break through this barrier,
both sides—empty and desolate.

The west wind rustles through the evening grove,
a flurry of red leaves falls in whispering descent.

**Hiding the World Within the World**
Where the Way is absent,
hasten back in turn.

Where the Dao resides, do not cling.
Empty space entrusted to empty space—
the heavenly eye, the dragon’s gaze, unseen.

**Substance and Function**
Water is wave, wave is water.
Where there is substance, there is function;
where there is function, there is substance.
Neither identical nor separate,
neither one nor two.
In concealment, the body enters the finest hair;
in manifestation, its light illumines heaven and earth.
Though all return to the wondrous source,
many paths diverge—
silently revolving through the four seasons,
a single year is made.

**No Person, No Self**
Substance—no person;
function—no self.
Neither identical nor separate,
now leading, now harmonizing.
Neither dharma nor non-dharma,
no can and no cannot.
Past, present, and future—all perfectly merged;
stand upon a single mote and see the living fall.

**Solitary Peak**
The solitary peak of the past—blind and deaf.
The solitary peak to come—impenetrable.
The solitary peak of the present—
from west, from east.
All under heaven is none other—
where else to seek union?
Beside the thousand-zhang limpid pool,
the rootless is reflected upside-down—
above and below, empty.

**Life and Death**
One thought arises, one thought perishes.
Shedding the body, assuming the body—
when will it end?
Changing heads and faces without knowing,
living in vain, dying in vain—endless.
If the heart is empty, thoughts cease;
cut away the root, and branches and leaves wither.
Alone, the true person stands revealed—
in a single instant, transcending ten thousand kalpas.

**Host and Guest**
Who is without a master?
Call, and it opens its eyes to look.
Six gates radiate light,
four doors ever guarded.
Host is guest, guest is host—
master of the house, do not grow weary.
Beneath the Moonlight Pavilion it walks,
within the Hall of Withered Trees it dwells.
One morning, the foul skin cast off—
through the three realms and ten directions,
it walks alone.

**Eighteen Matters in Reply to Master Kang’s Questions**

**The Guest’s Fan**
Within the breast, a coiled waxen coil;
beneath the wrist, dragons and serpents course.
Attain it—all under heaven flows;
lose it—one body guards alone.
Silent, silent—
seal the mouth, seal the mouth.
Better to take the soaring roc’s heart of ten thousand miles
and trade it for the hand that angles for leviathans on the three isles.

*Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Three: Seven-Character Quatrains*
Composed by Perceiver of the Constant, Ji Zhi Zhen

**Seven-Character Quatrains: Three Exhortations to Advance**

The Great Dao has no form, empty as void—
who would fix the heart here to cultivate?
Clouds disperse, the moon ascends the azure vault:
where is there no gleam of radiant light?

*Same Theme*
Spirit hollow as a shrine, still and without care,
yet it stirs and stirs, trafficking in bones.
Sever the swift current of life-and-death’s waves—
bid the ashes cool, emulate the fasting heart.

*Same Theme*
A single leaf reveals the workings of creation’s wheel,
each hair’s tip and blade’s edge fitting with art.
Say not all the Yang’s warmth has been spent—
the binding winds come and go, yet you know not.

**Deluded Household**
East and west you daub, chasing fleeting splendor—
when will you turn homeward to your native hut?
The master once gladly sojourned as guest—
mount the carriage early, tarry not.

**Forgetting the Root**
Footprints cast aside, the great delusion overturned,
yet you force divisions, spawning endless doubt.
The source flows vast, transmitted through the ages—
sunk in red dust, you know it not.

**Night’s End**
The azure vault stretches empty, bearing the jade cord;
behold the lone moon hanging from the eaves.
Floating life follows the wormwood’s root to frost—
disturbed, the dream of *Huaxu* will not form.

**Fragrant Spring**
Peach and plum melt in sequence, fragrant in turn,
butterflies and bees in swarms chase the lingering scent.
They know not the play of true *samādhi*—
frantic, they rage in the east and west wind.

**Everlasting Spring**
Petals of peach brook scatter dawn’s rosy clouds,
before the news reaches the mountain hut.
In the Cave of Everlasting Spring, the rootless tree—
unbound by east winds, it blooms of itself.

**Seeing Illusion**
A thousand forms, ten thousand shapes, each distinct,
yet the ailing eye sees but a cartload of ghosts.
Sweep away the dead ashes—cold flame remains;
let the sky-toppling waves rage as they will.

**Border Corruption**
Border ills long laid out, tangled as hemp,
bewitching travelers, dazzling the ailing eye.
Sever the kudzu vines, go without care—
a single pavilion of wind and moon, your old livelihood.

**Praise and Blame**
Piercing skin to pluck feathers—idle trouble,
washing grime to seek scars—misguided zeal.
See through the master, rest and depart—
distant mountains, autumn waters, naturally profound.

**Knowing Delusion**
The mystery’s gate above is not easily known;
even the Seven Sages of Xiangcheng doubted.
Why seek daily renewal from a boy?
Returning from obeisance—who then is it?

**Self-Attainment**
Breaking through the gate of *xiyi* above,
the primal spirit sits in empty leisure.
In leisure, self-attained, true play—
the sky’s pass is nowhere, yet everywhere at peace.

**One Qi**
Flowing freely, one *qi* is thusness itself,
no mutual reliance, merged with the Great Void.
Turn the mystery’s gate, grasp true rest—
the four births all enter the without-remainder.

**Heart-Field**
Cut away brambles, plant orchids and irises,
firm-rooted, tend the numinous sprout with care.
When merit is full, the white ox sleeps in dew—
moon bright, wind gentle, the master at ease.

**Heart-Flower**
Great transformation cannot bind or restrain it,
linked fragrance is only allowed to bloom freely.
One branch, transmitted anew through the ages—
its rich scent wafts through the nine heavens.

**Heart-Tally**
Demons and goblins swept away, no trace remains,
unfettered galloping, great spiritual power.
Grasping the essential, shaking the cardinal—
ten thousand sages and immortals stand in awe.

**Heart-Moon**
Sweep away all dust, ten thousand sounds still—
the cold hue, serene, imprints heaven’s heart.
Lift the head—every household is there;
countless empty births seek it on the fingertip.

**Heart-Incense**
Not sandalwood’s dense fragrance, nor aloes’ grace,
but the warm stove’s living fire, glowing soft.
A single petal from before the kalpas, lit anew—
how could gourds hanging hinder its passage?

**Heart-Zither**
Ten thousand sounds stilled, night not yet spent,
stringless, it plays a melody clear and bright.
Ziqi does not understand, nor the crowd hear—
groping the bronze tray, they make a sun.

**Heart-Sword**
Snow-bright blade gleams, its might leaning on heaven,
raised, there is nothing above, nothing before.
Not merely its vapor piercing the Dipper and Ox—
it slices the void, revealing the Emperor’s origin.

**Heart-Mirror**
Gathering the water-chestnut mirror, years uncounted,
the solitary moon descends the jade sky, dazzling.
Hung in the empty hall, it startles gods and ghosts—
lucid and still, its light fills the great thousand.

**Heart-Pearl**
Sealed in the wish-fulfilling treasury, boundless store,
night’s glow shines upon the Five Luminous Palaces.
Meeting a knowing friend, it is drawn forth—
ten thousand rosy beams pierce the azure void.

**Heart-Lamp**
Vast and boundless, the mystery makes a humble stand,
neither tallow nor torch, yet it radiates light.
Heaven and earth permit no thread’s separation—
how dare mountain ghosts and demonic spirits pass?

**Valuing Silence**
All cling to "I," racing in competition,
yet in the end, there is no right or wrong.
In the crowd, remain utterly silent—
naturally, both sides forget their schemes.

**Floating Life**
Floating life—an instant’s snap of the fingers,
tumultuous, clamorous, self-blocked.
All is hidden in this mass of filth—
vainly it saddens the master to death.

**Self-Regret**
Chasing snail-horn, fly-head gains,
lost in the crowd, vainly blowing the *yu*.
Now, old and great, I know regret—
all those cloud-like deeds were but fledglings.

**Postscript to Yuan Xian’s Rebuke of Bestowed Maps**
The Dao reaches forgetting words, yet is most intimate;
this poverty is no illness—no need for alms.
Auspiciousness truly abides in empty whiteness—
how could I speak the true wind to you?

**Without Feeling**
Without feeling is not pride in the moment,
but gathering spirit lest it stray outward.
Today, release it—only then is it potent;
all life’s affairs are known in old age.

**Primal Beginning**
Wisdom and clarity arise before speech—
this is the primal beginning’s ineffable wonder.
Yet within it, forms divide—
below, like the hidden earth; above, like heaven.

**Ease**
In the thicket of right and wrong, no words,
in the arena of profit and fame, no passage.
Worldly sentiments and human affairs—none of my concern—
at ease, I pass this life.

**Following One’s Lot**
No envy for jade spread before the feast,
coarse or fine, once sated, all the same.
Morning three, evening four—follow my lot,
winning body and heart’s leisure everywhere.

**Level Mind**
Tangled hair, tattered clothes—people are shocked,
yet brocade robes and golden crowns bring no peace.
One hue, a level mind, no different appearance—
no seeking others’ esteem, no flaunting conduct.

**One’s Lot**
No wildness, no indulgence of the heart,
seek the Dao in a level mind, one’s lot.
The vast sky has every household’s moon—
ask not of floating or sinking, shallow or deep.

**Self-Observation**
Through kalpas of rebirth, the heart grows weary—
now gathered into a single sphere of joy.
Light shines forth, vast and boundless—
not in others’ gaze, but in self-observation.

**Without Heart**

**Joy Illusory**
Joy that stands apart is not true joy—
joy at its peak brings sorrow, for it bears a heart.
Better far to be without heart, sorrow and joy spent,
a single radiant Way, ancient yet ever now.

**Sloth**
Sloth, idleness, stolen ease—this is not leisure,
fore-thought, after-thought, both entwined.
Cut all ties, sever even the faintest thought,
unmoved, steadfast as Mount Tai.

**Immortal and Mortal**
Gain and loss cycle endlessly, no use to contend,
walk the Way with a level mind, one’s lot.
Immortal or mortal—ask not of either,
recall only the primal state, how it first was.

**Mystic Gate**
Forty years within the Mystic Gate,
a gnat’s flight shatters the jar’s sky.
Boundless, free, vast as can be—
antler’s tip, fly’s head, not worth a coin.

**Things Borrowed**
All things rise and sink like foam on water,
the Craftsman’s work unceasing—what tower does He build?
Foolish child, idly toying,
clay dogs, mud carts, shattered and done.

**Fleeing Transformation**
Grasp the mountain’s boat shifting imperceptibly,
with heart, even heaven and earth may be escaped.
Yet within the world lies a hidden refuge—
return by the very path, doubt no more.

**Silent Accord**
Worldly passions cling—let not a speck of heart remain,
cold tears unchecked, lips too weary to part.
Knowing exists, yet none may comprehend,
the bridal chamber sealed deep in white clouds.

**Dust-Brushing**
Cultivation, in essence, is heart-cultivation,
scraping away dust and vines, ten thousand cares sink.
Revealed, the primal, luminous thing—
no need for knowing, no need for seeking.

**Emptiness**
Cultivate the heart-ground to be empty,
shatter every dust-mote, every instant.
Then appears the primal true face—
neither loss nor gain, neither excess nor lack.

**Form and Count**
Short or long, roughly a hundred years,
fretful, toiling life—empty in the end.
Look above for the true matter,
the secret transmission of the flame, endless in use.

**Lost Heart**
The heart, bright yet adrift, cast upon dust and sand,
like sweeping fallen blossoms at the brushwood gate.
No hand can gather it back—
borne by wind and water, it never returns home.

**Taming the Heart**
Ten thousand threads of circumstance disturb the heart’s spirit,
red dust thickens, veiling the mirror’s face.
A master’s hand applies its skill, polishing it clean—
cold light shines through, illuminating all.

**Longevity**
Longevity—what of the illusory body?
Count spent, return to the source, buried in earth.
Only the original true nature—who grasps it?
From ancient times to now, no going, no coming.

**Arising and Ceasing**
The wheel of arising and ceasing stems from the heart,
thought upon thought flowing, from ancient times to now.
Ground to ash, it stirs not in flight—
suddenly, a solitary moon rises over the jade peak.

**Seeking Within**
The celestial true nature lies within—seek not without,
phantasmal dust, clod of earth—let all such matters rest.
A vast, idle expanse of clear, frozen ground—
white jade, yellow gold, not worth its price.

**Leisurely Dwelling**
In the land of Great Peace, a man of Great Peace,
beneath the Two Forests, in the mountain’s embrace, this body lodged.
Cloud friends meet—nothing to say,
a hundred flowers sing, birds call—one spring.

**Revisiting the Old**
Sitting, gazing heavenward, sighing,
singing the *Yang Pass*—will there be a reunion?
Shadow-grass, probing pole—both laid down,
all trace the gourd’s outline as before.

**Dusty Realm**
White waves surge—sea of right and wrong,
yellow dust rolls—market of fame and profit.
Helpless, the warring snail and ant clans,
unaware of their fleeting, insubstantial lives.

**Form’s Faintness**
A snail’s two horns—an age-old tale,
a spark from stone—a hundred-year body.
Who has eyes vast as cartwheels,
seeing through the boundless, rolling dust?

**Obstruction’s Speech**
Plucking twigs, gathering leaves—still tossed by waves,
the vast, untainted source remains untouched.
Hang the question on the wall, sit idly,
all drunk, stumbling toward Chang’an.

**Breaking the Net**
The world’s net loosely woven, yet the Dharma’s net confines,
examining oneself, bound and shackled—self-entwined.
One tug at the prison’s bolt—all falls away,
staff and sandals in the western wind, a nodding smile.

**Sitting Alone**
A hundred patches, cloud-draped, staff and sandals idle,
a thatched hut, briefly Mount Zaotan’s incense.
Guests come seeking the Way—no words to say,
laughing, pointing to empty space, "Look closely."

**Guarding Folly**
Not learning the cold cat’s mouse-stalking folly,
window bright, hearth warm, sleeves layered.
Guests sit face to face, as if deceived,
asked of the world’s affairs—all unknown.

**Sitting Long**
Clouds mirror green mountains, pleasing the rustic heart,
grass mats, flat stones, old pine’s shade.
Sitting deeper into nothingness,
heedless of the vast sky, the sun’s descent.

**Guarding Clumsiness**
Forgotten the furnace’s alchemy of lead and mercury,
outside the gate, let the kudzu vines grow long.
Nothing worth doing—days passed in idleness,
all laugh at my hundredfold incompetence.

**Thatched Hut**
Overgrown paths, three measures—no visitors,
windows and doors creak, autumn’s clarity.
Yet the true flavor of congeniality is found—
not a speck of worldly dust reaches the heart.

**Startling the World**
Plunging deep into the market of profit and fame,
bound and wearied, the heart grows ever more wounded.
Discarding weight for lightness—perverse use,
where one should build a dike, none is built.

**Vain Life**
Toiling, restless, body and heart not free,
a hundred years, wind-driven foam on water.
Vain life, reckless death—no limit,
see through it, return, and be done.

**Peaceful Life**
Frowning, debating old and new,
in a blink—who knows the shift from ancient to now?
Present, future—both unrecognized,
ask who permits the question of peaceful heart?

**Attached to Things**
Fleeting fame, fleeting profit—how deep the intent?
Schemes exhausted, the heart broken in use.
All for descendants’ thousand-year plans,
heedless of bones crumbling into earth.

**Pursuing Circumstances**
Before one’s eyes, yellow dust churns,
great transformation shifts, moment by moment new.
In the pit of birth and death, none awaken,
abandoning the self only to cling to profit and fame.

**Fame and Profit**
Servants, horses, carriages, boats—perils endured,
petty fame and profit, both entwined.
Pondering, one sought only peace and stability,
yet body and heart know no moment’s rest.

**Guests Arrive**
Hearing the carriage’s knock at the brushwood gate,
patched robe hastily donned, a forced welcome.
Knowing no money for village wine,
a bowl of spring snow—frugal fellowship.

**Passing Quietly**
The bridal chamber unlocked, never barred,
the azure vault vast, the moon fills the courtyard.
For ages, cloud and lute—strings never strung,
night’s chill, flowing water—cold, clear tones.

**Shedding Dust**
Shedding dust, shedding Dharma, shedding all threads,
no talk of elixir perfected, ascending the ninth heaven.
Delusion gone, truth does not stand—
no words reach the profound mystery.

**Unknowing**
A thousand differences, ten thousand divergences—none can be made equal,
leaping beyond constraint into unknowing.

**Within It, Distinctions Transform**
Yet within it, all shifting forms—
piled mountains, heaped peaks—all are non-action.

**Subtlety**
The drifting reeds, the flowing waves—never leave the source,
Wu Xian’s lost thoughts achieve no merit.
Long before high antiquity, before heaven and earth,
the great Daoist wind resounds, everywhere the same.

**Restored Wholeness**
The flame of longevity passed down, years uncounted,
long steeped in human falsity, stained by all threads.
All conditions pared away, human artifice forgotten—
the primordial celestial truth stands whole as ever.

**Dwelling in the Mountains**
From old bound to cloud and mountain,
mist and sunset claimed, no coin touched.
By the stream, on the rocks—idle play,
no inquiry of the human world, no study of immortality.

**Nanhua’s Nine Heavens**

**I**
Heaven’s harmony—no joy, no sorrow,
the stone maiden knows, smiling, nodding.
Sated with wine, at ease in daily use,
beyond the natural—what more is sought?

**II**
Heaven’s music—form and sound unpatterned,
ten thousand beings grow, each self-arising.
One wind gathers all into perfect stillness—
things exhausted, people empty—is there even seeing?

**III**
Heaven’s gate opens and shuts—none can know,
sitting upright, not a single thought.
From this, the ten thousand things, the ten thousand dusts emerge,
falling blossoms, drifting catkins—naturally scattered.

**IV**
Heaven’s light, the cosmos’ peace—self-evident,
piercing idle illusions, shattering iron walls.
Everywhere unobstructed, no blockage,
mountains and rivers, the great earth—level, serene.

**V**
Heaven’s mechanism—hints of presence and absence,
revolving the cosmos, the myriad forms at leisure.
Stirring the primal hinge of the *guanli* child,
in an instant, spring’s hue fills the world.

**VI**
Heaven’s wandering—gaze as high as mugwort, none can fathom,
discarding the old, chasing the new—moment by moment shifting.
Clenched fist opens, outstretched palm passes—
the living impulse, without fail, falls into the present.

**VII**
Heaven’s treasury—no containment, yet nothing excluded,
a single hair encompasses the vast void.
Breaking open the seal, I show you—
laughing, even the ancestral brows of old would visit.

**VIII**
Heaven’s boundary—innately endowed with numinous power,
one body, vast or fine, functions differently.
Try asking the bound wind—no answer,
willow tips pale green, young peach blossoms red.

**IX**
Heaven’s potter’s wheel—no self, no other,
the ten thousand things rise and sink, each moment new.
When the last days of winter yield to warming rhythms,
wildflowers and fragrant grasses—one and all, spring.

*Cloud and Mountain Collection, Scroll Four: Seven-Character Quatrains*
By Perceiver of the Constant Dao, Ji Zhi Zhen

**Reeds**

Soughing reeds—how many autumns have passed,
yet pitiful, the old man still does not return to rest.
Fine-scaled fish refuse the cloud-and-mist bait,
vainly striking at moonlit hooks in the bright waves.

**True Joy**

No joy, no knowing—yet living mechanism stirs.
No harm if others mock such utter folly.
Who knows that the joyless, knowingless one—
a single wisp of idle sorrow dares crease the brow.

**Friend Mountain**

A blossom-staff befits the visit to a true-hearted friend,
a thatched hut must neighbor a mountain of delight.
A beneficial friend, a fine mountain—face to face,
no matter if all day long we laugh and chat at ease.

**Nurturing Nature**

Seizing the dark pearl from the formless shadow,
justly let tranquility and wisdom nurture each other.
With years, release the great radiance,
illuminating the boundless treasury of heaven and earth.

**Moonlit Night**

Windows open, wind pure, moon filling the breast,
lightly I step to Penglai’s isle.
The world’s people cannot break their sorrow’s fortress—
misfortune reaches even the scholars in the gourd.

**Unfettered**

The cinnabar tide of heaven’s boundary—unrestrained,
roaming the seas at will, driving freely.
The Great Peace bears no image, few encounter it,
the Red Waters vainly drown the shadowless pearl.

**Jade Hairpin**

From the Jasper Terrace, Flying Jade dances in emerald mist,
a lost hairpin falls to earth, growing into a flower.
Linked fragrance, unbroken, passes through blue and white,
bestowed upon the Daoist of cloud and mountain.

**A Poem Comes**

Myriad dusts shed, qi and spirit at peace,
silently turning in the empty sky, the living eye revolves.
Unexpected, a poem comes to stir—
the five-cloud return path has nothing to do with it.

**Four Poems on Mount Pan**

**Spring**

Mountain hues closely transmit the true workings of creation,
water sounds unfold the karmic conditions of the Dao.

**The Good Heart**

The good heart’s use is boundless in all directions—
why must one rave like a madman at the butcher’s block?

**Summer**

Beneath the pavilion, the breeze clears, robes grow chill,
before the mountain, travelers’ brows drip with sweat.
Immortal and mortal are not far—yet cloud and mud divide them,
fame and profit drive men, never granting them rest.

**Autumn**

The heat’s departure in the mountains goes wholly unnoticed,
yet suddenly the yellow chrysanthemums vie in fragrance.
A single day’s stern decree from the west wind—
scattered across half the sky, red leaves take flight.

**Winter**

Frost and snow ravage the brocade’s emptiness,
the mountains’ old forms remain all around.
Deep in the night, seated in the meditation chamber, incense burning,
a single sound—wind roaring through ten thousand valleys of pines.

**Sitting in Stagnation**

Within the phrase, searching for the mechanism of transcendence,
the lost child of the family forgets even to return.
Unknowing, he breaks through the papered window—
releasing the foolish fly to fly freely at last.

**Near the Body**

The sea boy plays in the water, the gulls sense him first,
the dull-witted fool holds his pole, the cicada knows nothing.
Profound and subtle, hiding the self with no place to abide,
meeting Ji Xian, one appears just as foolish.

**On Movement and Stillness: Two Poems for Xu Shaoming**

**I**

Move and you follow others; still, you grow dull—
between the two, forgotten, lies the living pivot.
Only when the tongueless speak can one converse,
then trust that names and words are truly right and wrong.

**II**

On the central plain, wolves and tigers rage, drooling,
yet a peach-blown refuge hides a cavern heaven.
Flowing water, falling blossoms—still they remain,
I bid you board the headless boat.

**As Before**

At the immortal’s high assembly, speaking of Fanghu,
laughing, they point to Penglai—its waters nearly dry.
No need to sing of herding oxen and eating white stones,
better to seek the formless and demand the dark pearl.

**Returning from the Fishing**

In withered reeds and dead waters, no fish to catch,
light bait on a bamboo rod—idle all day.
Not like Master Ren of Kuaiji,
who in a small boat, with the moon, nightly explored and returned.

**As Before**

The weak, mourning their lost homeland, know nothing,
on the path of the forgetful sheep, they grow ever more lost.
Best to gather early the clouds-and-mist bait,
one oar through the wind and moonlight on the stream.

**The Moon of Nature**

Vast, the numinous wind sweeps all clean,
the sky of nature brandishes—no wisp of cloud remains.
Heaven and earth, one hue, like a silver realm,
releasing the radiant, never-dark pearl.

**Warning the World**

Swift as a shuttle, time is cast away,
in an instant, old age—twin temples grizzled.
When the unseen summons comes to call,
hands and feet in panic—what can you do?

**The Heart’s Mechanism**

The heart’s mechanism exhausted for the family’s sake,
white hair hangs heavy, eyes grow dim.
In the end, not knowing where it will alight,
on the verge of departure, still instructing sons and grandsons.

**A Hundred Years**

A hundred years of time—just a moment,
greedily scheming all day with cunning.
Every needle, every blade of grass—predestined,
yet one forces body and mind to never rest.

**Old Yan**

Old Yan is merciless—who does not know?
Before one’s eyes, the scene—still one grasps and covets.
Beware the day it comes upon your head,
no excuse to offer—how grave the affliction!

**Forest and Spring**

Grasses and trees, thickets and groves—all are mystery,
the cold jade’s pure sound rinses the flowing spring.
Sitting in forgetfulness, who understands the lingering light?
Dew drips from the pine tips—the moon is full.

**The Idle One**

Wind through the woods, moonlight veiling mountain blossoms,
strange rocks, stream—all one family.
Only the idle one is fit to preside,
without feeling, without self—companion to mist and clouds.

**Cultivating the True**

To cultivate the true—what is there to cultivate?
With a shout, sever all ties—ten thousand affairs cease.
Perfecting the inherent, original virtue-power,
step by step, follow the bright moon to Yingzhou.

**Immortals**

Seek not immortals beyond yourself—
they are but the original, single heart.
Unfettered, beyond the dust’s grasp,
they teach the great earth to turn to gold.

**Prolonging Life**

There is a way to prolong life, never to die—
best to empty the cinnabar crucible and ask the Medicine King.
When the mundane heart is wholly carved away, cast into the divine elixir,
like the cicada’s molt—clearly shedding the bitter husk.

**Reciting Scriptures**

Spreading nets, setting snares—accumulating karma,
in old age, thoughtlessly chanting *maha*.
Clinging to delusion, vainly seeking future blessings—
how will Old Yan ever let you pass?

**The Butterfly Dream**

As Zhou, as butterfly—two forms divide,
yet who has seen the dreamer?
Grasping the message of fluttering lotus,
the vast sky, great earth—all is my body.

**Kui and the Mosquito**

The celestial truth’s use—all-pervading spirit,
piercing the formless and the formed alike.
Wondrous function, driving and guiding—everywhere present,
moon bright on the river, wine just sobered.

**The Liang Bridge**

From the outset, no joy, no knowledge,
joy and knowledge arise—second mechanism.
Tracing back to the source, seeking where knowing begins,
fish and self—naturally return as one.

**The Ox’s Disassembly**

Worldly affairs pile like mountains, heap like peaks,
dismantling them is like no dismantling—the blade’s edge vast.
Unwilling to sharply judge the tangled,
guard the spirit’s edge closely—do not idly unsheathe.

**Herding Horses**

Sacred wisdom, slippery and cunning, deludes the great array,
the wild boy, sickly and blind, yet teaches heaven.
The finest dust harms the nature—it must be pared away,
revealing the original, wondrous and untransmitted.

**Raising Chickens**

Once the original is fully awakened, rest the heart,
precisely because there is no heart—deeper the merit.
Seated, like wood carved or clay molded,
what in the world dares encroach?

**Catching the Cicada**

The old man still has not forgotten his art,
the cicada’s wing hides the body—the cicada knows nothing.
When you reach the realm of ghosts and spirits, beyond reckoning,
plucking it up, effortlessly—what doubt remains?

**Taming the Gulls**

One’s own spirit is the spirit of things,
if one is without heart, things naturally grow still.
The empty realm, by chance, opens a single thread—
the sea gulls dare not alight on the sandy shore.

**Raising Tigers**

The human heart is fiercer than the mountain tiger,
daring to unleash, in an instant, joy and rage.
Placed in the original, pure, and still realm,
forgetting both self and other—naturally at peace.

**Restraining the Monkey**

Exhausting the spirit for one thing—knowing no sameness,
all with perception are trapped in creation’s cage.
Fate’s numbers, upside-down or right-side-up—no gain, no loss,
yet vainly generating sorrow, joy, resentment toward the monkey-keeper.

**The Ants’ Battle**

The wondrous mystery’s numinous traces—boundless,
the great earth’s whole form—shared by a single snail.
The dusty world is smaller than the horn on one’s head,
pitiable—how minutely they contend and vie.

**The Useless Tree**

The mountain tree, useless, preserves its true self,
the wild crow, incapable, yet loses its life.
The Dao’s use, daily renewed, exhausts transformation,
now apart, now united—wondrously penetrating the divine.

**Fishing for the Whale**

Great vessels, vast talents—not easily sought,
raising the pole in the blue sea, baiting with an ox.
How could I be one to scoop up the stern?
Squatting for three years—never once taking the hook.

**The Fly Whisk**

No sprouting branch bears tortoise hair,
in hand, gnats and horseflies flee at the shadow.
Raised to show others, forming a seal,
sitting, one watches wind and waves rise from level ground.

**The Fan**

A fan of woven bamboo, tortoise-hair whisk—both serve,
the rhinoceros-horn brush too coarse, too vulgar to inscribe.
A numinous breeze follows the hand, serene and fitting,
autumn moon, distant peaks—pure enough to cradle in the palm.

**Self-Understanding**

Worldly affairs, a swirling storm—vast as clouds,
one gourd, one robe, long carried at my side.
Moving or still, unbound by constraint,
a free wanderer—east, west, south, north.

**The Daoist Scriptures**

Some say Daoists have no scriptures,
only five thousand words and no more.
So I compose this verse to mock them:
The master sits in silent dignity, no words to speak,
his retinue of attendants clamoring, loud and boisterous.
Where sound fades and form dissolves, beyond all speech,
even the ink of sea and mountain cannot capture the whole.

**Planting the Lotus**

Breaking through the green moss, planting a jade lotus,
a single point of perfect clarity pierces the heavens.
Gazing down from the seat of the highest realm,
sun, moon, and stars revolve directly below.

**Three Fitting Traits**

Serene, still, empty—this body dwells in such space,
fitting to be foolish, fitting to be clumsy, fitting to be poor.
The true message of peace beyond the dust—
not something to speak of in ordinary terms.

**Illusion and Transformation**

All things to man are but a monkey’s play,
the work of transformation ceaseless, peddling what tower?
The foolish child idly toys with them,
clay dogs, earthen carts—shattered and done.

**The Mechanism of Change**

The mechanism of change, too ruthless toward things,
not allowing even a moment for the eye to blink.
Lift the head—still the tail,
in an instant, broken; in an instant, made whole.

**Clinging to Life**

Mouths clamor day after day, demanding food to fill them,
bodies year after year, wrapped in layers of clothing.
What good does all this striving finally bring?
Only to be sent to the barren wilds, buried beneath the earth.

**Fleeting Life**

This fleeting life, all contained within a hundred years,
after all the toil and labor—utterly empty in the end.

**This Foul and Reeking Mass**

Alas this foul and reeking mass—
how it disturbs the master’s house.
A idle frame, cobwebs and dust gather on walls,
old age brings sloth, yet poverty no longer chafes.

Yet this one thing proves hard to gain:
in the land of water and clouds, to set the idle self free.

**The Poetry Demon**

The poetry demon lurks nearby, too lazy to read,
clumsy and dull, as if all feeling were forgot.
Yet seated in these peaceful days,
it drives men to be called oxen and horses.

**As Before**

The poetry demon has now struck its flag,
only to fall into madness over *Nanhua*’s old scrolls.
Break this seed of delusion,
and in the land of white clouds, laugh with glee.

**Bookworm**

For forty years I played the bookworm,
now suddenly I feel old age’s sloth.
Who knew this bit of leisure would be so hard to come by?
It vexes the old master with his furrowed brow.

**Ailing**

Ailing, I cling to my love of quiet,
yet fine books still ensnare me like sages’ demons.
This useless talent, hidden away—
what can be done for this affliction above and below?

**Mechanisms**

These few mechanisms bring little suffering,
move too slow and you’ll never arrive, too fast and you’ll pass by.
From now on, let it all go—ask no more,
and sing a song of peace and prosperity.

**Illusory Form**

To take illusory form as real is to be trapped,
leap from the cage and walk the level path.
Creation grants a head start—
better than clinging to the pine of transformation.

**Time to Rest**

With white hair, one must hasten to cultivate,
once the body is roughly tended, it’s time to rest.
Keep the field of the heart pure and still, ever at peace,
lest you be unprepared when the Old Lord of Yan calls.

**Yellow Registers**

Arranging yellow registers to aid orphaned souls,
once aided, those souls remain as before.
Ancestors cannot return,
yet for millennia, men rush about for their descendants.

**True Vision**

With intent, the dust of the brush may be cut off, yet remains,
with resolve, words may be forgotten, yet intent lingers.
One day, the true eye will open wide—
what then of speech or brush?

**Empty Hall**

In the empty hall, none ask of sitting or lying,
the wondrous workings of mechanisms are known only to oneself.
Fame and power, like water, fade to stillness—
only in old age does one find this advantage.

**Peaceful Dwelling**

A livelihood roughly secured brings peaceful dwelling,
free from care, one strolls the level path.
At the edge of transcendence, do not distinguish between immortal and mortal—
all alike trace the gourd’s outline.

**Heaven’s Balance**

Mayfly, *mingling*, and great pillars alike,
short and long, all follow Heaven’s balance.
Now at seventy, few ask of me—
what care I for the years ahead?

**Divine Steed**

Steadily riding the divine steed, the dull corpse-chariot,
east, west, south, north—each day renewed.
Dragged here and there, as if led by the ear,
yet the master remains without kin or stranger.

**Pearl of Nature**

A single pearl of luminous nature,
originally lacking nothing, nor with excess.
Keep it at home, lest green dust veil it—
let its divine radiance shine through the Great Void.

**Six-Character Quatrains**
*Clouds and Mountains Collection, Scroll Four*
Composed by Zhenchang the Perfected, Ji Zhi

**Six-Character Quatrain**
For the Leader of the Needle-and-Guard Assembly

**Swift as Lightning**

Swift as lightning, the witty thrust—
unblocked, the gates and apertures all-round.
Yet even perfected skill, it seems,
cannot endure from ancient times to now.

**Same as Above**

Beyond the mechanism, free and unbound,
the true body wrought in perfect harmony.
Its wondrous workings span within and without—
the divine edge threads through empty space.

**Expressing My Feelings**

Wind clear, clouds drift and scatter,
earth vast, the void serene and still.
A crow’s script, a few lines take flight—
no matter if they rend the mystery.

**Lone Moon**

Howling winds, long and desolate,
rustling emptiness, all at peace.
Ten thousand miles of boundless sky—
a single wheel of the lone moon, bright and full.

**Dream and Illusion**

Black hair and rosy cheeks soon fade,
the golden rooster and white sun urge on.
Seeing through the realm of dreams and illusions,
one returns to the land of water and clouds.

**Peace of Mind**

Mountains stand towering, unmoved,
rivers flow ceaselessly, ever at ease.
If only the mind could rest so—
why trouble to knock at the mystery’s gate?

**Double Mystery**

Ever open the gate of double mystery,
yet the deluded ask of clouds and mud.
The fleshly eye retains its film—
seeking the *maṇi* beyond the eyelid’s reach.

**Time**

Stretch an arm—time is already lost,
turn the head—worldly affairs dissolve to void.
Common things, phantom forms, all must end,
but the bitter sea of delusion knows no bounds.

**Red Dust**

Red dust rolls at your feet,
white waves churn in the heart’s field.
Drowned in the surging flood—
how could one roam the Purple Court?

**White Tiger**

White Tiger, Azure Dragon—no need to speak,
the cinnabar furnace, lead tripod—no need to elaborate.
Fortunate to wander the crimson towers and jade groves,
a golden flask of emerald wine, fragrant and sweet.

**Sun and Moon**

Sun and moon rise and set east and west,
Heaven and Earth ascend and descend in chaos.
The true master silently weighs depth and shallowness—
floating life clings to greed and wrath.

**Form and Fate**

No grasping, no greed, no attachment,
no passion, no joy, no sorrow.
This world, this form, this fate—
fit to be foolish, fit to be dull, fit to cease.

**Moon’s Wheel**

The moon’s wheel turns, icy and clear,
all sounds fade into silence.
No need for scattered human shadows—
profoundly, it pierces the boundless.

**Turning Wheel**

The turning wheel of many lives, vast kalpas,
scheming a hundred plans, a thousand ways.
The eight consciousnesses, seven emotions toy—
the four births, six paths bear the burden.

**Sitting Long**

Moonlight spills through the curtain, pale and bright,
wind stirs the desk mat, crisp and cold.
Sitting long, frozen in boundless stillness—
unaware of self or world, what land is this?

**Truth and Falsehood**

In colors, glue and indigo mix,
in water, salt and bitterness blend.
Truth and falsehood strive to divide—
look up, and Chang’an is nowhere in sight.

**Spiritual Clarity**

Stillness leaves not a speck of dust,
the three realms dissolve into vast obscurity.
Neither self nor other can be found—
spiritual clarity penetrates the nothingness.

**Action and Stillness**

Now still, now moving, without resistance,
filling valleys and gullies, one with dust.
Neither thing nor mortal nor sage—
able to be spirit, ghost, or man.

**The Present**

The present—how can one abide in it?
The future—unthinkable to ponder.
Examine the self before you—
to stir the mind is to ask of clouds and mud.

**Family Tradition**

Pines and chrysanthemums linger on the three paths,
windows and doors bright with the six likenesses.
The Great Peace’s work leaves no trace—
yet the pure and upright family tradition endures.

**Heavenly Truth**

Step back from the clamor of fame and gain,
a leisurely self in the land of water and clouds.
Following fate, not mired in mortal falsity,
understanding life, one delights in heavenly truth.

**Karmic Consciousness**

Originally pure and still, yet unenlightened,
karmic consciousness churns without end.
Chasing phenomena, the mind hardens like iron,
following the current, the nature tangles like hemp.

**Chasing the New**

Night’s abyss—boats move, houses change,
day’s chariot—wheels turn, chasing the new.
Seeking fish in green wood is folly,
carving a mark to find the sword—vain toil.

**Awareness**

Hearing, seeing, sensing, knowing—four afflictions,
profound darkness, dull silence—much folly.
The seeker drums to catch the fugitive,
grasping, waits for the hare by the stump.

**The Three Teachings**

To be Daoist, Confucian, or Buddhist—
moon in water, reflections in a mirror, three images.
All transmitted from this very place—
why choose between yellow caps and shaven crowns?

*Clouds and Mountains Collection, Scroll Four*
*Five-Character Quatrains*
Composed by Zhenchang the Perfected, Ji Zhi

**Five-Character Quatrain**
*For the Brambles*

**For the Brambles**

Brambles cleared, yet troubles never end,
orchids planted, yet no bloom they lend.
The old garden’s blossoms close their hue,
pines and chrysanthemums—piteous view.

**The True Listener**

The stove’s chime lingers, fragrance stays,
the lamp’s green flame now faintly sways.
A broken string once more is strung—
through ages past, true listeners are few.

**Truth and Delusion**

Delusion fades, truth yet returns,
the heart emptied, nature’s sphere turns.
All rivers merge into the sea,
all lights abide within the sky.

**Wisdom and Cunning**

Wisdom and cunning—clumsy guise,
keen wit and brightness—fool’s disguise.
A thousand ages’ meaning deep,
not lightly known to those who sleep.

**Ailing Eyes**

Ailing eyes see but the world’s guise,
a dust-stained heart still seeks ties.
Like seals carved by fleas’ whim,
comings and goings—endless dim.

**Clinging to Forms**

Clinging to forms, the Way’s denied,
seeking words, the truth won’t abide.
Unable to grasp and lift it clear,
they only raise their brows in leer.

**Candle Flame**

The candle plays with wind-tossed flame,
the chest upends like waves untamed.
If no safe ground is sought to stand,
how will birth and death be tamed?

**The Veiled Heart**

Seek not within the shroud’s embrace,
nor labor over form’s display.
Mastery of past and present lore—
yet the original heart slips away.

**Turning Back**

No need to probe the moon in streams,
nor grasp at flowers in empty air.
The feet move not by constant will—
turn back, and home is ever there.

**Past and Present**

A moment’s parting—past and now,
a glance transforms the old to new.
A mass of hollow, fleeting show,
yet fame and gain still men pursue.

**Worldly Trivia**

Why record the dust’s endless din?
Fleeting life is not worth pride.
Plant instead the shadowless tree,
prune the willow of passion’s tide.

**Birth and Death**

Willow fluff rises on the wind,
flowers drift upon the stream.
Past and present know no bounds—
birth and death have their own seam.

**The Dust-Stained Heart**

The dust-stained heart burns like a flame,
worldly affairs tangle like hemp.
Unmindful of time’s fleeting flight,
they chase the falling petals’ tramp.

**The Inexhaustible Treasury**

Drained dry—the sea of right and wrong,
leveled—the mountain of self and other.
The Inexhaustible Treasury stands alone.

**Breaking Through the Inexhaustible Treasury**

Break through the Inexhaustible Treasury,
leap beyond the pass of passion’s chain.

**Love and Desire**

Love and desire—floating clouds that veil the radiant sun,
frost-laden winds that wither autumn’s orchid.
If love and desire remain uncast,
how can the heart’s lord find peace again?

**Temptation’s Blind**

Temptation’s blind may lure the pheasant,
profit and desire corrode the mind.
Within the cinnabar field lies a numinous thing—
neglect it, and thorns will rise and bind.

**Worldly Affairs**

Worldly affairs know no bounds,
household cares stretch endlessly.
If you seek no place of rest,
when will toil ever cease to be?

**Purity**

Purity is the true and natural state,
adapting to all, it enters the divine.
No need to blow the warming breath—
the frozen valley revives to spring on its own.

**Graying Temples**

Graying temples speckled white,
crimson complexion fades to sere.
No one asks of age’s call—
what excuse can you interpose?

**Birth and Death**

Dwelling within the gate of birth and death,
walking the path of rebirth’s wheel.
This heart grows accustomed to its comings and goings—
how could it pause to ask what lies ahead?

**Accumulated Dust**

Accumulated dust—dim and bleak,
the long night—black and vast.
Before the Three Essentials are grasped,
how can the Five Senses be made right?

**Yin and Yang**

Yin and Yang are the great craftsmen,
Heaven and Earth the potter’s wheel.
Transforming, they change with the times,
pursuing life, they renew each day.

**The Great Dao**

The Great Dao is profound and obscure,
misguided men seek it upside-down.
It is not far from the self at all—
only the original heart remains.

**Colophon to *Cloud and Mountain Collection*, Volume Four**
Composed by Perceiver of the Constant, the Realized One, Ji Zhizhen.

**Colophon to *Seven Perfected Ones’ Portraits***

To capture the true likeness in painting—
this is reverence, this is devotion.
Yet of this very visage,
what else could I imitate?

The supreme lineage masters
bear no dual aspect.
The moon’s reflection in a thousand rivers—
one luminous roundness, undivided.

Primordial and indestructible,
their true forms remain unchanged.
Who has beheld them? Who has transmitted them?
All dwell beneath Heaven yet fathom not its height,
all tread the Earth yet exhaust not its depth.

Neither ancient nor modern,
neither fleeting nor enduring.
Tracing the source, following close—yet the steps never cease;
racing ahead, leaving all dust behind—yet gazing back in vain.

Kuang Qu, wishing to speak, forgets his words;
Ji Xian, self-lost, flees.
Li Zhu wipes his eyes yet sees no trace,
the Yellow Emperor listens to Ying yet discerns no right or wrong.

The formless seeks them in nothingness,
the fleeting carves them into being.
Connoisseurs strain their minds in vain,
sophists seal their lips in silence.

Gazing at the vastness, one sighs toward Ruo—
how could mere brush and ink presume to stain them?

*Cloud and Mountain Collection, Volume Four—End*
*Cloud and Mountain Collection, Volume Five—Lyrics*

**Lyrics by Perfected One of Knowing the Constant, Ji Zhizhen**

**Jade Terrace, First Tier**

A speck of primordial true-qi veiled by deluded thoughts,
summons forth an illusory body.
Mayfly and morning mushroom, fleeting passions and perceptions,
entangled in the clouds of habit’s confusion.

A thousand-zhang pit of fire, its snare ever poised—
ten thousand deceptions in swirling yellow dust and white waves.
Spread wantonly, sinking into filth’s mire,
drowning in the bitter sea’s depths.

So tangled—
life and death, gain and loss,
right and wrong, glory and shame, all cling to suffering’s wheel.
Yet sometimes awakening comes: the block of ignorance shatters,
the eye’s aperture widens like a wheel.

The pearl of nature pierces through—
then one trusts the treasuring light,
encompassing heaven and earth.
From this, the spirit communes of itself:
a celestial realm where night never falls,
a grotto-heaven of eternal spring.

**Mu Lan Hua Man**

Sun-crow and moon-hare race,
darting in and out swift as shuttles.
More still—the shadow-play of floating life,
puppets on strings of illusion,
manipulated by stern hands.

Breaths of praise and blame shift forms in ceaseless flux,
stirring up a storm from flat ground.
All mere fly-heads and snail-horns,
yet through the ages, churned like madness.

Wasted time—
awakened with a start, the dust-dream shatters,
laughing hee-hee.
Realizing the original, primal beginning,
the numinous clarity remains—
neither less nor more.

No need to hoard or stain further:
facing wild clouds and stream-water,
sing mountain songs.
Beneath the moon, walking alone,
staff bearing rain-hat and misty straw cloak.

**Second**

Mocking the illusions of this life,
encountering desolation—
the world’s path a sheep’s gut,
human hearts like ginger roots,
hardness turned to softness.

Frenzied, white ants battle in drunken fury,
seeking marquisate shadows in locust and sandalwood.
One awakens—yellow millet still uncooked,
a hundred years of light vanish like smoke.

Pursuing—
past and present, ancient and now,
what has been achieved? All mere towers of nothing.
Examining wealth and honor as floating clouds,
merit and fame as painted cakes,
this floating life a retching emptiness.

Clearly seen as false before the eyes—
then with one blade, severed in two,
no longer swept along the current.
Leaping free from the waves of delusion’s ford,
the moonlit boat returns across the blue sea.

**Third**

At peaks of finest beauty,
thatched huts are raised,
companions to verdant pines.
With herb gardens and lingzhi fields,
plowing clouds and angling moon,
fragrant mists and sacred winds arise.

Leaning on the rail to gaze upon the mortal sea,
drumming waves a thousand fathoms high
merge with the boundless sky.
How oft have Penglai’s shallows blurred,
where dragons and depths confound.

The sacred seeds of Three Mountains yet remain,
while the deaf and blind seek without cease.
Mocking Queen Mother’s peaches,
Anqi’s left-behind jujubes,
lures for mere children.
Ren Gong’s great black carp still thrives,
its hook suspended,
fifty spans of rainbow drawn.
Squatting unseen for three years—
when shall the fish-like one appear?

**Shuilong Yin**

Myriad dust-laden burdens, layer upon layer,
all at once shed like a knot untied.
Blue shoes and staff,
patched cloak of quail feathers,
light and swift upon the body.
North and south, east and west,
a drifting duckweed, wind-tossed twig—
what hinders going or staying?
Permitted to lift the hairpin in laughter,
to sing while walking, dance while standing,
no trifling cares to cling to the heart.

No inquiry into the realm of Pot Heaven.
Who then distinguishes
the mundane from the beyond?
Like clouds, like water,
wandering freely, unconstrained,
roaming at will.
In a turn of thought, worldly aspirations—
all green illusions—
crumble to ruin in the end.
Wait until that time when interest wanes,
amid clouds and rosy mists,
to convene the assembly of non-action.

**Second**

This body, fortunate to escape the snares of dust,
should seek a place of pure seclusion.
Mountain spirits beckon me,
peaks like screens, ridges like curtains,
encircling verdant hues.
White stones and limpid springs,
bamboo pavilions and pine-lined paths,
grass halls at the forest’s edge.
Choosing a steadfast height,
storing wind and nurturing moon—
who then inquires of the human world?

Surpassing all the wonders of Pot Heaven,
mocking Peach Blossom Spring’s
fallen petals and flowing waters.
Here, at times, divine immortals gather,
colored clouds swaying.
Laughing over the azure waves,
how many turns of dust and ashes
vanish in a snap of the fingers?
Tipping the golden flask of jade wine,
a whale’s draught swallowed whole—
drunk in blissful intoxication.

**Third**

Rise and fall, survival and ruin through the ages,
fallen blossoms strewn, fragrant winds sweeping.
Vast the bitter sea,
waves a thousand fathoms high,
endless entanglements.
All lost in pristine innocence,
adrift in the dusty realm,
clinging in delusion and folly.
Since parting from the Mystic Capital,
wandering and turning,
who now asks of the Chang’an road?

Only the thought of unfinished merit and fame
gathers brows in sorrow,
bitterly entwining the heart.
When shall the three fields’ numinous splendor
and life-giving lingzhi herbs be attained?
Rosy clouds and jade essences,
bamboo winds and pine moon,
the alchemical furnace and elixir’s grace.
Refining deep roots and firm stems,
to attain long life and enduring vision,
forever free from decay.

**Leijiang Yue**

At the outset of Dao-learning,
the Dao has no form—
how then to tread its traces?
Only within the numinous source, the square inch of the heart,
embodying the primal truth of the original beginning.
Stirring the turbid to reveal the pure,
illuminating the real and excising the false,
sweeping away all perversities.
Delusive clouds disperse,
secretly connecting the void and full beyond the mundane.

The master in the hall practices non-action,
the pivot of the cosmos turns,
not permitting the slightest dust to approach.
Directly entering the true realm of Nothing-Whatsoever,
radiant and jade-like, towering peaks stand.
Auspicious qi surges and harmonizes,
propitious light blazes resplendent,
all dust-laden qualities forgotten.
Roaming and feasting at ease,
life as boundless as heaven and earth.

**Second**

The startled deer in dreams,
playing with this floating life—
gains and losses, joys and sorrows, partings and meetings.
Even clear discernment is but a dream,
ever turning, ever sunk in stupor.
The chicken’s beak of human sentiment,
the sheep’s gut of worldly paths,
each vying for prominence.
Wielding the whip, raising the oar—
all the same, trudging on official roads.

One day, sudden awakening, the heart turned to ashes,
the snares of dust seen through,
only then believing past errors.
In the tranquil land beneath the pines,
clouds and waters make an emotionless pact.
Time at ease,
days and months carefree,
all bonds cast off.
On the southern branch of the locust tree,
watching the yellow ants at their revels.

**Third**

Merit and fame, wealth and honor,
like an untethered rope,
binding all heroes and stalwarts.
From ancient times to now, a shadow play—
in an instant, survival and ruin, rise and fall.
Silken wives and learned sons,
painted halls and golden jades,
luring men to covet and steal.
Fleeting splendor, mere specks—
how long do they last?

Creating heavy karmic ills,
changing the very skin of the head,
enduring bitter trials through countless kalpas.
How much better to withdraw early, to awaken in time,
to rest the mad heart at last.
Breaking through the world’s net,
turning the Mystic Pass,
attaining the true immortal’s formula.
When the work is complete, returning—
a bright moon over the river.

**Xiqian Ying**

To illuminate the true essence.

**Water Melody**

Sweeping away the myriad distractions,
the lost sheep’s forked paths.
Shedding the skin and fur,
only the true remains,
utterly forsaking past steps.
A jade lotus unfurls,
untouched by the slightest dust.
Gathering crimson snow,
drinking the dark frost as before,
the elixir of spirit gathers in perfection.
Now free from doubt,
alone in the emerald haze,
planting the rootless tree by hand.
The luminous qi spans the sky,
the numinous source bathes in moonlight,
radiance spreading in an instant.
Ten thousand bushels of pearls cannot compare—
firmly guarded, securely stored.
Spirits cannot fathom,
demons cannot summon,
when merit is complete, mounting the phoenix to depart.

---

**Water Melody (Second)**

Seated in idleness, a stubborn habit,
what more could cloud and stream offer?
The heart’s raiment washed clean of dust,
another fine livelihood unfolds.
No need to choose—
whether the immortal courts of Yingzhou,
or the bustling streets of flowers and willows—
everywhere, radiance abounds.
Ask not of dragon and tiger,
of white snow or yellow sprout.

No indulgence in poetry,
no chatter of wine,
no plucking of blossoms.
The original face is the public affair—
why boast to others?
By day, gazing upon the old mountain’s scenes,
by night, covered by the stars of the dark sky,
a hundred patches shroud the clouds.
Neither spirits nor ghosts can fathom—
in an instant, filling the rivers and sands.

**Water Melody (Third)**

Dredging the deepest pockets,
not a single coin to find.
All along, the livelihood of this life
has never mixed with the vulgar.
Like the sages deep in drink,
sobering the muddled heart’s intoxication,
with eyes like jade, gazing upon the mortal realm.
Severing the chains of profit and fame,
trampling the gates of death and life.

Feigning folly,
letting laziness loose,
indulging in play.
The six senses drag not forth—
nestled in the hollow, resting in the groove.
Yet there are extraordinary means:
gathering a slice of empty space,
so clear it chills the night’s radiance.
Grasp the meaning within—
why ask of the Three Mountains?

---

**Water Melody (Fourth)**

Rise and fall perused in green histories,
glory and disgrace a dream of yellow millet.
Fleeting as flowers, swift as lightning—
foolishly chasing, like one gone mad.
Adding feet to a painted snake,
unaware of the monkey’s taro ruse,
both sorrow and joy forgotten.
Turning back to the old homeland,
all its scenes now desolate.

A hundred years of this body—
a snap of the fingers, temples turned to frost.
If others ask, pay no heed,
bear it all in steadfast stillness.
On quiet nights, wind soft and moon bright,
facing cloud companions and rosy friends,
laughter and talk stretch long.
A bowl of heart-cleansing tea,
a petal of incense from before the kalpas.

---

**Water Melody (Fifth)**

A wanderer in foreign lands,
trampling the soft red dust.
Returning, every door and courtyard,
bamboo blinds rolled at dusk.
North and south, east and west—
how many straw sandals worn thin,
yet where to seek the root of heaven?
Ask what radiance remains—
since ancient times, the treasure alone endures.

Entering the realm of nothingness,
roaming the great desert,
crossing Kunlun’s peaks.
That message of the wind immortal—
not to be heard lightly.
Eyes dazzled by falling blossoms,
the osmanthus moon still round as ever,
piercing water without a trace.
Yet relying on the mighty Peng,
high above, it sweeps the clouds from the ridge.

---

**Remembering Elder Fayu, the Spring Patriarch**

Meeting a friend of like mind,
eyes meeting, a bond like gold and orchid.
Climbing the heavens, wandering through mist,
in perfect accord—
chicken and millet unneeded.
Often recalling beneath the *Kun Kun* Pavilion,
gazing down at the vast, boundless sea,
waving the whisk, laughing in conversation.
Rosy clouds rolled up north of Zhenyang,
clouds veiled the face of Crane Mountain.

Years pass,
affairs change,
suddenly the pact grows cold.
Straw sandals and cassia staff remain,
only the memory of knocking at the mystery’s gate.
Wishing the heart as round as the moon,
inside and out, empty and clear,
silently turning the pivot.
A single point, no difference—
a thousand miles shared in the same gaze.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (First) – Exhorting Magistrate Liu**

Dazzling eyes with empty flowers,
all tangled in ropes, bound tight.
Drowned in heaps of soft red dust,
mistaking it for true joy.
The two Lu brothers forgot their later troubles,
the two Shu officials—who saw first?
Dreaming souls follow ants to the locust court—
when will they awaken?

Rise and fall—
once witnessed, let it be.
Prosperity’s bloom
will fade and scatter.
No need for others’ urging—
best to ponder for oneself.
An ancient mirror, polished, reveals realms beyond dust,
a Sui pearl, vainly strummed to scare the eaves’ sparrows.
When enlightenment comes, turn back to the path ahead—
a pact with Penglai.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (Second)**

Rosy friends gathered,
cloud chambers met—
laughing, talking of true rest.
Amidst sweltering skies, light sweat,
hard to endure in stillness.
Ice and jade freshly set on the table,
the dark and mysterious seated, chilling the mat.
Moon cakes, from time to time, floated in golden cups,
swallowed in whale-like gulps.

Dispelling heat,
cleansing the chest.
A power most wondrous,
a divine force.
Laughing at Lu Dongbin’s windy tastes,
Zhao Zhou’s tea-side demeanor.
The Dharma realm, so clear, can be cupped in the hands,
the spirit’s vastness, boundless, light without end.
Ask of the true flavor within—
the mouth cannot speak it, yet the essence is known.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (Third)**

Ten thousand treatises, a thousand sutras—
all perused, seeking true awakening.
Testing ancient and modern deeds,
shifting to mere words, all jumbled.
Not forged within the heart,
through countless kalpas, empty and lost.
Grasping the original truth—
the spirit’s mouth cannot speak it,
where to learn?

Nothing at all,
utterly empty.
Ever pure, ever vast,
pervading the boundless.
Apply effort to nurture,
no need for reckless abandon.
Who can harmonize with the white snow and spring sun?
Village songs and festival wine vie in clamor.
See how many know the ox’s hair—
as rare as the qilin’s horn.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (Fourth)**

A hundred refinings, a thousand temperings—
what is achieved?
A heart like ice and snow.
Amidst piles of accumulated dust, shedding it all,
to reveal the moon of the mind.
Probing the root’s source to the very bottom,
no need to distinguish waves and branches.
Throughout the world, who is not a traveler?
Why speak of it?

The elixir should be secret,
the pouch tightly sealed.
Dwelling without a house,
traveling without a trace.
No more thoughts of self and others,
right and wrong, good and bad.
The parrot in the carved cage speaks,
the cuckoo on the branch sheds blood in vain.
Facing the carriages and horses of profit and fame,
the soft red dust—
guard the tongue well.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (Fifth)**

A stubborn heart—
what towering folly,
endless arising and ceasing.
Driven by the mechanisms of transformation,
so much confusion and salt.
Piling bones like mountains—what is achieved?
Delusion’s sea—hard to transcend.
Alas, the primordial spirit long buried,
entombed in kalpas of dust and sand.

Seeking liberation—
must be fierce.
Finding wise friends,
discussing ice and snow.
Apply effort to polish,
until life’s light shines clear.
Wind still, waves calm—the pond’s depths revealed,
clouds part, the moon of the sky’s heart emerges.
Ask the mute man how honey tastes—
no words to speak.

---

**Slow Song of the Red River (Sixth)**

Lost through many lives,
endless red dust veiling the eyes.
Though painstakingly seeking subtle understanding,
the form cannot bear the strain.
The monkey fondles the moon in the pond,
the fool chews the honey on the blade’s edge.
Pitiful—
entangled in the net of Dharma,
when will it end?

A swallow’s stone treasured,
a bronze plate’s sun.
Tossing jujubes,
floating duckweed.
Break through this mass—
naturally, the message will flow.
Sever the creeping vines of idle entanglement,
shatter the mad traces of the valley’s echoes.
Return to the original point—
in an instant, bear it all,
the true essence.

---

**Court of a Myriad Flowers – For the Perfect Realization**

**For the Perfect Realization (Continued)**

The whole is never lacking,
true origin never false—
how could there ever be more or less?
The numinous source spans antiquity,
of the same class as heaven and earth.
Yet pure, it is stained by the ten thousand conditions,
giving rise to feelings and perceptions,
summoning demons and guilt.
Hard to transcend—
living in vain, dying in vain,
cast adrift in the sea of suffering.

With wisdom, one seeks liberation,
but a single thought’s return to the pivot
decides enlightenment in the realm of nothingness.
Examine the original, ever-present,
the slightest deviation a distortion.
All manifestations, all phenomena—
clearly, they remain
the same old mountains and rivers.
Hold high the mirror,
then shatter it again,
clapping hands and laughing aloud.

---

**Second: Celebrating Master Li’s Eightieth Year**

The Southern Pole stores auspiciousness,
the Lesser Hidden Star manifests its sign—
at eighty, he appears in the human realm.
Water and clouds drift freely,
golden crucible refines the elixir of spirit.
Having swept clean the Grotto of Eternal Spring,
he roams carefree beyond the world’s dust,
occupying lofty leisure.
No aging—
tortoises circle, cranes encircle,
face to face, they share joy.

Deeply moved, we offer repeated prayers,
tending the warm furnace, shouldering the stove,
hoisting the sandalwood banner beyond kalpas.
Recall his primordial countenance—
not a trace of withering.
Through ancient and modern, swift as dawn and dusk,
how many times has he witnessed
the peach’s flourishing bloom?
Ever present,
golden pot of jade wine,
high feast among the ranks of immortals.

---

**Third: For Elder Li’s Longevity**

Peaches blush crimson,
apricots open pale white—
mid-spring’s scenery delights.
Do not neglect the nine-leaf lineage,
from Longyou descends the celestial perfected.
Auspicious vapors rise thickly,
treasure crucible’s incense wafts beyond kalpas.
Jade chimes resound,
their clear tones enfolding
the honored guests of the grotto’s high assembly.

This fine occasion calls for exhortation:
with immortal’s bearing and Daoist bones,
leave the dust early.
Awaken to the illusory world—
do not cling to old ways.
Behold the peach setting fruit,
the magic fungus flourishing,
envying not the sturdiest tree.
Ever thus,
deep in the grotto-heaven,
stride alone through eternal spring.

---

**Jade Butterfly**

Restless, this dreamlike existence,
a white colt flashing past the gap—
how much time remains?
Exhausting schemes and stratagems,
never a moment’s clarity.
Hoarding treachery, shifting deer for horses,
entangled in nets, inverting black and yellow—
most pitiable.
Life and death rush on,
the bitter sea boundless.

Unforgettable—
the ropes of kindness, the snares of love,
fire pits, dust nets,
shackles of profit, reins of fame.
Ever gluttonous,
unaware of temples frosting white.
Chasing mirages in scorched moats,
racing down branching paths after lost sheep.
Wandering alone—
deep in white clouds,
a single stick of heart’s incense.

---

**Second: Rustic Dwelling**

Beyond the bustle, the land remote from dust,
thatched hut shelters a minor hermit—
all affairs come to rest.
Coarse grain and wild greens suffice,
ample for leisurely wandering.
Moon lingers,
hairpin raised for a slow stroll;
wind chimes tinkle,
tears idly unshed.
For now, tarry—
wild clouds return to the peaks,
mist and water stretch across autumn.

Only keep
a few things at hand:
a quiet cloth, a joyful brush,
fine comb for the hair.
Bowl in sack, idle;
staff of blossoming cassia—
nothing more to seek.
Singing *li-lo*,
beckon the shepherd boy;
with you, the carefree gulls.
What more to worry?
Wielding the knife without hindrance,
no longer seeing the whole ox.

---

**Golden Youth Bearing the Dew Tray**

Dreamlike, the world of Jambudvīpa,
abandoning the old, chasing the new—
in an instant, the mechanism of change shifts.
Heaven and earth, a single mound of ruins,
the heart’s understanding merges with vast emptiness,
wild clouds unfurl and roll.
Entrusting to the near, the empty boat,
mirroring form in still water,
wind severs drifting threads.
The jade firmament, dustless, limpid—
blending foe and kin,
forgetting the roc and the wren.

Ever steadfast, scattered—
in this moment, grain like a quail’s, dwelling like a nest,
roaming and feasting carefree.
Hearing without sound,
seeing without color,
discarding the golden blade, shedding the film—
regarding as empty flowers.
Windows and doors retain their clarity,
erasing the traces of ox and man,
pristine radiance shines.
Beyond the mundane,
in the grotto’s mystery, ethereal and distant,
directly permitted to join the true and the pure.
Walk the level path,
shaking head, waving sleeves,
arriving drunk in the land of intoxication—
better than entering the Pavilion of High Yang.
Worldly concerns far—
floating life, in an instant, returns late.

---

**Second: Same Theme**

High assembly of cloud companions,
laughing and conversing in the world—
how many times have the sea’s waves calmed?
Heaven and earth, a single breath,
moving Jambudvīpa’s rise and fall,
the mechanism of change swift as lightning.
With a flip of the hand, existence and extinction;
with a turn of the head, gathering and scattering—
all things vain and disordered.
Playing with ants on the locust tree,
dreaming of ambitions vast and firm.
The inexhaustible treasury—
mountains as boats, secretly shifting,
hills and mounds transposed.

This human world, a ball of emptiness,
yet none recognize
the mere form imprisoned in the great kalpa,
waves of breath barely lingering.
Nature turns back from error—
within the bronze plate’s sound,
even the sun is hard to discern.
Test the golden mirror,
brush aside the misty film—
the pupil sees as usual.
Awaiting closer inspection of butterflies and moths like mountains,
pervading the dharma-realm’s numinous emptiness,
compassionate clouds suffuse all.
Only then, the true vision—
realizing the moment of action comes late.

---

**Jade Maiden Shaking the Immortal’s Girdle**

Before heaven, there was something,
never easily named—
vaguely, the primal qi’s swirling mist.
The Great Ultimate’s form emerged,
the golden chicken’s first division,
scattering into ten thousand differences.
All ensnared by form’s bondage,
indulging in restless thoughts,
schemes in a hundred directions.
Competing for fame and profit,
stirring waves, raising tides—
all for nothing, merely the four affairs.

Vainly entangled in the world,
trading bones, flipping fortunes—
what end does it serve?
Who believes the fire passed on, the old discarded,
things transformed, the new welcomed—
playing with my truth like a child’s game?
Seeing through it, shake your head,
raise your brows and laugh,
illuminating lifetimes of stagnation.
False constructions, idle rights and wrongs—
all worthless, like the wind’s flavor in the forest.
Autumn’s quiet night,
clouds gather, the sky’s expanse clear,
not a speck of dust stirs,
moon bright as water.
Ever abiding,
drunk in the shadow of the jade peach.

---

**First Branch of the East Wind**

Far from the cage, the empty boat untethered,
unfolding the true delight of leisure.
Never envying
the honor of the muddy ditch,
never envying
the measured steps of the golden chamber.
Heaven and earth, surveyed in a glance,
shoulders and windows thrown open,
the courtyard’s thoroughfare bright and clear.
Gathering robes, entering directly into nothingness,
doffing the cap, sitting boldly with legs spread.

Neither do I envy
the coiled dragon’s ascent or phoenix’s flight,
nor do I inquire
of libraries of letters or arsenals of arms.
To act—what act, what non-action?
To ponder—what thought, what non-thought?
Serene and plain,
moving through the world,
settled in ease,
turning to my old garden,
commanding the radiant breeze—
returning, I seem to regret the lateness of dusk.

**Second Branch: In Praise of Tea**

The sealed wrapper splits,
the dragon cake is broken open,
the mechanism of the tea tree foreseen.
Jade lads prepare it,
fragrant mist lightly rising,
silver kettles draw forth
the sacred spring’s fresh offering.
A master’s touch—
bristling beard, striking
the whale-wave to foam.
By this gentleman’s
modest skill,
jade blossoms finely float
upon the bowl’s surface.

This passage
lifts the entire koan—
fit for savoring,
no need for flattery or urging.
It scours the dust from the heart,
stilling all residue,
unlocking the moon of the mind,
a single slice of pure cold.
Grass demons, swept away like lightning,
within and without gleaming,
the original truth alone revealed.
Meeting Lu Tong,
hand in hand in Penglai,
lingering in the crystal palace.

**Slow Song of the Yangtze Spirit: In Praise of Incense**

The Jade Lad reports the dawn’s end.
The immortal dream breaks—
from the land of Hua Xu’s great peace.
By the plain screen, the golden censer warms,
ash cradling the cloud-heart’s hollow whiteness.
The imperial seal splits—
a single petal lifted, pure fragrance brims,
steeping all in mist, the numinous void unbarred.
It drifts through the Three Realms in harmony,
piercing height and depth, penetrating metal and stone.
The divine land first congeals in the jade cauldron,
recalling how on the unbudded branch,
a trace of spring’s hue once glimmered.
How many know—
the dust-bound world obstructs,
denying even the gourd’s clear sight?
Qi dense and unbroken,
the high immortals of cavern-palaces all silently meet.
Butterflies and bees swarm in vain,
nowhere to alight—
ethereal, trailing threads congeal in emptiness,
entering the vast sky as one.

---

**Second Stanza: After the Lotus Pond’s Rain Ceases**
On the wave’s surface leans
jade blossoms mirrored in limpid clarity.
The lad is bidden to pluck them,
silver scoops to steep—
the fairy of Mount Gu She, frozen in purity.
In silence it speaks:
the vast earth and boundless sky all gathered in a pinch,
no great nor small,
drawn in to be stored in the *pattra* leaf.
Unfurled, the true light of subtle medicine,
the dust-sand realm
fully awakens at dawn.
A single stem, darkly transmitted since antiquity,
emerges from the realm of sound and form,
extending its vast and boundless tongue.
Do not discriminate—
the finest particle received,
entering the eye as golden flakes.
Brushing away the near and far,
each and every thing holds boundless treasuries.
Idle peach and plum trees
leak their true countenances.
Who now dares to take up the task,
entrusting it to the moon on the flower’s tip?

---

**Joy of the Level Sky**
Self-enslaved by form,
cold and hunger assail,
no different from superfluous growths.
Probe the empty and profound from the primal origin—
there is a single point, round and bright, boundless.
Dust-green stretches vast,
like a thousand miles of clear sky,
illusion spawns cloudy veils.
Rely on this numinous wind,
blowing all away in an instant, leaving no trace.
Coming—suddenly,
going—wherever,
following that speck,
be it mouse liver or insect limb.
The great furnace of transformation,
existence and extinction alike—
what beyond this is to be feared?
Meeting demons or obstacles,
riding the divine steed or corpse-cart,
who reckons departure or stay?
Sit steadfast, forgetful of care,
from beginning to end, rely on this resolve.

---

**Spring Comes from Heaven Above**
Layer upon layer of dust.
Alas, since ancient times, endlessly,
none awaken from their burial.
In the arena of profit and fame,
amid the throng of self and others,
they recognize only this bodily form.
Recall the original single point—
who lacks a share?
All are immortal material.
Yet they hesitate, suspect.
Call them a thousand times, drunk,
they refuse to turn their heads.
When will they startle awake in dreams,
seeing through all that came before,
the white ants’ court and locust tree?
In the depths of the grotto-heaven,
with rosy-cloud friends and mist companions,
they converse, tasting ice and snow.
Facing the purple mushrooms of the secluded garden,
fragrant winds enfold,
green wine pours into cups.
Truly carefree!
With dragons coiling and tigers circling,
they sink into drunkenness in Penglai.

---

**Second Stanza: The Emperor’s Birthday**
Heaven bestows auspicious omens.
Now the Nine-Five Dragon soars,
the great enterprise flourishes.
Turning the vast creation,
setting the cosmos in order,
thunder roars and lightning flashes to compose the pattern.
Toward the jade capital and golden towers,
the mighty sound shakes—
gall bladders of distant lands burst in fear.
Surpassing the age of Yao and Tang.
Surely the true conjunction arrives,
the four seas at peace and prosperous.
Why speak of all under heaven?
Even the lowliest creatures,
all rely on his aid and rectification.
Upright as the *qiao* orchid,
sunflowers turn their hearts,
how to repay the grace of his beneficent radiance?
The stove’s orchid perfumes the auspicious mist,
praying for the yellow palace,
branches and leaves united in fragrance.
We pray for our emperor:
may the dragon’s chart stand firm forever,
his sacred longevity boundless.

---

**Third Stanza: The Snail-Shell World of Existence**
In the ebb and flow of a single qi,
winding and cycling.
Within the lightning’s shadow,
amid the spark of flint,
birth and extinction in such fleeting moments.
All exhaust themselves in restless striving,
name and profit
clashing to the death.
Self-destructing—
for a mass of illusion,
a hundred kinds of schemes.
The eyelash before the eye unseen,
mistaking the false for true,
utterly deluded and stubborn.
Peace is hard to encounter,
the true Dao hard to meet—
recognize the old homeland of days past.
Arriving in the land of nothingness,
treading clouds and mist,
gathering jade medicines and magic mushrooms.
Joining the immortal ranks,
celebrating long spring in heaven above,
descending to fill the mortal realm.

---

**Fourth Stanza: Fat Horses and Light Robes**
Wealth and honor enfold merit and fame,
the heart drunk as if intoxicated.
The spring dream of the pillow—
who believes in the roc’s journey,
the vast wings soaring southward?
Ensnared by the illusions of the present,
vainly entangled,
bearing the yoke and carrying the burden.
What more can be endured?
Chasing the fly’s head and snail’s horn,
bitterly, greedily craving.
One day, eyes open at last,
in the arena of fame and profit,
they halt their chariots and rest their steeds.
Beyond the whip’s reach,
shattering the web of doubt,
laughing at the evening’s four and morning’s three.
The original single point appears,
serene within—
the autumn moon on the cold pool.
Within this, they contemplate.
Listen to the golden lads’ ballads,
the jade maidens’ profound discourse.

---

**Fifth Stanza: Withered Wood and Cold Ash**
Dwelling in a rustic cottage,
a thatched hall in the wilds,
secluded among pines and forests.
The land remote, the people quiet,
moon bright, wind clear,
windows and doors free of dust’s touch.
There is a natural message,
silver radiance gleaming,
pearls and jade, coral and gems.
Truly carefree!
Behold the dragon coiling in the golden tripod,
the phoenix dancing on the cinnabar terrace.
The whole world drunk on fame and profit—
who else, relying on the roc’s journey,
breaks through the dense net?
If these words are believed,
stalwart men,
do not let go and return empty-handed.
Recognizing emptiness as illusion,
how can it be accomplished?
In vain, they tarnish immortal material.
Return early!
Attend the grand gathering of the peach banquet,
laughing and conversing in Penglai.

---

**Rain-Scattered Flowers**
A single numinous source,
lucid and penetrating,
the dust of passions from kalpas past.
There is an unending celestial realm of wind and things,
existing since time immemorial.
The jade qilin squats and roars,
the stone maiden faces the bed, discoursing.
The sea lad’s faint念,
the vast sky’s clear snow,
does not descend like gulls in drought.
Upright as the *qiao* orchid, wriggling as insects,
all drawn into the breath.
The cold valley revives spring for me.
Moreover, there is—
the Yue’s *ling* thinking of the past,
the Chu’s *sa* summoning souls.
All imagine the bronze tray and wax torches,
the late glow of the *mohan*’s lingering fragrance.
The divine elixir already perfected,
the dark pearl intact,
silent and dim.

---

**Second Stanza: Amid Forests and Mountains, In Marketplaces Everywhere**
Heavenly wandering in every place of mystery and void.
Never permitted the slightest addition or subtraction,
fully endowed, nothing lacking.

The lacquer bucket sinks sweetly amidst the杂,
the playhouse makes its own muddle.
Dry bones lean on the armrest,
who questions the azure sky?
Vainly they deploy their breath.
Forms and names lodge in the ear,
observing the thread of the true visage—
neither lead nor mercury nor pearl.
Though raised in a hundred guises,
the wondrous place remains unpatterned.

Who possesses the skill of Wheelwright Bian,
the craft of wind and the art of whitewash?
Every thing in every aspect,
vast or fine, great or small,
each and all thusness.
Its Third #1

Twenty years of inquiry—
do you recall our dialogue
amid the emerald groves of Shanyang?
Laughter wrapped in Penglai’s shallows,
where land swelled into waves.
Startled joy at the unharmed divine root,
the twin luminous jade trees beheld together.
Jostling within the realm,
through the boundless long night,
we spoke of shared delight.
My remaining years drift,
a hollow boat on rivers and seas,
a single leaf untethered to cycles.
All grown old now—
a thousand li of passes and rivers,
meeting to converse is rare indeed.

I laugh at my rosy mists and colic,
half a lifetime spent in wind and moon’s long leisure.
At parting, may the cloud-root and water-bone
face each other with gladdened countenance.

*Wang Hai Chao*
Spring ice first companions,
the long river surges,
peach blossoms green the swelling waves.
If the Sea Lord deigns to come,
Feng Yi smiles to himself,
the numinous spring retreats as magpies return.
Painting’s interest wanes.
Then sever the hanging torrent,
turn the mechanism’s wheel.
Looking back at worldly affairs—
what binds and distracts like ants in cycles?

The lotus-world’s dream shatters.
Gazing at cloud-veiled peaks,
moon embellishes the mountain’s face.
Fragrant grasses spread their mat,
towering pines bow like canopies,
peaks rise beside the jade balustrade.
Heaven and earth so vast—
just then, unbound and at ease,
hearts in golden covenant.
A message to those who’ve achieved their work:
in the finest place, do not grow cold.

*Dong Xian Ge*
A hundred years of light and shadow,
green temples fade in an instant.
The bustling, toiling life—
a sea of right and wrong.
Consider all matters of existence and extinction,
concealment and revelation, fullness and emptiness, rise and fall—
all silently heed the true arbiter within the mystery.

Why, like dogs and flies,
torment yourself for fleeting fame and meager profit,
entangled in ten thousand schemes?
In leisure, take one step—
do not recklessly branch out.
On the level ground of Penglai, old friends remain.
Let the spirit wind sweep away the dust of passion,
you must break through the suspended barrier of life and death.
Then grasp the boundless use of the dark pearl,
attaining carefree wandering,
coming and going without hindrance.

Its Second
A thousand demons, ten thousand hardships,
accustomed to sinking in the bitter sea.
Willow chains drag the whole body,
forcing and hauling.
Recognizing the eaves’ drip—
a single floating pivot comes and goes,
yet you fail to see through the empty flower’s illusion.
Drunk from dawn to dusk,
who knows the true spirit inherent in the original?
Ten thousand dusts entangle.
Awakening from the dream, sober from wine,
open your blue eyes and look closely.
In leisure, observe time with the heart.
The skull fundamentally knows no east or west,
still playing with endless kalpas of rebirth.
But awaken later and return the mind—
do not wait until the western mountain,
when the sun sinks and the sky darkens.

*Yue Zhong Xian*
The vast numinous spring,
from the prior heaven’s indistinctness,
defies depiction.
Far from imagination,
no rabbit horns or turtle hairs—
each and all distinctly bright.
A hundred guises presented,
all extraneous, waves rising without wind.
Sever the path of the lost sheep,
mountain clouds and wild waters,
mutually forgetting one another.

The divine light shines without direction,
revealing ash-cold earth patterns,
stretching across heaven and earth.
Lower your head, set down your staff—
strike wood, no sound;
knock on emptiness, it resounds.
No need to seek the formless.
Attain freedom,
unrestrained and unbound.
Trusting the hand to pluck it,
use the wish-fulfilling pearl’s inexhaustible treasury.

*Fen Die Er*
Chewing waxen dusts of passion,
who knows their bland tastelessness?
What tower’s farce—
a play of emptiness.
Utterly uncomprehending,
a dream’s life and world.
Helplessly sprawled,
deploying mechanisms—
what use in the end?
Awaken later, let all rest,
seek a lasting plan.
Then gather the mind,
break through human falsity.
Far from the cage,
cast off worldly things,
embrace the cave-heaven’s fine essence.
Knit a cloud hermitage,
facing the western mountains,
where ten thousand peaks congeal in emerald.

Its Second
Meager profit and fleeting fame,
desperately striving forward.
Time, too, silently urges on.
The puppet stage,
jostling and performing,
becomes a public case.
When the play ends,
all is but ashes—
unworthy of a second look.
The wind carries the morning bell,
startling awake the dream’s blue eyes.
Awareness reveals all before
as mere illusion.
In the fire pit,
a stable place—
freedom’s people choose.
Return early,
do not wait until
the sun sinks and the sky darkens.

Its Third

Green temples and crimson cheeks—
how endure the twin losses of crow and hare?
Snared by the silken cords of favor,
bound by the willow’s tender grasp.
Burden piled mountain-high,
depths like the sea,
the whole body weighed down.
Turn the head to look—
only a mound of idle earth won.

This fleeting span of time,
white-haired, self-invited sorrow.
Withdraw early,
quickly seek the way out.
To the land of water and clouds,
idly roam and laugh,
walk with open heart.
A dark pearl awaits—
upon return, entrust it to them.

**Brahmin’s Prelude**
Not a single thread stands,
all conditions cast away—
the true meaning revealed.
Lightly tread the scene,
serene and clear.
Seek not beyond this realm,
nor in other worlds,
the cave-heaven apart.
Like Han Lu chasing clods,
or mistaking mirage for spring—
the primal source endures.
This alone—
nothing more profound.
Silently investigate,
precise and true,
essence and function complete.
Bright and boundless,
a radiance unmarked by years.
When you grasp it,
the moon of the heart rounds full.

**Its Second**
From ancient times to now,
the clamor never ceases—
all rush to the arena
of profit and fame.

Boats and carriages, servants and steeds—mad as frenzy.
In the end, merit and enterprise,
entrusted to the yellow millet dream.
Why stubbornly chase the lost deer,
blind to the straying sheep?
Best guard yourself well.
Step firmly toward
the land of water and clouds.
Sever the old paths of coming and going,
each step pure and clear.
Naturally self-attained,
this is the eternal chamber of luminous pearl and jade.
Truly so—
who would dare claim it?

**Its Third**
Beyond the world, within cave-heavens,
a realm of natural truth, wondrous and hard to convey.
Palms hold true feasts, lingering in delight.
Cranes dance, dragons chant, phoenixes cry,
mists fly, clouds drift.
Rainbow banners and moon-tipped staves,
feathered canopies and mushroom cakes.
Drunkenly discourse on the profound,
spitting pearls and jade,
murmuring like flowing springs.
Laughing, point to Penglai’s shallows—
how many times has it turned to mulberry fields?
The true visage endures through ages,
even if kalpa-fire burns all to ash, it remains unchanged.
Who understands this—
the immortals of the Purple Court?

**Its Fourth**
This body is finite,
yet fame and gain are endless, bitterly sought.
People ask: for what towering deeds?
In the end, a hundred years of light
win only a desolate mound.
Like morning dew on flower tips,
or foam upon the water’s face.
Wake in time—let go.
See through this bodily prison.
Cut the thousand-year snare of delusion,
leap from the torrent’s flood.
Carefree and unbound,
refine a single grain of divine elixir,
roam beyond the world.
When merit and practice are full,
step lightly onto Penglai’s isles.

**Attendant Incense-Bearing Youth**
Between heaven and earth,
vast and unbounded.
A simple robe suffices for a few kindred spirits.
Where to find a place for the heart to dwell?
Among ten thousand valleys of pine winds,
a single stream of cold jade.
A thatched hall gleams,
a plain stove warms the incense burner—fragrance rich.

Hear the refined strains,
cloud-borne melodies beyond the dust.
Peaks arrayed at the window part
to reveal the moon’s true face.
Though Penglai’s isles remain unseen,
this life is already full.

So the tale goes—Jade Maidens,
shy-faced, meet by chance,
a single glance recognizing kindred souls.
In the heart’s deep communion,
distant mountains shrink to a thumb’s green.
Cave-heaven’s cloud-shadows,
jumbled verdant crags coiled with rock.
Lingzhi herbs flourish still,
having weathered autumn’s hues.
The shallow Penglai,
laughing, asks:
is the vast sea so easily crossed?
Hand in hand, gather the true,
roam as one through heaven and earth.
People exhaust their thoughts,
like lightning turned, wind-tossed dust motes.
At the jade peaks’ grand gathering,
no word is sent.
Gaze at the plum blossoms—
a wide-sleeved robe, simply cut.
Open or close at will,
no need for clasps or ties.
An untrammled heart,
flowing sleeves, arms free to stretch or bend.
Nothing more.
Worn as a cloak while walking,
doubly suited for folding hands in company.
As if weary, the body fully surrenders,
yet what harm in glancing before or behind?
Elegantly paired with straw sandals,
perfect with a staff of fine wood,
welcoming and sending off cloud companions.
Should one ask its weight,
shake it out before them—clear and bright.

---

**Second Stanza: The Padded Jacket**
No need for finery in dress.
Follow nature’s hues—
cloth and silk, thread by thread.
Choose neither green nor yellow,
let warp and weft fall as they may,
stitching patches where needed.
See the craft:
a hundred pieces, a thousand strips,
tightly sewn, firmly worn.
Adapting to cold and heat,
wherever you go, no doubt lingers.
Arms swing, the body rolls,
all as you please, no need for care.
No one watches.
Freely at ease, boldly take charge,
master of your own domain.

---

**Mountain Brook Tune**
A lifetime of idleness,
knowing no idle vexations.
A snail-shell hut holds the body,
who cares for jade towers or isles of gold?
Though neighbors may dwell nearby—
two or three rustic homes—
I forget taking and leaving,
cut off greeting and farewell,
never stepping beyond the gate.
The malady of mist and clouds,
no wondrous medicine can cure.
Just let the heart rest at ease,
unwilling to disturb the spirit’s source with clamor.
In dwelling, walking, sitting—
beyond these, no other skill.
Truly, this is the matter,
joyful and carefree,
the very path ahead.

---

**Second Stanza**
A blink, a glance,
expounding the profoundest mystery.
The yellow leaf silences the child’s cry—
no need to wait for sharp contention.
The Jade Pass soldier grows old,
go home, cease talk of war.
Leisurely days, peaceful years,
village brew flows in every home.
A staff slung across the shoulder,
singing a carefree tune.
Why envy courtly glory?
What care for trailing one’s tail in the mud?
The golden carp swims free,
leaping high through Yu’s Gate.
Cast aside the nets,
unfurl the lines,
no need for hook or bait.

---

**Third Stanza**
From old, ingrained habits,
how much worldly clutter?
Once awakened, swiftly dissolve them,
in motion or stillness, focus the mind.
Idle rights and idle wrongs,
not a thread of attachment.
Seal the mouth, tightly rein the heart,
first sweep away self and others.
In dwelling, walking, sitting—
do not vex the mind’s king.
Above lies the mechanism,
no longer permitting fools to grasp it at once.
Accumulate merit, pile up practice,
wisdom’s eye suddenly opens.
The magic herb blooms,
the great elixir forms,
becoming an ageless immortal.

---

**Fourth Stanza**
A decade of delay,
nurturing true shamelessness.
Nothing entangles the heart,
utterly severed from worldly passions and ways.
Greeting and parting grow light,
days spent in leisure.
Socks turned inside out,
clothes donned haphazardly,
letting others love or hate as they will.
Forged, the three-foot blade—
the Dragon Spring’s swift edge.
Its radiance pierces the heavens,
yet no whole ox is seen to dissect.
Hesitant, glancing all around,
daring not treat it lightly.
Carried close, sealed tight,
enduring as earth and sky.

---

**Magpie Bridge Immortal**
Doubt’s root not severed,
the wandering soul does not return.
How many idle passions entangle?
Wild clouds, stream waters—
a body free and unbound,
yet still choosing the shackles of profit and fame.
Once the dusty green is judged,
worldly feelings all cast aside,
too late to regret the heart’s late return.
Deep in the five-colored clouds,
drunk on the immortal peach—
no envy for children and grandchildren filling the eyes.

---

**Second Stanza**
Mist-hidden by the mountain,
dancing shadows by the pool.

Yet ensnared by the trappings of culture—
what crime did the *yuzhang* cedar, the nanmu, commit,
to suffer axe and blade, maimed beyond count?
Clear-eyed yet unenlightened,
still clinging to old dusk.
Where lies the hollow fame left behind?
Mistaking fleeting light for truth,
all thought of the long-life path forgotten.

**Third Stanza**
Jade shattered, stone crushed,
pearls torn from broken oysters.
The striped leopard, the sleek fox—
self-ruin their own fate.
Who among the crowd would hide themselves in secret?
Only to primp and preen, vying to sell their wares.
Boast of merit, then retreat;
claim a name, then fall.
The mirror’s crimson bloom never returns.
In the end, all turns to dust—
vainly discarded, the dark pearl’s treasure.

**Fourth Stanza**
The dark pearl admits no kind,
the true visage has no peer.
Not a speck of dust permitted to veil it.
Years deepen, the tempered steel grows ever clearer,
destined for the celestial treasury,
its hoard unmatched.
Whole in body, light and swift,
free of cunning or artifice.
The net of dharma, the dust of passion—both undone.
Should one ascend the jeweled summit, seeking counsel,
this is not permitted—
no trafficking in the mortal realm.

**Fifth Stanza**
Heaven’s true, numinous seed,
a dream of *Huaxu*—
what use to ask of men?
The dark pearl, sealed in the celestial treasury,
vowed never to flaunt in the red dust.
Demonic hosts clamor in unison,
their voices rising and falling—
let them take their pomp and reverence.

**Sixth Stanza**
The golden-furred beast strides onto the stage,
yet forgets its mountain-like immutability.
Wife and sons—iron chains,
home and fields—raging wildfire.
How to endure such frenzied torment?
The fly’s head, the snail’s horn—how much can they yield?
Yet life is cast aside,
vying for self, contending for others.
Bound in delusion, never transcending,
willingly trapped in the cage.
The black riddle—none can unravel.
Soon Yama’s warrant will come to summon,
leaving no time for children and grandchildren to grow.

**Seventh Stanza**
The crooked hook stirs the waters,
the straight hook catches nothing—
ancient and modern know this truth.
Worldly affairs: the false is seen as real,
yet none recognize the primordial treasure.
Solitary radiance shines in perfect clarity,
forgotten in shared resonance.
All things cease to oppose or foretell.
From the original point, a path opens to heaven—
on Guye Mountain, one laughs in freedom.

**Eighth Stanza**
A mass of cunning,
a mass of temper—
every move deceives heaven, obscures earth.
Harming others for self, destroying lives,
amassing karma—who will bear it in their stead?
The underworld’s judgment is inescapable,
no plea or excuse permitted.
Better to change one’s ways now,
than to suffer torment—when will it end?

**Ninth Stanza**
The spring-fed source of the spirit,
orchid gardens, herb fields—
awakening my longing to return, dancing in the wind.
Jade halls and golden chambers hidden in clouds,
only then does one believe the path to the heavens exists.
Jasper terraces, jade isles,
pearl groves, gemstone trees—
fragrant mists and divine winds guide each step.
How many times has one gazed at the peach blossoms by the sea?
Once in a thousand years, the flowers bloom anew.

**Tenth Stanza**
The clapper’s lies are heard,
heaven’s truth becomes falsehood.

Those who delight in posturing with cunning schemes,
brandish the roar of "fierce fire" and "walking the void"—
yet all their tricks are mere flourishes
on the blockhead’s stage.
Little gain, much pretense,
displaying every artifice of a lifetime.
In the end, what meaning remains?
The Mystic Pearl and Vast Image—both lost.

**Eleventh Stanza**
*For the Great Abbot of the Sandalwood City*

Coming as if awake, departing as if in dream,
parting without a trace of sentiment.
Few words at the farewell,
only this caution: "Do not toy with human kindness."
A true master is to be revered,
chosen among the immortal realms.
Ride the iridescent simurgh, the golden phoenix,
to the Peach Banquet of Penglai’s high assembly—
far nobler than the clamor of the mortal world.

*Yunshan Ji, Scroll Five Concludes*

*(Note in Yuan woodblock edition: Below this, a preface reads: "Since my restless wanderings eastward, winding through the hills for over a decade, I have lost all trace of Shanyang. One day, my cousin—undaunted by the brambles—turned his gaze to the lotus pavilion, inquiring after our uncle’s well-being and the safety of the jade kin. Still disoriented, as if in a dream, I hastily composed this *Yuzhonghua* lyric to send to him.")*

*(Yuan carved edition titles this: "For the Great Abbot, While in Gongcheng.")*

*Yunshan Ji, Scroll Six—Lyrics*
*By Perfected Master of Constancy, Ji Zhizhen*

**Tai Chang Yin**

**I**
Deep night, congealed in stillness—moonlit hall.
Trailing threads of soul-returning incense,
things and self both forgotten.
Suddenly, I am in the Celestial Realm of Pure Subtlety.
Past and present before my eyes,
the world’s valleys and ravines—
all alike lose the sheep.
At peril’s edge, no guard is kept,
yet all rush to the battleground of locust and sandalwood.

**II**
Mountain brimming with wind and scene—a creek’s cloud.
Gibbons and cranes make their own neighbors,
far from the dust’s soft red.
Beyond things, I arrange this body.
Crucible and elixir tripod,
phoenix-fat and dragon-scales,
boil the jade blossoms anew.
Feasting and wandering in scenes of eternal spring,
I must take up the mantle of Penglai’s old ones.

**III**
Illusory dust swirls—dream-souls take flight.
Step lightly, tread on danger’s snare.
Awakened, I startle at myself,
leaping free from the cage’s confines.
Straw sandals and patterned staff,
plain cap and disheveled locks,
bamboo hat and palm-bark cloak.
Clouds and waters go east or west—
why care for the world’s right or wrong?

**IV**
Wise and foolish alike scurry, vying in schemes.
Only profit and fame matter,
like tide-riders in a thousand-foot
storm-wave contest.
A hundred years of light,
a mound of dust,
a life of toil and drudgery.
Turning to ask of the road ahead,
I gaze afar—mountains and rivers remain unlevelled.

**V**
Red dust, white hair—still bound and chafing.
Hurried and harried, chasing many forks,
walking corpses with clattering bones.
Ask who drives this coming and going?
A sky of wind and moon,
a creek of clouds and waters—
here is a fine place to dwell.
Telling this only deepens doubt,
like covering ears to steal a bell—self-deceit.

**VI**
Life’s frail bier strays from the true path.
Coming and going, just like madness,
molding mud balls in mud.
Yet never recognizing the luminous night-pearl.
How many storms,
how many grinding years—
who would pause in dread?
Where is home?
Point it out—
how can the doubting heart forget?

**VII**
Nature’s craft fashions a sack of right and wrong,
a marketplace of profit and fame.
Fools haggle endlessly,
losing even their homeland and native village.
Crushed by ice and snow,
vexed by wind and rain,
how many shifts from heat to cold?
A single thought is hard to forget—
enduring kalpas of samsara is only right.

**VIII**
Neither monk nor layman, not seeking immortality.
A thatched hut of two or three rafters,
white stones and clear springs.
Who else asks of Peach Blossom’s grotto-heaven?
One censer of incense,
one bowl of spring snow,
irrigating the three fields in contest.
Idle thoughts on the *Valley Spirit* chapter—
suddenly, I realize the pine-tip moon is full.

**IX**
The Daoist’s livelihood must be pure emptiness,
unbound by profit or fame.
Not a single coin in his moth-eaten purse—
like a lotus rising from water, pearls in its wake.
A gourd for sustenance,
a patched robe for modesty,
what else could he desire?
Pillowed high, he drifts into Huaxu’s dream,
beyond the world, reeling in heaven’s grandeur.

**X**
Knowing well all things turn to emptiness in the end,
he sheds his cage like a feather.
Eating and drinking at ease,
no longer inquiring of Three Mountains or Five Peaks.
A single elixir pill,
a flowering staff in hand,
he roams east and west as he pleases.
Wherever he goes, cloud companions abound,
all lost and found within the Mystery upon Mystery’s Way.

---

**Partridge Sky**

After clouds disperse and wind stills, rain-cleared skies,
new lotuses lift dew—shattered pearls round.
A limpid spring gurgles beyond the dust,
white rocks stand stark, propping drunken slumber.

Mountain hues enfold,
waterside murmurs linger.
Lingering in wind and moonlight, we speak of the Mystery upon Mystery.
The brook boy asks of worldly affairs—
laughing, I point to willows scattering catkins across the boundless sky.

**II**
Painting cakes to sate hunger is but delusion,
carving a boat to seek a sword is surely futile.
Foolish hearts pore over others’ lost covenants,
mad thoughts chase hares or guard stumps anew.

The sages are near,
the ancients’ books remain.
Chaff cannot be made into luminous pearls.
Only when all green is swept away does one grasp the Way—
how could such subtlety be spoken to them?

**III**

**IV**
Emeralds woven, crimson cut—an old garden overflows,
endless flowers and trees contend in dazzling display.
The binding wind will not permit this to endure;
abandoning the old, it seizes the new with cunning sway.

Blossoms litter the earth,
willow fluff scatters the sky.
Tender green fruits swell, leaves veiled in mist.
Unfeeling, it defies the workings of the world’s schemes—
sitting, we watch the branches shift through countless changes.

**V**
Dusk falls, dawn blooms—trees but briefly flourish,
round lotuses rise from water, dew-pearls spill.
Fiery clouds stretch a thousand fathoms, scorching the heavens,
sweat-rain pours in weary, stifling steam.

In the Chamber of Empty Whiteness,
reciting the *Huangting*.
A breeze stirs, bearing lingering coolness.
Sitting, we watch Creation idly at play—
the fevered troubles of floating life never cease.

**VI**
Golden chrysanthemums by sparse fences flaunt Nature’s craft,
grass insects chirp softly, murmuring autumn’s visage.
Lotus withers, duckweed ages, reed flowers whiten,
the west wind stirs, scattering crimson leaves in disarray.

Mountains grow gaunt,
waters vie for dominance.
All ten thousand beings, driven and hurrying, return to the Source.
The Daoist rejoices too in the Three Worms’ demise—
through sleepless nights in the Crimson Palace, he sits.

**VII**
Frost and snow, stark and relentless—all things wither,
unable to endure the long night’s bitter, endless stretch.
Nature’s work hastens the return to primal mandate,
the Year’s Power turns its mechanism to nurture the Great Return.

The earth’s axis coils,
the celestial gate stands firm.
Jade seals, jeweled isles, and the Three Mountains.
True immortals pay no heed to the world’s affairs—
how often have they seen the yellow dust dry the azure sea?

**VIII**
Beyond the gate, yellow dust stains the sojourner,
the mountain lad dares not unbar the cloud-sealed door.
On the stone altar, in pure repose, the spirit roams north—
directly reaching the Void, it joins Jade Capital’s throng.
Fragrant mists swirl,
qi brims full.
Coiled dragons and soaring phoenixes gather in cloud-fellowship.
Pouring emerald wine, he drinks again of the Profound Mystery—
drunk, he rides the wind down from Great Purity.

**IX**
The Maker’s child plays in wild, capricious sport,
marionettes dance on silk strings across the stage.
Deities and ghosts are toyed with, tumbling in use—
walking corpses and running bones scurry day and night.
Not the plum’s domain,
but the realm of fame and gain.
Green flies and white mantises wound one another.
Who marks the toll of chasing sound and form?
Clapping hands, he returns, laughing at the scene.

**X**
A thousand coils of delusive rope—no freedom,
pettily, with toil, he pursues the extraneous.
Yet the heart’s origin holds no vexation—
in the clamor, he first contends to stand foremost.
Adding to my form,
taking on others’ sorrows.
Before merit is complete, his temples frost in autumn.
Twice, the wind of *fangfeng* snaps the drifting silk—
letting go, returning to emptiness, all things cease.

**XI**
In all things, without intent, he attains true leisure,
beyond the dusty gate, affairs no longer concern him.
Crafty nets ensnare through fame’s bonds,
no hook can deceive the mouth that swallows none.
Beyond the world’s cage,
water and clouds idle.
No need to toil at the pivot’s turning.
Lying on white stones amid the sedge, clothed as he is,
wild birds and mountain apes gaze back in shared regard.

**XII**
Weak and adrift, he refuses to return,
the Mystic Pass explained only deepens his confusion.
If on this journey he meets the Old Man of Shangqiu,
he’ll cast aside his skull without hesitation.
First, he errs in haste,
then lags behind.
Who knows the message within?
The east wind fails to carry spring’s tidings—
peach blossoms and plum’s white bloom fill the branches on their own.

**XIII**
With human artifice ever expanding, days grow long,
lightly they squander time, heedless of its cost.
Schemes in endless variety breed boundless sorrow,
a hundred cares wear him down, suffering unbearable.
His heart oppressed,
frost invades his temples.
Across the vast earth, he vainly chases fame.
Words he utters fill the cloth sack with silk,
but all the world sees is gold when they look upon him.

**XIV**
To save himself, he forgets the mad heart and worldly passions,
from mutual reproach he emerges clear as ice.
When men ask of the end, he ceases to count,
walking beyond things, his eyes grow bright on their own.
Mountains hushed,
waters pure and cold.
The sky filled with the bright moon, sparse stars.
The wind in the pines—his true friend—
nightly calls forth the myriad sounds’ song.

**XV**
The households vying for the deer remain lost in dreams,
all before their eyes is but dust and grime.
The traces of ancients—mere words, nothing more,
where now are the merits and fame of past lives?
The moon’s cave,
a heap of scattered prayers.
All their clamorous chatter is best left unheeded.
A single draught of rosy dawn grants three thousand days of drunkenness—
heed not the red wheel’s rise and fall.

**XVI**
Trading bones through myriad lives,
in the crucible’s torment, jagged and grim.
A hundred years pass, yet the wart and wen fade not,
a thousand ages, yet the whale’s maw cannot still.
Then waves surge,
the heart’s war arises.
The deluded rope binds itself, heaping sorrow’s citadel.
How many times has muddied water doused the breast?
Inverted words, topsy-turvy speech—hail the Great Peace.

**XVII**
Light through the crack spurs death’s relentless haste,
this floating life—how many fingers count its span?
The mustard-seed city’s karmic seeds near brimful,
brushing stone, parting clouds—yet the fog will not clear.
Merit lays the foundation,
sin vies for primacy.
Heroes, laid bare, crumble to ash and dust.
A ball of empty illusion idly tossed—
ears like the deaf, no call reaches through.

**XVIII**
Forsaking the world, I thought to dwell in mountains,
yet when men ask, I cannot stay idle.
Friends press close, thrusting me from my place,
the drum’s beat and clapper’s call drive me up the pole.
No leverage,
no turning back.
All mock—where is peace to be found?
Kindness, once applied, twists to malice,
warm breath, once blown, turns to chill.

**XIX**
The Supreme Polarity’s mystery—clear as a mirror,
heaven and earth are but forms within its glass.
Within the body’s shadow, shadows multiply,
in the name of things, names nest anew.
Things beyond emptiness,
judged in dreams.
A ball of empty illusion—play of luminous clarity.
The unwise take life as real,
striving in dreams to grasp the void.

**To the Tune of Linjiangxian**

**I**
The world in tumult chases wealth and rank,
the Daoist alone claims pure poverty.
In pure poverty, soft and weak, he finds repose—
his heart at ease, passing days without affair,
content in fate, delighting in true nature.

A speck of vast integrity, bright as an ancient mirror,
perfectly clear, untouched by the slightest dust.
When merit’s full protection is complete, he communes with spirits,
transcends the triple realms,
and roams through spring’s four seasons.

**II**
Years and months, pitiless, turn swift as lightning,
a human life cannot endure such grinding away.
The road ahead is perilous—do not waste time.
Within a thousand-fathom pit of fire,
leap free to climb the lofty quilt.

Seek instead a place of pure cold, secure and steady,
sweep away the winds and waves of level ground.
Without shifting a single step, arrive at Nothing-What.
A flute without holes,
a song of Great Peace.

**III**
I am by nature a useless thing in this world,
having forgotten every skill and artifice.
For ten years, ice and snow—sitting in an empty hall.
The pull of human feelings stirs,
and I cannot hide my juggling.

Then I recall seeking secluded peaks and cloud-wrapped mountains,
building a thatched hut—what harm in small reclusion?
A bamboo study, a pine-lined path, twice as pure and cold.
Beyond a thousand cicadas, moonlight shines,
and wind stirs the fragrance of a hundred flowers.

**IV**
Brewing the wine of long life in heaven’s vault,
who in this world knows its savor?
A jade flask swiftly filled with azure glass.
Sipping it often, in small draughts,
the spirit’s radiance forgets fatigue.

A fine gathering of friends beyond the dusty world,
sharing fire dates and exchanged pears.
How many times has the azure sea turned to flying dust?
On the day of returning to the Three Mountains,
hand in hand, we step upon the clouds.

**V**
I laugh at the idle tricks upon my tongue—
words, after all, are never true.
Had I known sooner, I would have brushed away the dust from my tongue’s tip.
Three seals keep me ever silent,
transcending the ford of right and wrong.

Banishing a thousand demons and ten thousand trials,
in stillness I suddenly perceive the nourishing of spirit.
Fine winds and bright moons draw near of themselves.
Lifetimes of green habits severed,
I verify the original person.

**VI**

**VI**

The play of self and other, right and wrong—
a puppet show, all hollow clamor
that deafens the ear to emptiness.
Forced divisions of Hu and Han,
painted paths east and west.

See through it: none of this is real.
What differs from a mad wind brushing the face?
Standing before it, one echoes the same.
This is no way to settle the self—
take up the mantle of the true host.

**Ten Thousand Spring Years**

A dream drifts to Huaxu,
palaces mid-heaven beyond mortal dust.
Strange fragrance wafts, ethereal,
trailing clouds and rosy dawn.
Vast and boundless, the spirit’s void—
eternal radiance, bright as noonday.
Who understands?
With you, I know the Dao:
through endless kalpas, spring never ages.

**II**

Arising and ceasing, without feeling,
ancient and modern turn like level water.
Hasten to prepare—
make plans for the journey ahead.
From the primal beginning,
that single point was never apart.
Peerless in spirit,
refine the true form,
and lifespan equals heaven and earth.

**III**

Cloud seas of Penglai,
jade forests and coral trees—true seed of immortals.
Rainbow phoenixes, golden simurghs
come and go in welcome.
Told to the world,
none believe, deeming it futile.
Mortal cares weigh heavy,
countless as ox hairs,
all chasing the dream of the sophora root.

**Fisherman’s Pride**

Cast off the worldly tether, unshackled—
each burden set down, the body light and free.
All mortal ties severed, the world’s ways forgotten,
none gather near.
That original point abides in constant peace.

Everywhere, seek only true freedom.
Who would sell themselves for gain?
No idle spirits, no ghosts or demons,
no obstructions in form.
Why trouble with incense or fruit offerings?

**II**

No tricks, no folly or confusion,
the splendor of the world seen as a dream.

**Won at Last**

Won at last—a lifetime’s heart now hollow,
worldly clutter forgotten.
Guests may come, but none are welcomed or seen off.
My nature aloof, with whom could I share?
Loving idleness, I scorn others’ praise.
Having read the *Nanhua*, I find it of no use—
no more delusions.
In old age, I dread the fuss of idle play.

**Grateful for Imperial Grace**

The fire passed on, kindling the next torch,
petals linked, leaves strung.
Swallowing stubborn spittle, they conjure gods and ghosts.
Upon the stage, they daub mud and smear ash in turn,
wrapped in fame and profit, vainly born and dying.
The *Gudong* and *Man* deceive,
the *Gé-Téng* strikes itself.
Look to the puppet master’s five fingers—
voices fade, strings snap,
all tricks gone, just so.
The puppet’s lofty airs—who moves it now?

**II**

The pearl of Hepu remains unreturned,
dredging the Red Waters in vain.
Eyes brimming with thistles, hearts tangled in tumbleweed—what use?
Even if hands reach down,
eager to rescue the drowning, what of it?
The vast waves surge—who can avoid sinking?
Scheming for honors in the sophora dream,
delighting in the pillow’s gains—
told to the profound and subtle, it all tastes bland.
No need to launch the wooden goose,
the Three Elders return drunk.
Facing the clear waves, no need for clouds or mist as bait.

**III**

Never once strayed from my origin,
though waves shift and forms change.
If I sought words to convey it, where would I find the time?
At peace with my lot, in daily life discerning true from false—
why trouble to seek wonders beyond?
Eight-sided and flawless, no altar needs polishing.
Through the ages, debates never cease.
Leaning on the staff of wú-tóng,
all is left to idle talk.
The treasure pearl’s boundless store—who could pay its price?

**IV**

Nothing pursued, drifting with the current.
To seek immortality is but grand delusion.
In the depths of auspicious clouds,
every barrier crumbles at a touch.
Who understands the true, the real?
Before riding the wind,
self and things forgotten—
compared to the mortal world, how much lighter?
Plucking the stringless lute,
better to wander or sit at ease.
Yet I fear a kindred spirit may hear,
the wind in the pines harmonizing.

**V**

Cloud-plum meets Penglai’s shores,
the roc’s path vast and boundless.
Only by shedding the mortal husk can one step into the realm of immortals.
Yet what of the immortals’ affairs?
The Purple Court and Cinnabar Terrace lie deep and distant.
Even if clearly pointed out,
few would comprehend.
Fields of elixir herbs, gardens of magic mushrooms,
fragrant winds sweeping the ground—who will tend them?
Caverns where night never falls,
under the moon, wandering and chanting in the mist.
Awaiting a true listener, I entrust the treasure of the profound.

**VI**

Purity and truth are our original nature,
stained by the dust of red passion.
The world’s net of emotions and flattery—all vie to chase it.
The vast bitter sea,
stirred by surging, glittering waves.
Those who play in the tide do not shun its dangers.
The far shore is high; the homeland awaits inspection.
Through the ages, wandering souls summon themselves to the terrace.
Every trace wiped away,
the original point remains, undisturbed.
The radiance of night shines in the grotto,
clouds and mist withdraw.

**VII**

A single thought strays from the constant,
plunging into the bitter sea.
The six paths of rebirth, driven by love and desire.
Imprisoned in the shell of things,
when will this inversion be undone?
Among men, greed and error run rampant.
Dying and being born again,
a thousand forms, ten thousand shapes,
endlessly turning—how can one endure?
A fleeting moment,
unseen, the very skin changes.
I urge you: withdraw now, lest you regret it too late.

**VIII**

The sparrow hops, the village cripple walks,
pushing open the gate, setting down the staff.
*Nie Que* and *Zhi Li* stand apart, unleaning.
Slaughtering oxen, herding horses,
they trace the gourd’s outline.
On the journey, even sages grow bewildered.
Unknowing, unperceiving—
how can one find the way?
Wild words spoken, then forgotten.
A hundred guises presented,
all actions and deeds are but illusion.
To truly bear witness—
that is the face of heaven’s truth.

**IX**

Beyond things, far from dust,
the gourd’s heaven, the secluded garden.
Cloud shadows drift beneath the eaves, unfurling and rolling.
The moon’s spirit coldly soaks,
jade flowers bloom unfading.
Exotic fragrance, golden *dunou*—
leading to distant depths.
A grand gathering of banished immortals,
peaches of immortality set at the feast.
Flowing rosy clouds fill the cups, songs urge the drinkers on.
Pearls spray, jade is coughed forth,
phoenixes dance, dragons coil in offering.
Pointing to Penglai and Yingzhou, laughing and carefree,
conversing in the clear and shallow.

**X**

Heaven and earth—a single thatched hut,
the body a traveler’s lodging.
In the snap of a finger, time has flown so swiftly.
Before the eyes, in the heart—
countless illusory flowers, empty ghosts.
All the toil of life, crowded together,
sharing the same prison.
Break through the dust’s bounds,
become master within.
Looking up and down, the world’s past and present—
how can one bear to let that single point
willingly become a prisoner of fame, a captive of wealth?
Seek the groves and springs, at ease,
clouds and mist as companions.

**XI**

Every matter thoroughly known,
then one seeks simplicity.
All actions and deeds are but empty illusion.
The sack of rice, the bag of breath—
tricks performed, shame reddens the face.
After the dream-soul awakens,
the blue eye opens.
Nothing troubles the mind,
idle and carefree.
The net of dharma, the dust’s snares—do not pull or drag.
Mist on the peaks, wild hues,
the moon over the stream, the wind in the pines—endless.
Let the body roam free,
a man unbound.

**XII**

Treading the soft red dust,
the heart’s lord grows vexed.
How much time is seized in the grasp?
Fortune and failure, gain and loss, life and death—all churning,
schemes and insights ever displayed—when will they end?
How much better to come and go,
in the quiet of mountain nooks.
A single step to Penglai—how many reach it?
Wind through forests, moonlight on mantises,
windows framing mist and clouds, drifting.
Let all directions be but the endless
roads of Chang’an.

*Xiao Yao’er: Ode to the Chrysanthemum*

Spring and summer vie in fragrance,
heaven pities this, guarding its hidden light.
Only when all splendor fades does it unfold—
sparse clusters, pale and faint,
a lone, crystalline bearing,
proudly defying autumn’s frost.
How fine its home in the realm of water and clouds.
None may know it—what does it care?
A rare delight, meeting like Yuanming’s,
new pines as companions,
golden blooms unchanged,
wind stirring their celestial scent.

**II**

Autumn’s hues fill the woods with crimson.
Frost’s wind scours—all things grow empty.
Glory and decay shift in an instant, like a hand turned over.
Splendor seen through,
doubts’ roots severed,
leaping free from the cage.
Everywhere, ease is found.
Light of body, swift of spirit,
possessing all divine powers.
In the world of men or the heavens above—no burdens remain.
Riding wind, commanding qi,
soaring unbound,
east, west, south, north.

**III**

The world is too foolish,
lost in illusion’s snares,
binding itself in fetters.
Wife and children, attachments—when will they end?
Birds roosting on the same branch,
at dawn scattering,
each to its own east or west.
Walking corpses, moving husks—
blind to the puppets’ strings.
One day, sudden awakening, eyes open at last.
The rope of delusion cut,
the cage leapt from—
what a bargain indeed.

**IV**

Warm sands, playful gulls at ease.
Follow them—
call ox or horse as you will.
A coffin’s bulk, utterly useless,
parrots squawking at dusk,
corpses steering fate’s chariot,
a hollow boat on river and sea.
No attachments, no desires.
Wherever taken, like duckweed on waves.
All things align with my ear—
wind clear, moon bright,
slender plum, sparse bamboo,
all are heaven’s wandering.

**V**

A single darkness spans the boundless void.

Within the primal chaos, who dares call gnat or roc superior?
A thousand forms, ten thousand shapes—all shift with empty transformation.
Heaven and earth revolve,
wild horses of dust, motes in the sunbeam,
all drift upon the whirlwind’s updraft.
Dragging sandals, clutching gourd and bowl,
no different from jade feasts or golden-bridled steeds.
Though clover-scented phoenix and owl dwell in separate vessels,
a single touch of heaven’s harmony,
a spark of numinous clarity unobscured—
each follows its own carefree path.

**To the Tune of "Spring in Wuling"**

Creation shapes an empty realm,
where self and other, right and wrong entangle.
Ants clash in strife, each bent on gain—
all within the dreamer’s soul.
I urge you: drink this cup of wine beyond the world,
let both cheeks flush crimson.
Drunken eyes gaze dimly at the azure sky—
no need to tell east from west.

**II**

The mountain crow’s call weighs heavy with the urge to return,
where fine retreats lie in woods and springs.
A thatched hut built with two or three beams,
content with one’s lot, not grasping for coin.
Ten thousand valleys roar with wind, a thousand peaks gleam with moonlight,
a small grotto holds its own heaven.
On stone and pine, one sits or sleeps—
where to seek the immortals now?

**III**

Worn straw sandals, a fan discarded after autumn,
not some outmoded relic.
A sideways path, an incense burner, a bottomless pot—
what more could make one stand out?
These things belong only in moments of leisure,
meeting without attachment.
Do not wonder at their chill, clear as ice—
they bring steadiness through a lifetime.

**IV**

Fortunate to meet a true immortal by the sea,
who leaves behind the elixir of long life.
An ancient, secret formula, treasured and preserved,
passed to the company of immortals.
Stored in a golden flask, fermenting,
a single sip brings a thousand autumns of drunkenness.
Though seas turn to mulberry fields, one never lifts their head,
gazing with cool eyes at clams and serpents.

**Willow Tips Green**

In the quiet hour when moon shines bright,
slowly steeping tea as the stove’s fire dies.
The heart’s chamber grows cold as ash,
ancient paulownia strings snap,
embers bloom into congealed flowers.
Waking from a dream of Huaxu,
beyond the mundane,
ice gleams, jade pure.
Auspicious mist swirls,
cinnabar clouds drift,
the palaces of Fivefold Radiance appear.

**II**

Mastery of the threefold truth at the tip of the tongue,
brushing near, one abides in wordless silence.

**Clumsiness**

The ancient Dao flows hidden,
sages of old met in profound accord,
in the era of Great Peace.
On Chang’an’s streets, all directions lie open—
no need to pluck flowers or gather leaves.
Everywhere, perfect communion;
in every moment, all is thus—
the heart-moon, released, shines free.

**III**

Spirit-luminance knows no wax nor wane,
before the Great Simplicity,
eternal through kalpas vast.
Once form is received,
one drifts with the current, forgets the return—
birth and death grind to extinction.
A hundred cravings bring calamity,
piles of bones like mountains never cease.
Yet when the true eye opens,
nothing fundamentally exists—
instantly, one transcends.

**Roam Freely**

Chasing fame, chasing gain,
striving against others, contending with self.
Once the eye opens—
what a farcical spectacle!
Who is high? Who is low?
Who strong? Who weak?
Old Yan’s snare holds all alike.
All affairs cease,
every bond shattered.
Unfettered—
whether dwelling, walking, sitting, or lying.
Before the wind, beneath the moon,
by waterside, beside the crag.
Let me simply
be merry as I please.

**II**

Wearing rustic robes and yellow cap,
straw sandals, cassia staff—
no ties, no chains,
roaming clouds and waters at will.
Singing as I walk, dancing as I stand,
discoursing on mysteries, chanting pure verses.
No thought for the loftiness of kings or lords.
The moon of nature, full and bright,
the spirit-pearl, radiant and clear.
Throughout the ten directions,
no obstructions, no barriers.
At ease, carefree,
reclining or rising—
if others ask of affairs,
let them toil and bustle.

**III**

**IV**

Yesterday an infant,
today grown old—
a hundred years but
a flash of lightning, a spark from flint.
Sinews bound to flesh,
skin and hair enwrapping:
drunkard’s delusion,
mistaking this for me.
Vying for qi, forgetting form,
coveting wealth, courting disaster—
in the end,
what will it amount to?
Turn back, recognize
your original true self.
This tangle of doubt—
shatter it at once.

**Phoenix Perched in Wutong**
The Maker toys with men, yet none understand.
In the theater of sound and color,
puppets dance idly on.
Through the ages, rise and fall—
a grand deception;
the play ends in an instant, all rendered useless.
Blinded eyes see only muddled cages.
Walking corpses, moving skeletons,
chasing power, exchanging courtesies.
Strength and weakness, right and wrong—
empty clamor,
vain lives, futile deaths, outdone by the wheel of rebirth.

**II**
Time, swift as a galloping steed, mocks us.
Fleeting existence—
phantoms conjured, vanishing in a step’s turn.
Drunk and oblivious, squandering days in vain,
love’s willows and passion’s shackles weigh like mountains.
A cone’s prick goes unfelt,
but a needle’s sting brings pain.
Life and fate hang by a thread,
while external affairs breed endless dread.
When will the wheel of eyes open wide,
awake at last, no longer lost in the dream of the locust’s root?

---

**Plum Blossoms Clipped**
In the realm of clouds and waters, here is home.
My nature delights in hills and vales,
my will scorns the mists and rosy clouds.
The pure and void have triumphed over worldly splendor.
Let the affairs of the world churn on,
tangled as hemp.
Should a guest arrive, why trouble to brew tea?
In friendship, forgetfulness;
a life of quiet simplicity.
Nothing in my seat to boast of to others—
only the elixir of longevity,
a single grain of cinnabar.

**II**
Pearl trees and jade groves—
a splendid scene.
The jade dragon, weary,
slumbers in silver radiance.
The Azure Lad stirs the stored blossoms of jade,
crystal-clear as an ice-pure flask,
flawless in hue.
The sacred tripod begins to melt, fire gently applied.
Thickly brewed, the phoenix’s cluster,
the finest yellow sprouts.
Golden-hued lamb’s wine—
the world’s pride.
Yet who knows this state,
the immortal’s realm beyond the mundane?

**III**
At dusk, lingering crimson clouds streak the horizon.
Turning inward, free of vulgarity,
I point and instruct the mountain boy.
Fresh spring and lively flame brew the cloud-dragon.

**IV**
In the immortal’s realm, one enjoys the Way—
cool breezes beneath both arms.
The dust of ages, like snow on mountains’ breast,
is swept away. Dark demons dare not show their forms.
Hand in hand with Jade River, we enter the crystal palace.
Beneath the moon, we sing as we wander,
adrift on mist-wrapped peaks.

**V**
The sun blazes, steam rises in sweltering heat.
Dry meditation stirs again—
stillness prevails, yet nothing is achieved.
Late-winter’s snow-waves encroach on frozen depths.
I summon the Dark Lord of Winter,
and cold fills the chamber.
The Northern Emperor’s majesty enforces his decree.
Zhurong retreats; cruel heat vanishes without a trace.
With divine power, I strike through the heart’s core.
Riding this pure breeze,
I return to Penglai’s isles.

**VI**
Right and wrong spill from every tongue,
topsy-turvy, a hundred kinds of folly.
Where can immortals and mortals find their place?
All things are rootless—
empty going, empty coming.
Yet within, a single spark of numinous clarity—
how vast! Across the boundless ages,
all is complete in this emptiness.
Wu Xian, cease your vain conjectures.
Demons cannot glimpse it—
the jeweled mirror stands supreme.

---

**West River Moon**

I.
Chasing lost sheep with a staff—why ask?
Unfurling plantain leaves, losing the deer—why pursue?
All dwell within the dream’s haze,
dream within dream, layer upon layer.

Perfect in primal harmony, integrity, and profit,
round and bright, subtle and wondrously penetrating.
A blink of the eye, a glance—no need for description.
Lift it forth, and every marvel unfolds.

II.
Clapping, I seal the empty vastness—
it encompasses heaven and earth, yet remains unfathomable.
The three thousand worlds are all contained within,
not some vague, all-encompassing blur.
Mad Kuang forgets his words mid-speech;
Ji Xian hangs his head in shame.
Try to grasp what was never separate from our school—
it shatters the noon dream of the southern branch.

III.
Within the sun and moon of self-nature,
a boat sails the sea of original truth.
A thousand gates, ten thousand doors—
all are opened to guide others onto the path of the lost sheep.
Passing the flame, handing on the torch—yet none understand.
First, taste the golden pot’s jade wine.
Before the censer of Mount Bo, incense from before the kalpas burns—
the nose’s perception cannot fathom such wonder.

IV.
Formless, yet wielding marvels in every direction,
beyond shape, left and right are all my own.
Heaven and earth are wholly thus,
like evening shadows merging with the formless.
From the tranquil universe, celestial light arises within;
the empty chamber is the true master’s abode.
Wherever effort is applied,
the divine boat sails steadily homeward.

V.
Not in the fist or the pointing finger,
nor in the corners of eyes or brows.
Originally, a single point—let it rest in serenity.
Adorn it with the slightest thread, and it is defiled.
No need for rush mats or bamboo chairs,
no clinging to scriptures or ivory slips.
When this heart abides in profound stillness,
every subtle and vast marvel proves its truth.

VI.
Vast and minute, everywhere present—
flying, swimming, moving, growing, teeming.
Heaven and earth rise and fall without ceasing.
Who, then, turns the wheel?
The wondrous principle circulates alone;
the true sovereign dwells beyond all knowing.
A single needle, a blade of grass—all are one.
Lift it forth, and even empty space gleams.

VII.
Vast, it fills heaven and earth;
profound, it pierces stone and metal.
A thousand forms, ten thousand shapes drift within—
from ancient times to now, all lament in vain.
Clods of earth tossed in the void—none see them;
lost pearls, formless images—who can find them?
The song of non-birth finds few who understand.
When sung, it silences the mouths of all schools.

VIII.
Awakened nature has always been complete;
heavenly truth is inherently whole.
Yet floating life is often deceived by the eyes,
bewildered by moonlit illusions and phantom flowers.
From what do the eight consciousnesses arise?
Whose are the six senses?
Suddenly, shatter this knot of doubt—
my Way is clearly and consistently one.

IX.
Ask not of cinnabar or lead tripods,
nor of tigers coiled with dragons.
Within, the wondrous point reveals itself—
karmic consciousness, frantic, cannot fathom it.
The six desires and seven emotions turn to ash;
the five agents and four images scatter like clouds.
Release and gather—all is a single joy.
The divine pearl of the Red Waters shines resplendent.

X.
Things perish within limits;
human life’s splendor is brief.
The two luminaries hasten to wear it away—
why exhaust oneself in strife, competing with others?
See clearly as a tortoise-shell mirror;
let others debate like rivers in flood.
In the end, no scheme can evade Yama.
What dodge or excuse will suffice?

---

**Clouds Over Mount Wu**

I.
The mountain cradles the moon in stillness,
empty-hearted clouds emerge from the peaks.
Unobstructed, unhindered, they adorn the celestial wheel,
coming and going, freely communing with the divine.
Who presides over the void?
Seated upright, releasing and gathering.
Light and shadow pervade heaven and earth—
the true master abides in silent presence.

II.
Dharma rain graces the sacred mountain;
auspicious winds carry the fragrance of divine herbs.
In every grotto-heaven, purity reigns,
and the sun and moon’s radiance stretches far.
Jade pendants and golden bells sway;
in flight, we sport through the great void.
Deep amid the five-colored clouds, we drink jade nectar,
drunk in the land of Great Peace.

III.
Warmth stirs the ashes of the calendar;
yang harmony enters the burning scars.
Spring’s colors, secretly transmitted, fill heaven and earth—
withered and decayed, they vie to renew.
Marvelous workings, selfless and formless,
carve ten thousand deeds and a thousand forms.
Without a word, the myriad things flourish of themselves—
why ask the Lord of the East?

IV.
Lush trees, branch upon branch, flourish;
round lotuses, stem upon stem, exude fragrance.
The Craftsman’s garden holds them in close embrace—
divine beauty fills the pond.
Pebbles flow like molten gold;
grasping a fan, drinking ice—hard to endure the heat.

V.
One forgets both self and world,
at ease wherever the cold lingers.

VI.
Golden winds disperse the clouds;
the jade heavens unfold anew.
A lone moon, towering, turns its icy wheel—
its radiance shatters the dusk.
In pure stillness, the melody excels,
ethereal, the true realm of Great Void.
No need for wind-borne chariots or whirling wheels—
with level steps, one crosses Kunlun.

VII.
Nongyu sings the pure melody;
Feiqiong dances, scattering blossoms.
Heaven and earth, one hue, scatter silver mist—
where lies the immortal’s home?
Within and without, not a speck of dust remains;
all manifests the Great Void’s message.
Shimmering, high and low all crystalline—
even spirits and ghosts seek in vain.

*Sumuzhe*
Little do I chase companionship,
seldom do I attend gatherings.
Content to follow fate’s green thread,
I let others love or despise.
I’ve seen through life and death, the great journey ahead.
I trace back to the primal origin,
day and night never obscured.
No grain do I hoard, no strange feats do I feign.
My body and mind stand firm,
every move unobstructed.
I’ve won boundless freedom and ease.
When deeds are complete and merit full,
surely I transcend the Three Realms.

*End of Yunshan Ji, Scroll Six*
*Yunshan Ji, Scroll Seven: Stele Records*

**Stele Record of Patriarch Chongyang’s Inauguration of the Dao**
*Composed by Zhi Chang the Perfected, Ji Zhizhen*

In origin, the Supreme Dao emerged from primordial heaven. The Most High established its foundation, and successive sages inherited and expanded its legacy. The numinous source and wondrous root, once revealed, remain unobscured; the hidden pass and mysterious gate stand wide, never sealed. From this, teachings were established, and each generation produced those who upheld them.

Yet as the world waxed and waned, and the times shifted, the age grew distant from the sages, and the radiance of the spirit no longer shone. Waves surged, divergent schools vied for dominance, branches and leaves proliferated, and frivolous embellishments flourished. The great simplicity of the nameless was scattered, the elusive pearl of the formless was lost. Forgetting the root and straying from the source, people chased after sounds and colors. The true path became obstructed, and the Dao grew desolate and barren.

Thus, the sage arose anew, delving into the primal origin of the one qi of heaven. The great work was renewed, aligning with the convergence of the myriad spirits. Heaven endowed and divinely bestowed, striving to restore the crumbling order. The patriarch established the lineage, renewing the bonds of transmission. Casting aside the superficial and gathering the essential, he rescued the drowning and guided the lost, reforming corruption and revitalizing the Dao, until the mysterious gate was reopened. This was none other than Patriarch Chongyang.

His surname was Wang, personal name Jia, courtesy name Zhiming, and Daoist name Chongyangzi. A native of Xianyang in Jingzhao, he possessed a stalwart frame and an untrammeled spirit, his profound insight spanning the vast and boundless. In secret communion, he aligned with the abstruse, his wisdom penetrating the true source, his conduct transcending the sea of dharmas. His vast capacity took emptiness and nonbeing as its essence, the corporeal form unworthy of concern. His mysterious workings paired with the transformations of creation, and worldly passions stilled at once. He shattered illusions as easily as crushing withered wood or snapping rotten reeds, and severed doubts like uprooting mushrooms or tearing away couch grass. Steadfast as a great bell hung in the void, resplendent as a precious mirror raised on high.

From his encounter at Gan River, he secretly received the divine elixir; through the communion of poured water, his wisdom treasury was flung open. Thus, his nature’s heaven congealed in stillness, his ocean of awakening vast and boundless. When he sat in silent meditation at noon, the thunderous roar of profound silence suddenly resounded; when the crows flew over Liu and Jiang, the moon of perfect clarity shone without end. He manifested earthly omens, deeply shouldering the celestial mandate. In the "living death" of his tomb, he demonstrated the profound revival after apparent demise; his spirit tablet proclaimed the eternal freedom of the primal origin. Like a rare jade blossom, few recognized his brilliance; like the reopening of stone marrow, few encountered him.

Thereupon, he sought disciples to carry on the flame of his lineage, foreseeing them on the eastern shores. Burning his hermitage and sweeping away its traces, he set forth with staff in hand, journeying through the clouds. To others, he declared: "I shall capture a horse among Qiu, Liu, and Tan." The world, unaware of his meaning, dismissed him as mad, and none believed him.

In the summer of the seventh year of the Dading era, in the fourth month, he set out eastward, reaching Ninghai and Dengzhou in Laizhou. Raising a banner of iridescent transformation, he cast the bait of clouds and mist. Through expedient means and divine transformations, in less than a few years, he drew forth seven vessels fit to receive the Dao. Among them were indeed Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—dragons within the Dao. He bestowed upon Master Ma the name Danyangzi, Master Tan the name Changzhenzi, Master Liu the name Changshengzi, and Master Qiu the name Changchunzi. Alongside these four were Yuyangzi Master Wang, Guangningzi Master Hao, and the Unfettered Adept Qingjing, all of whom attained sudden enlightenment upon witnessing his presence. He instructed each to cultivate according to their circumstances, refining the self and nurturing the true.

He then led the four masters to Daliang, lodging at the Cizhi Inn of the Wang family in Yuetai Ward. Morning and night, they gathered to refine and polish one another, plumbing the depths of the Dao’s mysteries. One day, he addressed the four: "Each of you must guard your own nature and life. Should doubts arise, consult Danyang. I now go to keep my appointment with the Perfected." The following day, he indeed ascended in a radiance of mist. This occurred on the fourth day of the first month in the gengyin year of the Dading era. He was fifty-eight years of age.

His wondrous transformations and divine manifestations are recorded elsewhere and cannot be fully recounted here. His sacred remains were later interred on Mount Zhongnan. At that time, the great dynasty flourished, venerating the Dao and its virtue. After Perfected Changchun responded to the imperial summons, the mystic wind surged, and the teachings of the Dao thrived day by day. Subsequently, Perfected Qinghe, successor to the lineage, commanded his disciples to develop the burial site into Chongyang Abbey. The place of his ascension was then grandly renovated into Chaoyuan Abbey.

Let us consider: those in the world who claim to have attained the Dao are invariably scrutinized for their deeds; those said to have achieved immortality are invariably judged by their extraordinary feats; those who seek longevity are invariably expected to preserve their form and remain in the world. Yet they fail to grasp that divine transformations and wondrous manifestations, ever-shifting and without constancy, are but the objects of admiration for those who delight in the strange—mere deceptive tricks in the eyes of Daoists.

As for the root and origin, the eternal and unchanging from time immemorial, how could such things be easily seen or known by the vulgar? The Patriarch’s advent served but to transmit this truth. Thus, the shifts of qi’s movement cannot be controlled, the impulses of transformation never truly arise. Roaming freely in the boundless expanse, wandering unfettered in the vast wilderness, hidden or manifest, unpredictable, responding to change without fixed form—subtle as to enter the finest hair, vast as to embrace the cosmos, existing yet not existing, dwelling in emptiness yet not empty—pure and contending with the original state, constant as ancient and modern.

The Patriarch established his foundation upon this principle and engaged the world accordingly. Through the transformation of form to expound the Dao, he directly entered the realm of neither death nor life, merging with the Dao as one. Yet even this is but a superficial glimpse of his edge, not the essence of his nearness. That which is near cannot be fathomed even by the most eloquent. How much less can it be expressed?

With clumsy strokes, I respectfully inscribe this inscription.

The Primordial Virtue is an ocean of longevity, vast and boundless. Its radiance treasures the celestial palace, pure and unchanging. The Patriarch came from the West, transmitting this wondrous essence. With a flourish of numinous emptiness, he stilled the leviathan and mended the broken. Four disciples followed, embracing the One School of Non-Action. With single-minded devotion, they revered the ancient true visage. When the elixir was perfected and the world wearied of, he shed his form like a cicada casting its husk—shedding form, shedding dharma, returning to the boundless. Time could not constrain him, nor place obstruct. Moving between being and non-being, his spiritual powers were free and untrammeled. To honor these numinous traces, a palace was established. Like flame kindling flame, the mysterious wind spread far. The stele of Qiyun Abbey on Mount Zhongnan.

The essence of the Quanzhen School had fermented for years, its flame passed from torch to torch, unbroken through ancient and modern times. Yet those who concealed themselves in profound obscurity, making their teachings difficult to disseminate, guarded their radiance to the edge of extinction, forsaking the world and leaving humanity behind—dwelling in solitude. Their teaching took "ascending through the profound mystery" as its core, "non-action and purity" as its constant, and "resonance with dharma" as its periphery. Gathering the real and discarding the ornamental, returning to simplicity and restoring the uncarved block—this was the heart-seal of the Old Master.

At the dawn of the Huangtong era, Patriarch Chongyang emerged from the dust, preserving his spirit and encountering transformation, at last illuminating the light. He transmitted this Dao to several disciples by the sea—those such as Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu. Though the root was strengthened, the teaching had not yet flourished widely. It was not until the Longxing era of our imperial dynasty, after the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring arose and responded to the summons, that the mysterious wind surged, its transformation harmonizing all directions. Disciples everywhere established abbeys and temples—from ancient times to the present, never had there been such prosperity.

Among his followers was Master Ren, a man of Xiangtai. Forsaking the secular, he embraced the mysterious and journeyed north to Yan and Ji, becoming a disciple of the Perfected One of Qiyun. He followed the Dao for years, receiving its secrets in silence. In the spring of the *yiyou* year, he descended the mountain and soared like a bird, spreading the teaching through Qin and Jin, reaching Mount Zhongnan and the Palace of Longevity of Chongyang. Five *li* away, there was a hamlet called Liangjiazhu, where it was said an ancient Abbey of Grotto Purity stood—established by the divine transformation of Chongyang. The truth of this was unclear. After generations passed, it had fallen into ruin, overgrown on all sides, with only the path of weasels and badgers remaining.

Having secured this site and obtained a grant from the Office of the Capital Prefecture, they were permitted to reclaim and develop it. The abbot, Master Ren, led his disciples—Li Zhicong, Wen Zhiqing, and dozens of others—in concerted effort, laboring together to rebuild the abbey. Spanning over seventy *mu*, the grounds were traversed by paths winding through tall bamboo, encircled by clear streams. Halls and sanctuaries stood complete, corridors aligned in order, the Square Pot Pavilion nestled behind, and secluded chambers hidden in quietude.

Thereupon, the imperial commissioner, the honorable Zhang of the Xila clan, lent his support to the endeavor. The Pure Harmony Perfected One inscribed the plaque, naming it "Abbey of Perching Clouds," designating it a place for extending the sovereign’s longevity and offering prayers and supplications. With heart’s incense frequently kindled, the winds of the Mysterious Ancestor were glorified; with the lamp of nature ever burning, the transformation of the Perfect Realization was revealed.

On the day of its completion, they commanded the carving of jade-green stone to perpetuate its legacy. Thus, an inscription was composed:

*"The wheel of mechanism renews daily, thus perfect and true.
Upheld by profound stillness, preserved in pure simplicity.
The advent of the Patriarch, as if this very teaching were new.
By the shores of the Eastern Sea, passed to a few disciples.
The great revival of the Mysterious Wind, the divine vessel universally revealed.
Amidst the vast kalpas, rarely encountered—how fitting to set one’s resolve!
Those who enter this gate, how could they not reflect?
Rising early and retiring late, strive to emulate this way."*

**Stele of the Abbey of Perching Clouds in Luoyang**

At the dawn of the Sagely Ancestor’s reign, he sought to summon those of the Dao. Following the summons of the Perfected One of Eternal Spring, the transformation spread boundlessly, the Dao’s radiance grew ever brighter, and the Mysterious Wind flourished. The call to don cap and robe drew crowds like mist gathering and clouds converging; the construction of abbeys and temples spread like stars in the sky or pieces on a chessboard. If even distant frontiers were thus, how much more so the Central Plains?

South of this capital, a day’s journey away, stood an ancient hamlet called Zhuge. To its left rose Song and Shaoshi; to its right, the Dragon Gate loomed. Before it stood Mount Wan’an; to its north flowed the Yi and Luo rivers. Here, an abbey named Perching Clouds was established. Tracing its origins, it was the four disciples of the Perfected One of Perching Clouds who initiated and built it.

In the autumn of the *xinsi* year, the Perfected One opened the Dao at Mount Pan, and those who came to cultivate were many, seeking to resolve their doubts. His fame spread far, and those in yellow caps and rustic robes who flocked to his gate were beyond counting—he was then the foremost among those who aided the teaching. Among his disciples were four: first, Cui Zhiyin; second, Guan Zhidao; third, Dong Daoheng; and fourth, Li Zhixi. All had studied under him for years, each receiving his seal of approval. Their hearts were in accord, and they were as friends.

In the ninth month of the *jiawu* autumn, they discussed a journey to gather the Real. Traveling from north to south, they traversed the lands of Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Lu, following the flow or halting as needed, yet not reaching the depths of Tanhuai. At that time, the world had just endured the upheaval of the *renchen* year. The northern gates of Henan’s cities lay in ruins, their inhabitants desolate. From the passes eastward, for over a thousand *li*, all was garrisoned land—wilderness blocked the roads, human traces vanished, and only those bearing arms passed through.

In the fourth month of the *bingshen* summer, the four crossed Meng Ford and journeyed to Luoyang. By dusk, they reached Chen Chang, where they encountered an old friend, Master Shi. Seeing them, he was overjoyed, treating them with great warmth and reluctance to part, hosting them for months. As they surveyed the bright and elegant mountains and rivers, their hearts found resonance, and they settled like drifting duckweed, arriving at Zhuge. Gazing around, they saw a place no different from deep mountains and vast marshes, far removed from the mortal realm—a fitting site for dwelling in the Real and nurturing vastness.

Inquiring of their neighbors, they learned it was the ancestral home of Dong Daoheng. They ascertained the land’s fertility and the boundaries of fields, all overgrown and blocked, with brambles towering to the sky. No master remained, only ruins and scattered tiles. Thereupon, the four resolved to establish an abbey, laying its foundation. Soon after, Wang, Yang, Jiang, and Li arrived, joining their efforts with zeal, vying to contribute. They chose the site, cleared the thatch, and reclaimed the wilderness. Breaking the withered and pulling up the decayed, they cut through thickets of thorns and brambles; sweeping away filth and dispelling disorder, they planted jujube and pear trees. Laboring from dawn to dusk, the land transformed day by day, month by month. Nearly twenty years passed, and the abbey gradually flourished.

They erected the Main Hall to enshrine the Three Clarities, and behind it, the Hall of Perfected Ones to honor the multitude of sages. To the right stood the Cloud Assembly; to the east, the Fragrant Accumulation. Nearby, the abbey walls enclosed six hundred *mu* of fertile fields. They cultivated and protected over a thousand fruit-bearing trees, while cypress and juniper stood dense and solemn, the gates and courtyards serene. Provisions for life’s sustenance were abundant, drawn from the surroundings; in welcoming those who came, they reaped benefits both for themselves and others.

Here the master’s roots were honored, the nation’s blessings cultivated through offerings and rites. Prayers ascended for the celestial chart, supplications rose for the people’s welfare. Clouds and mist settled as the master and perfected ones came and went—thus was he the eastern host of the Dao.

Once construction was complete, the abbey was named *Abiding Clouds*, for it took its name from the master’s Daoist appellation, hoping never to forget him. The three disciples had fulfilled their duties; following their master, they returned to Bian. Only Li Zhixi remained for years without fail, steadfastly completing the work—a worthy guardian. Master Cui later assisted in fashioning the statues.

In the spring of the *zhaoyang* year of the *Dayuanxian* cycle, those in service came from afar to pay their respects, entreating me for an inscription to record these events. Duty forbade refusal, so I reluctantly complied, writing plainly:

**Inscription:**
Great is the Supreme Dao,
without gate, without side.
Neither near nor far,
radiant in all four directions.
The sage attains it,
cherishing it lifelong.
Laozi’s wellspring flows,
transmitted through ten thousand ages.
In recent times, Chongyang,
his dragon, his light.
Changchun follows,
the true wind ever brighter.
*Abiding Clouds’* perfect virtue,
knowing white, guarding black.
Kindness and mercy benefit all,
a model for the world.
Four disciples, wise and steadfast,
carried on the ancestral legacy.
Gathering truth at Guiluo,
Zhu and Ge revived the teachings.
A jade abode arose,
six hundred *mu* of lingzhi fields.
A thousand jujube trees,
ten thousand vistas to behold.
Morning incense, evening lamps,
all good deeds observed.
Heaven’s blessings descend—
what fortune does not arrive?

**Stele of Abiding Clouds Abbey on Mount Pan**

The Dao, formless and boundless,
advances when embodied in people.
Mountains, high or low,
are named for the immortals who dwell there.
This is the hidden harmony of nature’s principles,
the convergence of human affairs.

The mountains northwest of Yuyang were once called *Four Uprights*. In ancient times, there was a Master Tian Pan—*Tian* being his surname. It is unclear from which era he came from Qi, but he dwelled on this mountain for many years, attaining the Dao and becoming a perfected one. Though hunters, woodcutters, and common folk all revered him, his influence spread far and wide, and the mountain came to be called *Mount Pan* in his honor.

At the brow of this mountain, beneath the Purple Peak, lay a secluded and joyful vale, bright and upright, known as *Central Pan*—a misty grotto-palace of clouds and mist. Through countless kalpas, it was home to Buddhist monks. Then came the fall of the Jin dynasty, when the fires of calamity raged, valleys shifted, and the land changed hands. Once more, it became a dense forest, a haven for wolves and tigers.

When the great dynasty rose in splendor, revering the Dao and virtue, Master Changchun of Abiding Clouds answered the imperial summons. In the first month of the *jiashen* year, he returned to Yanran, establishing the Changchun Abbey. From this, the mystic wind flourished, and the four directions responded in harmony. Daoists and laypeople alike looked up in admiration, and disciples gathered like clouds.

Among his followers was Master Abiding Cloud, who delved deeply into the profound mysteries and favored the tranquility of forests and springs, letting birds choose his dwelling. His disciples, including Zhang Zhige, in the *gengchen* year, ventured to this mountain. Through overgrown vines and secluded paths, they sought out the old site, finding it perfectly suited to their hearts. Thus, they began construction.

In the spring of the *xinsi* year, with the approval of Prefect Xu of the province, Master Abiding Cloud was invited to reside on this mountain. He arrived as summoned, and before long, seekers of the Dao flocked to him, their empty departures becoming full returns—so numerous they could not be counted. Beneath his guidance, all were venerable elders of great virtue, their conduct simple and their truth luminous. As disciples multiplied, the abbey took shape.

In the spring of the *bingxu* year, they petitioned Master Changchun to preside over the Yellow Register Jiao rites. The master then bestowed the name *Abiding Clouds Abbey* upon it. Thereafter, its fame spread in all directions. Later, officials and commoners of the capital entreated him to leave the mountain and reside at the Tianchang Abbey in Yanjing.

In the autumn of the *dinghai* year, after the master ascended in the clouds, the great teacher led his followers southward. Wherever they passed, transformation followed. Commanderies and counties welcomed them at their outskirts, and new abbeys arose while old ones were restored—too many to count—all overseen by his disciples. Most notably, at the site of Ancestral Master Chongyang’s ascension in the Southern Capital, they devotedly built the Chaoyuan Abbey, grand and magnificent.

Master Abiding Cloud, in establishing virtue and merit, began at Central Pan and achieved greatness at Liangyuan. His support of the true wind and aid to the mystic teachings were, indeed, products of the era’s prosperity. This record captures but a fraction of the truth, for the master’s legacy defies mere words.

Future scholars should take heed and strive earnestly.

**Inscription:**
The Dao’s essence, vast and formless,
manifests through those who embody it.
Mountains, though unequal in height,
are named for the immortals who grace them.
This is the hidden principle of things,
the meeting of heaven and human affairs.

Master Tian, a paragon among men,
radiant as jade and stone,
pure as the wellspring’s source.
His spirit’s transformations defy measure,
leaving no trace behind.
Though mountains bear his name,
he held fast to its truth.
Long he dwelt among the Buddhists,
yet now returns at last.
Apes and cranes gather,
clustering like morning clouds.
Master Abiding Cloud once more upholds this path,
disseminating the mystic wind
to the farthest reaches.
Wang and Tian, transcending dualities,
unite in a thousand-year convergence,
passing the torch of transmission.
Pine winds and bamboo moonlight,
the sounds of water and hues of mountains—
these reveal our lineage’s essence,
found only in the attainment of stillness.

Mountain and boat shift in silence,
no step may tarry.
Beyond the Twofold Mystery lies the ascent—
strive to emulate it.

**Stele for the Restoration of Huichong Abbey at Gaotang**

In the boundless expanse of nowhere’s realm,
amid the vast wilderness,
two wanderers beyond the world emerged:
one named Yan Zhen,
the other Yong Zhen.
Yan bore the surname Jia, styled Zhixi;
Yong bore the surname Li, styled Zhiduan.
Yan’s ancestors hailed from Jun,
Yong’s family arose in Lan—
Jun to the south, Lan to the north,
separated by thousands of miles.
Yet these two, roaming the world together,
shared a single aspiration.
Both embraced the Daoist arts as their calling,
carrying forward the legacy of Changchun and Qinghe
with unwavering devotion.
Their faith was pure and steadfast,
their resolve sharp as a blade,
sweeping away delusion
until their bones stood gaunt,
transcending the vulgar world.
Their vision pierced the whole ox,
their blade moved with effortless mastery.

Time knows no pause,
division no constancy—
as Water and Metal succeed one another,
valleys shift and peaks transform.
Amid the turmoil of the Central Plains,
the north and south unsettled,
the people suffered in dire straits,
yet some, their hearts ashen and withered,
remained steadfast in the Way.
They treasured jade within,
dwelt in dust without—
none recognized them.

In the year *renchen*,
Yan and Yong met at the city barrier by the Luo River.
Their eyes met, spirits aligned,
they smiled in silent accord,
hearts in perfect harmony,
and became friends.
Sometimes they shared packed meals,
sometimes labored for their own joy—
for over twenty years,
their bond was unbroken,
strong as metal, fragrant as orchids.

At Chongtang’s slope stood the ruins of an old hermitage.
There, the two gathered tiles and bricks,
leveled the ground,
planted and built,
raising halls and chambers.
They laid out vegetable plots and gardens,
nestled against hills, beside streams,
lining them with verdant pines
and interspersing them with flowering trees.
The seclusion of a hidden paradise,
the depth of a numinous grotto—
nothing surpassed this.
Thus was Huichong Abbey born.

Within it, the two dwelt content,
heedless of the clamor of markets,
their ears as if deaf,
their eyes untouched by the world’s splendor.
No schemes lodged in their hearts,
their inner emptiness remained undimmed.
Their actions matched others’,
yet their cultivation set them apart—
true guardians of Hun Dun’s realm.
How distant they were from those
who jostle for precedence,
who sit in greed and never suffice!
Could they ever be spoken of in the same breath?
The gap between inner and outer is vast indeed.

On the first day of the fifth lunar month in the year *bingchen*,
I inscribe this in homage.

**Inscription:**
The heart of the mystic teaching,
deeply rooted, naturally perfected.
Realization is no delusion—
only the One, only purity.
The great body whole,
must be still, must be clear.
Centered and upright,
it forms and illuminates itself.
The Dao transmitted to these two,
Yan and Yong by name.
Friends like unbroken gold,
their fragrance like orchids.
Below, they nurture the earth;
above, they serve the celestial round.
Seeming foolish, seeming wise,
as if drunk, as if sober.
At rest in the nest,
in motion with all things.
No path lost in the mountains,
no lock on the grotto’s door.
Tall trees stand in solemn ranks,
spiritual sprouts intertwine.
Heedless of the marketplace,
no different from hills and valleys.
Chickens and dogs roam and return,
a thatched hut their refuge.
The world’s flavors like wax in the mouth,
they share the sweetness of heaven’s rank.
No craving for rich fare,
eating and drinking as circumstance allows.
No span, no moment—
gazing up to the boundless expanse.

**Stele for the Perfected One Changchun’s Attainment of the Dao**

The Perfected One’s clan was the Qiu,
his personal name Chujī,
his courtesy name Tongmi,
his Daoist name Changchunzi.
His ancestral home was Qixia in Dengzhou.
From birth, he bore the bearing of an immortal...

Gifted with keen intelligence and broad understanding, his spirit soared with untrammeled grace, his insight and bearing far from common. Before reaching his twentieth year, he experienced a sudden awakening—casting off worldly burdens to seek the Mystery and visit masters.

In the spring of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era (1167), Chongyang arrived from the western lands of Shaanxi in search of kindred spirits. When he first reached Kunqian, the Perfected One heard of him and went to observe. At a single glance, their spirits met, and he took Chongyang as his teacher. Remaining close at his side, he delved into the profound depths of the Twofold Mystery, its truths unfolding day by day.

Soon after, like-minded seekers gathered: Master Danyang Ma, Master Changzhen Tan, Master Changsheng Liu, Master Yuyang Wang, and Master Guangning Hao. These several disciples, sharing the same teacher, forged bonds of fellowship beyond the world, sailing the vast sea of the Complete Perfection teachings. Through the transmission of master and disciple, each embraced the teachings and received their proper inheritance.

Before long, Chongyang took only Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu with him on his travels, their fame spreading across the Four Seas. Later, they went to Bian, lodging at the residence in Yuetai Ward, where he swiftly gathered the other disciples. After some time, Chongyang entrusted his final affairs to Danyang and, without illness, returned to the True.

The four disciples escorted his spirit back to be interred on Mount Zhongnan. Once the funeral rites were complete, each discussed their paths forward and set their aspirations in different directions. Thus, the Perfected One wandered through Qin and Long, dwelling in humble abodes by streams, a bamboo basket and gourd his only possessions, a straw cloak and hat his constant companions. Self and things alike forgotten, his mind abode in perfect tranquility.

After six years, he attained the subtleties—whether in action or stillness, speech or silence, every movement and gesture became an expression of the Dao’s workings. The gate of the Mystery swung open, the celestial treasury unfolded its shoulders; his wisdom-store overflowed, his eloquence poured forth like a boundless spring. A single word from his lips, and people vied to recite it. Those who heard of his renown came climbing mountains and crossing seas to behold him; those who entered his gate followed in his footsteps, seeking his counsel.

His fame resounded far and wide, a mountain and pole-star for all to revere.

In the spring of the second month of the *Dading Wushen* year, Emperor Shizong dispatched envoys to summon him to the imperial court, entrusting him with the oversight of the *Wanchun* Offering rites. By special decree, he was granted residence at the Quanzhen Hall. The Emperor received him in audience many times, inquiring about the Way of preserving peace. The Perfected One instructed him in restraining emotions and curbing desires, cultivating *qi* and nurturing the spirit, elucidating the essence of the Dao and virtue, and dissecting the principles of Heaven and humanity. The Emperor was greatly pleased and held him in even higher esteem.

In the *Mingchang Xinhai* year, he returned to the eastern seas and dwelled at the Taixu Abbey in Bindu, where fellow Daoists all revered him as their master. When disciples sought further instruction, he warned them of the consequences of merit, conduct, sin, and fortune. In his responses to all, he was like water poured into vessels—adapting to their shapes and sizes, filling them just enough. Many among his followers buried themselves among the common folk, some donning coarse clothing and subsisting on simple fare, their aspirations and integrity held in mutual esteem, unknown to the world. Thus, his teachings did not easily spread widely across the land.

At that time, the imperial court, having risen in accordance with the mandate of Heaven, ruled over the Central Plains. The north and south were newly united, and the Emperor’s virtue and renown reached the highest heavens. In the winter of the tenth month of the *Jimao* year, the Emperor dispatched his trusted envoy Liu Zhonglun with a light cavalry of several dozen, clearing the way to the seashore to convey the imperial summons. The Perfected One, recognizing the will of Heaven, did not refuse and set forth. Eighteen of his foremost disciples from the monastic community accompanied him. They journeyed northwest, braving hardships and dangers, crossing the vast deserts of the Dragon Sands, until they reached the imperial encampment. The Emperor, moved by his sincere devotion to the long journey, received him with profound courtesy.

One day, the Emperor inquired about the elixir of immortality. The Perfected One replied: *"There are classics of health preservation, but no elixir of immortality."* The Emperor praised his sincerity. Whenever he was summoned to the imperial presence, he urged restraint in killing, moderation in desires, and the virtues of compassion and filial piety. The Emperor commanded his scribes to record his words.

In the spring of the *Guiwei* year, by special decree, he returned to Yan. There, the Changchun Abbey was constructed, and he was appointed to preside over the Orthodox Daoist teachings, with all the robed and capped of the realm submitting to his authority. He was granted a golden tally, and his disciples traveled by imperial post to deliver memorials and receive audiences. The court exempted them from corvée labor. From then on, the mystic winds flourished, the Dao grew ever more luminous, and the construction of abbeys spread like stars across the sky. Those who came to pay their respects arrived in clouds and mists. The expansion of the teachings was unparalleled in ancient times.

The Perfected One, having reached advanced age, made his home in Yanshan. He responded to supplications from all directions, and his influence extended near and far. When prayers were offered for clear skies or rain, the answers came as promised—so perfect was the communion between Heaven and humanity that not even a hair’s breadth stood between them.

In the sixth month of the *Dinghai* year, a great thunderstorm struck. The banks of the Taiye Pond collapsed, and its waters dried up; the cliffs of the northern pass crumbled with a thunderous roar. Upon hearing this, the Master said: *"The mountain’s collapse and the pond’s desiccation—shall I not follow them?"* Nine days after the first day of the seventh month in autumn, he indeed manifested his passing. He was eighty-one years old. His sacred remains were interred in the Chushun Hall of the White Cloud Abbey.

In the *Wuzi* year, his successor, the Perfected One of Pure Harmony, by imperial decree, bestowed upon him the honorific title *Changchun Hongdao Tongmi Perfected One*.

To speak of the Perfected One’s descent into the world: his virtue was constant, grasping the Mystic Pearl of the Most High and bearing the Dharma Seal of Chongyang. His resolve was firm as metal and stone, his nature pure as ice and frost. He dissolved the dusty passions of kalpas past and shattered the karmic obstructions of many lives. A numinous breeze brushed his sleeves, the moon of his nature hung in the sky. His great illumination reached the roots, trunks, springs, and sources, spreading like waves and branches. Knowing the constant, he abided in stillness; returning to destiny, he attained emptiness. The Golden Elixir was perfected, the fruits of fire-jujubes and frost-pears ripened. His spiritual powers were free and unobstructed, his responses to change boundless. He embodied the great completeness of Heaven and Earth, restored the great essence of antiquity and the present. He wandered without weariness, standing alone in solitary transformation. This is how the Perfected One perfected himself and became the great master of the world.

When the Dao resides in a place, all things naturally gravitate toward it. Harmonious *qi* flowed everywhere, reaching even the most distant realms. He oversaw the construction of abbeys and the establishment of teachings, revering the honored ones beyond form and expounding the mysteries within the Dao. He pointed to the celestial Perfected and opened the path, ferrying souls across the sea of suffering as a boat and oar. Those who ascended it would surely attain enlightenment; those who practiced it would surely reach the goal. All who had feet longed to follow him onto the Way. This is how the Perfected One propagated transformation and guided the lost, upholding the true teachings.

In the early days of the imperial dynasty, when the celestial armies first tested their strength, blood flowed like rivers, and flesh filled the hills and plains. At the wave of a yellow banner, corpses lay for ten thousand *li*; where the horses’ hooves trod, no land was left untouched; where blades fell, no people remained. Jade and stone burned together, metal and boiling water turned to dust. Fortunately, the Perfected One answered the imperial summons and journeyed to the encampment. His subtle words were heard again, and Heaven’s will turned back. Those who submitted were spared execution; those who surrendered their cities were granted mercy. He counseled generals to cherish life and urged the powerful to aid the people. In crises, he rescued them by many means; for captives, he ransomed them with wealth. Fugitive servants who followed the Dao were pardoned; menial laborers who advanced in virtue were freed. He saved lives from the depths of suffering and snatched them from the edge of blades, turning the wicked toward goodness—all through the vast propagation of the Dao’s transformation. Many in the world benefited from his protection, though some remained unaware. Though he benefited the world, he never spoke of his beneficence. Such was the Perfected One: his virtue transformed Heaven and Earth, his nature transcended the emperors of old.

Some, misled by what they heard or saw, presumed to measure him, but they grasped only the superficial. His traces were not his essence. What lay behind his traces was beyond the ken of the wisest or the eloquence of the most articulate—like wearing the sky on one’s head without knowing its height, or treading the earth without knowing its vastness. Those who presumed to measure him were like the blind groping at shadows.

Master Li, having come from afar, commanded this record of the Perfected One’s deeds. It shall be engraved in stone to preserve his legacy, a repayment of the debt owed to one’s honored teacher. Duty forbade refusal, so I have followed his request, fasting and purifying myself before inscribing these words.

Its inscription reads:

The Perfected Lord of Everlasting Spring,
his breast pure as ice and snow.
The finest essence of mountains and seas,
the hero among men.
Subtle thoughts he invariably mastered,
refined and utterly pure.
He transcended illusory realms at once,
dwelling on high in the Nine Pures.
Descending to become the Emperor’s teacher,
his radiance illuminated the divine capital.
Alone he came, alone he went—
both origin and nearness in himself.
Myriad transformations of the creative mechanism,
yet our lineage remains one.
Long life and enduring vision,
the accumulation of layered virtue.
After a thousand years, the encounter arrives,
and submerged suffering ceases at once.
Unknowing, unperceiving,
the waves of dark grace reach all.
Great shelter for our gate,
boundless as the vault of heaven.

**Stele of the Xianning Qinghua Abbey**

Forty *li* west of the capital lies a valley called Huayan.
Here, the brilliance of mountains and waters gathers,
where bamboo and trees flourish in lush abundance.
To the left, it joins Duqu;
to the right, it meets Baiyun.
The level expanse of Jade Tablet stretches southward,
while Phoenix Perch rises behind.
At its heart lies the estate of the Xiahou,
and amid the shimmering jade and misty haze,
stands the abbey named Qinghua.

Its origins trace back to Commissioner-in-Chief Tian,
and the foundational efforts of Master Ru.
At the close of the Zhenyou era’s southern migration,
golden ramparts crumbled to dust,
people and things turned to ashes of calamity.
The people beyond the Yellow River and west of Shaan,
though restored after ruin, knew no peace.
War’s dust stirred ceaselessly,
the open wilds lay desolate,
and of all once possessed, nine-tenths were lost.
Who would take up the task of reviving the fallen,
healing the people’s wounds?

Then came Commissioner Tian, dispatched to revive the land—
a brief respite from affliction.
Commissioner Tian, styled Xiongzhu,
was a native of Quanzhou.
First renowned for his valor,
in the *renwu* year he was promoted to Marshal of Yangzhou,
concurrently serving as Military Commissioner.
From all directions, those who admired his virtue and righteousness
gathered to him unbidden.

In the autumn of the *guisi* year, the ninth month, for his meritorious service in quelling rebellions, he was promoted to Marshal of the Five Circuits of Shaanxi. He cared for soldiers and civilians alike, drawing towns and villages to him, and in the intervals of governance, he revered the Dao and its virtue. Whatever he undertook to repair or restore, he vigorously supported. Having long shared a bond like brothers with Master Ru, upon hearing of the Master’s admonitions, he honored and trusted him deeply, embracing his teachings in word and deed. The worthy and the wicked alike followed him, and he released over a thousand families of captives—surely a sign of his enlightened understanding.

Master Ru, whose given name was Zhijiu, bore the surname Ru. A native of Quanzhou, he had pursued the Dao from youth, studying under the True Man Lou Yun for many years. He mastered its profound mysteries and traveled widely with staff and sandals, journeying west to Jiyang. In the *bingxu* year, elders invited him to reside at Qizhen Abbey. In the *guisi* year, Marshal Tian invited him to dwell at Yingxiang Abbey in Jingzhao. Soon after, he came to the village of the Xiahou clan, where he surveyed the surroundings—pristine and surpassingly fine. Once a retreat for renowned scholars and enlightened gentlemen to wander and gather truth, it had fallen to neglect, overrun by the howls of foxes, hares, and wolves. He thus chose a secluded spot, clearing away the brambles and broken tiles to mark its bounds. The inner and outer fields, measured by the *mu*, totaled two hundred and eighty, and he established a deed to define their limits.

There Master Ru built his abode, constructing a hall for the Perfected, a sanctuary for the True, and chambers for quiet retreat, arranged as circumstances allowed—sufficient to lodge the pure and refined. With solemn devotion, he performed rites of purification, reverently pledging his faith to the True, offering prayers for the imperial reign, and repaying the boundless grace of the throne. At the completion of the sanctuary, he sought an inscription from his master, who named it *Qinghua* ("Pure Splendor").

In the fourth month of the *renzi* year’s summer, the True Man of Perpetual Constancy, bearing the imperial mandate, journeyed to offer sacrifices at the famous mountains and great rivers. Finding leisure, he visited this place and, delighted by its refined landscape and noble people, stayed two nights before departing. Behold: the heavens unfold their pattern, the earth nurtures its beauty, the mountains stand in stillness, the waters flow in verdant clarity—here alone does one move free of vulgarity, purity penetrating to the bone and spirit. Truly this is a fitting abode for those who cultivate the heart and refine the nature, where one may dwell from dawn to dusk, remaining steadfast even in haste or peril. The numinous and the earthly, in their mutual regard, lend their aid. Who could fully fathom the subtlety of his self-attained mastery?

One day, an attendant arrived without delay, entreating me to record these events. Unable to decline with feeble words, I have followed his request and written plainly. Its inscription reads:

Amidst emerald forests and jade-like peaks, the visage of Fengyuan stands revealed. Beholding the sun’s pure radiance, one inquires into the misty haze. Profoundly penetrating to bone and spirit, it stills and sweeps away the mind’s deceits. Clouds and rosy dawns lead the chorus, jade laughter their refrain. Here one wanders, here one abides, finding peace and repose. The dwelling is a singular chamber, its structure pivoting on a central axis. The numinous gate bears no lock, the cavernous portal no bar. Thus is it made the lotus hut of those who attain the Dao, a place where perfected immortals come and go.

*Stele Inscription of the Great Fast by Huang Ju of Biling*

The Dao moves and gives rise to qi; qi transforms and gives rise to form. Forms vary in magnitude and subtlety, manifesting as flying and hidden, moving and still, growing and withering. The movement of qi entails ascent and descent, waxing and waning, birth and extinction, decay and flourishing. Like the revolving of the ten thousand images, it knows no beginning nor end; like the succession of the four seasons, it is neither ancient nor modern. Such is the constant principle of Heaven, the inexhaustible treasury of the Creator.

Yet when the turning of qi brings renewal and change, when the cycles of time reach their end and begin anew, none may remain passive and await fate, nor submit without resistance. When the moment is ripe, men hasten to seize it by force; when the moment has passed, they cling to their losses and contend by force. Thus do corpses lie for a thousand miles, the slain fill the cities—some perish by blade and arrow, some by wood and stone, some by fire and water—throughout the ages without respite, year upon year without cease. The plains are sated with human flesh, the rivers and valleys run with human blood, for they have defied Heaven and gone against the times.

From the Tang and Wu dynasties onward, at every dynastic transition, it has ever been thus. Since the august founding of the Great Dynasty, when the Jin lost its mandate, warfare has known no end, continuing to this day for nearly forty years. Wherever the hooves of warhorses tread, golden ramparts crumble to dust; wherever blades descend, men and things are reduced to ashes. Valleys become hills, south becomes north, households are exterminated, ten gates stand nine empty, and even the solitary survivor finds no escape. Those who narrowly escape execution linger in lonely misery, their breath faint; those whose clans are annihilated and lineages severed spend their years in desolate searching. To whom may they appeal? Their hearts grow cold in vain.

Beyond the Yellow River’s flow, at the borders of the battlefield, peril is greater still. Souls are trapped, spirits bound, enduring long kalpas without release—only through the merit of the Mysterious may they find deliverance. Now, by the grace of the fast’s sponsors, certain officials and others, great compassion has arisen, and the highest good has been set in motion. At this abbey, they have established the Great Fast of the Primordial Yellow Register, making offerings to the Three Pure Ones of Jade Clarity and all the sagely hosts. Ascension to immortality stands opposite deliverance of souls, marking the divergence of good and evil paths; the Southern Palace borders the Northern Bureau, revealing the distinction between immortals and mortals. The altar is purified, its precincts arrayed in solemn order, to invite the descent of perfected transcendents and beseech their radiant aid.

They have further invited the Perfected One of Resting Clouds from the Court of Primordial Harmony in the Southern Capital to oversee the fast’s proceedings. Their intent is to deliver the unclaimed orphaned souls of this region, as well as the lingering spirits of ancestors from various families—those with kin but no means—attaching their names to the register and summoning their souls. It is hoped that filial sons and dutiful grandsons, mindful of their clans and ancestors, will each offer their sincerest devotion and gaze upon the true sages. Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles serve as the luminous radiance of wisdom; the stars and constellations of the altar ground become the realm of the Tuṣita Heaven. May all—whether their mouths [are sealed] or [words remain]—share in this grace; may all who have sunk into decay and desiccation be revived.

Ascending the compassionate vessel, the sorrows of the unseen and the seen alike are resolved; all receive deliverance, and blessings flow anew. May the ancestral line ascend in transcendence. Above, may the imperial realm stand firm forever, the sagely virtue ever renewed; may the frontiers know peace, soldiers and people rejoice in their livelihood. May the ten directions and three realms, the six paths and four modes of birth, the sentient and the insentient, all partake of the Dao’s blessing.

Now this sacred altar is prepared in purity, the rites conducted with solemnity. A brief account of these events is set down here and inscribed in stone.

*Yunshan Collection, Volume Seven concluded*
*Yunshan Collection, Volume Eight: Stele Inscriptions*

Stele Inscription for the Capital Salvation Ritual
Composed by Perceiver of the Constant Dao, Ji Zhizhen

In the winter of the *jiwei* year, the tenth month, the Eighth Subordinate Officer of the Western Freezing Prefecture’s Crown Prince’s Court, having long cherished a vow, undertook the supreme Yellow Register Offering. At the Yingxiang Abbey of this prefecture, from spring through autumn, halls and chambers were repaired and refurbished, and the ritual altar was prepared. Without hesitation, the Perching Cloud Perfected was invited to serve as the Great Master of Salvation, presiding over the ritual assembly.

On the appointed day, Daoist adepts were summoned, ritual implements arranged, and documents dispatched to announce the event to the Illuminated Perfected of the Three Realms and the deities above and below. With fasting, purification, and concentrated thought, the rites were conducted to shelter all beings.

Three days prior, the ceremonial observances commenced with reverent offerings to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. The intent was to deliver both the distant and recently deceased of the ancestral line, as well as the orphaned souls of the realm with none to claim them, including those from families lacking proper sacrifices, who came to the altar to be included in the rites. From this to that, none were near or distant—all relied upon the incense and cultivation, universally praying for transcendence.

Thus, the Dao was practiced for three days and two nights. At dawn on the day following the full moon, the altar was dispersed, and the rites concluded. Such wholehearted devotion was an expression of benevolence and filial piety.

To speak of it: Heaven and Earth share one *qi*, and all things and self share a single root. As the myriad transformations ebb and flow, forms are arrayed and distinctions made. Interwoven with the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases, governed by the cyclical progression of the Four Seasons, change renews daily, and transformation knows no end—such is the constant movement of *qi*. Yet, once a form is received, it is grasped as one’s own possession. Thus, beings contend with blades and opposition, giving rise to strength and weakness, rise and fall, ceasing only in death.

Little do they realize that *qi* is what they serve, time what they follow, fate what they abide, and principle what they inhabit. Every stirring and arising has a beginning and an end. Gain and loss, survival and extinction—these are the creations of Heaven. Who can resist them? Those who act against them fail; those who cling to them lose; those who oppose them perish; those who comply with them flourish. Those who contend with cunning are exhausted; those who contend with force are defeated. Indeed, humanity’s inability to overcome Heaven has long been so.

Now, the imperial dynasty responds to the mandate, encompassing all within the Central Plains. From the northern deserts to the southern Han lands, from the Eastern Sea to the Western Freezing regions, diverse paths and disparate ways have all been unified. There is no second Dao in the world, no divided hearts within the realm. The past’s warfare and slaughter have been fully endured; the extinction of ancestral sacrifices has been fully witnessed. Comparing past and present, not one in ten thousand remains. Comparing oneself to others, one’s own body enjoys peace and fortune, branches and leaves flourish, with human rank as a companion and Heaven’s protection as a bestowal.

Reflecting on one’s own good fortune, one thinks of the world’s misfortune; reflecting on one’s own kin, one pities those without kin. Sharing *qi* and root, how can one not be moved? Thus, the long-cherished vow was fulfilled, the sincere heart laid bare. Relying on the Primordial’s compassion to save beings, the great Yellow Register Fast was initiated. Invoking the universal power of the Perfected, one hoped for the illumination of the Three Realms, shining a single torch into the dark underworld to open the paths of the nether regions.

Gathering and guiding the myriad *qi*, long-sunken souls were returned to their source; harmonizing the hundred spirits, orphaned souls were all uplifted. Together, they rode the harmonious *qi*, subtly aiding the imperial enterprise. With the written word and military might unified, the myriad regions complied with transformation, and the Four Seas returned to benevolence—this was the utmost wish of a minister and child.

The offering altar was prepared in purity, the ritual conducted with solemnity. This inscription was carved in stone to record the merit, that it might endure forever. Facts were gathered and recorded truthfully.

The inscription reads:

All things flourish in profusion,
Each returning to its root.
Those departed, never to return—
These are the masterless souls.
The *po* that cling to their bonds
Cannot find their gate.
Clinging to grass, attaching to trees,
They know not where they abide.

How much worse in the dust of war,
Unceasing for years on end?
Slaughtered and annihilated,
Not one in ten thousand remains.
Startled souls, lost and bewildered,
Wander and drown in their plight.
Following transformations, they come and go,
Passing through kalpas as stone endures.

Now, by the grace of the ritual’s patron,
A heart of supreme goodness is aroused.
The Yellow Register’s grand fast is reverently performed,
To uplift the sunken and the submerged.
Throughout the earth beneath heaven,
From ancient times to the present,
None are distant, none are near—
All rely on the mighty sound.

Vacant *po* return,
Wandering souls regain their origin.
Those who stood in concealment now appear,
Those who stood like swine now vanish.
Neither here nor there—
All dwell within the bound of the Dao.
The subtle *qi* meets in darkness,
And peace may yet prevail.

**Stele of the Grand Yellow Register Fast**

Born between heaven and earth,
We dwell but briefly, like travelers in a lotus pavilion,
A hundred years of fleeting light—
Swift as a white colt flashing past a gap,
Gone in an instant.
Nothing remains unchanged.

Yet within these few decades,
Some live long, some die young,
Each with a destined form,
None knowing their own fate,
Morning and evening the same.

How many seek to transcend the workings of transformation,
To enter the realm of the Great Void?
From this point downward,
Who can strive for such a path?

As children, we are the cast-off husks of our parents.
Between life and death,
How shall we repay them?
Thus, in life, we honor them with love and reverence;
In death, we mourn with sorrow.
To remember them in village rites is the constant duty of propriety.

Reflecting on our parents,
When they were alive,
They were led astray by the self and the myriad illusions,
Beguiled by the seven emotions and six desires,
Ever deluded, ever acting in vain.
Faults piled high as mountains,
Virtue thinner than a thread.

Now, their bones lie discarded upon the earth,
Their souls cast into the void.
Extinguished, never to continue—
Yet if they do not perish, where do they abide?
Are they here? Or there?
Do they fall to the trials of the nether courts,
Or wander the palaces of heaven?
Do they pass through the six paths and four births,
Or return to the world of men?

Alas—
None can know.

Those who dwell in leisure may yet ponder this:
If there truly exists a sovereign arbiter,
Who governs the divergent paths of the seen and unseen,
Yet remains obscure and unrecognized—
Lost in boundless, unfathomable darkness—
How can this not be a cause for profound sorrow?

Thus, the filial heart never forgets;
Longing to repay the root of one’s being,
Its boundless grace moves one to tears of blood and wounded sorrow.
Without the merit of profound cultivation,
By what means can one deliver them?

One must therefore offer utmost sincerity and reverence,
Laying bare the depths of one’s heart,
Praying to the exalted Perfected Ones,
Hoping for their merciful deliverance,
That the departed souls may transcend suffering,
Never again to encounter the realms of torment—
Such is the principle of resonant response.

On this day, so-and-so offers this rite for the deliverance of their late parents,
On this appointed day of the month,
A grand Yellow Register fast is solemnly conducted,
With offerings presented to the sacred ranks.
A certain master is invited to preside over the jiao rites,
And the divine altar’s pure assembly is commanded to present memorials and petitions,
Following the prescribed liturgy.

The ritual begins with the issuance of documents on such-and-such a day,
And concludes with the burning of the memorial on such-and-such a day.
Having gathered for this assembly,
All approach the sacred altar with purity,
Pouring forth the sincerity of their hearts,
United in their prayers for deliverance—
Such is the utmost devotion of filial children and benevolent persons.

With solemn dignity in place and the rites conducted in strict order,
The sincerity of repaying one’s roots is fittingly inscribed in stone,
To be witnessed by future generations.
This also serves as an encouragement to virtue in turn.

Its inscription reads:
In serving one’s parents,
Even in death, one attends them as in life.
With a single offering,
Tears of blood express one’s sincerity.
The spirits of parents,
Dwell in the unseen.
Longing to repay their roots,
One fulfills heaven’s constant principle.

Approaching this jade palace,
The realm of the Jade Clarity,
Praying with purity,
All turbid qi is dispelled.
The Perfected gather like spokes to a hub,
All the sages unite in covenant.
Clouds and mist converge,
The master’s virtue is fully realized.
Compassionate clouds and dharma rain,
Resound like thunder and lightning.
Within the refining fire altar,
Karmic burdens are burned away, and souls ascend.

**Stele of Nanchang Abbey**

The Dao does not discard anything,
And nothing exists outside the Dao.
It permeates all within the six directions,
Uniting the vast and the minute in all existence—
Nothing is excluded.

Thus, heaven attains it and becomes clear,
Earth attains it and becomes tranquil,
The Three Luminaries attain it and shine,
The Four Seasons attain it and turn in harmony,
And the sages attain it to establish teachings for the world.

It is the uncarved block of the nameless,
Descending to become the guiding master of transformation.
Its wondrous workings flourish,
Its divine power shines forth.
When the wellspring of the numinous is unleashed,
It rightly steadies the raging currents.
Though its manifestations vary with the times,
It adapts to the rise and fall of the world.

The Dao neither increases nor diminishes,
Yet its application waxes and wanes.
Since the dawn of creation,
Through the primordial chaos, its origins are unrecorded.
From the middle antiquity onward,
Its exponents have arisen in succession.

In the time of Fuxi, there was Yuhua Zi;
In the time of Shennong, Dacheng Zi;
In the time of the Yellow Emperor, Guangcheng Zi;
In the time of Zhuanxu, Chijing Zi;
In the time of Gaoxin, Lutu Zi;
Under Yao, there was Wucheng Zi;
Under Shun, Yinshou Zi;
Under Yu, Zhenxing Zi;
Under Tang, Xize Zi.

These persons and their virtues,
All emerged from the classics and traditions of the Dao,
Serving as imperial teachers across generations.
Their profound influence rippled like great waves,
Extending even to the humblest beings,
All recorded in the sacred canon.

Yet some, though their names faded from memory,
Left behind only faint traces—
Their deeds beyond all reckoning.

In the eras of Yin and Zhou,
Laozi emerged.
He blunted sharpness and resolved entanglements,
Responding to circumstances with transformation.
Returning to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,
He expounded on governing people and serving heaven.
The preservation of his two chapters and four supplements,
Alongside the teachings of the Hundred Schools,
Was like a forest of jade vying in splendor,
Or orchids and friends competing in fragrance.

Those with hearts like frost and snow,
Clad in coarse robes yet holding jade within;
Those who wore star-crowned hats and moon sashes,
Carrying double baskets on their shoulders—
The branches of scriptures and diagrams,
The proliferation of codes and canons,
The brewing of jade nectar and elixirs,
The ingestion of five metals and eight minerals,
Some refined their forms and circulated qi,
Others exhaled the old and inhaled the new,
Warding off evil and expelling demons,
Employing talismans to govern spirits.

These were urgent practices for worldly adaptation and bodily nurturance,
All auxiliary to the Dao,
Yet not the Dao itself.
In their pursuit of returning to the root and restoring life’s mandate,
They often overlooked its essence.

In recent times, Chongyang,
Heaven-endowed and divinely appointed,
Cast off worldly entanglements and relinquished dust,
Establishing the root and source of the trunk,
Sweeping away the waves and branches.
He aided the present with purity and truth,
Responding with gentleness, humility, and modesty.
He embodied the great completeness of heaven and earth,
And perfected the grand essence of past and present.

The Dao was transmitted to several disciples by the Eastern Sea,
All of whom embraced and propagated it,
Responding to the call and harmonizing in song,
Transforming the world.

By the early reign of the sagely ancestor of the imperial dynasty,
Both Dao and virtue were revered;
After the summoning of Master Changchun,
The gates of the tradition were widely opened.
Within the chambers, seats were never empty,
And shoes filled the thresholds outside.
When the succeeding master, Qinghe Zhenren, assumed the role of grand preceptor,
He was honored with the imperial mandate,
Receiving dignitaries and welcoming disciples.
Abbeys stood in sight of one another,
And even in distant frontiers, deep mountains, and vast marshes,
There were always those who followed the path.

To the north of this pavilion,
Less than a league away,
Lies a hamlet called Tunzhu,
And within this prosperous village stands Nanchang Abbey.
It was founded by Master Baoguang,
Whose surname was Zhu and given name Zhiming,
A native of this land,
Baoguang being his Daoist name.

In his prime, he was exceptionally perceptive,
Renouncing the secular to pursue the Dao.
He studied under Master Baoyang, Liu Zhifu,
A foremost disciple of the Great Ancient Perfected One.
The master personally guided him,
Transforming him day by day and month by month,
Until he received the seal of transmission.

In middle age, he returned to his parents’ homeland,
Surveying his former residence,
Only to find it overgrown and desolate,
Little more than its foundations remaining.
The master led his disciples to reclaim the wasteland,
Clearing paths and cultivating the wilds,
Acquiring land measured in acres, half a qing in total.
When the prefectural lord, Magistrate Zhang, granted an official document to authorize it,
They began construction—
Raising beams, erecting walls,
Planning and building—
And in less than ten days,
The great work was accomplished.

A hall was dedicated to the Most High,
A meeting hall for the purchase of blessings,
Where the pure countenance of the Perfected could be venerated,
Fulfilling the deepest wishes of the people.
Offerings were made with reverence at dawn,
And incense burned steadfastly at dusk.

The great work upholds the imperial enterprise,
Extending the sacred mandate’s vast prosperity,
Its blessings reaching far and near,
Its waves touching all living beings.
To repay the root and honor the master,
To requite the nurturing of virtue and power—
This is the very purpose here.

At the outset of its completion,
A name was sought from the patriarchal master,
And it was inscribed as "Nanchang."
After the work was done,
The master concealed his wild words,
And departed with that which cannot be spoken.

What has been transmitted through the ages,
All that is heard and seen—
These are not the true essence.
Traces are not the root.
The root lies in tranquility and stillness,
In emptiness and non-action—
This is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth,
The rectitude of the Dao and virtue,
Preserved within our lineage alone,
Beyond the reach of perception or hearing.

Thus, the ephemeral vanishes,
The withered revives,
People are no longer illusory beings,
Nor things mere phantom realms.
This is how the sage instructs humanity,
And therein lies the way of master and disciple.

The construction of this abbey and temple
Takes form to manifest sincerity and luminous ritual,
Serving as a means for the state’s cultivation and refinement—
Profound indeed is its significance!

When the abbey’s overseer, Liu, arrived without hesitation to request a record of these events,
I sought to recount the achievements of those who came before,
Hoping to inspire those yet to come.
Thus, I could not decline with feeble words,
And so I followed his request and wrote plainly.

Its inscription reads:

The immortals of successive ages,
Their axis turns in perfect round.
In decline or rise, they follow the world’s flow,
In concealment or revelation, they obey heaven’s decree.

From Chongyang the source arose,
Changchun flourished most brightly.
The true wind was greatly revived,
The orthodox mandate fully upheld.

There was one called Baoyang,
Whose heir preserved its radiance.
A descendant of the Great Antiquity,
His Dao’s worth spread in all directions.

In his native land, he planned and built,
Perfecting this sublime sanctuary.
With blessings as wings he sustained it,
With virtue as carriage he bore it.
In wandering or dwelling, in rest or sleep,
He never forgot his devout cultivation.

For the emperor’s longevity he prayed,
That earth endure and heaven last long.
For the people’s fortune he entreated,
With boundless abundance and blessings.
Morning and evening, with earnest devotion,
A single incense burned in the hearth.

*An Encounter with a True Record: The Story of Chaoyun of Qin*

There was a man named Chaoyun of Qin,
His clan and homeland unknown.
To escape the corvée of Qin Shi Huang’s wall-building,
He fled to the foothills of Mount Taihang,
Pushing through brambles and vines,
Scaling perilous heights,
Pressing ever onward toward the remote and secluded,
Where even bird tracks and human traces could not reach—
Only then did he stop.

He ate from the trees and drank from the streams,
Until he came upon a dense forest of thickets,
Where he built a nest and dwelt above,
Hence his name, Chaoyun—Nest Cloud.

This man,
Once entangled in the world’s clamor and constraint,
Shed its burdensome ties,
Breaking free from its snares like a fleeing hare.
With trees and rocks as neighbors,
Deer and boars as companions,
He escaped the suffering of human servitude and oppression,
Living freely and unrestrained,
Vowing to spend his life thus.

Long accustomed to emptiness and stillness,
He passed days and months in quietude,
Finding them ever longer;
Walking amidst clouds and mist beyond the world,
He could not contain his joy.
Recalling the past,
Amid the tumult of clamoring crowds,
Braving the suffocating yellow dust,
It was as if trapped in a searing furnace or boiling cauldron,
Steamed and scorched—
Who could describe such torment?

Now,
Though he trod paths where jackals and tigers roamed,
Climbed cliffs where apes and monkeys dwelled,
Cut off from the world,
What else could he seek?
Only to attain ease and tranquility,
To avoid disturbing the natural course of life.

Whether walking or standing,
Sitting or lying,
He would pause and gaze around:
The mountains, silent;
The waters, clear and cold.
Birds sang in harmony,
Beasts grew tame and familiar.
Grasses and trees vied in beauty,
Peaks and ridges competed in grandeur—
He deemed Penglai’s paradise,
The Jasper Pool’s fairyland,
The grotto-heavens and celestial palaces,
None could surpass this.

At times,
Beneath pine shadows and grassy paths,
Hair unbound, he sang as he walked;
At the forest’s edge or by the stream,
His solitary form danced with its shadow—
Such was his joy.

After years of dwelling here,
Worldly cares vanished entirely.
He knew not whether the world had turned to Han or Wei,
Nor whether his own fleeting form
Was a thing or himself.

He loathed yellow essence,
Feared the allure of green herbs,
Drank from pure springs,
Sat upon white stones.
His form dissolved into reverie,
As if in a light slumber.

Then,
An aged immortal appeared—
Youthful temples, square pupils,
A fine beard, hair coiled in a topknot—
Holding a sprig of lingzhi,
Treading auspicious clouds,
He descended beside him.
Pointing, he called out:
“You, who are infatuated with mountains and forests,
Enamored of springs and stones,
Differ little from those who lose themselves in the dusty world.
Having long delighted in stillness,
Sorrow and movement must follow.
I now bestow upon you the nameless simplicity to anchor it,
That you may break free from the bonds of stillness
And ascend beyond Kunlun’s peak.
Do you desire this?”

Chaoyun rose abruptly,
Bowed deeply, and pressed his forehead to the ground,
Then crawled forward on his knees:
“Dare I ask the method?”

The old immortal commanded him to sit in silence,
Close his eyes and cover his ears.
Then, with a sharp blade, he split his chest and removed his heart,
Before sealing it again,
Applying a divine medicine.
“Nameless simplicity,
The seed of immortals and sages,
Now rests within your breast.
Guard it well.”

Thereafter,
Chaoyun entered a profound void,
A deep obscurity—
He knew not how or why,
Only that it was so.

After a long while,
As if awakening from sleep,
Or sobering from drunkenness,
He looked around—
The old immortal was gone.
He touched his chest—
It was whole, as before.
Suddenly,
He felt hollow and refreshed,
His spirit bright and clear,
Harmonious qi spreading throughout,
His entire being at peace.
An inner celestial light shone forth,
Revealing his innate purity.

Then,
As if newly awakened,
He felt vast and unbound,
The breadth of the sea could not compare to his greatness,
The leisure of clouds and waters could not match his ease.
He passed through the mysterious barrier,
His wisdom treasury now lucid,
Attaining the sight of no-seeing,
The knowledge of unknowing.

Merging with heaven and earth in primordial chaos,
Harmonizing with the myriad things as one,
There was no other, no self.
Within and without, vast and deep,
All was one body, all-pervading.
Great and small, coarse and fine,
All were contained in a single nature.

Then,
He danced and leapt,
Chanting soundless poems,
Playing a flute without holes,
Strumming a zither without strings,
Singing a song of no-birth—
Its resonance shook heaven and earth,
Yet the world never heard it.

Thus,
Dragon roars and phoenix cries,
Cranes dancing, simurghs soaring,
Treading the void, riding the wind,
Commanding qi—
All could be done,
And could not but be done.

After dwelling in the mountains for many years,
Woodcutters and hunters occasionally glimpsed his strangeness.
His fame could not be concealed,
Paths gradually formed,
And one or two seekers of the Dao came to visit.

There was a scholar, Rong Bohua,
Who, hearing of Chaoyun’s reputation,
Braved rugged terrain to see him.
Accompanied by several others,
Upon arrival, they saw Chaoyun’s withered, mountain-worn form
And reproached him:
“A true man’s breast cradles brocade,
His spirit exhales rainbows,
He stands above all things,
His grace nourishes even the grasses.
He builds great deeds,
Attains great renown,
Walks the golden halls,
Sounds the jade chimes.
Among birds, he is the phoenix;
Among beasts, the dragon.
Better to be the beak of a chicken
Than the rump of an ox—
This is the shared desire of all.
Yet you alone, so despondent and cramped,
Cower in these deep mountains and barren valleys,
Scarcely better than a well-frog or ditch-turtle.
How can you bear such indignity?”

Chaoyun lifted his head, sighed to the heavens,
And slowly replied:
“Have you not seen
Between heaven and earth,
The flow of a single qi,
The opening and closing of yin and yang,
The transformations of clouds and rain,
The illumination of sun and moon,
The stirring of wind and thunder,
The life and death of frost and dew?
Each serves its purpose differently—
All arise from heaven and tend upward.”

The stillness of mountains, the flow of rivers,
The dryness of fire, the hardness of metal,
The growth of trees, the firmness of stone,
The flight of birds, the running of beasts,
The swimming of fish, the movement of insects—
Each soars, creeps, wriggles, or crawls in its own way,
All rooted in earth and drawn downward.

Their inherent divisions are fixed, unchangeable.
One cannot resent what is already determined,
Nor foresee the ceaseless transformations of the new.
Yet men, with their cunning calculations,
Seek to seize by force—
How could one leap ranks and attain what is not theirs?
This is what is meant by "not knowing the constant and acting recklessly."

The fineness of an autumn hair, the vastness of Mount Tai,
The longevity of Pengzu, the early death of Yanling,
The wealth of Chong, the poverty of Xian—
All are fixed by their inherent divisions.
Viewed through the Dao,
All forms and numbers, fleeting as they are, dissolve into emptiness.
Thus great and small, long life and early death,
Wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness—
None differ in essence.

Within me abides that which is neither great nor small,
Neither form nor number,
Neither long life nor early death,
Neither wealth nor poverty,
Neither noble nor base.
It endures through kalpas, unchanging—
What then should I resent?

Bohua said: *"One with extraordinary talent serves the world and shelters others.
But you, though human, are of no use to the world—
You are merely a useless man."*

Chaoyun replied: *"You see uselessness as suffering,
Yet do not know the harm of being useful.
All things that live,
Bound by the constraints of body and mouth,
Are controlled by others and suffer in their existence.
Like horses made to travel far,
Or oxen made to pull heavy loads—
Bridled in front, whipped from behind,
They endure the comfort of fodder and beans
Only to have their natural lives destroyed.
Thus it is said:
The skillful are always labored,
The wise are always anxious.
Straight trees are felled first,
Sweet wells are drained first.
Lacquer is cut for its use,
Cinnamon is broken for its flavor.
Fat is rendered for its light,
Charcoal is burned for its heat.
Fleas are boiled for their dye,
Birds are caged for their speech.
All these suffer because the world finds them useful—
They cannot rest in their natural state."*

Bohua said: *"Uselessness may be good,
But how does it nourish life?"*

Chaoyun replied: *"What the world calls 'nourishing life'
Is merely filling the mouth and body—
Knowing the tools of life,
But not its master.
What masters life is spirit.
When spirit abides, life endures;
When spirit departs, life ends.
To cling to life and seek nourishment
Is to violate the master of spirit—
Offering fragrance and flavor to the mouth and nose,
Colors and sounds to the ears and eyes,
Indulging the six desires, seven emotions,
Three poisons, five impurities,
Countless delusions and evils—
All harm the spirit.
When spirit is harmed, it departs;
When spirit departs, the body perishes;
When the body perishes, what life remains?
Thus what the world calls 'nourishing life'
Cannot preserve life—
Because it fails to embrace uselessness."*

Bohua said: *"What is the use of uselessness?"*

Chaoyun replied: *"Have you not seen
Water that is still and thus clear,
A mirror that is unstained and thus bright?
Things come, and it reflects them;
It responds but does not retain,
Illuminates but does not hoard,
Uses but is not used—
This is the use of uselessness.
Because it is useless, its body is never wearied and remains at rest.
Because it does not cling to illumination, its brightness is never harmed and remains constant.
If the heart seeks to be useful,
Eyes see without seeing,
Ears hear without hearing,
Mouth speaks without speaking,
Nose smells without smelling,
Hands grasp without grasping,
Feet walk without walking—
All limbs and senses become unruly,
Like one afflicted with wind-stroke or paralysis.
But when the heart is useless, the body serves its function.
When the vast heavens do nothing, the ten thousand images move of themselves.
When the great earth is incapable, the ten thousand things transform of themselves.
Useless—yet nothing is not used.
Thoughtless—yet nothing is not thought.
Actionless—yet nothing is not done.
Heaven and earth are connected,
Creation is the same,
Spirits cannot fathom it,
From the vast to the minute—
All reside within my nature,
Unchanged through ten thousand kalpas.
How could I concern myself with dust, chaff, or illusory forms?
Go—you are a vulgar man.
Do not disturb my affairs."*

Bohua stood dumbfounded, mouth agape, unable to speak.
After a long while, he bowed and departed.

**Record of Shenqing Abbey in Kaizhou**

The Dao flourishes in the world,
And the world flourishes through the Dao.
When Dao and world rise together,
All drink from the mysterious transformation,
Forgetting their grasping and scheming ways.
People daily turn toward goodness,
Preserving their natural state,
Never transgressing their allotted divisions or disrupting the constant—
Is this not an era of great peace?

What small aid does the Dao offer the world?

When the imperial court underwent revolution and all was in ruins,
After Master Changchun answered the summons,
His carriage rested at Yanran,
The stone marrow reopened,
The jade caskets were unsealed again,
And those across the land who turned toward the wind
Hastened to draw near.

Among those of surpassing resolve,
Who did what others could not,
There was Master Zhang—
He was such a man.
His name was Zhixin, his sobriquet Xiaoyaozi,
A native of Zhangchuan.
His nature was unyielding, scorning worldly entanglements.
During the chaos of the Zhenyou era’s southern migration,
Bandits gathered, attacking and plundering.
Fearing the disaster would reach him,
He saw his own body as the greatest peril.
He fled to the deep mountains and barren valleys,
Seeking a way to transcend the world—
But had not yet found it.

Hearing that Master Wang Qiyun was opening the Dao at Mount Pan,
And that many seeking the Way followed him,
He traveled a thousand *li* without hesitation,
Pressing forward to inquire into the truth—
And was deeply approved.
After a long time, he was permitted to join the assembly,
Attending reverently, never resting,
Exhausting its mysteries.

When he later descended the mountain,
He lived in a thatched hut, eating wild plants.
What his heart held
Was no longer what his former self could have done.
He took heaven and earth as his lotus hut,
His body as a temporary lodging,
Wearing hempen robes and a rope belt,
His face unwashed, his hair unkempt—
The passing of seasons and the changing of cold and heat
Meant nothing to him.

From beginning to end, his resolve never wavered.
He bore the form of a man,
Yet was without the passions of men.
He regarded the comings and goings of worldly things,
The entanglements of human affairs,
As but birds, sparrows, mosquitoes, or gnats passing before him—
Never once did they trouble his mind.
Could one who had not attained realization within
Ever be thus?

Truly, by guarding the spirit in stillness,
Concealing the self in profound obscurity,
He grasped that Great Root and Great Origin
Which has endured from ancient times to the present.

The world, observing from without,
Saw only his austere and arduous discipline,
Beyond what others could endure—
How could the common eye perceive the mysteries he had unlocked?

In the autumn of the *dinghai* year, in the seventh month,
The Master arrived at Chanyuan.
The townsfolk, struck by his uncommon presence,
Gazed upon him as though he were a spirit to be revered.
Magistrate Zhao, upon meeting him, earnestly entreated him to stay,
And lodged him in the Temple of the Divine Manifestation of the True Lord,
Sending provisions from time to time.
From then on, those who sought his gate
Came in such numbers that they could not all be counted.
His disciples numbered in the hundreds—
They sat without instruction,
Stood without discourse,
Yet departed filled where they had come empty.

Chief Cai, admiring his character,
Granted him fields beside his own temple,
Formally deeding the land to him.
There, a dwelling was built,
That he might reside and make it his home.
Commissioner Wang, praising his strict and solemn conduct,
Provided funds and support,
And the temple gradually took shape.
The main hall was restored to enshrine the Three Pure Ones,
Followed by the construction of halls and kitchens
To accommodate the quiet and the devout.
Quarters and chambers were arranged
To suit the blessed site.

Upon its completion,
A petition was sent to the Patriarchal Perfected One,
Who bestowed upon it the name *Divine Clarity*.

Let us consider this:
Man is established through the Dao,
And the Dao is magnified through man.
What is realized within
Manifests without.
Thus, when Master Kangcang dwelt in Lu,
The common people longed to offer him sacrifices as to She and Ji.
When Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi,
The wine-sellers vied to serve him with reverence.
For one who preserves the nature of the self
And harmonizes it with the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,
There is nothing that cannot be penetrated.
One who safeguards the harmony of the self
And unites it with the harmony of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,
There is nowhere that cannot be reached.
From this perspective,
To move the lofty and profound,
To stir ghosts and spirits,
To enter water and fire,
To pierce metal and stone—
All things, great and small, respond.
How much more so for men?

Who would not love and revere
One who offers harmony to others?
Master Zhang, styled Xiaoyao,
Truly possessed such virtue.

His disciple Zhao Zhiwan,
Recalling his master’s aspirations and conduct,
And reflecting on the nearness of his former dwelling,
Sought to engrave his story in stone to preserve his legacy,
And entreated me to compose this account.
Though I declined, he would not accept my refusal,
So I have gathered these details and set them down.

Recorded on the fifth day after the full moon of the first spring month,
In the year of *qiangyu*, the *dahuangluo* epoch.
*Collected Works from Cloud Mountain*, Volume Eight, concludes.
