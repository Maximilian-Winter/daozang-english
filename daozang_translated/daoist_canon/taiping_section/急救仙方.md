**An Anonymous Song Dynasty Compilation.** Eleven juan. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era, Taiping Section*.

**Preface to *Emergency Immortal Remedies***
In the art of medicine, nothing is more challenging than treating women’s ailments; among women’s ailments, none is graver than those of pregnancy and childbirth. Why are pregnancy and childbirth so grave? Because the affliction of one body concerns the life or death of both mother and child. Thus, *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold* places the section on women’s disorders at its very beginning—such was Sun Simiao’s meticulous intent. Though existing formulas for pregnancy and childbirth are abundant, many suffer from being cumbersome, obscure, or costly. Cumbersome remedies are difficult to prepare in emergencies; obscure ingredients are hard to obtain in remote villages; and costly ones are beyond the reach of the impoverished. Though these three shortcomings do not stem from any lack of benevolence on the part of the authors, those who benefit from such remedies are often but one in a thousand. This compilation, divided into three categories with miscellaneous disorders appended, does not aspire to the exhaustive breadth of other works. Yet it avoids the pitfalls of being cumbersome, obscure, or costly, and in essence, it covers the majority of critical conditions in pregnancy and childbirth. Thus, in emergencies, in remote villages, and in impoverished households, these remedies may be easily obtained. Even a single herb or plant can yield results—how unlike the three aforementioned difficulties! Should anyone make use of these formulas, they will come to recognize them as a treasure for the inner chambers.

**Diagnostic Verse**
Purple indicates cold damage,
Blue signals fright,
White denotes malnutrition,
Black arises from malign attack,
Yellow bespeaks spleen affliction.

Examine the child’s complexion and the creases on the second joint of the index finger—left for boys, right for girls. If the creases extend beyond three joints, the condition is difficult to treat. Observe from the lower joint upward.

**Quanzhen Purple Pill** treats infantile *bianzheng* (febrile growth phases), persistent fever, concurrent cold damage, lingering heat after *wenzhuang* (warmth taxation), abdominal phlegm accumulations, refusal to nurse, vomiting upon feeding, food epilepsy, alternating chills and fever. This formula treats all such conditions, and though it induces purgation, it does not debilitate.

*Daizheshi* (hematite) and *chishizhi* (halloysite) – each one *liang*; fifty *daxingren* (apricot kernels), peeled and tips removed; thirty *badou* (croton seeds), shelled, pounded in thick paper to remove oil. Optionally add *qingmengshi* (chlorite schist), one *qian* in weight, ground separately and blended in.

Grind the first two ingredients into powder, then separately grind the *badou* and *xingren* into a paste. Combine and pound together one to two thousand times until thoroughly blended. If too stiff, add a small amount of refined honey and pound again. Store in a sealed vessel.

For a thirty-day-old infant, administer a pill the size of a sesame seed with a small amount of breast milk. After a short while, give another dose, but do not allow excessive nursing. By midday, mild purgation should occur, and the fever will resolve. If not fully resolved, administer another pill the following day. For a hundred-day-old infant, use a pill the size of a small soybean, adjusting the dose accordingly.

Infants are born with underdeveloped bones, sinews, organs, and spirit, their *qi* and blood deficient and superficial, their skin tender. Nourished by milk, they gradually grow, undergoing *bianzheng* (transformative phases). Every thirty-two days marks one *bian* (transformation), altering their appearance, followed by one *zheng* (steaming), which fosters muscle growth. After ten *bian* and five minor *zheng*, plus four major *zheng*, totaling 576 days, all phases conclude, and the child matures.

During *bianzheng*, mild cases present with body heat, slight fright, cold ears and coccyx, white blisters on the upper lip resembling fish eyes, and intermittent sweating. Severe cases exhibit high fever, disordered pulse, sweating or its absence, refusal to nurse, vomiting upon feeding, pale whites of the eyes with slight redness, and a faintly white iris—though vision clears after *bianzheng* concludes. These symptoms arise from the circulation of *qi* and blood and the filling of the flesh. No other treatment is needed; administer a small dose of the Purple Pill to induce mild purgation, and the fever will recede. If, after two purgations, the body remains warm with hot ears and coccyx, the condition is unrelated to *bianzheng* and requires separate treatment.

**Baoying Peach-Red Powder** may also be prepared as pills using water-cooked flour paste, the size of longan fruit. For use, dissolve in the appropriate decoction. If swallowed whole, form pills the size of mung beans and administer fifteen per dose.

**Volume Four of Emergency Immortal Remedies**
**Section on Women’s Well-Being**

The medical classics state: *Xiangfuzi* (nutgrass) is the immortal remedy for women, commonly used to guide blood and regulate *qi*. Paired with *wu yao* (lindera), it ensures yang does not become excessive nor yin deficient.

From girlhood to womanhood, since birth, though daily endowed with constitution, women are gatherings of yin, with blood as their foundation. The causes of illness invariably begin with *qi* being stirred, after which blood and *qi* contend, coalescing into grave maladies.

Blood, inherently yin, is soft and yielding by nature, easily afflicted. When exposed to heat, blood overflows; when struck by cold, blood congeals. Overwork disrupts blood’s regular channels; erratic joy and anger cause blood to stagnate and *qi* to accumulate. Unresolved sorrow and thought prevent blood from returning to the collaterals.

Master Chao also said: Blood arises with coolness. In medical treatment, if severity is misjudged or cold and heat misapplied, it may transform into other illnesses, risking harm to life. How can one not be cautious?

The formulas herein, with their warm and balanced natures, derive from the essential teachings of immortals. Neither cooling nor excessive, they harmonize the flow of *ying* and *wei*, suiting all conditions before, during, and after childbirth. Whether young or old, all may attain wholeness of life.

Yet those who use these formulas may doubt the quality of these medicinals, dismissing them as crude or simplistic. Little do they realize these remedies are treasures for women to nurture life and dispel illness. How can one not follow and practice them? The formulas are presented in detail below.

**Marvelous Fragrance Four Spirits Powder** (also called *Four Spirits Decoction*)
Specially regulates menstrual irregularities in women and maidens, as well as all ailments before and after childbirth.

Women are governed by blood and *qi*, yet it is often *qi* that first becomes disordered, leading to blood’s disharmony and the arising of various symptoms. This formula holds profound principles.

- *Xiangfuzi* (nutgrass), hair removed and stir-fried: ½ catty
- *Wu yao* (lindera), stir-fried: 4 *liang*
- *Gancao* (licorice), honey-fried: 1 *liang*

Grind coarsely. For each dose, take 5 *qian* of the mixture, decoct with 1 cup of water, 3 slices of fresh ginger, and 1 jujube until reduced to 70%. Strain and take warm on an empty stomach. Alternatively, decoct with a 3-inch section of scallion.

For treating specific conditions, adjust as follows for immediate efficacy:

- **Menstrual *qi* and blood disharmony, chest and epigastric fullness**: Add *zisu* leaves (perilla) to the decoction.
- **Fright, sorrow, depression, emotional injury, heart fullness, abdominal pain, facial puffiness, and all *qi* disorders**: Add *shichangpu* (acorus) to the decoction.
- **Menstrual irregularity, blood obstruction, nausea, vomiting**: Burn a piece of old ginger until black, cut into five slices, add a pinch of salt, and decoct together.
- **Spleen-stomach cold**: Use as above.
- **Blood stasis, blood dizziness, blood masses, stabbing blood pain**: Decoct as usual, then add a mouthful of good vinegar before taking.
- **Menstruation disrupted by wind, rain, fright, or sorrow, leading to irregular cycles, termed "convulsed vessels," with abdominal tightness, distension, lumbar and leg pain**: Add a pinch of stir-fried *huixiang* (fennel) to the decoction.
- **Menstrual *qi* disharmony, wheezing, fullness, breathlessness, facial and eye puffiness**: Add fresh ginger and *zisu* leaves to the decoction.
- **Spitting blood, coughing up red phlegm, foul throat odor**: Add 3–4 leaves of yellow mulberry (flowering mulberry preferred).
- **Blood stasis, *qi* constipation, dry stool**: Add several slices of *zhiqiao* (bitter orange) or use *qingpi* (green tangerine peel) with the white removed.
- **Blood organ vacuity cold, blood stasis, abdominal pain, long-standing cold in the blood sea, flooding and spotting, red and white vaginal discharge, frequent urination, or errant blood seeping into the large intestine resembling intestinal wind**: Add 1 spoonful of stir-fried *wuzhuyu* (evodia) powder to the decoction, renaming it *Warming the Menses Decoction*.
- **Heat affecting the channels, causing menstrual blood to surge, errant blood flow, termed "heat collapse"**: Add *shengdihuang* (raw rehmannia).
- **Static blood attacking the spleen and stomach, blood choking, *qi* counterflow, or cough with hiccups**: Add 3 slices of fresh ginger and 5 persimmon calyces.
- **Blood-*qi* clouding, heart and abdominal stabbing pain**: Add *liangjiang* (galangal) and *chishaoyao* (red peony), decocting with half water and half wine.
- **Fetal *qi* injured by improper diet, chest and diaphragm oppression, belching with foul food odor, heart and abdominal tightness**: Add *nanmuxiang* (costusroot) or *sousharen* (amomum) to the decoction.
- **Late pregnancy, fetus pressing upward against the heart, termed "fetal suspension"**: Use as usual with ginger slices and *zisu*.
- **Postpartum ailments where blood’s movement is unclear, or vacuity, repletion, cold, and heat are indistinguishable**: First use this formula to harmonize blood and *qi*, avoiding errors, then adjust treatment based on symptoms.
- **Postpartum cold *qi* entering the abdomen, causing hardness and tightness below the navel with stabbing pain, termed "cold mounting"**: Add stir-fried *wuzhuyu* to the decoction.
- **Postpartum uterine prolapse due to excessive straining during delivery (commonly called "organ collapse")**: First use this formula to harmonize *qi* and settle the intestines. Concurrently, fumigate and wash with a decoction of *chushu* (ailanthus) root or branches, scallion, and *huajiao* (Sichuan pepper). The uterus will naturally return to place. This also applies to women with this condition in daily life.

**Black Rhinoceros Horn Pill** regulates the blood vessels, treats wind disorders, and supplements deficiency. It addresses all conditions of the Blood Sea, including blood-wind, blood-cold, blood-stasis, and blood-*qi*. It is suitable for all such cases.

**Horse’s Whinny Liver** (i.e., late silkworm droppings; those collected in the fifth month are best) is selected when cold, stir-fried until smoke rises, and used in the amount of half a catty. **Large Aconite** (two taels in weight) is cracked in hot ash, then removed and beaten in a cloth bag to remove the skin and tip.

The two ingredients are ground into fine powder, boiled with sour vinegar into a paste, and formed into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Thirty pills are taken per dose. For regular use, they may be swallowed with mild vinegar decoction or warm wine. For specific conditions, follow the instructions below.

- **For blood-*qi* disharmony, irregular menstruation, delayed or excessive flow**: Swallow with mild vinegar decoction or warm wine.
- **For blood weakness, yin deficiency, menstrual cessation, emaciation, sallow complexion, persistent lumbar and abdominal pain, or cramping of the legs and knees**: Swallow with wine in which black soybeans have been stir-fried and steeped. Prolonged use will naturally restore menstrual flow.
- **For long-standing blood stasis, lumbar heaviness, and pain with prolonged amenorrhea**: Swallow with wine steeped with *tuniuxi* root. The meridians will recover, and menstruation will resume.
- **For women under fifty with premature cessation of menses, lumbar and spinal heaviness, numbness in the legs and feet, or frequent dimness of vision**: Take regularly with tea or wine.

- **For blood-wind causing tendon spasms, leg swelling and pain, or frequent calf cramps**: Swallow with a *mugua* decoction, or wine steeped with *danggui*, *mugua*, and *niuxi*, or wine steeped with stir-fried black soybeans and *qianghuo*. Concurrently, fumigate and wash with a decoction of finely chopped red knotweed stems and leaves.
- **For blood stasis causing lumbar swelling and pain, or heaviness in the knees (due to stasis in the Foot Greater Yang meridian)**: First chew a pinch of fennel, then swallow with warm wine, or take with wine steeped with stir-fried black soybeans (even better).
- **For blood-wind causing localized heaviness, numbness, and aching in the limbs**: Swallow with wine in which fresh ginger has been stir-fried.
- **For blood deficiency and blood-wind attacking upward, causing loose teeth, gum swelling, blood-wind headaches, migraines, tinnitus, deafness, generalized sores, numbness, dryness, and itching**: Take with *jingjie* spikes or leaves, or with fresh scallion tea, before or after meals.
- **For liver deficiency generating wind, causing excessive cold tears or frequent dimness of vision**: Swallow with a *muze* decoction or a black soybean decoction, at any time.

**Cattail Pollen and Black Spirit Powder** regulates and treats wind-deficiency and consumptive cold in young women and women, all blood-*qi* disorders, blood stasis and dizziness during pregnancy or postpartum, retained lochia, and illnesses caused by static blood. It is suitable for all such cases.

After childbirth, first administer **Black Gold Powder** to suppress blood dizziness and expel static blood. On the second day, take this formula regularly to expel static blood, settle new blood, and naturally prevent all illnesses. This formula is consistently effective, with a hundred successes in a hundred trials.

To regulate women’s various conditions, refine honey into a preparation, weighing one tael and three *qian* per dose, divided into ten pills. Alternatively, use wine-cooked wheat paste to form pills the size of firmiana seeds, taking thirty to fifty pills per dose. Follow the appropriate decoction instructions for each condition. This formula is variously named: **Yin-Nourishing Elixir**, **True-Unblocking Pill**, **Superior Gold Elixir**, **Golden Hairpin Decoction**, **Life-Preserving Pill**, or **Fourfold Center-Regulating Pill**.

**Ingredients**:
- Black soybeans, one *sheng*, stir-fried and husked
- *Xiangfuzi* powder, four taels
- Roasted dried ginger
- Dried *dihuang*, each one tael

Grind into powder. Take two *qian* per dose before meals, mixed with warm wine. Alternatively, form into pills the size of firmiana seeds with wine-cooked wheat paste, taking thirty pills per dose with warm wine or rice water.

- **For postpartum static blood failing to disperse, causing hardness and pain in the child’s pillow (uterine mass)**: Swallow with boy’s urine.
- **For stillbirth or retained dead fetus**: Steep one *ge* of black soybeans in vinegar until soft, then mix with seven *fen* of the powder in a small cup and take warm. The fetus will descend naturally.
- **For retained placenta during childbirth**: Decoct with boy’s urine and wine, then take mixed with wine.
- **For postpartum retained lochia, blood dizziness attacking the heart, dim vision, blackouts, fainting, lockjaw, or loss of consciousness**: Take mixed with warm wine. For more severe cases, take with wine in which a scale weight has been quenched.

The aforementioned *Hei Shen San* (Black Spirit Powder) may be blended with refined honey and formed into pills the size of *wutong* seeds, named *Si Shun Li Zhong Wan* (Fourfold Harmonizing Center-Regulating Pills). For women in the first five *la* (postpartum periods) who are emaciated and weak from exposure, short of breath, and prone to spontaneous sweating, swallow thirty pills with rice water on an empty stomach.

If made into honeyed pills the size of a bullet, it is called *Bao Sheng Wan* (Life-Preserving Pills) for use during pregnancy. It regulates women at the onset of conception when the fetal *qi* is unsettled, causing excessive lying down, reduced activity, and loss of appetite—known as *e zu* (pernicious vomiting). Take one pill, chewed finely, with a decoction of *zhu gen* (ramie root) and glutinous rice, or with a decoction of *qin jiao* (large-leaf gentian) and glutinous rice.

For incessant leaking fetal blood, or discharge of yellow or reddish fluid with heavy pain in the waist and abdomen, swallow with warm wine, and combine with *Jiao Ai Tang* (Ass-Hide Gelatin and Mugwort Decoction), *Ai Tang* (Mugwort Decoction), *Liu Wu Tang* (Six-Ingredient Decoction), or *An Tai Yin* (Fetus-Calming Drink).

For early-stage fetal *qi* congestion causing vexation, fullness, retching, phlegm-drool, and aversion to food with abdominal distension, take with a decoction of fresh bamboo shavings and tangerine peel, and combine with *Fu Ling Ban Xia Tang* (Poria and Pinellia Decoction) or *Er Chen Tang* (Two-Cured Decoction).

For fetal bleeding due to sexual exertion—termed *shang tai* (injured fetus)—take with warm wine.

For women prone to repeated miscarriages or habitual half-term leakage, take with warm wine to harmonize *qi* and contain blood, naturally stabilizing the fetus.

For premature labor-like symptoms before term, take with a decoction of true *zhi mu* (anemarrhena).

For fetal pressure against the heart with the fetus failing to descend, take with a decoction of *chuan xiong* (Sichuan lovage).

For regular use during the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy to nourish the fetus, enrich blood, harmonize the child’s palace, and facilitate delivery, take with a decoction of *zhi ke* (ripe bitter orange) and glutinous rice, or with glutinous rice water alone.

For postpartum use, it is called *Sheng Jin Dan* (Victorious Gold Elixir), treating all postpartum ailments; take with warm wine or rice water.

For supplementing blood deficiency, blood taxation, blood-*qi*, and blood-wind disorders, it is named *Yi Yin Dan* (Yin-Enriching Elixir); take with warm wine or rice water.

For women with cold blood, pale complexion, and visible greenish veins, wine is effective.

For regulating menstruation and nourishing young girls, it is called *Jin Chai Jian* (Golden Hairpin Decoction). For all cases of irregular menstruation, turbid menses, frequent abdominal stabbing pain, or in young girls with weak blood and yin deficiency causing uneven menstrual flow, take as above with wine or water.

Some young girls may menstruate once or twice, then cease for one or two years, or have menses only once per season or every three to five months. This stems from inherently delicate blood vessels that are not yet full, causing intermittent flow. This medicine should be used to regulate *qi* and moisten blood; when blood flourishes, it will flow naturally. Do not attack it, lest it form blood masses or accumulations, leading to blood taxation, consumptive *qi*, and eventually bone-steaming consumption. Combine with *Chen Xiang Sheng Jin Dan* (Aquilaria Victorious Gold Elixir) and *Zi Xue Tang* (Blood-Nourishing Decoction) from *Bai Yi Fang* (Hundred and One Remedies).

For women’s miscellaneous seasonal illnesses, use *Da Sheng Tong Zhen Wan* (Great Sage Penetrating Truth Pills).

For all cases of wind-stroke with lockjaw, opisthotonos, and flaccid or dragging limbs, take with wine in which *qiang huo* (notopterygium) and black soybeans have been stir-fried, and combine with *Xiao Xu Ming Tang* (Minor Life-Prolonging Decoction) or *Wu Jing Wan* (Five Thistle Pills).

For women with five-colored uterine leakage, blood deficiency with cold *qi*, pale or greenish-white complexion, or within one hundred days postpartum, regular use dispels static blood, generates new blood, supplements *qi*, and replenishes deficiency, harmonizing the thoroughfare and conception vessels to prevent all illnesses. Take with warm wine or rice water.

The *Pu Huang Hei Shen San* (Cattail Pollen Black Spirit Powder) contains myriad ingredients that appear mild and unremarkable yet possess subtle principles, differing from conventional methods. For instance, during pregnancy, when essence has just united and *qi* has just congealed, the *Nei Jing* states: "Secret methods nurture the fetal source; slight exposure to cold or heat may cause damage or miscarriage." Thus, it warns that cold causes pain, while heat causes fright, and harsh or excessive decoctions must not be used recklessly. Anger harms fetal *qi*, and after childbirth, the hundred joints open, excessive blood loss depletes fluids, yin and yang are both deficient, and the viscera are weakened. Even minor afflictions may become critical, for as the *Nei Jing* says, "A trifling offense at the right time is as grave as Mount Song." Thus, freezing-cold or harshly drying medicines must be strictly avoided to prevent generating other illnesses. Even for wind-cold or heat-affliction illnesses, harmonizing and symptom-specific regulation are key. For extreme cold or deficiency-cold conditions, use mildly warming medicines first, gradually increasing to stronger warming medicines for regulation. Never act carelessly. Following these principles ensures safety in all pre- and postpartum cases. Do not seek immediate relief by recklessly administering decoctions, lest harm result—such consequences are not trivial. Take heed.

*Da Dang Gui Tang* (Major Chinese Angelica Decoction) treats labor with contractions but obstructed delivery, ruptured membranes, and stagnant blood passage, lasting one or two days. This often results from premature alarm or hasty use of labor-inducing medicines. First, pacify and regulate the mother with frequent doses of this decoction to ensure safety.

**Ingredients:**
- *Chuan dang gui* (Sichuan Chinese angelica) ½ *liang*
- *Di huang* (rehmannia) ½ *liang*
- *Chuan xiong* (Sichuan lovage) ½ *liang*
- *Bai fu ling* (white poria) ½ *liang*
- *Gan cao* (licorice) ½ *liang*
- *Chi shao yao* (red peony) ½ *liang*
- *Shu zhi ke* (ripe bitter orange) ½ *liang*
- *Gui xin* (cinnamon bark) 2 *qian* and a half

**Dosage:** For each dose, take 3 *qian*, decoct in 1 cup of water to 70% remaining, add a pinch of *ru xiang* (frankincense) powder, boil once, and take warm at any time.

If the child has been delivered but the placenta has not yet come, cut the umbilical cord, strike it with an object, and administer *Hei Shen San* (Black Spirit Powder) along with *Duo Ming Dan* (Life-Snatching Elixir) and this decoction. If the abdomen remains full after delivery, take *Xiao Hei Shen San* (Minor Black Spirit Powder), and harmonize stomach *qi* with vinegar-charcoal. Do not let congee or food be lacking. If the mother can drink, give a little wine (but not too much), or *ru xiang tang* (frankincense decoction).

**Tuozhu Dan (Propelling Pearl Elixir)** treats difficult labor. One must first confirm it is true labor—when the waist and abdomen ache unbearably—before administering this remedy. Taking just one or two pills will naturally ease delivery without worry. However, this medicine should not be taken lightly beforehand, for only then can its efficacy be assured.

- *Che qian zi* (plantain seed) 4 *liang*: Rinse, lightly stir-fry, grind, and sift into powder
- *Tu si zi* (dodder seed) 4 *liang*: Rinse, steam with wine, dry, and grind into powder

On the seventh day of the corresponding lunar month, choose a clear, auspicious day. Use *ya suan* (common wood sorrel, colloquially called "granny’s sour grass"), pound to extract a small amount of natural juice, add vinegar, and mix with fried flour paste to form pills the size of a chicken’s egg. Coat with *chen sha* (cinnabar) and dry in the shade. For each dose, take half a pill or one pill, grind with fresh *ya suan* leaves to extract natural juice, and dissolve in boiling vinegar decoction.

**Ruxiang Tang (Frankincense Decoction):** Use pure, translucent *di ru* (frankincense) in any amount, ground into powder. At the first sign of labor pains in the waist or abdomen, take this immediately—one *bi* (spoonful) or half a cup steeped in boiling water. If labor is delayed, it may be due to sitting too early, leading to complications; this decoction is also suitable. Those who tolerate alcohol may take it with wine. It unblocks the meridians, dispels stagnation, relieves pain, and greatly benefits the mother. However, do not overuse it, lest it weaken the child’s bones.

**Primary Remedy for Difficult Labor:**
- *Jin bo* (gold leaf) 3 pieces
- *Tu hao bi tou* (rabbit-hair brush tips) 3, burned to ash

Grind into powder and form into pills with yellow beeswax, the size of *wu tong zi* (firmiana seeds). Take one dose with wine. If labor still does not progress after a day, use *yun mu fen* (mica powder) half a *liang*, refined and ground fine.

**For Undelivered Stillbirth (signs include cyanotic nails and tongue, severe distension, foul breath like excrement):**
First take one dose of *Pingwei San* (Stomach-Calming Powder), divided into two servings. For each, decoct with one cup each of water and wine to reduce to one cup, then add *po xiao* powder and boil three to five times. Strain, allow to cool slightly, and consume entirely. The fetus will dissolve into bloody water and descend.

**Tantai Tang (Fetal Probing Decoction)** determines whether a woman with three months of amenorrhea is pregnant.
- *Chuan xiong* (Sichuan lovage root), ground into powder

Take on an empty stomach with *ai tang* (mugwort decoction). If slight movement is felt, it is a fetus. If movement occurs below the navel or not at all, these are blood disorders; treat promptly with blood-moving medicines.

As the three yin meridians receive dampness, unable to separate.
First regulate and dispel dampness,
Then calm the fetus and treat the foot meridians.

Whenever a woman is seven or eight months pregnant with swollen feet, this is due to fetal qi flowing into the three yin foot meridians. As the due month approaches, menstrual blood becomes excessive, and qi disperses with the blood. First dispel dampness, then administer *Fenqi Decoction*.

Dissolve *Suhexiang* pills in water and take,
And phantom pregnancies or demonic afflictions will not linger.

Whenever a woman carries a child for three or four months,
Her appetite unharmed, her monthly courses unchanged,
This is due to demonic qi or malevolent influences lodged in the viscera,
Filling her abdomen—she should take *Suhexiang* pills with well-water at dawn.

**Sores on the Jade Gate**
When sores arise on the Jade Gate, causing pain and itching,
It stems from bedroom excess depleting her primal essence.
Wash two or three times with scallion water,
Then apply powdered apricot kernels mixed with oil to heal.

It is due to wind invading during menstruation or overindulgence in bedroom affairs—
This is called *yin erosion*.

Burn to ash and mix with clear oil for application.

This pain invariably spreads to one flank.

If it is on the right, it is blood; if on the left, it is qi—
All due to wind-damp invasion, the interplay of worry and strain,
Leading to disharmony of qi and blood.
For qi, take *Qi-Harmonizing Decoction*;
For blood, take *Blood-Harmonizing Decoction*.

- *Tianxianteng* (marsh pepper)

In equal parts, grind into powder and take with warm wine.

**Shivering**
When the body shivers as if possessed by spirits,
It is truly a sign of blood-cold—nothing else.
Simply trust in the efficacy of *Zigui* pills,
Mixed with hot wine, a small dose will suffice.

Whenever a woman shivers,
It is due to blood-cold—
All from wind-cold damage, weak qi and blood,
Thus causing the shivering.

**Zigui Pills**
- *Jingjie* (schizonepeta)
- *Mudanpi* (moutan)
- *Gui* (cinnamon)
- *Baishaoyao* (white peony)

Grind the above into powder and take with hot wine.

**Heartburn**
Heartburn arises from long-standing cold in the spleen,
Phlegm accumulation in the stomach causes sourness within.
*Chenpi* (tangerine peel) and *maiya* (malt) dispel stagnation,
*Cangzhu* (atractylodes) and *zhuyu* (evodia) restore health day by day.

Whenever a woman suffers from phlegm-fluid retention,
Lodged between spleen and stomach, she often experiences heartburn or watery vomit.

**Zhuyu Pills**
- *Wuzhuyu* (evodia), washed in saltwater—1 *liang*
- *Cangzhu* (atractylodes)—1 *liang*
- *Chenpi* (tangerine peel), white pith removed—5 *qian*
- *Maiya* (malt)—5 *qian*
- *Gui* (cinnamon)—5 *qian*
- *Shenmian* (wheat flour)—5 *qian*

Boil the flour in water to make a paste, form into pills, and take with rice water.

**Deafness**
Why does deafness strike in the final three decades?
All from reckless blood meeting wind’s attack.
Add *fuzi* (aconite) to *Baji* pills,
And include *nao* (borneol) and *shexiang* (musk) for full restoration.

Whenever a woman’s wind-weakness ascends thus,
Simply take *Baji* pills with added *fuzi*, followed by warm wine.
Also take *Huangqi* Decoction and *Baji* Pills as recorded in the *Formulary*.

**Generalized Numbness**
From deficiency, dampness invades—numbness spreads,
Unfeeling, painless, with eyes that blur and fade.
When qi and blood encounter wind-toxin’s sway,
The Five Tonics dispel wind and restore array.

Whenever a woman’s body grows numb and inert,
Called "lack of benevolence," it stems from blood-wind, blood deficiency, and wind-damp invasion.

**Five Tonics Pills**
- *Huangqi* (astragalus)—1 *liang*
- *Renshen* (ginseng)—5 *qian*
- *Fuzi* (aconite)—1 piece

**Qin Gui Pills (Expanded from an Alternative Text, Proven Effective)**
For treating women without children, formerly known to Jinzhou’s Fan Luoyan, who begged for this formula. He tested it on women, declaring: "If no child results after forty-nine days, let my entire household be punished. How could Heaven’s virtue be so easily altered?"

Though his words seem boastful, the results are truly extraordinary. My wife, at twenty-seven and childless, conceived after twenty days of taking this medicine. The remaining pills were given to the wife of the magistrate of Shimen County, aged thirty-four and barren for sixteen years—she too conceived. They were also given to the wife of Palace Attendant Wen Ji, aged forty and childless—she likewise conceived. Its efficacy is divine, beyond full description; it is indeed an immortal’s formula.

**Preface to the Immortal’s Secret Formula for Treating Injuries and Mending Fractures**

During the Huichang era of the Tang dynasty, a mendicant monk built a thatched hut in Zhong Village of Yichun. His appearance was most venerable, and he was said to be one hundred forty or fifty years of age. He tilled several *mu* of land, growing millet to sustain himself.

In the village lived an old man named Peng, who often visited the monk’s hut and grew quite familiar with him, sometimes even assisting with the plowing. One day, Peng’s son climbed a tree to cut branches and fell to the ground, breaking his neck and dislocating his arm, his groans unceasing. Peng told the monk, who asked to examine the boy. He instructed Peng to purchase several medicinal ingredients, then prepared them himself for the boy to take. Soon the pain subsided, and within days, the boy had recovered as if nothing had happened.

Only then did Peng realize the monk was skilled in medicine, and those seeking his help grew ever more numerous. The monk, weary of the demands, took out a formula and taught it to Peng, charging him to prepare it for those in need. He made Peng swear not to profit carelessly, not to sell it cheaply, and not to transmit it to the unworthy.

From then on, those who spoke of treating injuries followed the methods of Master Peng. When Peng first met the monk, he was only thirty or so, yet now he had grown old, though his bearing remained unchanged. When asked his name, the monk replied, “I am the Orchid Daoist.” When asked his origin, he said, “I am from Chang’an.”

At first, the monk kept his door closed and avoided society, and few came to visit. Only a certain Master Deng would visit in spring’s hidden warmth and autumn’s crisp clarity, bringing his young son and always arriving with wine. The monk hung a coconut gourd on the wall, and when Deng arrived, he would take it down to pour wine. If Peng happened to be there, he too would drink. The two would talk and laugh until dusk, and when drunk, they would sing loudly. Their song went:

*Worldly learning, worldly learning—mastered yet useless,*
*Mountain joy, mountain joy—land fit for plowing and hewing.*
*With a gourd of wine, let us drink together.*
*Drunk, I lie in the thatched hut—who would rouse me?*
*Suddenly, beneath the pines, I hear a pair of cranes calling.*
*Rising, I see the sun piercing the forest’s edge.*

Peng, simple and unlearned, did not understand the meaning of the words, but he listened often to the song and learned its tune. When he returned home, he would sing it to others, though none grasped its import.

After some time, Master Deng no longer came. Peng asked the monk about him, and the monk replied, “He has departed as an immortal.” Peng did not comprehend, but later, when the Jiangxi provincial inspector passed through Yuanzhou on an official tour, he heard Peng singing and found the words strange. Upon inquiring, he learned the monk’s name and sent men with Peng to the hut to invite him. By then, the monk had already departed, leaving only the gourd behind. The inspector deeply regretted this and, having heard of Peng’s transmission of the monk’s formulas for treating injuries, renamed the village *Gong*. The monk had written several scrolls, but what he taught was only the final volume.

**Oral Instructions on the Sequence of Medical Treatment for Setting and Mending**

1. Rinse with boiled water.
2. Assess the site of injury.
3. Apply traction.
4. If necessary, use force to realign the bone.
5. Press into place.
6. Apply *Black Dragon Powder* to promote circulation.
7. Fill the wound with *Wind-Flow Powder*.
8. Bind with splints.
9. Administer internal medicine.
10. Rinse again.
11. Reapply *Black Dragon Powder* to promote circulation.
12. If needed, refill the wound with *Wind-Flow Powder*.
13. Rebind with splints.
14. Continue with the previous internal medicine.

For fractures of the skull:
- Gently press with the hands to flatten and align.
- If the skin is unbroken, apply *Black Dragon Powder* as a poultice.
- If broken, fill the wound with *Wind-Flow Powder* and wrap with silk, avoiding exposure to wind or water to prevent *tetanic wind*.
- If wind or water enters the brain, causing *tetanic wind*, the patient will develop headaches and become incurable.
- For injuries within the hairline, trim the hair before applying medicine.

Fractures of the skull can be treated if they are on the cranial bones. If at the temples—where life resides—treatment is absolutely impossible.

For dislocated shoulder blades:
- Assess how to realign, then place a chair back against the ribs.
- Have one person hold the patient steady while two others apply traction, then lower the arm.
- Bend the wrist and bind with silk.

For the *Golden Well Bone* (below the ribs):
- If injured, do not bind with splints. Simply press flat to restore alignment, apply *Black Dragon Powder*, and bind with silk.
- The same applies to the ribs.

For dislocated hip bones:
- If displaced upward from the buttocks, have two or three people hold the leg steady and apply traction before repositioning with the foot.
- If displaced inward from the groin, realignment is impossible.

For dislocated arm bones:
- Observe the direction of displacement. If the bone is out to the left, pull it back to the right; if out to the right, pull it back to the left.

All bones in the limbs have two shafts. If one is broken, treatment is possible; if both are broken, recovery is impossible.

Severe fractures of the limbs cannot be treated.

For serious injuries, the general principle is to apply traction, press into place, or open and realign before applying poultices, filling wounds, binding with splints, or further traction. Traction should be applied near the site of the fracture, not at a distant joint.

When applying traction, assess whether the bone is displaced left or right, and whether straight or oblique traction is needed.

To identify the injury, simply palpate whether the bone is aligned. For left or right displacements, carefully examine the bone seams, gently pressing and assessing to determine the general condition.

The goal is to restore the bone to its original position and press the skin to meet the bone.

Traction may require one, two, or three people, depending on the difficulty.

If the skin is broken and the bone protrudes, yet traction fails to realign it, press the bone close and, if off by a fraction, use a sharp knife to make a small incision and guide the bone back. Do not cut the flesh—the flesh will naturally decay and allow the bone to reenter.

Once the bone is back in place, apply *Black Dragon Powder* around the swollen area of the wound, leaving the wound open. Fill the wound separately with *Wind-Flow Powder*. The knife must be extremely sharp; a carving or engraving knife will suffice.

When realigning, frequently rotate and mobilize the area to keep it supple.

For fractured bones, assess whether the site is level and even—generally, a depressed bone indicates no damage, while asymmetry suggests the fracture site. Apply traction and realignment, then apply medicinal powder and secure with splints, ensuring the bone is perfectly level.

Swelling arises from blood stagnation; soak and wash with hot medicinal water, then apply *Black Dragon Powder*.

For severe injuries, always soak and wash with medicinal water before applying medicine. For minor injuries, medicine may be applied directly without washing.

Splinting should be loosened every two to three days in summer, or every three to five days in winter. Soak the splinted area in hot medicinal water to remove old medicine, taking care not to disturb the injury. Then reapply *Black Dragon Powder* and re-splint—this applies only to severe injuries.

For open wounds, fill with *Wind-Flow Powder* and apply topically. For unbroken skin, apply *Black Dragon Powder* and secure with fir-wood splints.

When applying traction and realignment, use soft materials such as silk cloth as padding.

If fragments of bone are embedded beneath the skin, apply *Black Dragon Powder* only; the flesh will naturally necrose, allowing the fragments to emerge before healing occurs.

For compound fractures or tendon ruptures with open wounds, fill with *Wind-Flow Powder*, then suture the skin with a needle and thread. Apply *Black Dragon Powder* around the wound’s perimeter.

For splinting, use several strips of fir bark, binding them tightly around the injury, leaving a single gap. Secure the splint in three layers, ensuring each is tightly bound.

For flat areas where the bone is fractured but the skin remains intact, apply medicine and secure with a snug splint.

Generally, avoid splinting curved or concave areas such as joints or the arch of the foot, as this may impede later extension. Instead, apply *Black Dragon Powder* and wrap with cloth to allow for flexion and movement.

For multiple fractures, such as in the fingers, use ramie fiber for splinting. For the thigh, use ramie cord, roughly the thickness of twine.

When applying medicine, use a flat board covered with oiled or plain paper. Mix *Black Dragon Powder* with water, spread it evenly, then roll and apply to the injury.

For fir-bark splints, soak strips about the width of a finger, arrange them loosely around the injury, and bind tightly with thin cord in three layers. Reapply every three days: soak, wash, and replace the medicine as before.

For curved areas such as the wrist, ankle, or fingers, ensure mobility. After applying medicine and wrapping with silk, frequently move the joint. Flexion and extension must alternate regularly to prevent stiffness.

In the initial stages of injury, numbness may mask pain. Even when traction, realignment, or incisions are applied, no pain may be felt—discomfort typically arises after two or three days.

Injuries may still be treated within a month; beyond that, correction becomes difficult.

Avoid consuming herbal decoctions, as they may prevent proper bone healing.

For internal bruising from falls, first administer blood-dispersing medicine, such as *Four Agents Decoction*.

If urination or defecation is obstructed after injury, do not immediately administer trauma medicine, as such formulas are warming and require wine. First, use *Four Agents Decoction*, then assess. If obstruction persists, add *Magnolia Bark* and *Mirabilite* to *Great Achievement Decoction*. Only after normal elimination resumes should trauma medicine be given.

For severe injuries, administer qi-regulating medicine, such as *Qi-Harmonizing Powder*, before trauma medicine.

For unexplained generalized pain, treat as wind-induced injury with wind-dispersing medicine, such as *Wind-Dispelling Decoction*.

When taking trauma medicine, avoid cold foods—fish and beef are particularly cooling and should not be consumed. Beef, in particular, may cause intractable pain.

Trauma medicine must be warming to generate blood and qi, thereby promoting bone knitting.

Medicine may be taken with red wine, unfiltered wine, or fresh wine.

Medicine prepared in the third or fourth month should not be made in large quantities; the fifth month is especially unsuitable. Store powdered medicine and prepare pills as needed.

Store pills and powders in jars within a warm cabinet, drying them over fire.

Never use moxibustion on injuries, as it renders medicine ineffective and prevents healing.

Among all medicines, *Small Red Pills* and *Great Blood-Activating Elixir* are most valuable, as they contain frankincense and myrrh. *Maple Resin* may substitute for one-third of the frankincense. *Dragon’s Blood* is difficult to obtain; its absence in *Great Blood-Activating Elixir* is acceptable, though its presence improves efficacy. Trauma medicine must never lack frankincense or myrrh. If myrrh is unavailable, substitute with *Foreign Lignum Vitae*. If *Dragon’s Blood* is absent, the same substitute may be used.

The origin of medicinal ingredients varies. For example, *Chinese Angelica* differs between local and Sichuan varieties. Pills may use local *Chinese Angelica*, but powdered medicine requires the non-local variety.

For severe injuries, prepare the following decoction for washing before applying medicine:
Cut fresh scallions into sections, and combine with fresh ginger and *Schizonepeta* (chopped), along with local *Chinese Angelica*. Boil into a warm decoction for soaking and washing.

*Black Dragon Powder* is used for treating falls, fractures, and dislocations. First, boil scallion decoction or medicinal liquid for washing, then apply traction and manipulation to realign the bone. Afterward, mix fresh ginger juice or rehmannia juice with water, and spread thinly on prepared silk or paper, applying it to the injury. Next, use fir-bark strips, roughly finger-width, arranged loosely around the injury, and bind tightly with thin cord in three layers. Reapply every three days: soak, wash, replace medicine, and rewrap.

The splint must not be removed and requires protection. Do not allow movement; only when the bone has firmly regrown may the splint be removed, after which recovery will proceed as before. For wounds from blades or arrows, or injuries from insects or beasts that fester and ulcerate; for flesh that fails to regenerate, or bruises and swelling from falls and knocks—apply a poultice mixed with ginger juice and water. If the skin is broken, leave an opening and fill with *Wind-Flow Powder*.

**Ingredients:**
- *Chuan Shan Jia* (pangolin scales), six liang: stir-fried until yellow or charred to preserve its nature
- *Ding Xiang Pi* (clove bark), six liang
- *Pi Pa Ye Gen* (loquat leaf and root, hairs removed), half a liang (some say *Shan Pi Pa Gen*)
- *Tu Dang Gui* (local *Chinese Angelica*), two liang
- *Bai Cao Shuang* (soot from burned grasses, for dispersing blood), half a liang

Dry-fry the ingredients, then grind into a fine powder. Mix with ginger juice or rehmannia juice for application.

**Great Blood-Quickening Elixir** treats traumatic injuries, fractures, broken bones, torn sinews, pain and swelling, stagnant blood in the abdomen that spreads to the limbs causing restlessness and fullness; carbuncles, deep abscesses, necrotic flesh, various wind disorders, hemiplegia, numbness in the hands and feet; women’s blood-wind ailments, postpartum blood stasis that fails to circulate and flows into the limbs causing facial swelling, blood and qi pain, generalized aches and numbness, turbid menstrual flow, wind-fatigue flare-ups, and aching joints. Take half a pill each time, ground in unhusked wine, gently simmered three to five times, and taken warm without regard to timing or quantity. Store this medicine in a gauze bag in a clean place; it will keep indefinitely and may be used in emergencies. Pregnant women must not take it. For injuries above the waist, take after meals; for injuries below, take on an empty stomach. Severe injuries may be treated without regard to timing; other cases follow this principle.

Grind the mulberry, chestnut, soybean, *Gu Sui Bu*, *Tian Nan Xing*, and *Shao Yao* into powder, then mix with the remaining ingredients and grind finely. Cook glutinous rice paste with rice vinegar, mix with the powder, and pound a thousand times with pestles. Gather helpers to roll the pills quickly; if delayed, the mixture will separate. Dry in the shade for half a month, then dry over fire or in the sun for a day. Large pills weigh six *wen* when wet, medium pills three *wen*. Once dry, coat hands with lacquer, take two or three pills, and roll them in lacquer to form a shell. Take half a pill each time. When preparing this medicine, ensure it is not seen by those with double pupils, and avoid chickens, dogs, and women—if seen, the medicine will fail.

**Small Red Pills** treat fractures, open wounds with exposed bone, shattered limbs, necrotic flesh, unbearable pain with day-and-night cries, cases unresponsive to all treatments, chronic injuries with misaligned sinews and bones that prevent movement, post-injury wind-dampness causing joint contracture and eventual disability, overworked sinews and bones, shoulder and back pain, limb fatigue, and weakness in movement.

**Methods for Treating Boils**

At the onset of a *ding* boil, most people remain unaware. It may arise on the head, face, hands, feet, abdomen, flanks, waist, or legs—no fixed location. Within one or two days, it invariably induces malarial-like chills and fever, headache, and unbearable body pain, its ache distinct from ordinary afflictions. One must thoroughly examine the body to identify the sore. If a small sore appears, differing slightly from common lesions, it is a *ding* boil.

These boils arise from various causes, and their forms likewise differ:
- **Pig boil**: Round and small, with oil in the sore’s opening.
- **Sheep boil**: Elongated and white.
- **Ox boil**: Round and small, with no oil in the sore’s opening.
- **Dog boil**: Elongated or pointed, red.
- **Donkey/horse boil**: Triangular in shape, with a black dot at the apex and red roots.

Note that these boils are not solely caused by the toxins of pigs, oxen, dogs, sheep, donkeys, or horses. Drinking stagnant, unclean water may produce a **water boil**; consuming tofu contaminated with human sweat may produce a **tofu boil**. There are also **qi boils** and **ghost boils**, whose forms vary, yet their treatment methods remain uniform.

**Slow-progressing sore coloration**:
- Day 1: Sore apex appears slightly white.
- Day 2: Color deepens to white.
- Day 3: Hue turns faint purple.
- Day 4: True purple appears.

**Rapid-progressing sore coloration**:
- Day 5: Faint green, slightly taut.
- Day 6: Deep green, greatly taut.
- Day 7: Black, resembling a fish’s navel or a scald—this is the most critical stage.

**Auspicious signs in boil symptoms**:
If, alongside the primary boil, another small sore appears elsewhere on the body, this is termed "having an echo." Prick it with a needle to protect the surrounding area. If the boil’s periphery reddens and swells, with multiple sores emerging (called "scattered stars"), yet appetite remains normal, with headache, fever, and warm hands and feet, the condition is favorable.

**Ominous signs in boil symptoms**:
If no sore appears elsewhere, failing to protect the area, and the boil’s periphery lacks redness or swelling, the prognosis is poor. For **internal boils**, symptoms include intense thirst, inability to eat, dizziness, blurred vision, inability to rise or move in bed, fixed white of the eye, cyanotic lips and tongue, and severe abdominal pain. **Five-center swelling**, cold hands and feet, coarse breathing, and pulselessness also indicate criticality.

**Peach-Red Powder** treats all *ding* boils. Even if dire symptoms manifest and all six pulses cease, indicating death, this formula can still govern the condition.
*Toad venom*; *arsenic* (small amount); *cicada slough* (feet and wings removed); *blister beetle* (feet and wings removed), 3 each; *centipede head*, 1; *national cinnabar*, 5 qian; *air-slaked lime*, 1 liang (baked in a sand pot with a tile and charcoal for one hour, then removed).

Process each ingredient, grind together into an extremely fine powder, and mix with the mucus from the inner skin of scallion white using a fingernail.

First, pierce the sore’s opening with a *he*-leaf needle to a depth of half an inch. All *ding* boils have red-threaded paths; insert the needle obliquely along these threads. If the sore is above the chest, angle the needle downward; if below, angle upward. Since boil toxins tend toward the heart, needle insertion should follow the toxin’s course. After withdrawing the needle, allow foul blood to drain completely. Then place a grain of toad venom the size of a wheat kernel into the sore’s opening, using the needle to push it deep inside. Apply the scallion-mixed powder to the sore’s opening—avoid healthy flesh. Soak 20–30 layers of paper in cold water, place over the medicine, and seal the sore firmly. If sealed in the early morning, by evening, if the sore feels hot, remove the paper, wash away the residue, and apply **Jade-Red Powder** to the sore’s opening. The sore will fester and ache for several days; continue applying Jade-Red Powder and washing daily with scallion decoction.

Though *ding* boils may appear perilous, pricking the sore, inserting toad venom, and sealing it with Peach-Red Powder can ensure recovery. If the sore festers and pain becomes unbearable, do not worry—this is not the boil’s toxicity harming the body but the toad venom corroding the boil’s toxins, hence the pain. Gather **cotton rose leaves** (mulberry leaves may substitute), grind, and apply around the sore to disperse blood and prevent congestion. Change the medicine day and night, washing the sore before each application. The sore will heal swiftly.

When a *ding* boil first erupts, it invariably causes chills, fever, and body pain—this indicates toxic *qi* at the surface, requiring sweating to resolve. **Naturally Boiling Decoction** governs this.
For the elderly, weak, or pregnant, sweating and purging are inadvisable; use Peach-Red Powder to draw out toxins.

**Naturally Boiling Decoction**
*Alum*, 5 qian; *indigo*, 3 qian; *tomb-side sun-dried lime*, 3 qian.

Grind the above ingredients into a fine powder, ensuring no grit remains, then blend thoroughly. For each dose, take three *qian*, mix with half a bowl of well-flower water, and stir vigorously with a willow twig a hundred times until even. Drink in one draught. Cover with thick clothing for a good while, then take a hot decoction of scallion and fermented soybeans with a little vinegar to reinforce the medicine’s power, inducing sweating to resolve the condition.

If the *ding* boil was initially unnoticed and no sweating was induced by the previous method, after several days the chills, fever, and body pain will subside, but the toxic *qi* will have turned inward. Purgative medicine must then be used to discharge the internal toxins, for which **Realgar Pill** governs.

**Realgar Pill**
*Realgar* and *curcuma* (tumeric), 5 *qian* each; *croton seed*, half a *qian* (remove kernels and shells, lightly defat).
One formula adds a pinch of *arsenic* (no more), boiled in clear oil for half a day, then dried and added to the medicine.
Another adds seven *blister beetles* (remove wings and feet, stir-fry with glutinous rice until discolored, discard the rice).
Yet another adds 3 *qian* of *refined mirabilite* to treat swollen and painful throat, throat blockage, and similar conditions.

Grind each into a fine powder, form into pills with wheat-flour paste the size of mung beans. Take seven pills with cold tea, adjusting the dose to induce bowel movement. If no movement occurs, take again.

**Jade-Red Powder**
*Calcitum* (calcined), 1 *liang*; *calomel* and *minium*, a small amount each.
Grind into a fine powder and sprinkle on the sore, washing and reapplying twice day and night.

Since toad venom ointment and Peach-Red Powder are both potent medicines, they cause sore pain. Jade-Red Powder neutralizes their toxicity, while the two medicines disperse blood—thus the sore will naturally heal.

If the above toad venom, Peach-Red Powder, or similar medicines cannot be immediately identified, Li Shi’an’s unified treatment method may be used, with even swifter efficacy.

**Li Shi’an’s Treatment Method**
**Chinese Angelica Powder**
*Chinese angelica tail*, 2 *liang*; *Sichuan lovage*, *dried kudzu*, *schizonepeta spike*, *lindera*, *angelica*, *Sichuan angelica*, *red peony*, *cimicifuga*, 1 *liang* each; *notopterygium*, *licorice*, *siler* (remove nodes), *bitter orange*, half a *liang* each; *safflower* and *sappan wood*, 2.5 *qian* each.
For sore pain, add 5 *qian* each of *frankincense*, *myrrh*, and *angelica*.
For persistent fever, add a small amount of *bamboo shavings* and *gardenia*.
For constipation, add 1 *liang* of *bitter orange*.
For restlessness, add ten *rush piths* and one piece of *bamboo shavings*.
For thirst, add 1 *liang* of *trichosanthes root*.
For swelling, add half a *liang* each of *licorice node* and *dalbergia node*.
For dizziness, add *Sichuan lovage*, *angelica*, *schizonepeta*, and *siler*.
For thirst with urinary blockage, add 1 *liang* of *talcum*.

Crush the ingredients, take 5 *qian* per dose, decoct with ten-odd *rush piths* and ten black soybeans in one and a half cups of water until reduced to eight parts. For upper-body sores, take after meals; for lower-body sores, take before meals. Administer repeatedly for efficacy.

If a *ding* boil goes unnoticed at first and no sweating is induced by the previous method, after several days the external symptoms will subside, but swelling may arise in the abdomen, flanks, chest, or armpits—this indicates the toxic *qi* has turned inward, requiring **Thunderbolt Fire** treatment.

If external symptoms persist after taking Chinese Angelica Powder, apply Thunderbolt Fire without delay.

**Thunderbolt Fire Method**
Heat a goose-egg-sized cobblestone until red-hot. Place a bamboo chair inside a large tub, with a ladle beneath the chair. Have the patient sit naked on the chair. Mix *schizonepeta* powder with sour rice vinegar in a vessel, then place the red-hot stone in the ladle and pour the *schizonepeta*-vinegar mixture over it. Avoid excessive heat to prevent scalding. If the fire weakens before sweating occurs, add more heat and pour again. Cover the tub’s opening with a quilt, and drape another over the patient’s head, leaving only the mouth and nose exposed. Ensure sweat emerges over the entire body, including the head and face—then the illness will resolve. This method is exceptionally effective.

For the elderly, weak, or pregnant—who should not undergo sweating or purging—pierce the sore, apply **Sea Horse Toxin-Drawing Powder** to the wound, and administer a wine-decocted *xanthium* drink.

If the toxin has turned inward and Thunderbolt Fire is used, the patient need not enter the tub. Instead, use a small bucket: place the ladle with the red-hot stone inside, pour vinegar over it, and have the patient lean over the bucket, covering the swollen area. Seal with quilts to prevent steam from escaping. After a while, sweat will emerge from the swollen area. If sweating is insufficient, add more heat and pour again, ensuring the swollen area sweats thoroughly—full-body sweating is unnecessary.

If the sore is between the flanks and the toxin threatens to rush toward the heart, this is a critical condition. Immediately apply three to five moxa cones to the sore’s tip, then bleed slightly before and after the moxa site. Blisters forming around the moxa wound are auspicious; their absence is ominous.

For sores in soft or inaccessible areas where needling or moxibustion is impractical, use the **Pine Needle Cutting Method** to sever the red-thread path. If the sore is between the hips and the toxin threatens the kidneys, use pine needles to sever the red-thread path at its terminus in the hips, drawing blood. For sores on the head or face, sever the thread path at the nape or wherever it terminates, drawing blood. If the red-thread path is not visible, infer its course and use pine needles to sever it.

The Pine Needle Method is employed when the red-thread path is invisible and no clear point of intervention exists. Apply it to soft areas beneath the jaw, armpits, or hips to sever the toxic *qi* and prevent it from attacking the heart or kidneys.

**Pine Needle Method**

Select the hardest needles from the north-facing branches of a pine tree, bundle them tightly together, and align them evenly. Carefully determine the path of the toxic *qi* and apply the needles to the soft, vulnerable areas, ensuring that blood is drawn. Before needling, moisten the area with wine; the patient may experience slight pain, which they should endure briefly. Administer one or two doses of realgar and musk powder mixed with warm wine before needling.

If the exterior symptoms have resolved but the toxic *qi* has turned inward, use the aforementioned **Realgar Pill** to treat it. If the limbs are cold and the six pulses have all ceased, this indicates that the toxic *qi* has penetrated deeply, overwhelming the *qi* and blood and obstructing their flow—hence the cold body and imperceptible pulse. In such cases, administer the **Wood Fragrance Qi-Flowing Decoction** in several consecutive doses to restore the circulation of *qi* and blood, after which the pulse will naturally return. Then proceed with the appropriate treatment; success is certain.

The **Sea Horse Toxin-Extracting Powder** is highly effective for treating clove sores and also addresses all types of malignant sores and carbuncles on the back. Its ingredients are:
- One sea horse (roasted)
- Two *qian* each of pangolin scales (stir-fried with yellow earth), mercury, and cinnabar
- Three *qian* of realgar
- One *qian* of calomel
- Small amounts of borneol and musk

Grind all ingredients except mercury into powder, then incorporate the mercury and grind until no specks remain. Pierce the sore and apply the powder inside once daily; its efficacy is divine.

The symptoms of internal clove sores resemble those of external hemorrhoids, including chills, fever, headache, and body aches. However, no visible sore appears. After several days, swelling may arise in one area of the chest, back, abdomen, flanks, head, face, hands, or feet—this marks the site of the internal clove sore. Immediately apply the **Thunderbolt Fire** method as before, inducing sweat at the swollen area without protecting the surrounding skin. If the body experiences chills and fever, even without swelling, but severe abdominal pain is present, treat it as an internal clove sore using the following method without delay.

Place one **toad venom** pellet on the patient’s tongue (use two if the condition is severe) and allow it to dissolve. After some time, rinse the mouth with fresh well water, then administer seven **Realgar Pills** with cold tea. Once the bowels move several times, the illness will resolve immediately.

When preparing toad venom for treating internal clove sores, take a mulberry leaf the size of a small coin, mix it with the venom, and knead until well combined. Form the mixture into beads the size of prayer beads and dry them in the shade.

**Emergency Immortal Remedies, Scroll Nine: Secret Transmission on the Five Types of Hemorrhoids**

**Origins of Hemorrhoids**
Hemorrhoids afflict both rich and poor, men and women alike.
Among the wealthy, they arise from excess in wine, lust, wealth, and temper;
among the poor, from bearing heavy burdens, hunger, exposure, and early travel.
In all cases, they stem from the blood of the heart and liver.
Joy injures the heart; anger injures the liver.
When joy and anger are unregulated, wind and blood invade the large intestine,
becoming trapped at the anus with no outlet.
They congeal into masses, causing bleeding and prolapse, each with its own form.
In women, they may follow menstrual chill or wind-induced menstrual disorders,
leaving residual blood in the heart meridian that flows into the large intestine.
In children, they may arise after diarrhea or from heat contracted in the womb.
Treatment methods follow below.

**Water-Settled Paste to Protect Healthy Tissue**
*Grind the following into fine powder:*
- Turmeric (1 tael)
- White clay (1 tael)
*(One formula adds coptis.)*

When internal hemorrhoids prolapse during defecation, wash the area with warm water.
Do not sit; instead, lie on the edge of the bed.
Mix the powder with fresh water and honey to a thin consistency.
Using a small spatula, gently apply the paste to the healthy tissue around the anus,
leaving only the hemorrhoid head exposed.
Cover with a thin paper circle, then brush the paper with warm water
to prevent the paste from scattering.
When the paste dries, remoisten it with warm water.

**Caustic Paste (for Shrinking Hemorrhoids)**
*Grind each separately into fine powder:*
- Good-quality alum (4 taels)
- Raw arsenic (2.5 candareens)
- Cinnabar (1 candareen, raw and finely ground)

First place the arsenic in a Jian ware bowl, then cover with alum powder.
Heat over fire until smoke ceases, allowing the arsenic to vaporize entirely,
leaving only its *qi* infused in the alum.
Grind the alum into an extremely fine powder.
Assess the size of the hemorrhoid head:
place alum powder in the palm, add a pinch of cinnabar,
and mix with saliva to a thin consistency.
Apply to the entire hemorrhoid head with a spatula, three times daily.
Observe closely: when the hemorrhoid turns charred black, the treatment is effective.
By night, yellow fluid will discharge—do not be alarmed, for its complete drainage is ideal.
Apply the paste once more at midnight, then resume three applications the next day.
Mild pain is normal.
When changing the paste, fill a bowl with fresh or warm water,
and gently wash the hemorrhoid with a brush to remove old paste before applying new.
Continue using the protective paste.

**Adjustments to the Caustic Paste**
This paste relies on arsenic’s potency, tempered by cinnabar to mitigate its toxicity.
After two or three days, when the yellow fluid nears exhaustion,
gradually increase the proportion of cinnabar and reduce the alum
to soften the paste’s edge.
Adjustments should be made every two or three days, proceeding gradually to avoid alarming the patient.
The practitioner must observe the hemorrhoid’s color changes
and modulate the thickness of the paste accordingly—this is the key to treatment.

**Schizonepeta Decoction**
*Simmer:*
- Schizonepeta (chopped, 3 bowls of water)

Use the decoction to wash the hemorrhoids.
After washing, return the liquid to a bottle and warm over fire for reuse, three to five times.

**Moistening the Intestines Pill**
*Grind equal parts of the following into powder and form into honey pills:*
- Rhubarb (wrapped in damp paper and roasted, then chopped)
- Bitter orange (peel removed)
- Chinese angelica (honey-processed)

Take 20–30 pills with warm water, adjusting dosage based on the patient’s bowel condition.
*This is administered after the caustic paste has nearly desiccated the hemorrhoid,
when the anus feels constricted and bowel movements may become difficult.
The pill ensures the intestines remain smooth and unobstructed.*

**Dragon-Stone Powder**
*Grind each into an extremely fine powder:*
- Calcined dragon bone (fire toxin removed)
- Dahurian angelica
- High-quality red lead
- Calcined gypsum (fire toxin removed)

Apply this powder after the hemorrhoid head has completely fallen off to promote wound healing.
Prepare *Blood-Coagulating Powder* in advance for emergency use to stop bleeding or close wounds.

**Guide Out the Red Powder**
*Chop and simmer:*
- Rehmannia (2 taels)
- Scutellaria (3 taels)

Take 3 candareens per dose with 1 cup of water, simmered to 60–70%.
Serve warm.
*After applying the caustic paste, if urination becomes dark and difficult,
take this with added talcum, licorice, and rush pith.*

**Double Gold Powder**
*Grind equal parts into an extremely fine powder:*
- Coptis
- Turmeric

Mix with honey water and apply to the hemorrhoid head.
*For weak patients experiencing pain after caustic paste application, use this.
An alternative formula uses borneol powder alone.*

**Internal Supplement Powder**
This formula regulates *qi* and blood, expels pus, and generates flesh.
Begin taking it as the hemorrhoid wound nears closure.
The anus will naturally retract once the wound heals and blood and *qi* harmonize.
*Grind equal parts of the following into fine powder:*
- Ginseng (2 taels)
- Astragalus (2 taels)
- Chinese angelica (2 taels)
- Platycodon (1 tael)
- Ligusticum (1 tael)
- Magnolia bark (1 tael)
- Cinnamon (1 tael)
- Saposhnikovia (1 tael)
- Dahurian angelica (1 tael)
- Licorice (1 tael)

Take two to three doses daily with costus root decoction or warm wine.

**Licorice Decoction**
Simmer licorice and use the decoction to steam and wash hemorrhoids.
Licorice is inherently a hemorrhoid remedy and also neutralizes arsenic toxicity.
If the wound itches abnormally during healing, this decoction—applied warm—is especially effective.

**Hemorrhoid Catalyst**
For hardened hemorrhoids that refuse to detach, apply this to induce shedding.
*Grind into fine powder:*
- Soot from burned herbs (2 candareens)
- White ginger powder (1 candareen)
- Sichuan aconite

Mix with well water to a thin consistency and apply to the hemorrhoid with a brush.
It will detach shortly thereafter.

**Fomentation Method**
After applying the caustic paste, if healthy tissue around the anus stings like needle pricks
or pain radiates to the kidney region during bowel movements,
have someone heat clothing or fabric over fire and apply it warm to the painful area three to five times.
The pain will cease immediately.

**Water-Settled Paste (Reiterated)**
This paste prevents toxic fluid from the hemorrhoid root from contaminating healthy tissue and causing sores.
Apply the paste to oil-treated paper, covering the entire anal circumference,
but do not extend the paper downward—secure it in place.

**Hemmorhoid-Calling Powder**
- True magnetite (separately ground): 1 candareen
- White ginger (separately ground): 1 candareen
- Calcined white alum: ½ candareen
- Raw Sichuan aconite tips: 3 pieces

Grind into powder, then mix with scallion mucus and apply to the anal protrusion. Once the hemorrhoid emerges, use the caustic paste.

**Alternative Formula**
- Magnetite (calcined, quenched in vinegar nine times, ground, water-floated)
- Calcined white alum
- Large Sichuan aconite
- Pangolin scales
- Cinnabar

Grind into powder as above; after emergence, use the washing powder.

**Song of the Twenty-Four Hemorrhoid Types**
This malady stems from excess in five matters: wine, lust, qi, wind, and diet.
The hemorrhoid types number three times eight—observe them closely, sir,
Lest time pass and the sight chill your heart and gall.
Water caltrop’s form is strange; lotus flower, unbearable to see.
Bowel-piercing and rat-teat types arise from wine and lust alike.
Do not wish for the resentful *fan-hua* or the unyielding beehive.
Male and female share the same qi and blood; mother and child coil within the bowel.
The *xuan-zhu* is eerie; the *gou-chang* drills like pain.
Walnut and *liu-qi* types move the heart to sorrow.
The *□-zi* swells large within; the chicken-heart rests without.
Coral’s shape is vile—how much worse the prolapsed anus!
Internal hemorrhoids, red but unprotruded, coil within the bowel’s fold.
The *chui-zhu* is harder still to cure; over time, it grows a cockscomb.
Never treat lightly with blade or fire, lest you endanger life.
Dedicate effort without half-measures to eradicate the disease at its root.

Use the *Hemmorhoid-Calling Powder* as described.

**Red-Flesh Paste for Hemorrhoids**
- Cinnabar: 1 candareen
- Yellow lead: 1 candareen
- Frankincense (separately ground): ½ candareen
- White alum: 1 tael
- Arsenic (placed over white alum, calcined to 70%): ½ tael
- Croton seeds: 3 pieces

Grind into powder. For each use, take 2 candareens of powder, 3 *ban-mao*, and 1 tael of sesame oil. Fry the *ban-mao* and croton seeds until red, then discard them. Mix the oil with the powder to form a paste. Apply according to the hemorrhoid’s size, changing the dressing once every one or two days. After six or seven days, if the area turns black and charred, discontinue application and use the *Cui* powder. For unbroken or broken hemorrhoids, insert the medicine into the sore using a paper wick for best results.

**Golden Flower Powder for Washing Hemorrhoids**
- Pyrolusite: ½ candareen
- *Huang-bo*: 1 tael
- Coptis (raw): ½ tael
- Black soybeans: ½ sheng

Grind into powder. After washing with warm water, apply the *Clam Shell Powder*.

**Dragon Bone and Clam Shell Powder**
- Ulmus fruit: 1 tael
- Dragon bone (calcined): 1 candareen
- Clam shell (calcined): 1 candareen
- Litharge: ½ candareen

Grind into powder. First dust the area, then apply the *Hemorrhoid Paste* once daily.

**Frankincense Paste for Hemorrhoids**
- Evodia fruit
- Bletilla
- Ampelopsis
- Coptis
- *Huang-bo*
- Chinese angelica (equal parts)

Use 4 taels of sesame oil and 3 chi 4 cun of willow twigs. Fry the twigs in the oil until black, then add the powdered herbs and fry until the mixture turns purple. Strain through silk, then boil again several times. Add 1–2 candareens of yellow lead and frankincense, and simmer into a paste. Store in a ceramic jar. Apply a small amount to the sore for immediate effect.

For prolapsed hemorrhoids, first administer blood-moving medicine twice daily, then use the *Hemmorhoid-Calling Powder*.

**Chinese Angelica Decoction for Moving Blood Stasis**
- Coptis: ½ tael
- Hemp seeds: ½ tael
- Chinese angelica: ½ tael

Take as powder: chew 1 *qian*, then swallow with warm wine. Additionally, take one *Tongzhen Pill* immediately before going out.

- Frankincense: ½ *qian*
- Alum: 1 *liang*
- Mirabilite: 1 *liang*
- *She Xiang* (Musk): a small amount

Use an iron or copper pot. First place the arsenic at the bottom, cover with alum, then green vitriol, then mirabilite. When it liquefies, add the frankincense powder and stir evenly. Once dry and stone-like, remove and place on the ground to dispel fire toxicity overnight. Grind into powder, then add musk and a small amount of borneol. Mix with saliva and apply around the wound opening three times daily. The hemorrhoids will naturally wither and fall.

**Another Formula**
Soak *Zhi Qiao* (Aurantium) in water to remove the pith. For every two pieces, remove the peel and insert one croton seed, then bind with thread. Place in a silver or stone vessel, add rice vinegar to a depth of one finger, and decoct until dry. Remove the croton, dry-fry, and grind into powder. Form into pills with vinegar paste. For each dose, take fifteen pills with tea on an empty stomach, or swallow with saliva.

For intestinal wind with bloody discharge, decoct *Ping Wei Powder* with *Xu Duan* (Dipsacus) and take. Another formula adds forty-nine wheat grains and omits *Xu Duan*.

For hemorrhoid sores, use equal parts wax and lotus seedpod, slowly fumigate over low heat until slightly smoking.

For bloody discharge from scalding wind, take 2 *qian* of *Wu Bei Zi* powder with musk-infused wine.

**Hemorrhoid Treatment**
- Alum: 4 *liang*
- Green vitriol: 1 portion
- Arsenic: ½ *liang*
- Mirabilite: ½ *liang*

Combine the vitriol and mirabilite. Place a small portion in a *Jian* bowl, add the arsenic in a lump, then cover with the remaining powder. Burn with approximately two *jin* of charcoal from all sides until bubbling. When dry, grind into fine powder and store in a sand jar. This medicine, aged and fired to a yellow color, is effective and painless. If it turns red, it is unusable. For external hemorrhoids, reduce the alum by half. For rapid effect, mix with saliva and apply. For painless application, mix with licorice decoction. This medicine may be stored long-term without spoiling and causes no pain.

Next, wash with hot *Mao Gen* (Imperata) decoction, then apply the medicine, changing it three to five times day and night.

When hemorrhoids flare, the large intestine is often constipated. Take *Kuan Chang Pill* and *Tong Da Bian* (bowel-moving medicine) to relax the bowels. Do not fumigate with smoke, as it may enter the intestines and cause harm.

In summer, add *Bai Cao Shuang* (Soot) and *Huang Dan* (Lead Oxide) to the application.

After hemorrhoids fall, if the anus is swollen and painful, wash with a decoction of sophora bark, or apply *Zhi Qiao* (Aurantium) ground on a tile with saliva. If the anus does not retract, apply a decoction of *Mu Zei* (Scouring Rush) and mirabilite. Each method is effective after one or two applications.

Before the hemorrhoids fall, decoct *Huang Pi* (Phellodendron bark) and mint, mix with saliva, and apply to the anus. This is especially effective in summer.

**Initial Washing Formula**
- *Mu Tong* (Akebia)
- *Huang Qin* (Scutellaria)
- *Huang Bai* (Phellodendron)
- Black soybeans

Decoct while hot and wash three times.

*Shangqing Ziting Pursuit of Consumption: Immortal Methods and Discourse***

**Preface by an Old Recluse**
This text has circulated for generations, yet its author’s name remains unknown. Only this writing survives; I dare not presumptuously add to it, awaiting those who may recognize its origins.

Since my entry into the world, I have devoted myself to the study of medicinal arts, swiftly aiding those in peril. Acupuncture and moxibustion, the *Mingtang* charts—I have examined all in detail. Searching texts and consulting records, I discern the flourishing and decline of the five viscera. Reflecting on the ancients, I find their wisdom remains unfathomed by the age.

Consider: Why did Duke Jing of Jin die? Why was the Crown Prince of Guo revived? I ponder the feats of scraping bone and reconnecting sinew, of opening the intestines to remove disease—yet none is as inscrutable as the ailment of *transmitted corpse-consumption*. Though it arises within a single body, its transformations are myriad.

For physicians, to clarify pulse signs and trace the root of illness is not inherently difficult. Yet a hairsbreadth’s error leads to a thousand *li*’s deviation.

**On Transmitted Consumption**
*Transmitted corpse-consumption* stems from the *Three Corpse Demons* and the *Nine Worms*, whose calamities are fully expounded here to enlighten the uninitiated.

**General Discourse on Transmitted Consumption**
*Transmitted corpse-consumption* originates in the heart, where qi congeals and blood coagulates, giving rise to worms. This arises from indulgence in drink, lust, sorrow, and the dissipation of essence. Worms become *gu* parasites, nourished by stagnant blood and qi. When qi and blood reside in the womb, they constitute *orthodox qi*; when they lodge in the qi, they form emaciating masses; when they congeal in the heart, they become worms. All this stems from a heart not aligned with the Dao, entangled in the karmic web of sorrow.

The harms of the *Three Corpses* and *Nine Worms* must be known in detail by those who treat this affliction. Among the *Nine Worms*, six are transmitted across six generations, while three—*wei* (hedgehog), *hui* (roundworm), and *cunbai* (tapeworm)—are not transmitted. Of the six, some arise from inherited toxins, others from familial contagion.

At the disease’s onset, the spirit becomes disoriented, qi and pulse grow erratic. Strict abstinence from wine and lust, along with regulated diet, is imperative. Without this, the five centers grow restless, night sweats drench the heart and kidneys, and palpitations arise. Within ten days, the bones waste away, the complexion turns sallow yet lustrous—such are its signs.

Misguided faith in false masters, prayers for blessings, and the ministrations of mediocre physicians only prolong the suffering. When the illness worsens, only through vigilant restraint can fortune be grasped—else calamity follows as swiftly as the turning of a hand.

Upon this person’s death, the affliction passes to brothers, sons, grandsons, and all blood kin, transmitting endlessly until the clan is extinguished.

Generally, the six worms traverse the four cavities within ten days, cycling without cease. The disease takes hold when it encounters the qi of Wood; after the first day of the solar term *Lichun*, the worms begin to feed, consuming once every three days and retreating once every five. As they gnaw, the entire body aches—this is the worms feeding. When they retreat, they return to their cavities and fall into a drunken slumber, sleeping for five days, during which the illness briefly subsides. Only at the moment of their drunken retreat may talismans and medicines be administered; if the worms mature after the talismans and medicines take effect, the treatment will fail.

A single worm roams through twelve cavities; the six worms together occupy seventy-two. In the course of a month: during the first ten days, the worms’ heads point upward, traversing four cavities from the heart to the head; in the middle ten days, their heads turn inward, traversing four cavities from the heart to the navel; in the last ten days, their heads point downward, traversing four cavities from the navel to the feet. When administering talismans or medicines, one must discern their movements as precisely as silkworm larvae in cocoons. For the worms’ nature has already attained spiritual awareness—utmost care is required. If the worms are extracted without replenishment, or if the practitioner is shallow and reckless, resources will be squandered in vain, and the disease will never be eradicated. How tragic this is!

The Master says: To treat *chuanshi lao* (consumptive wasting), one must first understand that the upright qi and the toxic qi move together, so when the viscera congeal, they form worm-like shapes. On yang days, the male worms grow; on yin days, the female worms grow. They first consume the fat and marrow of the viscera, which is why their color is white. Once the five viscera and six bowels are damaged by feeding, the skin shrivels, the hair falls out, and in women, menstruation ceases as the blood vessels are depleted, unable to nourish the five viscera and six bowels. After seventy days, the worms devour all the patient’s flesh and blood, turning yellow-red. As the muscles waste, the body grows emaciated and weak, food no longer sustains the skin, and the sinews slacken, unable to support movement. After one hundred twenty days, when flesh and blood are exhausted, the worms turn purple, then consume the essence and marrow. When they transmit to the kidneys and feed on essence, the worms turn black, and the marrow is devoured, causing the bones to wither so the patient cannot rise from bed. Over time, the worms grow fur, their coats a motley of colors, imbued with the qi of the five viscera and the five phases. After passing through three hosts, they gain the ability to fly, taking forms like birds, with many varieties. Once they enter the kidney meridian, the condition becomes incurable.

The methods recorded state: If the worms are still white, the patient may take medicine to replenish for thirty days. If the worms are yellow-red, replenishment may continue for sixty days. If the worms are purple-black, the disease has reached its extreme, and replenishment must persist for one hundred twenty days. It is also said: If the worm’s head is red, it feeds on the patient’s flesh and may be treated. If its head and mouth are white, it feeds on the patient’s marrow, and the disease is difficult to cure—only measures to sever its transmission to descendants should be taken. Thus, the classics say: If treated within sixty days, seven or eight out of ten may recover; if treated within eighty days, only three or four out of ten. Beyond this, survival is uncertain, and the best one can do is spare future generations from harm.

Here follows the translation of the provided text:

Now, the symptoms and manifestations of the worms transmitted through six generations are detailed below.

**First Generation: Worm Manifestations, Disease Signs, and Daily Treatment Methods**
This marks the onset of consumptive disease, referring to the initial contraction of the illness, where the source remains undetected. The patient continues with wine and rich food, gradually becoming emaciated. Delay in treatment allows the disease to worsen. Physicians, failing to discern the cause, often prescribe mistaken remedies, leading to many deaths.

All the aforementioned worms, once settled within the human body, vary in size. They cause the patient to experience disordered dreams, with the hun and po spirits scattering, the spirit dispersing, and the appetite declining. The complexion gradually wastes away, the limbs grow sore and aching, the joints weary, and alternating chills and fevers arise. The back and shoulders become tense, the head and brain ache, the mouth turns bitter and the tongue dry. The face loses its color, clear snivel flows from the nose, profuse sweating occurs, walking becomes laborious, and the eyes often pain.

On bing and ding days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Xinshu* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After moxibustion to extract the worms, the patient should take medicine to replenish the heart and guard the spirit with *Shouling San*.

**Second Generation: Awakened Consumptive Disease**
This refers to the transmission of the disease, where the patient becomes aware of the affliction. At night, inauspicious dreams occur, and the patient finds themselves in the company of the deceased. Upon waking, all vitality is gone, and the mind remains in a stupor, as if drunk, with the spirit unsettled. Whatever is eaten turns to harm. Qi and phlegm may stir, or wind-toxin may assail, causing disharmony in the limbs, fullness and oppression in the chest, and gradual emaciation. The bones and joints wither, sour water may be vomited, or the stomach may burn with acidity. The lips grow parched, the mouth bitter, the nose congested, and the chest pained. The back and shoulders ache, profuse sweating occurs, and the waist and knees throb with pain.

Such symptoms demand early treatment; delay makes cure difficult and risks fatality.

All the aforementioned worms, once within the body, cause the patient to gasp for breath, the lips and mouth to dry, coughing and chills to worsen, and the heart to feel vexed and congested. The hair withers and falls, qi swells, and sourness is swallowed. Body fluids gradually deplete, leading to frequent thirst. Clear fluid flows from the nose, the limbs weaken, the face reddens while the complexion yellows, and the skin grows withered. The waist and knees lose strength, the spine aches, blood is spat or pus coughed up, speech becomes impaired, the nose clogs, and the head pains. The chest fills with phlegm.

In severe cases, the heart feels stifled, blood is vomited, and the patient may collapse to the ground, unaware of their surroundings.

On geng and xin days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Feishu* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After extracting the worms, replenishing the lungs will restore depleted qi.

**Third Generation: Transmitted Corpse Consumptive Disease**
This refers to the transmission of the disease, where the patient gradually becomes aware of it, growing thinner by the day and altering in appearance. Each day brings distress, each night the fear of death. Without encountering a skilled physician, death draws near.

All the aforementioned worms, once within the body, cause the *sanjiao* to grow muddled, inducing constant drowsiness. Bitter juice or clear water may be vomited, sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, with sticky phlegm often congesting. The abdomen swells and rumbles, and after lying down, the patient startles easily. Sores appear in the mouth and nose, the lips darken, the face turns sallow, and emaciation progresses. The spirit becomes distracted, the hun and po scatter, food is not digested, the voice grows hoarse, and the eyes often blur with tears.

On geng and yin days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Jueyin* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After extracting the worms, replenishing qi will effect a cure.

**Fourth Generation**
These worms take the form of tangled silk within the human viscera...

These worms resemble pig lungs within the human abdomen. These worms resemble snakes and vipers within the five viscera. All the aforementioned worms, dwelling in the human body, cause the viscera and bowels to rumble with vacuity, counterflow vomiting that damages the center, accumulations and gatherings of *qi* masses, alternating chills and high fever, abdominal distension with visible veins, lumbar and dorsal pain, emaciation or vacuity, unregulated diarrhea, difficulty in walking, and emaciation of the four limbs. The patient suffers from upper urgency with panting, a bitter taste in the mouth, dry tongue, and excessive intake of food and water, craving sour and salty flavors.

On *wu* and *ji* days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Pishu* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After extracting the worms, replenishing the spleen will effect a cure, stabilizing the *hun* and settling the spirit.

**Fifth Generation**
These worms resemble mice or small jars, lacking distinct exterior and interior, front and back. These worms may have heads without feet or feet without heads. These worms transform and shift, resembling *jin* of essence-blood within the Yang Palace.

All the aforementioned worms enter the Liver Channel and return to the Kidneys, transforming upon encountering blood. They cause frequent anger and counterflow *qi*, spasms and contractions of sinews and bones, dissolution of the four limbs, darkened lips and sallow complexion, alternating chills and high fever, lumbar and dorsal pain, weakness when rising or sitting, a sensation of the head being cleaved by an axe, intermittent eye pain, nebulae and excessive tearing, stabbing pain in the shoulders and back, fatigue and emaciation, desiccation of the hands and feet, and inability to rise from bed. The condition resembles wind-stroke, with numbness of the limbs, frequent abdominal pain, visualizing black flowers, sudden collapse, loss of consciousness, inauspicious dreams, and profuse sweating upon waking. Some patients may appear ruddy and healthy as usual, while others may exhibit clairvoyance, foretelling future events.

On *gui* and *wei* days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Ganshu* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After extracting the worms, replenishing the liver will effect a cure, restoring clarity and brilliance.

**Sixth Generation**
Some of these worms possess complete wings and legs, capable of transmitting *zhu* over a thousand *li*—so-called "flying corpse"—and cannot be treated by conventional methods.

These worms resemble horse tails, existing in pairs, one male and one female. These worms resemble tortoises and turtles within the five viscera. These worms resemble rotted dough, varying in length or resembling flying birds.

All the aforementioned worms reside in the human body within the Kidney Viscus, penetrating and connecting to the spinal bones. They induce cravings for all manner of food, emaciation, weakness of the waist and knees, cold marrow and feverish bones, desiccation of the four limbs, visualizing sparks or darkness, vacuous ringing in the ears, itching and dampness of the genitals, oily cold sweats, frequent dreams of ghostly intercourse, dark yellow urine, post-sleep stupor, hardness below the navel, or rushing upward to the heart and chest. Objects appear vividly colored, the heart and abdomen feel stifled and chaotic, the joints ache, and food intake fluctuates, sometimes accompanied by panting and coughing.

On *chou* and *hai* days, the worms feed, become intoxicated, and return to the *Shenshu* acupoint. They circulate through the four transport points in an endless cycle. Only when the worms are thoroughly drunk may treatment proceed. After extracting the worms, replenishing the kidneys and filling the essence will effect a cure, dispersing the *Yuying* affliction.

**Su You’s Treatise**
The Master states: Generally, the signs of *chuanshi* disease manifest in the heart, with fullness and oppression in the chest and flanks, vexing pain in the shoulders and back, dimness of the eyes, weakness of the four limbs, and a desire to lie down, though sleep remains elusive. The spine and ribs ache sharply, the waist and knees feel sore, and the patient lies abed most of the time, rising little, appearing feigned in illness. At dawn, the spirit may yet seem intact, as if no illness were present, but by midday, the four limbs grow slightly feverish, the complexion fades, and the patient takes pleasure in visitors, harboring frequent resentment. The slightest dissatisfaction provokes anger, and standing or walking causes leg weakness. At night, the patient sweats stealthily, dreams of ghostly intercourse, or sees the departed, often experiencing fright. At times, the breath feels stifled, or coughing arises. Though craving food, the patient cannot eat much, and death may come in an instant.

The spirit may still seem sound, or there may be slight diarrhea, vacuous distension of the flanks, dry mouth and nose, frequent sticky saliva, intermittent reddening of the lips, or a desire to sleep. Gradually, the patient grows emaciated, like a fish in a dried-up pond, unaware of impending death.

It is further said: The signs of *chuanshi* arise without cause, afflicting the old and young, men and women alike. Generally, the five phases contend and generate within the acupoints, transmitting toxic *qi* throughout the five viscera, leading to gradual emaciation and death. Upon death, the affliction passes to a family member, hence the name *chuanshi* ("transmitted corpse") or *chuanzhu* ("transmitted *zhu*"). As the disease first transmits, the patient alternates between lying down and rising—thus it is also called *yandie* ("concealed burial").

Those with wheezing breath are called *feiwei jie*. Heat within the bones and body is termed *guzheng* ("bone steaming"). When it transmits internally to the five viscera, it is called *fulian* ("recurring link"). If left untreated, it may extinguish an entire household.

For instance, when men or women with vacuity detriment contract this, it is called *laoji* ("exhaustion extremity"). In Wu and Chu, it is named *linli* ("dripping"). In Ba and Shu, it is also called *laoji*. Its origin first arises from the kidneys. Upon initially receiving the *qi*, both channels ache, the waist and back become tense and stiff, the legs weaken when walking or standing, salty foods are consumed sparingly, both ears ring with a sound like wind, and at night, there is seminal emission, yin sweating, and impotence.

Once the kidneys have received it, it next transmits to the heart. When the heart first receives the *qi*, the patient experiences nighttime fright, frequent terror and palpitations, a suspended heart *qi* that seems on the verge of exhaustion, dreams of transmission from the deceased, occasional night sweats, tasteless food, sores in the mouth, vexing heat in the heart *qi*, a constant desire to sleep, worsening symptoms at dusk, and both cheeks, lips, and mouth turning red as if rouged. The palms and soles also frequently burn with heat.

After the heart has received it, it next transmits to the lungs. When the lungs first receive the *qi*, there is coughing, slight pain in the *qi* force, occasional panting, immediate external worsening, dryness of the nose and mouth, an inability to smell fragrance or stench—if suddenly detected, only the scent of decay is perceived—occasional nausea, confusion, and retching. The skin becomes parched, sometimes painful, or as if insects crawl beneath it, with dry flakes peeling like wheat bran.

Once the lungs have received it, it next transmits to the liver. When the liver first receives the *qi*, both eyes dim, the face loses its color, the patient furrows their brow, vision blurs, the eyes are often dry and sore, sometimes red or yellow, and there is confusion at dawn and dusk, a constant desire to close the eyes, yet difficulty sleeping when lying down.

After the liver has received it, it next transmits to the spleen. When the spleen first receives the *qi*, both flanks become vacuously distended, food is not digested, there is occasional diarrhea, worms breed in the undigested food, the abdomen sometimes aches, the belly swells with rumbling, the lips and mouth become parched and cracked, or sores and swellings appear. The hair dries and stands on end, losing its luster. Occasionally, there is counterflow *qi*, shoulder heaving, and panting. If dysentery with red or black pus appears, the condition is incurable.

Now, *guzheng*, *niedie*, *fulian*, *shizhu*, *laozhu*, *chongzhu*, *duzhu*, *rezhu*, *lingzhu*, *shizhu*, and *guizhu* are all called *chuanshi* ("transmitted corpse"). The term *zhu* means "to pour"—the disease pours downward from above. It resembles others, hence the name *zhu*. Its transformations number twenty-two, thirty-six, or ninety-nine kinds. Generally, it causes alternating cold and heat, night sweats, dreams of intercourse with ghosts, seminal emission and white turbidity, dry and brittle hair, or lumps in the abdomen, or small nodules on both sides behind the nape, linked in clusters that gather and disperse. The patient grows silent and withdrawn, coughs up phlegm and saliva, or spits pus and blood like *feiwei* or *feiyong*, or suffers from diarrhea, emaciation, and exhaustion, unable to endure. Over months and years, it leads to death, and after death, the affliction transmits again, easily passing to kin, even extinguishing entire households.

Other conditions like *feichong* ("flying worms"), *dunshi* ("concealed corpse"), *hanshi* ("cold corpse"), *sangshi* ("mourning corpse"), *shizhu* ("corpse *zhu*"), and the five *shi*, as well as major and minor *fuzhu*, cause suffering in unknown locations, with no place untouched, as if possessed by ghostly malignities. Their symptoms are manifold, their transmissions and changes unpredictable, making them difficult to diagnose. Thus, from ancient times to the present, scarcely one in ten recovers. Remedies like fox bones, otter liver, *tianlinggai*, or copper nose locks exist in name only, never proven effective. Only the *gaohuang* transport point and Master Cui’s needling method offer hope—if moxibustion is applied early, recovery may be half possible, but late treatment is futile.

**Symptoms of Consumptive Ailments**

When the patient experiences alternating cold and high fever, spontaneous sweating, a pale face, dry eyes and bitter mouth, ungrounded spirit, and fear of being alone outside, the transmission is in the liver.

When the patient has alternating cold and heat, a dark face and dry nose, sudden forgetfulness, difficult bowel movements or clear diarrhea, and mouth sores, the transmission is in the heart.

When the patient suffers alternating cold and fever, a greenish face and yellow lips, a stiff tongue unable to move, tasteless food, emaciated limbs, and foamy saliva, the transmission is in the spleen.

When the patient has alternating cold and fever, a red face and dry nose, parched mouth and brittle hair, coughing, panting, and urgent breathing, with occasional white phlegm or streaks of blood, the transmission is in the lungs.

When the patient experiences alternating cold and heat, a yellow face, withered and dry ear rims, aching lumbar bones, bloody and turbid urine, and dribbling, the transmission is in the kidneys.

**The Twenty-Four Kinds of Consumptive Steaming**

If the eyebrows break, the hair withers, and the skin becomes scaly, the steaming is in the spleen.

If others feel heat while the patient feels cold, and the body trembles violently, the steaming is in the flesh.

If the hair withers, the nose bleeds, or there is bloody urine, the steaming is in the blood.

If there is feverish vexation and pain like needle pricks, the steaming is in the vessels.

If the nails wither, the eyes dim, and both flanks ache sharply, the steaming is in the sinews.

If the teeth blacken, ache, and dry, and the *dazhu* point is painful, the steaming is in the bones.

If the spine aches, the shin bones sour and [lacuna], the steaming is in the brain.

If men lose essence and women experience spontaneous arousal, the steaming is in the Jade Chamber.

If there is sudden cold and heat, swelling in the central chest and eyes, and internal vexation, the steaming is in the Triple Burner.

If the urine is yellow and red, thick and turbid like paste, the steaming is in the bladder.

If the transmission is uneven, with either diarrhea or constipation, and rumbling in the abdomen, the steaming is in the small intestine.

If the abdomen subtly aches and the right nostril is dry and sore, the steaming is in the large intestine.

If the mouth and nose are dry, the abdomen distends, sleep is restless, and spontaneous sweating pours forth, the steaming is in the stomach.

If the mouth is bitter, the ears deaf, and the ribs beneath ache, the steaming is in the gallbladder.

If there is tenesmus and rectal blockage, the steaming is in the *huichang* [returning intestine].

If the lower abdomen [lacuna] aches, the sinews and vessels slacken and stretch, and the private parts stiffen on their own, the steaming is in the ancestral sinews.

If the eyes are dim and tears flow, with occasional dizziness and vertigo, and vexing anger is irregular, the steaming is in the liver.

If the ear rims are withered and dry, the waist and legs ache and sour, and rising and sitting are difficult, the steaming is in the kidneys.

If the emotions and thoughts are unsettled, essence weeps without cause, trickling ceaselessly, the steaming is in the right kidney, the heart’s pericardium.

If the heart’s diaphragm is obstructed and blocked, with piercing pain, and bending and raising bring vexation and oppression, the steaming is in the diaphragm.

Though the signs differ, their root often lies in worms gnawing. The heart and lungs govern them—one cannot but sever their root.

**Bathing Method**
Fragrant herbs are what the Three Corpses and Nine Worms detest. Boil them to make a decoction for bathing, and those worms will surely die.

Of all illnesses afflicting people today, none is graver than *lao* [consumptive disease]. Even the most renowned physicians under heaven often cannot cure it. Once one person contracts it, it spreads to descendants, relatives, and kin—hence it is called *chuanshi lao* [corpse-transmitted consumption]. It can wipe out entire families and clans, so people all fear it. Some burn the corpse in the mountains or abandon it by rivers and lakes, refusing burial in the family tomb. Kin become estranged, and husbands and wives abandon the rites of union. Such sorrow is deeply pitiable.

Whenever this disease is detected, if one does not first burn away the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, medicine will be ineffective, and ten will die for every one who lives. Most people keep this method secret, not passing it to the world, taking the illness as karmic retribution and accepting it willingly, even to death without regret. Alas, how mistaken!

Now I set forth the methods of the supreme sages to save the world.

In the third and fourth months, take five leaves of fragrant herbs, pound them thoroughly, and sit naked upon them so their qi enters the lower parts and disperses into the abdomen. From dawn to dusk, the corpse-worms will be entirely expelled.

The Three Corpses and Nine Worms dwell within the body, greedy and murderous. Every *gengshen* day, they report one’s sins to Heaven, causing early death. Thus the *Laojun Sanshi Jing Zuan* states: “All people are born, entrusted with form by their parents, and embrace the essence of the five grains. Therefore, the abdomen is full of corpse-worms, harming the person. On *gengshen* nights, they report to the Heavenly Emperor, who records one’s sins and strikes one’s name from the register of the living, hastening death. The hun rises to Heaven, the po sinks into the abyss, and only the corpse-worms remain, now called ghosts. If not offered timely sacrifices, they become malevolent spirits, harming people’s lives.”

**The Method of Guarding *Gengshen***
All people in the world, from kings to great ministers, down to monks, Daoists, and commoners—none are exempt. Women, however, suffer this affliction most severely. Daoist practitioners who do not eliminate the Three Corpses and Nine Worms in pursuit of longevity will never attain it.

On every *gengshen* day, stay awake through the night until dawn. When the body feels weary and fatigued, one may then sleep, but awaken several times so the worms cannot depart to report one’s deeds.

The *Dadi Xuanke* states: “On the eighth day of the sixth month and on *gengshen* days, the Northern Emperor opens the gates of all living beings to hear the pleas of all dharmas. Once one’s transgressions reach five hundred, that person must die.” One should guard *gengshen* to suppress the Three Corpses.

In guarding *gengshen*, the Three Corpses are permanently severed, the spirit becomes clear and sharp, and the Five Spirits grow tranquil.

At the time of scratching and stirring each night, knock the teeth thirty-six times. With the left hand, hold the heart and call the names of the Three Corpses: “Upper Corpse Peng Ju, come forth! Middle Corpse Peng Qi, come forth! Lower Corpse Peng Jiao, come forth!” Thus they cannot cause harm.

Regularly on *gengshen* days, cut the fingernails, and on *chou* days, cut the toenails. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month each year, burn the clipped nails to ash, mix with water, and drink. The Three Corpses and Nine Worms will all be destroyed—this is called “beheading the Three Corpses.”

**Method for Compounding Medicines**
When compounding medicines, one must first purify the mind and fast, burn incense, and sweep a room clean. Do not allow chickens, dogs, cats, children, women, or any impure things to come near. Only then proceed.

**Yue King Wen’s Prescription for Corpse-Transmitted Disease**
The elder of Hunan, Dharma name Qing, obtained an ancient prescription from the time of the Yue King on the twelfth day of the eighth month in the second year of Tianfu of Nanyue. The Yue King’s preface was followed by the prescription and talismanic methods. Afterward, over ten thousand people were saved. In the ninth year of Chunhua, it was transmitted to Minister Ding. By the seventh year of Xiangfu, Thunder Envoy obtained this prescription and saved over a hundred people.

The Yue King’s preface states: “The household of Imperial Son-in-Law Liu Zhi, over three hundred strong, once purchased a maid named Feng Pengshu. One day, she suddenly suffered from indeterminate cold and heat. Medicines were ineffective. After about a hundred days, she grew emaciated and suddenly died. Within five days, Liu Xiang, a son of twenty, suddenly fell ill as the maid had. After over a hundred days of medicines and treatments, he too suddenly died. Thereafter, over a hundred people died of this same illness.

Then the Imperial Son-in-Law himself suddenly developed the same cold and heat. Medicines were ineffective. The Yue King then issued a great proclamation at the palace gate, summoning renowned physicians for ten days. The Daoist of Maoshan, Li Tong, entered the Yue King’s city and asked the Heavenly Envoy. The Envoy said: ‘No one recognizes this sign. Perhaps you, Master, can cure this illness.’

The Master said: ‘This illness has many signs. Some die without clarity, some dream of receiving objects, some dream of seeing worms, some dream of walking together; some share food and drink, converse, or go out in ill winds...’”

Moreover, this illness causes alternating chills and fever, sometimes with coughing; or it may spread the previous affliction, infecting clothing, household items, and all who come into contact. The contagious qi emerges from corpse-worms, often flying into garments and bedding to hatch eggs. Once they encounter human qi and blood, they instantly transform into worms. Emerging from the hair and pores, they first consume the blood and vessels, then the five viscera, leaving the person emaciated and weak. If they devour the heart, the worms transform into ghosts, and no medicine can cure the affliction. If the heart remains uneaten, administering medicine and talismans to expel the worms—purging them downward—can still effect a cure. After eight or nine transmissions, only corpse-qi remains without worms; medicine can then purge foul substances—greenish-yellow and viscous—and restore health.

Immediately remove all clothing from the patient’s body, along with items like those of the dead, and do not keep them in the house for three days. Have the patient handle and store them. If disbelieved, the illness will recur as before.

Liu Zhi then prepared the *Ghost-Wailing Decoction* to expel consumptive corpse-worms. The *Ghost-Wailing Decoction* consists of:
- *Heavenly Spirit Cover* (human skull fragment), stir-fried with ghee
- Turtle shell, stir-fried with ghee
- Bupleurum, with the nodes removed
- Asafoetida
- Benzoin
- Dryopteris
- Twenty-one peach kernels, peeled and tips removed
- Costus root, one *fen*
- Fermented soybean hearts, half a *ge*
- Sweet wormwood, half a handful
- Licorice, two *cun*, raw and sliced
- Areca nut, one *fen* each
- Cinnabar, half a *fen*, ground separately
- Musk, one *qian*, ground separately
- Red-legged centipede, one placed in a bamboo tube, soaked in ginger juice, dried, and one *fen* used
- Black chicken droppings, one *fen* (the chicken must be fed hemp seeds for five days prior to collecting its droppings)

From areca nut onward, grind the five ingredients into powder, mix evenly, and divide into three doses. On a *liu-jia* or *chu* day, apply this medicine. First, soak the preceding eleven ingredients overnight in two *sheng* of boy’s urine. Under the open sky amid the stars, simmer until reduced to eight *fen* by the fourth watch, strain the dregs, and divide into three servings. For each serving, take one dose of the powdered medicine at the fifth watch, warming it before consuming in one draught, then lie down to sleep soundly. At the second or third watch, take another dose. By sunrise, the patient will feel the urge to purge. If not, take the third dose. If purging occurs, the third dose may be omitted.

Collect the expelled foul matter and worms in a basin. The worms may resemble dung beetles, snakes, centipedes, spiders, or earthworms. Immediately burn them with oil and fire, along with filth, and incinerate all the patient’s clothing and bedding. Feed the patient scallion porridge continuously afterward. After several days of treatment, if the patient dreams of people weeping and bidding farewell at night, this confirms the cure.

If worms are expelled, examine their mouths: if green, red, or yellow, the illness is curable; if black or white, they have consumed the patient’s essence, rendering the condition incurable. Even if incurable, the treatment severs future harm.

When preparing this medicine, the patient must not inhale its vapors, lest the worms detect the scent and become harder to expel. Neither should the patient be aware during the decoction process, nor should the medicine be prepared in the patient’s home.

To expel consumptive worms, the *Proven Heavenly Spirit Cover Powder* is used:
- *Heavenly Spirit Cover*, the size of two fingers, washed in sandalwood decoction, coated with ghee, stir-fried, and enchanted seven times with the incantation: *“Thunder Duke, divine; Lightning Mother, sacred. Encountering consumptive transmission, swiftly settle it. Hasten as the law commands!”*
- Asafoetida, two *fen*, finely ground
- Musk, three *fen*, ground separately
- Cinnabar, one *fen*, ground separately
- Benzoin, three *fen*, cut with a bronze knife and ground in a mortar with the other ingredients
- Areca nut, five heart-shaped, ground into powder
- Beaded kansui root, two *fen*, ground into powder (one version omits this ingredient)

Grind the six ingredients into an extremely fine powder, mix evenly, and take three *qian* per dose with the following decoction:
- Chinese chives, two sets of seven stalks
- Scallions, two sets of seven stalks
- Sweet wormwood, two handfuls
- Licorice, two stalks, five *cun* long
- Peach branches (all following ingredients use tender ones from the southeast)
- Willow branches
- Mulberry root bark (or mulberry branches, one version states)
- Sour pomegranate root (or branches, one version states), two handfuls, seven *cun* long

Select these eight ingredients from clean, pure locations. Simmer in four *sheng* of boy’s urine in a silver or stone vessel over gentle and strong fire until reduced to one *sheng*, strain the dregs, and divide into three cups. Mix with the preceding powdered medicine and take at the fifth watch. If the patient is male, a female should prepare the decoction; if female, a male should prepare it.

If nausea arises after taking the medicine, use preserved plum flesh to suppress it. By the end of the fifth watch, the viscera will rumble, and worms along with foul matter—yellow water, abnormal feces, and strange substances—will be purged. If no purging occurs after the first dose, take another after the time it takes to walk five to seven *li*, and a third at dawn, all warm. If diarrhea persists, take five *qian* of powdered dragon bone and coptis mixed with boiled water, then consume preserved plum porridge to restore strength.

**Record of Proven Efficacy**
Yansou obtained this divine formula from an old recluse, and its efficacy has been verified repeatedly. Here, one or two cases are recorded at the end of this chapter, that later generations may know the power of this medicine.

A certain Bureau Director You Lie, a native of Shaowu in Ning Prefecture, had a daughter-in-law who fell ill at the age of sixteen. Her entire body burned with fever, she coughed up phlegm and saliva, her monthly courses ceased, and her appetite dwindled. After more than a year, no physician could cure her. She was given the *Heavenly Spirit Cover Powder*, which expelled a single worm resembling a centipede. It was immediately seized with tongs and fried in a cauldron of boiling oil before being cast into the river. Thereafter, she recovered.

Another case involved a man of over thirty who suffered from chronic malaise. Though he ate twice as much as usual, his flesh did not grow; daily, he craved meat, and if even slightly hungry, his abdomen would ache with fatigue. He took the *Heavenly Spirit Cover Powder*, which purged a dozen small red worms, among them one slightly purple in hue, larger than the rest, with fine hairs on its head. Afterward, he was treated with restorative medicines and fully recovered. He also took the *True Storax Pill*.

Yet another man, aged fifty, required several *sheng* of wine each day. If he drank nothing on an empty stomach, his hands and feet would tremble uncontrollably; a single *sheng* of wine would ease the shaking, and drunkenness would still it entirely. The common folk called this the "wine sickness." Physicians diagnosed it as "trembling wind" and treated him with acupuncture and medicines for days to no avail. Suspecting a parasitic cause, he was given the *Heavenly Spirit Cover Powder*, which expelled a creature resembling a smoked plum. When prodded, it revealed legs—just like a spider. His ailment vanished at once, and he no longer craved wine.

Such are the proven effects. Those who examine illnesses should take heed.

*Volume Ten of* **Emergency Immortal Remedies** *concludes.*

**Musk Powder**
*A formula from the* **Upper Clarity Purple Court Pursuit-of-Consumption Immortal Remedies**

**Musk Powder** treats transmission-consumption, bone steaming, internal heat, and the five consumptions in men and women.

**Ingredients:**
- *Heavenly Spirit Cover* (human cranial bone): 1 *fen*
- Musk: 1 *fen*
- Bupleurum: 1 *liang*
- Rhinoceros horn filings: ½ *liang*
- Ass hide glue
- Eastward-growing peach twigs
- Sweet wormwood
- Eastward-growing willow twigs
- Pomegranate rind (four ingredients above, each): 1 handful
- Licorice: 3 *cun* (length of the patient’s middle finger, left for men, right for women)
- Chinese scallion (white part)
- Green onion (white part): each 7 *cun*

Grind the above into powder. Soak in 2½ *sheng* of boy’s urine overnight. The next day, decoct morning and evening until reduced to 1½ *sheng*. Strain and administer.

If the patient is male, a woman should prepare the decoction; if female, a man should prepare it.

**Avoid:** Cats, chickens, dogs, donkeys, horses, monks, nuns, pregnant women, strangers, and those in mourning—none should witness the process.

Divide the decoction into three doses. Add 3 *qian* of areca nut powder and take warm.

After the first dose, wait the time it takes to walk three to five *li*, then take the next. If nausea arises, have the patient hold a salted plum to suppress it.

After three to five doses, the illness will cease, and strange objects will be purged. If the parasites resemble horsehair or human hair, with red bodies and black mouths, or if the patient feels indescribable sensations like ants crawling, follow the purge with scallion congee. Concurrently, decoct the *Five Viscera Hidden Spirit Powder* to restore the organs.

**For one month after treatment, avoid:**
- Drafts
- Greasy, damp, or salty foods
- Beef, pork, chicken, duck, dog, and similar meats

None who take this remedy fail to recover by the same day.

*Emergency Immortal Remedies, Volume Eleven*

For all those in the world who treat consumptive illnesses, even with prolonged treatment over months or years, the root of the disease may yet remain unresolved—unlike this remedy. For long-standing severe cases, no more than two doses are needed. If the illness is not yet advanced, a single dose of this decoction suffices. The *Hidden Spirit Powder* brings efficacy regardless of whether the condition is chronic or recent. If the purged parasites are red, the disease is curable; if they appear black beneath the abdomen, recovery is uncertain; if white beneath the abdomen, the illness has consumed the marrow, and ten thousand cases yield not a single cure.

**Restorative Formula: Hidden Spirit Powder**
White *fu shen* (poria spirit), *fu ling* (poria), *ren shen* (ginseng), *yuan zhi* (polygala, with hearts removed), *long gu* (dragon bone), *rou gui* (cinnamon bark), *gan cao* (licorice), *chen pi* (stir-fried tangerine peel)—one *liang* each; *dang gui* (tangkuei) and *wu wei zi* (schisandra)—one and a half *liang* each; *huang qi* (astragalus)—two *liang*; large *zao* (jujubes)—fifty to sixty pieces.

Grind the above into a fine powder and divide into eight doses. For each dose, add seven jujubes and two *qian* of fresh ginger, then decoct in one and a half *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng*. Take after the previous remedy, also on an empty stomach. Its divine efficacy is unmatched.

This is a wondrous and secret formula bestowed by an immortal, having saved hundreds of lives before and since. The *Divine Efficacy Powder* treats all forms of consumptive *qi* and parasitic infestations. This formula was obtained from the household of the Prince of Heyuan Prefecture, where it has saved countless lives, its merits beyond measure.

**Sichuan pepper**—two *jin*. Select and discard the seeds and any closed pods, then stir-fry until sweating. Grind into powder. Take two *qian* per dose, mixed with rice-water decoction on an empty stomach.

Alternatively, form into pills the size of *wutong* seeds using wine or flour paste, taking thirty to fifty pills per dose.

**Immortal’s Secret Formula for Expelling Consumptive Parasites**

Peach twigs—select those growing eastward, each seven stems, about four *cun* in length
Scallion whites—seven stems
*Asafoetida*—one *qian*, ground separately
True *benzoin*—one *fen*, remove any stones

Steep the first eight ingredients (excluding *asafoetida* and *benzoin*) in one and a half *sheng* of boy’s urine, decoct until reduced by half, then strain. Dissolve the *asafoetida* and *benzoin* in the decoction, boil again for ten-odd simmerings, strain, and divide into two doses to be taken warm.

*Cinnabar*—ground to fine powder
*Areca nut*—ground to fine powder, half a *qian* each
*Musk*—a small amount, ground separately

Grind all into an extremely fine powder, divide into two doses. Take the first at the fifth watch, the second at the third mark of the hour. By mid-morning, parasites will be expelled—red ones indicate recovery, green ones are incurable. Whatever is discharged must be fried in hot oil and killed. Then consume warm congee or rice to restore vitality. Avoid raw, cold, or toxic foods, and first administer the *Paper Pill* (method described later).

When compounding this remedy, select an auspicious day, burn incense, and pray to heaven and earth. Have the patient lie on a bed positioned in the *fude* direction to take the medicine—its divine efficacy will manifest. The patient must not be allowed to detect the scent beforehand, nor should cats, dogs, those in mourning, the unclean, or women witness the process.

**Worm-Expelling Medicine**
Take one woodpecker and 4 *liang* of *cinnabar*. Feed the bird with 4 *liang* of fine pork for a full day and night. When the bird is extremely hungry, mix the *cinnabar* (ground to mung bean size) into finely chopped pork pieces and feed it.

If no woodpecker is available, use a captured bird, seal it with salt-clay, place it inside, and calcine with strong fire for a full night. The next day, remove it before sunrise without breaking it. Bury it with the salt-clay seal 2 *chi* underground for one day and night, then retrieve it. Grind into fine powder in a silver vessel. Prepare a dose with ash-free wine, add a small amount of *musk*, and blend.

Place the patient in a canopy bed, seal all sides tightly, and use iron tongs to wait for the worms to emerge from the patient’s mouth. Immediately grasp them and fry in boiling oil to kill them. Prepare a blazing fire and boiling oil beside the patient in advance. After the worms emerge, administer the *Fine Grain Powder* to the patient, followed by congee and another decoction, as taken the previous night.

**Incantation:**
*Om ma wu* □ *hum hūṃ cha.*

**Magnetite Worm-Hooking Pill**
Take 1½ taels of magnetite (select specimens with crystalline walls, grind finely), ½ tael of dragon bone, 1 tael of sal ammoniac (leave unground), 1 qian of musk, and ½ tael of calomel (grind separately). Form into pills with beeswax, each the size of a small baby peach. For each dose, pierce a small hole in the pill with a needle, thread it with dark-green silk cord, and tie the end to a large ancient coin. At dawn, have the patient sit facing the broken direction, swallow the pill with warm water, and once it reaches the throat, close the mouth and bite firmly onto the coin. Wait for nausea to induce vomiting; the worms will emerge in various forms. Immediately fry them in boiling oil to kill. If no worms appear but only threads of blood or one or two measures of phlegm, this is a favorable sign. Administer routine harmonizing and spleen-warming medicines for two or three days to ensure full recovery. The used pill may be washed in warm water and reused to treat one or two more patients. For consumptive corpse-transmitted disease, one pill can save two lives.

**Worm-Hooking Divine Life-Saving Powder**
Take 1½ qian of cloves, ½ tael of wine-preserved deer antler, 1 prepared turtle shell (with its plastron), 2 qian of water-ground sulfur, and 1 fire-calcined stone swallow (quenched seven times in vinegar). Grind into fine powder and form into pills with beeswax, each the size of a mung bean. For each dose, affix one pill to a hook, attach a copper coin to a 12-chi-long silk cord, coat the pill lightly with snow cream, and cover it with a section of silkworm cocoon. Have the patient first consume the cream, then swallow the pill in one mouthful. After some time, when the cord stirs, pull forcefully to extract the worms and fry them in boiling oil to kill. Prepare this medicine before sunrise on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. First administer the paper pills, then follow with the divine immortal’s secret method.

**Method for Administering Paper Pills**
When treating corpse-transmitted disease, first purify the mind and heart, burn incense before the deities, and take the paper pills. Coat paper with egg white, let dry, cut into coin-sized pieces, and ingest. Only then administer the aforementioned pills and powders.

**Divine Communion Powder for Treating Corpse-Transmitted Consumption**
Take 1 aconite root, 1 tael of rhubarb, and 2 zhu of ox bezoar. Grind into powder, add seven handfuls each of peach and willow twigs and green wormwood, all chopped, steep in half a bowl of boy’s urine overnight, and decoct at the fifth watch the next day until boiling several times. Strain the dregs, mix half the decoction with the powder, and administer. Have the patient cover with clothing and blankets to induce sweating; the malign matter will descend naturally without requiring purgation. Collect the discharge in a basin and examine its contents: the worms may appear in four forms—one with a head like a horse’s tail, another resembling tangled hair, a third like a centipede, and a fourth like a chicken egg or torn silk floss. Have someone identify these afterward. The patient must avoid hard foods, tea, roasted meats, noisy crabs, blood, raw or cold foods, oily or greasy foods, and preserved items before and after taking the medicine.

**Decoction of Licorice and Others**
Take 2 sheng of wine, decoct in a ceramic vessel until reduced to 5 ge, then add ½ tael each of licorice, coptis, tangkuei, and costus. Decoct until the consistency is suitable, form into pills the size of firmiana seeds, and take thirty pills on an empty stomach at night, with wine or salt broth.

**Purple River Vehicle Elixir for Treating Flying Corpse and Ghostly Afflictions, Emaciation from Deficiency Consumption, Wheezing, and Coughing**
Obtain a firstborn male placenta, wash thoroughly with soap water, then rinse with rice vinegar in a small pot and drain dry. Place it in a small drying basket, sealing the edges tightly with paper to prevent loss of qi. If no small drying basket is available, use a small basket lined with honey-pasted paper. Place the placenta inside and dry over a strong fire, covering it with ginseng to aid the process. Dry until it weighs only twelve or thirteen wen. Once completely dry, add the following medicines:
1½ taels of ginseng, ½ tael of costus, 1 tael each of stir-fried white atractylodes, white poria, poria spirit, tangkuei, and prepared rehmannia, 4 qian each of separately ground frankincense and myrrh, and 2 qian of separately ground cinnabar and musk. Grind all into fine powder, blend evenly with the placenta, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds with red wine paste. Take fifty pills per dose with ginseng decoction, on an empty stomach at noon and evening. Honeyed pills are also acceptable.

**Bright Eyes Elixir, Also Transmitted for Expelling Corpse Worms and Treating Corpse-Transmitted Consumption**
Collect forty pellets of white hare’s droppings on an autumn night (those from the wild are best) and sal ammoniac. Grind into fine powder and form into firmiana-seed-sized pills with refined honey. For each dose, take seven pills with a thick infusion made by pounding ½ tael of raw licorice in a bowl of water. If the patient is emaciated and weak, use roasted licorice instead. Administer at the fifth watch on an empty stomach, cautioning the patient to remain calm. Cold administration is acceptable. After slight improvement in two days, administer again to expel the worms; take during the first ten-day period of the month.

**Green Wormwood Drink for Treating Consumptive Diseases**
Take 1 sheng of seeds and 5 taels of leaves from red-rooted green wormwood (dry in the shade), 3 taels of tender peach twigs, 1 tael each of bupleurum and licorice, 3 taels of tender willow twigs, 2 taels of lycium root bark, and 1 tael of gardenia fruit (adjust quantity based on the patient’s deficiency or excess). Chop the ingredients, and for each dose, decoct 3 qian with 1 bowl of water and two black plums until reduced to seven parts. Take warm at any time.

**Bupleurum Powder for Supplementing Deficiency Consumption**
Take 1 tael each of bupleurum, ginseng, white poria, platycodon, peony, green tangerine peel (remove white pith), tangkuei (soaked in wine overnight), ophiopogon (remove heart), ligusticum, cimicifuga, mulberry root bark, white atractylodes (soaked in rice water overnight), and licorice. Grind into fine powder, and for each dose, decoct 2 qian with 1 bowl of water until reduced to seven parts. Take orally in one mouthful.

**Turtle Shell Decoction for Supplementing Deficiency Consumption**
Take one turtle shell (stir-fried with vinegar until yellow), 1 tael each of bupleurum (remove stem), tangkuei, roasted licorice, platycodon, red peony, and ginseng; ½ qian of musk; 1 qian each of apricot kernel (remove skin and tip, stir-fried), picrorhiza, lycium root bark, and coptis; ½ tael of costusroot; 3 taels each of genuine ghee and white honey; and ½ tael of cassia bark (remove coarse skin, unexposed to fire). Grind into fine powder. Steep 1 jin of sweet wormwood in 5 sheng of boy’s urine, decoct to reduce to approximately 2 sheng of juice, strain to remove dregs, then add ghee and honey to simmer into a thick paste. When cool, mix with the medicinal powder to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. For each dose, take 15 pills with warm wine or rice water, three times daily. In autumn and winter, add seven peach or willow buds and decoct with the aforementioned *Bupleurum Powder*.

**Dryopteris Pill for Expelling the Three Corpses and Five Worms**
Take 5 fen of dryopteris (to subdue the *fushi* corpse), 3 fen each of veratrum (to kill worms), dichroa (to kill *baichong* worms), and magnolia bark (to kill *feichong* worms); 4 fen each of *langyazi* (to kill *weichong* worms) and *qiangcan* (to kill *gechong* worms); 6 fen of *le Iwan* (to kill *chichong* worms); 3 fen of realgar (to kill *shichong* corpse worms); and 5 fen of *wuyi* (to kill *chachong* worms). Select clean ingredients, dry by baking, stir-fry until yellow, then grind into fine powder. Refine with honey to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take 5 pills with river water, three times daily, gradually increasing to 10 or 20 pills. After twenty days of administration, all illnesses will be cured, and the three corpses and nine worms will be eradicated. The patient must observe abstinence and reverence; women who take this will cease to conceive but may later bear children.

**Cinnamon Heart Pill, an Immortal Formula for Expelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms**
Take 3 taels of prepared rehmannia, ½ tael of dry lacquer (stir-fried), and 1 tael of cinnamon bark. Grind into fine powder, refine with honey to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. For each dose, take 7 pills with rice water.

**Realgar Pill, Another Formula for Expelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms**
Take 1 tael each of realgar (ground) and pine resin (ground). Melt the resin to form pills the size of lotus seeds. Swallow one pill at dawn; after seven days, the three corpses will be entirely expelled.

**Light Bone Powder for Treating Consumptive Cough**
Take equal parts mume fruit, gentian, picrorhiza, fritillaria, anemarrhena, turtle shell (stir-fried with vinegar), platycodon, large-leaf gentian root, bupleurum, roasted licorice, gardenia (remove skin), ginseng, sweet wormwood (boiled in wine), ass-hide glue (stir-fried), and apricot kernel (remove skin and tip, stir-fried with wheat bran). Dry in the sun, then grind into powder. Grind a 1-cun piece of high-quality inkstick with well water, mix with the medicinal powder to form cakes the size of a thumb, and dry in a ventilated place for fourteen days before use. For each dose, grind one cake with well water. Separately, grind 50 pieces of myrrh into one cup, then decoct with 2 qian of tangerine peel powder for several boils. Combine with the myrrh infusion, stirring frequently, and take in one mouthful at dawn. After administration, the patient should lie supine and sleep. Severe cases require no more than three doses.

**Gecko Powder, Another Formula for Treating Consumptive Emaciation**
Take 1 tael of white poria (remove black skin, stir-fry in a pan until dry), 2 taels of mulberry root bark (brush with ghee and vinegar, stir-fry five times until yellow-purple), 6 taels of apricot kernel (scald to remove skin and tips, discard double kernels, stir-fry in a pan until dry, then pound in a mortar and press with paper to remove oil completely), anemarrhena (brush with ghee and vinegar, stir-fry until yellow), one pair of male and female geckos (soak in ghee and vinegar, stir-fry over low heat until dry, then brush and stir-fry five to seven times until yellow, taking care not to burn or weaken), 2 taels of fritillaria (brush with ghee and vinegar, stir-fry three to five times until yellow), 3 taels of licorice (crush, brush with vinegar and ghee, stir-fry three to five times until purple-yellow), 1 tael of ginseng (large pieces, brush with ghee and vinegar, stir-fry three to five times until yellow), and 40 wen of high-quality prepared butter (cut into dice-sized pieces, melt in a pan, add ½ sheng of extremely sour aged rice vinegar, mix well, and use to brush and stir-fry the above ingredients—no more than 4 ge of vinegar should be used to ensure proper consistency). Grind into powder. For each dose, decoct 2 qian with 1 bowl of water until reduced to seven parts. Avoid greasy, cold, or toxic foods. In cases of chronic cough, initial administration may exacerbate coughing; persistent use will bring relief. Self-care is essential for recovery.

**Formula for Treating Consumptive Heat, Arresting Depletion, and Relieving Cough**
Take one pair of geckos (wash clean, soak in wine and vinegar, stir-fry), ½ tael of scutellaria, ½ tael each of picrorhiza, large-leaf gentian root, licorice, fresh rehmannia, prepared rehmannia, sweet wormwood, stir-fried ginseng, bupleurum, ephedra, anemarrhena, fritillaria, and apricot kernel (remove skin and tip, discard double kernels, retain tips); 1 tael of turtle shell (stir-fried with wine and vinegar); and 1 qian each of platycodon, gentian, and costusroot. Grind into fine powder and decoct with mume fruit, ginger, and jujube.

**Formula for Treating Deficiency Consumption**
Take 1 jin of apricot kernels. Place with 6 taels of sliced fresh ginger (add 4 taels of sliced ginseng for coughing patients) in a new earthenware pot, add 1 *dou* of rootless river water, and simmer over a gentle charcoal fire until the water evaporates. Discard the ginger and ginseng dregs, cool, and take 5–7 apricot kernels frequently.

**Formula for Treating Corpse-Transmitted Consumption**
Take 1 bowl of boy’s urine and 1 bowl of ash-free wine, store in a new porcelain jar, add one pair of whole sheep kidneys, seal tightly with mud, and simmer over low heat from dusk until midnight. At the fifth watch, warm the jar again, then open to drink the wine and eat the kidneys.

For those critically ill, this treatment takes effect within a single month; even those chronically emaciated and weak may take it. As blood nourishes blood, it far surpasses medicines of metal, stone, herbs, or wood.

**Another Formula**
Take one otter liver, dry in the shade, pound into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily—effective.

**Another Formula**
Take red *wanggua* (commonly called "king melon"), dry over a fire, grind into powder, and take with warm wine—immediately effective.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Moxibustion Chart for Twenty-One Types of Consumptive Diseases, with Preface**
Man, endowed with spirit and receiving *qi*, is governed by the Five Constants. When care is improper, grave illness descends. While the teachings of Qi and Huang are vast, the six ancient classics also record methods—this technique, practiced alone, reveals its efficacy.

The disease known as *guzheng* is also called *chuanshi*, *niti*, *fulian*, or *wugu*. In men, the root lies in primordial *qi*; in women, the source rests in the Sea of Blood. Its symptoms include dry, brittle hair, which may clump or scatter; lumps in the abdomen; nodules on the forehead; night sweats; dreams of ghostly intercourse; clear vision yet weak limbs; rising *qi* and diminished appetite; gradual emaciation; and, over months or years, eventual demise.

When I formerly served as Prefectural Judge of Luozhou, I cured thirteen people in thirty days through moxibustion. Those who recovered before and after numbered in the hundreds across two hundred *li*. Though remedies like fox bone and otter liver are famed in old accounts, and gold teeth or copper noses are rarely seen to work, none compare to this method for rescuing the perilous and urgent. It not only treats *guzheng* but also cures wind disorders, miasmic afflictions, consumptive diseases, pathogenic *qi*, and deviated conditions. Given its broad application, many are healed by moxibustion—though I cannot record them all, I shall outline the general principles. Yet, fearing errors in transmission may mislead future generations, I have illustrated the charts so that readers may easily grasp them. May this knowledge spread widely, preserved in households, so that even those without access to skilled physicians may seek this practice as a livelihood. Restoring the hun and po souls—what difficulty could there be? Those afflicted by this disease, can they afford not to be cautious?

**Feishu (Lung Shu) Points** (2 points)

Located at the thirteenth thoracic vertebra.

**Xuanshu (Suspended Pivot) Points** (2 points)
Located at the twentieth thoracic vertebra.

Additionally, moxibustion at the **Sihua Gaohuang** points is most effective.

**Method for Locating Points**
Have the patient stand upright. Take a fine cord, place it under the sole of the foot (left for men, right for women), align the top with the highest point of the big toe, and stretch it straight up to the transverse crease of the popliteal fossa, then cut. The patient should then locate the points according to the bronze man model.

Alternatively, have the patient sit upright and part their hair down the middle. From the hairline, follow the spine downward with the cord, marking the bone. The patient should again refer to the bronze man model while seated. Take another cord, bend it at the midpoint to the nose, hold it steady, and cut at the corners of the mouth. Then, place this measured cord at the marked point on the spine, ensuring the two ends are even and straight—these endpoints are the moxibustion sites. The center of the cord at the marked point is *not* a site for moxibustion.

**Another Method**
Have the patient sit upright with shoulders slightly retracted. Take a small cord, drape it over both shoulders toward the front, and align the ends with the **Jiuwei** point (located below the xiphoid process). Cut the cord, then flip it to the back and drape it over the spine, centering it on the Adam’s apple. The two ends of the cord should hang evenly—mark the point where the center of the cord meets the spine.

**Another Method**
Take a cord and have the patient sit upright with mouth closed. Measure horizontally across the mouth, then use the two ends of the cord to mark the moxibustion sites as before. Together with the previous four points, each should be cauterized seven to twenty-one times, gradually increasing to one hundred fifty. Wait until the sores are about to erupt, then take the previously measured mouth cord and suspend it from the marked point on the spine. Center the cord and measure vertically downward—the two ends of the cord indicate the sites. Mark and cauterize as before; these are called the **Four Flower Points**. They must be cauterized on a *li* day. The finest mugwort is harvested on the third day of the third lunar month.

Once the moxibustion is complete, the patient must abstain from rich foods and sexual activity for one hundred days, resting the mind and sleeping peacefully. If after a month the condition has not fully resolved, repeat the moxibustion on the original points as before—this will permanently eradicate the affliction. After moxibustion, medicinal remedies should also be taken; the formula follows.

I have carefully read the elder’s preface, which thoroughly discusses the symptoms of *chuanshi* consumption. As for the method of extracting worms from the **Xinshu** point, the *Tongren Jing* warns against its use. Indeed, as Gao Gaosi Zhao observed—though he was regarded as a skilled physician—acupuncture and moxibustion techniques differ from those of high antiquity. How could one claim the efficacy of the divine sages so lightly?

**Another Method**
On a *guihai* day at the second watch of the night, when the six spirits converge, have the patient remove their lower garments and stand upright. Use a brush to mark the slight depressions on either side of the waist—what acupuncturists call the **Yaoyan** points. Then, have the patient lie face down on the bed. Cauterize each point with seven small moxa cones, for a total of fourteen on both sides. The *lao* worms may be expelled through vomiting or diarrhea, bringing immediate relief and preventing further transmission.

**Post-Moxibustion Remedy**
- Fresh rehmannia juice
- Sweet wormwood juice
- Peppermint juice
- Child’s urine
- Fine wine

Combine two *sheng* of each, decoct into a paste, then add:
- Bupleurum (roots removed) – 1 *liang*
- Turtle shell (vinegar-fried) – 1 *liang*
- Large-leaf gentian – 1 *liang*
- Musk (ground separately) – ½ *liang*
- Cinnabar – ½ *liang*

Grind the five ingredients into a fine powder and mix with the paste to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take fifteen to twenty pills with warm wine. Avoid raw, cold, or toxic foods.

**Another Worm-Expelling Formula**
To extract *lao* worms, first cauterize one point on the third vertebra and the two **Gaohuang** points, seven cones each. Then administer a dietary tonic followed by the worm-expelling remedy. The worms may appear as tangled threads or red coin-like shapes.

**Spring Formula**
- Realgar
- Sulfur
- Croton seed (1 seed, pressed for oil)
- Fermented soybean (7 seeds)

Combine with the previous remedy, grind into pills the size of *wutong* seeds.

Next, administer with one *ge* of a young boy’s urine (from one who has not eaten) and one cup of wine.

**Summer Formula**
- *Lufu* seeds
- Carpesium fruit
- Sulfur
- Croton seed (1 seed, oil removed)
- Fermented soybean (7 seeds)

Combine with the previous remedy, grind into pills as before, and take with the aforementioned decoction.

**Autumn Formula**
- Tin ash
- Realgar and orpiment
- Mung bean powder
- Fermented soybean (7 seeds)
- Croton seed (1 seed, oil removed)

Form into pills with the same ingredients, and take with the aforementioned decoction.

**Winter Formula**
- Realgar and orpiment
- Tin ash
- Croton seed (oil removed)
- Fermented soybean (7 seeds)

Form into pills and take with the aforementioned decoction.

**Purification and Clarity Method for Treating Consumptive Wasting**
Transmitted by Master Yuzhen of the Degrees School:

First, refine and purify according to the method. Then take five *qian* of costus root, slice finely, and simmer in a clean new earthenware vessel over a slow fire to extract a thick decoction. Divide this into two portions, reserving the costus dregs. Use one portion to mix with cinnabar for writing talismans, and the other to mix with sweet wormwood.

Take nine *jin* of sweet wormwood, chop finely, and decoct in a clean new iron pot with water for one day. Strain the dregs, retain the thick decoction, add the reserved costus dregs, and decoct again. Remove the dregs, then combine with the remaining portion of the costus decoction and simmer over a slow fire until it forms a paste.

Grind five *qian* of cinnabar into a fine powder, mix with one portion of the costus decoction, and use this to write the Five Qi Talisman for refinement and purification.

Burn and dissolve the Five Qi Talisman in the costus decoction, then use this to dissolve the sweet wormwood paste. Administer to the patient, ensuring they remain unaware of the treatment. Proceed with utmost sincerity. Additionally, avoid allowing any outsiders, animals, or the like to witness the process—this method is unfailingly efficacious. Those who practice this method will find it especially wondrous.
