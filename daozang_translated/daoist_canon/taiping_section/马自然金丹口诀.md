**Verses of the Golden Elixir of the Natural Way (马自然金丹口诀):**

The Golden Elixir of the Natural Way lies within all,
Yet few know how to nurture life for years to come.
Do not boast to others of your myriad powers,
Without a true teacher, your efforts will be vain.

I’ve bowed to countless Daoists in my time,
Yet they only speak of *xinggong* (行功) and swallowing saliva,
Of massage and *daoyin* (導引), of fasting and empty seated meditation.
They know nothing of the true *huǒhòu* (火候) and its secrets,
And spend their nights in labor, all for naught.

Shaking and swaying bones till the third watch,
Till sweat pours like water from every pore.
For thirty years I wandered the seas,
Now homeless, with no place to rest my head.
I sought teachers and the Dao’s profound methods,
Yet all they taught was the cultivation of *zhēnqì* (真氣).

Both life and death bring equal worry,
As they do for all beneath the heavens.
Sixty-four years passed in idle rest,
Until I met *Hǎimán* (海蟾) as my disciple.
He whispered one sentence in my ear,
Like drinking from the *Bodhi* (菩提) tree and *Gānlù* (甘露) nectar.

The *Xuánwēi* (玄微) elixir’s secret is few words,
Yet those who pass by fail to see its truth.
Within the body, sixteen *liǎng* (兩) of Golden Elixir reside,
Nurtured in the *Kūn* (坤) region of the southwest.

Who knows this very substance is the *Huándān* (還丹)?
It thrives in the *Níhuán Gōng* (泥丸宮) of the self.

Now I recognize the Elixir of the Natural Way,
Not sought outside the body, but within its depths.
Nightly indulgence in food and drink is no virtue,
Feasting on abundance brings no benefit.

They say to begin as if struck by the Five *Zhu* (疒),
I laughed and told them, “This is no path!”
All these teachings are but childish tricks,
Often leading seekers astray in the world.

Is it not the Way beyond the body?
To still the mind and gather the spirit.
If the *yuánshén* (元神) does not disperse,
The treasure of life will naturally endure.

The two parents must be paired like the *yùlú* (玉炉) incense,
For *Zàohuà* (造化) knows no distinction—it follows its own law.

The cultivator must unite the Three *Tóng* (同) in one chamber,
Relying on the Three *Yǔn* (田) of the clouds and rains.
Blood is the *shā* (沙) water of the southern field,
While *jīng* (精) and *sǎn* (散) mingle like *yǐndǐ* (銀底) lead.

This is the supreme law of the *Dàluó Tiān* (大羅天),
Granting those who understand it the form of immortals.

The Great Dao is profound, and those who meet it are rare,
The enlightened do not casually reveal its mysteries.
Yet if you still doubt this wondrous method,
Look to the garden’s *dù* (杜) wood grafted onto the pear.

The *dù* (杜) wood becomes the vessel for the pear’s fruit,
Both share the same root nature, transforming their essence.
Before you lie three paths,
And every person holds the ladder to the heavens.

Pressing sand to seek oil is commonplace,
Drilling water to extract fire is no hardship.
Yet the fire that births the lotus is but a minor feat,
While the true *zhèngfǎ* (正法) of *Cízūn* (慈尊) is rare to encounter.

The first merit of the Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Golden Elixir:
When the method is grasped, the shell is cast off, and one escapes the mundane world.
All will say, “You’ve attained it!”
Your body glows, youth restored, as if reborn.

The Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Elixir is known only to the self,
Bright within, dark without—aligned with the Dao’s will.
Above and below like a Golden Realm,
Yin and Yang blend, and the path becomes clear.

No need to wear the *zān guān* (簪冠) or shave the head,
Hide the Way in the world like a white ox.
Even in the *ān* (庵) of ordinary life, the path to longevity exists,
Why chase the *xiāoyáo* (逍遥) of the White Jade Tower?

Daoism and Buddhism both arise from the mundane root,
Yet forcefully wear the *zān guān* (簪冠) and shave the head.
All emerge with rough, outward forms,
None seek the true essence within.

Lead (*qiān* 鉛) and Mercury (*gōng* 汞) dwell in the crucible,
Refined into priceless pearls.
Two characters suffice,
To exhaust all the myriad scriptures.

There are red, white, and green elixirs,
Yet few discern their distinctions.
All fail to recognize their original source,
Lost in confusion, straying from the path.

One comes unknowing, the other departs in ignorance,
Wasting time by asking others for guidance.
While the world’s treasure lies within reach,
They abandon both essence and benefit.

To grasp the One is to complete all things,
To send the Two to their proper places.
To know the Three without further inquiry,
To leap free from the dust of the world.

The method of refining *chìjīn* (赤金) is clear,
The *pútí zǐ* (菩提子) is gathered.
The *kūnlún fēng* (昆仑风) is harnessed,
And longevity knows no end.

The Nine *Zhuǎn* (轉) Golden Elixir transcends years,
The immortal teacher reveals it to the world.
To the heavens, I once took a grand vow,
That stepping beyond the mundane is to become an immortal.
