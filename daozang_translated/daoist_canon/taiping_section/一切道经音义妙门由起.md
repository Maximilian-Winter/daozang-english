**Preface to the Pronunciations and Meanings of All Daoist Scriptures**
*Imperially Composed by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang*

We have heard that the Great Dao is profound and recondite, its wondrous gate empty and still. The writings of Guishan are unfathomable, the purport of Longhan elusive. Moreover, records have gradually become corrupted, and the years have grown distant. The *Yellow Court’s* divine simplicity may encounter doubts like those of swallows and swine; the *Azure Palace’s* true words often suffer errors like the confusion of *lu* and *yu*. Thus, later scholars of the Jade Capital, gazing upon secret seal-scripts, find no path forward; the many sojourners of the Golden Tower, practicing numinous talismans, fall into mistakes. Reverently considering Laozi as the foundational ancestor of the state, We have devoutly transmitted the mysterious scriptures, ever Our lifelong devotion. Examining their discrepancies, We deeply sigh in lament.

Thereupon, We commanded the great virtuous masters of the various abbeys and the scholars of the Two Palaces to deliberate upon their principles, tracing the subtle and profound, sifting through the myriad texts of pearl-strewn jade chapters, and consulting the *Zilin* and *Shuowen* among other works. Entering their inner sanctums, they obtained their essence. The pronunciations and meanings of all extant scriptures number one hundred and forty scrolls; their catalogues of pronunciations, meanings, and scriptures are not included in this count. May this serve to propagate the Azure Origin, unfold the Azure Empyrean, assist in transforming customs, and instruct the common folk. May they entrust their aspirations to the subtle and formless, forever dispelling the delusions of *taoyin*; may they turn their hearts toward the radiant and wondrous, eternally banishing the confusions of *jinhai*—thus it is.

**Preface to the Origins of the Wondrous Gate**
*Composed by Imperial Edict by Shi Chong et al., Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Minister of Rites, Duke of the Principality of Henei, Pillar of State, and Abbot of the Taiqing Abbey*

The Supreme Dao is difficult to fathom, the August Sovereign of Emptiness unfathomable. Though formless and without action, it possesses sentiment and trustworthiness. Formless and without action—it forgets function yet initiates seeing and hearing. Possessing sentiment and trustworthiness—it gestates living beings and governs cold and heat. Heaven and Earth attain it to open and establish; sun and moon attain it to uphold brightness. The Son of Heaven attains it to bring about governance; the state’s mandate attains it to achieve great peace. It is the progenitor of all things, the parent of the myriad beings.

As for the empty and spontaneous, the transformations of appearance and life, the congealing of numinous *qi*, and the metamorphosis into sages—this refers to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning. Thus, the scriptures say: “The form of the formless, the image of the imageless—this is called *huhuang*.” Again: “Within *huhuang*, there are things; within *huhuang*, there are images. Within the dim and obscure, there is essence; its essence is most true, and within it, there is trustworthiness.” Again: “The Primordial Beginning is the responsive transformation of the Dao, the congealing of the One’s essence. It arises through *qi* and is moved to birth, naturally transforming.”

This being so, it does not originate from womb-birth, and thus the scriptures record its lineage. Only after the existence of Heaven and Earth did humanity arise; only after humanity arose did clans and surnames appear. The Celestial Venerable was born at the inception of the primordial chaos—how could there be ancestors? Thereafter, he changed his title to manifest transformation, leaving traces and bestowing numinosity. He entrusted his embryo to the womb of the Hong clan and descended in form from the armpit of Mother Li—this has its reasons.

Yet, the five bodies having divided and the three generations having diverged, he responded to conditions and adapted to things, rescuing the drowning and securing the imperiled, drawing forth the deluded masses, shaping and completing the various clans, his compassion and mercy covering all—difficult to express fully. The so-called true body is the substance of the Supreme Dao; the responsive body refers to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Supreme Lord of the Dao. The dharma-body is the true essence spreading *qi* and transforming the myriad things; the transformation-body is the solitary transformation of Heavenly Treasure Lords and the like; the reward-body arises from accumulating diligence and piling virtue, broadly establishing fields of merit, delighting in stillness and trust, and so on.

Though the appellations of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, and the Most High Lord Lao differ, their fundamental source is not distinct. Further, they entrusted themselves to master-disciple relationships to deliver the multitudes. Sometimes they commanded Yin Xi to enter India to transform the Hu people; sometimes they accompanied the Kunlun of Guigu to propagate the sagely teachings. The path of compassion and salvation knows no distance untraversed.

Now, the natural principles of square and round, movement and stillness, black and white, dry and damp cannot be altered. Blowing pipes and plucking strings, cultivating literature and martial arts—these conditioned practices and usages cannot be abandoned. The natural is the substance of inherent nature; conditions are the function of inherent nature. Through conditions, one cultivates; through the natural, one completes. From this, we may say that lofty immortals and supreme sages, uniting with the Dao and returning to the true, surely augment and expand good affinities, advance without retreat, deliver others and save themselves, penetrate the obscure and fathom the hidden, transform the coarse into the refined, and refine the mortal into the sagely.

Yet the deluded claim that immortals must possess immortal bones, and those whose bone structures accord with it attain it without learning. How erroneous! The Dharma-realm is lofty and profound, the celestial palaces vast and boundless. Five hundred and five myriad [realms] spread across their regions; three thousand great thousands divide their lands. Therein lie the wondrous realms of the Mysterious Capital. The Jade Capital extends the wanderings of the utmost sagely; the Wanyou Immortal Abode is deep and remote. The Yanghe Heaven of the Seven Luminaries, with its wondrous traces profound and recondite; the Taiwei Abbey of the Nine Numinous—these are preserved therein. Vast kalpas record their distant ages, their traces intricate and manifold, ultimately difficult to detail exhaustively.

Now, the bridges and ferries that are established prioritize deliverance. When the state is not at peace, *yin* and *yang* bring harm; misfortune and decline arise in succession, and pestilence spreads. [The Dao] is able to protect and bless emperors and kings, pacify and secure the common folk—how could its merit and virtue be surpassed?

Now, the designations of Daoists comprise seven ranks: first, Celestial Perfected; second, Divine Immortals; third, Recluses of the Hidden; fourth, Mountain Dwellers; fifth, Those Who Leave the Household; sixth, Those Who Remain in the Household; seventh, Libationers.

The ranks of Celestial Perfected, Divine Immortals, Recluses of the Hidden, Mountain Dwellers, and Those Who Leave the Household—these depart from worldly dust and abandon common customs, preserving the Dao and maintaining their true nature. Their traces dwell within the world, yet they are not bound by worldly affairs. As for Those Who Remain in the Household and Libationers, they renounce fame and profit, aspiring to enter the wondrous gate. Their work lies in healing and salvation among the people, and today this Way flourishes in Jiannan and the lands south of the Yangtze.

They are called *Daoshi* (Daoists) because they devote themselves to cultivating the constant Dao. As for their ritual garments, distinctions are not absent. Yellow skirts and crimson-brown robes exemplify the rites of the Orthodox Unity; phoenixes, qi, and flying clouds adorn the vestments of the Cavern Mystery. These are recorded in the scriptures and teachings, and thus shall not be enumerated here.

The true scriptures are profoundly abstruse: some condense emptiness and weave qi, naturally forming their chapters; some harmonize with the radiance of Fu Li and the dawn, as sages expound their mysteries; some descend as celestial writings, their jade characters transmitted anew; some emerge through sacred masters of successive generations, who compose and elucidate their numinous purport. Thereafter, they are transmitted in succession, allowing their circulation. At times, they are expounded from precious thrones, heard and received by the ten directions.

Thus, they protect and sustain emperors and kings, ensuring the peace and tranquility of the realm; they deliver and uplift the drowned and lost, guiding souls and spirits to ascend. Benefiting others and aiding oneself, they align with the Dao and merge with the profound truth. The subtle efficacy of their dharma-power is beyond description. Those who revere and believe in them thereby enjoy blessings, while those who slander and defame them incur disaster—like a shadow following form, like an echo responding to sound.

Thus, the Yellow Emperor and the Xia sovereigns, in their reverence, attained the Way of ascending immortality and accomplished the merit of great peace. Emperor Wu of Liang and Emperor Xuan of Qi, in their slander, invited the disgrace of calamity and ruin, receiving the retribution of downfall. Our dynasty, inheriting the lineage of the Li tree and following the teachings of the Qianlin, perpetually entwines its thoughts with the true and numinous, ever venerating the fragrance of the Dao and its virtue. Embracing non-action and tranquility, it upholds and propagates the wind of *wuwei* and *chuigong*; surpassing the sagely and divine, it further illuminates the teaching of wordless instruction.

Thereafter, with vermilion chambers lightly tasked and purple corridors largely at leisure, they unfurled the phoenix-tasseled scriptures of immortals and unsealed the dragon-sealed esoteric formulas. Yet the texts abounded in arcane allusions, their graphs diverging from common forms. Desiring that all under heaven widely recognize the numinous tones, an edict was issued appointing the Gold and Purple Light-Lord Grand Master, Minister of Rites, Extraordinary Appointment with Regular Rank, Pillar of the State, and Duke of the Principality of Henei, Master of the Taiqing Abbey, Minister Shi Chong, as Chief Commissioner; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Minister of the Household of the Heir Apparent, Pillar of the State, Minister Lu Zizhen, as Deputy Commissioner; and the Gentleman for Consultation, Probationary Chief of the Right Guard of the Imperial Bodyguard, Minister Shi Gao, as Recorder. Together with the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting President of the Secretariat, concurrently Right Mentor of the Heir Apparent, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Baron of the Principality of Anping, Minister Cui Ti; the Gold and Purple Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Minister of Rites, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Duke of the State of Jin, Minister Xue Ji; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Right Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, concurrently Acting Left General of the Feathered Forest, Pillar of the State, and Duke of the Principality of Gaoping, Minister Xu Yanbo; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Right Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, concurrently Acting Right General of the Feathered Forest, Pillar of the State, and Marquis of the Principality of Shouchang, Minister Jia Yingfu; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Yellow Gate Attendant, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Baron of the Principality of Zanhuang, Minister Zhu Yi; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Right Instructor of the Heir Apparent, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, and Companion Reader to the Prince of Song, Pillar of the State, Minister Qiu Yue; the Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Acting Vice Minister of Works, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, and Pillar of the State, Minister Lu Zangyong; the Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Acting Vice Director of the Palace Library, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, and Pillar of the State, Minister Wei Liqi; the Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Acting Vice Minister of the Court of the Imperial Treasury, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Baron of the Principality of Wuxing, Minister Shen Quanqi; the Grand Master for Thorough Consultation, Director of the Bureau of State Visits, concurrently Acting Right General of the Feathered Forest and Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Pillar of the State, Minister Li You; the Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Acting Master of the Household of the Heir Apparent, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, and Pillar of the State, Minister Zhang Qixian; the Grand Master of the Palace with Silver Seal, Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, and Light Chariot General, Minister Zheng Xi; the Gentleman for Court Discussion, Acting Vice Director of the Palace Library and Academician of the Zhaowen Hall, Minister Hu Hao; the Gold and Purple Light-Lord Grand Master, Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Duke of the State of Lu, Minister Zhu Qinming; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Yellow Gate Attendant, concurrently Compiler of the National History and Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Duke of the Principality of Donghai, Minister Xu Jian; the Gentleman for Court Discussion, Guardian of the Secretariat and Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Minister Wang Ju; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Pillar of the State, and Baron of the Principality of Pingliang, Minister Yuan Banqian; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master and Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Pillar of the State, Minister Hu Xiong; the Silver and Cyan Light-Lord Grand Master, Acting Director of the National University, Academician of the Chongwen Hall, concurrently Reader to the Imperial Heir, and Pillar of the State, Minister Chu Wuliang; the Grand Master for Thorough Consultation, Acting Vice Director of the Palace Library, Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Supervisor of the Hall, Pillar of the State, and Baron of the Principality of Juchao, Minister Liu Zixuan; the Gentleman for Court Discussion, Acting Vice Director of the Secretariat and Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Light Chariot General, Minister Jia Zeng; the Gentleman for Court Discussion, Vice Director of the Secretariat, Palace Attendant, and Academician of the Chongwen Hall, Pillar of the State, Minister Su Jin; the Great Virtue of the Capital Taiqing Abbey, Zhang Wanfu; the Great Virtue, Liu Jingyan; the Great Virtue, Tian Junkai; the Great Virtue, Ruan Xiaobo; the Abbot of the Capital Xuandu Abbey, Yin Jingchong; the Great Virtue and Abbot of the Capital Dongming Abbey, Kou Yidai; the Dharma Master of the Capital Taiqing Abbey, Sun Wenxian; the Great Virtue, Shi Juzhen; the Great Virtue, Shan Dayi; the Great Virtue, Gao Zhenyi; the Great Virtue, Zhang Fan; the Great Virtue, Tian Keqin; the Great Virtue, Fan Xiansha; the Abbot of the Zongsheng Abbey, Hou Yuanshuang; the Dharma Master of the Dafutang Abbey in the Eastern Capital, Hou Baoxu; the Chief Seat, Zhang Zhixu; Liu Yuanliang; the Abbot of the Yuqing Abbey in Jiangzhou, Bao Zhou, and others—these assembled the extant Daoist scriptures, examined their origins and ends, and compiled their *Pronunciations and Meanings*.

Yet as the cycles of fate stretched vast and the ages shifted, times knew both peace and peril, and the scriptures saw concealment and revelation. Some descended at the kalpa’s dawn only to ascend again at its dusk; others, under rulers devoid of the Way, were cast into embers and ashes.

Some among the devoted and discerning concealed them in mountain caves and grottoes. Thus fragmented and scattered, their ranks disordered, scarcely one in a hundred remains when judged by the eye alone. Now, based on the over two thousand scrolls of scriptures presently held in the capital’s repository, we have composed this *Pronunciation and Exegesis*, as fully detailed in the catalog. The remaining scriptures, rituals, biographies, treatises, commentaries, and records—those readily comprehensible—are not exhaustively annotated here. The lost and dispersed await future collection, with the hope of restoration to mend what is missing.

Yet the scriptures, ancient and distant, bear characters born of divine sages; their Sanskrit tones are rarely fathomed, their cloud-seal scripts scarcely glimpsed. Some have been recklessly embellished by the unlearned; others, miscopied in transmission, distorted by false claims. Some interweave spurious doctrines with true texts, or cull florid phrases to gloss the classics, making it impossible to unify their interpretations or dismiss them as sacred writ. In this present compilation, where understanding falters, gaps are left to await the wise. It is titled *Pronunciations and Meanings of All Daoist Scriptures*.

Additionally, six chapters of *The Origins of the Wondrous Gate* have been compiled, listed as follows. Together with the catalog of scriptures annotated here and the old scriptural catalog, this totals one hundred and thirteen scrolls.

We, Chong and others, are but humble students of the jade tablets, our minds dim to the treasure of the esoteric. Yet, prostrating before the celestial radiance, we dare offer our meager knowledge. Unfurling the brocade of hidden wisdom, we stand ashamed; facing the threads of discourse, we lose ourselves.

**I. Illuminating the Dao and Its Transformations**
The *Laozi’s Dao Scripture* states:
There is a thing, formless yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent, desolate,
it stands alone and unchanging,
circling without end,
the mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name—
I style it the Dao.

It further says:
The Dao is empty, yet its use never exhausted,
abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
I know not whose child it is—
it appears before the Lord of Heaven.

And again:
Look for it, it cannot be seen;
listen for it, it cannot be heard;
grasp for it, it cannot be held.
Meet it, you cannot see its head;
follow it, you cannot see its rear.

The *Virtue Scripture* says:
The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things,
the treasure of the good,
what the ungood treasure.

The *Sutra of the Great Vows and Precepts* says:
The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said: The Dao is Nonbeing, yet it pervades the boundless. If you seek it, it lies near in your own body—yet it is also Being.

The *Regulations of the Supreme Perfected* says:
The Dao possesses tranquil wisdom, active spirit, and primordial qi. Qi transforms into forms, spirit into shapes, wisdom into sounds. Its essence is too subtle to grasp, its hue too faint to see, its sound too rare to hear.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* says:
The Great Dao is profoundly wondrous, arising from spontaneity,
born of the unborn, prior to the primal beginning,
emerging from the empty and vast.
It nurtures heaven and earth,
and is called the Supreme Orthodox True Dao.
Mysterious and remote, beyond naming,
it is the ancestor of the formless qi,
the root of heaven and earth.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* says:
The Dao is what heaven and earth constantly follow,
what the myriad things receive as their mandate to live.

The *Inner Chapters of the Mysterious and Wondrous* says:
The Primordial Dao originally arises,
emerging from the headless,
the ancestor of the ten thousand qi,
the origin of the ten thousand ways.
Before Being, without cause for reverence,
without superior or honor,
it cannot be surpassed.

The *Scripture of the Three Heavens’ Inner Explanation* says:
The Great Dao’s primordial origin
begins before the primal,
in the vast and formless chaos,
without cause.
Empty and spontaneous,
it transforms and generates.

The *Precepts of Solitary Purity* says:
The Dao is the ancestor and head of heaven and earth,
the father and mother of the myriad things.

The *Nanhua Scripture* says:
The Dao has sentiment and trust,
is without action and form.
It can be attained but not seen,
transmitted but not received.
Before heaven and earth existed,
it has endured since ancient times.
It spirits forth gods and lords,
gives birth to heaven and earth.

**II. Illuminating the Heavenly Worthy**
The *Laozi’s Dao Scripture* says:
Formless form, thingless image—
this is called the indistinct and vague.
Within the indistinct and vague are images;
within the dim and dark are essences.
Its essence is most true,
within it is trust.

The *Regulations of the Supreme Perfected* says:
The Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Void Sovereign is most noble and supreme,
without birth or death,
serene and eternally abiding.

The *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Great Mystery Metropolis* says:
The Supreme One said: On the Jade Capital Mountain of the Great Mystery Metropolis stands a seven-jeweled city, within which is a seven-jeweled palace, and within that, a seven-jeweled mystic terrace. This is where the Supreme Non-Ultimate Void Sovereign, the Great Dao Lord, governs. All the heavenly sages, Heavenly Worthies, emperors, lofty immortals, and perfected beings observe fasts and uphold the law, venerating the Void Sovereign of the Supreme One here.

The *Scripture of the Primordial One of the Great Mystery* says:
The Supreme Dao Lord said: By past blessings, I have beheld the teachings, admonitions, scriptures, and precepts of the Dharma King. As if granted a manifest office, I oversee the three realms and govern the myriad spirits. The grace is too vast for comparison. Yet ascending to the Dao’s position is all due to the master. The original practices cultivated by me, the Void Sovereign Supreme Great Dao Lord—*The Five Numinous Treasures*, *The Inner Teachings of Ascending Mystery*—have turned through kalpas without end. Even if one spoke of them for all time, they could not be exhausted.

The *Commentary on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures* says:
The Void Sovereign Supreme One is the master of the Heavenly Worthy.
“Void” means having being without substance;
“Sovereign” means radiance, brilliance.
Thus, the void and tranquil clarify its body,
while radiance and brilliance manifest its virtue.
One name is the Void Nonbeing,
another the Void Emperor,
another the Sovereign One,
also called the Emperor One.
“Void Nonbeing” means empty and still, without form.
“Emperor” means truth, signifying precise and true response.
“One” means the primordial origin, also denoting supreme and peerless.
The Heavenly Worthy takes the void and tranquil as master,
with unhindered wisdom and luminous, penetrating illumination.
These are all different names for the same essence.
The Heavenly Worthy’s disciple is the Supreme Dao Lord.

The Heavenly Worthy pervades and transforms the ten directions, having already passed through the past and bestowed upon the Dao Lord the title of Supreme One, making him the master of transformation and salvation. The two Lords—past and present—are both called Supreme One, serving as the teachers and origins of all.

The *Scripture of Limitless Numinous Treasure* states:
In the primordial ancestral kalpa, the Heavenly Worthy gave birth to the various heavens, illuminating the Three Luminaries—this is the root of heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body.

The *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states:
The Great Dao spreads its transformation, nurturing all things, giving life to the myriad beings, establishing heaven and earth, setting in place the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and great peaks. It appoints numinous officials, governing overseers, perfected persons, and Daoist masters to guide, transform, and administer. Heaven and earth unite to generate and transform the myriad things, presided over by the Supreme Heavenly Worthy. All celestial bureaus and transformative nurturing are ultimately under the governance of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Culmen—this is the Northern Culmen Heavenly Lord spoken of in the *Scripture of Great Peace*.

The *Scripture of the Celestial Master’s Inquiry* states:
The Perfected Person of Orthodox Unity asked the Dao Lord: “We do not know—before the Primordial Heavenly Worthy attained the Dao, what was his ancestral origin, his fundamental root? We humbly request that you make this clear, so that all may see and understand.”
The Dao Lord replied: “The Dao is Nonbeing. It has no ancestor, no origin, no root, no source. It is the One Form, the Formless—this is its primordial nature. Since it is called the Primordial Beginning, how could it have an origin or root? Though it guides and leads all things, the Dao is the most revered, eternally abiding in the Three Clarities, transcending all heavens. For this reason, it is titled the Heavenly Worthy, or sometimes the Jade Emperor, or the Lofty Sovereign, adapting to all in accordance with their needs.”

The *Scripture of Penetrating Spirit* states:
The Great Dao descends in numinous response, engaging with all things. Some have names but no given words, some have given words but no surnames; some have titles but no names, and no surnames. Each arises from karmic resonance, varying in manifestation. These are the true spirits, all responses of the Dao.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Opening of Heaven* states:
The Supreme Dao Lord said: Before heaven and earth divided, within the primordial chaos, there was no light, no form, no ancestor, no origin—only the Dao, profoundly still and spontaneous, obscure and indistinct, with only the true essence existing alone. When qi descended and divided, it responded by generating the primordial unity. From this, transformation arose, and the Three Qi were again present. The Primordial Beginning is the Dao’s responsive transformation, the congealed essence of the One, utterly pure and unadulterated, inwardly and outwardly clear and unsullied. It arises from qi in response to karmic conditions, transforming naturally, adapting to circumstances. With a jade-like substance and golden countenance, it is the root of all things—hence it is called the Primordial Beginning.

The *Numinous Treasure Ritual of Fasting* states:
The Most High Jade Emperor Heavenly Worthy of the Past, the Supreme Ultimate Heavenly Worthy of the Future, and the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Present.

The *Scripture of Karmic Retribution and Causation of the Supreme One* states:
At the beginning of heaven and earth, at the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Formless, transforming in the Jade Clarity realm. I revealed the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, descending to the world to teach and transform, becoming the Mysterious Master of the Ten Thousand Heavens and the Supreme Dharma King. During the Yan Kang kalpa, I was called the Nameless, transforming in the Highest Clarity realm. I revealed the *Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Penetrating Mystery*, descending to the world to teach and transform, becoming the Healing King of the Three Realms and the Supreme Perfected Worthy. At the opening of the Crimson Brightness kalpa, I was called the Brahmanic Form, transforming in the Grand Clarity realm. I revealed the *Scripture of the Divine Immortals of the Penetrating Spirit*, descending to the world to teach and transform, becoming the Guide of the Ten Directions. It further states: When the Supreme Heavenly Worthy inaugurated the Kai Huang kalpa, I was called the Void Sovereign, transforming in the Primordial Yang Palace. I expounded the Three Caverns, descending to transform the human realm, and was titled the Supreme Dao Lord.

The *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* states:
The Highest Perfected Supreme Great Dao Lord of the Highest Clarity is the essence of jade dawn’s qi and the purple mist of auspicious clouds. His jade radiance shines brilliantly, his golden reflection flows with truth. He coalesces transformation, containing refinement, enfolding and congealing to establish spirit. Entrusted to the womb of his mother, he was nurtured into human form. His mother carried him for three thousand seven hundred years before he was born on the Crimson Mystery Slope of the Floating Mountain in the Western Heaven’s Yu Cha realm. He received the register of the Purple Emperor, presiding over the high immortals. He stirred the vermilion winds and crimson purity, convening the assembly of the ten thousand spirits. The profound abyss and towering peaks resounded with the pervasive fragrance of the supreme tone. Yearning for the jade reality’s ethereal rosy clouds and the Highest Clarity’s numinous dawn, he ascended the purple steps twice, soared through the jasper palaces thrice, attended the Grand Simplicity four times, and feasted in the Jasper Chamber five times. Grasping the Five Elders, he penetrated the utmost mysteries of the primordial source. Thereupon, he received the scriptures of the Jade Void, gazed upon the luminous scenes of the Highest Clarity, and was enthroned as the Supreme Highest Perfected Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, governing the Sevenfold Radiant Purple Chambers of the Jeweled Flower Jade Palace.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states:
Those who attain the heart-mind of the Supreme One are all naturally formless. Only the great celestial immortals who possess the true Dao can attain the heart-mind of the Supreme One. How could others encounter the Dragon’s Splendor?

The *Scripture of the Nine-Writ Purple Phoenix Crimson Book* states:
At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord reposed in the Dragon’s Radiance chariot, driving the empty green carriage. The assembled immortals stood in attendance, while the vast music filled the empty courtyard. The numinous joy awakened in wondrous enlightenment, and the chanted verses stirred the golden stanzas.

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states:
The Supreme Dao Lord said: “I bathe in the flowing fragrance of the purple dawn, born of the imperial lineage above. I cycle through kalpas of death and rebirth, existing in every age without end, eternally encountering the Numinous Treasure and emerging together with it. Through seven hundred billion kalpas, at the end of the Azure Emperor’s kalpa, when the Nine Qi transformed the kalpa, I then entrusted myself to the womb of the Hong clan, congealing my spirit in the jasper womb’s palace. After three thousand seven hundred years, at the opening of the Crimson Brightness kalpa, in the year of jiazi, I was born in the Floating Mountain of the Western Na Yu realm. Once again, I emerged together with the Numinous Treasure to deliver humanity.”

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states:
The Supreme One is the descendant of the Dao, the essence of the Dao’s origin, the root of the Dao’s profundity. Thus, he is the Perfected Person of the Highest Clarity and the teacher of the Venerable Lord.

The *Scripture of the Inner Explanation of the Three Heavens* states:
Within the hidden feast, it arises from the empty cavern...

Within the empty cavern, it arises from the Great Nothingness;
From the Great Nothingness’s transformations emerge the Three Qi of Xuan, Yuan, and Shi,
Intermingling in primordial chaos, giving birth to the Wondrous Jade Maiden.
After the Wondrous Jade Maiden’s birth, the congealed qi coalesces, transforming to give birth to Laozi.
Laozi is Lord Lao.

The *Scripture of Laozi’s Girdle* states:
Laozi said: “I was born before formlessness, arose prior to the Great Beginning,
Moved within the origin of the Great Simplicity, stood at the verge of the Great Subtlety,
Wandered amid the hidden void, entered and exited the gate of profound obscurity.”

The *Preface and Exegesis of the Scripture of Dao and Virtue* states:
Laozi embodied spontaneity itself, born before the Great Nothingness,
Arose without cause, traversing the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, beyond all reckoning.
It further states: The world says Laozi descended again in the Zhou dynasty.
Yet Laozi’s title originated in kalpas beyond number—his profundity and remoteness stretch into the distant past.
Before the world’s unfolding, he repeatedly descended as the state’s teacher, age after age without cease, unknown to all.

The *Annals of Louguan* states:
When Yin Xi encountered Lord Lao, Lord Lao honored Xi as the Supreme Perfected Person, bestowing the title Master Wen Shi, who then gazed afar beyond the Four Seas and Eight Directions.
He further ascended the Nine Heavens to pay homage to the Supreme Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord,
Who commanded him to descend and transform the Western Regions—through Zhaozhi, Anxi, Kunwu, Da Qin, Jibin, and Tianzhu—traversing eighty-one lands, propagating the Buddhadharma to civilize the Hu peoples.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states:
Laozi was a disciple of the Supreme One.
At seven years of age, he grasped the essentials of longevity, thus becoming the Perfected Person of the Great Ultimate.

The *Scripture of the Wondrous and Mysterious Inner Chapters* states:
The Wondrous Jade Maiden arose from the intermingling of the Three Qi—Xuan, Yuan, and Shi—in primordial chaos, transforming into the Two Qi.
After eighty-one myriad billion years, the Wondrous Jade Maiden was born.
Following her birth, the Three Qi transformed into a five-colored, mysterious yellow mass, large as a pellet, which entered the Wondrous Jade Maiden’s mouth; she swallowed it, and after eighty-one years, Laozi emerged from her left armpit, born with white hair—hence his title Laozi.
Laozi is Lord Lao.
He received the Supreme One’s solemn charge, completing Heaven and establishing Earth, descending age after age as the state’s teacher.

The *Arrayed Records of the Dao Lord* states:

After the Sage, in the third year of the Gonghe regency, on the day when virtue and harmony conjoined, he first took form in this land beneath the Heavenly Steely Mirror Mountain in the household of the Li clan. At five years of age, he already delighted in the Dao and rejoiced in the Real, his words forming perfect compositions. At twenty, endowed with a golden countenance and jade-like visage, he abandoned his home and departed from his kin, leaving traces in the windblown dust to wander among the famed mountains. He awakened to the transformations of the Three Qi, obscurely aligning his spirit-pivot with the True. His resolve soared into the emptiness of the mysterious; his sincerity penetrated the subtlest depths. His heart dwelled beyond the radiance of the heavens, embracing simplicity while concealed within the folds of his robe. His inner virtue was perfectly full; external entanglements were wholly severed. He cast aside the nets of immortals upon the earth, seeking the Supreme Perfected in the Purple Palace. Thereupon, the Heavenly Thearch descended with teachings, streaming forth radiant splendor, bestowing upon him the *Great Chapters of Yuyi* and the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, granting him a flying canopy of winding dawn, feeding him the quintessence of revolving mystery-jade, and presenting him with white feathers and dark pinions to ascend the eight directions.

Both the *Wondrous Inner Chapters* and the *Inner Transmission of the Most High Lord Lao* state: Lord Lao was born from the left armpit of Lady Li. Initially, Lady Li, napping at midday, dreamed of the sun’s streaming light entering her mouth; she swallowed it and thus conceived. After seventy-two years, she gave birth beneath a plum tree. Lord Lao pointed to the tree and said, “This shall be my surname.” In the time of King You, Lord Lao, accompanied by twelve jade maidens and twenty-four immortals, together with Guigu and others, rode a white deer out of the Western Pass, journeying north to Kunlun.

The *Scripture of Lord Lao* states: The title “Laozi” is the Dao’s responsive manifestation. As form appears, name emerges; thus the title arises. Endowed with complete talent and virtue, encompassing salvation and deliverance, his merits unmatched, his instruction tireless, he is collectively called the Supreme Laozi, Great Master of the Mysterious Center.

The *Inner Transmission of the Supreme Perfected* states: Yin Xi asked, “May I inquire as to the Venerable One’s surname and given name?” Lord Lao replied, “My surname and name are subtle and distant, spanning kalpas from age to age, not to be fully recounted. Thus, they cannot be fully revealed to the world before or after. Now, my surname is Li, my given name Er, my courtesy name Boyang, and my secondary name Laodan.” It further states: The *True Form Charts* of the Supreme Thearch, Lord Lao, and the Primordial Unity Sovereign—these three sages may also be considered as one. The Supreme Thearch’s head bears a natural topknot, his neck radiant with celestial light, draped in a nine-colored brocade robe adorned with floral patterns, clad in heavenly garments. The other two sages wear seven-colored robes, each seated upon a lotus. The Supreme Thearch serves as their master.

The *Treasure Mystery Scripture* states: First, he is called the Spontaneous; second, the Boundless; third, the Great Dao; fourth, the Utmost Real; fifth, the Supreme Thearch; sixth, Lord Lao; seventh, the August Sovereign; eighth, the Heavenly Worthy; ninth, the Jade Emperor; tenth, the August Presence.

The *Highest Records of Lord Lao*, the *Mysterious Center Records*, the *Records of Lai Xiang*, the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, and the *Records of the Western Expedition* all state that Lord Lao served as the teacher of twelve emperors—or, some say, thirteen sages. During the time of Fuxi, he emerged as the teacher, named Master Yuhua; during Shennong’s time, Master Dacheng; during Zhurong’s time, Master Guangcheng; during Cangjie’s time, Master Heijing; during Emperor Ku’s time, Master Chijing; during the Yellow Emperor’s time, Master Limu, also called Master Dacheng; during Emperor Yao’s time, Master Wucheng; during Emperor Shun’s time, Master Yinshou; during Yu of Xia’s time, Master Jixu; during Tang’s time, Master Xishou; during King Wen’s time, Master Xieyi, serving as the Archivist; during King Wu’s time, Master Yucheng; during King Cheng’s time, Master Jingcheng; during King Kang’s time, Master Guoshu; during King Zhao’s time, he retired from office, journeying west to transform the Hu. During Confucius’s time, he emerged as the teacher, known as Laozi.

**Illuminating the Dharma Realm, Third Chapter**

The *Scripture of Karmic Causes and Retributions of the Supreme Thearch* states: The Supreme Thearch said: In each of the ten directions’ worlds, there are fifty-five myriad fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty heavens, arrayed in square domains, establishing celestial palaces. Above the heavens and below the earth, upon the earth and beneath the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, mountains, rivers, and marshes, coalescing qi and soaring clouds form golden towers and jade pavilions, jeweled halls and jasper chambers, rosy halls and purple temples, star gardens and cloud groves, dragon courts and phoenix gardens, floating in the void, flanking the sun and moon, dividing cities and arranging wards—myriad forms, a thousand names.

The *Scripture of the Divine Duke’s Inquiry* states: At that time, the Supreme Thearch’s Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis, the eight directions’ heavens, and the three thousand great thousand worlds—eastward, the Great Hall Precinct of the Great Thousand World of Gathering Goodness; southeast, the Primordial Blessed Field of the Great Thousand World of Employing Worthies; southward, the Boundless Benefit City of the Great Thousand World of Abandoning Worthies; southwest, the Extended Blessing Precinct of the Great Thousand World of Benevolent Stillness; westward, the Blessed Hall Province of the Great Thousand World of Flourishing Conduct; northwest, the Blessed Virtue Wilds of the Great Thousand World of Extending Worthies; northward, the Solitary Wilds of the Great Thousand World of Purity; northeast, the Blessed Assembly Capital of the Great Thousand World of Eternal Peace—all these worlds, with their multitudes of sages, are but the Supreme Thearch’s Jade Capital Mountain, the Void and Mysterious Metropolis, the Boundless Eight Directions’ heavens and earth.

The *Central Chapter Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning* states: The vast and resplendent terraces of Luo, the verdant silk of the great thousand. Lu Jianji explains: The “great thousand” refers to the divisions of worlds. One thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a thousand thousand lands form a small thousand world; one thousand thousand, ten thousand thousand, a hundred thousand thousand, a thousand thousand thousand form a middle thousand world; one thousand thousand thousand, ten thousand thousand thousand, a hundred thousand thousand thousand, a thousand thousand thousand thousand form a great thousand world.

**Chapter Four: Resplendent Abodes**

The *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Great Mysterious Metropolis* states: The Supreme Thearch declares: The Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis crowns the heavens of the Eight Directions and the earthly realms, standing at the supreme center of the highest extremity. The mountain bears a city of seven treasures, within which lies a palace of seven treasures, and within the palace, a terrace of seven treasures. The mountain naturally produces trees of seven treasures—each tree overspreading one heaven, and eight trees overspreading the heavens of the Eight Directions. Each of the Eight Directions possesses five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad layers of heavens, and the number of earthly realms is likewise.

The *Wondrous Scripture of the Authentic Writ of the Cavernous Mystery, on the Salvation of Humankind and the Fundamental Practices of the Dao* states: The Supreme Dao Lord, upon the Floating Rosary Peak of Yucha Mountain in the Western Heaven, sat beneath a seven-jeweled *qian* tree, fasting in the empty mountains and meditating upon the divine perfected.

The *Scripture of the Mysterious and Wondrous Inner Chapters* states: Within the borders of Wanli City stands Heaven’s Crown Mountain, upon which rise terraces of seven treasures, nine treasures, and ninety thousand tiers. The Lord Lao transformed within these terraces, emitting nine-colored radiance that illumined all heavens, earths, and worlds.

The *Authentic Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Above the Nine Heavens lies the Golden Lofty Palace.

The *Scripture of the Roots of Transgression* states: The Heavenly Worthy, at the Southern Crimson Cavern of Yangshang, expounded the Authentic Writ from the Cypress Mound Lodge to deliver gods and humans.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writ* states: The Heavenly Worthy, at the Lodge of the Knotted Essence in the Cavernous Mystery, inscribed golden characters, inscribing the four sides of the lodge.

The *Scripture of the Pure Lands* states: The Heavenly Worthy declares: In each of the ten directions’ pure land realms, there are the Lodge of Floating Clouds, the Lodge of the Great Dao, the Lodge of Offering Longevity, the Lodge of Myriad Longevities, the Lodge of Prosperous Joy, the Lodge of Vast Dao, the Lodge of the Utmost Perfected, the Lodge of Prosperous States, the Lodge of Initiating the Sacred, the Lodge of Assembling Spirits, the Lodge of Recommending Blessings, and the Lodge of Virtue and Dao.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Thearch’s Resolution of Doubts* states: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was upon the Towering Terrace of the Lodge of Harmonious Dawn, unfolding the wondrous gate with the Supreme Dao Lord.

The *Scripture of the Primordial Thearch’s Successive Transformations* states: The Supreme Heavenly Worthy, receiving the mandate of the Primordial Thearch, descended into the ten directions, dwelling in the Crimson Radiance Realm’s Vermilion Yang Upper Lodge within a seven-jeweled hall, spreading great compassion.

The *Lower Scripture of the Jade Characters* states: The Lodge of the Supreme Numinous is within the Brahma-Purity Heaven; the Lodge of the Controller of Spirits is within the Primordial Cavern Heaven; the Lodge of the Cavernous Yang is within the Harmonious Yang Heaven; the Lodge of the Stalwart Numinous is within the Northern Brilliance Heaven; the Purple Yang Lodge is within the Literary Ascension Heaven.

The *Lower Scripture of the Authentic Writ* states: South of the Lodge of the Primordial Yang lies the Vermilion Numinous of the Supreme Emperor. The Old Master often convened on the twenty-third day of each month at this lodge to review and adjust the lifespans of gods and humans.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Perfection* states: The Lodge of the Nine Numinous is on Kunlun Mountain, where the Queen Mother of the West and the perfected immortal women roam; the Lodge of the Grand Tenuity is the abode of the Emperor of the Grand Tenuity Heaven; the Lodge of the Plain Numinous is the dwelling of the Golden Mother of the Nine Numinous and the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Plain; the Lodge of the Pure Tenuity is where the Primordial Heavenly King congealed the soaring mysterious *qi* to traverse and chant the Three Heavens; the Lodge Above the Moon is where the Primordial Heavenly King issued *The Genealogical Records of August Personages*.

The *Scripture on the Causes and Conditions of Leaving the Household in the Numinous Treasure* states: The Dao declares: When the Three Luminaries of heaven and earth shift and revolve, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When the four seasons lose their balance and yin and yang fall into disorder, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When water, fire, blades, and weapons bring harm to the world, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When pestilence and poison spread and the people perish, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When the sovereign faces calamity and encounters misfortune, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When the state’s destiny is imperiled and warfare arises on all sides, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When first ascending the throne to govern the people, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When ruling the realm and the land is unsettled, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. When giving birth to sons and daughters who suffer illness and misfortune, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. For all calamities, misfortunes, and every peril and suffering, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. Whether for parents, oneself, wife and children, subjects, ancestors, the living, the deceased, or the Three Wretched Realms, one must establish lodges to deliver humankind. Establishing lodges to deliver humankind dissolves heavenly disasters above, stabilizes and secures the state’s destiny, and protects the sovereign. Below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the people. In life and death, one obtains blessings—its merit is towering, universally enabling all to find refuge.

The *Original Record of the Lodge of Multi-Storied Observatories* states: The Lodge of Multi-Storied Observatories was originally the dwelling of a grandee of King Kang of Zhou. The grandee was surnamed Yin, named Xi, styled Master Zhang, and hailed from Tianshui. Of refined and elegant spirit, he did not follow worldly rites. Gazing upon this land, he knew it would surely become a site of perfection. Thus, he wove grasses into a tower to observe the stars and await the *qi*. King Kang, hearing of this, ordered the construction of halls and chambers. Because he observed from a tower, this dwelling was named the Lodge of Multi-Storied Observatories.

The *Precepts and Regulations for the Three Caverns’ Observance of the Dao* states: In the supreme realms of the Three Clarities, the Ten Isles, the Five Marchmounts, and all famous mountains—or within cavern-heavens and the great void—there are always perfected beings dwelling. Some condense *qi* into towers, pavilions, halls, and palaces; some gather clouds into terraces, pavilions, and chambers; some reside between stars, sun, and moon; some dwell within mists, clouds, and auroras; some manifest naturally; some are constructed by divine power; some are cultivated over kalpas; some are established in an instant. Whether Penglai, Fangzhang, Yuanqiao, Yingzhou, Pingpu, Langfeng, Kunlun, or Xuanpu—or the Twelve Jade Towers, the Three Thousand Golden Palaces, the myriad names and thousand appellations—none can be fully enumerated. All are the transformative traces of the Heavenly Worthy and the Supreme Thearch, the governance of the perfected, immortals, and divine ranks, as recorded in the various scriptures, and thus not detailed further here.

To ensure that humans and devas alike revere them, and that the worthy and the foolish from distant lands may behold, these sacred precincts are established in emulation of the heavens above. As blessed realms, they are the abodes of immortals, their layouts and locations governed by distinct regulations. There are six types in all: first, those in mountain recesses; second, those within city walls; third, those in palace precincts; fourth, those in villages; fifth, those in secluded solitude; and sixth, those dependent on human patronage. All require the patronage of emperors and kings, the construction by ministers and officials, and the ordination of Daoist priests and nuns to reside within, maintain, and offer sustenance.

The *Zhengyi Jing* states: Above the Four Brahma Heavens, flying clouds and flowing auroras coalesce into wondrous *qi*, naturally forming garments of nine-colored radiant light that give rise to the myriad things. Their length and size adapt to their surroundings, assuming forms as needed. Some manifest the Eight Luminous Brilliances, their circular forms resplendent and dazzling, their radiance illuminating near and far, transforming effortlessly. Others combine nine hues, their brilliance suffusing the ten thousand things. Still others weave the patterns of dragons and phoenixes or the flowing shapes of mountains and rivers. Their transformations are boundless, defying all names. Even cities and towns, palaces and halls, towers and terraces, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, chariots and vessels, banners and canopies, seats and ritual implements—all arise naturally, appearing in response to conditions, inherently unobstructed, their concealment and revelation without constancy.

In the Formless Heavens, the sacred robes of immortals and perfected beings, the crowns of the Heavenly Thearchs, the flying-cloud treasure diadems, the seamless nine-colored capes, the azure-dragon embroidered skirts, the five-colored brocade sashes, the auspicious-luan jade sandals—all emerge spontaneously, arriving at the mere thought. Palaces and halls, towers and terraces, chariots and vessels, ornaments and attire, gardens and fruits, music and ritual implements—all necessities manifest in like manner.

The *Lingbao Chujiayuan Yinjing* states in its fifth chapter, "Illumination and Liberation": The Dao spoke: On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, at the Three Clarities Treasure Altar in the Vermilion Sun Upper Abbey of the Crimson Radiance Realm, I approached the Nameless Heavenly Worthy and received the supreme, three-cavern, Mahāyāna wondrous scriptures—13,500 scrolls—and 7,000 talismanic charts. At that assembly, twenty thousand kings, along with their consorts, ministers, and the men and women of their realms, all awakened to the Dao. Bowing to the Heavenly Worthy, they renounced their kingdoms, wives, and children to seek ordination, vowing to uphold the three-cavern scriptures, make lifelong offerings, and cultivate merit for the three times to come.

The text further states: The Heavenly Worthy then commanded the Perfected Officials of the Nine Earths to prepare the seats of the extended perfected, the Four Heavenly Kings to record the registers of the liberated immortals, and the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings to descend and affirm the covenants. Flowers were scattered, incense burned, banners unfurled, and pennants waved. Bells and chimes resounded as myriad celestial melodies filled the air, arrayed to left and right. The Heavenly Worthy instructed me and the Most High of Jade Clarity to confer upon the kings the precepts, disciplines, and dignified deportment of the ordained, while the Four Heavenly Kings bestowed the ritual vestments.

It also states: The halls and chambers, terraces and towers, fragrant oils and lamps, bells and chimes, and all ritual implements were offered in accordance with their abundance to sustain the Dharma-bodies of the ordained. Moreover, the men and women of the heavens and the people of the realm presented ten thousand kinds of flowers and fruits, rare and wondrous Dharma-delicacies, circulating them in due order. Upon completing the offerings, they dedicated the treasures of their storehouses—seven-jeweled pearls, silks and brocades, garments and bedding, ornaments and vessels, incense burners and whisk stands, ruyi scepters and staffs, dining utensils and seat cushions, rope beds and knee rests, banners and canopies, washing basins and towels, servants and carriages, gardens and estates, bamboo groves and fruit trees, flower gardens and medicinal pools—all manner of Dharma-requisites, bestowing them as offerings to the newly ordained.

It further states: The term *daoshi* (Daoist priest) refers to one whose every action—walking, standing, sitting, or reclining—is devoted solely to the Dao. They observe fasts, perform rites, uphold precepts, recite scriptures, burn incense, scatter flowers, light lamps, repent transgressions, make vows and aspirations, expound the Mahāyāna, instruct beings, awaken the great Dao-mind, and cultivate all meritorious deeds, universally benefiting all, placing others before themselves. Unsullied by worldly dust, they dedicate themselves solely to the work of the Dao.

The Dao declared: O all you men and women, it is better to flay the skins of five hundred people than to remove the robe of a single ordained one; better to slay ten thousand ordinary beings than to harm the Dharma-body of one ordained; better to provoke three thousand fierce beasts than to offend one ordained; better to humiliate five thousand warriors than to humiliate one ordained; better to slight ten thousand evil spirits than to slight one ordained; better to sit amidst a great fire than to share a seat with one ordained; better to lie upon a bed of scorching iron than to share a bed with one ordained; better to touch fifty thousand venomous snakes than to touch the robe of one ordained; better to reduce a great mountain to dust than to slander one ordained; better to swallow ten thousand measures of raging fire than to consume the belongings of one ordained; better to sink into a ten-thousand-fathom filth than to commit adultery with one ordained; better to spill the blood of a hundred people than to witness the faults of one ordained. Why is this so? The ordained are disciples of the Heavenly Worthy, upholders of the scriptural teachings, and the bridge across birth and death.

It further states: If emperors, kings, ministers, officials, or any man or woman among the people awakens a virtuous mind and leaves the household to enter the Dao, their nine generations of ancestors and parents will ascend to the heavenly palaces, and their seven generations of descendants will avoid the hells. If a Daoist priest widely encourages those with karmic affinity to ordain, each ordination extends their lifespan by 1,500 years. Three or more ordinations elevate one to the rank of immortality, bringing joy and abundance in this life, with clothing and sustenance naturally provided. In past lives, they ascend to heaven, their blessings boundless.

It further states: The term *daoshi* (Daoist) is composed of *dao* (Dao) and *shi* (one who serves). The extent of their service varies, and their learning leads to differing attainments. There are seven ranks, all called *daoshi*: first, the Heavenly Perfected, who embody natural harmony, inwardly and outwardly pure; second, the Divine Immortals, whose transformations are unfathomable, transcending the mundane realm; third, the Reclusive Sages, who conceal their brilliance, untethered by worldly burdens...

Fourth, the Mountain Dwellers, who withdraw in silent seclusion, finding peace through benevolence and wisdom; fifth, the Home-Leavers, who relinquish all attachments, shedding the dust of clamor; sixth, the Householders, who harmonize with the world while embracing the Dao and holding virtue; seventh, the Libationers, who humble themselves to descend among mortals, delivering beings from the suffering of form.

Thus, above the earth and below heaven, across the Six Paths and Four Modes of Birth, all bow in reverence, for they are the most exalted. They do not pay court to the Son of Heaven, nor do they bow to dukes and marquises. They create blessings for humans and gods, receiving offerings from the Three Realms.

Why is this so? Because they receive our teachings, don the robes of our Dharma, uphold the scriptures and precepts, and guide all beings—past, present, and future—so that they may forever escape sorrow and enter the gate of eternal joy.

The *San Dong Feng Dao Ke Jie* states: Daoists comprise six ranks, all transcendent beings. First, the Heavenly Perfected Daoists; second, the Divine Immortal Daoists; third, the Mountain-Dwelling Daoists; fourth, the Home-Leaving Daoists; fifth, the Householder Daoists; sixth, the Libationer Daoists.

The Heavenly Perfected Daoists are those whose bodies transform in harmony, merging with the primordial chaos of the natural Way. Their virtue rivals the Three Clarities, their wisdom encompasses all things—they are of the lineage of the Supreme Mystery’s August Ones.

The Divine Immortal Daoists have perfected their merit over countless kalpas, their virtue suffusing realms as numerous as grains of sand. Their spiritual transformations are boundless, soaring freely—they are of the rank of Du Chong and Yin Gui.

The Mountain-Dwelling Daoists embody non-action and desirelessness, guarding the Dao and preserving their essence. Their qi crowns the misty heavens, their minds settle in tranquil detachment—they are akin to Xu You and Chao Fu.

The Home-Leaving Daoists cast off the dust of the world, forsaking craving and envy. Their minds transcend all things, their spirits reign over the nine apertures. They escape the cage of the mundane, forever parting from wives and children—they are the peers of Song Lun and Peng Chen.

The Householder Daoists dwell in quiet obscurity, harmonizing with the world while their minds abide in the ultimate Dao. Their forms blend with humanity, yet they practice breath control in solitude, attaining carefree joy—they are of the lineage of Huang Qiong and Jian Keng.

The Libationer Daoists tread paths of emptiness and distance, their conduct serene and yielding. With compassion, they save others; with harmony, they nurture all things. Free from greed and desire, they renounce form and sound, their steadfast hearts devoted solely to the Dao.

*Ji* means to regulate; *jiu* means to harmonize. They regulate rigidity, harmonizing self and other—such are the likes of Li Dong and Gan Shi.

They are called Daoists because they renounce worldly affairs to cultivate the eternal Dao. All observe the dignified rites of the Dao, their hearts and conduct distinct from the vulgar. They propagate this mysterious transformation, spreading the imperial wind. Thus, they do not bow to kings and lords, offering only long salutations to the Son of Heaven.

Today’s Daoists are the Home-Leaving Daoists. They must remain loyal and reverent toward the sovereign. Before ministers, high officials, dukes, marquises, and regional governors, they must show respect with bows. They must not recklessly pursue power and profit. Those who violate this will have their lifespan reduced by 360 years.

*The Record of Louguan’s Origins* states: King Mu of Zhou revered the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Hearing of the immortal master Du Chong’s supreme virtue and lofty conduct, he took him as his teacher. Seeking to honor his legacy, the king erected a sacred altar and summoned recluses and scholars from all directions to perpetuate the mysterious enterprise, aligning their virtue with that of the sages Chao and Xu as models for the world. Thus, the Son of Heaven bowed to them without treating them as subjects, and the feudal lords honored them without conferring ranks. As they diligently cultivated the Dao’s affairs, the court and common folk bestowed upon them the title "Daoist."

When King Ping of Zhou relocated east to Luoyi, he ordained seven Daoists. Kings Zhao and Zhuang of Qin each ordained seven Daoists. Emperor Wen of Han particularly revered the Dao and its virtue, repeatedly summoning recluses and ordaining them as Daoists, maintaining a constant number of fourteen. Emperor Wu of Han, fond of immortals, appointed twenty-one Daoists. Emperor Wu of Jin held them in exceptional esteem, ordaining forty-nine Daoists.

*The Three Caverns’ Codes and Precepts for Upholding the Dao* states:
- **Zhengyi Dharma Masters** wear a dark cap, yellow lower garment, and crimson-brown robe with twenty-four pleats.
- **Gaoxuan Dharma Masters** wear a dark cap and yellow lower garment with twenty-eight pleats.
- **Dongshen Dharma Masters** wear a dark cap, yellow lower garment, and blue-brown robe with thirty-two pleats.
- **Dongxuan Dharma Masters** wear a lotus crown and brown robe with thirty-two pleats.
- **Dongzhen Dharma Masters** wear the Yuanshi crown, blue skirt, purple-brown robe with blue lining—twenty-four pleats on the outer layer and fifteen on the inner.
- **Dadong Dharma Masters** wear the Yuanshi crown, yellow skirt, and purple-brown robe as in the Shangqing tradition, with a five-colored cloud-and-mist mantle.
- **Sandong Dharma Lecturers** wear the Yuanshi crown, brown robe, and nine-colored cloud-and-mist mantle.

Daoists and female Daoist masters who do not prepare these ritual garments may not handle the sacred scriptures. When properly attired in their dharma robes, divine youths stand guard:
- **Zhengyi ritual robes** are attended by five generals and eight warrior spirits.
- **Gaoxuan ritual robes** are attended by two divine boys and two divine girls.
- **Dongshen ritual robes** are attended by five heavenly boys and five heavenly girls.
- **Dongxuan ritual robes** are attended by eight jade boys and eight jade girls.
- **Dongzhen, Dadong, and Sandong ritual robes** are attended by twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls.

These are collectively called *fafu* (dharma robes). Those who violate this will cause their attendant youths to withdraw, and the Four Controllers will examine one of their souls, deducting 2,400 years from their lifespan.

The code states: All Daoists and female Daoist masters who wish to study the scriptures must prepare their ritual garments in advance. After completing the fast, transmission, and dharma rank rituals, they must don their ritual caps and robes, hold their tablets, state their names and ranks, bow to their original master, and pay homage to the Most High. Those who violate this will find the spirit officials unwilling to attach to their bodies, and the Five Emperors will examine their souls, deducting 1,200 years from their lifespan.

*The Zhengyi Scripture* states: The Most High said: Daoists’ ritual robes comprise seven types:
1. For those newly entering the Dao’s gate: a plain cap and yellow mantle.
2. **Zhengyi**: a lotus dark cap, yellow skirt, and crimson-brown robe.
3. **Daode**: a brown robe and dark headscarf.
4. **Dongshen**: a dark cap and blue-brown robe.
5. **Dongxuan**: a brown robe and dark cap, both with yellow skirts, the cap shaped like a lotus.
6. **Dongzhen**: brown robes and mantles in purple, lined with blue, and a lotus jewel crown. Women’s robes use purple gauze, and their crowns are adorned with flying clouds and phoenix qi.
7. **Sandong Dharma Lecturers**: attire as in the Shangqing tradition, with the addition of a nine-colored cloud-and-mist, mountain-and-water patchwork mantle, Yuanshi jewel crown, jade pendants, tablets, and lion-patterned shoes.

These are called *fafu* (dharma robes). *Clarifying the Scriptural Dharma, Section Six.*

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writings of the Celestial Worthies* states:

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: In the era of Dragon Han, when I was formless, I resolved to emerge and teach transformation. At that time, heaven and earth existed, the sun and moon shone with radiance, and the Three Symbols were complete. There were men and women, birth and death. Though yin and yang were present, there were no rites or canons, nor the five flavors or garments and robes—all arose in primordial chaos. Through the transforming power of the Dao, they gradually awakened, came to know and practice benevolence and righteousness, and turned their hearts in faith and devotion. In that age, lifespans were long and enduring; those who did not believe in the Dharma perished swiftly.

After my departure, heaven and earth collapsed. Within them, all was vast and dim, lightless for kalpas uncounted—dark, obscure, and boundless in chaos. This was called the *Yan Kang* era. When the Crimson Brilliance dawned and light returned, heaven and earth were restored. I emerged once more, known as the Nameless Lord, teaching with the *Lingbao* scriptures to deliver the celestial and human realms. At that time, men and women who wholeheartedly received and upheld the scriptures and precepts all attained the true Dao, their bones and flesh ascending together. Even those who had not yet attained the Dao enjoyed long lifespans; though they died, they ascended to celestial halls, their wheel-turning undiminished. Later, all became immortals.

After my departure, when one kalpa had passed, heaven and earth were again destroyed, and light vanished once more. For five kalpas, all was dark and obscure. The Three Qi intermingled in chaos, borne by the turning of fate. When the *Kai Huang* era arrived, the *True Writ of Lingbao* opened the Three Symbols, and heaven and earth were restored. Within the Primordial Azure, I was known as the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. I unfolded the Dharma teachings, perfected the myriad heavens, widely bestowed scriptures, exhorted and admonished the ignorant and deluded, guiding them to turn their hearts in faith and devotion, gradually entering the Dharma gate.

It is further said: At that time, the Heavenly Worthy emitted a five-colored radiance from his mouth, universally illuminating the heavens. In all directions and borderlands, light was seen. The Heavenly Worthy divided his form into a million, appearing simultaneously everywhere. Whether man or woman, all saw the Heavenly Worthy within the five-colored light, as if in one place. Adapting to each land, the Heavenly Worthy uttered the *Five Chapters of the True Writ of Lingbao* from his mouth, expounded the Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures, conferred prohibitions and precepts, and proclaimed them to men and women. At that time, none failed to turn their hearts in devotion. Each brought gold, silver, brocade, five-colored patterned silks, pearls, jades, and treasures beyond count, offering them to the Heavenly Worthy and prostrating to receive the Dharma admonitions. The treasures of all lands filled the realm.

The Heavenly Worthy distributed them all at once to the destitute. The poor were sated, the wealthy did not want, and poverty and wealth became equal—none bore resentment in their hearts. Those who had previously accumulated merit, their names recorded in the registers, all attained deliverance from the world, soaring through the great void. Those newly entering the Dharma gate universally enjoyed lifespans of thirty-six thousand years.

By the first year of the *Shang Huang* era, the hearts of celestial men and women gradually grew lax and corrupted, and the true teaching was no longer whole. Therefore, I manifested in every land, perfecting the hearts of all. After my departure, within half a kalpa, the men and women of future generations will see their hearts corrupted. They will not believe in the scriptural teachings, creating their own Dharma, showing no reverence for heaven and earth, and slighting the divine spirits. Whether man or woman, they will indulge in sensual desires, bringing harm upon themselves, their bodies entering evil destinies, revolving endlessly through the Three Wretched Paths and the Five Realms.

Now I expound this scripture for the sake of all sentient beings, to deliver those of good heart.

The *Comprehensive Gazetteer of the Earth* states:

When Laozi crossed the Flowing Sands to transform the Hu barbarians, he first arrived in Khotan. The king asked, "What old man is this?" Laozi replied, "I am the Buddha-King." The king said, "If you claim to be Buddha, what virtue or power do you possess?" Thereupon, Laozi expounded the *Futu Sutra* to teach and transform the Hu people.

Huangfu Mi’s *Lives of Eminent Recluses* states: Yin Xi departed together with Laozi, journeying to the Western Rong tribes beyond the Flowing Sands. There, he transformed the Rong customs with the Dao, composing the *Futu Sutra*, and none knew where he ultimately went.

The *Scripture of the Golden Radiance of the Feathered Chapters* states: The Later Sage, the Ninefold Mysterious Emperor of the Golden Portal, descended to become the Preceptor of Zhou and changed his title to Laozi. He bestowed the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Heavens* upon King You. King You, believing himself to dwell in the course of spontaneity, to succeed the qi of the Five Emperors, and to master the principles of yin and yang, failed to revere the patterns of heaven. Laozi, knowing the decline of Zhou, withdrew the writ and departed, composing teachings to transform the age. Encountering the Pass Keeper Yin Xi, he then composed the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* in two scrolls in the land of Lǜnà. Laozi opened his mouth, and the hidden writ issued forth to be transmitted to Xi. Xi received it in accordance with their covenant, then summoned the eightfold cloud chariot, and together they roamed the eight directions, refining their bodies within the Great Void. A radiant jewel-like light arose from their necks, and the seventy-two marks illuminated their forms. Following the transformations of the cosmos, they ascended into the Eight Heavens. Their Dao was lofty and wondrous, beyond all description. For all later learners who do not obtain this writ, they should cease their distant yearnings and not waste their spirit in secluded mountains.

The *Scripture of the Melodic Phrases of the Curved Essence* states: Such are the *Phoenix Writs of the Nine Heavens*, all formed from the spontaneous qi of the Nine Heavens. The numinous writs manifested their marvels within the Void Mystery. After ninety thousand kalpas, the Vast Master of the Mysterious Capital received them from the Great Void and transmitted them to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure and Numinous Writs* states: The Heavenly Worthy said: "I have surveyed all the heavens, from kalpas beyond reckoning down to the present day. The exalted sages, great spirits, and all the perfected transcendents of the heavens—those of the Three Clarities, the Nine Palaces, and the Five Marchmounts—all received deliverance and attained perfection through the Numinous Treasure."

The *Scripture of the Golden Register of the Numinous Treasure: The Three Primes’ Dignified Observances and Spontaneous Perfection* states: In the first year of the High Emperor, on the first day of the ninth month, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao journeyed west to the Jade Land within the Dragon-Curved Mountains. Suddenly, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning arrived riding a floating cloud of azure radiance, preceded by phoenix songs and followed by the music of heaven. The Five Elders cleared the path, and the Great Ultimate harnessed the chariot, while all the perfected descended together into the Dragon-Curved Mountains. At that time, the heavens were bright and the qi clear; the sun and moon paused in their courses. The Five Sufferings were released, and the long night opened the souls. For a day and a night, mountains, rivers, streams, and valleys all became level. The Celestial Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao: "Today, seated for a kalpa, our joy is beyond words. All this is the accumulation of past blessings, the resonance of virtue, and the devotion of faith, enabling one to attain the perfection of the Dao. You have received the title of High Emperor and the charge of the Most High. Today, we celebrate together, our joy boundless. Yet I pity those of future lives who may not receive this teaching." Thereupon, the Lord of the Dao descended from his seat, bowed deeply, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "I humbly beseech your compassion to bestow what has never been heard." The Celestial Worthy replied: "The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* is the Dao of mysterious ascent, delivering the Seven Mysteries and bestowing blessings upon all lineages. The *Great Vehicle of the Numinous Treasure* universally delivers heaven and humanity, granting grace to the living and the dead. The *August Writ of the Imperial Script* communicates with spirits and brings forth numinosity. The Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures and the spontaneous celestial writs are all methods for delivering people and ascending to the Mystery. Those who cultivate them will gallop in dragon chariots and ascend to the dawn in broad daylight. Those who uphold them will be spared all suffering and calamity, and their seven generations of ancestors will be reborn in heaven."

Those who behold it with sincere faith will cultivate good affinities life after life. Now you must admonish and instruct the three generations, select true persons, prepare the celestial rites, and teach the Three Vehicles, so that those with aspiration may attain to the divine immortals.

Today I shall bestow upon you the *Numinous Treasure Golden Register: Simplified Writ of the Three Primes and the Spontaneous Rites of Majestic Power True Scripture*. This method is most exalted and subtle; it must not be lightly transmitted.

The Dao Lord bowed his head, receiving the precept with reverence.

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy commanded the Jade Youth Attendant of the Scriptures to stand on the left, and the Inspector of Deliverance, Sima, to stand on the right. The Nine Heavens’ True Kings circled thrice with their nine-colored standards, while the myriad heavens oversaw the deliverance. The Dao Lord turned left and stood facing south, while the Celestial Worthy turned left and stood facing north. The Jade Youth Attendant of the Scriptures invoked the numinous in accordance with the truth, and the Inspector of Deliverance, Sima, held the scripture before him. The Dao Lord bowed nine times, rising and prostrating thrice, and received the *Spontaneous Rites of Majestic Power True Scripture*.

The *Primordial Red Writ of the True Writ Upper Scripture* states: At that time, the Supreme Saintly Great Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Divine Immortals of the Five Thearchs, the Thousand Perfected of the Mulberry Grove, the White Cranes of the Lion Forest, the Tigers, Leopards, Dragons, and Unicorns—celestial maidens scattered flowers, golden lads wafted incense, the Five Elders opened the path, and the Three Realms’ thoroughfares were unobstructed. They roamed the cloud roads, whistling to summon the ten directions, ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mystery Jade Capital, the Cold Numinous Cinnabar Palace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace. Donning celestial treasure-feathered robes, they approached the Golden Watchtower of the Primordial Celestial Worthy and entreated the *Primordial Numinous Treasure Red Writ of the Five Chapters True Writ*.

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy commanded the assembly of perfected beings to enter the Ninefold Radiance Chamber of the Jade Treasure Palace in the Golden Terrace of the Great Void. Jade maidens and numinous youths attended to their left and right; ninety million flying dragons and poisonous beasts guarded the eight gates, coiling serpents struck swords, long-fanged beasts struck bells, divine tigers roared upward, lions roared downward, unicorns danced, phoenixes sang, and their harmonious cries resounded. The celestial music played upon their banners and canopies, while jade tones rang through the cloud courts.

The Supreme Five Elders and the Great Dao Lord bowed their heads and said: We have heard that when the Primordial transformed the kalpa, the mysterious signs unfolded in diagrams, and the numinous writ flourished, its divine forms manifesting in the five directions. Heaven and earth relied upon it to separate and take form; the Three Luminaries followed it to shine forth. This is the great ancestral enterprise—might we briefly glimpse its numinous treasury? We do not yet know whether the *Numinous Treasure Five Chapters Jade Writ* may be seen and taught to those who have not yet heard of it.

The Primordial Celestial Worthy, absorbed in distant contemplation, struck the table and raised his voice, summoning the Five Thearchs to discuss and settle yin and yang. For all time, he would not deign to hear their entreaties, closing the gates to the path of seeking the true.

The Great Dao Lord persisted in his inquiry, until at last the Primordial Celestial Worthy deigned to glance at him and, sighing deeply, said: What you now ask is not a small matter. For now, it may be entrusted to you, to be recorded in the Upper Palace, though it must not yet circulate in the lower world. The teachings for beginning students have their own regulations; they must not be transmitted lightly. You yourself may go to the Numinous Capital’s Upper Palace and receive instruction from the divine kings.

Thereupon, the Great Dao Lord and the assembly of perfected beings retreated to fast for three months, then returned to consult the Primordial Celestial Worthy on the rites of prohibitions and precepts. Humbly acknowledging their inadequacy, they received the Celestial Worthy’s compassionate instruction. The numinous gates opened wide, and he commanded the Five Elders and Upper Perfected to unseal the ninefold radiance and eight-colored treasury, the cloud-brocade satchel, and bring forth the *Primordial Red Writ of the Five Chapters True Writ Numinous Treasure Upper Scripture*, bestowing it upon the Great Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, instructing them to transmit it in accordance with the mysterious regulations and methods.

The *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Great Mystery Capital* states: Zheng Siyuan at that time recounted the words of his former teacher, the Immortal Duke, saying: The *Upper Clarity Three Caverns Great Perfection Dao Scripture* that I received—on the day of my departure from this world, one copy shall be sealed in a grotto-chamber of a famous mountain, one copy transmitted to my disciples, and one copy entrusted to my family’s descendants, to be transmitted through the generations to those of true attainment. If one merely pursues these scriptures while chasing worldly affairs, one will be unworthy of their transmission; they may all be entrusted to the famous mountains and Five Peaks, and must not be lightly transmitted to the unworthy. If one finds a worthy recipient, they should be transmitted, lest the great Dharma be closed off.

The *Numinous Treasure True Writ: Scripture on Delivering People and the Fundamental Practices* states: The Primordial Five Elders did not become perfected through later study. They lodged in the womb and were conceived, born among humankind, or refined and transformed through water and fire. They did so to follow the world’s transformations, revolving through karmic conditions, progressing from the coarse to the subtle, exhorting and admonishing students to apply themselves diligently. All later saints—the Four Poles’ True Persons, Immortal Dukes, Immortal Kings, the flying immortals of the Five Peaks and Nine Palaces, divine immortals, earthbound immortals, and their countless numbers—are those who, through later study, accumulated merit to attain their state. Some were born with deep devotion, established great merit, bestowed kindness and spread virtue, cultivated and upheld the scriptures and precepts, their meritorious names resounding to heaven, thereby becoming true persons. Others, through blessings from past lives flowing into the present, or through karmic conditions and past destinies, attained to divine immortality. All such students received the great scriptural teachings and made offerings to the Three Treasures. Some soared through the world, traversing the empty void; others received their reward in future lives. Some enjoyed wealth and nobility in royal households, while others underwent liberation in the flesh, gradually becoming immortals. According to the weight of their merit, none failed to receive their due—all was the result of their cultivation and study.

The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* states: Those who aspire to study but whose strength is not yet sufficient will fail through excessive knowledge and bring misfortune through laziness. Good teachers illuminate what their students are capable of, gradually reducing the teachings according to their capacity. Thus, the essential instructions of the many scriptures and methods are cultivated step by step, and when merit and virtue are accomplished, all will naturally be mastered—all begins with the essentials. The essentials are three: the first is called *cause*.

From the beginningless past until now, there has always been the nature of consciousness, which is indestructible in its spiritual essence. The suffering of death remains, while the joy of life is but fleeting—all because one fails to recognize *cause*.

Those who recognize *cause* will surely neither resent Heaven, nor blame others, nor fault things, nor lament the body. They accept suffering and joy alike with equanimity, free from delusion and confusion.

The second is called *condition*.

Following *cause* in movement and stillness, harmonizing inner and outer, one neither encroaches upon others to benefit oneself nor harms oneself to mislead others. Though diminished, one suffers no injury; though profited, one brings no harm. Recognizing the root and knowing the branch, one remains free from perverse doubt.

The third is called *diligence*.

With vigilance in heart and speech, and strict discipline of body and spirit, one seeks the sagely, inquires earnestly, and receives teachings with reverence. One expands good conditions, severs evil causes, and perceives the right view with clarity. Unwavering in progress, one delivers others and aids oneself, transcends the mundane to attain the numinous, refines the coarse into the refined, accumulates merit and virtue, and ascends to the realm of the sagely and perfected.

The *Virtue Scripture* of Lord Lao states:
The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.
Cultivating it in the self, their virtue becomes true;
cultivating it in the family, their virtue overflows;
cultivating it in the village, their virtue endures;
cultivating it in the state, their virtue abounds;
cultivating it throughout the world, their virtue becomes universal.

The *Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain* states:
All begins with fasting and precepts,
accumulating merit and binding past conditions.
Soaring through the Great Void,
one is uplifted to the loftiest immortals.

It also says:
Through accumulated study, one becomes a perfected person,
serene and harmonious in *qi* and vitality.
Enjoying boundless life,
what are ten thousand kalpas to such as these?

The *Scripture of Stabilizing Aspiration* states:
The practice of immortal study is urgent;
observe precepts and restrain the heart’s passions.

It also says:
The great worthies delight in scriptures and precepts,
receiving them as treasures for the self.
They lament the lateness of their studies,
regretting not having cultivated themselves sooner.
When at last they unravel the profound and obscure,
suddenly, their years have grown old.
Clutching the scrolls, they sigh in exhaustion,
only to face death with bitter remorse.
Thus, in my youth, I abandoned the world to study the Dao.

The *Scripture of Lord Lao’s Western Ascent* states:
Lord Lao said: One must hold to the source of supreme wisdom,
for wisdom does not arise alone.
All depends on *cause* and *condition*,
each with its own past roots,
linked to destiny and fortune.
Those who share the Dao attain the Dao;
those who share virtue have virtue’s root.
Those who in past lives did not study
now drift far from their true kin.
Without a bright teacher,
how can one resolve doubts and difficulties?
My Dao is like a single hair—
who can truly discern its measure?
From the earliest ages until now,
the experiences passed through are like grains of sand.
Each movement spans kalpas,
and I reflect on my own arduous toil.
I studied what is beyond study,
and thus came to understand the natural.
You should not cling to appearances,
nor be bound by what seems substantial.

The *Lower Scripture of Jade Characters* states:
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign bowed and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:
Since receiving the sun and moon,
I have drifted with the turning of fate,
passing through cycles of coming and going,
alternating between light and darkness,
between extinction and renewal,
between death and life.
The body undergoes destruction,
now ruined, now restored;
traversing heaven and earth,
exchanging brightness for obscurity.
Vast and distant, beyond thought or discourse—
since the Dragon Han era,
through ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety thousand kalpas,
conditions and encounters have intertwined,
lifetimes unbroken, until this very day.
I have been born in royal households,
and in humble homes;
in wealthy chambers,
and in poverty and cold.
I have been honored as a person,
and served as a menial;
afflicted by the six illnesses,
and blessed with radiance;
endowed with wisdom,
and stricken with ignorance and deafness.
I have experienced all manner of deeds,
moral *cause* and *condition*,
offerings to scriptures and dharma,
seven treasures presented to the numinous,
vows of goodness made,
and merit and fame fulfilled.
Praised by the Three Realms,
illumined by the Five Emperors,
I was sent cloud chariots,
eight-jewel jade wheels,
riding the void, ascending the floating,
rising at dawn to the morning light.
I received the Heavenly Worthy’s grace,
a profound kindness bestowed.
My decayed form was adorned,
and I beheld the light.
Transcending the Three Realms,
I ascended to the rank of Heavenly Perfected.
Today, seated in attendance,
joy beyond words.

The *Scripture of Karmic Retribution and Conditions* states:
The Most High addressed Universal Salvation, saying:
In the beginning of the Red Clarity Kalpa,
at the Fire-Refining Pool beside the Open Yang Observatory in the Southern Vermilion Grotto,
I convened a great assembly with the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning to expound the dharma,
widely delivering the hosts of heaven.
At that time, the Four Brahma Heavenly Kings,
leading their retinues of countless beings from myriad lands,
held fragrant flowers and made offerings,
listening to the dharma, each stationed at one direction.
The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning,
moved by these *conditions*,
emitted from between his brows ten kinds of radiant lights,
illuminating the boundless lands of the ten directions,
enabling all to hear and know.
To the east, ten dharma thrones were established,
adorned with a hundred treasures;
to the south, ten dharma thrones,
adorned with ten thousand kinds of ornaments;
to the west, ten dharma thrones,
adorned with seven treasures;
to the north, ten dharma thrones,
adorned with five colors;
to the northeast, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with azure jade;
to the southeast, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with red jewels;
to the southwest, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with pale jade;
to the northwest, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with various treasures;
in the world above, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with ten thousand treasures;
in the world below, ten dharma thrones,
all adorned with yellow jade.
Ten thousand golden lamps shone,
a thousand jade candles gleamed,
countless in number,
brilliant before all.
Ten heavens arrayed in order,
a hundred thrones resplendent,
inner and outer radiance
illuminating heaven and earth.

The *Scripture of the Origins of Leaving the Household in the Numinous Treasure* states:
Reciting the revered scriptures,
prostrating, burning incense,
observing fasts and upholding precepts,
establishing hundred-jeweled thrones,
inviting the exposition of the Great Vehicle,
constantly serving as fields of blessing for the Three Times
to the lords of nations, kings, and great ministers.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Numinous Treasure* states:
In the Vermilion Palace of Southern Ling,
within the Hall of Ninefold Numinous Blessings,
all offerings to the Numinous Treasure,
the practice of fasts and precepts—
this scripture is most revered and wondrous,
delivering countless beings.
When great kalpas turn and end,
heaven collapses and earth sinks,
the four seas merge into darkness,
gold and jade dissolve and vanish,
the power of the myriad ways ceases—
yet this scripture alone endures,
its dharma unbroken.

All miscellaneous methods, arts of transformation, scriptures of change, and scattered folk techniques belong to the Six Heavens within the Realm of Desire. When a minor kalpa arrives, these teachings all perish, leaving no remnant.

The *Taiqing* miscellaneous talismans and diagrams, along with the *Scriptures of the Dao of Great Peace*, circulate throughout the eighteen heavens above and below within the Realm of Form. When the great kalpa turns, heaven and earth transform their measures—yet these texts still serve, leaving no remnant behind.

The supreme scriptures of the Jade Purity—*The Three Caverns’ Divine Scriptures*, *The Tiger Script of Divine Perfection*, *The Golden Writ and Jade Characters*, and *The True Scripture of the Numinous Treasure*—all issue from the Primordial Beginning, dwelling above the twenty-eight heavens in the Realm Beyond Form. When the great kalpa completes its cycle, these texts return to the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace of Jade Capital Mountain in the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, untouched by calamity.

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: *The Ten Sections of the Wondrous True Writ of the Numinous Treasure* are secrets of the Most High, not fully transmitted to the world. Even the Five Sacred Peaks hold incomplete versions. In the Western Chamber of Tortoise Mountain and the Southern Shrine of Wangwu, the celestial scriptures are complete, yet they open but once in ten thousand kalpas. Thus, there is hope for those who await—one must diligently cultivate devotion through prolonged fasting and supplication, awaiting the true advent. When the great cycle turns, one may then fully receive the celestial rites.

The *Catalogue of the Ever-Abiding Guardian Scriptures* states: The thirty-six divisions of the Three Caverns’ true scriptures total two million six hundred twenty-eight thousand two hundred twenty scrolls, hidden within the Three Purities’ realm, upon the Mystic Terrace, and in the Three Palaces of the Great Purple Tenuity and Supreme Ultimate. They shine resplendent, each attended by thirty million divine youths and jade maidens who constantly burn incense and scatter flowers.

The *Chart of the Hidden Stems’ Mountain-Opening* records: In thirty-two sacred mountain grottoes, scriptures of the Dao are stored. Nineteen chambers hold one million six hundred ninety-five thousand eight hundred thirty-one scrolls. Six chambers contain fifteen thousand two hundred three texts, unnumbered by scrolls. Another six chambers list only titles, without scroll counts. One chamber holds rare and wondrous scriptures and diagrams—manifestations of the Yellow Emperor’s decrees, the writings of the River Chart and Luo Scripture—beyond reckoning.

The *Supreme Purity’s Primordial Record of the Granary* states: The teachings comprise three vehicles, each with twelve matters. The upper, middle, and lower grades of the three vehicles’ precepts and scriptures number twelve each, totaling thirty-six divisions.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Causes for Leaving the Household* states: The Dao declares: In the first year of the Kaihuang era, I journeyed to the Venerable Heavenly Worthy of the Nameless to receive thirteen thousand five hundred chapters of the supreme Three Caverns’ Great Vehicle’s wondrous scriptures, along with seven thousand talismans.

The *Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens* states: Suddenly, a celestial writ appeared, each character a pace in length, manifesting naturally in the void. Its radiance blazed, eight-cornered rays dazzling the eyes, its splendor too brilliant to behold.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Tenuity* states: The Three August Celestial Worthies concealed the eightfold writings in Mount Weiyu. The Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven hid one copy in Tortoise Mountain.

The *Scriptures of the Three August Ones* state: The natural writings of the Three August Ones were all inscribed on gold and jade. The Heavenly August One’s writ was on dark jade slips, with azure jade characters. The Earthly August One’s writ was on yellow jade slips, with white jade characters. The Human August One’s writ was on red jade slips, with yellow jade characters. They were bound with golden hooks, linked with golden chains, borne on jade stands, covered with pearl veils, perfumed with five fragrances, and attended by ten kinds of flowers. Jade youths and maidens wielded fly-whisks at their sides. Divine officials and immortal officers oversaw the sacred writs. Apotropaic beasts—lions, qilin, phoenixes, Azure Dragons, White Tigers, Dark Warriors, Vermilion Birds—along with countless spirit birds and sacred beasts, and boundless musicians, accompanied the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, the Three and Five Attendants, all guarding and protecting, serving these texts.

The *Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Writ of the Supreme Purity’s Mystic Empyrean* states: *The Scripture of the Purple Ascension’s Blazing Radiance and Divine Mystery* did not originate from the Purple Ascension’s Blazing Radiance. Rather, it is a divine scripture born spontaneously in the empty void, its chapters congealed from qi, its radiance blazing with mystic light. After seven thousand years, its text became visible. The Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity inscribed its titles on purple slips and its main text on golden slips, naming it *The Scripture of the Purple Ascension’s Blazing Radiance and Divine Mystery*.

The *Canons of the Supreme Purity and Great Perfection* state: Engraving and illumination to attain the Dao depend upon the scriptures. Scriptures, diagrams, canons, and precepts must not be misrepresented. They are to be copied, quintuply proofread, expounded, and practiced. The celestial patterns of beginning and end each have their own scriptures. In broad reckoning, their number is beyond measure. Here, we consider but one. The essential texts within and beyond the world, selected for urgent use, are also innumerable. From the time of the world’s opening to the kalpa’s end, China holds one hundred twenty-three thousand scrolls, while the four barbarian regions each possess eighty-four thousand scrolls—beyond these, the scrolls have no fixed count. From the Three August Ones to the Three Dynasties, the Most High Lord Lao served as master, appearing in the world to transform beings. His essential teachings numbered thirteen thousand scrolls, all belonging to the inner mysteries. All true scriptures coalesce from the void into characters. When sagely masters emerge to transform the world, they transcribe them for circulation. Jade tablets and golden books use seven treasures as slips. Later ages substitute bamboo, wood, silk, and paper for the ancient scriptures. The original catalogue’s full count resides in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Supreme Mystery Metropolis. Other places hold partial transmissions, each varying in extent. Though the original count may be incomplete, it is still sufficient for attaining the Dao. Incompleteness makes the Dao harder to attain; completeness makes it easier. Here ends the account of the origins and wondrous gates of all Daoist scriptures’ sounds and meanings.
