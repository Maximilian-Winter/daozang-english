### *The Supreme Heaven’s Performance of the Celestial Model True Scripture*

#### **Chapter on Gathering Virtue, Accord with Heaven, and Treading the Dao (Part One)**
What is above me, I honor with loyalty and filial piety.
What is below me, I cherish with kindness and humility.
In action and repose, I temper with gentleness;
In conduct and concealment, I uphold with benevolence and righteousness.
I forgive others before myself,
And reflect upon myself beyond my own form.
Toward the ten thousand beings, I extend skillful means and goodness.
Within and without, I align with the center and embody virtue.
One who can persist thus abides in the Dao and follows its flow.

#### **Chapter on Embodying the Dao, Nurturing the Spirit, and Attaining Supreme Virtue (Part Two)**
Forms with appearance are not the true form.
The spirit of the primordial spirit is the daily true spirit.
The sageliness of the spirit resides in the realm of clarity, awareness, tranquility, and wisdom.
The dullness of the spirit dwells in the domain of fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow.
If one can shatter these appearances with form and realize the spirit of the primordial spirit,
Then the Dao of longevity and enduring vision is near at hand.

#### **Chapter on the Illumination of the Two Aspects and the Principles of Clarity (Part Three)**
Without the true spirit, it is but a ghost in name.
The true spirit assists the primordial spirit, embracing yang to become an immortal.
The true is the essence of the primordial unity,
Employed in service to the spirit.
The spirit is the origin of the primordial beginning,
Perfected through the essence.
Profound indeed! To awaken from the dream of conditioned existence
And return to the body of the primordial aspect,
Is to attain the unfathomable numinous radiance,
And become the very vessel of the sage.

The Perfected of Purple Clarity composed a gatha:
The Dao’s lineage is without action,
Awakening arises from the mind’s conduct.
Vast and boundless, the light of the clear heavens,
All obstructions are cast away.
The true assists the primordial soul,
Refined and congealed, it merges with the empty firmament.
When the spirit dwells in the root of the conditioned,
It attains the unconditioned achievement.
