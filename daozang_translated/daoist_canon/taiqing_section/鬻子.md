**The Presentation of the *Jìn Yù Zhǐzǐ* (進鬻子表) –** Your humble subject, Xíng Guī, speaks:

I have heard that before the invention of knotted cords, records were sparse and indistinct;
When writing first emerged, its teachings and principles arose.
The establishment of historians to record speech gave rise to the traces of praise and blame;
The appointment of officials to document affairs opened the door to admonition and exhortation.
Thus, the state’s inscriptions multiplied, their edicts and instructions became clear,
And the Dao of chanting and elucidating was expanded, while the principles of explanation were made manifest.
Virtue and deeds grew ever more refined, brilliance and wisdom renewed daily,
As character was polished and its luminous essence was roused.

When the **Dao-Symbols** (道符) of **Zhōu Wén** (周文) became the **#1 Saint** (聖),
And **Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子) was hailed as an **exemplary sage** (稱賢),
Their intentions aligned with the **Dao/Way** (道), their substance harmonized,
They truly **#2 fulfilled the role of the Master** (實#2申師傅).
**Yù Zhǐzǐ** (鬻子), upon **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) descent to him,
Greatly opened his heart and mind,
Illuminated the methods of promulgating governance,
And broadly established strategies of support and completion,
Enabling the myriad affairs of state to be contemplated,
And ensuring the prosperity of an entire age.
He revered antiquity with sincerity,
And revealed truths to sharpen perception and understanding.

Examining his recorded doctrines and exploring his admonishing words,
One finds that he **rooted his teachings in the Dao/Way** (原道心以裁章),
And **delved into the divine principles** (研神理) to awaken and nourish.
He **wove together** (弥纶) the **ancestral instructions** (彝训),
And **structured the world with his teachings** (经纬区中),
Not merely praising and explaining subtle truths,
But earnestly **passing down his legacy** (务於遗翰) for future generations.

The **Zhāi Xióng** (斋熊) was the first among the **Master’s disciples** (诸子之首),
And **Wén Wáng** (文王) was the **founder of saintly virtue** (聖德之宗).
Since **Xióng** (熊) was **Wén Wáng’s** (文王) teacher,
And the **Book** (书) is the **embodiment of governance and instruction** (政教之体),
Though its chapters may be fragmentary and incomplete,
Its **essential framework and principles remain intact** (提举犹备纪纲),
Like a **vessel of jade** (譬彼盘盂),
Its **exposition surpasses the original** (发扬有愈).

My family has long been devoted to **Confucian learning** (传儒素),
With deep-rooted habits of loyalty and integrity.
Seeing the **traces of a sage ruler revering his teacher** (明主奉师之踪),
And observing the **path of the worthy fulfilling their duty** (贤者尽义之道),
I have **followed and investigated** (循环征究),
And **penetrated the profound mysteries** (妙极机神).

Though I am the most humble and foolish of scholars,
I dare to compose **annotations and elucidations** (注解),
To **delve deeply and analyze principles** (研覃析理),
And **express my personal reverence** (以叔私情),
To **trim away superfluous words** (剪截浮辞),
And **reiterate the teachings of the blind and deaf** (用申狂瞽).

I humbly pray that Your Majesty,
**Follows Heaven’s model and issues sage instructions** (則天垂训),
**Surpasses the extremes and spreads the imperial winds** (越极宣风),
**Reveres the supreme harmony of the Ancestor** (稽太上之至和),
And **awakens the bright admonitions of the sovereign** (興帝王之炯诫).
May your **ministers and advisors be trustworthy** (股肱谅直),
And your **counselors’ doubts be resolved** (献替元疑).
May you **promote the worthy and the good** (大举贤良),
And **bring peace and stability to the realm** (宁济区宇).
May the **four seas transform their faces** (四海革面),
And the **eight directions cultivate their hearts** (八表宅心).
May you **prioritize the fundamentals and refine culture** (务本修文),
And **govern with ease, achieving harmony without strife** (垂拱无事).

Though I am of lowly birth and humble station,
With **limited understanding and shallow insight** (识度庸浅),
I have **received the blessings of Yáo and Shùn** (荷尧沐舜),
And **sang the songs of the laborers** (击壤枢歌).
The **Zhōu** (周) **first implemented governance and instruction** (施政教之端),
And I, **listening to the harmonious melodies of the Age of Great Peace** (属听太平之咏),
**Aspire to compile and record** (志存缀辑),
To **transcribe the Master’s words** (以述矢言).

The **scrolls are vast, and my words are crude** (简牍难周，辞意斯拙),
Yet I have **carefully copied and presented this work** (谨以缮写),
To **offer at Your imperial court** (奉献阙庭).
May the **sun and moon’s light shine ever brighter** (庶日月昭明),
And **illuminate even the smallest gaps** (布余晖於漏隙).
May the **timely rains fall abundantly** (时雨咸洎),
And **moisten even the driest of twigs** (洒余润於纤枯).

I **hope only to contribute a humble grain of dust** (望希尘露之资),
How dare I **speak of steering a sunken vessel** (岂议沉舟之楫)?
Your **divine authority is near** (天威咫尺),
And my **spirit trembles in awe** (神魄震惊).

I **respectfully submit this presentation** (谨上表以闻),
And **await Your gracious response** (伏听慈旨).
I **speak thus with humility** (谨言).

**Translation:**

In the fourth year of the Yonghui era (永徽四年), on the twenty-sixth day of the eleventh month, the humble county magistrate of Huazhou, Zheng County, Adoring Servant Feng Xinggui, respectfully submits this preface.

**Note on Transmission:**
The character *"zuò"* (作) follows the *Siku Quanshu* (四库) edition.
The character *"shí"* (实) corrects the original *"huáng"* (皇) based on the *Siku Quanshu* edition.
The character *"guī"* (珪) corrects the original *"guī"* (圭).

**Preface by the Master’s Disciple:**

The Master’s name was Xuzi (鬻子), surnamed Xiong (熊), a native of Chu. He was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou.

At ninety years of age, he was seen by King Wen, who said: *"You are old."* Xuzi replied:
*"If I were to hunt beasts and chase deer, I would indeed be old.
But if I were to sit and deliberate on state affairs, I am still young."*

Thus, King Wen took him as his teacher.

He composed twenty-two treatises, titled *The Book of Xuzi* (《鬻子》).
*"Zi"* (子) is an honorific for a virtuous man.
Though his wisdom did not match the Sage, his works were not canonized as scripture—
instead, they were titled to mark his lineage.

**On the Daoist Tradition:**
Following Liu Xi’s *Nine Schools*, this belongs to the Daoist lineage.

During the Qin’s violent chaos, most records were lost.
Though *The Book of Xuzi* was not burned, its compilation was disrupted, leaving it fragmented.
According to the *Han Book of Arts and Literature* (《汉书·艺文志》), only six chapters remained—
yet this edition contains fourteen, and it is unclear which is correct.

Some chapters are disordered, with many lacunae.
Yet even in its incomplete form, its teachings on the Great Dao,
its compilation of clear histories,
its elucidation of the realm’s moral cultivation,
and its discourse on the right and wrong of virtue and punishment—
though the scrolls are not whole, their essence is discernible.
Like branches of the Deng Forest, jade from Jing Mountain, or the remnants of a noble’s writings,
they are still worthy of examination.

Xuzi was well-versed in virtue and Dao, skilled in governance.
Thus, he made the Great Sage King Wen humble in deference,
and the Sage sought his counsel.

His words embody the Way of the Sovereign,
his arguments emphasize urgent warnings,
his reasoning extends far,
his intent is vast and profound—
truly the profound words of a master,
the first among the Hundred Schools.

He wove the threads of benevolence and righteousness,
structured the governance of the realm,
promoted sincere admonition,
and expounded on methods of grand salvation.
For rulers, reading it can bring order to the state;
for officials, following it can guide administration.
It is enough to inspire the virtuous and purify the unworthy.

The *Analects* say:
*"The Three Hundred Poems—what unifies them?
It is the thought of no deceit."*

Words that endure are like tortoiseshell and mirrors.
Is not *The Book of Xuzi*’s discourse on the Dao the embodiment of this principle?

Fortunately, in moments of leisure,
I have browsed through the histories of masters and disciples.
Yet the volumes are vast,
and I cannot examine them thoroughly.

This master, unlike others,
has earnestly devoted himself to tracing the origins of his teachings,
and probing the essence of his exposition.
He does not indulge in fanciful parables or empty rhetoric,
nor does he chase after fleeting sophistry and lofty debate.
Rather, his words weigh as much as a thousand gold pieces,
and his phrases endure as long as ten thousand years.

I shall briefly annotate and outline his intent,
my thoughts soaring above the ages,
my heart resting beneath the centuries,
hoping to perpetuate the Dao and reveal his will,
hanging it like the sun and moon for all time.
May future worthies not overlook this.

**Chapter on the Five Emperors and Three Kings’ Administration**
*(From *Xuzi* Scroll One, Annotated by Adjutant Adoring the Way, Zheng Xian of Huazhou)*

**On the Selection of Officials (Section Five)**

*"To compose"* (撰) is also *"to gather"* (具).
Officials are the instruments of governance.
Again, *"to compose"* (撰) means *"to seek widely"* (博),
for when the ruler issues decrees and implements policies,
it is through the wide search for worthy officials.
The worthy are promoted; the unworthy are excluded—
thus the political Dao of the Five Emperors and Three Kings
can be passed down through the ages.

*"Bu"* (乙) follows *"Jia"* (甲),
demonstrating the order of governance.

Governance (政) is law and instruction.
Here, the imperial and royal affairs are presented
as worthy of emulation.

The worthy sage does not conspire with others—
for the sage cultivates within and governs without,
rectifying his form and aligning his shadow,
embodying the essence of true virtue,
preserving the subtle mystery of the uncarved block.
When his words issue, they become doctrine;
when he acts, they become law.
If he does not involve himself in governance,
how could he act recklessly?
This is how he brings order.

If one conspires with others, then there is no way to avoid the Dao.

The worthy sage does not conspire with others—then it is enough.
If he does conspire, he must uphold the Great Dao in his words,
not disguising error to evade the Dao,
nor seeking expedience to achieve correctness.

*"You"* (由) means *"use."*
Thus, the worthy sage’s counsel must necessarily employ the Dao.
The worthy sage speaks all day yet never strays from its essence,
and in governing affairs, his actions resonate with the Dao.

Thus, those who align with the Dao will find the Dao in return;
speech that deviates from the Dao, the worthy sage does not employ.
Yet he cannot guarantee acceptance—
the multitude’s gaze lingers on deceit, not truth;
their hearts dazzle at reputation, unable to discern reality.
The mediocre ruler, bewildered by the crowd,
how could he receive the Dao’s teachings?

Thus, the worthy sage’s Dao is not readily embraced.
He can be utterly loyal,
exhausting his heart in discussing the Dao and exhausting his loyalty to it.
His words are not devious.
Yet he cannot guarantee entrance—
exhausting loyalty in discussing the Dao,
the sage ruler accepts it, but the mediocre ruler finds it difficult.
Thus, the ruler who embodies the Dao
brings harmony between ruler and subjects,
advances the worthy and employs the wise,
and shields with vigilance without concealment.
To cast a stone into water—how could there be discord?

Yet the ruler who lacks clarity
sees estrangement between ruler and minister,
has petty men at his side,
abandons the upright and virtuous,
favors flatterers and sycophants,
ignores loyalty and sincerity,
and closes his eyes to truth—
how could he not be confused?
He rejects loyal speech.

He can be utterly trustworthy—
the worthy sage does not falsely concur,
does not speak recklessly,
maintains upright demeanor and sincere words,
clarifies truth and reality,
and must preserve this in sincerity.
Yet he cannot guarantee belief—
truthful words may not be pleasing yet align with the Dao.
The mediocre ruler, bewildered by the crowd’s deceit,
how could he trust the worthy sage’s words?
His words are not trusted.

The worthy sage, not a mere person,
does not express himself in speech alone,
but manifests in action.
The worthy sage merely does good,
using it to assail evil—
good does not claim self-righteousness,
evil is not condemned in others;
his actions, not his words, reveal this.
Thus, the one who does not condemn others does what is right,
and condemns others only in speech—
this is what all agree upon.
The one condemned by others will also condemn them.
The worthy sage, when condemning others,
never condemns them for condemning others;
he practices the Dao himself
and uses it to judge their error.

The one who abhors evil does good—
evil and good reside within oneself,
this is what all share.
The worthy sage strives for good to assail evil,
not abhorring evil in others,
thus making evil manifest through the Dao of goodness.
Yet the Dao is now revealed.

In counsel, he is utterly loyal;
in speech, utterly trustworthy;
in action, he does good to assail evil,
makes the right clear and the wrong evident,
and does not seek knowledge frivolously—
for virtue and the Dao naturally illuminate.

**The Great Dao: The Eighth Question of King Wen**
The Dao—
it covers heaven and earth,
encompasses the four directions,
reaches the eight extremes,
soars without bounds,
plunges beyond measure,
spans the six convergences,
stretches across the four quarters—
it cannot be exhausted by words or symbols,
cannot be pointed out or explained.
It responds to all unasked questions,
marks the end of governance and instruction,
embraces all forms of existence,
shines beyond the three luminaries,
acts yet does not possess,
moves yet remains unseen.

The ruler who embodies the Dao,
in all his actions, aligns with it—
his wondrous applications are boundless,
thus it is called the Great.

King Wen, following its boundless applications,
is thus called the Great Teacher questioning the Dao,
to establish an enduring model,
and thus the chapter is named.

**Governance:**
In days past, King Wen asked the Master Yuzi:
*"In days past"* refers to antiquity.
Though he ruled over countless subjects without sole authority,
he followed the Teacher to seek the Dao’s gate to governance.

*"Dare I ask—does a man have great forgetfulness?"*
He revered the Teacher’s path, hence *"dare I ask."*
King Wen sought to preserve the Great Dao for governance,
his thoughts rooted in enduring principles,
thus he first asked about great forgetfulness.

The Master replied: *"There is."*

Yuzi’s initial answer to King Wen—
there is great forgetfulness.

King Wen said: *"Dare I ask—what is great forgetfulness?"*
Yuzi did not immediately answer directly,
thus King Wen prompted him further.
King Wen wished to clarify the principle of his ultimate aspiration,
hence *"what is the matter with it?"*

Yuzi said:
*"To know one’s own evil yet not amend it,
thus harming oneself,
and losing one’s body.
When wrong occurs, do not fear to change—
all day long, do not commit evil.
Evil departs from oneself—
is it merely blackening the face and shaving the head
to leave behind a corpse’s remnant?
Thus, Chi You was executed,
the Four Deceivers were slaughtered,
Xu the Cruel was cut off from sacrifice,
and Tang the Tyrant’s lineage was overthrown.
To harm oneself and destroy one’s body,
to ruin one’s family and lose one’s state—
such is their conduct,
this is called great forgetfulness.
This is what their conduct was—
thus it is called great forgetfulness.
The conclusion of his answer.*

**The Fifth Chapter: The Five Emperors and Three Kings Honor the Dao in Governance**
To govern with virtue,
one must hold the Dao in highest regard,
for it is the blessing that transforms the nation.

At the time of King Wen,
the Three Kings were collectively referred to—
from the near to the distant,
to illustrate the Dao’s unity.

*"Zhou"* means *"comprehensive"* and *"complete,"*
speaking of the Five Emperors and Three Kings honoring the Dao,
their governance unified as one,
and nothing was left unattended.

The ancient emperors and kings—
*"In days past"* refers to those ancient rulers who honored virtue and the Dao.
By invoking antiquity to admonish the present,
they serve as a warning.

What made them enlightened?
It was because of their officials.
The emperors and kings who were called enlightened
all entrusted worthy officials,
placing them in prominent positions,
thus the Dao’s transformation flourished
and all nations found peace—
enlightenment was not achieved alone.

The ancient worthy sages,
what made them successful?
It was because of their people.
People are the foundation of the state—
gain their support, and prosperity follows.
Establish the principles and seize the moment,
relying on the myriad subjects;
all contribute their strength
to accomplish their deeds.

Strength arises from spirit—
the ruler, having a state,
first seeks divine favor;

The August Heavenly Sovereign and Earthly Deities,
the ancestral altars and mountain rivers—
their divine manifestations and mysterious omens
all converge without fail.

King Tang received divine mandate,
accepting the Great Destiny of Xia;
King Wu dreamed of the gods,
thus achieving the great pacification of Yin.

The interplay of yin and yang in darkness,
stirring all things—
how could this be their doing alone?
All transformations arise from the natural interplay of mysterious correspondences,
and their purpose is not of human making—
principles align spontaneously.
Thus it is said: *"Strength arises from spirit."*

Yet the greatest achievements belong to officials.
The sovereign measures governance and issues decrees
but does not act alone—
he entrusts worthy and capable men
to execute his will,
so the realm attains peace,
and the people know what to uphold.
This is the merit of virtuous officials and their exemplary conduct.

Blessings return to the ruler.
When officials embody noble virtue,
they dedicate their hearts and strength,
the people uphold the Dao,
and customs conform to its teachings.
Superior and inferior unite in harmony,
and virtue reciprocally flows.
Thus the land prospers in tranquility—
this is the ruler’s blessing.

In ancient times, the Five Sovereigns governed the world.
The Five Sovereigns were: the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Gaoxin,
Tang, and Yu.
Their Way shone brightly,
like the clarity of sun and moon,
as if day had replaced night.
The sun and moon move in radiance,
illuminating without favor,
reaching both hidden and revealed,
unceasing from beginning to end—
thus their brilliance never falters.

The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,
harmonizing with sun and moon in clarity—
their Way is vast and unwaning,
worthy of reverence and emulation.
Thus their Way endures eternally,
bringing blessings and teachings to ten thousand generations—
only from the Yellow Emperor onward,
and from Shun and Yu upward,
does this hold true.
*"Chief"* means *"origin"*—
the Five Sovereigns’ Way is always the beginning for all ages,
none surpassing it.

The Yellow Emperor first introduced garments,
created writing and records,
established historiographers,
crafted boats and vessels to traverse impassable waters,
tamed oxen and rode horses,
erected halls and fortified gates,
set up night patrols to guard against bandits,
invented pestles and mortars for the people’s benefit,
forged bows and arrows to awe the world,
established musical pitch-pipes,
and instituted mountain-altar sacrifices.

Zhuanxu pacified the chaos of the Nine Li tribes,
separating humanity from spirits,
restoring order to all things.

The Gaoxin clan created the *jūzhuán* (whirligig),
bells and drums,
and rush mats.

Emperor Yao lived in thatched huts without trimming,
with a three-foot earthen platform,
wearing hemp garments in summer,
deer-fur robes in winter—
his virtue was vast, beyond naming,
his achievements towering and enduring.

Emperor Shun, even as a youth, was supremely filial.
When Yao heard of his wisdom, he appointed him.
Shun then selected:
Yú as Minister of Works to regulate waters,
Ji as the Patriarch of Agriculture to sow grains,
Zī as Minister of Education to instruct the people,
Gāoyáo as Judge to arbitrate disputes,
Suì as Overseer of Labor to supervise public works,
Yì to cultivate plants,
Bòyí to preside over rituals,
and Qú to harmonize music and spirits.

Shun played the five-stringed *qin* and sang *"The South Wind"* ode.

Great Yu endured wind and rain without respite,
his hat and shoes forgotten,
he surveyed the nine regions,
inspected the four directions,
dug through the Dragon Gate,
cleared the Yi Pass,
diverted the hundred rivers,
and established the myriad states.
Had it not been for Yu’s labors,
all would have drowned like fish.

No ruler’s deeds surpass these—
thus their blessings and teachings endure through the ages.
If a ruler wishes to perpetuate the Five Sovereigns’ Way without loss,
he may endure forever.
It means the ruler follows the Five Sovereigns’ Way consistently,
never abandoning it,
thus preserving the ancestral temples and ancestral altars,
and becoming the origin for the people.

**Guard the Dao of the Five Sovereigns and Three Kings—Chapter Four of Zhou Politics**
*"Hold fast to the Great Symbols, and the world will follow.
Clarity in the Way means the world will not stray—
the Way must never be abandoned."*

When the Sage rules above,
even one virtuous scholar in a hundred *li* is rare.
Though the enlightened monarch’s influence spreads,
his virtue permeates all things,
yet even one scholar in a hundred *li* is scarcely seen—
how much more so if their traces are unseen?
Though many may be virtuous, they are as nonexistent.

When the Way declines and tyranny prevails,
even one scholar in a thousand *li* is like standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
When the Way decays and brutal chaos reigns,
all long for virtue—
even one scholar in a thousand *li* is as common as neighbors.
It means virtuous men are nowhere to be found.

**Compiling the Biographies of Officials—Chapter Three of the Transmission of Politics**
The sovereign’s means to stabilize the state,
to govern and teach,
lies in virtuous officials.
*"One must seek broadly to obtain them."*

Thus it is said:
The people are the staff of both the worthy and unworthy—
both exist within them.
The worthy bear the name of virtue;
the unworthy are the reckless and defiant.
Worthiness and unworthiness manifest in conduct—
these two, though sharing the same origin,
differ in name,
yet both depend on the most refined selection,
each with their fixed destiny.

The breadth of the world,
the multitude of the people—
worthy and unworthy are both present.
Thus the worthy are chosen,
while the unworthy are set aside.
It means the worthy do not seek advancement alone,
but are needed by the times—
the ruler must employ them,
and thus they are chosen.
The unworthy do not seek exile alone,
their actions merit no recognition,
and they are excluded from governance—
thus they are discarded.

*"Staff of ability"*—
those with surpassing intelligence
yet pride in their talents;
relying on ability and intelligence
inevitably defies the natural order.
Lightness and haste lead to perilous deviation—
thus it is said: *"Staff of ability."*

*"Loyalty and trust adorn them."*
They embody the resolve of loyalty,
must cultivate the Dao,
prioritize sincerity in conduct,
and adhere to truth.
Ritual, righteousness, benevolence, and trust
refine their character—
thus it is said: *"Loyalty and trust adorn them."*

The people are a mass of ignorance.
Oblivious and unknowing—
this is folly.
Though they are ignorant,
an enlightened ruler selects officials
to inspire them.
It means the ruler extends his heart to the people,
seeking virtuous officials
and not ruling alone.

The **scholar-officials** and the people approve of them,
and the enlightened ruler promotes them.
When they gain the support of the common heart,
excel in governance and administration,
this is how the ruler selects and employs them.

If the **scholar-officials** and the people disapprove of them,
the enlightened ruler dismisses them.
If they are like the common people—
between the wise and the foolish,
their governance does not align with the people—
this is why they are rejected and removed.

Thus, the **Sage-King** (*王者*) selects officials without forgetting,
and must ensure the people respond before harmonizing.
The ruler gathers all counsel to observe the masses,
discerns the bright to probe the **wind-sound** (*风声*),
scrutinizes the words of the lowly to seek their gains and losses,
and takes virtuous officials to propagate governance and transformation.

To extend oneself and take the virtuous—
only the **Sage** can do this.

The people are the standard for officials.
The standard is the **law and model** (*法式*).
Knowing them from below,
this is why the **law and model** for selecting officials
is examined among the common folk—
whether they are approved or not.

To examine officials among the people,
then to follow accordingly.
If the people approve of them,
the ruler promotes them;
if the people disapprove of them,
the ruler dismisses them.
This is the principle of **following** (*随*).

Governance states:
The people are the most lowly,
the utmost of lowliness.
Yet to let them select officials,
one must choose those they love.
The **Sage-Ruler** does not defy the people’s will by employing them alone.

Thus, if ten thousand love them,
then they are officials of ten thousand;
if a hundred thousand love them,
then they are officials of a hundred thousand;
if a thousand thousand love them,
then they are officials of a thousand thousand;
if ten thousand thousand love them,
then they are officials of ten thousand thousand.
From here onward,
all speak of the people’s affections and their virtuous conduct,
each having their own beloved and cherished ones,
with varying degrees of preference.
Thus, officials of ten thousand thousand
are selected as **ministers and grand viziers** (*卿相*).

The more the people love them,
the more they will surely be capable of governance.
The **resplendent** (*赫赫*) **Teacher Yīn** (*师尹*),
all the people gaze upon him in admiration.
The ruler’s chosen ones
must not lose their virtue.
**Ministers and grand viziers** are the **assistants** (*丞*) of the feudal lords.
**Ministers and grand viziers** are the ruler’s **staff of support** (*杖*),
thus they serve as the feudal lords’ **assistants**.
Hence, the lands granted to feudal lords
are derived from this rank.
The virtuous obtain them,
and their domains are marked by boundaries.
Obtained from their own retainers,
this is why it is said: *"rank derived from them"* (*秩出焉*).

**Ministers and grand viziers** are the foundation of feudal lords.
The rise or fall of governance
depends on **ministers and grand viziers**.
If the virtuous are obtained, harmony and unity prevail;
if the virtuous are lost, discord and dispersion arise.
Thus, the role of feudal lords
lies with **ministers and grand viziers**.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Governance of Duke Zhou of Lu (Jia Edition)**

The land of Qufu spans seven hundred *li*—the ancient site of Shàohào’s settlement, the domain granted to Duke Zhou of Lu. It is named thus to honor Duke Zhou’s contributions to governance and ritual propriety.

Duke Zhou said:
*"I have heard this from the Way of Governance—*
*I cite Duke Zhou’s words to illuminate governance.*

*To know virtue yet fail to act is called madness.*
*Virtue is the embodiment of the Dao, the cultivation of power.*

*When the sovereign acts virtuously above,*
*The people respond in virtue below—*
*Thus did Yáo’s reign see households worthy of ennoblement.*

*To know the Dao’s virtue yet refuse to employ it*
*Is the mark of a mad and rebellious man.*

*To know vice yet fail to amend is called delusion.*
*Vice is the thief that destroys the body.*

*When the sovereign acts in vice above,*
*The people follow in vice below, unrepentant—*
*This is the state of confusion and delusion.*

*Madness and delusion—*
*These are the warnings of the Sage-Kings.*

*To know virtue yet not act,*
*To know vice yet not amend,*
*Is to court the extremes of madness and delusion.*

*This is the clear admonition of the Sage-Kings."*

**"The Dao-Symbol of the Five Sovereigns and Three Kings: Chapter *Jia* (Second)**

To found a dynasty and establish its roots,
One must first align with the Dao.
When the Dao is harmonized,
It stands unshaken in all things.
Influence and response resonate in kind—
Naturally attuned and responsive.

*Jia* comes before *Yǐ*—
The unworthy are those who lack self-awareness.
To be unworthy means to lack resemblance.
Resemblance is likeness—
To speak of what does not conform is to lack likeness.
To know one’s own worth or unworthiness
Is to possess clarity.
One who lacks likeness—
How could they claim it themselves?
This is to say they do not know.

Yet unworthiness reveals itself in action.
Danzhu was arrogant and cruel,
Day and night without respite;
His wickedness was unrestrained,
Never ceasing.
This is what is manifest in outward conduct,
Not hidden or subtle.

Though he claimed to be virtuous,
He was still called unworthy.
Would the unworthy truly claim unworthiness?
When viewed by the worthy,
The path of unworthiness becomes clear.
Though he may be deemed worthy by others,
Or deem himself worthy—
Would others truly regard him as such?

The foolish do not claim their own foolishness,
Yet their folly is evident in their words.
Those who obscure the Dao and lack virtue—
Would they openly confess their ignorance?
Yet their foolishness is revealed in their speech and reasoning.
Though they may call themselves wise,
They are still called foolish.
Would the foolish truly consider themselves foolish?
When viewed by the wise,
The traces of folly become apparent.
Though others may deem them wise,
Or they deem themselves wise—
Would others truly regard them as such?

**The Seventh Record of the Five Sovereigns’ Governance**
To speak of the Sovereigns is to mark the beginning of their reigns,
Recording the years of their ascension and succession.
The governance of the world—
How could it be recklessly administered?
It is through the accumulation of virtue and deeds that it is attained.
Thus, the Dao of the Five Sovereigns was passed down in governance,
And they are collectively referred to as such.

In ancient times, Emperor Zhuanxu—
His mother, the Yellow Emperor’s consort, Lady Leizu,
Bore Changyi.
Changyi begot Zhuanxu,
Who became the leader of the Gaoyang clan,
Reigning for seventy-eight years.
At fifteen, he assisted the Yellow Emperor,
Of the Xuanyuan clan,
The second son of Shaodian,
His father named Emperor Hongshi,
His mother named Fushi.
She beheld a great lightning flash encircling the Northern Dipper’s pivot star,
Illuminating the wilderness,
And conceived—
Giving birth after twenty-five months.
He ruled with the virtue of Earth,
Thus called the Yellow Emperor,
Reigning for a hundred years.
Zhuanxu, from his youth,
Assisted the Yellow Emperor with his wings.
At twenty, he governed the world.
Ascending as the Son of Heaven,
His governance of the world
Followed and upheld the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,
Adhering to and refining the Yellow Emperor’s methods,
Without alteration.
He learned the Yellow Emperor’s Dao and made it constant.
Though his influence did not fully reach others,
This was how he emulated it.
He followed the Yellow Emperor’s comprehensive Dao,
Applying it consistently.

The ancient Emperor Yu,
Born of the Yellow Emperor’s consort, Xuanxiao,
Xuanxiao’s son—Emperor Yu—
His virtue ever renewed,
Thus called Gao Xin,
Reigned for seventy years.
At fifteen, he assisted Emperor Zhuanxu,
At thirty, he governed the world.
He aided Zhuanxu in ordering the world,
And at thirty ascended as Emperor.
In his governance of the world,
He upheld and illuminated the Yellow Emperor’s Dao,
Yet his virtue was slightly lesser,
Unable to fully enact the Yellow Emperor’s Dao—
Only illuminating it was all.
He learned Emperor Zhuanxu’s Dao and practiced it.
His governance and teachings
Emulated Zhuanxu’s ways.
Yet his words could not be constantly upheld.

**Yu’s Governance (Sixth in Sequence)**
Yu, the Summer Patriarch,
His merit bestowed with the dark jade,
His virtue harmonizing with the Primordial Beginning,
He entrusted the worthy and established governance,
Achieving great peace as a model to follow.
Thus, the chapter is named after him.

Yu’s rule over the world:
A great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor,
Descendant of Zhuanxu,
Surname Si, named Wencheng,
Called Gaomi,
Reigned for nine years,
Received the Mandate of Heaven through success,
Thus called Yu.
He ascended after Shun’s abdication to rule the world.

He obtained Gao Yao,
Duzi Ye,
Ji Zi,
Shi Zi Yan,
Ji Zi Ning,
Ran Zi Kan,
Qing Zi Yu—
These seven ministers’ names.
He gained seven ministers to assist his rule,
To govern the world,
And thus the world was governed.
It is said that though an emperor alone rules the world,
Even with sage virtue,
He must await worthy ministers to aid him—
Thus the people are at ease.

**Shang Governance (Seventh in Sequence, to the End of Zhou)**
It is said that Tang overthrew the wicked Jie,
To govern the myriad affairs and order the world,
With worthy ministers aiding him to achieve great peace,
Until Zhou’s folly led to the loss of the realm—
Thus, the beginning and end are recorded to name the chapter.

Tang’s rule over the world:
Surname Zi, named Li,
Called Tianyi.
He abolished cruelty and removed tyranny—thus called Tang.
He campaigned against Ge Bo,
Exiled Jie,
And took the world in order.
He obtained Qing Jiu,
Yi Yin,
Huang Li Qi,
Dongmen Xu,
Nanmen Ru,
Ximen Ci,
Beimen Ce.
Yi Yin was a concubine’s attendant from Youxinshi, made his chancellor.
Dongmen and the others—all their names.
He gained seven ministers to govern the world,
And thus the world was governed.
The seven ministers all had virtuous conduct,
Exposing faults and aiding in harmony—
Thus the people were all content.

Twenty-seven generations,
From Tang to Zhou,
Father to son, brother to brother, twenty-seven reigns.
Accumulating years, five hundred seventy-six years to Zhou.
For Summer, "year" excludes the first year of accession.

**Yu’s Governance (Sixth, Revisited)**
With five tones to govern,
Diligent in the realm,
Worthy of being supreme.
Yu’s rule over the world used five tones.
Ninefold depths of obscurity,
Below, difficult to approach,
Yet matters the people wished to report were repelled—
Thus, he hung the five tones to summon them for governance.

At the gate, he hung the bell, drum, small bell, stone chime,
Hung on the *gōng* stand.
And placed the *táo* drum,
Placed on the ground.
To attract scholars from the four seas.
When scholars from the four seas came with words,
They struck the five tones to transmit their voices.
He inscribed on the *gōng* stand:
*"Teach me the Dao, strike the drum,"*
The drum moves creatures—
Thus, striking it aligns with the Dao.
*"Teach me righteousness, strike the bell,"*
The bell is a metal tone—
Thus, teaching righteousness, strike the bell.
*"Teach me affairs, ring the small bell,"*
The small bell, metal chime with wooden tongue—
Thus, when matters require action, ring the small bell.
*"Speak to me of worries, strike the stone chime,"*
Worries, a sorrowful tone.
The stone chime’s sound is mournful—
Thus, when worried, strike the stone chime.
*"Speak to me of lawsuits, beat the *táo* drum."*
This is the five tones.
Lawsuits require swift resolution—
Thus, beat the *táo* drum to present them.
The above inscriptions were all carved on the *mí* stand.

Thus, Yu once sat on a single meal and rose seventy times,
At noon, not having time to eat fully,
So urgent were his affairs,
That he showed his eagerness to receive scholars.
He said:
*"I still fear scholars from the four seas will linger on the roads."*
His usual travels were not where he should worry.
Thus, scholars from the four seas all arrived.
Matters were always aligned with the Dao,
Harmonizing above and below,
Responding to gatherings without fail.
Thus, when Yu was in court,
He could arrange ranks.
Not having time to eat fully,
Listening to governance without fatigue,
The court was serene and still—
Then there were no affairs.

**The Dao Aligns with the Five Emperors and Three Kings (Fifth Chapter on Governance)**
When a gentleman enters his office,
Bright as the sun at dawn.
Entering, radiant—
People preserve their blessings.
Departing, dim—
People lose their teachings.
This is called attaining the harmonious governance.

A state belongs to ministers, relatives, and worthy men.
If there is a state, there are ministers and relatives.
The worthy are the ministers and relatives;
People entrust them, the ruler employs them.
Could the unworthy be employed?
With or without a state, the wise govern it.
A ruler does not himself make peace,
Nor does he himself cause chaos.
What makes peace is the power of wisdom and strategy.
Wisdom is not a single day’s resolve.
Accumulating merit and achievements,
Practicing the Dao without weariness,
To fulfill his resolve.
Governance is not a single day’s plan.
Planning is the work of the mind.
Establishing virtue as the highest,
Modifying governance and teaching with sincere balance.
Planning cannot be achieved in a single day.
Governance of resolve and planning
Lies with the emperor—
Then the people know what to preserve.

The sovereign above has the Dao,
And its transformation flows below.
The distant and near revere virtue,
The four borders face no peril,
The people are pure and harmonious,
Bandits and thieves cease to stir—
Thus, the people know what to rely on
And what to avoid.

Wealth and nobility, poverty and lowliness,
Do not encroach upon one another.
Ren, virtue, propriety, and wisdom
Proceed from his gate.
No defiance of governance and teaching,
The common folk are blessed—
This is the way to know what to avoid.

To promulgate teaching and issue commands
For the benefit of all under Heaven—
This is called the Dao.
To precede it with boundless love,
To expound it with virtue and righteousness,
To precede it with reverence and yielding,
To guide it with ritual and music,
To neither seize another’s time
Nor obstruct another’s interests—
Thus, calamities and disorders do not arise.

The Dao of bringing blessings—
Is this not what is meant?

Mutual affinity between the sovereign and people—
This is called harmony.

With supreme virtue, he instructs them;
With essential Dao, he governs them.
When sovereign and people share a single heart,
This is called harmony.

When the people obtain their desires without seeking—
This is called trust.

The sun rises and they labor,
The sun sets and they rest,
Not wearying in their tasks,
Not burdened by harshness or vexation.
They savor their food,
Find comfort in their dwellings,
And delight in their occupations—
Could these things be sought from without?

When the sovereign above practices the Dao,
Then his governance may truly be called great trust.

To remove all harm from under Heaven—
This is called ren.

To embrace love for all things,
To extend compassion outward,
Even as in the case of King Tang’s conquest of Ge Bo,
Or his banishment of Jie to Nan Chao,
And Yu’s separation of mountains and rivers,
And establishment of states—
Thus, the people are spared from chaos,
And dwell securely in their homes.

Is ren distant?
This is its utmost reach.

Ren and trust,
Harmony and Dao—
These are the sovereign’s instruments.
These four principles,
The sovereign’s instruments for ruling under Heaven,
He delights in promoting them.

If one transgresses them,
Then under Heaven will depart and rebel—
It will not belong to him.

All things have their instruments;
What is used to benefit them,
This is what we call their instruments.
If one defies their proper use,
Can one truly claim to wield their instruments?

Thus, name and instrument cannot be falsely attributed.
What one cultivates must be done
With their proper instruments.

To obtain their instruments,
So that harmony may be achieved;
If one does not wield their proper instruments,
The benefit is distant—
How could it succeed?

So too for the feudal lords who aspire to kingship—
Those who do not use the sovereign’s instruments
Cannot succeed.

Speaking of the vastness of under Heaven
And the weight of the divine instrument,
If not the true sovereign,
It is difficult to govern it.
The sovereign’s *qi* descends,
And then it may be carved and apportioned.

One must practice ren and trust,
Harmony and Dao,
Only then can one attract and embrace all the people,
And encompass the four quarters.
The Western Earl rose to power through reverence and yielding,
The Duke of Nanyang obtained governance through the seven Dao—
Without the proper person,
Could these achievements be attained in vain?

The sovereign’s governance is the seventh principle by which he rules under Heaven.

Heaven and Earth are set and all things are born,
Yin and Yang transform and the four seasons are fixed.
Distinction and governance are the methods of rule;
Pursued to their beginning and end,
They may become laws.

Heaven and Earth are divided and all things are born,
The Heavenly *qi* in its stillness is singular and unified,
In its movement is upright and straight;
The Earthly *qi* in its stillness is gathered and contained,
In its movement is expansive and open.
Thus, they produce the vastness of all things.

All things are born, and then man governs them.
Governance is the means to align with Heaven and Earth.
It is said that Heaven and Earth cannot command one another,
Cannot restrain one another,
And thus require man to govern them and bring order.

Without governance,
All things would not be orderly.
Heaven and Earth can give life but cannot refrain from killing—
It is said that Heaven and Earth can give life but cannot refrain from killing.
Only what Heaven and Earth kill,
Man cannot give life to.
Heaven’s power to give life,
Only Heaven’s power to kill is possible.
If only Heaven kills,
Could man give life?
This is what cannot be given life.

When man transforms and becomes virtuous,
Among all things, man is the most noble.
To transform and become virtuous,
This is the natural order of Heaven.

When beasts transform, they become evil.
They are born with the *qi* of their nature,
Without wisdom to adorn them—
Not of man’s kind,
Could they not be evil?

If a man is not virtuous,
He is called a beast.
When man transforms and becomes virtuous,
This is called the natural order of Heaven.
Now, those who do not become virtuous,
With their soaring emptiness and trampling of the real—
How are they different from this?

There is Heaven before there is Earth,
Heaven is above, Earth is below,
Heaven and Earth follow one another—
This is the natural order.
There is Earth before there is distinction,
The Three Powers are firmly established,
And all things are differentiated.
There is distinction before there is virtue,
The virtue of husband and wife is made manifest,
The virtue of sovereign and minister is displayed.
There is virtue before there is teaching,
Officials are appointed, governance and teaching are practiced;
Father and son are preserved, households establish teaching—
Thus, they may reach the heights above.
There is teaching before there is Dao,
When the traces of teaching are clearly marked,
It is constrained by the Dao;
If one deviates from the Dao,
Things cannot be at peace.
There is Dao before there is order,
Names and things are established,
And order naturally exists.
There is order before there are numbers.
When names and order are made clear,
They are governed by them.

Numbers end with ten in unity,
Extending even to thousands and millions,
Using the *shu* and *xu* calculations—
This is the principle of Heaven’s movements.
There is night and there is day,
There is dawn and there is dusk—
Thus, they are reckoned as numbers.

The sky has three hundred and sixty degrees,
One degree per day,
Three hundred and sixty days completing a full cycle;
Within a single day,
Dawn and dusk are a hundred *ke*,
And this is fixed as the reckoning of numbers.
The moon waxes and wanes,
The phases of union and separation are recorded by numbers.
Within a year there are twelve months,
Each month has waxing and waning.
The sun and moon sometimes align in sequence,
Sometimes separate in sequence,
And this completes a year.
The sun reaches its limit in sequence,
The moon reaches its limit in phases,
The stars return to their courses—
Then the numbers shall reach their end.
Thus, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations
Run their courses through twelve months,
And return to their original positions.

The **Memoir**—this is but the gathering.

The four [celestial bodies] are all arrayed,
And thus their reckoning is established.
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each govern
The days and months of a year.

Above this lies the **Dao of governance**—
The standard by which one must act.
Governance is **protection**.
From beginning to end, this is **protection**.
Governance is **rectification**.
That which rectifies the world,
And establishes the **Way**—
The **Heavenly Cycle** guards and protects,
At its start, it transforms;
At its end, it brings peace;
It does not allow deviation.

**Caution:** The Sixth Warning to Duke Zhou of Lu
The laws of punishment must conform to order,
Fitting the needs of governance;
The **virtue of sparing life** must align with just statutes.
Thus, the wise and enlightened,
Supporting the Zhou dynasty,
Their admonitions and encouragements
May be spoken of in praise.

The great principles of a state
Lie in rewards and punishments.
If these two are misapplied,
What guidance can there be?
Thus, this is the foundation of governance—
Hence, the **Memoir** is titled as such.

In days of old,
*"In days of old"*—this is the speech of past times.
Duke Zhou sent Lord Kang to govern at Yin,
Lord Kang, Duke Zhou’s younger brother,
To the lands of the Three Guards of Wei.
The Yin people often rebelled,
Thus, the sage sent his virtuous younger brother to rule.

He admonished him, saying:
*"Better to acquit the guilty
Than to condemn the innocent.
Life hangs in the balance—
Justice must be meticulously weighed.
If punishments are excessive,
By what standard shall they be judged?
Thus, one must not lightly condemn the innocent,
But rather err in favor of the guilty.
This too is the **Way of benevolent leniency**.*

*"There shall be no innocent condemned,
Nor punishment without clear cause—
Though punishment be severe, without justice, it will not restrain.
This means punishment must be applied only to the guilty.*

*"There shall be no meritorious deed left unrewarded.
If rewards are unclear,
Though given, they will not inspire.
This means rewards must be bestowed only upon the worthy."*

He admonished him further, *"O Kang,*
The repeated warnings are to show earnestness.
Kang, your given name—
Take heed in meting out punishment and reward.
Punishment and reward—
These are the reins of the state.
In anger, one may punish without just cause;
In joy, one may reward without due merit.
Moreover, excessive rewards may breed arrogance and licentiousness,
While excessive punishments may strike the innocent.
If rewards match merit, the virtuous are encouraged;
If punishments fit the crime, the wicked desist.
This must be weighed with utmost care."*
