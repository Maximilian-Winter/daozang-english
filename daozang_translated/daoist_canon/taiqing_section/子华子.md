**Preface to the *Zihua zi***
By Liu Xiang, Defender of the Left Capital Waterworks and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness:

The *Zihua zi* collated in the imperial archives originally comprised twenty-four pian. After comparison, fourteen were found to be duplicates, leaving ten pian, which have now been edited, transcribed, and prepared for copying.

Zihua zi of the Cheng clan, named Ben, styled Zihua, was a native of Jin. During the reign of Duke Qing of Jin, governance fell into the hands of the Six Ministers. When Zhao Jianzi began to assert his ambitions, he recruited worthy and talented scholars as retainers for his household. Zihua zi was born in this era.

Learned and erudite, he mastered the ancient classics—the *Three August Ones*, the *Five Emperors*, the *Mountains and Seas*—as well as the transmitted records of former courts. Of an open and forthright nature, he excelled in debate. Refusing to curry favor with the feudal lords, he gathered disciples, composed writings, and styled himself Chengzi. His reputation spread widely, and his name became known among the lords.

Confucius encountered him in the suburbs and sighed, “A worthy scholar of the world!” Jianzi wished to appoint him to office but could not secure his service. He then dispatched envoys bearing gifts of dark silk and jade, seeking to enfeoff him with the rank of *guirui*. At that time, Jianzi executed Dou Du and Shun Hua, prompting Confucius to compose *The Melody of the Riverside*. Zihua zi likewise hesitated and refused to rise. Enraged, Jianzi threatened him with military force. Zihua zi departed and went to Qi. Duke Jing of Qi could not employ him, so Zihua zi lodged with the Yan clan and retitled his work *Zihua zi*. After Jianzi’s death, Xiangzi ascended, and Zihua zi returned to Jin. By then, he was already aged and no longer sought office, living out his days until his death.

Today, his book survives in fragmented and disordered passages. It appears that his disciples and followers pieced together what they had heard, lacking any coherent sequence—this is not the original work as composed by Zihua zi himself.

In essence, Zihua zi took the Dao and virtue as his guiding principles, structuring his thought with benevolence and righteousness. He cultivated sincerity and nurtured his conduct, refusing to compromise for personal gain. Only Confucius recognized his worth, and Yan Pingzhong, a grandee of Qi, formed a lasting bond with him. In that era, the feudal lords vied for power, harboring grudges and entangling themselves in misfortune, daily resorting to cunning and deceit. Zihua zi’s words were like pouring water upon stone—unreciprocated. His failure to find recognition is enough to bring tears to one’s eyes.

Respectfully submitted with this table of contents.
*Your servant Xiang, risking death, presents this.*

#1 Preface states: Zihua zi’s surname was Cheng, given name Ben, style Zihua, a native of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period. The *Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao*, however, asserts that Cheng Ben and Zihua zi were not the same person. Prior to the Qin, there existed a text titled *Zihua zi*, cited in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, yet it was already unrecorded in the *Han shu Yiwen zhi*—by Liu Xiang’s time, the work had been lost. This edition emerged after the Southern Song of Nanbo, “likely the work of a literatus of talent, writing in indignation and attributing it to an ancient figure.”

**Scroll One of *Zihua zi***
*By Cheng Ben of Jin*

**Yangcheng Xuqu Questions**

Yangcheng Xuqu, through Beigong Zi, sought an audience with Zihua zi, saying: “Xuqu wishes to present a query. The Great Beginning’s embryonic form—all things’ inception—whence does the wind turn, and who turns it? The triads and sextets—who exhausts them, and who commands them? You, Master, have heard these matters from the ancients’ records—if there is insight to be offered, Xuqu would humbly receive what remains.”

Zihua zi replied: “Alas! How could Ben presume to comprehend such things? Permit me to attempt an explanation, and may you, in turn, attempt to listen.”

Within the primal chaos, this is called the Great Beginning. Truly there arose the Three Qi: the upper qi is named *Shi* (Commencement), the middle qi is named *Yuan* (Origin), and the lower qi is named *Xuan* (Mystery). *Xuan* draws upon *Yuan*, *Yuan* draws upon *Shi*, and *Shi* draws upon the Beginning. The Supreme Reality divides and unites—through the Three it becomes One, then separates into Two, each possessing its concentrated essence, and this is called *yin* and *yang*. Two doubled and trebled yields nine, and there the reckoning is complete.

Thus, the true qi of the Three *Yin* is lodged in wind, its concentrated essence named *Tai Xuan* (Great Mystery); the true qi of the Three *Yang* is lodged in water, its concentrated essence named *Tai Yi* (Great One). *Tai Yi* is the true *yang*; *Tai Xuan* is the true *yin*. The true qi of *yang* is named *red*; the true qi of *yin* is colored *black*. Water is *yang*, yet when latent it becomes *yin*; wind is *yin*, yet when manifest it becomes *yang*. Above is red, below is black; to the left is blue-green, to the right is white; yellow abides in the Central Palace as the Five Movements revolve in ceaseless flow—thus arises the image of the revolving hub.

Water contains the central essence of *Tai Yi*, and so it moistens the hundred things and courses beneath the earth; wind contains the central essence of *Tai Xuan*, and so it animates and transforms the hundred things and courses above the heavens. The image of the red above forms *Li*; the image of the black below forms *Kan*. That by which the two poles are balanced is the presence of the center between them. Before the center is established, the two poles do not take shape. Thus *Kan* and *Li* alone pivot upon the central qi, standing between heaven and earth, ceaselessly generating the ten thousand things, ever renewing without end.

*Yang* qi is fire—when fire prevails, the day of the winter solstice is dry; *yin* qi is water—when water prevails, the day of the summer solstice is damp. Fire flames upward; water flows downward. Birds fly aloft; fish stir below. Things of a kind move in concert, flame and root respond to one another—who exhausts the reason of their coming? Who commands the reason of their being? Following what is so, it is so; yet it is not so. Is it so? Is it not so? I, too, know not the reason of its being so—this is called the Source of the Myriad Transformations.

Above, the breaking forth forms heaven; below, the breaking forth forms earth. Once the breaking forth has occurred, it is named *Zhong* (Center). The breaking forth must have that with which it unites—this is named *He* (Harmony). *Zhong* and *He* mysteriously unite, and the ten thousand things are transformed and generated—this is called the Three Threes and Six Sixes.

Yangcheng Xuqu said: “Without the Master’s words, I would have nearly remained benighted.”
Zihua zi replied: “Alas! How could Ben presume to comprehend such things?”

Pray let me attempt to speak of it, and may you likewise attempt to listen.

Zihua zi said: The Dao is One. Yet I and the Dao make three. My hundred bones and nine orifices, my hair and skin’s luster, my viscera and liver-diaphragm, my exhalations and inhalations, my fluids and breath—all are none other than the Dao. From this point onward, even the great reckoner’s celestial stems and earthly branches cannot record it. Thus the Dao stands as One, yet the transformations of the myriad things and the evolutions of the hundred affairs disperse into ten thousand distinctions, seething and boundless.

Those of old who understood the Dao devoted themselves to preserving their lives. To preserve one’s life is not to lose what one possesses. Not to lose what one possesses is to guard the Dao. To guard the Dao is to house the spirit. Therefore, to preserve life wholly is highest; to diminish it is next; death is next; and coercion is lowest.

What is meant by preserving life wholly? The six desires all attain their proper measure. What is meant by diminishing life? The six desires attain their proper measure only in part. When life is diminished, one’s reverence for what is noble grows thin; the greater the diminution, the thinner the reverence. What is meant by death? To be without knowledge and return to one’s state before birth. What is meant by coercion? The six desires attain none of their proper measure, and all obtain what they most detest.

No disgrace is greater than injustice. Injustice is coercion, and thus it is said that coercion is worse than death. As is human nature: what the ear hears and the eye sees is what one knows. To hear what one most detests is worse than to hear nothing; to see what one most abhors is worse than to see nothing. Thus when thunder crashes, one covers one’s ears—from fear. What is prized in savoring fine meats is not the same as eating rotten rats; what is prized in drinking fine wine is not the same as drinking spoiled liquor; what is prized in honoring life is not the same as coercion. Those who live under coercion are driven to extremity and return to ruin, and thus it is said that coercion is lowest.

Gongzhong Cheng asked Cheng zi: “People often say that when the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, the hundred spirits emerged and received their offices in the courtyard of the Hall of Light. The Emperor then mined copper from Mount Shou, built a great furnace, and cast a sacred tripod atop the mountain. When the tripod was complete, a grass dragon descended to welcome him. He mounted the white clouds and ascended to the Emperor’s realm. His lesser ministers could not follow; they clung to the dragon’s whiskers, but their strength failed and they fell. The Emperor’s bow and robes dropped, and the people mourned them with long wails, naming the bow ‘Wailing Crow’ and enshrining his garments in Qiaoling. Is this true?”

Cheng zi replied: “No.”

How extreme is the world’s love for the strange and uncanny! The sage is of the same kind as other people. Kind being the same, form is the same; form being the same, qi is the same; qi being the same, knowledge is the same. Kind differing, form differs; form differing, qi differs; qi differing, knowledge differs. That by which people serve as rulers and leaders is kind; that by which they serve one another is form; that by which they govern and restrain one another is qi; that by which they sustain one another is knowledge. The difference between people and dragons, between dragons and tripods, between tripods and clouds—these distinctions are clear in speech, but how could they summon and command one another? It must be false.

How extreme is the world’s love for the strange and uncanny! I have heard that the sages of highest antiquity, in shaping the world’s teachings and customs, employed both direct speech and indirect speech. Direct speech offers forth the truth plainly; indirect speech borrows images to convey meaning. The more indirect the speech, the longer it endures in transmission. Yet when transmission lasts long and falsehoods arise, the wise correct them. When distortions grow severe and confusion spreads, the wise put a stop to them.

Now, the Yellow Emperor’s governance of the world involved subtle resonances that rose and sank, making him the source of a hundred blessings. Being the source of a hundred blessings, it follows that the hundred spirits received their offices in his courtyard. His mining of copper was to refine hard essence. Ascending Mount Shou was to seek lofty clarity. Building the great furnace was to stir the transformative power of yang. The sacred tripod was an instrument for maturing things. Above, water; below, fire—these two qi ascended and descended to harmonize, embodying the reality of central harmony. The many dragons were the host of yang qi. Clouds were the attendants of dragons. The Emperor’s realm was the gateway of the numinous terrace and the transformation of the heart’s art.

The Yellow Emperor, in terms of kind, form, qi, and knowledge, though the same as other people, nevertheless with each achievement rose ever higher. With each achievement and each ascent, his subtlety penetrated ever further, and the abode of his spirit became ever more distant—so far removed from others that lesser ministers could not match his knowledge. Grasping the dragon’s whiskers was their glimpse of what lay below; their failure to ascend was their lack of vision above. Those who see below but not above are scholars; those who see neither above nor below are the common people.

The bow, robes, and crown were the instruments by which the Emperor refined the world and regulated customs. The people, lacking vision, cherished only what governed them. Thus, when the Emperor departed, they wailed to express their longing and enshrined his relics to honor his legacy—this was speech that borrowed images to convey meaning. Yet people hasten to transmit such tales, deceiving one another. How extreme is the world’s love for the strange and uncanny!

A thousand generations hence, there will surely be rulers who, enamored of loftiness and yearning for greatness, covet long life and轻举, envying such attainments. Their cunning, flattering ministers will follow and indulge them, leading them to aspire to what the Yellow Emperor achieved. Yet the great constant of human life is this: from birth to youth and vigor, then to decline and old age, and finally to death—this is shared by sage and commoner alike, and even the most enlightened cannot escape it.

Moreover, from the records handed down since remote antiquity—whether preserved or lost—from the times of Datong, Zhonghuang, Hexu, Zunlu, and onward, the so-called sages have belonged to many lineages. I truly fear that atop the great vault of heaven, towers and pavilions will pile up, so numerous that even if ten or a hundred times as many were built, there would still be no place for them—what then would govern them? Whom would they command? Yet the world has remained in silent obscurity until now, so utterly mistaken is this.

Yet the people of the world—those who know admire, while the foolish strain to emulate. How extreme is the world’s love of the strange and uncanny!

The Nine Tripods of Zhou were cast by Yu to depict divine and treacherous beings. The Yellow Emperor forged one, Yu forged nine; their craft was the same, yet the purposes to which they were suited differed utterly—this alone should resolve all doubt. Moreover, the doubts that circulate in the world are not merely about what is transmitted.

In former times, there was a man of Song named Ding whose household had no well. He had to go out daily to draw water. One day, a man of his family remained outside, and Ding, weary of this, gathered laborers to dig a well in his courtyard. When the work was done, he told his household: “Now that we have dug this well, we have gained a man.” Someone heard this and spread the word: “Ding dug a well and found a man inside.” The people of the state repeated it to one another until the tale reached the lord of Song. The lord summoned Ding and questioned him. Ding replied: “Since I dug the well, my household has gained the labor of one man—it is not that I found a man inside the well.”

Thus, the Yellow Emperor’s casting of the divine tripod is like the tale of the man in the well. The wise correct such errors, just as the lord of Song summoned Ding to question him. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be rulers who, enamored of lofty heights and grand ambitions, will scorn long life and aspire to transcendence. Their cunning, favor-seeking ministers will only encourage them, leading them to covet what the Yellow Emperor achieved. This is why I return to this subject again and again without cease.

Take heed, young one.

When Tanzi was renowned among the feudal lords for his mastery of ritual, Zihua Zi hastened to study under him. Upon meeting Tanzi, Zihua Zi said: “This differs from what I have heard. Ritual is what the former kings established to settle things, not to unsettle them. Ritual is what the former kings used to open the Way, not to expose it.”

Blue and yellow, embroidered patterns—when the spectacle of ornament is exhausted, the five colors fade. Gong and zhi notes, echoing and resounding—when the sounds of life are complete, the eight tones dissolve into chaos. On land, there are snares and traps; in water, nets and weirs—thus, winged birds and hidden fish have no hope of escaping their fate. Does not the *Book of Songs* say: “Though they lurk in the depths, they are clearly seen”?

Yet Tanzi does not merely unsettle ritual—he further exposes it. If Tanzi truly understood ritual and music, this differs from what I have heard.

Zihua Zi rose, ordered his carriage prepared, and returned home by the road he had come. *Zihua Zi*, Scroll One ends.

Confucius, upon Zihua Zi’s return from the state, encountered him on the road. They halted their carriages, turned to face one another, and spoke the whole day through, growing deeply familiar. Confucius then instructed Zilu, saying, “Fetch the eastern silk to present to the master.” Zilu replied with disdain, “I have heard that a scholar does not visit uninvited, nor does a woman marry without a matchmaker—such is not the ritual of the noble man for making acquaintances.”

After a pause, Confucius turned again to Zilu, who repeated his earlier response. Confucius said, “How obstinate you are, Zilu! Does not the *Book of Songs* say:
*There is a beautiful one,
Pure breeze, so graceful—
By chance we meet,
Just as I wished.*
Now, Master Cheng is a worthy scholar of the world. If we do not present him with a gift at this moment, we may never see him again. Go, my disciple, and do as I say.”

Zihua Zi said, “The Dao has no fixed form; in emptiness, it congeals into the singular qi, and in dispersion, it spreads forth as the ten thousand things. The cosmos is that by which the Dao is borne and transmitted. The ten thousand things are one—who knows whence they arise? Who knows where they end? The congealed governs coagulation, while the bold governs dispersion; in opening and closing, the myriad forms succeed one another. In the age of great antiquity, all was tranquil and serene, deer and elk gathered in herds, their wisdom unhurried, their joy unforced—this is what is called *yu* (space). Being and non-being oppose one another, high and low incline toward each other, fullness and decay press upon one another, vastness and minuteness take shape in contrast—through these, life arises, through these, death comes; through these, loss occurs, through these, completion is achieved—this is what is called *zhou* (time). *Yu* is where emotions connect; *zhou* is where principles interpenetrate. Thus, the Dao has no fixed form; in emptiness, it congeals into the singular qi, and in dispersion, it spreads forth as the ten thousand things. The cosmos is that by which the Dao is borne and transmitted.”

Zihua Zi continued, “Words move the heart and produce echoes, yet the echo fades before the emotion shifts. Intent gives rise to thought, yet the thought changes before the matter is resolved. Why is this so? Because the spirit cannot contain it all.”

Seventy-nine generations of rulers, their laws and systems unaligned, their proclamations inconsistent, yet all reigned over the realm. To commend the virtuous and punish the wicked—this is the rectitude of governance. That by which it is enacted is *jingcheng* (utmost sincerity). Without *jingcheng* made manifest, none can rule as king. In later ages, haste and severity demand leniency, hypocrisy is debated while loyalty is tested—words do not reflect true intent, thoughts are not genuine, yet they expect the people not to rebel. Alas! This is like sitting in a darkened chamber at dusk, or mistaking white for black; like launching a boat on dry land or setting a cart in motion upon the river—such things cannot be left to chance or luck.

Thus, a ruler who seeks order and intends to act must first rectify his fundamental methods, stabilize his essence without wavering, and preserve his sincerity without flaw. Only then may his words align with his emotions, his intent be made clear and direct. Though the age be chaotic, though customs be corrupt, to say that influence does not respond like an echo—this I cannot believe.

Zihua Zi dwelled in Lingse. Viscount Jian of Zhao sought to employ him and dispatched an envoy bearing gifts to his gate, saying: “This humble minister lacks envoys, so I send my subordinate to respectfully prepare these meager offerings, to earnestly convey my lord’s impending command.”

Zihua Zi returned the gifts, bowed twice with solemnity to receive the envoy, and led him into the courtyard. He bowed again and delivered his reply: “Your subject, so-and-so, should he incur guilt, would not dare evade punishment. Yet due to his ungrudging nature, he now bears the distress of carrying firewood in bonds. Though his illness may soon abate, I shall present myself at court—how dare I further trouble my lord’s command?”

The envoy said: “My lord has further instructions, which this humble minister respectfully conveys to you: It is the grace and favor of the state of Jin that he wishes to share with you. Should you not refuse his earnest invitation and deign to depart, he requests that your attendants be granted stipends and ranks, bearing the jade scepter.”

Zihua Zi descended the steps, bowed twice, and replied: “Your subject, so-and-so, holds no office at court and suffers from a grievous illness, unworthy of my lord’s command. I dare not partake in such matters.” He bowed twice more and escorted the envoy to the gate. Returning to his chamber, he gathered his family and prepared to depart.

The disciples stood in a cluster, doubtful. Beigong Zi said: “I have heard that when one cultivates oneself in private, one’s name rises in public—this is the common principle of past and present. My lord is the state’s senior minister, from whom governance issues. To engage in ritual exchange and not respond—would this not be improper?”

Zihua Zi said: “Yi, I took you to be one who could forget words, yet sprouts of doubt still rise in you. What sprouts within must cloud what appears without—this is what I meant. Moreover, why does he summon me? Surely not without purpose. He must have some position in mind for me. One who is positioned by others cannot secure the position of his own choosing. Thus the ancients were cautious about how they were positioned.

Once, on my return from Tan, I heard Confucius speak, and his words clung to my heart, never forgotten. What Confucius aspired to far surpassed others. When my lord summoned him, Confucius circled his chariot by the riverbank and refused to cross. He took up his zither and composed his intent, calling it *The Melody by the River*. Its lyrics said: ‘The river’s waters flow vast—Qiu does not cross this. It is fate.’

What Confucius refused to do is precisely what I must do. Yi, I took you to be one who could forget words, yet sprouts of doubt still rise in you. To measure a gentleman’s heart by what a petty man observes—Yi, you are gravely mistaken.”

Beigong Zi then insisted on presenting him to Viscount Jian of Zhao. When Viscount Jian heard that Zihua Zi had arrived, he bowed twice and welcomed him, saying: “I have been blessed with the state’s favor to govern within its four borders. My late lord had rituals for bestowing upon guests, and the steward of the lodge was entrusted with managing these exchanges. You, sir, have condescended to stay in our humble domain for some time. With the year’s hardships and the servants’ daily concerns, I wish to offer you a border district of thirty or forty *li*, or even fifty or sixty *li*, to provide for your fodder and provisions. May you deign to oversee it.”

Zihua Zi said: “Your servant is not martial, and my years advance. My hair is strewn with white, and I fear I cannot bear your affairs, lest I become a source of failure for you. You have four frontiers to relieve the four quarters—I am not equal to the task.”

The next day, Zihua Zi took his meal at the mouth of Jiaoting. Beigong Zi said: “Qin has not yet erred. To sever another’s goodwill and then erase your tracks as you depart—your standards for holding others accountable are too exacting.”

Zihua Zi said: “Indeed, but this is beyond your understanding. The lord of Qin has grand ambitions and far-reaching demands. What he expects of me is weighty, and I cannot meet his expectations. Have you also heard of the affair at Muye? The six armies of Zhou pressed near the suburbs and drew up in formation. King Wu’s sandal strap came undone. Five ministers were about to receive his oath before him, but the king turned and ordered them to tie it. The five ministers glanced at one another and replied: ‘What we serve our lord king for is not to fasten sandal straps.’ The king had no choice but to lay down his banner and battle-axe and tie it himself.

A lord who can bring his ministers to the point of refusing some things may then demand that they do others. A minister who can refuse some things may then do all things. I have not yet reached the point of doing all things, but I can refuse some.”

Zihua Zi departed from Zhao, and Viscount Jian of Zhao was displeased. Zhu Guo was overseeing the left side of Guang Gate when the viscount summoned him and explained the situation. Zhu Guo replied: “That commoner is arrogant and insults his superiors—he is not one the law would spare. Moreover, he is of no use to the state.”

The viscount said: “Go with soldiers and apprehend him.”

Zhu Guo reached Ling Pass, but Zihua Zi had already been gone for five days. Zhu Guo sent word: “It is too late.”

Viscount Jian regretted his decision and dispatched envoys to Qi. He sent a hundred messengers, and Dong Anyu lodged a letter to summon him. Zihua Zi kowtowed and came, bowing twice to receive the envoy in the courtyard. He presented his reply: “Your servant, a fugitive of my lord, has failed to cultivate himself and, though dwelling among the feudal lords, has become a source of concern for my lord. I have heard that things are confined by what they find sweet, and scholars are confined by what they uphold. Your servant is unworthy and harbors ambitions for the four quarters—how dare I become one whom your attendants must condescend to engage?

When hills rise high, burrows form atop them, and foxes and badgers take shelter. When valleys run deep, abysses form below, and fish and turtles find peace. When pines and cypresses flourish, shade forms in the grove, and travelers find respite. Your servant is unworthy but indeed has hidden motives. May your attendants illuminate what I hold within, as the sun and moon ascend to brightly illumine the state of Jin. Then scholars from the four seas will flock to you, treading calloused paths, to uphold my lord’s illustrious reputation. How could this be only for your fugitive servant? Even if your servant were to die in the wild and be cast into a ditch, how dare I forget my lord’s grace? May your attendants deign to consider this.”

When Viscount Jian received the letter, he summoned Wuxu and warned him: “Zhu Guo is a petty man who has caused me to offend Ben. When I die, you must restore him—do not forget.” Xiangzi said: “Yes.”

*Scroll Two of Zihua Zi concludes.*

**Scroll Three of Zihua Zi**

The people of Jin, Cheng Ben-zhuo recorded:

**Beigong Zi Seeks Office**

Beigong Zi was about to take office in Wei. Zihua Zi said: “Come, have you ever spoken to me of how you cultivate your mind?”

Beigong Zi replied: “I have not yet completed my studies. For now, I cannot even gather enough firewood to sustain myself and must rely on others to fill my cheeks. Nevertheless, I carefully keep in mind what I wish to pursue as good and what I wish to shun as evil—hoping thereby to remain whole.”

Zihua Zi’s expression darkened, and he asked: “What do these words mean? Why should goodness be worthy of pursuit, or evil worthy of avoidance? Let me tell you: when the sage does not emerge, the world grows ever more chaotic, daily sinking deeper into delusion. One seeks to preserve oneself but ends in ruin; one seeks to guide others but ends in losing them. For the sake of goodness, the true king arises, intending to purge the world’s corruption and strife. How can one merely avoid evil and call it sufficient? If evil is not eradicated, disorder will never cease—so what use is goodness then?”

Beigong Zi exclaimed: “Ah! Is this so? I wish to hear the rest of your teaching.”

Zihua Zi said: “Within a person, the hollow center is no larger than a thumb’s breadth—yet the numinous spirit dwells there. Affairs and things, intricate as tangled silk, chaotic as wading through perilous depths: one moment they startle and alarm, the next they breed taboos, and the next they inflict wounds. Thus, in the span of a single day, even a single hour, that thumb’s breadth of space may burn like fire or freeze like ice. How can what we call the numinous spirit endure such extremes? If the spirit does not abide, it decays; if clarity does not reside, it dissipates—so what use is goodness then?

Those of old who understood the Dao were serene as unseasoned broth, guileless as an infant. They followed the push of circumstance and returned with its ebb, their essence pure and overflowing, as if lost yet ever-present. Their spirit was at ease, ever in counsel with the Dao. Free from envy and longing, who could fathom their ways?

Now you say: ‘Be vigilant in pursuing goodness’—but then with whom will the unvirtuous align? ‘Shun what you deem evil’—but then to whom will evil attach? If you reject what is offered and refuse what is returned, resentment will surely arise to stand against you. With your self-righteous intent confronting their indignant hearts, how can conflict not erupt? Once begun, strife will not cease—small quarrels escalate to insults and abuse, great ones to shattered skulls and pierced chests. If you cling to such words in hopes of remaining whole, you court peril indeed.”

Beigong Zi exclaimed: “Ah! Is it truly so dire?”

Zihua Zi replied: “It is worse still. Let me tell you: the origin of calamity, the wellspring of chaos, lies precisely in the desire for goodness and the aversion to evil. Today, the elders and masters of the world, clad in formal caps and sashes, preach this very doctrine—yet it summons disorder. Scholars, secluded in their chambers, devote themselves to this same pursuit—this is the path to ruin. Fathers, for this reason, grow unkind; sons, for this reason, grow undutiful; elder brothers, for this reason, grow unbrotherly; younger brothers, for this reason, grow disobedient; husbands, for this reason, grow unruly; wives, for this reason, grow disobedient; rulers, for this reason, grow unbenevolent; ministers, for this reason, grow disloyal. The great bonds of human relations rot and collapse, the threads of social order unravel and vanish—people rush toward this end as if racing to a goal, yet still fear they will not reach it soon enough. How tragic!

Shi Que sought to preserve his reputation and killed Hou; Prince Zhe sought to monopolize his state and resisted Kuai Kui; Wu Sheng overcame Duan; Hu fled only to force his way back in; Ji You poisoned Qing Fu; Shu Xiang executed Fu; Yong Tuo’s wife displayed Tuo’s corpse in the court; Zhuang or Shu plotted treachery. Zhong Zi sought refuge for his family in Lu but first destroyed his own household; Duke Li of Jin spoke a single word and executed the three Zhi brothers; Hua Du killed both Hu and Si—or was it Ao. The examples are too numerous to count. All claimed to seek what they desired and avoid what they despised—yet the great bonds still rotted, the threads of order still unraveled, and people rushed toward ruin as if fearing they would not arrive soon enough. How tragic!

Let me tell you: the origin of chaos, the wellspring of calamity, lies in the desire for goodness and the aversion to evil. When the human heart’s hollow center does not obtain what it desires, doubt arises; when it obtains what it does not desire, confusion follows. Doubt and confusion lodged within breed thorns of punishment. If a father does not doubt his son, the son will surely be filial; if an elder brother does not doubt his younger brother, the younger will surely be obedient; if a husband does not doubt his wife, she will surely be chaste; if a ruler does not doubt his minister, the minister will surely be loyal—these are reciprocal effects. A hundred tasks may be accomplished, but one act of doubt will derail the Dao; three may walk together, but one confused mind will stall all counsel.

In the age of the Great Dao, superiors and inferiors were transparent to one another, harboring no doubts. Yao and Shun, the kings of the Three Dynasties, did not set out to rule yet the world was ordered—what they followed was the straight path, and thus the world knew peace. The peace of the world arises from the peace of governance; the peace of governance arises from the peace of the people; the peace of the people arises from the peace of the heart. Peace is like a balance scale: add but a fraction of weight, and it tips. To bear what one does not desire is to double that weight. Thus it is said: those who boast of merit do not stand; those who harbor vain wishes do not succeed. Not only do they fail to gain fortune, but their actions invite disaster. Therefore, I do not delight in your words.

Now, if you simply cultivate inner peace and act with straightforwardness, where will you not succeed? What endeavor will you not achieve? What need is there for goodness? Moreover, goodness cannot be pursued as an act. Yao asked: ‘How can I make my affairs good?’ Shun likewise asked: ‘How can I make my affairs good?’ This is superiors and inferiors competing in goodness—two claims to reality. With two realities, how can there be peace? Without peace, how can there be uprightness? Lose the foundation of peace and uprightness, and Yao would not be Yao, nor Shun be Shun. You are diligent in emulating Yao and Shun—what need is there for goodness?”

Beigong Zi was in Wei, lodging with the Shu Che family. The Shu Che family enjoyed the favor of the Lord of Wei, and the people, resenting their arrogance, were preparing to punish them. Beigong Zi sighed deeply and said: “I have violated the Master’s teachings and thus brought this misfortune upon myself. Why remain in Wei?” He resigned his position as minister and returned home.

When Yan Zi governed the district of A for three years, slander reached the court. The lord was displeased and summoned him, intending to dismiss him. Yan Zi pleaded: “I recognize my faults. Please allow me to continue.” After another three years, the entire state praised him, and his reputation spread far and wide. The lord prepared to reward him, but Yan Zi declined. The lord asked: “What do you mean?” Yan Zi replied: “In the past, what I governed was what you should have taken credit for—yet I was blamed instead.”

Now, what I have governed is what you should have punished—yet I have received reward instead. This is not my true desire; I do not wish for it.”

Zihua Zi, upon hearing this, remarked: “Yan Zi may be called upright yet unyielding. His refusal of reward and acceptance of blame can serve as instruction. Qi’s decline was indeed fitting.

The common nature of man is to praise those who align with oneself, aid those who align with oneself, and love those who align with oneself. Yet the reverse of love must give rise to hatred, the reverse of aid must give rise to exclusion, and the reverse of praise must give rise to slander. Yet the lord does not examine this, and the ministers at his side, obtaining what they desire, are not restrained. Thus, the order or chaos of an age always hangs in the balance, and Qi’s decline was indeed fitting.”

Zihua Zi said: “The *yuan* is the central *qi* of the Great Beginning. The Heavenly Emperor obtains it and moves through endless cycles; the Earth Lord obtains it and spreads boundlessly. When man possesses *yuan*, it governs the hundred limbs. The ancients who created characters understood its principle, thus they established *yuan* as the ‘complete’ in ‘perfection,’ severed what was established as the ‘bandit’ in ‘banditry,’ and added the measure of law to form the ‘crown’ in ‘crowned bandit.’ Hence it is said: to damage what is established is called ‘banditry,’ and to destroy and harm is called ‘outlawry.’ As for piercing walls, burrowing holes, or prying open locks—these are but petty thefts.”

The Jin scholar Cheng Ben wrote.

Hǔ Huì inquired. Hǔ Huì, speaking from personal concern, asked Master Chéng: “What manner of lord is our ruler?” Master Chéng replied: “In the days when Yáo and Shùn reigned above, even the gossip of roadsides and the debates of alleyways were not suppressed. To affirm what is right and reject what is wrong—this is what defines a *shì*. Let me assay this for you, though I dare not take ancient affairs as proof. My late father, Wénzǐ, was a man whose will was thus: he loved learning and could accept admonition. He stood as though too frail to bear his robes, spoke as though words did not pass his lips. From humble dwellings he raised forty-six men, each of whom he won with his sincerity, and the state relied upon them. When he passed away, those forty-six men all took their places as guests of honor—such was his selfless virtue. To love learning is wisdom; to accept admonition is benevolence; to be free of private virtue is loyalty.

The source of the Jiāng River rises in Mount Wèn, its flow no wider than a jar’s mouth, its current barely enough to float a cup. Yet as it follows its course downward, it gathers the waters of all the Jīng rivers, spreading thousands of *lǐ* in breadth, so that only a great barge can cross it. This is no other reason than that what it receives from its lower reaches is not a single ravine. My late father, Wénzǐ, took this as his lesson. Thus he possessed filial virtue to emerge from the ducal clan, reverent virtue to ascend to office, martial virtue to decline the position of chief minister. By these means he brought radiance to the state of Jìn, aided his lord to prominence, and presided over the covenants of the Central States. The world relied upon his benevolence, and for nearly a decade no weapons were raised.

Now our ruler strives to display his merits and bring glory to the Zhào clan. He has no model but my late father, Wénzǐ. If he takes virtue as his standard and righteousness as his guide, expanding the brilliance of his legacy, he will earn renown throughout the Four Directions. As for the Fàn and Zhōngháng clans, they could not master themselves and thus brought ruin upon their ancestral ministers—this is something our ruler already knows.”

Hǔ Huì said: “Your words are most illuminating, Master. I would hear more.” He found an opportunity to present these matters to the ruler, hoping they might bring some remedy. Master Chéng said: “Does not the *Odes* say: ‘The king desires to make you a jewel, and so employs great remonstrance’? To correct his errant will and aid him in his aims—this is what a loyal minister must carefully consider. You must strive to act accordingly.”

I have heard it said: “Where mountains harbor fierce tigers, the forest thickets are not cleared; when rivers receive filth, all streams become stagnant.” Formerly, Duke Mù of Qín deemed Qín’s men insufficient. He raised Jiǎn Shū from Wǎn, welcomed Pī Pào from Zhèng, recruited Yóu Yú from the Róng, and plucked Bǎi Lǐ Xī from the marketplace. Strengthening his forces, he contended with Huì of Jìn. At that time, the state of Jìn was diminished, and all followed Qín. Thus a state relies upon its men as upon its sinews and bones—this cannot be overlooked.

Now, though our ruler has not yet achieved his aims, there is Dòu Shūzǐ, whom he has advanced by honoring his lineage; Shùn Huá, whom he has drawn near to remedy his shortcomings and set him to right governance; and Wúqiū Zhèn, whom he has deployed to extend his limbs as a steward of discipline. I have heard that Dòu Shūzǐ is a man of resolute strength and upright bearing, stern yet not abrasive. In serving his lord, he purifies himself with fasting and ablutions, his heart never wavering. Shùn Huá is learned and retentive, ashamed that his knowledge does not match the ancients. His arguments stand firm and cannot be shaken. Wúqiū Zhèn, at fifteen, first became known for his courage and strength. In his prime, neighboring lands feared him. He could hurl men as though they were toys, overturn chariots as though they were playthings. To him, the perilous heights of Tàiháng were but a step upon a mound. These three ministers are the finest in all of Jìn, the very men with whom our ruler strives to display his merits and bring glory to the Zhào clan.

The ducal house is now divided sixfold, and between the Hé and the mountains, the land is fractured like a tortoise’s shell, with rival powers standing firm. The Fàn and Zhōngháng clans could not protect their altars and brought ruin to their lineage—yet our ruler does not take this as an unalterable lesson, relying instead on the aid of these three ministers. Now, for no reason, he has executed Shūzǐ, and Shùn Huá has perished in the wild, his crimes unknown to the people. Wúqiū Zhèn, filled with dread, has fled to another state with provisions in hand. Has our ruler not considered this? How discordant are his beginnings and his ends! In this way, he distances himself from great achievement.

You are the ruler’s trusted minister. Who among us is without fault? But to err and then correct one’s heart—this is what even the sage fears. Now, if you do not shrink from trouble and apply your modest thoughts to admonishing the ruler’s oversights, the people of the state will rely upon you. Strive to act accordingly.”

Zǐhuà Zǐ was received by Duke Jǐng of Qí. The Duke asked: “How should one govern a state? What must be done to bring order?” Zǐhuà Zǐ replied: “In my foolish view, the state is not something to be ‘governed,’ nor are affairs something to be ‘ordered.’ To be intent upon governing is to be narrow; to be intent upon ordering is to be crude. One who possesses a state possesses a great thing, and what sustains it must be equally great. The narrow and the crude are truly unfit for such a task. In my foolish view, the state is not something to be ‘governed,’ nor are affairs something to be ‘ordered.’”

The Duke said: “Then is the state not to be governed at all?” Zǐhuà Zǐ replied: “It is not so. What I govern is the Dao. In governing through the Dao, it is profound yet not expansive. Reverently holding to the One, rectifying one’s nature and finding sufficiency within, the multitude does not scatter, yet each fulfills their single capacity. When all capacities are fully realized, the Four Borders are at peace. Only the signs of Heaven are not uniform, yet all share this same principle. This is how Shénnóng endured, how Yáo and Shùn flourished, and how the Xià sovereigns labored.

If a lord relies on his own wisdom and deems others foolish, on his own skill and deems others clumsy, then the foolish and clumsy will submit, while the skillful and wise will instruct.”

When decrees multiply, those who petition increase in number; when petitioners grow, there is nothing not petitioned. Though the lord be skillful and wise, he cannot know all things. To respond to what cannot all be petitioned with what cannot all be known—this Way is surely exhausted. If a lord is repeatedly exhausted by his subordinates, how can he rule over others? Exhausted yet unaware of his exhaustion, he will further deem himself abundant—this is what is called a state of double obstruction. Above, there is a ruler who shuns forthright speech; below, a custom of careless compliance. The calamity arises from the desire to act, the disaster stems from the wish to govern. To harbor the intent to act and govern yet incur the misfortune of double obstruction—this is why I, your foolish minister, deem the state not worth governing and affairs not worth ordering.

In the age when the Dao prevailed, one followed without acting, demanded without decreeing. Thoughts and intentions were set aside; stillness and emptiness awaited. Words were not boastful, affairs were not seized. Names were aligned with realities, officials managed their duties. To take "not knowing" as the Dao, to regard "what can be done" as treasure—thus Shénnóng asked: "How to harmonize the hundred things and regulate the Three Luminaries?" Yáo asked: "How to be illuminated by the sun and moon?" Shùn asked: "How to bring the lands beyond the Four Wastes into submission?" Yǔ asked: "How to govern the strange realms where the Nine Yangs of Qīngběi converge?" These rulers were deemed meritorious by the world, capable by later generations—hence their deeds are recorded in the annals, known to you, my lord.

Yet I, dull and unknowing, have but newly arrived at court and harbor doubts. What makes Qí Qí is, perhaps, something different. Bells and drums, prayers and invocations resound daily, yet harmonious tones are unheard. The Minister of Works’ blades and saws cut relentlessly, yet crimes and nets proliferate. The envoys of feudal lords anoint their lips, vying to offer flattery; those at court and beside the throne obscure the lord’s vision. Even menials and servants clearly perceive the lord’s hidden desires, crafting seductive songs to bewitch his heart—yet the lord remains unaware. Crowned and robed, he sits in the palace at dawn to hear petitions, sighing as he pairs himself with the ancients—his heart at ease. Who would dare, with a single humble offering, to test the lord’s preferences and risk his unfathomable wrath?

I, dull and unknowing, have but newly arrived at court and harbor doubts. Tracing the origins of this state, it stems from the lord’s heart overpowering all; when the heart prevails, the Dao cannot gather. The unworthy ministers follow and amplify it, so the corruption deepens daily, hardening like nature itself—yet the lord remains unaware. With your lordship’s clarity, if you would but dredge the stagnant and open the path toward the Dao, who could resist?

Moreover, I have heard: the transformations of the myriad things, the changes of the myriad affairs—these cannot be forced, cannot be fathomed. Yet if one follows their natural course and infers accordingly, nothing fails to attain its essence. Thus, I, your foolish minister, deem the state not worth governing and affairs not worth ordering.

The Duke said: “Your words flow abundantly, yet I wish to respond but find no place to set my words. Your Way is vast and boundless—I cannot emulate it. I have said: let there be something to correct my coarse mind.”

Zǐhuà Zǐ withdrew and dined at the Yàn residence. He then went to see Jì Shěn. Jì Shěn said: “Since I followed the Master, my tracks have not lingered in any of the four states, nor have I stayed a full year in one place. The Master, too, is weary and ailing. Alas, I am but a rustic, unversed in the Master’s capacity. The world has lost the Dao; black and white are muddled. Where will the Master steer his teachings? I grieve that I have a request yet dare not make it—may I seek your counsel?”

Zǐhuà Zǐ said: “So be it. Confucius is like Heaven—can he defy things and settle in place? Can he sever himself from things and act alone? If the sun and moon abandoned the cosmos, the four directions would surely lose their bearings. Confucius is the people’s plumb line. If Confucius’ tracks are weary, should one still fret over leisure?”

Jì Shěn said: “May I ask why you do not serve?”

Zǐhuà Zǐ said: “I am but a root—how can I aspire to the Master? The Master is like a square hub and round nave, boundless in possibility. I, however, have my limits. To follow the Master’s boundlessness with my own limits would be to trail behind. Thus, I act within my capacity.”

*Beginning of Scroll Five*

A man of Jin named Chéng Běn wrote:

Zǐhuà Zǐ said to Yàn Zǐ: “Between Heaven and Earth, there exists what is called ‘hidden punishment,’ yet none know of it. Those who know it are near the Dao.”

Yàn Zǐ said: “What do you mean?”

Zǐhuà Zǐ said: “When Heaven and Earth give birth to talent, it is truly difficult for them to bring it forth—it must have its use. How can one obstruct and conceal it, preventing it from taking root and standing firm? This is what Heaven and Earth most abhor, what the sun and moon illuminate, what yin and yang overturn, and what ghosts and spirits observe. Thus, in the canons of emperors and kings, those who promote the worthy receive the highest rewards, while those who fail to recommend men of talent are punished in person. To esteem the good and despise the evil—all this flows onward to later generations.

Consider this: among things that possess talent, their essence and brilliance are guarded and cherished by the numinous, hidden from the prying eyes of human effort. Gold is buried in sand, jade concealed in rough stone, and pearls born in the swirling depths of eddies and secluded coves. The great *yúzhāng* and *piánnán* trees, fit for grand construction, must grow in the vast mountains, deep valleys, and rugged, towering regions. They are pried free, torn loose, stripped bare—if they do not meet the proper measure, they face the transformations of tigers and wolves, dragons and serpents, or the perils of thunder and landslides, crushing collapse. Why? Because when Heaven and Earth give birth to talent, it is truly difficult for them to bring it forth—it must have its use. How can one obstruct and conceal it, preventing it from taking root and standing firm? This is called defying Heaven and profaning the luminous.

To defy Heaven and profane the luminous is to invite the wrath of the spirits. Though great, it will be broken; though blazing, it will be extinguished. It will wither and decay, collapse and perish—this is called ‘hidden punishment.’ Hidden punishment is the inverse of subtle retribution. It is like fitting a key to a lock, like pressing a seal into clay. It must match its kind, and its response is as swift as an echo.”

Yàn Zǐ said: “How astonishing are your words! I wish to hear more of what you have to say.”

Zǐhuà Zǐ said: “Sir, do not be overly surprised by what I have said. There is reason in my words. Now, the common nature of man is to hate slander and despise loss. Toward those he loves, he must harbor a steadfast heart. When this steadfast heart arises from inner emptiness and suddenly attacks what he cherishes most, he will surely rise in contention. If he contends and fails, his *qi* will falter and his will be broken. When *qi* falters and will is broken, rage will surge and fill his breast. When rage surges and fills his breast, he will have no equal in enmity.

Heaven and Earth, in giving birth to talent, cherish and treasure it deeply. How does their steadfast heart differ from the common nature of man? Yet the people of the world do not know this. They rely solely on their private desires and cunning schemes, whispering slander and crafting deep intrigues, scheming to outdo others. But what does it mean for a man to outdo others? The mirror of Heaven and Earth, the illumination of the numinous—these are most fearsome, most terrifying. If one’s *qi* falters and will is broken, rage surges and fills the space between Heaven and Earth, gathering into the punishments of yin and yang, then its impact on man will be dire. This is an inevitable outcome, not something to be wondered at.

Alas! The people of the world do not know this. Those who know it are near the Dao. As for me, I am but a rustic from Jin, yet I have learned of these things from old records. In former times, when the late Grand Master Yuè Wǔzǐ held office, he served day and night with reverence, correcting wrongs and favoring the upright. He never neglected his duties, following his lord faithfully. His illustrious reputation spread, recorded in the annals of the feudal lords. But when his successor took power, he was not of the same mind. He abandoned his duties to exalt himself, clung to favor and monopolized power, cast aside men of talent, and schemed for personal gain. The people of the state loathed him as if he were a speck in their eyes. Day by day, his will turned, hastening his punishment—thus the Yuè clan perished.

In former times, when the late Grand Master Suí Wǔzǐ held office, he was enlightened and far-seeing, a venerable elder of Jin. Yet he remained humble, saying: ‘There are things I have not seen,’ ‘There are things I do not know,’ ‘There are things I have not heard.’ He recorded his thoughts at night and presented them to the court each day. Thus, no talent in Jin was overlooked. He was able to shine brightly and establish himself in the court, and his descendants—fathers, sons, and brothers—served as the state’s chief ministers for generations. But when his successor took power, he was arrogant and self-satisfied, craftily concealing his true intentions. He destroyed foundations and blocked sources, worse than a viper’s gaze, favoring only flatterers and petty men. The wise kept their distance, and the good concealed themselves in obscurity. Day by day, his will turned, hastening his punishment—thus the Fàn clan perished.

In former times, when the late Grand Master Zhōngháng Wénzǐ held office, he recognized and promoted the outstanding, revitalizing those who had languished. When men possessed skill and ability, he treated it as if it came from himself. He was reverent and untiring, devoting all his strength, and thus was able to assist his lord in forging alliances with the feudal lords. But when his successor took power, he took harshness for discernment, deceit for wisdom, cruelty for loyalty, scheming for goodness, and greed for virtue. He broke horns and snapped teeth, fearing others would encroach upon him. His gate was as bustling as a marketplace, and he saw only profit. Flatterers seized opportunities to curry favor, indulging his worst impulses. Like ghosts and goblins, they led him further astray. Day by day, his will turned, hastening his punishment—thus the Zhōngháng clan perished.”

These three lords were hereditary ministers of the state of Jin—so-called lofty and unshifting lineages—whose former grand ministers all possessed profound virtue to ingratiate themselves with the spirits above and below. Yet when their successors came to power, they abandoned and neglected their predecessors’ teachings, thereby overturning their ancestral temples and severing their lines of succession. Their forebears’ spirits were left to starve, denied the blood offerings of Jin, for no other reason than this: relying on their prosperity, strength, and flourishing multitudes, they scorned principle, defied Heaven by trusting in men, and harbored malice within to violate the reverent constancy of Heaven and Earth—thus their cruelty reached such extremes.

As for those upstart clans and lesser families who usurp others’ ranks and emoluments, coveting fleeting fortune, they grow idle and suspicious, ever fearful that others may surpass them. Before the boundaries of doubt and certainty are clarified, before the distinctions between agreement and dissent are settled, they obstruct and blind, preventing others from taking root and standing firm. Their calamities will surely be even graver than those of Jin’s three lords.

Those who build walls and ramparts focus on height but neglect their substance; though they may rise to towering heights, their foundations will collapse.

Those who cover others’ wisdom and insight with their two hands, believing themselves to have gained advantage, do not realize that the afflictions of deafness and blindness have already shifted to themselves. How lamentable—is this not cause for profound sorrow?

Master Yan said: “How shocking these words are! Without you, sir, I would have heard nothing of this.” He then requested that they be carved upon his belt-hook as a reminder never to forget.

Master Yan asked Master Zihua: “The ducal house of Qi fears its decline—what is to be done?”

Master Zihua replied: “Where human desire exists, Heaven must follow. If Qi seeks its own decline, what fear is there that it will not obtain it? In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor had twenty-five clans, and thus the Yellow Prosperity spread throughout the world—even now, it has not been forgotten. When the royal house of Zhou reigned, the fiefdoms of the Ji lineage numbered seventy in all. Just as a finger cannot command the arm, so too can the arm not move the body. Now, since the time of Dukes Xiang and Huan, Qi has seen its court devoid of ducal clans and its fields bereft of ducal lands. Those who bear armor and wield weapons, who grasp the hub and fight—are not of the ducal retainers. Those who knot their sashes and trail their robes, who hold rank and occupy office—are not of the ducal ministers. The sons and grandsons of the ducal house have scattered to the four directions, reduced to mingling with mere servants. What the duke shares with them are only those who possess their own hearts and minds.

As the *Odes* says:
*Are there no others?*
*None are like those of my own clan.*
How then can they stand alone and presume to rule over others? If Qi seeks its own decline, what fear is there that it will not obtain it?”

Now, men of today divide wealth and goods and devise schemes of hooks and reins—not because such schemes can truly achieve fairness, but to ensure that resentment over good and ill, much and little, finds no target.

Thus the sage exhausts the workings of creation to establish measures, yet still relies on turtle-shell divination and milfoil stalks for decisions, thereby grounding speech in impartiality. Sound issues in accord with pitch-pipes, the body moves in harmony with standards, yet still weights and measures, foot-rules and stone-weights are employed to instruments, thereby grounding rectitude in impartiality. Principles align with reason and instruction, and none under heaven dare harbor dissent, yet still written contracts and statutes serve as models, thereby grounding trust in impartiality. Virtue and grace flow boundlessly, awe and control extend far, encompassing all within the four seas without exception, yet still laws, regulations, and ritual codes serve as norms, thereby grounding rightness in impartiality.

But Qi does otherwise: all that governs the state arises from private interest. Nor is this the limit—it publicly gathers resentment while privately enjoying the benefits; publicly bears the name while privately reaps the substance. Qi’s decline into private hands has not been a matter of a single day. Thus, if Qi seeks its own abasement, what fear is there that it will not obtain it?

Master Zihua said: In the laws established by the former kings, there were fundamental extensions and secondary measures. They followed these without innovation, upheld them without fabrication, eliminating excess and desire, sharing governance with the four seasons, and unifying standards with cold and heat. Without speech, the people were transformed by them; without commands, the people submitted to them. Thus, those who could follow achieved greatness, and those who could uphold achieved stability.

To harbor intentions in the minutiae of lawmaking is to carve away at the true origins of the law. Law is but the coarse trace of ordering the world—it cannot accommodate personal designs, much less the cultivation of the Dao and its arts.

As the *Tradition* states: Follow the principles of the Dao’s workings to assist the natural course of the myriad things, and the six directions will not suffice to encompass their evenness. The seventy-nine generations of rulers, though their laws differed, all reigned over the world by means of this Way.

Yanzi Inquires About Factions

Yanzi paid an audience to Master Zihua and said: "The other day, I was granted an audience with the Duke. The Duke detests the formation of factions among his ministers and asked, ‘What method might you employ to eliminate them?’ I had no answer. I humbly seek your instruction on what I have failed to grasp, and I shall receive it with an open mind."

Master Zihua replied: "Alas! That the ruler should utter such words—Qi is in peril indeed. The reason wandering scholars cannot establish themselves at the ruler’s court is precisely because factions ruin them. When the ruler deeply detests factions, the ministers who serve at his side find pretext to exploit it. Those ministers, having entrenched themselves deeply in favor and rooted their authority firmly, form alliances of deceit and sworn loyalty. They weave a web of separation and entanglement, ensuring that unless one is of their kind, even the slightest divergence bars one from standing among them. Scholars who pride themselves on purity and integrity—who would willingly abandon their clarity to follow others into obscurity, as if fearing contamination? They will not be tolerated. Thus, the ministers at the ruler’s side seize upon their uprightness and slander them daily as factionalists. The ruler, failing to examine this, indulges his deep aversion, and so banishment, execution, and humiliation follow. Scholars of integrity may pare themselves down to the barest means of self-preservation, subsisting on a single basket of food, yet who would willingly cast their priceless selves into the ruler’s certain wrath? Alas! That the ruler should utter such words—Qi is in peril indeed.

When petty men first arrived in Qi, those who differed even slightly were not tolerated; now, even those suspected of resemblance are erased from the record. When petty men first arrived in Qi, the pliant and obsequious were not necessarily employed; now, they don the court robes and ride in carriages. Petty men have been in Qi but a short time, yet the changes are already so profound—Qi’s decline has only just begun. The ruler fails to examine this, while the ministers at his side, seizing upon his hatred of factions, dismantle the integrity of wandering scholars. Soon, the entire court of Qi will be transformed into their private retainers. Days pass and months change, altars rise within the palace precincts, and the ruler remains unaware. Alas! That the ruler should utter such words—Qi is in peril indeed."

Master Zihua then said to Yanzi: "Governance has its signs—have you heard of them, my lord?"

Yanzi replied: "I would hear them from you."

Master Zihua said: "In the governance of antiquity, the ruler’s will was upright and cultivated. His ministers shared virtue and aligned in righteousness without divergent hearts. The court had no undeserved positions, and affairs suffered no neglect. Beyond the four wilds, plows followed what was fitting, and ditches and furrows were dug for convenience. The people were compliant and followed the law, distant yet without transgression. Above and below, all deferred to the ruler’s judgment. Vital qi was subdued and calamities did not arise; the four neighbors laid down their arms, and jade tablets and silk gifts affirmed his authority. What is this if not the sign of good governance?

Now, in Qi, forthright speech is unheard, wisdom is not awakened, the court is clogged and uncleared, the wilds lie fallow and famine recurs. Qi has strayed far from the signs of governance, and there are no ranks left to convey remonstrance. As the saying goes: When the lower ranks have no voice, it is called muteness; when the upper ranks hear nothing, it is called deafness. A deaf and mute court—above, the ruler indulges his will, while below, many taboos arise. This describes Qi.

Moreover, combining sheng, shao, yue, and ge measures fills the bushel; the granary is complete. The height of Mount Tai is not the accumulation of a single stone; the vastness of the Eastern Sea at Langye is not the gathering of one stream. Thus, governing a state and the world is not the work of a single scholar’s words. Yet in Qi, those who hold office—are they not deluded? They take ink for brightness, a fox for gray, turn one into two, and two into three, and the Duke cannot restrain them. They cultivate factions and shield their allies, envy those ahead and expel the solitary. The pliant and obsequious appear daily before the ruler, secure in favor and relying on convenience, and the Duke cannot restrain them.

It is like buying a horse: if one ignores its strength and judges only by color, markings, and coat, then there will be no swift steeds. It is like selling jade: if one ignores its purity, warmth, and flawlessness and judges only by size and breadth, then there will be no jades worth a city in one’s casket. So too with scholars: if one judges them not by their talent but by their status and position, then Yi Yin and Guan Zhong would not stand in the court.

Moreover, Qi is a state that fronts the sea and leans against the mountains, vast in its expanse and hidden in its corners. Its roads extend in all directions, connecting everywhere. It is a place where wandering scholars gather. Yet now, those the ruler of Qi is accustomed to and familiar with are none but the private retainers of Bao Guo or the faction of Cui and Tian. Wandering scholars have nowhere to plant their feet. With no place to stand, they grasp the crossbar and turn their wheels away. When wandering scholars depart, the signs of good governance vanish with them.

As the saying goes: In the poorest villages, the offerings at their shrines consist of no more than a cup of wine and a morsel of meat. At the altars of a ruined state, prayers for blessings are not difficult to make. Now, Qi’s decline is severe. Those who wish to govern it do not match half the worth of the ancients, yet their achievements are barely sufficient. You, sir, attend the Duke of Qi morning and night, yet you still cling so stubbornly to self-preservation that you do not offer even a word of warning to rouse him. Your benevolence is too constrained."

Yanzi said: "Well said. Without you, I would have heard nothing of this. In serving the Duke, I am but a dog or swine of a minister. If I heed your words, I will have committed an offense."

Yanzi asked Zihua Zi, saying: "Do the sagely ones esteem frugality? Is this recorded in the *Traditions*?"

Zihua Zi replied: "It is. Frugality is the treasure of the sagely ones, the instrument by which they govern the world, what the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors bequeathed for scrutiny."

Yanzi said: "I have heard that Yao did not deem earthen steps base, and the Lord of Yu was vigilant against lacquered walls. Is this what is meant by esteeming frugality?"

Zihua Zi said: "What does the minister mean by 'frugality'? Frugality lies within, not without; it resides in the self, not in things. When the heart dwells in centered emptiness to govern the five senses, when essence and qi stir and transform in harmonious flux, when one restrains what is expended and carefully moderates what is received—then the spirit’s abode is tranquil and settled, and essence remains unshaken. One’s discernment of things becomes clear, and one’s conduct in affairs becomes firm. This is what is called frugality, what the sagely ones treasure, the instrument by which they govern the world, what the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors bequeathed for scrutiny. What does the minister mean by 'frugality'?

To measure expenditure by income is the duty of the granary officer; to manage surplus by controlling profit is the work of the merchant’s son. For the common household, food is apportioned by the number of mouths—this is the aspiration of the village lane. But as for the Son of Heaven, his is the great palace; he who possesses all under heaven holds the great vessel. He oversees the myriad ranks, governs the myriad people, exhausts the products of heaven, depletes the resources of earth, and nothing is not supplied, nothing is not prepared—this is the enduring authority of past and present. How can one look up and judge the measure of Yao and Shun by the aspirations of the village lane, the conduct of the merchant’s son, or the duties of the granary officer?

This is what pedantic scholars cling to, the means by which vulgar customs deceive one another. The talk of earthen steps and lacquered walls is what rustics praise, but it is not transmitted in the *Traditions*. I have heard that Yao dwelled in the palace of the thoroughfare, his robes hanging loose with folded hems, his presence as profound as the abode of the divine. He assembled the five jades to receive the feudal lords, and those who came bearing tribute and entered to pay homage were like stars clustering around the North Star—Yao remained as if he had always possessed them.

Shun strolled upon the towering galleries, clad in a single-layered robe, plucking the five-stringed zither. The sun and moon were embroidered upon his great banner, the twelve insignia complete, their black and yellow patterns resplendent. When he went forth, bells and chimes followed; when he moved, pendants and rings chimed. His steps and strides accorded with the rhythm of the *Jiaoshao*—Shun, too, remained as if he had always possessed them.

Such was the completeness of Yao and Shun’s possessions—how could there have been anything like three-foot earthen steps or thatched roofs left unfinished? How could there have been lacquered walls to startle and warn themselves? This is what pedantic scholars cling to, the means by which vulgar customs deceive one another, and thus it is not spoken of in the *Records*.

Jie and Zhou lost all under heaven not because of extravagance, but because of their lack of benevolence. To guard against extravagance is where ritual resides; where ritual resides, one may reduce or augment as circumstances allow. How could one, having surveyed the tribute of the four seas and received the governance of the nine regions, then dwell in a palace of earthen steps or fear to apply lacquer to the walls? It must certainly be otherwise."

Moreover, the institutions of the former kings decreed that when jade insignia were altered, so too were one’s conduct; banners, streamers, crowns, and regalia were displayed to mark the ranks of ascent and descent. Now, in this degenerate age, people are unversed in ritual: those in high station encroach upon the lowly, and those in great position trespass upon the small. When one of utmost impartial honor employs bondservants for personal service, how can those beneath endure it? This is not merely a matter of coarseness in one’s own person, but also leaves nothing to bestow upon one’s kin and clan, nor to enrich one’s ancestral temples. To say, “I practice frugality in this way,” is this not the way of the Yi and Mo barbarians?

Master Yan said: “Excellent. Without you, sir, I would have had nothing to hear.” In the end, he dared not argue for austerity.

*Zihua zi*, Scroll Six

*Zihua zi*, Scroll Seven
A work by Cheng Ben of Jin.

Master Zhong spoke.

*Zihua zi* said: The sage values the center, the noble person guards the center—the Dao of the center is nearly perfect. Though six fingers may sprout from a single palm, the center remains between them; though extremes are established at both ends, the center is never abolished. Thus, the center is never exhausted.

The petty person indulges in recklessness, delighting in exhausting the nature of things to the utmost of their grasp. The calamities they suffer must be severe. Why say this? When the Vermilion Brightness (summer) is overly prolonged, it cannot fully express its warmth without being followed by the withering, gathering *qi* of autumn. When the Dark Warrior (winter) is excessively cold, it cannot fully express its frigidity without being followed by the spreading, flourishing *qi* of spring. Who brings this about? Heaven. If even Heaven cannot exhaust itself, how much less can man?

Therefore, if one can truly proceed by way of the center—whether veering left or right, though one may overstep the center, one remains within its courtyard; whether advancing or retreating, though one may fall short of the center, one remains within its hall—then one is not far from it. But when the petty person delights in exhausting all, they distance themselves from the center. Distanced from the center, they must become constrained at the edges and tear apart; they must strike against sheer walls and fall prostrate; they must plunge into pits and perish. It is like hurling a stone into an abyss—it will not stop until it reaches the bottom.

Alas! The Way of Heaven abhors exhaustion, yet the benighted do not know this. The noble persons of old purified their hearts with fasting and vigil, holding fast to the center without daring to lose it—was this not what they meant by the center? Though Heaven and Earth press down from above, the center is not worn away; though yin and yang intermingle, the center is not altered; though the five colors—black and yellow—chaotically swirl before one’s eyes, the center is not lost.

Alas! The petty persons of this world gratify their desires in but a fleeting moment, yet swiftly lose what makes them centered. They endanger their states and forfeit their lives without early awakening. Even when moved to sorrow by the center, they cling to it as to a wooden post, yet still do not awaken early—these are called the lowest of fools, those who cannot be moved or transformed.

*Zihua zi* said: The essential *qi* of Heaven—its great reckoning—constantly emerges as three and enters as one. In man, it issues forth with exhalation and enters with inhalation. Thus, one is called *unity*; two, *pairing*; three, *transformation*. Unity is *talent*; pairing is *capacity*; transformation is *spirit*. All essential *qi* is completed through three, for three is the number of completion. Fu Xi and the Yellow Emperor wielded it in their calculations; Heshu and Datíng dwelled in vagueness, as if something had been left behind. Thus it is said: emerging from one, standing upon two, completing in three. *Lianshan* reveals form through it; *Guicang* governs *qi* through it; the *Great Change* establishes numbers through it.

*Zihua zi* said: What the Dao bears forth—four expanses, vast as cliffs. All who have feet tread upon them. Why? Because they are level.

Vast and boundless, it embraces all without exclusion—one with two, two with three, I know not how they naturally converge yet call it *level*. Why? Because it is *empty*. Only emptiness can gather the Dao; only levelness can bear the Dao. Unobstructed, without contrivance—this is the perfection of emptiness. Neither leaning left nor tilting right, without preference for good or aversion to evil, like a suspended scale—this is the perfection of levelness.

Between the two chambers of the heart, how much can they contain? Yet traverse rugged peaks and cliffs, cross the Taihang and Yanmen’s towering barriers—even the pass of the numinous terrace cannot admit a ladle of water, so how can it hold anything? Desires scorch it; likes and dislikes freeze it. When fire and ice wage war, they must wound each other. Thus, the four limbs stretch and split; the stomach fills and swells; thin *qi* brings muteness; fear induces madness; accumulated sorrow harms the heart, and the heart’s *qi* burns away.

Therefore it is said: with emptiness and levelness, the Dao arises of itself; with levelness and emptiness, the Dao abides of itself.

*Zihua zi* said: The king delights in what makes him king; the doomed delight in what dooms them. Cooking beasts cannot exhaust them all, but craving their dried meat nearly does. The king has a taste for principle and righteousness; the doomed have a taste for violence and arrogance. Their tastes differ, so their fortunes differ as well.

*Zihua zi* said: Life is the counterpart of death; having is the opposite of nothing. Depletion is the cause of fullness; deficiency is the beginning of completion. The Great Dao has no form, no number, no name, no substance. By having no substance, it has no life or death; by having no name, it has no being or non-being; by having no number, it has no height or lowness; by having no form, it has no completion or deficiency. Once confined to the four images, nothing can avoid destruction. Thus, though leather is supple, stretching it will tear it; though ore is hard, striking it will shatter it. Hard and soft, heavy and light, large and small, long and short—though different, they share the same end. Thus, the ancients designed characters: when a character was split, its form followed suit.

*Zihua zi* said: The days of a celestial cycle number three hundred and sixty; the months of a lunar cycle number three hundred and sixty. The great numbers of heaven and earth do not exceed this. The creatures of the five directions share the same tally: the scaled creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the Azure Dragon of the Zhen Palace as their chief; the feathered creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the Vermilion Bird of the Li Palace as their chief; the furred creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the Qilin of the Dui Palace as their chief; the shelled creatures number three hundred and sixty, with the Hidden Tortoise of the Kan Palace as their chief; the naked creatures number three hundred and sixty, filling the cosmos, with man as their chief.

A single human body has three hundred and sixty bones, where essence and fluids circulate day and night, where breath is exhaled and inhaled, where the heart’s intentions and thoughts are known, where hands and feet move and fingers and thighs bend and stretch—all in harmony with the great numbers of heaven and earth, forming a single whole. Thus it is said: among all between heaven and earth, man is most noble.

*Zihua zi* said: Striking a bell of tempered bronze, the six harmonies resound in the courtyard to express joy—yet one burdened by hidden sorrow grows only more mournful, for joy does not govern their heart. Chanting while pacing in gloom, plucking taut strings in haste to express sorrow—yet one at peace grows only more joyful, for sorrow does not govern their heart. Thus, joy and sorrow lie outside; what governs them lies within. The inner stirrings alter one’s complexion, shift one’s bearing, yet the dull do not perceive it. Therefore it is said: one who gazes at flowing water flows with it—do their eyes turn and their heart depart?

*Zihua zi* said: The primordial chaos of *hunlun hongmeng* is the Dao’s foundation. All-encompassing and all-embracing, this is heaven’s greatness. Radiant and luminous, this is the emperor’s achievement. The Dao does not favor; heaven does not deviate; the emperor does not choose—then where does the heart dwell? The heart of the Dao is heaven; the heart of heaven is the emperor; the heart of the emperor is man. Nothing in man’s heart is more hidden than compassion, nothing more fitting than forbearance. When a crawling infant moves me to pity, it is because compassion lies hidden within. Crossing waves to aid those ahead, trudging through mire to look back at those behind—this is the convenience of forbearance. If this heart is not lost, one can serve the emperor, reach heaven, and enter the Dao. If this heart is not preserved, the Dao departs, heaven opposes, and the emperor punishes.

The ancients who designed characters made *this heart* into *compassion* (慈) and *like the heart* into *forbearance* (恕). Without this heart, one loses their kind and falls into sorrow. Thus, those who grasp principles to govern the people are often slighted and ignored.

*Zihua zi* said: All things that have a source are how affairs mutually depend, how principles mutually affirm. The axle is the axle, and thus the cart moves in relation; the thread is the thread, and thus thoughts connect in sequence. The origin of lineage is how clans have distinctions; the pomelo of citrus is how flavors have differences. The *zhou* of the cosmos is how principles are transmitted. The lushness of grain is how harvests ripen; the drifting of clouds is how rain descends. A troubled heart stirs, and thus the heart moves; left turns and right withdrawals are how armies halt. Thus, all things that have a source are how affairs mutually depend and principles mutually affirm.

**Scroll Eight of *Zihua zi***
*Recorded by Cheng Ben of Jin*

**The Great Dao**
*Zihua zi* said: The Great Dao has a source, and its source is most true, named "Void-Pervading."
Void-Pervading is non-being, from which the Three Origins arise.
The work of the Three Origins stands together in the Profound.
When held vertically, they are called the Three Poles;
when deployed horizontally, they are called the Three Principles.
When they penetrate above and below, they are called the Three Powers.
Where the One is accomplished, the ten thousand principles arise;
where the One governs, the ten thousand existences are stored.
Thus, "Void" means nothing is not prepared;
"Pervading" means nothing is not contained.
The source of the Great Dao is most true—
nothing fails to receive its endowment,
nothing fails to accept its bestowal,
nothing fails to be measured by it.
Vast, it extends without boundary;
subtle, it permeates without gap.
It bestows and endows without impoverishment,
responds and reciprocates without expenditure.
Thus it is said: "Through unity, all affairs are complete."
This is what it means.

*Zihua zi* said: Look up, and the Profound is there;
look down, and the Profound is there.
Move in all four directions, and the Profound is there.
Face it and gaze, and the Profound looms before you;
lift your feet in haste, turn away and flee, and the Profound stares behind you.
Thus, the Profound is nowhere it is not.
If one can guard the Profound, the Profound guards them;
if one cannot guard the Profound, the Profound abandons them.

*Zihua zi* said: Fire dwells in the heart, flaring upward and pressing downward—its spirit is restless and without constancy.
Those who are hasty and reckless in bringing disaster upon themselves are moved by the heart.
Wood dwells in the liver, clashing, thrusting, and butting—its spirit is constrained and without measure.
Those who are blunt and stubborn in bringing disaster upon themselves are moved by the liver.
Metal dwells in the lungs, resounding and unyielding, hollow yet unable to rise—its spirit is careless and without method.
Those who are rash and decisive in bringing disaster upon themselves are moved by the lungs.
Water dwells in the kidneys, shrinking and converging toward peril—its spirit lies hidden and does not emerge.
Those who are pliant and obsequious in bringing disaster upon themselves are moved by the kidneys.
Earth dwells in the spleen, ponderous and inexhaustible—its seepage flows downward without cease, its spirit favors grandeur yet achieves nothing.
Those who are sluggish and hesitant in bringing disaster upon themselves are moved by the spleen.
Fire’s qi delights in brightness; wood’s qi delights in openness; metal’s qi delights in discernment; water’s qi conceals; earth’s qi engenders.
Thus, in serving the heart, one should act with filial piety;
in serving the liver, with righteousness;
in serving the kidneys, with wisdom;
in serving the spleen, with sincerity and without deceit.
When the Five Elements lodge in what they delight,
and the Five Affairs are administered according to what is fitting,
external perils do not enter,
and inner essence does not leak—
this is called "perfect completion."

*Zihua zi* said: How extreme it is—the way people fix their gaze on appearances!
How can the eyes be trusted?
Consider a person of beauty and grace, whom all delight in—
yet if you cover them with a tattered hood, those who see them will flee in disgust.
But if you clothe them in fine silk and gauze, those who once fled will now linger.
How extreme it is—the way people fix their gaze on appearances!
How can the eyes be trusted?

*Zhou She* said to *Zihua zi*: I have heard that if one cultivates oneself yet fails to establish a name, there is no point in choosing a path.
If a hundred delicacies are heaped upon the table yet one’s appetite does not stir, there is no point in prizing fine food.
If one clutches a jade disk and begs in vain, there is no point in valuing treasures.
May I ask: what is the aim of aspiration?

*Zihua zi* said: Indeed.
A pot cannot hold what it cannot contain;
a measuring rope cannot reach what it cannot extend to.
The grand music of *Juntian* does not halt passing birds;
painted pillars and carved beams do not deter gibbons and monkeys.
A circle moves while a square rests—this is their differing natures.
Fire blazes while water flows—this is the result of habit.
Now, to judge the aims of aspiration from the position you occupy is surely discordant.
If there is no recourse, then there is one thing I would offer:
The Six Voids contain a qi of pure and perfect beauty,
yet it does not dare to transmit itself.
It entrusts itself to things to express its resonance,
flows its form into the ten thousand existences,
yet does not dare to act as if it possesses anything.
Let us attempt to discuss its subtleties:
What is fair and lovely may be fragile,
while the ugly is firm and enduring.
A jade wall shatters easily,
yet metal and iron are difficult to smelt.
How extreme it is—the way things cannot be made whole in this manner!
They cannot be grasped by one method,
nor achieved by one skill.
Only those who know the Dao come close to preserving wholeness.
Now, you in your youth cultivated refinement and sincerity;
in maturity, you stood tall and established yourself.
You seek to raise your brilliance as a target for others.
Your resolve in facing hardship is firm,
your assessment of things is narrow,
and you proceed directly and headlong,
defying what others do not desire while striving to stand alone.
This is a hollow reputation of no use—
it is not something I can comprehend.

The eye’s clarity may see a hundred paces afar, yet it cannot glimpse its own back—only what lies beyond the wall remains unseen. If there were no such limitation, there would be unity. Thus, I venture to present this offering.

Master Zihua said: The myriad things are profoundly the same—who is right, and who is wrong? Who knows their beginning? Who knows their end? I cannot grasp their underlying principle, so I call it the One. The One is the ancestor of all existence. The Dao attains it and calls it the Great One; Heaven attains it and calls it Heavenly One; the Emperor attains it and calls it Imperial One.

The Imperial One stands at the center of the circle—strike it, and no echo is heard; inhale its scent, and no fragrance is found. Vast and indistinct, it seems to contain all things, yet serene, as if it had never departed from its origin. Boundless, as if without end.

The Heavenly One acts without controlling, accomplishes without possessing. It is the source from which the mechanism emerges and the point to which it returns.

The Great One encompasses all things. It transforms one into two, two into three, and from three brings forth the ten thousand things. Thus it is said: The One’s transformation is vast—present in three as three, present in nine as nine. Though the ten thousand things differ, they are governed by one art. Master this art, and nothing remains unknown; fail to grasp it, and nothing can be known.

Therefore, the numbers of sound, color, scent, and taste do not exceed five. When the five are established upon the One, the One stands, and the ten thousand things arise.

Master Zihua said: The changes of cold, damp, warmth, dryness, darkness, and light are vast. When form clings to transformation, it withers, yet its essence remains inexhaustible. The transformations of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, thought, and fear are complete. When spirit is entangled in change, it withers, yet its form persists in excess.

When the upright *qi* resides in a person, it flows up and down, circulating like a ring without end, beyond measure or limit. It enables the spirit to flourish, vibrant and unyielding, and the body to dwell in wholeness, steadfast and unshaken. Thus, those who master the art of nurturing *qi* must devote themselves to purity.

If *qi* is not victorious, evil will assail it. If the assault continues unchecked, *qi* will be subdued; if the subjugation persists, it will verge on dissipation. As upright *qi* wanes, evil arts flourish. The heart is wounded within, and complexion alters outwardly; spirit departs from its vessel, and death follows.

Therefore, the ancients who knew the Dao built ramparts to ward off evil, cleared channels to nurture the true, dwelled in stillness, and avoided disturbance by external things. In movement and rest, in going out and coming in, they harmonized with spirit and *qi*. They guarded their ethereal and corporeal souls, sealed their orifices, focused without distraction, and preserved their true *qi*. Up and down, it flowed unimpeded, like water in its course, like the sun and moon in their ceaseless motion. Yin nourished the storehouses, Yang fortified the palaces. The source surged abundantly, full yet not overflowing, deep yet not shallow. This is what is called enduring life.

Master Zihua said: Human nature is like water. The source of water is inherently pure and free from decay or filth. Yet what it is steeped in over time cannot remain unchanged. Once altered, it cannot return to its original state, and one may doubt whether it retains its true nature. Thus, whether square or round, crooked or bent, water takes the shape of what it encounters. Whether blue, yellow, red, or white, it adopts the color of what it receives. Whether crashing, roaring, trickling, or spraying, it alters its sound according to what obstructs it. Whether swirling, surging, flowing, or pooling, it changes its form based on its container. Whether salty, bland, fragrant, or foul, its taste shifts with what taints it. These five transformations are not the nature of water, yet they define what water’s nature becomes. Thus, the noble person of old was cautious about what he allowed to steep within.

Master Zihua said: Among the great numbers of Heaven and Earth, none surpass five, none are more central than five. Five resides in the central palace, governing the ten thousand kinds. It is the fullness of the stomach, the guardian of the primordial *qi*, the origin of rising and the anchor of stillness. It is the reason tortoise and milfoil divination are efficacious, the source of the spirit’s abundant resonance.

Master this, and one moves freely without obstruction. Thus, two and four embrace nine to ascend, while six and eight tread upon one to descend. Nine is worn upon the head, one is trodden underfoot; three is grasped, and seven is held. Five dwells in the central palace, the wellspring from which numbers arise. One vertical stroke and one horizontal stroke complete the formation of numbers. Therefore, it is said: Among the great numbers of Heaven and Earth, none surpass five, none are more central than five. Master this, and one moves freely without obstruction.

*Master Zihua, Scroll Nine*

Beigong Yi questioned:

In the age of high antiquity, Heaven did not withhold its treasures. Thus, sun and moon shone pure and radiant, the five planets followed their appointed paths without deviation, phoenixes arrived, divine tortoises revealed their omens, sweet dew descended, bamboo bore fruit in abundance, flowing yellow emerged, and vermilion grasses sprouted. May I ask what cultivation and conduct brought about such a state?

Master Zihua replied: This differs from what I have heard.

Auspicious omens and portents—though their presence may fulfill the tally, their absence does not diminish governance. The sage-kings took no notice of them; the noble person did not speak of them. They were absent in well-ordered ages.

In the age of high antiquity, dwellings were made with emptiness, governance with restraint. What they shared with others was their use of things; what set them apart was their spirit’s illumination. The movement of this illumination was exceedingly subtle in its origin, yet direct in its effects. It swayed with change, shifted with transformation. Yin and yang could not reverse it; the four seasons could not impair it. It penetrated the realm of the infinitesimal, traversed the court of the indistinct, drawn from without depletion, poured into without overflow.

To them, phoenixes and qilin were but creatures raised in pens; to them, limpid essences and sweet dew were but streams diverted.

To them, the rare growths of lingzhi chambers and bamboo fruits, all the marvels among grasses and trees, were but the produce of garden plots; to them, jades and strange stones, all the curious varieties of their kind, were but the contents of chests and cases. Thus it is said: the sage-kings took no notice of them; the noble person did not speak of them. They were absent in well-ordered ages.

In former times, the Lord of Yu strummed his five-stringed zither and sang the *Ode of the Southern Wind*, and his radiance spread to the four quarters, reaching above and below. When the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, rare delicacies were never removed from before him, bells and drums never unstrung from their frames, yet he chanted the *Yong* and intoned the *Shao*, and the six domains submitted to his virtue. As for all the auspicious omens and responsive signs, their presence sufficed to complete the tally, while their absence did not detract from good governance.

After the sage-kings passed away, the world fell into great disorder: fathers and sons turned coarse in nature, rulers and ministers lost their proper order—nothing has been worse than the present age. Yet the sun, moon, and stars still array themselves in the heavens above, no different from well-ordered times. Thus it is said: the Way of Heaven is distant, the way of man is near. To await milfoil and tortoise for auspicious omens is but the least of blessings. To stumble and bow in supplication is to rely on meager support.

Thus it is said: the sage-kings took no notice of them; the noble person did not speak of them. They were absent in well-ordered ages. I fear that future rulers, wide-eyed and gaping, will fixate solely on such matters; and that their ministers, with cunning deceit and artful flattery, will curry favor with their lords, abandoning what they ought to govern while demanding results from Heaven. Should some strange vapor arise and anomalies multiply, should some sudden change appear—its hue, luster, form, and aspect beyond what ears and eyes can comprehend—then they will take it as an omen, and ruler and ministers will change countenance, scholars and commoners alter their bearing. They will compose hymns and offer them at the suburban altars, adorn with intricate embroidery and boast of it to their ministers and people, proudly declaring that no age will ever match theirs.

Yet when they look back to the ancients, what they call the feeding of creatures in pens, the diversion of streams, the cultivation of garden plots, the storage of chests and cases—all as clear as the sun and stars above—are now prized as rare and extraordinary, as if they were the rarest of fortunes, unattainable even in the most flourishing ages. How far they fall short of the measure of true kingship!

Zihua Zi dwelled in Ling. Beigong Yi and Gongzhong Cheng attended him, and in their free discourse, they spoke of medicine. Zihua Zi said: Medicine is *li* (principle). *Li* is *yi* (intention). Remedies are *lun* (permeation). *Lun* is *yang* (nourishment). The latent depths of the viscera, the stagnation of blood and qi, the blockages of hollows and cavities, the obstructions of the diaphragm—anticipate what has not yet arisen, foresee what is about to come. Discern the four conditions, and carefully apply *li*—this is what it means to be a physician.

Use what is in surplus to nourish what is lacking; use what is abundant to restore what is depleted. Reverse the nourishment, and what is abundant will grow more depleted; reverse the nourishment, and what is in surplus will grow more deficient. Discern these two reversals, and administer *lun* accordingly—this is what it means to prescribe remedies. Thus it is said: Medicine is *li*. *Li* is *yi*. Remedies are *lun*. *Lun* is *yang*.

Beigong Yi said: Precisely so—yet this is beyond the capacity of common physicians. Though I have heard that to rely on *yi* is inferior to the healing of *wu-yi* (non-intention); to depend on *yang* is inferior to the efficacy of *wu-dai* (non-reliance). May I ask: Man possesses spirit—its ascent and descent, its rising and falling, flow in accord with day and night, intermingling with Heaven and Earth. How many kinds of this essence exist?

Zihua Zi said: Ah, what an excellent question! Extend it by analogy, and you will advance to consult with those who know the Dao. I have arranged what I have studied and selected from it. When Heaven bestows the primal qi, the five qi follow, lodging within yin and yang, combining to form the body. Thus there is Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Yin, and Lesser Yin. Within yin there is yang; within yang there is yin. Thus, yang within yang is fire; yin within yin is water; yin within yang is wood; yang within yin is metal. Earth resides between the two qi, governing the four directions—yin when among yin, yang when among yang. Thus, things cannot form without earth, and man cannot live without earth.

The north, where yin reaches its extreme, generates cold, and cold generates water. The south, where yang reaches its extreme, generates heat, and heat generates fire. The east, where yang stirs and disperses, generates wind, and wind generates wood. The west, where yin halts and gathers, generates dryness, and dryness generates metal. The center, where yin and yang intersect, generates dampness, and dampness generates earth. Thus, within the heavens and earth, within the six directions, nothing departs from the five. Man is the same: when blood and qi harmonize, when constructive and defensive energies flow smoothly, when the five viscera are complete, when spirit resides in the heart, when the ethereal and corporeal souls are fully possessed—only then is a person whole.

Thus, the five viscera and six bowels each have their governing spirit. Essence is endowed by metal and fire; qi harmonizes with water and wood. The union of essence and qi gives rise to ten entities: essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, heart, intention, will, thought, wisdom, and deliberation. That from which life arises is called essence; the interaction of two essences is called spirit; that which follows spirit in its going and returning is called ethereal soul; that which accompanies essence in its exit and entry is called corporeal soul; that which engages with things is called heart; what the heart recalls is called intention; what intention preserves is called will; what will accomplishes is called thought; thought that yearns and longs is called deliberation; deliberation that resolves and releases is called wisdom.

Among the ten faculties, wisdom stands supreme. When one attains wisdom, one knows how to maintain; knowing how to maintain, one knows how to nurture. The circulation of *ying* and *wei* qi proceeds without losing its regularity; the six fu organs transform grain, and fluids distribute yang. Thus one may endure long without decay.

Flowing water does not stagnate because it moves; the hinge of a door does not rot because it turns. Therefore, when essence ascends excessively, it congeals; when spirit is dull, it lies dormant; when the ethereal soul is constrained, it sinks; when the corporeal soul scatters, it dissipates; when the heart is entangled, it becomes confused; when will is pent-up, it falls into depression; when intention is restless, it loses direction; when thought is obstructed, it falters; when deliberation is exhausted, it grows dim; when wisdom is hindered, it turns to folly.

Thus, what is called "maintaining" refers to maintaining these; what is called "nurturing" refers to nurturing these.

"How excellent is this insight!" one remarks. "By extension, advancing further in this leads to consulting those who embody the Dao."

Master Gongzhong said: "Your words, Master, and this inquiry—what I have received is what I have never heard before, as if a veil has been lifted. I hope you will expand upon your explanation and examine the principles underlying its resolution."

Master Zihua replied: "Indeed. Words cannot be exhausted in a single utterance. The heart is the ruler of the five viscera and the abode of spirit and essence. The essence of the heart is fire; its qi is *li*; its color is red; its form resembles an inverted lotus; its spirit is the Vermilion Bird; its orifice connects upward to the tongue.

The essence of the liver is wood; its qi is *zhen*; its color is green; its form resembles a suspended gourd; its spirit is the Azure Dragon; its orifice connects upward to the eyes.

The essence of the lungs is metal; its qi is *dui*; its color is white; its form resembles a suspended chime; its spirit is the Crouching Tiger; its orifice connects upward to the nose.

The essence of the kidneys is water; its qi is *kan*; its color is black; its form resembles a clamshell; its spirit is the Dark Turtle; its orifice connects upward to the ears.

The essence of the spleen is earth; its qi is *wu-ji*; its color is yellow; its form resembles an inverted jar; its spirit is the Phoenix; its orifice connects upward to the mouth.

Thus, the spleen, kidneys, heart, liver, and lungs govern the five officials; the mouth, tongue, nose, ears, and eyes serve as their messengers. The spleen stores intention; the kidneys store essence; the heart stores spirit; the liver stores the ethereal soul; the lungs store the corporeal soul.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are the summation of the five essences; cold, heat, wind, dryness, and dampness are the gathering of the five qi. Water moistens; fire warms; earth saturates; wood spreads; metal restrains—this is spoken in terms of their nature.

Water is cold; fire is scorching; earth is steamy; wood is warm; metal is clear—this is spoken in terms of their qi.

Water is below; fire is above; earth is in the center; wood is on the left; metal is on the right—this is spoken in terms of their positions.

Water is level; fire is sharp; earth is round; wood is curved and straight; metal is square—this is spoken in terms of their forms.

Water adapts; fire transforms; earth transmutes; wood changes; metal follows transformation—this is spoken in terms of their material.

Water pertains to wells and ditches; fire to cooking and cooling; wood and metal to implements; earth to planting and harvesting—this is spoken in terms of their functions.

That which fills heaven and earth and permeates all things is none other than these five. The presence of all five cannot be lacking; what they lack cannot be present. The subtle is nurtured to become manifest; the weak is nurtured to become strong; the diminished is nurtured to increase; the insufficient is nurtured to become abundant. Nothing is not nurtured; nothing is not complete—this is called harmony.

Joy, anger, sorrow, and fear—thought cannot disturb them; seeing, hearing, speaking, and appearance—thought cannot seize them. This is called the state of great harmony, which does not rely on intention to serve as medicine. In the customs of great harmony, there is no need for nurturing to serve as remedy. One does not allow things to disrupt harmony, nor desires to confuse the emotions.

When the center is unburdened, the Dao gathers in emptiness; when the heart is unencumbered, the Dao rests in equilibrium. Peaceful, calm, and joyful, one exhales the old and inhales the new. At rest, one closes with yin; in motion, one opens with yang. Those who attain this proceed from humanity to heaven, uniting with the three qi of the Great Beginning.

There is no better method than this for rectifying the heart, cultivating the self, governing the state, and ordering the world. My explanation is complete here."

The two disciples bowed and withdrew, recording these words to remember them. *Zihua zi*, Scroll Nine ends.

The Spirit and Qi

*Zihua zi* said: The perfected ones of antiquity probed the subtle and delved into the profound, their hearts in communion with heaven. With clarity and luminosity embodied, they shared in the works of the Divine Sovereign. Thus, when they advanced to positions above, the resonance of their utmost essence flowed unimpeded. Ascending, they reached the floating realms; descending, they plumbed the depths of care; extending laterally, they filled the four directions. Without speech, they guided transformation; without summons, they elicited response—for what moved them arose from within.

In the eras of Fuxi and Shennong, the people were simple and unformed, stumbling in darkness, knowing not why things were as they were, yet so they were—thus did they attain long years. In the ages of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, the people were unadorned yet upright, steadfast and flourishing, neither base nor prematurely cut down—thus did they resist aging.

The customs of later ages were not so. They wearied of ornate rhetoric yet achieved no substance; their cunning deceived one another, yet their true feelings found no echo. Like those who mend their fur coats only after the frost and snow warn them, or tend their stoves only when the cold has already set in—mechanisms lie hidden within, yet the multitude harbors deceitful hearts, and so they assail one another from without. Thus fathers weep for their sons, elder brothers mourn their younger siblings. Discord and contention arise, a hundred ailments flourish, pestilence spreads in its season, the Way bears the burden of the young and infirm, the blind, the bald, the mad, the hunchbacked—ten thousand anomalies take form. The cause of this lies in the resonance of qi.

How subtle are the movements of spirit and qi! The sun and moon suffer eclipse, rainbows appear by day, the five planets encroach upon one another, the four seasons transgress their bounds, rivers run dry, mountains collapse, night’s light invades the day, stones speak, dogs fall ill, summer brings frost, winter brings thunder—twisted omens and all manner of calamities arrive unbidden and converge. The cause of this lies in the configurations of qi.

How subtle are the movements of spirit and qi! Thus it is said: Heaven and humankind share a means of communion. This is what is meant.

After twelve years of following Master Zihua in his travels, our eyes met often but our words seldom did. When my studies were complete, I took leave to return home, intending to retire to the valley of the Five Springs. Master Zihua said: "Among all things under heaven, there are those so slippery and hard to grasp—do you understand this? Seize them too hastily, and they slip away; move too slowly, and they dissolve and vanish. This is not what is meant by 'holding fast to the round.' The true master of holding fast knows how to act in the space between haste and delay. In what you have studied, I find no fault. Yet your ambitions are broad and indiscriminate in their reach. I fear that later, you will become one who chooses, and there will be those who plunder your outer defenses to build their own palaces, who mount your chariot and ride it racing through the outskirts, who take what you have shaped into jade and shatter it to divide the pieces.

The Dao inherently abhors not being transmitted, for without transmission, it is obstructed. Yet it also abhors not finding the proper means of transmission, for without the proper means, it is harmed. Now you depart, and if you reflect carefully on how to be prudent in your giving, then I will have no fault to find in you."

The sow of the Ziche family was of pure black hue. In one litter, she bore three piglets: two were pure black like herself, but one was mottled with white. Displeased that it did not resemble her, she gnawed and bit it to death, tearing open its belly and intestines until nothing remained. Yet the piglets that were like her, she nursed with the utmost care, fearful they might come to harm. Master Zihua said: "How profoundly the workings of the mind can shift! The eye is dazzled by differences, and the heart is stirred by love and hate. Even her own offspring she kills without remorse—how much more so those not of her kind?

Nowadays, people in their daily lives clasp hands, whisper in each other’s ears, make promises to secure their bonds, more inseparable than glue or lacquer. Yet at the first brush with power or profit, with not even the slightest divergence, their countenance changes in an instant, and they follow with armed force. How profoundly the workings of the mind can shift! They are no different from the sow of the Ziche family."

In Song there was a man named Chengzi who lost his black robe. He searched for it along the road and saw a woman wearing a black robe. He seized her and would not let go, saying: "You must repay me with this." The woman said: "Though you have lost a black robe, this is one I made for myself." Chengzi said: "You had better repay me quickly. The one I lost was a lined black robe, while yours is a single-layered one. If you give me a single-layered robe in place of a lined one, how can I not get what I want?" Master Zihua said: "When profit muddles the mind, one is fortunate merely to gain something, forgetting the very nature of what was sought. Fortunate in gaining yet forgetting the nature of what was sought—what would such a person not dare to do? Among people today, those who do not act like Chengzi are few indeed."

Master Zihua said: "Are the scholars of this age not fortunate? Rivers become rivers by the gathering of waters; ages become ages by the gathering of people. Below the Dragon Gate, the Yellow River rushes like an arrow loosed from the bow. How long is a human life, that one should wait for opportunities? In the ancient age of good governance, one accumulated virtue in oneself as naturally as skin and flesh fill out, ever fearful of not cultivating it further, never anxious over being unknown. Like striking a drum or bell, one’s influence spread in all four directions, resonant and far-reaching.

But now it is not so. The lone tree that stands tall amid the howling storm is the first to fall; the red grasses wither at the first touch of frost and dew. The denizens of the marketplace then slander and defame, shaving heads and shaking chains. Thus, the slightest intention in the heart, not yet formed in the slightest degree, triggers hidden snares. One extends one’s limbs, not yet having assumed a posture, yet already stumbling into stocks and pillories. Clinging to a single, unyielding principle, one remains silent and obscure, wishing to put it to the test—but the long night stretches on, and dawn has not yet come. Thunder splits the mountains, torrential rain falls without end, and the rooster, blinded in its coop, forgets its duty to herald the dawn. How long is a human life, that one should wait for opportunities? Are the scholars of this age not fortunate?"

Master Liuzi built his dwelling by the valley of the Five Springs and sent his disciple, Prince Bin Xushu, to see Master Zihua in Qi. He said: "My master has charged me to present this respectful request. The valley of the Five Springs is the most secluded place in the world, where squirrels wail and weasels cry, where dawn and dusk blur into one, and all around, one looks in vain for the sound of human voices. Yet though the soil is rich and fertile, its plants grow lush and moist. Its clear streams flow in all four directions, never lacking for irrigation. Its water plants and grasses suffice for offerings. Light and shadow race across the paths, retreating into the depths of ravines and gorges, where clouds and rain emerge and vanish. Its rocks are jagged and rough, glowing like crimson clouds. The fragrance of flowers and grasses is carried on the wind. Plowing the fields and drinking from the stream, one’s labor is light, and one may pass the years in leisure, whistling and singing.

Now, Master, your years advance, and what you have stored within has no limit. Yet the lands between the Fen and Yellow Rivers do not welcome you, and you take refuge by the sea, where the harvest has failed. How will you sustain yourself? Among the lords of today, their lands are evenly matched, and their virtue is much the same. Whose court will recognize the worth of your carriage? Thus, Master Liuzi has sent me to present this respectful request: Would you not rather grace the mountain streams with your presence, so that the people here may hear with their ears and see with their eyes? Does the Master have no inclination toward this?"

Master Zihua said: "Return and tell your master that what he has entrusted to me weighs heavily upon my mind, like a cauldron set over a blazing fire."

I have heard this: the highest withdraw from the world, the next withdraw from their land, and the next withdraw from others. What I aspire to is but to withdraw from my land. Long ago, I spoke these parting words at our gathering: "When I die, carry my bones back across the river to join my ancestors beneath the Ling Barrier." My intent is already fixed—it cannot follow your request.

Where the will resides, though distant it feels near, though incomplete it achieves completion; though lands be torn asunder and earth split apart, nothing can come between me and it. From this moment on, my spirit shall roam freely among the Five Springs, and day and night, it shall attend only to me. Why must I go anywhere?

Ah, come here, Binxu. My inability to go is like your master’s inability to come. As the *Odes* says: *"No going, no coming—it pains my heart."* You and your master—we shall not meet again.

Master Zihua returned from Qi and summoned Zihui, instructing him: "Come, Hui, you young one—heed my words carefully. Long ago, our ancestral lord served the Zhou as *Ri Zheng*. When the Duke of Zhou acted, establishing the capital at Chengzhou and casting the tripods at Jiaru, he harmonized the Zhou suburbs, and our ancestral lord offered what he deemed auspicious. His clan had three treasures: the uncut jade of Jingli, the ceremonial chariot of Mount Tai, and the extraordinary grain of Tang Shu.

When Tang Shu obtained the grain—stalks from different fields bearing identical ears—our ancestral lord requested to present it as tribute. The king commanded the division of treasures with the Duke of Lu, and at that time, Yong Zhan personally returned the grain to the Duke of Zhou, composing the *Returning Grain*. The Duke of Zhou, by the Son of Heaven’s decree, composed the *Auspicious Grain*. Thus, our ancestral lord first had the *Pu Bi* jade for court audiences, compiled the *Cheng Dian*, and recorded his meritorious deeds, the records of which remain in the old archives.

By King Xuan’s reign, our ancestral lord entered the Six Armies as the king’s tiger-like minister, known as the *Sima*. After nine generations of *Sima* descendants, some scattered to dwell between the Fen and Yellow Rivers. Eleven generations later, the state was absorbed into Wen.

When the late Grand Master, King Xuan, passed, he turned his back on his kin, yet our ancestral lord rendered great service to the Zhao lineage, flourishing like melon vines. Thus, I have sheltered in their glory and partaken of their fruits. Though in my own time I did not serve Duke Jian, the Zhao are truly the clan my surname reveres.

Now, our lord is strong-willed and capable in governance, enduring disgrace without hidden faults, striking forthrightly without deviation. Moreover, he accepts others’ admonitions—he will surely illuminate the Zhao house’s legacy and expand upon his predecessors’ achievements. I am old now and cannot assist in its fulfillment.

Come, Hui, you young one—heed my words carefully. Do not harbor divided loyalties in serving our lord. As for the burial rites I owe my ancestors, follow neither excess nor frugality, but strike the proper balance. Do not let the filth of世俗 obscure what I have cultivated.

As for your own aspirations, Hui, strive to be like the millet of our ancestral lord—then even in my absence, your name will endure without end.

Come, Hui, you young one—heed my words carefully."
