**Preface to the *Explication of the Grand Brilliance of Huainan***

The Prince of Huainan was named An, eldest son of Prince Li. Prince Li was the son of Emperor Gao. His mother was a woman of the Zhao clan, a beauty in the service of King Zhang Ao of Zhao. In the seventh year of Emperor Gao’s reign, he pursued Han Xin to Tongdi, whereupon Han Xin fled to the Xiongnu. The emperor then marched north to Loufan and, on his return, passed through Zhao but treated King Zhao with discourtesy. The king offered him a beautiful woman. The Zhao woman, having found favor and conceived a child, was not dared to be housed within the palace; instead, a residence was built for her outside. When the plot of Guan Gao and others was uncovered, the king was arrested and tried, and his entire household—including the beauty—was seized. The officials reported to the emperor that the Zhao woman had found favor and was with child, but the emperor, still enraged at King Zhao, took no action. The beauty’s younger brother, Jian, through Shen Yiji, the Marquis of Piyang, relayed the matter to Empress Lü, but she refused to intercede, nor did the marquis press the issue. When the Zhao beauty bore a son, she grew distressed and took her own life. The officials presented the boy to the emperor, who commanded Empress Lü to raise him and enfeoffed him as Prince of Huainan.

When Emperor Wen ascended the throne, the prince’s younger brother submitted a memorial requesting an audience. The emperor summoned him to Chang’an, where they daily indulged in feasting and revelry, behaving as familiarly as brothers. The prince resented the Marquis of Piyang for failing to plead his mother’s case before Empress Lü and bludgeoned him to death. The emperor reproached him. The prince stripped to the waist and prostrated himself at the northern steps of the palace to beg forgiveness, whereupon the emperor stripped him of four counties and sent him home. Returning to his fief, he had a yellow canopy and left-plumed banner made, styling himself the "Eastern Emperor." For this, he was exiled to Yandao in Shu, where he died at Yong. The emperor, moved by pity, enfeoffed his four sons as marquises. At the time, the people composed a song about him:

*A foot of silk, so fine and bright;
A pint of grain, so full and light.*

The two brothers could not tolerate one another. When the emperor heard of this, he said, "Do I covet their lands?" He then summoned the four sons and enfeoffed them. One fell ill and died; the eldest, An, succeeded as King of Huainan; the next became King of Hengshan; and the next, King of Lujiang. The Grand Tutor Jia Yi admonished, "Those who harbor resentment must not be ennobled." Later, Huainan and Hengshan indeed rebelled, just as Jia Yi had warned.

Earlier, An was eloquent and well-versed in composition. As the emperor’s cousin, he frequently submitted memorials and was summoned for audiences. Emperor Xiaowen held him in high regard and once instructed him to compose a *fu* in the style of the *Li Sao*. An received the imperial command at dawn and completed it by breakfast. The emperor cherished it and kept it secret. Scholars of esoteric arts from across the realm flocked to him. Thereupon, he gathered eight men—Su Fei, Li Shang, Zuo Wu, Tian You, Lei Bei, Mao Bei, Wu Bei, and Jin Chang—along with disciples of the Ru scholars Da Shan and Xiao Shan, to collectively discourse on the Dao and virtue, synthesize benevolence and righteousness, and compile this work. Its purport aligns closely with Laozi, advocating tranquility and non-action, treading the void and embracing stillness, entering and exiting the classics and the Dao.

In its grandeur, it encompasses heaven and earth; in its subtlety, it delves into the boundless. It addresses the rise and fall of ancient and modern states, the vicissitudes of survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, and the strange and wondrous phenomena of the world. Its meanings are profound, its prose abundant, and it catalogs all things by their kind, leaving nothing unrecorded. Yet its overarching theme returns to the Dao. It is titled *Honglie*—*Hong* meaning "great," and *Lie*, "illumination"—for it is a work that greatly illuminates the words of the Dao. Thus, scholars who do not study *Huainanzi* cannot fathom the depth of the great Dao. For this reason, past worthies and erudite Ru have all drawn from it to verify the classics and traditions. Due to his father’s taboo name *Chang*, all instances of *chang* in his writings were altered to *xiu*.

The Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, Liu Xiang, collated and edited the text, naming it *Huainan*. There were also nineteen additional chapters, known as the *Outer Chapters of Huainan*.

From his youth, Liu An was instructed in punctuation and recitation of the text’s main ideas by Lu Jun, a former Palace Attendant from the same county. Later, amid the chaos of war and the fracturing of the realm, the books and transmissions were lost, and the study of *Huainanzi* lay abandoned for over twenty years. In the tenth year of Jian’an, he was appointed Attendant Gentleman to the Minister of Works and later became Magistrate of Puyang in Dongjun. Observing that few in his time studied *Huainanzi*, he feared its gradual decline. Thus, in the intervals between morning and evening court duties, he deeply pondered his former teacher’s instructions, cross-referenced them with the classics and Daoist writings, and compared its contents to compose annotations, preserving the original text in full while adding phonetic glosses.

The Colonel-Director of the Imperial Farmers, Bian Yi, borrowed eight chapters to transcribe them, but upon Bian Yi’s death, they were lost and could not be recovered. In the seventeenth year, upon his transfer to oversee Hedong, he once again supplemented and completed the work. His learning was shallow and his knowledge limited; he could not fully grasp all that eluded him, nor annotate what he had not heard.

May the erudite gentleman peruse and examine this in detail, that it may encourage later scholars.

**“The Original Dao” (Part One)**

*Original* means “root.” The root of the Dao is the primal truth, enveloping heaven and earth, unfolding through the myriad things—hence it is called the *Original Dao*. Thus the chapter is so titled.

The Dao covers heaven and bears earth—it is formless yet vast. It extends to the four directions and opens the eight limits. *Extends* means “to stretch.” *Opens* means “to unfold.” The *eight limits* are the farthest reaches of the eight directions, denoting its boundlessness. *Opens* is pronounced like the watchman’s clapper in “beating the watch at the double gates.”

It is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. *Reach* means “to attain.” *Measure* denotes depth; another reading takes it as “exhaustion.” It envelops heaven and earth, bestowing and imparting the formless. *Bestowing* means “to provide.” *Imparting* means “to grant.” The *formless* refers to the state before the myriad things take shape. All things arise from the Dao—hence it is said to “bestow and impart the formless.”

Its source flows like a spring, surging and slowly filling; turbid yet gradually clarifying. *Source* is where the spring first emerges. *Surging* means “welling up.” *Empty* means “void.” At its inception, it is void, then flows ceaselessly until it fills all—this is an analogy for the Dao. *Turbid* is pronounced like *bone*.

Thus, when planted, it fills heaven and earth; when laid horizontally, it pervades the four seas. Its application is inexhaustible, without morning or evening. *Planted* means “erected.” *Fills* means “to saturate.” *Pervades* means “to interweave.” *Application* means “use.” Its use is never exhausted, without rise or decline in the morning or evening.

When unfurled, it covers the six directions; when rolled up, it does not fill a single grasp. *Unfurled* means “spread out.” *Covers* means “to overspread.” The first month of spring and the first month of autumn form one pair; the second month of spring and the second month of autumn form another; the third month of spring and the third month of autumn form a third; the first month of summer and the first month of winter form a fourth; the second month of summer and the second month of winter form a fifth; the third month of summer and the third month of winter form the sixth—hence the *six directions*. This means it fills all between heaven and earth. Another interpretation takes the *six directions* as the four directions plus above and below. *Does not fill a single grasp* signifies its profound subtlety.

It contracts yet can expand, is obscure yet can illuminate—this speaks of the Dao’s capacity to be small or vast, faint or bright. It is weak yet can be strong, soft yet can be firm. Such is the nature of the Dao.

It spans the four corners and embraces yin and yang. *Spans* is pronounced like the *guang* in *guangche* (a type of chariot). It governs the cosmos and manifests the three luminaries. *Governs* means “to regulate,” like the ribs of a small carriage canopy, which are called *strings*—akin to cords. The *four directions plus above and below* are called *yu*; *past and present* are called *zhou*—these denote heaven and earth. *Manifests* means “to make clear.” The *three luminaries* are the sun, moon, and stars.

It is most thick and viscous, most fine and subtle. *Viscous* also means “deep.” The sediment in congee is called *viscous*. *Viscous* is pronounced like the *ge* in *ge’ou* (singing).

By it, mountains are high, abysses are deep; beasts run, birds fly; the sun and moon shine, the stellar paths move; the qilin roams, the phoenix soars. *By it* means “through its use.” *Roams* means “emerges.” *Soars* describes great flight without movement.

In the grand antiquity of the Two Sovereigns, they grasped the handle of the Dao, dwelling at the center. The *Two Sovereigns* were Fuxi and Shennong. They pointed to and expounded yin and yang—hence they are not called the Three. The spirits wandered with transformation, pacifying the four directions. *Pacifying* means “to settle.” The *four directions* are called *tianxia* (the world).

Thus, they could set heaven in motion and earth at rest, turning the wheel without cessation. *Motion* means “to move.” *Rest* means “to halt.” *Cessation* means “to pause.” Water flows without ceasing, accompanying the myriad things from beginning to end. Wind and clouds arise, and all affairs respond accordingly. *Respond* means “to correspond.” Thunder rumbles, rain falls—all respond without end. *End* means “to conclude.”

Spirits emerge, lightning enters; dragons rise, phoenixes gather. *Spirits emerge* means “without trace.” *Lightning enters* means “its swiftness is obscure.” The potter’s wheel turns, the hub revolves, circling and returning to its origin. *Wheel* refers to the rotating mechanism of the potter’s tool for making vessels. Another interpretation takes it as *heaven*. Carved and polished, it returns to simplicity.

Acting without action, it accords with the Dao; speaking without speech, it penetrates virtue. This describes the transformation of the Three through non-action, and thus their words align with the Dao. Without speaking, they naturally attain virtue. Serene and joyful, without arrogance, they achieve harmony. *Serene* means “without preferences or aversions.” *Without arrogance* means “not self-aggrandizing.” Though the myriad things differ, they are all suited to their natures. Though affairs vary, they are fitting for their natures—nature does not desire excess.

The spirit lodges at the tip of an autumn hair, yet encompasses the totality of the cosmos. *Cosmos* refers to the entirety of heaven and earth. Its virtue surpasses heaven and earth, harmonizing yin and yang. *Surpasses* means “to be gentle.” *Harmonizing* means “to regulate.” It orders the four seasons and regulates the five phases. The *five phases* are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

It nurtures and shelters, fostering the multitude of beings. *Nurtures* means “to warm and comfort.” *Fosters* means “to cultivate.” It moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone. Beasts grow large, their fur lustrous; wings and feathers flourish. *Flourish* means “vigorous.” Antlers and horns grow. *Antlers* are deer antlers; *horns* are elk antlers. *Horns* is pronounced like *ge*.

Animal fetuses do not miscarry, bird eggs do not spoil. *Miscarry* means a fetus that does not become a beast; *spoil* means an egg that does not hatch—a double negative to affirm their completion. Fathers do not grieve for lost sons, elder brothers do not mourn younger brothers. This speaks of the absence of premature death. Children are not orphaned, women are not widowed. *Orphaned* means fatherless; *widowed* means a woman without a husband. Rainbows do not appear, baleful stars do not move. *Baleful stars* are ominous stars. This is the result of embracing virtue. *Embracing* means “to hold within.”

The Supreme Dao of the Great Above
gives life to the myriad things yet does not possess them—
it does not regard them as its own.
It completes transformations and forms yet does not govern.
*Govern* means “to control.”

Those that walk on limbs or breathe through beaks,
those that fly in spirals or creep and crawl,
all await it before coming to life,
yet none know its virtue—
it does not rely on virtue for this.
They await it before dying,
yet none can resent it—
it does not oppress through cruelty.

Those who gain benefit cannot praise it;
those who use it and fail cannot blame it.
It gathers and stores yet does not grow richer—
*Gathering and storing* refers to the state’s regular taxes.
*Does not grow richer* means it does not treat them as its own.
It distributes and bestows yet does not grow poorer—
*Distributing and bestowing* means aiding the destitute and supplying the needy.
Since it uses the resources of the public, it does not grow poorer.

It is so vast it cannot be fathomed,
so subtle it cannot be exhausted.
*Vast* means “small”;
*exhausted* means “fully known.”
Pile it up and it does not rise higher;
cast it down and it does not sink lower.
Augment it and it does not increase;
diminish it and it does not decrease.
Carve it and it does not grow thinner;
cut it and it does not become damaged.
Hollow it and it does not grow deeper;
fill it and it does not grow shallower.

Swift yet serene,
it cannot be depicted—
serene yet swift,
its use is inexhaustible.
*Swift* and *serene* describe its lack of form.
Thus it is said it cannot be depicted.
*Inexhaustible* means “depleted.”
*Serene* is pronounced like *huǎng* in “empty”;
*inexhaustible* is pronounced like *qū* in “tailless quail.”

Obscure yet dark,
it responds without form—
profound yet boundless,
it does not act in vain.

Deep—it means "penetrating."
The Dao moves and has its responses,
thus it is said it does not act in vain.

It harmonizes with hardness and softness, coiling and unfurling;
it moves with yin and yang, rising and falling.
*Coiling and unfurling* mean bending and extending;
*rising and falling* mean ascending and descending.

Long ago, Feng Yi and Tai Bing were its charioteers—
*Yi* may also be written as *Chi*;
*Bing* may also be written as *Bo*—
both were ancients who attained the Dao and could harness yin and yang.
They rode cloud chariots, entered cloud banners,
and roamed through subtle mists,
using cloud-shedding as their steeds.
*Roamed* means "traveled";
*subtle mists* are the faint qi of heaven.
Swift and boundless, they traversed distant heights to the farthest reaches.
*Swift* means "to gallop";
*boundless* is the image of nothingness;
*reaches* means "journey."

They passed through frost and snow without leaving tracks,
and when illuminated by sunlight, cast no shadow.
They ascended in spiraling winds, embracing the ram’s horns,
*Embracing* means "to coil tightly."
*Spiraling winds* twist like coiled horns, rising in their turning.
*Embracing* is read like *yí* in "distinct and towering."
They traversed mountains and rivers, scaled the Kunlun peaks,
pushed open the celestial gates, and entered the Gate of Heaven.
*Traversed* means "to pass through";
*ordered* means "to connect";
*scaled* means "to tread";
*ascended* means "to rise."
Kunlun is a mountain in the northwest,
standing one hundred ninety thousand *li* high,
the source of the Yellow River.
*Pushed open* means "to thrust aside";
*entered* means "to pass into."
*Changhe* is the gate through which one first ascends to heaven;
*Gate of Heaven* is where the Supreme Lord dwells,
the gate of the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Such were the powers of Feng Yi and Tai Bing as charioteers.

In later ages, charioteers,
though they possess light carriages and fine horses,
sturdy whips and sharp bits,
cannot rival them in speed.
*Sturdy* means "strong";
*whips* are goads.
*Cannot rival* means they cannot surpass Feng Yi and Tai Bing in swiftness.
*Bits* is read like *bǐng* in "bright candle."

Thus the great man, tranquil and thoughtless,
serene and carefree,
takes heaven as his canopy,
earth as his chariot,
the four seasons as his horses,
and yin and yang as his charioteers.
He rides the clouds and ascends the heavens,
keeping company with the Creator.
*The great man* is one who embodies the Dao;
*Creator* is another name for the Dao.
*Heavens* is read like *xiāo* in "ebb and flow."

He lets his will roam and his joints relax,
galloping through the great expanse.
*Expanse* means "dwelling";
*dwelling* refers to heaven.
He may walk when he wishes to walk,
or gallop when he wishes to gallop.
He commands the Rain Master to sprinkle the path
and the Wind Earl to sweep away the dust.
*The Rain Master* is the Star of Net;
as the *Book of Songs* says: "When the moon passes through Net, it brings torrential rain."
*The Wind Earl* is the Star of Winnowing Basket;
when the moon lodges in Winnowing Basket, winds stir up the dust.

He uses lightning as his whip,
*Lightning* is surging qi—
thus he makes it his whip.
and thunder as his wheels,
*Thunder* is revolving qi—
thus he makes it his wheels.
Above, he roams the wilds of the empyrean;
below, he emerges from the gate of the boundless.
*Empyrean* describes towering heights;
*boundless* describes formlessness.
*Empyrean* is read like *xiāo* in "deep blue";
*boundless* is read like *dí* in "Zhai clan."

His gaze surveys all directions, then returns to preserve wholeness.
*Surveys* means "to look back";
*surveys* is read like *liú* in "lingering," not the *Liú* surname.
He manages the four corners, then returns to the pivot.
*Corners* mean "directions";
*pivot* means "root."
Thus when he takes heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered;
when he takes earth as his chariot, nothing is left unborne.
When he takes the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded;
when he takes yin and yang as his charioteers, nothing is left unprepared.
Yin and yang follow in sequence to complete the myriad things—
nothing is lacking.
Thus it is said nothing is left unprepared.

Therefore, though swift, he is not shaken;
though distant, he is not wearied.
His four limbs remain unmoved,
his hearing and vision undiminished—
*Diminished* means "reduced."
yet he knows the forms of the eight cords and nine wilds—
how so?
*The eight cords* are the eight directions of heaven;
*the nine wilds* are the eight directions and the center.

He grasps the handle of the Dao’s essentials
and roams the boundless lands.
Thus the affairs of the world cannot be forced—
*Forced* means "to act after."
One must follow their natural course and guide them.
*Guide* means "to seek" or "to lift."
The transformations of the myriad things cannot be fathomed—
one must hold fast to their essentials and return to their tendencies.
*Tendencies* also mean "return."

When mirror and water meet with forms,
they do not employ cleverness,
and thus square and round, crooked and straight cannot escape them.
*Cleverness* means "artful adornment."
Mirror and water do not apply artful adornment—
human forms, beautiful or ugly, are reflected as they truly are.
Thus it is said square and round, crooked and straight cannot escape them.

Therefore, echoes do not strain to respond,
and shadows do not contrive to appear—
shouts and calls come faintly,
yet all is silently self-contained.
*Self-contained* means it attains the state of shouts and calls faintly heard.

Humans are tranquil at birth—
this is the nature of heaven.
Stimulated, they then move—
this harms their nature.
When things arrive, the spirit responds—
this is the movement of knowledge.
*Things* mean "affairs."
When knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise.
*Engages* means "interacts";
*passions* mean "desires."
When likes and dislikes take form,
knowledge is lured by externals,
unable to return to the self,
and heavenly principle perishes.
*Takes form* means "becomes visible";
*lured* means "enticed."
Unable to return to the self’s originally endowed pure and tranquil nature,
it is said that heavenly principle perishes—
*perishes* means "declines."

Thus one who has attained the Dao
does not replace heaven with human affairs.
*Heaven* means "nature"—
he does not replace his heavenly nature with human affairs.
Another explanation: *heaven* means "the body"—
he does not replace his body with worldly desires and benefits.
Externally, he transforms with things,
yet internally does not lose his true nature.
This means that one who embodies the Dao,
though outwardly his appearance changes with things,
internally does not lose his fundamental nature of desirelessness.

He reaches nothingness yet fulfills all needs,
gallops with the times yet returns to the abode.

The seasons of heaven gallop forth on their own,
yet the Dao gathers them to their destined convergence.
Great and small, long and short—
each possesses its own completeness.
*Completeness* means "readiness."
All things arrive in tumultuous profusion,
yet none transgresses its measure.
*None transgresses its measure*—each responds to its proper limit.

Thus one who dwells above is not burdensome to the people,
and one who stands before is not harmful to the multitude.
This means the people revere and cherish him.
The world turns to him; the wicked and perverse fear him.
For he contends not with the myriad things,
and thus none dares contend with him.

Fishing by the river’s edge,
days may pass without filling even a basket.
Though one wields hooks sharp as thorns—
*thorns* means "claws" (here read as the barb of a hook)—
fine lines and fragrant bait,
and employs the techniques of Zhan He and Juan Xuan,
still one cannot rival the catch of nets and traps.
Zhan He and Juan Xuan were masters of the ancient art of angling.

The archer draws the bow of Wu Hao,
bends the arrows of Qi Wei—
*draws* means "to draw the bowstring,"
*bends* means "to draw to full tension."
*Qi* is the name of the place where fine arrows were produced;
*Wei* means "sharp."
Wu Hao refers to the mulberry and *zhe* trees, whose wood is firm and strong.
When crows perched upon their branches,
the branches would bend downward as the birds prepared to take flight,
yet the resilient wood would spring back,
causing the crows’ nests to sway.
The crows, too fearful to fly, would cry out in distress.
The branches were cut to make bows,
hence called the "Wu Hao bow."
Another explanation: When the Yellow Emperor cast his tripod at Mount Jing’s Dinghu Lake,
he attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal upon a dragon.
His ministers seized bows and shot at the dragon,
seeking to bring the Yellow Emperor down,
but their arrows missed.
*Wu* means "alas," *hao* means "to cry out"—
thus they embraced their bows and wailed,
and the bows were thereafter named "Wu Hao bows."

Even with the skill of Yi and his disciple Feng Meng,
one who aims to snare flying birds
still cannot rival the abundance caught by nets.
Yi was the lord of the state of Youqiong in ancient times;
Feng Meng was his disciple.
Both were archers who never missed their mark,
hence called "masters of skill."
*To aim* means "to pursue and compete."
Why is this so?
Because what they wield is too small.

If one were to spread a net across the entire world,
and cast it upon rivers and seas,
how could any fish or bird escape?
*Net* refers to fishing nets.
As the *Book of Songs* says: "The nets are cast with a rushing sound."

Thus arrows are not as effective as snares,
and snares are not as effective as formless influence.
This refers to the efficacy of arrows.
To abandon the great Dao and rely on petty techniques
is no different from using a crab to catch mice,
or a toad to seize fleas—
such methods cannot suppress treachery or block wickedness,
and disorder only grows more rampant.
When a crab is scorched with mugwort on its back
and placed in a mouse’s burrow,
the heat drives the mouse from its hole,
and the crab may seize it.
The toad—*chanchu*—
moves slowly and sluggishly,
and cannot catch all the fleas,
hence it is said to be insufficient to suppress treachery.
This analogy illustrates the severity of the Dao’s decline.

In ancient times, Gun built walls three *ren* high,
and the feudal lords turned against him;
even beyond the seas, cunning hearts arose.
Gun was the fifth-generation descendant of Emperor Zhuanxu and the father of Yu.
Eight *chi* make one *ren*.
Gun constructed city walls,
but the labor exhausted the people,
so the feudal lords rebelled.
Beyond the four seas, all harbored deceitful intentions.

Yu, knowing the world’s defiance,
tore down the walls, filled in the moats,
distributed wealth, burned armor and weapons,
and governed with virtue.
The lands beyond the seas submitted in allegiance,
and the four barbarians presented tribute.
*The four barbarians* refers to those beyond the seas;
*tribute* means "offerings."
He assembled the feudal lords at Mount Tu,
where ten thousand states bore jade and silk.
Mount Tu is located in Dangtu County, Jiujiang.
*Jade* refers to ceremonial tablets;
*silk* refers to dark and light red fabrics.

Thus when the heart of cunning and deceit lies hidden within the breast, purity remains unsullied no longer, and the power of spirit and virtue becomes incomplete. *Cunning and deceit* refers to artifice and guile. Concealed within the depths of the heart, the pure and unblemished Dao loses its perfection, and the virtue of undivided spirit cannot be whole. *Unsullied* is read as the "sui" in "misfortune and calamity."

What dwells within the self remains unknown—how then can what is distant be drawn near? *Drawn near* means "to come."

Therefore, when armor is hardened, weapons grow sharp; when walls are raised, siege engines arise. This speaks of how preparations for war give rise to conflict. It is like pouring boiling water on a fire—chaos only worsens.

To whip a snapping dog or spur a kicking horse, hoping to tame them—even Yi Yin or Zao Fu could not transform their nature. *Yi Yin*, named Zhi, was a worthy minister of Tang of Yin. *Zao Fu* was a servant of King Mu of Zhou, renowned for his charioteering. Yet even these two could not alter their nature.

When the heart of harm and malice vanishes from within, even a starving tiger may be grasped by the tail—how much more so dogs and horses? Thus one who embodies the Dao remains at ease and never exhausted, while one who relies on schemes toils without success.

Those who govern with harsh laws and cruel punishments do not build the enterprise of hegemons and kings; those who frequently resort to the whip and prod do not achieve far-reaching ends. *Frequently* means "repeatedly."

Li Zhu’s keen vision could discern the tip of a needle at a hundred paces—*Li Zhu* was a minister of the Yellow Emperor, a man of sharp eyesight—yet he could not see the fish in the depths of a pool. Shi Kuang’s acute hearing could harmonize the eight winds—*Shi Kuang* was the music master Ziye of Duke Ping of Jin; *the eight winds* refers to the winds of the eight trigrams—yet he could not hear what lay ten *li* away.

Thus relying on the ability of a single person is insufficient to govern even a three-*mu* estate. But if one cultivates the principles of the Dao and follows the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth, then the Six Directions are not too vast to bring into harmony. *Harmony* means "balance."

Therefore, when Yu dredged the waterways, he took the water itself as his teacher. When Shennong sowed the grains, he took the sprouts as his guide. *Yu*, son of Gun, was named Wenming. He received the jade baton and succeeded in his task, hence the name Yu. Following the nature of water, which flows downward, he dredged the rivers to flow eastward, setting an example for later generations. *Shennong*, son of Shaodian, was the Flame Emperor. He cultivated fine grains, transforming them through spiritual power, and was thus called Shennong. *Sowed* means "to scatter." He scattered the seeds of the hundred grains, nurturing their growth in accordance with their sprouting, establishing a constant teaching for later generations.

The duckweed takes root in water, *duckweed* being the great *ping*; trees take root in earth; birds soar through empty space; beasts tread upon solid ground—*tread* means "to step"; *solid* means "the earth." *Tread* is read as the "fu" in "to comfort and gather." Dragons dwell in water; tigers and leopards inhabit the mountains—this is the nature of Heaven and Earth. *Jiao* refers to the water dragon, whose skin bears pearls. In later times, this was used for the hilts of swords. *Jiao* is read as the "jiao" in "human nature and temperament," pronounced with a drawn-out breath.

When two pieces of wood are rubbed together, they ignite; when metal and fire are kept close, they melt—*melt* means "to flow." Wheels and spheres constantly turn; hollow things float—this is the natural tendency of things. *Wheels and spheres* refer to objects like wheels and pellets. *Hollow* means "empty," as in boats and ships. Thus it is said to be the natural tendency. *Hollow* is read as the "ke" in "sections and branches."

Therefore, when the spring wind arrives, sweet rain falls, nurturing the myriad things. *The Monthly Ordinances of the Hall of Light* states: "When the clear wind arrives, the Grain Rain follows." *Nurturing* means "to grow." *Wind* may also be written as *fenhe* (allotment and union).

Feathered creatures brood and hatch; furred creatures conceive and bear. *Brood* means "to warm and hatch eggs with qi." *Conceive* means "to carry offspring in the womb and give birth." The flourishing of plants and trees, the hatching of birds, the bearing of beasts—none see the one who acts, yet the work is already accomplished. *Already* means "complete."

When the autumn wind brings frost, the sprouting of life is checked and harmed. Plants and trees grow from the earth, hence "sprouting." *Checked and harmed* means "withered and fallen." Eagles and hawks strike with ferocity; insects and worms hide in hibernation—*ferocity* is read as the "shi" in "ten and five." Plants send their moisture to their roots; fish and turtles gather in the depths—none see the one who acts, yet all vanish without a trace. *Vanish* means "to disappear"; *trace* means "to appear."

Trees dwell in nests of brushwood—*brushwood* means "a thicket of trees"; water creatures live in caves and dens. Birds and beasts have their lairs—*lairs* means "bedding." Humans have their dwellings. On land, oxen and horses thrive; by water, boats travel far. The Xiongnu produce coarse furs—*Xiongnu* refers to the northern barbarians of Xianyun. The people of Yue weave fine kudzu cloth—*Yu* refers to Wu; *kudzu cloth* is fine kudzu fabric. Each produces what they urgently need to prepare for dryness and dampness. Each adapts to their environment to ward off cold and heat. All attain what is fitting, and things find their proper place.

From this, we observe that the myriad things are fundamentally natural—what then does the sage have to do? *Do* means "to govern."

South of the Nine Doubts, land-based work is scarce while water-based work abounds—*Nine Doubts* is a mountain name, located in Cangwu, where Yu Shun was buried. There, the people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies to resemble scaled creatures. *Cut* means "to shear"; *tattoo* means "to carve and paint their bodies, concealing the patterns within, forming the shapes of dragons and serpents so that when they enter the water, the dragons and serpents do not harm them." Thus it is said "to resemble scaled creatures."

They wear short sleeves and do not don trousers, to facilitate wading and swimming. They roll up their sleeves to make rowing easier—this is following the ways of water. *Roll up* means "to gather the sleeves"; *following* means "adapting to the suitability of water."

North of Yanmen, the Di do not eat grains, esteeming the strong and scorning the old, with customs that value strength. People do not unstring their bows; horses are not untethered—this is convenience. *Do not eat grains* means "they eat only meat and fermented milk." The northern Di are the Xianbei. *Unstring* means "to release"; *convenience* means "practice."

Thus when Yu entered the land of the naked, he removed his clothes to go in and put on his belt to come out—this was following their ways. *The land of the naked* lies in the south; the sage, in governing ritual, does not seek to change customs, hence "following their ways."

Now, when one transplants a tree and loses its balance of yin and yang, there is none that does not wither and die.

Losing it is akin to changing it. Thus, when the orange tree is planted north of the Jiang, it transforms into the zhi. The myna bird does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon-dog dies upon fording the Wen. As recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: "The myna bird came to nest." It speaks of a bird not native to the Central States—this was why it was deemed a sign of Duke Zhao of Lu’s virtue, an anomaly. Form and nature cannot be altered; position and dwelling cannot be shifted.

Therefore, those who attain the Dao return to clarity and stillness. *Return* means "to revert to the root." Heaven originally bestows upon man a nature of clarity and stillness, hence "return." Those who exhaust themselves in things end in non-action. *Non-action* means "not being acted upon by things." Nurturing one’s nature with tranquility and abiding the spirit in emptiness, one enters the Gate of Heaven. What is called *Heaven* is pure, unadulterated simplicity—upright, bright, and white—never yet mingled with anything impure. What is called *man* is entangled in cunning and deceit, crooked artifices and falsehoods, bowing and scraping before the world, engaging with common customs.

Thus, the ox has cloven hooves and bears horns; the horse is covered in mane and has whole hooves—this is Heaven. Bridling the horse’s mouth and piercing the ox’s nose—this is man. Those who follow Heaven wander with the Dao. *Follow* means "to comply"; *wander* means "to act." Those who follow man engage with common customs.

The well-dwelling fish cannot be spoken to of the great—it is confined by narrowness. The summer insect cannot be spoken to of cold—it speaks of the cicada that knows not winter’s snow. It is bound by its time. The narrow-minded scholar cannot be spoken to of the ultimate Dao—he is constrained by custom and fettered by doctrine.

Thus, the sage does not let human affairs disturb Heaven, nor desires disorder the emotions. *Heaven* refers to the body. He does not let human affairs disturb his body, nor desires disorder his emotions—this is the nature of the undefiled. Without plotting, he is fitting; without speaking, he is trusted; without deliberation, he attains; without acting, he accomplishes. The *Book of Songs* says: "Unknowing, unperceiving, he follows the pattern of the Lord." Thus it is said: without plotting, he is fitting; without deliberation, he attains.

With spirit penetrating the numinous palace, he becomes one who shapes creation. *Becomes* means "to govern." The good swimmer drowns; the good rider falls—each by their own fondness brings disaster upon themselves. *Disaster* means "harm." Thus, those fond of affairs are never without injury. *Injury* means "wounding." Those fond of indulging in emotions and desires never fail to wound themselves. Those who contend for profit never fail to reach exhaustion.

Of old, Gonggong’s strength struck Mount Buzhou, causing the earth to tilt southeast. Gonggong was one who wielded water to establish hegemony between Fuxi and Shennong—this was not the Gonggong of Yao’s time. Mount Buzhou lies northwest of Kunlun. *Tilt* means "to sink." The astronomical texts speak of Heaven tilting northwest and earth tilting southeast—first mentioning "tilt" to denote height. Later mentioning "southeast" clarifies its sinking. He contended with Gaoxin for the throne. Gaoxin was Emperor Ku, a title held over the realm. Ku was the great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor. Gonggong then submerged himself in the depths, his clan annihilated, his lineage and sacrifices cut off. This refers to Gonggong.

King Yi of Yue fled into a mountain cave, and the people of Yue smoked him out, leaving him no choice. *No choice* means "no recourse." Yi was the crown prince of Yue. Though virtuous and unwilling to be king, he fled into a mountain cave, but the people of Yue used fire to smoke him out and enthroned him. Thus it is said: "He had no choice but to return." This occurred after the *Spring and Autumn* period, hence it was not recorded in the classic.

From this, we see that attainment lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. *Governance* means "to act." Though sagacious, one cannot act without the Dao—thus it is said to lie in the Dao, as with Confucius.

Earth, dwelling below, does not contend for height—thus it is secure and not endangered. Water, flowing downward, does not contend for precedence—thus it is swift and not slow.

Of old, Shun tilled the fields of Mount Li. After a year, those who farmed vied to occupy the scorched and barren land, yielding the fertile and rich soil to one another. Mount Li lies in Chengyang of Jiyin. Another account places it in Licheng Mountain of Jinan. *Scorched and barren* is read as the hard and infertile land where people burn rafters.

He fished in the rivers and streams. After a year, those who fished vied to occupy the rapids and shallows, yielding the deep pools within winding banks to one another. *Fished* is read as conversing. *Rapids and shallows* are places where water is shallow and swift, with few fish. *Winding banks* are the curved shores where deep pools teem with fish. *Yielding* is read as in the *Book of Songs*: "The spreading vine."

At that time, he set no words with his mouth nor gestured with his hands. *Set no words* means he spoke no untrustworthy words; *gestured with no hands* means he did not presumptuously scheme or plan. Holding the profound virtue in his heart, his transformations spread like a spirit. *Profound* means Heaven; *spread* means "to act." *Like a spirit* means as if by divine transformation.

Had Shun lacked such resolve, though he spoke eloquently and expounded from door to door, he could not have transformed even one person. *Resolve* means the aspiration to rule all under Heaven. Another interpretation refers to the resolve of the human heart.

Thus, the Dao that cannot be spoken of is vast indeed. *Cannot be spoken of* means the Dao is ineffable, hence "the Dao that cannot be spoken of."

He who can govern the Sanmiao, bring the Feathered People to court—the Sanmiao were those exiled in Yao’s time, such as Hundun, Qiongqi, and Taotie. *Govern* means "to rule." The Feathered People were the inhabitants of the southern Feathered State. That they came to court was due to virtue drawing the distant near.

He who could follow the Land of the Naked and receive the Sushen without issuing commands or decrees yet altered customs and transformed manners—was this not solely the work of one whose conduct was rooted in the heart? The Land of the Naked lies in the south, where Yu entered. *Follow* means "to transform." The Sushen dwell in the distant north. The *Fu* says: "Sushen, Yan, and Bo are our northern lands." Only the transformative power of virtue can achieve this.

The imposition of laws and punishments—how could these suffice to achieve such ends? Words alone are insufficient to bring them about, making clear that nothing compares to the transformative power of a heart imbued with benevolence. Thus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without; he preserves his spirit, lays aside cunning and artifice, and abides in serene non-action—yet nothing remains undone. His capacity for non-action ensures that all things are transformed without resistance. In stillness, he governs nothing—yet nothing is left ungoverned.

What is called *non-action* is not acting before things arise. What is called *not acting* is following the natural course of things. It is to accord with the inherent nature of things. What is called *non-governance* is not altering what is natural. What is called *nothing left ungoverned* is following the mutual suitability of things. *Suitability* here means "what is fitting."

*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll One, concludes.
*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll Two, recorded by Minister of the Grand Commandant and Libationer Xu Shen.

**On Tracing the Dao, Part Two**

All things have their origins, yet only the wise preserve their roots.
*Roots* are the foundation.
All affairs arise from some source, yet only the wise guard their gates.
*Gates* are the crucial restraints.

Thus, to fathom the unfathomable, to reach the unreachable, to illumine things without confusion, to respond to echoes without exhaustion—this is called *heavenly release*.
*Confusion* means delusion.
*Heavenly release* is the release of Heaven’s intent.
It is to comprehend the will of Heaven.

Therefore, those who attain the Dao set their minds on weakness yet accomplish strength.
*Weakness* is softness.
*Strength* is invincibility.
Their hearts are empty yet their responses are fitting.
*Fitting* means harmonious.

What is called *setting the mind on weakness* is to be gentle, tranquil, and still, concealing oneself in non-daring, acting from non-ability, serene and without care, moving without missing the moment, revolving and turning with the myriad things, never taking the lead—only responding when moved.
*Moved* means stirred; *responding* means harmonizing.

Thus, the noble must take the lowly as their title.
*The noble* refers to dukes, kings, marquises, and earls, who style themselves "the solitary," "the widowed," or "the unworthy"—hence the saying, "taking the lowly as their title."
And the exalted must take the low as their foundation.
*Foundation* is the beginning.
For even the building of a towering terrace begins from the ground.

They entrust the small to encompass the great, reside within to govern without, act with softness yet are firm, employ weakness yet are strong. Through transformation and change, they grasp the Dao of unity and thereby rectify the many with the few.
*And* means "to be able."
To govern the many with the few.

What is called *accomplishing strength* is to meet sudden changes, respond to emergencies, dispel calamities, and resolve difficulties—no force is unconquerable, no enemy undefeated. Adapting to transformations and measuring the times, nothing can harm them.

Thus, those who desire firmness must hold to softness.
Those who desire strength must preserve weakness.
Accumulate softness, and firmness arises.
Accumulate weakness, and strength emerges.
Observe what they accumulate, and you will know the direction of fortune and misfortune.
*Direction* means "course."

Strength can overcome what is inferior to itself, but when it encounters its equal, it meets its match.
*Equal* means "the same."
Strength can overcome what is not its equal, but when it meets its equal, it cannot prevail.
This is why the smallness of strength is not valued by the Daoists.

Softness that overcomes what surpasses itself—its power is immeasurable.
For one who can be weak and soft yet overcome what is stronger, their power is beyond estimation.
Thus, the greatness of softness is what the Daoists value.

Therefore, when armies are strong, they perish.
Like fire, when strength blazes, it burns fiercely, and when it burns fiercely, it declines—hence the saying, "they perish."
This is the lesson of fire.
When wood is strong, it snaps—it cannot bend slowly.
When leather is rigid, it splits—like a drum.
*Perish* means "to be exhausted."
Though teeth are harder than the tongue, they wear out first.

Thus, softness and weakness are the stalks of life.
*Stalks* are the essence.
While firmness and strength are the followers of death.
*Followers* are the multitude.

Those who take the lead are on the path to exhaustion.
The first to act meet ruin—hence the saying, "exhaustion."
Those who act later do so with strategy—hence the saying, "attainment."

How do we know this is so?
The average person lives seventy years, yet in their pursuits and abandonments, their choices converge, and with each passing month, they feel regret—until death.
Thus, when Master Peng of Wey reached fifty, he recognized forty-nine years of error.
*Master Peng* was Qu Boyu, a grandee of Wey.
What he did this year was right, so he looked back and knew that what he did the previous year was wrong. Year after year, he felt regret—until death.
Thus, he had forty-nine years of error, which is what is meant by "monthly regret at the new moon, daily regret for yesterday."

Why is this?
The first to act are difficult to understand, while those who follow are easy to overcome.

Those who take the lead ascend to heights, and followers climb after them; those who lead descend into low places, and followers trip them; those who lead collapse and fall, and followers scheme against them; those who lead suffer defeat, and followers oppose them.

*Cù* means "to tread." Its pronunciation is *zhǎn*, not *zhǎn*. The people of Chu read *zhì* as *tuí*. *Tuí* refers to the carriage’s crossbar. Some say it is the *zhì* in *bázhì* ("stumbling"). From this, we see that those who lead become the target for those who follow—the *zhìdì*, the standard and aim of the archer. The *zhìdì* is what the archer takes as his mark.

It is like the blade and the butt of a spear: the blade faces danger, while the butt remains unharmed. Why? Because it relies on its position behind. *Chún* refers to the butt of a spear or halberd. Read it as *dùn*, the butt of a spear or halberd. The blade is in front, so it faces danger; the butt is behind, so it remains unharmed. Thus, it is said to rely on its position behind.

This is something even the common and mediocre see plainly, yet the wise and worthy cannot avoid it. *Yōng* means "the multitude"; *gōng* means "to examine in detail"—what the multitude sees and knows in detail. The worthy cannot avoid becoming the blade’s edge, for they are drawn by desire for profit. Thus, it is said they must have something to shield them.

What is meant by "those who follow" is not that they stagnate and do not act, congeal and do not flow. *Dǐ* is read as *zhǐ*. *Fā* means "to move." *Níng* is like congealed fat; *liú* means "to flow." What is valued is their harmony with the method and their accord with the times. *Zhōu* means "to harmonize"; *shù* means "technique." To accord with the times is to act when the time is right for action and to stop when the time is right for stopping.

Those who grasp the Dao and adapt to change may lead and thereby control those who follow, or follow and thereby control those who lead. The Dao should prevail over circumstances; adaptation to change need not wait upon taking the lead. Human affairs should come after, while seizing the moment should come first.

Why is this? Because if one does not lose what enables control over others, others cannot control them. The turning of the times allows no room for breath—so swift is the moment between reversal and counter-reversal. To lead is to overreach; to follow is to fall short.

The sun revolves and the moon completes its cycle; time does not move in step with man. Thus, the sage does not prize jade disks a foot in diameter but values an inch of time, for time is hard to gain and easy to lose.

When Yu hastened to seize the moment, he left his sandals behind and did not retrieve them, passed by his fallen cap and did not glance back. He did not contend to be first but to seize the right time.

Therefore, the sage maintains the pure Dao and embraces the feminine principle. *Qīng* means "harmonious and upright"; *cí* means "soft and weak." He responds to change by following along, always remaining behind rather than taking the lead. Soft and weak, tranquil and composed—*shū* means "unhurried"—he attacks great and hard obstacles, and none can contend with him. To "attack great and hard" is to overcome difficulties; none can contend with the sage.

Of all things under heaven, none is softer or weaker than water, yet its greatness cannot be fathomed, its depth cannot be measured. *Cè* means "to exhaust." It extends endlessly and flows boundlessly, now diminishing, now increasing, yet always beyond measure. *Zī* means "to calculate." It becomes rain and dew in the heavens and moistens the earth below, giving life to all things and bringing all affairs to completion. It embraces all living things without favor or aversion, bestowing its benefits even upon crawling insects and tiny creatures—*qí* means "to crawl"; *náo* refers to the smallest of creatures—yet seeks no reward. It gives without possessing.

The Way enriches all under heaven without exhaustion—*zhān* means "to suffice"; *jì* means "to deplete." Its virtue bestows upon the hundred clans without expense, for its blessings extend to the people without being counted as personal wealth. Its flow cannot be exhausted, its flowing essence never ceases. It is so subtle it cannot be grasped, struck without wounding, pierced without injury, severed without breaking, burned without igniting—such is the nature of water.

Soft and yielding, it flows and flees, intertwining in endless tangles—*shì* means "to escape"; *cuòmiù xiāngfēn* describes mutual entanglement—yet it cannot be scattered. Its sharpness pierces metal and stone, its strength sustains all under heaven: water wears away stone, demonstrating its keen edge; boats carry boundless weight, showing its might—*jì* means "to penetrate." It moves through formless realms and soars above the fleeting and boundless—*hū* means "elusive"; *qū* means "above," for it ascends as clouds without limit. It winds through rivers and valleys—*zhānhuí* means "to meander"—and surges across the vast wilds. In surplus or scarcity, it aligns with heaven and earth in giving and receiving, granting to the ten thousand things without preference. Thus, it is neither private nor public, for public and private become one.

Vast and surging, it harmonizes with the great oneness of heaven and earth—*hóng* means "great"; *dòng* means "pervading"; *tóng* here reads as "oneness." It favors neither left nor right, coiling and twisting in endless turns, beginning and ending with the ten thousand things—*zhěn* means "to revolve." This is called the supreme virtue, for water’s power is greatest, hence the term *supreme virtue*.

That water achieves such supreme virtue under heaven is due to its softness and smoothness. Thus, the words of Lao Dan say: "The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest. Emerging from non-being, it enters where there is no gap"—this describes water. "Thus I know the benefit of non-action," for it benefits all life.

The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great origin of sound. The formless gives birth to form, hence its title as the great ancestor. The soundless gives birth to sound, hence its title as the great origin—*zōng* means "root." Its child is light, its grandchild is water, both born of form. Light is formless, prized by the Dao; thus, it is called the child. Water, though formed, cannot be destroyed; thus, it is called the grandchild. Light can be seen but not grasped; water can be followed but not destroyed. Among all things with form, none is more revered than water.

Emerging into life and entering death, from non-being to being, from being to non-being—it thus declines and debases. "Emerging into life" means departing from purity; "entering death" means succumbing to desire—*zhí* means "to proceed." From formlessness to form is to stray from the root; from form to formlessness is to fail to return to what the Daoists discard. Hence, it is said to decline and debase.

Thus, stillness is the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the essence of the Dao—*yào* means "essential." Emptiness and tranquility are the use of the ten thousand things, for through them all things serve humanity. Responding with solemnity and returning to the root, one merges into formlessness. The so-called formless is called the One, for the One is the root of the Dao. The One is that which has no equal under heaven, standing alone and solitary. It reaches the nine heavens above and penetrates the nine wilds below—the nine heavens are the eight directions and the center; the nine wilds follow likewise. It is neither round nor square, vast and undifferentiated as one, layered yet rootless—*rootless* signifies its subtlety. It embraces heaven and earth, serving as the gateway of the Dao—*gate* is the gate of the Dao. Profound and hidden, pure virtue alone endures—*mùmǐn yǐnmǐn* describe the formless; *pure* means unadulterated. It bestows without exhaustion, and its use is never laborious—*jì* means "to deplete"; *qín* means "to toil."

Thus, gazing upon it, one sees no form; listening, one hears no sound; tracing it, one finds no body. From the formless, form arises—the formless is the Dao; form is the ten thousand things. From the soundless, the five tones resound—sound is born of silence. From the tasteless, the five flavors take shape—*shape* may also read as *harmony*. From the colorless, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and substance emerges from emptiness. Form arises from the formless—this refers to humanity. *Substance* means wealth; when the world is enclosed, name and reality dwell together—*enclosure* means "corner"; *name* refers to titles and ranks, *reality* to goods like silk. Another interpretation: rewards for benevolence and righteousness.

The notes of sound do not exceed five—*gōng, shāng, jué, zhǐ, yǔ*—yet the variations of the five tones are endless—*variations* means mutual generation. The harmonies of taste do not exceed five—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent—yet the transformations of the five flavors are beyond tasting—*transformation* also means change. The hues of color do not exceed five—blue, red, white, black, yellow—yet the variations of the five colors are beyond beholding—*chángshì* means "ordinary sight"; *fēicháng* means "extraordinary vision," as when Duke Yin of Lu observed fishing at Tang.

Thus, in sound, when *gōng* is established, the five tones take shape—*gōng* stands at the center, master of sound; *shape* means "to rectify." In flavor, when sweetness is established, the five flavors are harmonized—*harmonized* means "balanced"; sweetness is the central taste. In color, when white is established, the five colors are completed—white can be dyed in any hue, hence the five colors are achieved. In the Dao, when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born.

Thus, the principle of the One extends to the four seas—*principle* means the Dao. The understanding of the One pervades heaven and earth—*understanding* means "to penetrate"; *pervade* means "to reach the mechanism." This *understanding* is the same as the *understanding* in "to comprehend."

In its wholeness, it is pure as uncarved jade—*uncarved* means jade still embedded in stone, uncut. In its dispersion, it is turbid as muddied waters—yet turbid waters gradually clear, and emptiness gradually fills. Still as a deep abyss—*still* means unmoving. Drifting as floating clouds—seeming not to exist yet existing, seeming to vanish yet enduring.

The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture—*sum* means "gathering of the many." The root of the hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate—the gate of the Dao. Its movement is formless, its transformations divine. Its course knows no nearness, yet it is always last to arrive and first to precede—the precedence of the Dao.

Therefore, the governance of the perfected person—the person of utmost Dao—veils their keen insight, effaces their adornments, abides by the Dao and discards cunning, and emerges with the people from impartiality—*impartiality* means "uprightness." [They restrict what they hold to, diminish what they seek,]#2 abandon allurements and desires—*allurements* refers to craving for glory and power, hence they are abandoned; *desires* refers to emotional cravings, hence they are removed. They reduce their thoughts and cares—*constant* means "vast and still." Restricting what they hold to brings clarity, free from disturbance. Diminishing what they seek brings attainment—for it is easy to provide.

Those who rely on ears and eyes to hear and see exhaust their forms yet remain unclear. Those who govern through knowledge and deliberation strain their minds yet achieve nothing. Thus, the sage uniformly follows the track—*uniformly* means "to align"; *track* means "the standard." They do not alter what is fitting, nor change what is constant. They model themselves on the level and the marking-line, bending only where appropriate.

Joy and anger are the deviations of the Dao—the Dao values equilibrium and harmony, hence joy and anger are deviations. Sorrow and grief are the losses of virtue—virtue esteems serenity and harmony, hence sorrow and grief are losses. As the *Analects* says: "Their virtue is broad and unobstructed." Preference and aversion are the faults of the heart. Cravings and desires are the burdens of nature—the heart should be focused; when inner gates are sealed and outer ones closed, yet preferences and aversions arise, this is called *fault*. Nature should be clear and still to serve Heaven’s purity, yet cravings and desires arise, hence they are called *burdens*.

Great anger shatters the yin; great joy topples the yang—anger is yin qi; yin congeals into solid ice, and when accumulated yin forces press against one another, yin is shattered. Joy is yang qi; when yang ascends above, and accumulated yang forces press against one another, yang is said to topple. When qi presses and surges, speech is lost; when terror and fright arise, madness follows. Excessive sorrow and resentment breed illness and accumulation. Excessive preferences and aversions bring calamity in their wake.

Thus, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue. Unchanging in its openness is the perfection of stillness—*unchanging* means "without alteration." Free from cravings and desires is the perfection of emptiness—*free from* means "not carried by nature." Without preferences or aversions is the perfection of equilibrium. Unscattered by things is the perfection of purity—*scattered* means "disordered"; *purity* means "unmixed." One who masters these five attains communion with the divine—*communion with the divine* means "grasping the inner." Thus, by the center controlling the outer, the hundred affairs are not neglected—*center* means "the heart"; *outer* means "emotions and desires." When the center is attained, the outer is gathered. Without cultivation, the center’s attainment brings peace to the five viscera and balance to thoughts and cares—*peace in the five viscera* means each finds its proper place; *balance in thoughts and cares* means eliminating reckless joy and anger. Sinews and strength become robust, ears and eyes keen. One is unobstructed yet not perverse—*perverse* means "erroneous"—and firm yet not brittle—*brittle* means "broken." Without great excess, nothing is beyond reach. In small matters, one is not constrained; in great matters, one is not slack—small in smallness, great in greatness. Their spirit is not restless, their mind not vexed—*restless* means "fickle and troubled." Their essence and spirit are settled.

Serene and silent, they become the leader of the world—*serene* means "clear and still"; *silent* means "tranquil and indifferent." Pressed, they can respond; moved, they can act. Things are harmonious without end—*harmonious* means "beautiful." Transformations have no fixed form—this speaks of their power to change. Leisurely and unconstrained, they are like echo to sound, like shadow to form. Ascending heights and gazing down, they never lose their grasp; treading peril and traversing danger, they never forget the mysterious staff—*mysterious staff* means the Dao. One who preserves this finds their virtue unblemished.

The ten thousand things, tangled and intertwined, transform with them. In governing the world, it is like riding with the wind at one’s back—swift and effortless. This is called *utmost virtue*. In utmost virtue, there is joy.

The ancients had those who dwelt in mountain caves yet whose spirit did not stray—*stray* means "lost." In later ages, there were those who wielded the power of ten thousand chariots yet suffered daily sorrow and grief. From this, we see that sageliness lies not in governing others but in attaining the Dao; joy lies not in wealth and nobility but in the harmony of virtue.

One who knows the greatness of the self and the smallness of the world draws near to the Dao—*draws near* means "approaches"; this refers to Xu You and Wu Guang. What is called *joy*—must it be dwelling in the grand towers of Jingtái and Zhānghuá—both great towers of Chu—roaming Cloud Dream and Shaqiu—*Cloud Dream* is a marsh of Chu, in Huáróng of Nánjùn; *Shaqiu* is the name of a tower of Zhòu, in Jùlù—listening to the *Nine Shao* and *Six Ying*—*Nine Shao* is the music of Shùn; *Ying* is the music of Zhuānxū—savoring rich and fragrant delicacies, galloping on level roads, delighting in the pleasures of fishing and hunting swans and egrets—*swans and egrets* are bird names; long-necked and green-bodied, their form resembles geese. Some say they are alternate names for the phoenix.

What I call *joy* is when a person attains what they should attain. One who attains what they should attain does not find joy in extravagance nor sorrow in frugality—*frugality* means "thrift."

With yin they close together, with yang they open as one. Thus Zixia’s heart waged war and grew emaciated, yet attained the Dao and grew plump. Zixia, named Shang, was a disciple of Confucius. Entering the academy, he beheld the Way of the Former Kings and delighted in it; stepping forth, he saw the pleasures of wealth and nobility and desired them. The two contended within him, so his heart waged war and he grew emaciated. When the Way of the Former Kings prevailed, he had no further thoughts, and so grew plump.

The sage does not enslave the self to things, nor does he disturb harmony with desire. He does not make the self a servant to things, nor does he disorder the central harmony of the Dao with emotions and desires. Thus his joy is not exultant—exultation would be excessive restraint—and his sorrow is not grieving—grieving would harm his nature. Though the world’s ten thousand directions and hundred changes sway and drift without fixed abode, I alone stand resolute, leaving things behind to emerge with the Dao as one. Thus I possess that by which I attain my own nature.

Beneath the tall trees, within the hollow caves, this suffices to satisfy the heart. The tall trees are lofty and sparse, the yin-woods of the heights. The hollow caves are the grottoes of the cliffs. Only one who attains his own nature can dwell here and suffice to satisfy his heart and nature. Without that by which one attains one’s own nature, though one make the world one’s home and the myriad people one’s servants and concubines, it is not enough to nourish life. This speaks of one who lacks that by which he attains his own nature, and thus finds even this insufficient.

One who can reach the state of no-joy attains joy in all things; attaining joy in all things, one reaches the ultimate joy. The ultimate joy is the joy of the ultimate virtue. *Ultimate* here means *supreme*.

Now they erect bells and drums, array pipes and strings, spread felt carpets, adorn with yak-tail banners and ivory ornaments—*pipes* are flutes; *strings* are zithers and lutes; *adorn* means "to embellish"; *yak-tail* refers to banners; *ivory* refers to ornaments made of ivory. The ear listens to the decadent music of *Zhaoge* and the northern borderlands—*Zhaoge* was the capital of Zhòu; *borderlands* refers to towns. Zhòu commanded Master Jue to compose the decadent music of the border towns. Thus when Master Yan sang it for Duke Ping of Jin, Master Kuang recognized it, saying, "This is the sound of a doomed state." They display ranks of alluring beauties—*display* means "to arrange"; *alluring* means "beautiful"—pass around wine cups, and revel night into day, their pleasures unceasing.

They draw mighty crossbows to shoot high-flying birds, unleash hunting dogs to chase swift hares—such are their pleasures, blazing and resplendent, stirring the heart with restless longing. *Longing* means yearning for advancement; *restless* is akin to alarmed. When they unharness the chariots and rest the horses, cease the wine and stow the music, their hearts suddenly feel as though something is lost, forlorn as if something has vanished. Why is this? They do not cultivate inner joy to guide the outer, but instead seek outer joy to fill the inner. When the music begins, they rejoice; when the melody ends, they grieve—joy and sorrow shift and give rise to one another, their spirits disordered and unsettled, never finding a moment’s peace. *Disordered* means confused.

Examine the cause of this formless disquiet: it is the inability to grasp the true form of joy. Day by day, it harms their lives, for they have lost what they ought to attain. Thus, when the inner self finds no fulfillment within, it borrows from without to adorn itself—yet this does not seep into the skin, nor penetrate to the bone and marrow. *Seep* means to moisten; *penetrate* means to permeate. It does not linger in the heart’s resolve, nor lodge in the five viscera. Therefore, what enters from without finds no master within and does not abide; what emerges from within finds no response without and does not flow.

Hence, when wise counsel or clever plans are heard, even fools delight in them; when supreme virtue or lofty conduct is praised, even the unworthy yearn for them. Those who delight in such words are many, yet those who apply them are few; those who yearn for such ways are numerous, yet those who practice them are scarce.

Why is this so? It is because they cannot return to their inherent nature. Those who lack inner clarity yet force themselves to study and inquire do not truly hear with their ears, nor do their hearts grasp what they learn. How does this differ from a deaf man’s singing—mimicking others’ voices without finding joy in it? The sound leaves his mouth and scatters, vanishing so that even his own ears do not hear it.

The heart is the master of the five viscera, governing the four limbs, circulating blood and qi, galloping through the realm of right and wrong, and passing in and out through the gateways of a hundred affairs. Thus, if the heart does not attain its proper state yet seeks to order the qi of all under heaven, it is like trying to tune bells and drums without ears, or delighting in patterns and colors without eyes—it will surely fail in its task. *Order* means to regulate.

Therefore, the divine vessel of all under heaven cannot be forcibly governed. *Vessel* refers to an instrument of use; *govern* means to manage. Those who govern it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. When Xu You deemed all under heaven insignificant and would not exchange himself for Yao, his resolve transcended the world. Xu You was a man of Yangcheng and a recluse on Mount Ji. Yao, recognizing his worth, sought him out, wishing to cede the throne to him, but he refused. Thus it is said his resolve transcended the world.

Why was this so? Because he acted in accordance with the world for the sake of the world. The essence of all under heaven does not lie in another but in oneself. *Another* refers to Yao; *oneself* refers to Xu You. It does not rest in others but in one’s own person. When the self is fulfilled, the myriad things are complete. When the discourse on the art of the heart is thoroughly understood, desires, aversions, likes, and hatreds lie beyond it—external to the heart. Thus, there is nothing to delight in and nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in and nothing to suffer. The myriad things are united in mystery. *Mystery* is heaven. There is no wrong and no right; transformation and nurturance shine in mystery, living as though dead. *Mystery* is heaven; *shine* means brightness. Living as though dead means having no desires.

All under heaven is also mine, and I am also possessed by all under heaven. Between all under heaven and myself, is there any separation? They are comparable. Does possessing all under heaven necessarily mean seizing power, wielding authority, controlling life and death, and issuing decrees? What I call possessing all under heaven is not this—it is self-attainment alone. Attaining one’s heavenly nature, or in other words, not losing one’s true self. When the self is attained, all under heaven also attains me. When I and all under heaven attain one another, we perpetually possess each other. How then could there be no room for such attainment?

What is called self-attainment is preserving one’s person. Preserving one’s person is to become one with the Dao. Thus, though one roams the riverbanks and seashores—*riverbanks* meaning cliffs, *shores* meaning edges—dons fine robes of layered kudzu, rides swift steeds with kingfisher canopies, and travels ten thousand li in a day—*swift steeds* being the name of a horse breed, *kingfisher canopy* adorned with kingfisher feathers—gazes upon the martial dances of waving plumes, listens to the resounding, clear, and exquisite melodies of stirring and twisting tunes—*stirring* and *twisting* being names of musical pieces—indulges in the vast pleasures of Zheng and Wei, and weaves the lingering echoes of Chu’s music—*Zheng music* refers to when the Duke of Jin, Ping, delighted in new sounds, and Shi Yan composed the music of Sangjian and Puzhou, which lay in Wei territory, hence the vast pleasures of Zheng and Wei; *weaving* means to bind the clear sounds of Chu, inevitably becoming the vulgar music of Zheng—though one binds the clear sounds of Chu for amusement, *lingering echoes* being the remnants of its music, hunts the high-flying birds of marsh and shore, and pursues the running beasts of parks and gardens, this is how the common people become licentious, dissipated, and lost in excess. *Common* means ordinary people.

Yet the sage dwells amidst these things without allowing them to disturb his spirit or disorder his qi and resolve. *Disturb* means to confuse, causing the heart to lose its true nature in alarm. Living in a remote and secluded village, beside streams and valleys—*beside* means to dwell—hidden among thickets and undergrowth—*thickets* being dense woods, *undergrowth* being deep grass—in a walled hut thatched with rough grass, with a door of woven reeds and a window of broken pottery, its hinge made of twisted mulberry, where the roof leaks and the floor is damp, moisture seeping into the northern chamber—*seeping* means to soak, *northern chamber* being the shady hall—where snow and frost descend, nourishing gourds and reeds—*descend* describes the appearance of snow and frost; *nourishing* means the moisture that fosters gourds and reeds, the fruit of the gourd being the reed’s fruit, its grain called *su*; *su* is read as the *sui* in *suisheng*, *descend* is read as the *xiao* in *xiaomie*, *gourd* is read as the *gu* in *guzai*, and *reed* is read as the *jiang* in *shuijiang*—wandering freely in broad marshes and drifting along mountain gorges—*gorges* being the space between two mountains—this is what the common people find burdensome, sorrowful, and unfulfilling.

Yet the sage dwells here without becoming distressed or resentful, never losing what brings him joy. Why is this?

Then within, one connects to the celestial mechanism—*mechanism* meaning inception—without allowing rank or poverty, toil or ease to disrupt one’s resolve or virtue. Thus, when the crow caws and the magpie chatters, do they ever alter their cries for cold or heat, dryness or damp? This speaks of those who embody the Dao: they do not shift their aspirations for wealth or poverty, toil or ease, just as birds do not change their calls for the seasons.

Therefore, once the Dao is attained and settled, one does not await the shifting tides of the myriad things. It is not through fleeting transformations that I secure what I have gained. What I call attainment is the natural disposition of life and destiny resting in its proper place. For life and destiny emerge together with form from their source—*source* meaning root. When form is complete, life and destiny are fulfilled, and with their fulfillment, preferences and aversions arise.

Thus, the scholar holds to unchanging principles, and the woman maintains steadfast conduct. Scholars share a common purpose—*common purpose* meaning virtue—yet in their interactions, a single encounter may establish a public consensus, hence the saying, "the scholar has unchanging discourse." The chaste woman remains single-minded, without duplicity; even in widowhood, she does not remarry, hence the saying, "she has unwavering conduct." Compass and square cannot make true circles and squares, nor can hooks and plumb lines enforce curves and straightness. Though compass and square, hook and plumb line exist, they have no application here.

The enduring vastness of heaven and earth: ascending a hill does not make one tall, nor does dwelling in lowliness make one short. Thus, one who has attained the Dao is impoverished yet unafraid, prosperous yet not elated—though destitute and lowly, they feel no dread; though eminent and successful, they feel no pride. They stand high without peril—*peril* meaning danger—hold fullness without toppling—*toppling* meaning collapse. They are new yet not ostentatious—*ostentatious* meaning showy—enduring yet unchanging—*unchanging* meaning alteration. *Ostentatious* is read as the *yu* in *Yuling* of Runan. They enter fire without scorching, enter water without getting wet.

Thus, they need not rely on power to be revered, nor on wealth to be rich, nor on force to be strong. Abiding in emptiness and humility, they soar with transformation—*soar* meaning to incline and rise. Such a one may hide gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths, as Shun concealed gold in Mount Jin and pearls in the Five Lakes to curb the desires of greed and excess. They do not profit from goods or wealth, nor covet power or fame—*power* referring to rank, *fame* to titles and names.

Thus, they do not find joy in comfort—*comfort* meaning ease—nor sorrow in hardship—*hardship* meaning constraint. *Constraint* is read as the *qian* in *pixiangqian*. They do not find security in nobility nor peril in lowliness. Form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place, following the course of heaven and earth.

For form is the dwelling of life, qi is the vitality of life, and spirit is the regulator of life. If any one of these loses its place, the other two are harmed. Therefore, the sage ensures each occupies its proper station, guards its role, and does not encroach upon the others. Thus, if form is not at ease in its place, it decays; if qi is not properly vitalized, it dissipates; if spirit acts where it does not belong, it grows dim—*dim* meaning unclear. These two must be guarded with utmost care.

Even the myriad creatures of the world—creeping insects and wriggling worms—*creeping insects* referring to those that crawl, *wriggling worms* to those with slender waists—know their likes and dislikes, their benefits and harms. Why? Because their nature resides within and never departs.

Should it suddenly depart, bones and flesh lose all coherence. To depart—meaning to act contrary—causes flesh and bone to dissolve, leaving no match or peer.

Now, how is it that man can clearly see, keenly hear, his frame stand upright, and his hundred joints flex and extend? How can he distinguish white from black, perceive ugliness and beauty, and discern sameness from difference, right from wrong? It is because qi fills him and spirit directs him.

How do we know this is so? In all men, the will has its focus, and spirit its target—this is how they move. Their feet stumble into pits, their heads strike against posts, yet they remain unaware. *Stumble* means to trip; the people of Chu pronounce *trip* as *stumble*. *Aware* means to perceive. They may be beckoned yet cannot see, called yet cannot hear—unable to see the one who beckons, unable to hear the one who calls. Their ears and eyes have not left them, yet they cannot respond. Why? Because spirit has lost its station. When essence and spirit lose their proper place, then:

Focus on the small, and the great is forgotten;
focus on the center, and the outer is forgotten;
focus above, and the lower is forgotten;
focus left, and the right is forgotten.

Like the case of Chu’s Duke Bai of Gong, who, plotting rebellion, stood in court with his staff inverted, its tip piercing his skull until blood streamed to the ground—yet he felt nothing. Such are these instances.

Where there is nothing it does not fill, there is nowhere it does not reside.

The spirit fills all without exception. "In" means to reside. Thus, those who value emptiness take the tip of a hair as their dwelling. Emptiness means the mind harbors no thoughts or concerns. Taking the tip of a hair as their dwelling signifies the utmost subtlety.

Consider the madman who cannot avoid the dangers of water and fire or surmount the perils of ditches and chasms—does he lack form, spirit, qi, or will? No, yet his use of them differs from others. He has lost the proper station of his spirit and departed from the inner and outer abodes of his being. Thus, his actions and movements never align; his stillness and motion never hit the mark. "Align" means to fit; "hit the mark" means to be fitting.

All his life, he drags his withered form through crooked gates and uneven thresholds—"drags" means to move; "pushes and assists" signifies affliction; "form" means the body; "through" means within. "Crooked gates" are like winding paths, a kind of convolution. "Uneven thresholds" are not level. "Crooked" is read as *lián*, like the *lián* in *línglóng* (intricate); "thresholds" is read as *liè*, like the *liè* in *lièliè* (uneven). And he stumbles into filthy ravines and bottomless pits. "Filthy ravines" are great chasms; "ravines" is read as *hè*, like the *hè* in *hèhè* (bright).

Though born equal to others, he cannot escape being mocked and ridiculed. Why? Because form and spirit have parted ways. Thus, those who take spirit as their master find their form following to their benefit; those who take form as their ruler find their spirit following to their harm. Spirit is clear and still, hence beneficial; form is moved by passions and desires, hence harmful.

The greedy and covetous, obsessed with power and profit, lured and enticed by fame and rank—"obsessed" is like being dull and unaware, as if their feet were led astray; "lured" means to covet; "obsessed" is read as *mò*, like the *mò* in *mònì* (drowning). *Mò* is read as *zhī*, like the *zhī* in *juàn* (silk), dense and without gaps—hoping with their superior wisdom to stand above the world, "hoping" means to aspire; "stand" means to establish, aspiring to establish a lofty name in the world. Yet their spirit daily wanes and drifts ever farther. "Wanes" means to diminish; "drifts" means to depart without return. When the form is blocked and obstructed within, the spirit has no way to enter. "Spirit" means the essence of spirit; its clear and still nature has no path to return.

Thus, the world often suffers from blindness, delusion, and self-loss—like the case of a candle: the brighter the flame, the swifter its consumption. "Brighter" means to increase; "swifter" means to hasten.

The essence of spirit, qi, and will—when still, daily grows full and thus strengthens; when restless, daily depletes and thus ages. Therefore, the sage, in nurturing their spirit, harmonizes and softens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, and moves with the Dao in rise and fall, bow and lift. Rise and fall are like flourishing and decline; bow and lift are like ascent and descent.

In tranquility, they let it flow freely; in urgency, they employ it. When flowing freely, it is like a discarded robe; when employed, it is like the release of a crossbow’s trigger. The trigger is the mechanism of the crossbow, speaking of its swiftness.

Thus, the transformations of the myriad things are all met in due time—"met" means at the proper moment—and the changes of the hundred affairs are all responded to—"responded" means appropriately addressed.

*End of the Second Scroll of the* Huainanzi Honglie Jie

*Colophon: Recorded by the Grand Commandant and Libationer, Your Servant Xu Shen*

**The Inaugural Truth, Part One**

*Chu* means "beginning." *Zhen* means the true reality of the spoken Dao. Beginning from Non-Being, it transforms and nurtures into Being—thus it is called "embracing truth." This is why the chapter is so titled.

There is a beginning: the inception of Heaven and Earth. There is that which precedes the beginning of the beginning: the first stirrings of the myriad things before any inception. There is a beginning: the formation of shapes. There is that which precedes the beginning of what precedes the beginning: when Heaven and Earth conjoined their qi, silent and desolate, before any inception existed. What precedes the beginning of the beginning is but a faint semblance.

There is Being: the first signs and shapes of the myriad things. There is Non-Being: the vastness of Heaven and Earth, beyond naming. There is that which precedes the existence of Being and Non-Being, and that which precedes the beginning of what precedes the existence of Being and Non-Being.

The so-called "beginning" refers to when the teeming masses had not yet dispersed, when sprouts and shoots had not yet taken form, when no boundaries or edges existed, when the formless writhed and squirmed—about to arise but not yet manifest as distinct kinds. *Fanfen* describes the appearance of accumulated masses; *fa* means "to burst forth."

There is that which precedes the beginning of the beginning: when the qi of Heaven first descended and the qi of Earth first ascended, when yin and yang intermingled, freely roaming and vying in harmony within the cosmos. Clothed in virtue and containing harmony, they gathered in profusion like tangled vines, desiring to engage with things yet leaving no trace or sign. *Jing* means "to pursue"; *chang*, "to extend." *He* is qi. *Binfan* means "intermixed." *Longcong* means "to assemble." *Zhaozhen* refers to strange forms.

There is that which precedes the beginning of what precedes the beginning of the beginning: when Heaven contained harmony but had not yet sent it down, when Earth held qi but had not yet raised it—void and silent, desolate and boundless, with no semblance to be found, when qi flowed unimpeded into the great obscurity. *Xiao* is read as the *xiao* in *ganxiao* ("deep blue silk"). *Diao* is the *di* in the surname *Dishi*.

There is Being: when the myriad things scatter and fall, their roots, stems, branches, and leaves verdant and lush, their colors resplendent and dazzling, when winged creatures fly and wriggling things move, when crawling things creep and panting things breathe—all tangible, graspable, and measurable. *Can* is read as the *can* in *canxing* ("the three stars"). *Guanhuo xuanghuang* describes the appearance of colors. *Qi* is read as the *qi* in *cheqi zhe* ("wheel tracks"). *Kuai* is read as the *kuai* in *bu shuo ze wai* ("unwilling to choose the outer"). *Qie* means "to rub"; *xun*, "to follow." *Guan* is read as *wei* ("only"); *huo* is read as *hu* ("to guard").

There is Non-Being: invisible in form, inaudible in sound, untouchable to the hand, unbounded to the gaze—vast and boundless, beyond containment or governance, immeasurably vast. *Haohao hanhan* describes boundless expanse. *Guangyao* is formless.

There is that which precedes the existence of Being and Non-Being: it envelops Heaven and Earth, shapes the myriad things, and flows unimpeded through the great obscurity. Profound and expansive, it has no exterior; minute and precise, it has no interior. Without walls or enclosures, it gives rise to the root of Being and Non-Being. *Hun* refers to the state of the perfected person in profound obscurity—this is the Dao.

There is that which precedes the beginning of what precedes the existence of Being and Non-Being: when Heaven and Earth had not yet split, when yin and yang had not yet divided, when separation and distinction were undifferentiated. When the four seasons had not yet emerged, when the myriad things had not yet arisen—all was vast, still, and limpid, with no form to be seen. *Wang* is read as in *chuan shi zhu Zhou shi zhi wang* ("the vastness of the Zhou clan’s ancestral transmissions"). Like light shining between Non-Being, it recedes and vanishes from sight. To vanish is to be unseen.

The Master said: "I can grasp Being and Non-Being, yet I cannot grasp Non-Being of Non-Being. To grasp Being and Non-Being is action, but to be fundamentally non-active in one’s inherent nature—this I have not yet attained. Thus it is said I cannot grasp Non-Being. When one attains Non-Being of Non-Being, how could such supreme subtlety be reached?

The great clod burdens me with form, wearies me with life—the great clod being the space between Heaven and Earth. It grants me ease in old age, repose in death. As Zhuangzi said: 'Life is corvée labor; death is rest.' Thus it is said to grant me repose in death. To treat my life well is to treat my death well. To delight in the goodness of my life is to desire the goodness of my death. Understanding the transformations of death and the awareness therein, one seeks to reconcile life and death as one.

Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh—people call this secure. Yet in the dead of night, a strong man may bear them away in flight. The sleeper knows nothing; still, they have slipped away. If one hides the world within the world, then no form can escape. The great person takes the world as their chamber, storing all things within. How could one say there is no vast upheaval? *Yanghuo*—a term for boundless magnitude—*huo* is read as in *Gaojing* (the capital of Zhou).

A single encounter with human form brings joy—*fan* means 'to meet' or 'to suffer,' but here it signifies 'to mold' or 'to pattern.' Even when things imitate human form, they are deemed good. Yet for humans, there are ten thousand transformations without end. Life and death shift like dreams; thus it is said there is no ultimate limit. Worn out and then renewed—how could the joy therein be measured?

It is like one who becomes a bird and soars in the sky, or becomes a fish and plunges into the depths. While in that state, one does not know it; only upon waking does one recognize it. Now, when the great awakening comes, only then will we know that this present state is the great dream. Before I was born, how could I have known the joy of life? Now that I have not yet died, how could I know that death is not joy?

Long ago, Gongniu Ai suffered a transforming illness. After seven days, he became a tiger. *Zhuanbing* means 'changing illness.' In the region between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, the Gongniu clan had a condition where one would transform into a tiger—like those in the Central States who suffer from madness, with outbreaks at certain times. Those who became tigers would then eat people, and those who ate people became true tigers. Those who did not eat people would transform back into humans.

Gongniu was a man of Han, from the Huai-Nan region. Because cattle eat grass, they are called *chuhuan* ('grass-fed'), and this case serves as proof. His brother peered through the door to observe him, but the tiger pounced and killed him."

Yan means "sudden." *Chan* means "to observe." Thus, when the body becomes that of a beast, claws and fangs transform—this transformation means human claws and fangs become those of a tiger. Will and heart change; spirit and form shift. Will and heart both alter; spirit and form both transform. When one is a tiger, one does not recall having been human; when one is human, one does not foresee becoming a tiger. These two states alternate and diverge, each delighting in its formed shape. *Dai* means "to replace"; *xie*, "to unfold"; *chuan*, "to clash." *Xing* refers to the formed shape of tiger or human. *Chuan* is read as in *chuanmai*. Cunning or dull, kind or cruel, right or wrong—none knows whence these arise. *Meng* means "to arise."

Water, when winter comes, congeals into ice; ice, when spring arrives, melts and becomes water. Ice and water transform before and after, like a millstone turning in haste—who has leisure to know what brings suffering or joy? *Pan* means "to dissolve"; *qu*, "to return." Thus, when form is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, or dampness, the form withers while the spirit remains strong. *Yuan* means "withered and ailing"; *zhuang*, "harmed." *Yuan* is read as in Nanyang *Yuan*. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, or worry, the spirit is exhausted while the form lingers. Thus, when an old horse dies, flaying it reveals dryness like withered wood. *Pi* means "aged." Its qi and strength are spent, hence it resembles withered wood. When a young dog dies, flaying it remains moist. *Jiao* means "young"; *ru*, "moist." Its qi and strength are not yet exhausted. Therefore, those who die from harm have ghosts that are restless—*rao* means "vexing and restless," prone to inflicting illness upon people. Those who die in their time have spirits that are serene. *Ji* means "exhausted."

When one reaches the proper time of old age, the spirit becomes serene and still. *Mo* means "settled." In all these cases, form and spirit do not perish together. Daoists cultivate both form and spirit to achieve death in old age. When form and spirit perish together, it is not merely that both become still.

Laozi said: "One who governs the world with the Dao—its ghosts possess no numinous power." This is what is meant by "perishing together." The sage’s mind relies on nature and leans upon the spirit, the two supporting each other to complete the cycle of beginning and end. Thus, in sleep, they are not [disturbed]; in wakefulness, they are not anxious. Their essence and spirit harbor no thoughts or worries, hence no [disturbance]. Their will abides in benevolence and righteousness, and no calamity befalls them, hence no anxiety.

In ancient times, there were those who dwelled in primordial chaos, their spirit and qi undispersed outwardly. All things were tranquil and still, delighting in quietude. The baleful qi of comets and the handle of the Northern Dipper could not inflict harm. In that age, the people roamed wildly, knowing neither east nor west, wandering with food in their mouths, striking their bellies in play. *Gu* means "to strike"; *xi*, "to frolic." They were enveloped by the harmony of heaven and nourished by the virtue of earth. *Jiao* means "both"; *he*, "qi"; *de* of earth, "the five grains." Without cunning schemes, they did not blame one another for faults. In boundless vastness, this was called Great Governance. *Qugu* means "crafty contrivance"; *you*, "fault." *Mangmang chenchen* describes a state of abundance. *Mang* is read as in Wang Mang; *chen*, as in the phrase "water flows *chenchen* from Shenbai."

Thus, those in positions of authority guided and employed the people without corrupting their nature; they pacified and governed them without altering their virtue.

Thus, benevolence and righteousness were not spread abroad, yet the myriad things flourished and multiplied. In ancient times, those who embraced abundant virtue, dwelling in primal simplicity, did not rely on benevolence and righteousness for the myriad things to flourish and multiply.

Rewards and punishments were not applied, yet the world submitted in reverence—submitting to their virtue. Their Way could give rise to great beauty, yet it could not be grasped through calculation or enumeration. It is said that the great nature of the myriad things may be nurtured through great beauty, but it cannot be fully accounted for by reckoning. Therefore, to tally by the day is insufficient, while to tally by the year is more than enough—measured by limits, it thus abounds.

It is like the plum: a hundred plums suffice to make a hundred people taste sourness, but one plum cannot make a hundred people taste sourness. Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao. Each attains their aspiration and thus forgets the other.

The True Person of old stood at the root of heaven and earth, dwelling in utmost ease, embracing virtue and warming themselves in harmonious qi, so that the myriad things ripened in abundance. *Yang* means "to warm"; they held fast to their virtuous aspiration and warmed themselves in harmonious qi, so the myriad things ripened, meaning they came to fruition. *Yang* is read as in "to nourish" (*yang* of *gongyang*).

Who would deign to entangle themselves in the affairs of the human world, thereby troubling their nature and destiny with external things? *Jiegou* means "to assemble" or "to engage"; *fan* means "to defile."

The Dao has its warp and weft, its branches and connections. The Way of attaining the One links a thousand boughs and ten thousand leaves. The One is the root of the Dao. Grasping the root, one may order a thousand branches and ten thousand leaves, governing the many through the few.

Thus, the noble have means to enact commands; the base have means to forget their lowliness. The poor have means to delight in their work; the distressed have means to endure peril. Only when bitter cold arrives and frost and snow descend does one recognize the flourishing of the pine and cypress. When peril is trodden and danger confronted, with profit and harm arrayed before them—*chen* means "to array"—only then does one recognize that the sage does not lose the Dao.

Therefore, those who can bear the great circle of heaven tread the great square of earth. Those who mirror the Great Purity gaze upon the great brightness. Those who establish Great Peace dwell in the Great Hall. Great Peace is the peace of all under heaven; the Great Hall is the Bright Hall, where the first day of the month is announced and commands are issued.

Those who wander in the obscure shine with the same light as the sun and moon—*guang* means "brightness." Those who discourse on the virtue of the Dao can shine with the brightness of the sun and moon. Thus, take the Dao as your pole, virtue as your line, ritual and music as your hook, benevolence and righteousness as your bait. Cast them into the rivers, float them upon the seas, and the myriad things, teeming and swarming—what is not yours?

Yet those who rely on the arts of *qiyue*—*qiyue* means "limping" or "uneven," the crooked Way—drag and haul the affairs of the human world, stirring and shaking the customs of the age. *Dan* means "to draw"; *shan* means "profit"; *tingnuo* means "up and down," seeking advantage and convenience. Groping and probing the subtleties of things—*mosu* means "to grope," and "subtleties" means "minute details"—they still indulge their ambitions and sate their desires. How much more so for those who embrace the Way of *xiangzhang*, forgetting their liver and gall, leaving behind their ears and eyes, drifting alone beyond all bounds, not entangled with things in wearisome toil—*bisa* means "to mix and grind." *Bi* is read as in "to trudge" (*ba* of *qishe*); *sa* is read as in the Chu word for "to kill."

They wander in the formless realm, harmonizing with heaven and earth. Such as these lay aside their keen perception and embrace their primal simplicity—*su* means "primal nature." They regard profit and harm as dust and grime—dust and grime are metaphors for the trivial. They regard life and death as day and night.

Thus, the sight of jade chariots adorned with *wanyan* and ivory, the sound of *Baixue* and *Qingjiao* in their ears, cannot disturb their spirit. *Yulu* is the chariot of kings, adorned with *wanyan* (fine jade) and ivory. *Baixue* is the melody played by Shi Kuang on the five-stringed zither of Taiyi, a divine instrument whose music summons the descent of spirits. *Qingjiao* is the note of the Shang mode.

Ascending a thousand-fathom gorge, standing at the edge of a dizzying precipice, is not enough to disrupt their harmony—monkeys at such a height grow dizzy, and *hua* means "to disturb." *He* means "harmony" or "ease." It is like the jade of Zhongshan, smelted with furnace and charcoal for three days and nights, yet its luster remains unchanged. Such is the essence of utmost virtue and the essence of heaven and earth. Zhongshan is Kunlun.

Therefore, life is not enough to employ them; how could profit move them? Death is not enough to restrain them; how could harm frighten them? Understanding the distinction between life and death, comprehending the changes of profit and harm, even if all under heaven were exchanged for a single hair on their shin, it would not sway their resolve. *Gan* refers to the part of the leg from the knee to the ankle; *gan* is read as in "to close" (*bi* of *bishou*).

The noble and base in relation to the self are like the timely passing of the *tiaofeng*—*tiaofeng* whistles through the branches, swift in its passage. *Li* means "to pass." Praise and blame in relation to the self are like the passing of a single mosquito. Those who hold fast to purity and do not darken it, who act with integrity and do not adulterate it, who dwell in the dark and obscure yet are not benighted, who rest in the harmony of heaven yet do not falter—*wei* means "to fail." The *Tianjun* is the land of the North Pole, a wild expanse of accumulated cold; resting there leads to ruin, but those who embody the Dao do not fail.

Mengmen and Zhonglong cannot bar their way—Mengmen is a mountain name, a pass of Taihang. Zhonglong is Zhongnan Mountain in Fufeng, both perilous strongholds. Only those who embody the Dao remain unobstructed. Rushing rapids, swirling abysses, the depths of Lüliang cannot detain them—*tuanlai* are swift currents; *xuanyuan* are deep whirlpools; Lüliang is a river in Pengcheng, all treacherous waters that cause stagnation. The perils of Taihang, Shijian, Feihu, and Juwang cannot hinder them—Taihang lies north of Yewang, a pass of Shangdang. Shijian are deep gorges; Feihu is in Daijun; Juwang is in Yanmen, all narrow and treacherous defiles.

Thus, their bodies may dwell upon rivers and seas, yet their spirits wander beneath the towering gates of the royal court—*Weique* are the outer gates of the royal palace.

Thus the teachings of the symbolic images are displayed upon the *Xiangwei*—towering and vast. Called *Weique*, it signifies that though the perfected person may dwell in distant lands, their heart remains with the king. Another interpretation: the heart’s *Juque* is where the spirit inwardly guards. Without attaining the One Origin, who could reach such a state? The One Origin is the source of the Dao.

Therefore, dwelling with the utmost person causes families to forget poverty, kings and lords to set aside their wealth and nobility and delight in humility, the bold to temper their vigor, and the greedy to dissolve their desires. Seated, they do not instruct; standing, they do not debate. Empty, they go forth; full, they return. Thus, without speaking, they nourish others with harmony. The Dao’s instruction flows like a river, silently quenching thirst with harmonious ease.

The supreme Dao is non-action, now a dragon, now a serpent—dragons transform, serpents shed their skins, hence the Dao uses them as metaphors. Expanding and contracting, coiling and unfurling, it changes with the times. Outwardly, it follows the wind; inwardly, it preserves its nature. Eyes and ears do not dazzle; thoughts do not stray. *Stray* here means to wander. Those who abide in the spirit hold simplicity and roam the Great Clarity. *Hold* means to grasp; *simplicity* means vastness. They draw forth and elevate the ten thousand things, causing all virtues to sprout. *Draw forth* means to promote; *elevate* is read like *yun* in *yungong*. Thus, those who govern the spirit drive it away; *govern* means to manage. Those who rest the spirit cause it to reside. Without disturbance or agitation.

The Dao emerges from the One Origin, passes through the Nine Gates—the gates of heaven—and disperses along the Six Thoroughfares, spreading through the six directions. It is established in the boundless expanse, *established* meaning to extend. *Gaidian* are the limits of the horizon. *Gai* is read as when one’s food and drink are so abundant that thoughts turn downward. *Dian* is read like the *fan* in *Guan Shi’s fan dian*. Serene and empty, it is not active toward things, nor do things act upon it. *Not active toward things* means it does not act upon them; *things act upon it* means things act upon themselves.

Thus, when actions accord with the Dao, it is not that the Dao acts, but that the Dao extends. All that heaven covers, earth bears, the six directions encompass, yin and yang exhale, rain and dew moisten, and the Dao and virtue uphold—these all share one father and mother and are gathered into one harmony. *Father and mother* are heaven and earth; *gathered* means to assemble; *harmony* is qi, what the Dao values. *Exhale* is read like the *xu* in *xiang xu*.

Therefore, the scholar tree and the orange tree become brothers, for the Dao unites disparate things. The Youmiao and Sanwei become one family. The Youmiao were a southern state near Pengli, who resisted in the time of Shun. Sanwei is a mountain at the western extremity, in Chenzhou. Their union is the Dao’s transformation. Though the eye gazes at swans and geese and the ear listens to the zither’s sound, the heart may be in Yanmen. Within a single body, the spirit divides and scatters; within the six directions, a single movement spans a thousand miles.

Thus, viewed from their differences, liver and gallbladder are as distant as Hu and Yue—liver and gallbladder are near, Hu and Yue are far apart. Viewed from their sameness, the ten thousand things are one corner. *Corner* means a nook. The hundred schools diverge in their doctrines, each with its own origin. As for Mo, Yang, Shen, and Shang in relation to the governance of the Dao: Mo is Mo Di, whose methods embraced universal love, rejected music, and wore oneself from head to heel for the benefit of the state. Yang is Yang Zhu, whose methods preserved one’s nature and integrity, and who would not pluck a single hair from his shin to benefit the world. Shen is Shen Buhai, minister to the Marquis of Han, who composed the *Three Mandates* and favored harsh governance. Shang is Gongsun Yang of Wei, who for Duke Xiao of Qin established laws of mutual responsibility, known for their severity, and was enfeoffed as Lord of Shang, hence called Shang Yang.

They are like a canopy without a single rafter or a wheel without a single spoke: their presence may complete the number, but their absence does no harm to function. Yet each claims exclusive possession, failing to comprehend the nature of heaven and earth. Now, when a smith casts vessels, the metal leaps within the furnace, and there must be spillage and waste. Some congeal unevenly, taking on shapes resembling things. Though their forms may be somewhat complete, they cannot compare to the Nine Tripods of the Zhou. How much less can they match those shaped by the compass? They are far removed from the Dao.

Now, the branching and scattering of the ten thousand things, the stems and leaves of the hundred affairs—all arise from one root and extend into a thousand strands. *Scattering* means to spread; *stems* is read like *san* in *baoyou sanye*. Like this, they have a receiver but no giver. The receiver has no giver, yet nothing is not received. That nothing is not received is like the dense clouds of Zhou, gathering and amassing, swelling and surging, to become rain. *Zhou clouds* are thick rain clouds; *gathering* means to assemble. *Swelling and surging* describe accumulation. The rain soaks the ten thousand things yet does not share their wetness. It does not become wet with them.

Now, the skilled archer possesses the measures of sights and markers, just as the craftsman has the calculations of compass and square—these are what they attain to reach mastery. They attain the skill of sights, markers, compass, and square. Yet Xi Zhong cannot become Peng Meng. Xi Zhong was skilled in making chariots; Peng Meng was skilled in archery. This shows they cannot be combined. Zaofu cannot become Bo Le. Zaofu was skilled in driving horses and served King Mu of Zhou; Bo Le was skilled in judging horses and served Duke Mu of Qin. This illustrates mastery of one aspect but failure to comprehend the connections of ten thousand directions.

Now, when black dye soaks into silk, it becomes blacker than the dye; when indigo soaks into silk, it becomes bluer than the indigo. The silk is not the dye, nor is the blue the indigo. Though it meets its source, it can no longer revert. The dye is alum stone; the source is the origin. What does this show? It illustrates how transformation grows ever more distant. How much more so for that which has never been shaped by dye or indigo? Its transformations, though carved into metal and stone or written on bamboo and silk, cannot fully express their number. *Carved* is read like *lou* in *loushu*.

From this we see: all things are born from *having*. *Having* means abiding. Great and small flourish abundantly. This speaks of their abundance. The tip of an autumn hair, though it sinks into the spaceless, returns to the great. The autumn hair is subtle and wondrous, thus it enters the spaceless. *Spaceless* means aperture. This speaks of the formless Dao: though compared to the tip of a hair, it still becomes great. The thickness of a reed’s membrane, though it passes through the boundless, returns to the substantial. *Thickness* here means thinness. *Reed* is the rush. The white membrane within the reed stalk, when pared to its thinnest, reverts to the rush—thus it is said to return to the substantial. *Membrane* is read like *fu* in *mianfu*.

As for that which has no autumn hair’s subtlety, no reed membrane’s thinness, which extends in all four directions without boundary, passing through the limitless—where the Dao pervades the formless (for the autumn hair and reed membrane already have form), thus it is said: “no autumn hair’s subtlety, no reed membrane’s thinness, extending in all four directions without boundary, passing through the limitless.” *Limitless* is the same as *frontier*. Yet nothing can restrain, intercept, or obstruct it. Its subtle and profound mystery gives rise to the ten thousand things, shaping and transforming them like a ball of clay. Such is the power of the Dao. Between heaven and earth, how could this be fully discussed? This speaks of the greatness of the Dao’s transformations.

A fierce wind may uproot trees yet cannot pluck a single hair. *Pluck* also means *uproot*. On a cloud-reaching tower, those who fall break their spines and shatter their skulls, yet mosquitoes and gnats can soar unharmed. The tower’s height touches the clouds, hence it is called a cloud-reaching tower. Mosquitoes and gnats are minute, thus they soar without fear of injury or destruction—this is what the Dao values. Those who ride the celestial mechanism with the crawling and wriggling—*crawling* and *wriggling* illustrate the minute; *celestial mechanism* is the divine steed—even the lightest and most subtle of flying things can escape with their lives. How much more so for that which has no form? *Form* means shape. Having no shape is what the Dao esteems.

From this we see: the birth of form from the formless is clear. Therefore, the sage entrusts his spirit to the numinous storehouse and returns to the origin of the ten thousand things. He sees in the darkness and hears in the silence. Within the darkness, he alone perceives the dawn. *Dawn* means clarity. Within the stillness, he alone has illumination. He employs it by not employing it; only by not employing it can he truly employ it. He knows by not knowing; only by not knowing can he truly know.

If heaven were not stable, the sun and moon would have no path. *Path* means course. If earth were not stable, grasses and trees would have no place to stand. *Stand* means take root. If what is established in the self is not secure, right and wrong have no manifestation. *Manifestation* means appearance. Thus, only with the true person does true knowledge arise. Knowledge is not false, hence it is called true. What he holds is not evident—how could the foolish know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?

Now, those who accumulate kindness and heap up generosity, who layer love and pile on favor, using fame and splendor to envelop the common people, making them joyful and content in their natures—this is *ren*. Those who achieve great deeds, establish illustrious names, embody the relationship between ruler and minister, rectify high and low, clarify close and distant, rank noble and base, preserve endangered states, restore broken lineages, resolve entanglements and govern disorder, revive ruined clans, and establish heirs where there are none—this is *yi*. Those who close the nine apertures, conceal the heart and will, discard wisdom and intelligence, return to unknowing, wander aimlessly beyond the dust, and roam in the realm of no-affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang so that the ten thousand things harmonize—this is *de*.

Thus, the Dao scatters to become *de*, *de* overflows to become *ren* and *yi*. When *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and *de* are abandoned. A tree of a hundred spans, when felled and carved into a sacrificial vessel—*sacrificial* is read like *xi* in *xizun*, an intricately carved vessel—is engraved with patterns, adorned with blue and yellow, using tools like the *ji* (a hooked knife) and *ju* (a marking tool for carving). *Ji* is a skilled artisan’s carving knife; *ju* is the compass and square for marking and outlining. These are the tools for carving. Blue and yellow are decorative colors. *Ji* is read like *zhi* in *zhiji*; *ju* is read like *jue* in *juejiao*.

With splendid ornamentation and gleaming brilliance, dragons, snakes, tigers, and leopards curve into patterns. *Splendid ornamentation* means elaborate designs; *gleaming* refers to the vessel’s brightness. Dragons, snakes, tigers, and leopards are carved into the sacrificial vessels in coiling and crouching forms—hence it is said to curve into patterns. Yet when its fragments lie discarded in the ditch, compared to the sacrificial vessel, the difference in beauty is vast. *Vast* means distant. In their beauty and ugliness, they are far apart. Yet they have equally lost the nature of the wood. *Equally* means the same.

Thus, when the spirit scatters, words become flowery. *Scatters* means disperses.

Words fail to hold fast—thus they bloom with emptiness. *Virtue* scatters, and conduct becomes false. *Scatters* means to stray into deceit without fulfillment.

When the purest *qi* perishes within, yet speech and action are displayed without, this is to enslave the self to things—*to be enslaved by things.* Those who chase and abandon, who act with falsity, seek *qi* in externals. When *qi* dwindles to exhaustion while conduct knows no bounds, the heart is disturbed, the spirit muddied, and the root confounded.

What they cling to is unstable, *and* they stray into the winds of worldly custom. *Winds* means transformation. What they sever stumbles and falters, inwardly clouding their clarity. Thus they vacillate to the end, never attaining a moment of tranquility.

Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the *Dao* within and does not adorn the outside with benevolence and righteousness. They do not know the *proper* bounds of ears and eyes, *but* wander in the harmony of spirit and *qi.* Such is the sage’s wandering: below, they fathom the Three Springs; above, they traverse the Nine Heavens; horizontally, they embrace the Six Directions; they thread through the ten thousand things. This is the sage’s wandering.

As for the *zhenren*, they move dissolved in perfect emptiness and wander in the wilderness of annihilation. They ride *Feilian* and follow *Dunyu*—*Feilian* is a beast with long fur and wings; *Dunyu* is a small tiger, or the name of an immortal. They gallop beyond the bounds, resting within the cosmos. They illuminate the ten suns and command wind and rain, command *Leigong*, employ *Kua Fu*—*Kua Fu* was an immortal who cast aside his staff and became the Deng Forest. They take *Fufei* as concubine, wed *Shinü*, and how could heaven and earth suffice to confine their will?

Thus, emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the *Dao*; plainness and ease are the *Dao*’s essence. *Essence* means nature.

*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll Three, concludes.
*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll Four, recorded by Minister of the Grand Commandant, Xu Shen.

**The Lower "Initiating the Real"**

When people serve their spirits yet vex their essence, pursuing cleverness and seeking externally—all this is to lose their numinous clarity and abandon their true abode. *Serve* means to cultivate; *vex* means to trouble; *pursuing cleverness* refers to those who chase fame and profit. Thus it is said they seek externally. *Abandon their abode* means to forsake the dwelling of spirit and essence.

Therefore, the frozen borrow layered robes in spring, while the sweltering long for cool winds in autumn. Those afflicted within must show signs without. The *cen* tree bears a greenish film—*cen* is the bitter *li*, a tree by name. It grows in the mountains; its bark is stripped, soaked in water to yield a pure green, then used to wash the eyes, curing the membrane that clouds vision. Thus it is said to bear a greenish film. *Green* is the color, the sign. And the *luo* fly cures *wo huan*—*luo meng* is the slender horsefly; *wo huan* is an eye ailment. These are all remedies for the eyes. If one seeks such things without cause, they must have something obscuring their sight.

What startles the world about the sage, the perfected never deign to emulate. *Startles* means to move. What the worthy use to correct世俗, the sage never observes. *Correct* means to oppose. The puddle in a cow’s hoofprint holds no carp a foot long; *cen* is stagnant water. *Cen* is pronounced like *yan he*, with a sharp intake of breath. The mound of a clod bears no timber ten feet tall. This is a small hill in Chenliu. Why is this so? Because their dwelling is too narrow to contain anything great—how much less could that which has no enclosure do so? *No enclosure* means no form. This is how far the potential of mountains and abysses extends. Here, none debate greatness or magnitude.

When people are constrained by the world, their form is battered and their spirit leaks, so they cannot escape emptiness. *Form bound* means the body is afflicted and the spirit scatters, failing to remain in its proper guard. Thus it is said they cannot escape the illness of emptiness. If I can be tethered, it must be that my fate lies outside.

In the age of utmost virtue, one sweetly slumbers in the murky marshes—*yan* is read like *leisurely*. It describes the boundless and vacant. And one wanders in the vast expanse of the infinite. *Wanders* is like *boundless*. Without life, form arises; primordial *qi* is the root of spirit. Thus Lu Ao, meeting the *ruoshi*, said, "I have an appointment with the boundless at the summit of the nine heavens." *Abode* means dwelling. Lifting heaven and earth, one discards the myriad things, taking the primal chaos as a pillar of light, drifting and floating at the edge of no boundary. *Lifting* is with one hand; *na* means to raise; *discard* means to cast aside. This speaks of not allowing the self to be enslaved by things.

Primal chaos, the wilds of the eastern frontier, where the sun emerges—thus it is made the pillar of light. *Floating and drifting* is like soaring and roaming. *Without boundary or shore* describes its limitless expanse, hence the name.

Thus the sage inhales and exhales the *qi* of yin and yang, and all living beings gaze upward in reverence, their virtue harmonized in obedience. At this time, none preside over governance, yet separation and concealment resolve themselves, and all things come to be. Vast and boundless, primordial and undivided—*vast and boundless* describes the great form of chaos. Thus it is said: "primordial simplicity remains undispersed." All things merge as one, and the myriad beings flourish in abundance. *Flourish* means to thrive.

Therefore, even one with the wisdom of Yi would have no use for it. This speaks of the age of high antiquity, when one could sweetly slumber and governance would unfold of itself. Thus it is said: "even with the wisdom of Yi, there would be no use for it." This refers to Yi of Yao’s time, who could shoot down ten suns, ensnare the great wind, slay the *Yayu*, behead the nine-headed serpent, and shoot the River Lord—his cunning and skill were unmatched. It does not refer to Hou Yi of the Youqiong clan.

As the world declined, even under Fuxi, the Dao grew dim and indistinct. Yet he chanted of virtue and embraced harmony. Fuxi ruled all under heaven by the power of wood, and was called the Great Bright One. *Dim* means pure and thick; *indistinct* describes its vastness. He chanted of virtue and embraced harmony, though his *qi* had not yet fully spread. His influence was far-reaching—*far-reaching* is read as the *bi* in "illuminating the four directions." His virtue and grace were powerfully bestowed upon the people, and thus knowledge began to stir.

Dim and obscure, all sought to cast off their childlike innocence. *Dim* means desiring clarity but not yet attaining it; *obscure* describes the state of seeking knowledge. *Cast off* means to depart. And they awakened to observe the space between heaven and earth. Thus their virtue grew disordered and could not be unified. *Disordered* means excessive; *unified* means aligned.

By the time of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, the great origin was divided, and the principles of heaven and earth were penetrated. They followed the nine heavens and doubled the nine forms—*penetrated* means to connect; *principles* means to order. *Followed* means to adhere to; *forms* refers to structure. This speaks of adhering to the forms and laws of the nine heavens and nine earths to establish order. They grasped yin and yang, harmonized hardness and softness, branched and resolved, threaded and arranged the ten thousand things and the hundred clans. *Harmonized* means to blend; *clans* means categories. They ensured each had its proper sequence and position. *Position* means place.

At this, the people gazed in wide-eyed wonder, yet none failed to stand in awe and lend their ears and eyes. *Gazing in wide-eyed wonder* describes their attentive listening and watching. Thus governance was achieved, but harmony was not. *Harmony* means accord.

From the decline of the Xia to the age of Kunwu and the Xia Hou clan—Kunwu was a lord of Xia in the time of Jie—desires became entangled with things, and keen perception was lured outward, so that nature and destiny lost their proper attainment. *Nature* is the root of destiny.

By the decline of the Zhou, purity thinned and simplicity scattered—*scattered* is read as the *yi* in "difficult and easy." The Dao was adulterated with falsity, and virtue was practiced with restraint. *Adulterated* means mixed. And cunning and deceit began to sprout. *Cunning* refers to deceptive speech.

As the Zhou declined and the royal Dao was abandoned, the Confucians and Mohists began to array their teachings and debate, dividing into factions and disputing. *Confucians* refers to the Dao of Confucius; *Mohists* to the techniques of Mo Di. *Factions* means parties; *disputing* means contesting right and wrong.

Thus they amassed learning to cast doubt upon the sages, and embellished falsehoods to coerce the masses. They studied the ways of Yang Zhu and Mo Di to sow doubt in the teachings of Confucius. They fabricated flowery words to slander the sages and intimidate their followers. They strummed strings, sang, danced, and adorned the *Odes* and *Documents* to purchase fame and reputation in the world. *Purchase* means to seek.

They multiplied the rites of ascent and descent, adorned their robes and caps, gathered crowds insufficient to exhaust their variations, and amassed wealth insufficient to meet their expenses. Thus the people began to swell with restless ambition, each desiring to deploy their cunning and deceit to carve a niche in the world, and to select and pursue fame and profit. *Deploy* means to apply; *select* means to choose; *pursue* means to seek. This speaks of applying their craft and seeking glory and gain.

Thus the common people sprawled across the fields of excess and dissipation, losing the root of the great origin. *Fields* may also be written as *wilds*.

The loss of nature and destiny in the world arises from gradual decline, and its origins are long-standing. Thus the learning of the sage aims to return nature to its beginning and to wander the mind in emptiness. Humans receive the center of heaven and earth at birth—Mencius said: "Nature is without flaw, but emotions and desires harm it." Thus the sage can return nature to its beginning. *Wandering the mind in emptiness* means to be without desire.

The learning of the enlightened aims to extend nature to the farthest reaches and to awaken to stillness and desolation. But the learning of the vulgar world is not so. They pluck at virtue and *xiao* their nature, inwardly distressing the five organs and outwardly exhausting their ears and eyes. *Pluck* means to seize; *xiao* means to strip. Neither follows principle, thus their thoughts are troubled. Their ears listen recklessly, their eyes gaze recklessly—excess leads to exhaustion.

They begin by grasping at the finest details of things, shaking and sweeping away benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. They violently display their cunning and intelligence in the world to summon fame and reputation. *Shaking and sweeping away* means they cannot practice benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. *Violently* means suddenly; *display* means to flaunt. They flaunt their deceitful intelligence to seize fame and reputation. This is what I find shameful and will not do.

Thus, rather than possess all under heaven, it is better to possess joy. *Joy* means delight—better to have others delight in you. Rather than possess joy, it is better to wander the beginnings and ends of things, and to comprehend the boundaries between being and non-being.

Therefore, though the whole world praises me, I am not encouraged; though the whole world blames me, I am not deterred.

Establishing oneself at the boundary between life and death, one penetrates the principle of honor and disgrace. Though raging fires and vast floods spread across the world, the spirit suffers no loss or lack within the breast. Such a one regards all under heaven as but a floating feather or drifting mustard seed—*mustard seed* meaning the center. Who would willingly divide their attention, *divided* denoting the appearance of scattered thoughts, to make external things their concern?

The nature of water is truly clear, yet soil muddies it; the nature of man is tranquil, yet cravings and desires disturb it. What humans receive from heaven—the ears and eyes for sounds and sights, the mouth and nose for fragrances and odors, the skin for cold and warmth—all share the same essence. Yet some attain communion with spirit and illumination, while others fall into delusion and madness—why? The constraints they impose differ.

Thus, spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the abyss is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level. No one gazes at their reflection in flowing foam, but rather in still water, for its tranquility. *Foam* refers to the froth stirred up by rain, obscuring the vessel and rendering the human form unseen. No one peers at their form in unpolished iron, but rather in a bright mirror, for its clarity—*clarity* as in the *Changes* of Hejian. Only through clarity and stillness can one perceive the nature of things. From this, we see that utility must borrow from what is not used.

Therefore, an empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness comes to rest. *Empty* refers to the heart; *chamber* to the body; *brightness* to the Dao. By emptying the heart to generate the Dao, the nature of the Dao is desireless, and auspiciousness comes to dwell. A clear mirror cannot be obscured by dust and grime—*obscured* meaning defiled, pronounced like the *wo* in the Wo dialect. A pure spirit cannot be disordered by cravings and desires. A pure spirit guards the essence within, and the passions of craving and desire cannot disturb or confuse it.

When the spirit scatters outward, one must return and govern it—*scatters* meaning disperses; *govern* meaning to regulate. This is to lose the root and seek it in the branches. When inner and outer fail to correspond and one desires to engage with things, exhausting their mysterious radiance while seeking knowledge through the ears and eyes—*mysterious radiance* being inner illumination, also called the *Mysterious*, the Heavenly—this is to abandon the luminous and pursue the obscure. This is called losing the Dao.

When the heart reaches a certain point, the spirit sighs in response. Returning to emptiness, all dissipation and disturbance vanish—this is the wandering of the sage. Returning to emptiness, the nature of craving and desire dissipates and vanishes; thus it is called the wandering of the sage. *Wandering* means to act.

Therefore, those of old who governed all under heaven first penetrated the conditions of nature and destiny. Their actions were not necessarily the same, yet their alignment with the Dao was one. One does not don fur in summer not out of frugality, but because warmth suffices. One does not use a fan in winter not out of disdain, but because coolness suffices—*fan* pronounced like the *sha* in the quacking of a goose; *disdain* meaning to belittle.

The sage measures their belly to eat, gauges their form to clothe, and regulates only themselves. How could greed and corruption arise? Thus, one who can possess all under heaven must not treat it as a possession; one who can possess fame and reputation must not seek it through contrived conduct—*treat* meaning to employ. The sage attains a certain understanding, and with that attainment, the heart of craving and desire is cast aside—*cast aside* meaning discarded.

The disciples of Confucius and Mozi all taught the arts of benevolence and righteousness to the world, yet they could not avoid rendering themselves useless, let alone practice what they preached—*rendering themselves useless* meaning their persons went unutilized; *useless* pronounced like the *lei* in "echoing thunder." Why is this? Their Dao was external.

To seek the root through its branches—even Xu You could not practice this, let alone the common people? *Common people* refers to the ordinary folk, those leveled with the masses. Truly comprehending the essence of one’s nature and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere; what need is there for deliberate pursuit or rejection to disturb the heart?

When the spirit remains unobscured and the mind bears no burden, all flows freely and unimpeded, serene and untroubled. With nothing congealed or stagnant, one abides in emptiness and stillness, awaiting all things. Then, neither power nor profit can entice—*entice* meaning to delude or lure. Sophists cannot persuade—*persuade* meaning to dispel. Sensual pleasures cannot seduce, beauty cannot lead astray—*lead astray* meaning to covet or overindulge. The wise cannot sway, the brave cannot frighten. This is the Dao of the perfected person.

One who embodies this tempers and cools the myriad things, serving as the companion of the Creator. Between heaven and earth, within the cosmos, nothing can obstruct or restrain. That which engenders life does not die, while that which transforms things does not itself transform—*that which engenders life* refers to heaven; *that which transforms things* refers to virtue. Though traversing the Li Mountains and Mount Taihang, it meets no difficulty. Though entering the Four Seas and the Nine Rivers, it does not become drenched. Dwelling in narrow confines, it is not constricted; spanning the expanse between heaven and earth, it does not yawn—*spanning* meaning to enclose.

One who fails to comprehend this—though their eyes may count the thousands in a flock of sheep, their ears discern the harmonies of the eight winds (the winds of the eight trigrams, *feng* meaning harmony), though their feet tread the dances of Yang’e and their hands keep time with the rhythms of *Green Waters* (*Yang’e* being a renowned performer of antiquity; *Green Waters*, a dance melody—or, by another account, an ancient poem; *qu* meaning to follow the beat)—though their wisdom spans heaven and earth, their illumination rivals sun and moon, their eloquence unravels linked rings, and their beneficence moistens jade and stone, it is still of no avail in governing the world.

Stillness and tranquility nurture one’s nature; harmony, joy, and emptiness nurture one’s virtue. When the external does not disturb the internal, one’s nature finds its proper place; when nature remains unagitated and harmonious, one’s virtue rests securely in its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to live out one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.

Those who attain this have blood and qi free from stagnation, the five viscera free from pathogenic qi (*wei* meaning illness). Neither fortune nor misfortune can unsettle them, neither praise nor blame can defile them, and thus they reach the ultimate. *Ultimate* meaning the highest point. Yet without the right era, who can bring it to fruition? Even one who possesses such ability, if they do not encounter the right time, may not even free themselves—how much less so one without the Dao, whose Way cannot be put into practice?

Now, human nature is such that the ears and eyes respond to stimuli, the heart and mind know sorrow and joy, and the hands and feet—shielding from cold and heat—engage with the world. A bee or scorpion stings a finger, and the spirit cannot remain composed (*shi* read as *release*; *dan* meaning settled). A mosquito or horsefly bites the skin, and the mind cannot stay at peace (*zan* meaning to bite, like piercing). The onset of cares and troubles assails the human heart (*ying* meaning to press upon)—not merely the venom of bees and scorpions or the torment of mosquitoes and horseflies. How, then, can one hope to remain in stillness, emptiness, and tranquility?

The eye may discern the tip of an autumn hair, yet fail to hear the crash of thunder; the ear may attune to the sound of jade and stone, yet fail to see the height of Mount Tai. Why? Because the small occupies the mind, and the great is forgotten.

Now, the myriad things assail us, plucking at our understanding, seizing our emotions like a spring’s unceasing flow. Even if one wished not to be moved, how could it be possible? *Bing* meaning to be stirred into action.

Consider a tree: watered with fresh streams, nurtured in fertile soil (*chou* meaning to heap; *rang* may also be written as *liao*), tended by one person yet uprooted by ten—it will surely leave no sprouts (*nie* meaning shoots). How much more so when an entire state joins in the uprooting? Though one may wish for long life, how can it be attained?

A basin of water in the courtyard, though cleared all day, cannot reflect one’s brows and lashes; yet a single stir renders it too turbid to discern a square or circle. *Cha* meaning to perceive. The human spirit is easily muddied and difficult to clarify—like the basin of water. How, then, can one hope for even a moment’s peace when the world stirs and unsettles it?

In the age of utmost virtue, merchants thrived in their markets, farmers delighted in their work, ministers rested in their duties (*zhi* meaning affairs), and recluses cultivated their Way (the Way of the former kings). In that time, wind and rain did not break or uproot, plants and trees did not wither prematurely, the Nine Tripods bore rich patina, pearls and jade gleamed with luster (*Nine Tripods* cast from the tribute metal of the nine provinces—or, by another account, symbolizing the nine virtues; *zhong* meaning thick; *runze* meaning radiant). The Luo River yielded its cinnabar script, the Yellow River its green diagrams. Thus, Xu You, Fang Hui, Shan Juan, and Pi Yi were able to realize their Way (*Xu You* of Yangcheng, whom Yao sought but who declined; *Fang Hui*, *Shan Juan*, and *Pi Yi*, all recluses of Yao’s time whose names cannot now be known—*Fang Hui* named for his upright and circling demeanor, *Pi Yi* for his habit of going about in a draped robe). They attained joy in what they cultivated—the Way of the former kings. Why was this so?

When rulers of an age possess the intent to benefit all under heaven, the people are thus able to find joy within it—joy in their own Way amid heaven and earth. Some cultivate civil virtue and take delight in their midst, which is the Way of the former kings. The talents of the Four Masters were not wholly perfect, for they belonged to the present age; yet none could share their radiance, for they met with the era of Tang and Yu.

*Radiance* here means *renown*.

But when the time of Jie of Xia and Zhou of Yin arrived, they burned living men, executed those who offered remonstrance, devised the roasting pillar, and cast the bronze column—setting fire beneath it and placing men atop it, laughing as they fell into the flames. They carved out the hearts of worthy men and split the shins of talented scholars.

*The worthy man* refers to Bi Gan.
*Split* means *to dissect*.
They flayed and examined the legs of gifted scholars to see if they possessed any marvels.
*Shin* here means *leg*.

They minced the daughter of the Ghost Marquis into meat paste and pickled the bones of Mei Bo.

The Ghost Marquis and Mei Bo were feudal lords of Zhou’s time. Mei Bo had praised the beauty of the Ghost Marquis’s daughter, prompting Zhou to take her as a consort. When she arrived, Zhou found her unpleasing and thus minced the daughter of the Ghost Marquis and pickled the bones of Mei Bo.
Another account states that Zhou, being without the Way, had Mei Bo repeatedly admonish him, so he pickled his bones.

At that time, Mount Yao collapsed, and the Three Rivers ran dry.

Mount Yao is said to lie in Nanyang.
The Three Rivers are the Jing, Wei, and Qian.
*Dry* means *exhausted*.

The tradition states: “When mountains collapse and rivers run dry, it is an omen of a state’s demise.”

Birds singed their wings in flight, and beasts broke their legs in haste. This speaks of Zhou’s ceaseless hunting and indulgence in game, so that flying birds snapped their wings and running beasts shattered their limbs—none escaped harm.

At such a time, how could there have been no sages? Yet they could not make their Way prevail, for they did not meet with their era. This means that sages could not bring their Way to fruition or enact their will because they did not encounter the right age.

When birds soar a thousand fathoms high and beasts run through dense thickets, disaster still befalls them—how much more so for the common folk bound to their households?

*Thicket* refers to a cluster of trees; *dense growth* to deep grass. *Still befalls them* refers to untimely hunting.

From this we see that embodying the Way does not depend solely on oneself; it may also be struck down by the age.

Consider the city of Liyang, which in a single night turned into a lake. The strong and wise shared the same fate as the weary and cowardly.

Liyang was a county in the state of Huainan, now part of Jiangdu.

Long ago, an old woman there constantly practiced benevolence and righteousness. Two scholars passed by and told her: “This land is fated to sink into a lake. When you see blood at the threshold of the eastern gate, flee at once to the northern mountain—do not look back.” From then on, the woman went to check the gate’s threshold. The gatekeeper asked her why, and she told him what had been said. That evening, the gatekeeper deliberately smeared chicken blood on the threshold. The next morning, the old woman hurried to the gate, saw the blood, and fled to the northern mountain. The land sank into a lake. When she spoke of this to the gatekeeper, barely a night had passed—yet by dawn, the city had become a lake. The brave and the cowardly met the same fate, with none escaping.

Atop Mount Wu, fire set with the wind spreads—fat summer trees and purple mushrooms perish alongside mugwort and wormwood. Mount Wu lies in Nan Commandery. "Fat summer" refers to great trees, their grain dense and white as lard, hence the name. Purple mushrooms symbolize the wise and virtuous; mugwort and wormwood, lowly weeds, symbolize the unworthy. Thus, fish of the Yellow River cannot see clearly, and young crops cannot ripen in season—such is the nature of their birth. The river’s waters are turbid, so their eyes cannot see; young crops wither under frost, so they cannot await their natural ripening. Thus it is said: such is the nature of their birth.

When the world is well-ordered, the foolish cannot alone cause chaos; when the world is in turmoil, the wise cannot alone bring order. To stride through a corrupt age and demand the Dao not be obstructed is like hobbling a fine steed with double fetters and expecting it to gallop a thousand *li*. To place an ape in a cage is to make it no different from a pig—not because it lacks skill or agility, but because it has no scope to exercise its abilities. When Shun tilled the soil and fired pottery, he could not bring prosperity to his village. Yet when he ruled as king, his virtue extended to the four seas. It is not that benevolence itself increased, but that his position afforded advantage and influence.

The sages of old were harmonious, joyful, and serene by nature; their aspirations fulfilled and the Dao realized by fate. Only when nature meets fate can action proceed; only when fate aligns with nature can clarity arise. A bow of *niao-hao* wood and a crossbow of *Xizi* make cannot shoot without their strings. *Niao-hao* refers to *zhe* mulberry; *Xizi* is either the name of a state producing crossbows or a skilled crossbow artisan from Yangzheng. A Yue skiff or a Shu raft cannot float without water. Though the people of Yue are accustomed to boats, without water, they cannot sail alone. Now, with snares and arrows poised above and nets spread below, how can one hope to soar? *Zeng* are short arrows for shooting birds; *ji* refers to their release. To soar is to fly high, wings rising and falling; to glide is to hold steady in the air.

Thus the *Odes* say:
*Plucking, plucking the* juan’er,
*Not filling even a shallow basket—*
*Alas, I long for that man,*
*Placed upon the royal road.*

This speaks of yearning for the distant past. The verse is from the *Juan’er* poem in the *Zhou Nan* section of the *Odes*. It describes how easily gathered greens fail to fill even a small vessel, just as a ruler who does not focus his heart cannot fulfill the Dao—like plucking common herbs yet failing to fill a simple basket. *"Alas, I long for that man, placed upon the royal road"* means: I think of the ancient worthy, appointing the virtuous to office, placing them in their rightful ranks. Truly, when the worthy of old each found their proper place, it is said one yearns for that distant time.

*Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll Four, concludes.

**Huainan Honglie Jie, Scroll Five**

*Recorded by Minister of the Grand Commandant and Libationer Xu Shen*

**Heavenly Patterns, Part One**

"Pattern" (*wen*) means "image." All refer to the celestial omens sent down to admonish the world—sun, moon, five planets, comets, and broom stars—unified in one, hence called "Heavenly Patterns." Thus the chapter is titled.

Before Heaven fell into form, it was *fengfeng yiyi*, *dongdong zhuzhu*—thus called "Great Clarity." *Fengyi* and *dongzhu* describe the formless. *Dong* is read as the *tong* in *tingtong* (paulownia); *zhu* is read as the sound of an iron head striking the earth.

The Dao began in the Void (*xukuo*). The Void gave birth to Space-Time (*yuzhou*). Space-Time gave birth to *qi*. *Qi* possessed boundaries and layers. *Yu* encompasses the four directions and above and below. *Zhou* spans past and present. This describes the formation of Heaven and Earth. *Hanyin* depicts layered stability.

The pure and light ascended, dispersing to become Heaven—*bomi* resembling drifting dust. The heavy and turbid congealed to become Earth. The union of the subtle and refined was singular in purpose. Yet the congealing of the heavy and turbid was difficult, so Heaven formed first, and Earth stabilized later.

The essence of Heaven and Earth intermingled to form *yin* and *yang*. *Xi*, union; *jing*, *qi*. The concentrated essence of *yin* and *yang* produced the four seasons. The dispersed essence of the four seasons gave rise to the myriad things.

Accumulated *yang*’s hot *qi* generated fire; the essence of fire’s *qi* became the sun. Accumulated *yin*’s cold *qi* became water; the essence of water’s *qi* became the moon. The excess essence of the sun and moon formed the stars. Heaven received the sun, moon, and stars; Earth received water, floods, and dust.

In ancient times, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne. Enraged, he struck Mount Buzhou. Gonggong was an official title, held by Boyu during the era between Fuxi and Shennong. His descendants, relying on cunning and punishment, grew strong, thus contending with Zhuanxu, grandson of the Yellow Emperor, for the throne. Mount Buzhou lies in the northwest.

The pillar of Heaven broke; Earth’s cords snapped. Heaven tilted to the northwest, so the sun, moon, and stars shifted there. *Qing* means "high." The *Yuandao* states: "Earth tilts to the southeast." Here, *qing* means "low." First mentioning the northwest’s tilt clarifies its height. Earth does not fill the southeast, so water, floods, and dust gather there.

Heaven’s Dao is round; Earth’s Dao is square. The square governs the obscure; the round governs the bright. The bright exhales *qi*—thus fire is called "outer radiance." The obscure contains *qi*—thus water is called "inner radiance." The exhaling *qi* bestows; the containing *qi* transforms. Therefore, *yang* bestows and *yin* transforms.

Heaven’s partial *qi*, when angered, becomes wind. The harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth becomes rain. *Yin* and *yang* press upon each other, stirring to become thunder. *Bo*, pressing; *gan*, movement. When agitated, it becomes lightning; when chaotic, it becomes fog. When *yang* *qi* prevails, it scatters into rain and dew. *San*, dispersal like mist. When *yin* *qi* prevails, it congeals into frost and snow.

Creatures with fur and feathers, which fly and move, belong to *yang*. Those with shells and scales, which hibernate, belong to *yin*. The sun is the lord of *yang*. Thus, in spring and summer, beasts shed their fur—*chu*, the winter coat thinning and falling. At the solstice, elk shed their antlers. At the winter solstice, elk antlers fall; at the summer solstice, deer antlers fall.

The moon is the ancestor of *yin*. Thus, when the moon wanes, fish brains diminish; when the moon dies, conch shells and clams shrink. *Zong*, root; *jian*, lessening. The flesh does not fill, reflecting *yin* *qi*. *Jiao* is read as the *jiao* in *wujiao miao* (steeped in wonder).

Fire rises; water flows downward. Thus, birds fly high, and fish move low. Creatures influence one another, their roots and branches responding. *Xun* is read as the *tan* in *getan* (kudzu vine); *biao* is read as the *mo* in *daomo* (knife’s tip).

Thus, the *yang* mirror (*yang sui*) catches the sun and ignites to produce fire. The *yang sui* is metal. Take an unrimmed metal cup, polish it until hot, hold it beneath the sun at noon, and place mugwort beneath it to catch the flame. The *fang zhu* catches the moon and exudes water. The *fang zhu* is a *yin* mirror, a large clam. Polish it until hot, face it toward the full moon, and water will form. Receive it with a bronze basin, and several drops will fall—so the masters taught.

When the tiger roars, the valley wind arrives. The tiger is an earthly creature; wind is the wood wind. Wood is born of earth, so when the tiger roars, the valley wind comes. When the dragon rises, auspicious clouds gather. The dragon is water; clouds are born of water, so when the dragon rises, auspicious clouds assemble. *Shu*, gathering.

When qilin fight, the sun and moon eclipse. When whales die, comets appear. When silkworms spin silk, the *shang* strings break. When silkworms age, their silk forms from within to without, appearing like golden essence *ya* inside and out—hence called *ya* silk. Another says: playing with silk in the mouth, the *shang* note is clear, the strings fine and taut, so they break first. When the *ben* star falls, the Bohai Sea overflows. The *ben* star is a guest star, also called a broom star. *Zhui*, falling; *bo*, great; *jue*, overflowing.

The ruler’s emotions ascend to communicate with Heaven. Thus, executing the cruel brings many whirlwinds. *Bao*, tyranny; *piaofeng*, swift winds. Distorting laws and decrees brings many insects and borers. *Ming* are those that eat the heart—grain’s calamity. Killing the innocent turns the land red. *Chidi*, drought. Failing to enforce decrees brings excessive rain. When timely decrees are not heeded, prolonged rain becomes a disaster.

The four seasons are Heaven’s officials; the sun and moon are Heaven’s messengers; the stars are Heaven’s markers. *Qi*, gathering. Rainbows, rainbows, and comets are Heaven’s taboos. The male is the rainbow; the female is the secondary rainbow.

The rainbow is of mixed colors. *Ji* means prohibition. Heaven has nine regions, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine corners, extending five hundred million *li* from the earth. The nine regions are the wilds of the nine heavens. Each region has one thousand one hundred and eleven corners.

The five stars, eight winds, and twenty-eight constellations: the five stars are Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury. The eight winds are the winds of the eight trigrams. The twenty-eight constellations are: in the east, Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket; in the north, Dipper, Ox, Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, Encampment, and Wall; in the west, Straddler, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, and Orion; in the south, Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Axletree.

The five officials and six treasuries: the five officials are the officials of the five phases. The six treasuries include grain. The Purple Palace, Supreme Subtlety, Xuan Yuan, Pool of Harmony, Four Guards, and Celestial River—all are names of stars, explained below.

What are the nine regions? The center is called the Equalizing Heaven; its stars are Horn, Neck, and Root. This is the division of Han and Zheng. The east is called the Azure Heaven; its stars are Chamber, Heart, and Tail. The northeast is called the Changing Heaven, where yang *qi* begins to stir and the myriad things sprout, hence the name Changing Heaven. Its stars are Winnowing Basket, Dipper, and Ox-Leader. Tail and Winnowing Basket are also called Broken Tree, the division of Yan. The Dipper is the division of Wu. Ox-Leader, also called Star Mark, is the division of Yue.

The north is called the Dark Heaven; its stars are Weaving Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, and Encampment. Emptiness and Rooftop are also called Dark Hollow, the division of Qi. The northwest is called the Dim Heaven; *you* means yin. In late autumn, the west approaches yin, hence the name Dim Heaven. Its stars are Eastern Wall, Straddler, and Stomach. Encampment and Eastern Wall are also called Receiving Grain, the division of Wei. Straddler and Stomach are also called Descending Grain, the division of Lu.

The west is called the Bright Heaven; *hao* means white. The west is metal, its color white, hence the name Bright Heaven. Some write it as *Wu*. Its stars are Stomach, Pleiades, and Net. Pleiades and Net are also called Great Bridge, the division of Zhao. The southwest is called the Vermilion Heaven; *zhu* means yang. The southwest is lesser yang, hence the name Vermilion Heaven. Its stars are Turtle Beak, Orion, and Eastern Well. Turtle Beak and Orion are also called True Sinking, the division of Jin.

The south is called the Blazing Heaven; its stars are Ghost Chariot, Willow, and Seven Stars. Willow, Seven Stars, and Spread are the division of Zhou, also called Quail Fire. The southeast is called the Yang Heaven; the southeast is pure *qian* in action, hence the name Yang Heaven. Its stars are Spread, Wings, and Axletree. Wings and Axletree are also called Quail Tail, the division of Chu.

What are the five stars? The east is wood; its emperor is Tai Hao. Tai Hao is the posthumous title of Fu Xi, who ruled all under Heaven; after death, he was enshrined as the emperor of the east. His assistant is Gou Mang, who holds the jade tablet and governs spring. His spirit is Jupiter, his beast the Azure Dragon, his note *jiao*, and his days *jia* and *yi*. Wood’s color is azure, and the Azure Dragon accords with this color. *Jiao* is wood. *Jia* and *yi* are both wood.

The south is fire; its emperor is the Flame Emperor. The Flame Emperor is the son of Shao Dian. He ruled all under Heaven by the virtue of fire and was called Shen Nong; after death, he was enshrined as the emperor of the south. His assistant is Zhu Ming—according to old accounts, Zhu Rong—who holds the balance and governs summer. His spirit is Mars, his beast the Vermilion Bird. Mars is one of the five stars; the Vermilion Bird is the Vermilion Sparrow. His note is *zhi*, and his days are *bing* and *ding*. *Zhi* is fire. *Bing* and *ding* are both fire.

The center is earth; its emperor is the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor is the son of Shao Dian. He ruled all under Heaven by the virtue of earth and was called Xuan Yuan; after death, he was enshrined as the emperor of the center. His assistant is Hou Tu, who holds the measuring line and regulates the four directions. His spirit is Saturn, his beast the Yellow Dragon—earth’s color is yellow. His note is *gong*, and his days are *wu* and *ji*. *Gong* is earth. *Wu* and *ji* are both earth.

The west is metal; its emperor is Shao Hao. Shao Hao is the son of the Yellow Emperor, Qing Yang. He ruled by the virtue of metal and was called Jin Tian; after death, he was enshrined as the emperor of the west. His assistant is Ru Shou, who holds the carpenter’s square and governs autumn. His spirit is Venus, his beast the White Tiger, his note *shang*, and his days *geng* and *xin*. *Shang* is metal. *Geng* and *xin* are both metal.

The north is water; its emperor is Zhuan Xu. Zhuan Xu is the grandson of the Yellow Emperor. He ruled all under Heaven by the virtue of water and was called Gao Yang; after death, he was enshrined as the emperor of the north. His assistant is Xuan Ming, who holds the scales and governs winter. His spirit is Mercury, his beast the Dark Warrior, his note *yu*, and his days *ren* and *gui*. *Yu* is water. *Ren* and *gui* are both water.

When the Great Yin is in the four midpoints, Jupiter moves through three lodges. *Zhong* means center; the four centers refer to the Great Yin being in the middle of the four directions: *mao*, *you*, *zi*, and *wu*. When the Great Yin is in the four hooks, Jupiter moves through two lodges. *Chou* hooks *chen*, *shen* hooks *si*, *yin* hooks *hai*, and *wei* hooks *xu*—this refers to the Great Yin being in the four corners. Two times eight is sixteen; three times four is twelve. Thus, in twelve years, it traverses the twenty-eight constellations. The moon moves one-twelfth of a degree per day, and in a year, it moves thirty degrees and seven-sixteenths of a degree. In twelve years, it completes a cycle. *Zhou* means complete.

Mars typically enters the Supreme Subtlety in the tenth month, receives its mandate, and moves through the constellations. It oversees the lawless states, bringing chaos, banditry, illness, mourning, famine, and war. It appears and disappears unpredictably, altering its color, sometimes visible, sometimes hidden.

These are all means by which the heavens admonish the ruler. When Saturn begins its cycle on *jiayin*, it establishes the Dipper; each year, it moves to guard one lodge. If it should reside in a lodge but does not, that state will lose territory. If it resides where it should not, that state will gain land, and the year will be bountiful. It moves one twenty-eighth of a degree per day, thirteen and five one-hundred-twelfths degrees per year, completing a cycle in eighteen years. Saturn’s course is partial.

Venus begins its cycle on the *jiayin* of the first month, emerging in the east at dawn with Mars, remaining visible for 240 days before entering. After 120 days of concealment, it reappears in the west at dusk for 240 days before entering again. After 35 days, it re-emerges in the east. It rises at *chen* and *xu*, and sets at *chou* and *wei*. If it fails to appear when it should, or enters when it should not, the world will lay down its arms. If it fails to enter when it should, or fails to emerge when it should, the world will raise its armies.

Mercury governs the four seasons: at the spring equinox in the second month, it appears near *Kui* and *Lou*; at the summer solstice in the fifth month, near *Dongjing* and *Yugui*; at the autumn equinox in the eighth month, near *Jiao* and *Kang*; and at the winter solstice in the eleventh month, near *Dou* and *Qianniu*. *Xiao* means "appearance." It rises at *chen* and *xu*, and sets at *chou* and *wei*, remaining visible for two ten-day periods. It is observed at dawn in the east and at dusk in the west. If it fails to appear for one season, that season will be unbalanced; if it fails to appear for all four seasons, the world will suffer great famine. A failure of the grain harvest is called famine.

What are the Eight Winds? Forty-five days after the winter solstice, the *Tiaofeng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Gen* trigram, also called *Rong*, associated with the *sheng* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Tiaofeng*, the *Mingshu Feng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Zhen* trigram, associated with the *guan* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Mingshu Feng*, the *Qingming Feng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Xun* trigram, associated with the *zhu* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Qingming Feng*, the *Jingfeng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Li* trigram, associated with the *xian* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Jingfeng*, the *Liangfeng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Kun* trigram, associated with the *xun* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Liangfeng*, the *Changhe Feng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Dui* trigram, associated with the *zhong* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Changhe Feng*, the *Buzhou Feng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Qian* trigram, associated with the *qing* instrument. Forty-five days after the *Buzhou Feng*, the *Guangmo Feng* arrives—this is the wind of the *Kan* trigram, associated with the *gu* instrument.

When the *Tiaofeng* arrives, light prisoners are released, and delayed cases are resolved—this occurs at *Lichun*, the beginning of spring, hence the release of light prisoners. When the *Mingshu Feng* arrives, borders are demarcated, and fields are cultivated—this occurs at the spring equinox, when grain is sown, hence the regulation of borders and the tilling of fields. When the *Qingming Feng* arrives, gifts of silk and coin are sent to enfeoff the feudal lords—this occurs at *Lixia*, the beginning of summer, when virtue is extended, hence the dispatch of gifts to the lords. When the *Jingfeng* arrives, ranks are conferred upon the worthy, and the meritorious are rewarded—this occurs at the summer solstice, when yin qi lies below and yang qi flourishes above, symbolizing the distribution of yang, hence the rewarding of the meritorious and the enfeoffment of lords. When the *Liangfeng* arrives, the virtue of the earth is repaid, and the four suburbs are sacrificed to—this occurs at *Liqiu*, the beginning of autumn, when the grain harvest is celebrated, hence the repayment of the earth’s virtue and the sacrifice to the gods of the four directions. When the *Changhe Feng* arrives, suspended bells and chimes are taken down, and lutes and zithers are not strung—this occurs at the autumn equinox, when the killing qi arises, and the ruler mourns, hence the removal of the music of bells, chimes, and suspended instruments. When the *Buzhou Feng* arrives, palaces and halls are repaired, and border walls are fortified—this occurs at *Lidong*, the beginning of winter, when earthworks commence, hence the repair of palaces and the fortification of border walls to prepare against banditry and calamity. When the *Guangmo Feng* arrives, passes and bridges are closed, and legal punishments are decided—this reflects the closure of the year in winter, when passes and bridges are not traversed. For doubtful cases of punishment, decisions are made in accordance with the season.

What are the Five Offices? The east is the Office of Fields, the south is the Office of the Minister of War, the west is the Office of Justice, the north is the Office of Public Works, and the center is the Capital. The Office of Fields oversees agriculture, the Office of the Minister of War oversees the military, the Office of Justice oversees prisons, the Office of Public Works oversees land, and the Capital is the foremost of the four directions.

What are the Six Treasuries? They are *zi-wu*, *chou-wei*, *yin-shen*, *mao-you*, *chen-xu*, and *si-hai*. The Supreme Subtlety is the court of the Great One. The Supreme Subtlety is a star, and the Great One is a celestial deity. The Purple Palace is the dwelling of the Great One. The Xuanyuan is the abode of the Emperor’s consorts. The Xianchi is the preserve of the water and fish—Xianchi is a star, and the water and fish are celestial deities. The Celestial River Gate is the threshold of the host of spirits. *Que* means "gate." The Four Palaces are responsible for administering rewards and punishments. The Four Palaces are the Purple Palace, Xuanyuan, Xianchi, and Celestial River Gate. The Supreme Subtlety governs the Vermilion Bird, *zhu* meaning "to oversee." The Purple Palace holds the Dipper and revolves leftward, the sun moving one degree per day to complete its circuit of the heavens. At the winter solstice, the sun reaches the Mountain of the Steep Wolf, the southernmost mountain. Moving one degree per day, the moon travels 182 and five-eighths degrees to reach the Mountain of the Ox’s Head at the summer solstice—the Ox’s Head is the northernmost mountain. After 365 and one-quarter degrees, a year is completed.

At the beginning of the Heavenly One’s cycle, in the first month, *jianyin*, the sun and moon both enter *Yingshi* at five degrees. After seventy-six years, the Heavenly One completes its initial cycle, and the sun and moon again enter *Yingshi* at five degrees in the first month, with no remainder—this is called one *ji*. After twenty *ji*, 1,520 years, the great cycle ends. The sun, moon, and stars return to the beginning of *jiayin*. The sun moves one degree per day, and the year has an excess of one-quarter degree, so after four years, 1,461 days accumulate, and the celestial bodies return to their original positions. After eighty years, the sun returns to its original (day).

*Zi-wu* and *mao-you* are the two cords—*sheng* means "straight." *Chou-yin*, *chen-si*, *wei-shen*, and *xu-hai* are the four hooks. The northeast is the corner of repaying virtue—*bao* means "to return." Yin qi reaches its extreme in the north, and yang qi arises in the east; from yin returning to yang, it is called the corner of repaying virtue.

The four corners are called *wei*. The southwest is the corner of turning from yang—having passed the southwest, yang is about to return to yin, hence it is called the corner of turning from yang. The southeast is the corner of *changyang*—*changyang* means neither advancing nor retreating. In the southeast, pure yang prevails, neither flourishing nor declining, ever thus, hence it is called the corner of *changyang*. The northwest is the corner of □-through—pure yin prevails in the northwest, and yang qi is closed and congealed; as yang qi is about to sprout, it first breaks through, hence it is called the corner of □-through.

At the winter solstice, the Dipper aligns northward with the cord; yin qi reaches its extreme, and yang qi begins to sprout, hence the winter solstice is called *virtue*. *Virtue* means "beginning to grow." At the summer solstice, the Dipper aligns southward with the cord; yang qi reaches its extreme, and yin qi begins to sprout, hence the summer solstice is called *punishment*. *Punishment* means "beginning to diminish."

When yin qi reaches its extreme, it descends to the Yellow Springs and extends north to the North Pole, hence one must not dig the earth or bore wells. All things close and hide; hibernating creatures retreat into their burrows, hence it is said that *virtue* resides indoors. When yang qi reaches its extreme, it extends south to the South Pole and rises to the Vermilion Heaven, hence one must not level mounds or ascend rooftops. All things flourish and multiply; the five grains begin to grow, hence it is said that *virtue* resides in the wilds.

At the winter solstice, water follows; at the summer solstice, fire follows. Thus, in the fifth month, the fire regulator prevails and water leaks—*fire regulator* means fire is ascendant, hence water seeps and leaks. Another explanation: when the Fire Star aligns at the center, the earth becomes damp. In the eleventh month, the water regulator prevails and yin overcomes—*water regulator* means water is ascendant, hence yin prevails. Another explanation: when the Encampment Mansion aligns at the center in the south.

Yang qi becomes fire, and yin qi becomes water; water prevails, hence at the summer solstice it is damp; fire prevails, hence at the winter solstice it is dry. Dryness makes charcoal light; dampness makes charcoal heavy.

At the solstice, well water swells, basin water overflows, sheep shed their wool, elk shed their antlers, and magpies begin to change their winter habits and build nests. An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of one zhang and three chi at noon.

At the summer solstice, flowing yellow oozes forth; the essence of stone appears. *Flowing yellow* is the essence of earth; yin qi stirs below, hence it oozes forth. *Stone essence* is the essence of the five colors. Cicadas begin to sing; *banxia* sprouts—*banxia* is a medicinal herb. Mosquitoes and horseflies do not bite foals or calves; birds of prey do not seize fledglings. In the fifth month, faint yin resides below; foals, calves, and fledglings are not yet fully grown, their flesh and blood tender, their limbs weak. Thus, mosquitoes and birds of prey, responding to yin, do not bite or seize them.

An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of one chi and five cun. When the shadow is long, yin qi prevails; when the shadow is short, yang qi prevails.

When yin qi prevails, there is flooding; when yang qi prevails, there is drought. The interplay of yin and yang’s punitive and virtuous powers unfolds across seven abodes.

What are the seven abodes? Chamber, hall, courtyard, gate, lane, thoroughfare, and wilds. For thirty days in the twelfth month, virtue resides in the chamber—fifteen days before the solstice and fifteen days after—before moving onward. Each abode it occupies endures for thirty days. When virtue is in the chamber, punishment lies in the wilds; when virtue is in the hall, punishment lies in the thoroughfare; when virtue is in the courtyard, punishment lies in the lane. When yin and yang harmonize in virtue, punishment and virtue converge at the gate. In the eighth and second months, yin and yang qi are balanced, day and night equal in length—thus it is said that punishment and virtue converge at the gate. When virtue faces south, life flourishes; when punishment faces south, life is cut short. Hence it is said: in the second month, all things converge and flourish; in the eighth month, all things converge and grasses and trees wither.

Between the two corners lies ninety-one and one-quarter degrees. From the northeast to the southeast are the two corners; encompassing the four corners are three hundred sixty-five degrees, each degree spanning two thousand nine hundred thirty-two *li*. The sun ascends by five sixteenths of a degree daily, traversing one degree in fifteen days to form a nodal period, thereby generating the twenty-four solar terms.

When the Dipper points to *zi*, it is the winter solstice, its tone corresponding to *Huangzhong*—*Huangzhong* being the eleventh month. *Zhong* means "to gather"; yang qi gathers beneath the Yellow Springs. Fifteen days later, when it points to *gui*, it is *Lesser Cold*, its tone corresponding to *Yingzhong*—*Yingzhong* being the tenth month. It signifies yin responding to yang, completing its work as all things gather and store in season—hence it is called *Yingzhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *chou*, it is *Greater Cold*, its tone corresponding to *Wuyi*—*Wuyi* being the ninth month. Yin qi rises while yang qi descends; all things follow yang in concealment, none venturing forth—hence it is called *Wuyi*. Fifteen days later, when it points to the corner of *Baode*, yin prevails upon the earth. Thus it is said: forty-six days after the winter solstice comes *Lichun*, when frozen yang thaws, its tone corresponding to *Nanlü*—*Nanlü* being the eighth month. *Nan* means "to bear"; yang qi lies concealed within while yin harmonizes with yang to fulfill its work—hence it is called *Nanlü*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *yin*, it is *Yushui*, its tone corresponding to *Yize*—*Yize* being the seventh month. *Yi* means "injury"; *ze* means "law." As yang wanes and yin emerges, all things wither and are injured, conforming to the law of their nature—hence it is called *Yize*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *jia*, it is *Jingzhe*, its tone corresponding to *Linzhong*—*Linzhong* being the sixth month. *Lin* means "multitude"; *zhong* means "to gather." As yang reaches its peak and yin begins to stir, all things gather in abundance—hence it is called *Linzhong*. Fifteen days later, when it aligns with the *mao* meridian, it is said that at the spring equinox, thunder moves, its tone corresponding to *Ruibin*—*Ruibin* being the fifth month. Yin qi droops below like a host, while yang presides above like a guest—hence it is called *Ruibin*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *yi*, the *Qingming* winds arrive, its tone corresponding to *Zhonglü*—*Zhonglü* being the fourth month. Yang lies without while yin resides within, thus *lü* extends to yang to assist in its work—hence it is called *Zhonglü*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *chen*, it is *Guyu*, its tone corresponding to *Guxi*—*Guxi* being the third month. *Gu* means "former"; *xi* means "new." Yang qi nurtures life, casting off the old for the new—hence it is called *Guxi*. Fifteen days later, when it points to the corner of *Changyang*, the spring equinox concludes. Thus it is said: forty-six days later comes *Lixia*, when great winds subside—*ji* meaning "to cease"—its tone corresponding to *Jiazhong*—*Jiazhong* being the second month. *Jia* means "to flank"; all things depart from yin and flank the yang earth to grow—hence it is called *Jiazhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *si*, it is *Xiaoman*—*Xiaoman* being the fourth month—its tone corresponding to *Taicou*—*Taicou* being the first month’s pitch. *Cou* means "to cluster"; as yin wanes and yang emerges, all things cluster upon the earth to grow—hence it is called *Taicou*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *bing*, it is *Mangzhong*, its tone corresponding to *Dalü*—*Dalü* being the twelfth month’s pitch. *Lü* means "companion"; all things stir below but have yet to emerge—hence it is called *Dalü*, paired with *Huangzhong* to aid yang in manifesting its work. Fifteen days later, when it points to *wu*, yang qi reaches its peak. Thus it is said: forty-six days later comes the summer solstice, its tone corresponding to *Huangzhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *ding*, it is *Xiaoshu*, its tone corresponding to *Dalü*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *wei*, it is *Dashu*, its tone corresponding to *Taicou*. Fifteen days later, when it points to the corner of *Beiyang*, the summer solstice concludes. Thus it is said: forty-six days later comes *Liqiu*, when cool winds arrive, its tone corresponding to *Jiazhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *shen*, it is *Chushu*, its tone corresponding to *Guxi*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *geng*, white dew descends, its tone corresponding to *Zhonglü*. Fifteen days later, when it aligns with the *you* meridian, it is said that at the autumn equinox, thunder retreats, hibernating creatures turn northward, its tone corresponding to *Ruibin*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *xin*, it is *Hanlu*, its tone corresponding to *Linzhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *xu*, it is *Shuangjiang*, its tone corresponding to *Yize*. Fifteen days later, when it points to the corner of *Tong*, the autumn equinox concludes. Thus it is said: forty-six days later comes *Lidong*, when grasses and trees perish entirely, its tone corresponding to *Nanlü*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *hai*, it is *Xiaoxue*, its tone corresponding to *Wuyi*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *ren*, it is *Daxue*, its tone corresponding to *Yingzhong*. Fifteen days later, when it points to *zi*, it is said: yang is born at *zi*, yin is born at *wu*. Yang is born at *zi*; thus in the eleventh month, at the winter solstice, magpies begin to build nests, and human qi converges at the head. Yin is born at *wu*; thus the fifth month is a time of lesser punishment, when shepherd’s purse and wheat wither, and winter-grown grasses and trees must die. The Dipper’s handle marks the lesser year: the first through fourth stars form the *kui*, while the fifth through seventh form the *shao*.

In the first month, the establishment is at *yin*, with the moon following the sequence of the twelve earthly branches. The *Xianchi* serves as the Great Year. In the second month, the establishment is at *mao*, with the moon proceeding rightward through the four extensions, cycling endlessly. When one faces the Great Year, disgrace follows; when one turns away, strength ensues. To the left brings decline; to the right brings prosperity. The Lesser Year: to the southeast brings life, to the northwest brings death. One must not face it, but may turn away; one must not go left, but may go right—this is what is meant.

The Great Time is the *Xianchi*. The Lesser Time is the monthly establishment. The celestial framework begins its cycle invariably at *yin*, commencing with a rightward shift. Each year it moves once, completing a full celestial cycle in twelve years, then beginning anew.

*Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll Five, concludes.

*Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll Six, recorded by Minister of the Grand Commandant and Libationer Xu Shen.

**Heavenly Patterns, Part Three**

In the winter of the first year of *Huainan*, the Great Unity was at *bingzi*; the winter solstice fell on *jiawu*, and the beginning of spring on *bingzi*. This was the first year of the composition of the *Huainanzi*. Another account states: King Liu Chang of Huainan, younger half-brother of Emperor Xiaowen of Han, usurped the title of Eastern Emperor. Exiled to Yandao, he died in Yong, and his four sons were all enfeoffed as marquises. At the time, people sang of him:

*A foot of silk, so fine and bright,
A pint of grain, so full and light.
Two brothers, yet they could not share—
Such strife was more than they could bear.*

When Emperor Wen heard this, he said, "Do they think I covet their lands?" He summoned the four marquises and made them kings. Thus, this marks the first year of King Liu An of Huainan’s reign, recorded to establish the era.

Two *yin* and one *yang* form *qi* as two; two *yang* and one *yin* form *qi* as three. *Yin* is coarse, thus it receives less *qi*; *yang* is refined, thus it receives more. Another explanation: the upper receives two, the lower receives three, combining to make five. Hence, "combined *qi* produces sound," and the number of sounds is five. Combined *qi* produces sound, combined *yin* produces *yang*, and combined *yang* produces pitch. Thus, there are five notes and six pitches. Sound doubles to form days, and pitch doubles to form celestial stems. Hence, there are ten days and twelve stems.

The moon travels thirteen degrees and seventy-six twenty-sixths of a degree per day (some texts read "eight" for "six"). Twenty-nine days and four hundred ninety-nine nine-hundred-fortieths of a day make a month, and twelve months make a year. The year has an excess of ten days and eight hundred twenty-seven nine-hundred-fortieths of a day, so after nineteen years, seven intercalary months are added.

The winter solstice occurs at *zi* and *wu*; the summer solstice at *mao* and *you*. Three days after the winter solstice is the day of the summer solstice. Three days after the winter solstice marks the summer solstice of the following year. The year shifts by six days, then returns to its beginning. This six-day shift means that if this year’s winter solstice is at *zi*, next year’s will be at *wu*.

When the winter solstice falls on *renwu*, *jiazi* receives control, and Wood governs affairs—fire smoke turns green. Wood’s color is green, associated with the east. After seventy-two days, *bingzi* receives control, and Fire governs affairs—fire smoke turns red. Fire’s color is red, associated with the south. After seventy-two days, *wuzi* receives control, and Earth governs affairs—fire smoke turns yellow. Earth is central, its color yellow. After seventy-two days, *gengzi* receives control, and Metal governs affairs—fire smoke turns white. Metal is of the west, its color white. After seventy-two days, *renzi* receives control, and Water governs affairs—fire smoke turns black. Water is of the north, its color black. After seventy-two days, the year concludes. *Gengzi* receives control, the year shifts by six days, and by calculation, after seventy years, it returns to *jiazi*.

When *jiazi* receives control, one should act with gentle kindness, lift prohibitions, open gates, clear obstructions, and refrain from felling trees. *Jia* is Wood, which rules the east; thus, one enacts gentle kindness. Hibernating creatures emerge from their burrows, so gates are opened, obstructions cleared. As Wood rules in spring, trees must not be felled.

When *bingzi* receives control, one should promote the worthy and good, reward merit, establish marquises, and distribute wealth. Fire governs affairs, symbolizing bright *yang*; merit is recognized, so marquises are enfeoffed, and wealth is distributed.

When *wuzi* receives control, one should care for the elderly, widows, and orphans, distribute gruel and porridge, and bestow grace. Earth governs affairs, symbolizing Earth’s nurturing nature; thus, grace is bestowed.

When *gengzi* receives control, one should repair walls and ramparts, fortify cities, enforce prohibitions, prepare armor and weapons, admonish officials, and punish the lawless. Metal governs affairs, symbolizing Metal’s cutting nature; thus, those who violate the law are punished.

When *renzi* receives control, one should close gates, conduct thorough searches, ban searches of guests, expel new guests, enforce punishments, execute the guilty, close passes and bridges, and prohibit migration. Water governs affairs, symbolizing winter’s closure; thus, migration is forbidden.

The *qi* of *jiazi* is dry and turbid; the *qi* of *bingzi* is dry and *yang*; the *qi* of *wuzi* is damp and turbid; the *qi* of *gengzi* is dry and cold; the *qi* of *renzi* is clear and cold.

If *bingzi* encroaches on *jiazi*, hibernating creatures emerge early, as Wood’s *qi* is warm—thus, they emerge early, and thunder arrives prematurely.

If *wuzi* encroaches on *jiazi*, embryos die, eggs fail to hatch, and birds and insects suffer harm.

If *gengzi* encroaches on *jiazi*, there is war.

If *renzi* encroaches on *jiazi*, frost appears in spring.

If *wuzi* encroaches on *bingzi*, there is thunder.

If *gengzi* encroaches on *bingzi*, there is injury (some texts read "lightning" for "injury").

If *renzi* encroaches on *bingzi*, there is hail.

If *jiazi* encroaches on *bingzi*, the earth quakes.

If *gengzi* encroaches on *wuzi*, the five grains suffer calamity.

If *renzi* encroaches on *wuzi*, summer is cold with frost and rain.

If *jiazi* encroaches on *wuzi*, armored insects do not form.

If *bingzi* encroaches on *wuzi*, there is severe drought, and *luo* plants wither. *Luo* is the *jiang* grass, which grows in water (or on land), its stalks intertwining to form mats. It is called *feng*. Drought dries it, hence it withers.

If *renzi* encroaches on *gengzi*, there is great hardness, and fish do not form.

If *jiazi* encroaches on *gengzi*, plants and trees die and revive.

If *bingzi* encroaches on *gengzi*, plants and trees bloom again. Now, in the eighth and ninth months, plums and crabapples bloom again and bear fruit—this is the case.

If *wuzi* encroaches on *gengzi*, the year may be preserved or lost.

If *jiazi* encroaches on *renzi*, winter fails to store. "Fails to store" means Earth’s *qi* is released.

If *bingzi* encroaches on *renzi*, stars fall. "Fall" means to descend.

If *wuzi* encroaches on *renzi*, hibernating creatures emerge in winter from their dens.

If *gengzi* encroaches on *renzi*, there is winter thunder in their region.

In the third month of late spring, *Fenglong* emerges to usher in the rain. *Fenglong* is thunder. By the third month of late autumn, Earth’s *qi* ceases to store, and its killing force is gathered. The hundred insects hibernate, dwelling quietly behind closed doors, as the killing *qi* prevails.

The Blue Maiden emerges to descend frost and snow. The Blue Maiden is the celestial deity Qingyu Nü, who governs frost and thunder. She circulates the *qi* of the twelve hours, and by the evening of the second month of mid-spring, she withdraws her store and seals away the cold—gathering what she has stored and closing it away.

Nüyi strikes the drum and sings to harmonize Heaven’s harmony, to nurture the hundred grains, birds, beasts, grasses, and trees. Nüyi presides over spring and summer, the deity of growth and nourishment. In the first month of early summer, the grains and millet ripen, and the male turtledove calls long, heralding the year for the emperor and lords. The male turtledove is the cuckoo.

Thus, if Heaven does not release its *yin*, the myriad things do not come to life; if Earth does not release its *yang*, the myriad things do not mature. Heaven is round, Earth is square, and the Dao resides at the center. The sun embodies *virtue*, the moon embodies punishment; when the moon returns, the myriad things die, and when the sun reaches its solstice, the myriad things are born.

Distant mountains conceal their mountain *qi*; distant waters cause their aquatic creatures to hibernate; distant trees cause their leaves to wither. If the sun is not seen for five days, it has lost its position, and the sage does not rejoice—for *yu* means "to delight."

The sun rises from Yang Valley, bathes in the Bitter Pool, and brushes past Fusang—this is called *Morning Light*. *Fu* means "to pass." This marks the first arrival of the day. Ascending Fusang, it begins its journey—this is called *Dawn’s Glimmer*. *Dawn’s Glimmer* signifies the approach of light. *Fei* is read as in *feinuogao*. Reaching Qu’e, this is called *Daybreak*—the break of dawn. Arriving at Zengquan, this is called *Early Meal*. Reaching Sangye, this is called *Late Meal*. Reaching Hengyang, this is called *Corner Noon*. Reaching Kunwu, this is called *True Noon*. Kunwu is a hill in the south. Reaching the Bird’s Roost, this is called *Lesser Return*. The Bird’s Roost is a mountain in the southwest where birds lodge. Reaching Sorrowful Valley, this is called *Evening Meal*. Sorrowful Valley is a great ravine in the southwest—its depths are so steep that gazing upon it evokes sorrow, hence its name. Reaching Nüji, this is called *Greater Return*. Nüji is a *yin* land in the northwest. Reaching Yuan’ao, this is called *High Pestle*. Yuan’ao is a place name. *High Pestle* refers to the hour of *xu*, when people pound their grain. Reaching Lianshi, this is called *Lower Pestle*. Lianshi is a mountain in the northwest. As dusk approaches, the image of pestles at work below is complete, hence *Lower Pestle*. *Lian* is read as in "rotten." Reaching Sorrowful Spring, she halts her maidens and rests her horses—this is called *Hanging the Chariot*. Reaching Yu’ao, this is called *Dusk*. Reaching Meng Valley, this is called *Settling Dusk*. Meng Valley is a mountain in the north—the place where Lu Ao saw the "above" as described. The sun sets at the shore of Yu’ao and dawns at the bank of Meng Valley. *Shu* means "bright"; *pu* means "shore."

The sun traverses the nine provinces and seven lodges, covering 510,739 *li*. From Yang Valley to Yu’ao, there are sixteen stations, comprising the nine provinces and seven lodges. Yu divided them into morning, day, dusk, and night.

At the summer solstice, *yin* rides over *yang*, and thus the myriad things wither and die. At the winter solstice, *yang* rides over *yin*, and thus the myriad things rise and live. Day is the portion of *yang*; night is the portion of *yin*. Therefore, when *yang* *qi* prevails, the days lengthen and the nights shorten; when *yin* *qi* prevails, the days shorten and the nights lengthen.

The Emperor stretches the four cords and rotates them with the Dipper. *Yun* means "to revolve." The moon shifts one celestial mansion and then returns to its place. In the first month, it points to *yin*; in the twelfth month, it points to *chou*—completing a full cycle in a year before beginning anew.

When it points to *yin*, the myriad things stir—*yin* signifies the appearance of movement. The pitch receives *Tai Cang*. *Tai Cang* is the sprouting that has yet to emerge. When it points to *mao*, *mao* flourishes abundantly. The pitch receives *Jia Zhong*. *Jia Zhong* is when seeds begin to pod. When it points to *chen*, *chen* causes things to shake. The pitch receives *Gu Xi*. *Gu Xi* is the old departing and the new arriving. When it points to *si*, *si* signifies life has taken form. The pitch receives *Zhong Lü*. *Zhong Lü* is the center filling and expanding. When it points to *wu*, *wu* means opposition. The pitch receives *Rui Bin*. *Rui Bin* is peace and submission. When it points to *wei*, *wei* means obscurity. The pitch receives *Lin Zhong*. *Lin Zhong* is drawing to a halt. When it points to *shen*, *shen* means groaning. The pitch receives *Yi Ze*. *Yi Ze* is the changing of norms, and *virtue* departs. When it points to *you*, *you* means fullness. The pitch receives *Nan Lü*. *Nan Lü* is bearing and encompassing greatness. When it points to *xu*, *xu* means extinction. The pitch receives *Wu Yi*. *Wu Yi* enters into insatiability. When it points to *hai*, *hai* means closure. The pitch receives *Ying Zhong*. *Ying Zhong* is responding to its bell. When it points to *zi*, *zi* means "here." The pitch receives *Huang Zhong*. *Huang Zhong* is the bell having turned yellow. When it points to *chou*, *chou* means binding. The pitch receives *Da Lü*. *Da Lü* is traveling away in succession.

When it aligns with *mao* and *you*, *yin* and *yang* divide, and day and night are balanced. Thus it is said: the compass gives life, the square brings death; the balance beam extends, the steelyard conceals; the plumb line resides at the center, serving as the root of the four seasons.

The Dao is called the compass. It begins with the One, yet the One does not generate, so it divides into *yin* and *yang*. *Yin* and *yang* unite in harmony, and the myriad things are born. Thus it is said: the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates the myriad things.

Heaven and Earth take three months to form a season. Therefore, sacrificial rites use three servings of rice as propriety; mourning observances use three leaps as ritual; and military regulations use three layers of armor as system. Taking three to verify things, three threes make nine. Thus, the pitch of *Huang Zhong* is nine inches, and the *gong* note is harmonized—*tiao* means "harmony." Multiplying nine by nine yields eighty-one, so the number of *Huang Zhong* is established. *Huang* is the color of Earth’s *virtue*; *zhong* is where *qi* is sown.

At the winter solstice, the *virtue*-*qi* of Earth prevails, and Earth’s color is yellow—hence it is called *Huang Zhong*. The number of the pitch-pipes is six, divided into female and male, thus twelve pipes correspond to the twelve months. Each of the twelve is completed by threes, so setting one and multiplying eleven by three yields a product of 707,147—thus the great number of *Huang Zhong* is established. Altogether there are twelve pitch-pipes:

*Huang Zhong* as *gong*,
*Tai Cou* as *shang*,
*Gu Xi* as *jiao*,
*Lin Zhong* as *zhi*,
*Nan Lü* as *yu*.

Things are completed by threes, and sounds are established by fives. Three and five make eight, so creatures born from eggs have eight orifices. When the pitch-pipes first arise, they emulate the phoenix’s song—thus sound is born from eight. *Huang Zhong* is *gong*, and *gong* is the ruler of sounds. Therefore, *Huang Zhong* occupies the position of *zi*, its number is eighty-one, it governs the eleventh month, and descends to generate *Lin Zhong*. *Lin Zhong*’s number is fifty-four, it governs the sixth month, and ascends to generate *Tai Cou*. *Tai Cou*’s number is seventy-two, it governs the first month, and descends to generate *Nan Lü*. *Nan Lü*’s number is forty-eight, it governs the eighth month, and ascends to generate *Gu Xi*. *Gu Xi*’s number is sixty-four, it governs the third month, and descends to generate *Ying Zhong*. *Ying Zhong*’s number is forty-two, it governs the tenth month, and ascends to generate *Rui Bin*. *Rui Bin*’s number is fifty-seven, it governs the fifth month, and ascends to generate *Da Lü*. *Da Lü*’s number is seventy-six, it governs the twelfth month, and descends to generate *Yi Ze*. *Yi Ze*’s number is fifty-one, it governs the seventh month, and ascends to generate *Jia Zhong*. *Jia Zhong*’s number is sixty-eight, it governs the second month, and descends to generate *Wu Yi*. *Wu Yi*’s number is forty-five, it governs the ninth month, and ascends to generate *Zhong Lü*. *Zhong Lü*’s number is sixty, it governs the fourth month, and reaches its limit without generating further.

*Zhi* generates *gong*, *gong* generates *shang*, *shang* generates *yu*, *yu* generates *jiao*, *jiao* generates *Gu Xi*, and *Gu Xi* generates *Ying Zhong*—when compared to the standard notes, they form harmony. *Ying Zhong* corresponds to the tenth month, and when compared to the standard notes, it forms harmony. *He* means "to follow sound," or is also called "harmony." *Ying Zhong* generates *Rui Bin*, which does not compare to the standard notes—thus it is called *miu*.

At the winter solstice, the sound corresponds to *Lin Zhong*, gradually growing more turbid. At the summer solstice, the sound corresponds to *Huang Zhong*, gradually growing clearer. The twelve pitch-pipes respond to the twenty-four seasonal changes: *jia-zi* is the *zhi* of *Zhong Lü*; *bing-zi* is the *yu* of *Jia Zhong*; *wu-zi* is the *gong* of *Huang Zhong*; *geng-zi* is the *shang* of *Wu Yi*; *ren-zi* is the *jiao* of *Yi Ze*.

In ancient times, the standards for measures, weights, and capacities were born of the Way of Heaven. The length of the *Huang Zhong* pitch-pipe is nine inches. Things are generated by threes, and three nines make twenty-seven—thus the width of cloth is two feet and seven inches. In ancient times, all cloth widths were like this. Sound is generated by eights, so a person’s height is eight *chi*. A *xun* is double this, so eight *chi* make one *xun*. Where there is form, there is sound. The number of sounds is five, and multiplying five by eight yields forty—thus forty *chi* make one *pi*. A *pi* is the measure of an average person, and one *pi* establishes the standard.

At the autumn equinox, the *biao* is fixed, and when the *biao* is fixed, the grain ripens. *Biao* refers to the awns of grain ears and the husks of millet. *Ding* means "completion," hence the grain ripens. The character for *biao* is read like *mao* in the phrase "there are cats and tigers," and in ancient texts was written as *miao*.

The number of the pitch-pipes is twelve, so twelve *biao* equal one grain of millet, and twelve grains of millet equal one *cun*. The pitch-pipes correspond to the celestial stems, and sounds correspond to the days. The number of days is ten, from *jia* to *gui*. Thus ten *cun* make one *chi*, and ten *chi* make one *zhang*. For capacity, twelve grains of millet equal one *fen*—*fen* refers to the division of weight into *zhu*. Twelve *fen* equal one *zhu*, and twelve *zhu* equal half a *liang*. The balance has left and right, so doubling it makes twenty-four *zhu* equal one *liang*.

Heaven has four seasons to complete one year, so multiplying by four yields sixteen—thus sixteen *liang* make one *jin*. Three months make one season, and thirty days make one month—thus thirty *jin* make one *jun*. Four seasons make one year—thus four *jun* make one *dan*. For sound, one pitch-pipe generates five notes, and twelve pitch-pipes make sixty sounds. Multiplying by six yields thirty-six—thus three hundred sixty sounds correspond to the days of one year. Therefore, the numbers of pitch-pipes and calendars are the Way of Heaven and Earth.

For descending generation, double the number and divide by three. For ascending generation, multiply by four and divide by three. The pitch-pipes generate one another in ascent and descent, guiding without haste.

The Great *Yin* begins at *jia-yin*. After one cycle, it reaches *jia-xu*; after two cycles, it reaches *jia-wu*; after three cycles, it returns to the origin of *jia-yin*. Each year it shifts one celestial stem. After the Beginning of Spring, it attains its stem and moves in its proper sequence. With three before and five after, all affairs may be undertaken. "Before and after" refer to the positions before and after the Great *Yin*. Where the Great *Yin* is established, hibernating insects first burrow into their dens, and magpies orient their nests toward it as a door.

When the Great *Yin* is in *yin*, the Vermilion Bird is in *mao*, the Curved Array is in *zi*, the Dark Warrior is in *xu*, the White Tiger is in *you*, and the Azure Dragon is in *chen*. *Yin* is *jian*, *mao* is *chu*, *chen* is *man*, *si* is *ping*—these govern generation. *Wu* is *ding*, *wei* is *zhi*—these govern decline. *Shen* is *po*—this governs balance. *You* is *wei*—this governs the handle. *Xu* is *cheng*—this governs lesser *virtue*. *Hai* is *shou*—this governs great *virtue*. *Zi* is *kai*—this governs the Grand Year. *Chou* is *bi*—this governs the Great *Yin*.

When the Great *Yin* is in *yin*, the year is called *She Ti Ge*. Its male counterpart is Jupiter, which resides in *Dou* and *Niu*, and in the eleventh month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Dong Jing* and *Yu Gui* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *mao*, the year is called *Shan E*. *Shan* is read as the *ming* in *mingyang*. Jupiter resides in *Xu Nü*, *Xu*, and *Wei*, and in the twelfth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Liu*, *Qi Xing*, and *Zhang* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *chen*, the year is called *Zhi Xu*. Jupiter resides in *Ying Shi* and *Dong Bi*, and in the first month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Yi* and *Zhen* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *si*, the year is called *Da Huang Luo*. Jupiter resides in *Kui* and *Lou*, and in the second month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Jiao* and *Kang* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *wu*, the year is called *Dun Zang*. Jupiter resides in *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi*, and in the third month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Di*, *Fang*, and *Xin* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *wei*, the year is called *Xie Qia*. Jupiter resides in *Zi Xiu* and *Shen*, and in the fourth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Wei* and *Ji* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *shen*, the year is called *Tun Tan*. Jupiter resides in *Dong Jing* and *Yu Gui*, and in the fifth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Dou* and *Qian Niu* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *you*, the year is called *Zuo E*. *Zuo* is read as *zuo*. Jupiter resides in *Liu*, *Qi Xing*, and *Zhang*, and in the sixth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Xu Nü*, *Xu*, and *Wei* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *xu*, the year is called *Yan Mao*. Jupiter resides in *Yi* and *Zhen*, and in the seventh month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Ying Shi* and *Dong Bi* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *hai*, the year is called *Da Yuan Xian*. Jupiter resides in *Jiao* and *Kang*, and in the eighth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Kui* and *Lou* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *zi*, the year is called *Kun Dun*. *Kun* is read as *qun*. Jupiter resides in *Di*, *Fang*, and *Xin*, and in the ninth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *chou*, the year is called *Chi Fen Ruo*. Jupiter resides in *Wei* and *Ji*, and in the tenth month rises with it in the eastern sky, with *Zi Xiu* and *Shen* opposite.

When the Great *Yin* is in *jiazi*, *Xing* and *De* converge in the eastern palace. They constantly shift to what they cannot overcome, converging for four years before parting, and parting for sixteen years before reconverging. The reason for their parting is that *Xing* cannot enter the central palace but shifts to *Wood*. Where the Great *Yin* resides is called *De*; the celestial branch is *Xing*. *De* is the *Gang* that doubles itself by cause, and the *Rou* that shifts to what it cannot overcome. *Xing* is *Water* in the branch of *Wood*, and *Wood* in the branch of *Water*; *Metal* and *Fire* establish their positions. In all shifts of the spirits, the Vermilion Bird is one position ahead of the Great *Yin*, the Curved Array is three positions behind, the Dark Warrior is five positions ahead, the White Tiger is six positions behind, and the *Xu* star rides the Curved Array, whereupon Heaven and Earth converge. *Xi* means harmony.

In all cases, *jia* is firm and *yi* is yielding, *bing* is firm and *ding* is yielding, continuing thus to *gui*. *Wood* is born in *hai*, matures in *mao*, and dies in *wei*—these three branches are all *Wood*. *Fire* is born in *yin*, matures in *wu*, and dies in *xu*—these three branches are all *Fire*. *Earth* is born in *wu*, matures in *xu*, and dies in *yin*—these three branches are all *Earth*. *Metal* is born in *si*, matures in *you*, and dies in *chou*—these three branches are all *Metal*. *Water* is born in *shen*, matures in *zi*, and dies in *chen*—these three branches are all *Water*. Thus, the five conquests give birth to one, mature at five, and end at nine. Five times nine is forty-five, so the spirits shift once every forty-five days, responding to three with five, and after eight shifts, the year concludes.

When employing the Great *Yin*, strike to the left with *Xing* ahead and to the right with *De* behind. Attack the opposing branch of the Curved Array, and in battle, victory is assured; in assault, conquest is certain. To know the Way of Heaven, take the sun as the master. In the sixth month, it aligns with the heart, circling leftward, dividing into twelve months corresponding to the days. Heaven and Earth converge in double harmony, and afterward, no misfortune will befall.

The stars: in the first month, *Ying Shi* is established; in the second month, *Kui* and *Lou*; in the third month, *Wei*. The stars should refer to the sun. The *Ming Tang Yue Ling* states: in the first month of spring, the sun is in *Ying Shi*; in the second month, in *Kui* and *Lou*; in the third month, in *Wei*. This means the stars establish *Ying Shi* in the first month—there is an error in the character.

In the fourth month, *Bi* is established; in the fifth month, *Dong Jing*; in the sixth month, *Zhang*; in the seventh month, *Yi*; in the eighth month, *Kang*; in the ninth month, *Fang*; in the tenth month, *Wei*; in the eleventh month, *Qian Niu*; in the twelfth month, *Xu*.

The degrees of the stellar divisions: *Jiao* twelve, *Kang* nine, *Di* fifteen, *Fang* five, *Xin* five, *Wei* eighteen, *Ji* eleven and one quarter, *Dou* twenty-six, *Qian Niu* eight, *Xu Nü* twelve, *Xu* ten, *Wei* seventeen, *Ying Shi* sixteen, *Dong Bi* nine, *Kui* sixteen, *Lou* twelve, *Wei* fourteen, *Mao* eleven, *Bi* sixteen, *Zi Xiu* two, *Shen* nine, *Dong Jing* thirty, *Yu Gui* four, *Liu* fifteen, *Qi Xing* seven, *Zhang* eighteen, *Yi* eighteen, *Zhen* seventeen—altogether the twenty-eight lodges.

The stellar lodges and their corresponding regions: *Jiao* and *Kang*: Zheng; *Di*, *Fang*, and *Xin*: Song; *Wei* and *Ji*: Yan; *Dou* and *Qian Niu*: Yue; *Xu Nü*: Wu; *Xu* and *Wei*: Qi; *Ying Shi* and *Dong Bi*: Wei; *Kui* and *Lou*: Lu; *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi*: Wei; *Zi Xiu* and *Shen*: Zhao; *Dong Jing* and *Yu Gui*: Qin; *Liu*, *Qi Xing*, and *Zhang*: Zhou; *Yi* and *Zhen*: Chu.

Where Jupiter resides, the five grains flourish abundantly. Its opposite is the opposing position, and in that year, misfortune befalls. If it should reside but does not, or strays to another position, the ruler dies and the state perishes.

When the Great *Yin* governs spring, it desires to enact gentle kindness and temperate coolness. The *virtue* of *Wood* is benevolence, hence the gentle coolness. When the Great *Yin* governs summer, it desires to bestow and proclaim clarity.

The *virtue* of *Fire* is yang, hence its bestowal and proclamation are partial brightness. When the Great *Yin* governs autumn, it desires to repair armaments and refine weapons. The *virtue* of *Metal* is severance and division, hence the refinement of weapons. When the Great *Yin* governs winter, it desires fierceness, resoluteness, and unyielding strength. Pure *yin* seals and solidifies; water congeals into ice, hence its unyielding strength.

After three years, its disposition changes; after six years, its norm alters. Thus, famine occurs once every three years, decline once every six, and prosperity once every twelve. *Kang* means abundance.

*Jia* corresponds to Qi, *Yi* to Eastern Yi, *Bing* to Chu, *Ding* to Southern Yi, *Wu* to Wei, *Ji* to Han, *Geng* to Qin, *Xin* to Western Yi, *Ren* to Wei, *Gui* to Yue, *Zi* to Zhou, *Chou* to Di, *Yin* to Chu, *Mao* to Zheng; *Chen* to Jin, *Si* to Wei, *Wu* to Qin, *Wei* to Song, *Shen* to Qi, *You* to Lu, *Xu* to Zhao, *Hai* to Yan.

*Jia*, *Yi*, *Yin*, and *Mao* belong to *Wood*. *Bing*, *Ding*, *Si*, and *Wu* belong to *Fire*. *Wu*, *Ji*, and the four seasons belong to *Earth*. *Geng*, *Xin*, *Shen*, and *You* belong to *Metal*. *Ren*, *Gui*, *Hai*, and *Zi* belong to *Water*.

*Water* generates *Wood*, *Wood* generates *Fire*, *Fire* generates *Earth*, *Earth* generates *Metal*, *Metal* generates *Water*. When the child generates the mother, it is called *righteousness*; when the mother generates the child, it is called *nurturance*. When child and mother unite, it is called *specialization*. When the mother overcomes the child, it is called *restraint*; when the child overcomes the mother, it is called *distress*.

To strike and kill with dominance brings victory without retaliation. To act with *specialization* yields success. To conduct affairs with *righteousness* establishes a name that does not falter. To nurture and cultivate with *nurturance* causes the myriad things to flourish abundantly. To undertake matters with *distress* leads to ruin, destruction, and death.

The deities of the Northern Dipper possess both feminine and masculine aspects. In the eleventh month, they begin their alignment at *zi*, with each month advancing by one celestial position. The masculine aspect moves leftward, while the feminine moves rightward. In the fifth month, they converge at *wu* to deliberate the celestial registers; in the eleventh month, they converge at *zi* to deliberate virtue. The position occupied by the Great Yin becomes the *yann* day—a day on which no affairs should be initiated.

The *Kanyu* moves slowly, and the masculine discerns the feminine by sound, thus forming the *qi* celestial stems. The reckoning begins with *jia-zi*, as child and mother seek one another, and their conjunction is called *he*. Ten days and twelve celestial branches complete a cycle of sixty days, totaling eight conjunctions. If the conjunction occurs before the year’s end, death follows; if after, no misfortune arises.

*Jia-xu* governs Yan; *yi-you*, Qi; *bing-wu*, Yue; *ding-si*, Chu; *geng-shen*, Qin; *xin-mao*, the Rong; *ren-zi*, Dai; *gui-hai*, the Hu. *Wu-xu* and *ji-hai* govern Han; *ji-you* and *ji-mao*, Wei; *wu-wu* and *wu-zi* unify the realm in eight conjunctions.

When the Great Yin, Lesser Year, stars, sun, and celestial branches—all five spirits—converge, and clouds, wind, or rain appear on that day, the ruler of the state shall bear the omen. Among celestial deities, none is more revered than the Azure Dragon, also called Heavenly One or the Great Yin. Where the Great Yin resides, one must not turn away but may face it. Where the Northern Dipper strikes, none may oppose.

Heaven and Earth are established, dividing into yin and yang. Yang arises from yin, and yin arises from yang. Yin and yang intertwine, and the four cardinal directions are thus connected. Life and death alternate, and all things come to be. Crawling creatures, those with beaks and breath, orifices and limbs—all communicate with Heaven. Heaven possesses nine layers and nine apertures.

Heaven has four seasons to regulate the twelve months, just as the four limbs govern the twelve joints. None is more noble than humanity, which employs its twelve joints. Thus, undertaking affairs contrary to Heaven’s will—beginning from the winter solstice to count the coming year’s first month and new moon—ensures the people’s sustenance is secure. If fewer than fifty days remain, each person consumes one *dou* daily. For each additional day, the ration increases by one *sheng*.

The governance of the year is as follows:

In the year of *Sheti Ge*, *ge* means "to rise." It speaks of the myriad things responding to yang and rising. The year brings early floods and late droughts; rice suffers blight, silkworms fail to mature (*deng* means "to complete"), soybeans and wheat flourish, and the people consume four *sheng* daily. At *yin*, within *jia*, it is called *Yanpeng*. It signifies the myriad things’ sharp edges poised to emerge, yet restrained and unopened—hence *Yanpeng*.

In the year of *Shanyan*, *shan* means "exhausted," and *yan* means "to halt." It speaks of yang qi propelling the myriad things to rise while yin qi is exhausted and ceases. The year is harmonious; rice, soybeans, wheat, and silkworms thrive, and the people consume five *sheng* daily. At *mao*, within *yi*, it is called *Zhanmeng*. Within *yi*, it signifies things obscured and restrained, breaking through their sheaths—hence *Zhanmeng*.

In the year of *Zhixu*, *zhi* means "concealed," and *xu* means "leisurely." It speaks of hibernating creatures all dispersing and emerging at ease. The year brings early droughts and late floods, minor famine, silkworms confined, wheat ripening, and the people consume three *sheng* daily. At *chen*, within *bing*, it is called *Rouzhao*. Within *bing*, the myriad things all sprout branches and spread leaves—hence *Rouzhao*.

In the year of *Dahuangluo*, *huang* means "great," and *luo* means "to scatter." It speaks of the myriad things flourishing and bursting forth, spreading abundantly. The year brings minor warfare, silkworms mature slightly, wheat thrives, soybeans suffer blight, and the people consume two *sheng* daily. At *si*, within *ding*, it is called *Qiangyu*. Within *ding*, the myriad things are robust and flourishing—hence *Qiangyu*.

In the year of *Dunzang*, it speaks of the myriad things all thriving and strong. *Dun* means "abundant," and *zang* means "vigorous." The year brings great droughts, silkworms mature, rice suffers blight, soybeans and wheat thrive, millet fails, and the people consume two *sheng* daily. At *wu*, within *wu*, it is called *Zhuyong*. Within *wu*, it signifies the central position, with the myriad things nourishing the four directions—hence *Zhuyong*.

In the year of *Xieqia*, *xie* means "harmony," and *qia* means "union." It speaks of yin desiring to transform and unite the myriad things. The year brings minor warfare, silkworms mature, rice thrives, soybeans and wheat fail, and the people consume three *sheng* daily. At *wei*, within *ji*, it is called *Tuwei*. Within *ji*, the myriad things each fulfill their nature—hence *Tuwei*. *Tu* means "to separate," and *wei* means "to part."

In the year of *Tuntan*, *tun* means "great," and *tan* means "to refine." It speaks of the myriad things all refining their essence and qi. The year is harmonious, with light rains, silkworms maturing, soybeans and wheat thriving, and the people consume three *sheng* daily. At *shen*, within *geng*, it is called *Shangzhang*. Within *geng*, yin qi ascends, and the myriad things reach completion—hence *Shangzhang*.

In the year of *Zuoe*, *zuoe* means "to wither and fall." The myriad things all decline. The year brings great warfare, pestilence among the people, silkworms failing to mature, soybeans and wheat failing, millet infested, and the people consume five *sheng* daily. At *you*, within *xin*, it is called *Chongguang*. Within *xin*, the myriad things reach maturity, shining brilliantly—hence *Chongguang*.

In the year of *Yanmao*, *yan* means "to conceal," and *mao* means "luxuriant." The myriad things are all obscured and covered. The year brings minor famine, warfare, silkworms failing to mature, wheat failing to thrive, and the people consume seven *sheng* daily. At *xu*, within *ren*, it is called *Xuanyi*. Within *ren*, it signifies the year’s end encompassing the myriad things—hence *Xuanyi*.

In the year of *Dayuanxian*, *yuan* means "to store," and *xian* means "to welcome." It speaks of the myriad things concluding at *hai*, with all—great and small—hidden and burrowed to welcome yang. The year brings great warfare, severe famine, silkworms emerging, soybeans and wheat failing, millet infested, and the people consume three *sheng* daily.

In the year of *Kundun*, *kun* means "chaotic," and *dun* means "turbid." It speaks of yang qi all mixed and murky, with the myriad things sprouting. The year brings great mists, floods, silkworms, rice, soybeans, and wheat thriving, and the people consume three *dou* daily. At *zi*, within *gui*, it is called *Zhaoyang*. Within *gui*, yang qi begins to sprout, and the myriad things unite in generation—hence *Zhaoyang*.

In the year of *Chifenruo*, *fen* means "to rise," and *ruo* means "to follow." It speaks of yang qi rousing the myriad things to rise, with none failing to follow their nature. *Chi* is the color of yang. The year brings minor warfare, droughts and floods, silkworms failing to emerge, rice blight, soybeans failing to grow, wheat thriving, and the people consume one *sheng* daily. At the first dawn—alternatively, the first month—of the year: in the evening, first plant a gnomon in the east, then hold another gnomon and retreat ten paces from the first. Align the sight with the sun’s first emergence at its northern edge. When the sun is directly overhead at its setting, plant another gnomon in the east, and using the western gnomon, align the sight with the sun’s entry at its northern edge to determine the east. The midpoint between the two gnomons, together with the western gnomon, marks the true east-west line.

At the winter solstice, the sun rises at the southeast corner and sets at the southwest corner. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, it rises due east and sets due west. At the summer solstice, it rises at the northeast corner and sets at the northwest corner, and at noon it is due south. To determine the breadth and length of the east-west and north-south distances: erect four gnomons to form a square with sides of one *li*. Before the spring equinox or after the autumn equinox by ten days or more, from the northern gnomon align the sight with the sun’s first emergence at dawn to await the corresponding moment. When the alignment corresponds, this marks the point directly beneath the sun. Immediately align the sight with the southern gnomon, using the number of *cun* where the sun enters the front gnomon as the divisor to calculate the breadth. Subtract the length of the erected gnomon to determine the east-west distance from this point. For example, if the sun enters the center of the front gnomon by one *cun*, then one *cun* corresponds to one *li*. One *li* contains eighteen thousand *cun*, so from this point eastward it is eighteen thousand *li*. If the sun enters the front gnomon by half a *cun*, then half a *cun* corresponds to one *li*. Dividing the accumulated *cun* of one *li* by half a *cun* yields thirty-six thousand *li*, which is the westward distance from this point. Summing the east and west distances gives the total diameter.

If the alignment occurs before the spring equinox or fails to occur after the autumn equinox, this location is south of the center. If the alignment occurs before the autumn equinox or fails to occur after the spring equinox, this location is north of the center. If the alignment occurs precisely at the equinoxes or solstices, this location is at the central point between north and south. From the central point, to determine the distance to the southern extreme: if the alignment fails to occur before the autumn equinox, this location is at the central point between north and south. To determine the distance to the northern or southern extremes from the central point: from the southwestern gnomon, align the sight with the sun. At the summer solstice, when the sun first emerges, align it with the northern gnomon, which will be equal to the distance from the east to the northeastern gnomon. Due east is eighteen thousand *li*, so from the center northward is also eighteen thousand *li*. Doubling this gives the total north-south distance. For locations not at the center, adjust the calculation based on the number of *cun* the sun enters or exits the front gnomon: for every *cun* the sun enters the gnomon, the sun is one *li* closer; for every *cun* it exits, the sun is one *li* farther.

To determine the height of the heavens: erect a gnomon ten *chi* tall, with a north-south distance of one thousand *li* between gnomons. On the same day, measure their shadows. The northern gnomon casts a shadow of two *chi*, while the southern gnomon casts a shadow of one *chi* and nine *cun*. This means that for every thousand *li* southward, the shadow shortens by one *cun*. At twenty thousand *li* south, there is no shadow—this is the point directly beneath the sun. A shadow of two *chi* corresponding to a gnomon height of one *zhang* means that for every one unit southward, the height increases by five. Thus, taking the distance from this point south to the point beneath the sun and multiplying by five gives one hundred thousand *li*, which is the height of the heavens. If the shadow equals the height of the gnomon, then the height equals the distance.

**Topical Study on Earthly Forms**

This section records the mountains, rivers, marshes, and lakes of the east, west, south, and north—the earth’s burdens and the manifestations of the myriad things’ transformations. Hence it is called *Earthly Forms* and thus titles the chapter.

The earth bears all within the Six Directions and the Four Extremes. The Six Directions were previously explained in *The Primal Dao*. The Four Extremes are the farthest reaches of the four directions. Beyond them lies nothing, so they are called “within.” The sun and moon illuminate it; the stars and constellations traverse it; the four seasons order it; and the Great Year governs it. *Governs* here means *to correct*—the position of the Great Year corrects the celestial timing.

Between heaven and earth lie the Nine Provinces and Eight Extremes. The Eight Extremes are the farthest reaches of the eight directions. The earth has nine mountains, nine strategic passes, nine marshes, eight winds, and six waters.

What are the Nine Provinces?
The Divine Province of the southeast is called *Agricultural Soil*. The southeast’s *chen* constellation governs agriculture, where Hou Ji wove his patterns—hence it is called *Agricultural Soil*.
The next province due south is called *Fertile Soil*. *Fertile* means *abundant*. The fifth month aligns with *wu*, when crops flourish—hence it is called *Fertile Soil*.
The Rong Province of the southwest is called *Vast Soil*. *Vast* means *great*. The seventh month aligns with *shen*, when the five grains grow large—hence it is called *Vast Soil*.
The Yan Province due west is called *Unified Soil*. *Unified* means *completed*. The eighth month aligns with *you*, when the hundred grains ripen—hence it is called *Unified Soil*.
The central Ji Province is called *Central Soil*. *Ji* means *great*, as it governs the four directions—hence it is called *Central Soil*.
The Tai Province of the northwest is called *Rich Soil*.
The Ji Province due north is called *Completed Soil*—its meaning is unknown.
The Bo Province of the northeast is called *Hidden Soil*. *Bo* means *level*, as it is where the hidden *qi* lies concealed—hence it is called *Hidden Soil*.
The Yang Province due east is called *Renewed Soil*. *Renewed* means *repeated*, for when the *yin* *qi* is exhausted in the north, the *yang* *qi* revives in the northeast—hence it is called *Renewed Soil*.

What are the Nine Mountains?
They are Mount Kuaiji, Mount Tai, Mount Wangwu, Mount Shou, Mount Taihua, Mount Qi, Mount Taihang, Mount Yangchang, and Mengmen.
Mount Kuaiji lies in Kuaiji Commandery.
Mount Tai is now in Taishan Commandery—it is the Eastern Marchmount.
Mount Wangwu is northeast of present-day Heng County in Hedong, where the Shen River rises.
Mount Shou lies south of Puban County in the bend of the Yellow River—it is where Boyi hid.
Mount Taihua is now Mount Yin in Hongnong—it is the Western Marchmount.
Mount Qi is north of present-day Hanyang County in Fufeng—it was the capital of the Zhou.
Mount Taihang is now at Taihang Pass in Shangdang, directly aligned with Yewang County in Henan.
Mount Yangchang is a mountain. The *Garden of Persuasions* states: “Jie’s dwelling had the Yellow River and Ji River to the left, Mount Taihua to the right, Yique to the south, and Yangchang to the north.” Now, ninety *li* northwest of Jinyang in Taiyuan, a pass called Yangchangji connects Hexi and Shang Commandery—this is Mengmen, the boundary of Mount Taihang.

What are the Nine Strategic Passes?
They are Dafeng, Miane, Jingruan, Fangcheng, Xiaohan, Jingxing, Lingci, Gouzhu, and Juyong.
Dafeng is in Jin.
Miane is now Mianchi in Hongnong.
Jingruan and Fangcheng are both in Chu.
Xiaohan is in Hongnong Commandery’s Mianchi, at Xiaoyin.
Jingxing is in Changshan, the pass to Taiyuan.
Lingci is in Liaoxi.
Gouzhu is in Yanmen, at Yinguang Gouzhu.
Juyong is east of Zuyang in Shanggu, the pass to Yundu.

What are the Nine Marshes?
*Marshes* here means *lakes*.
They are Juqu in Yue, Yunmeng in Chu, Yangyu in Qin, Dalu in Jin, Putian in Zheng, Mengzhu in Song, Haiyu in Qi, Julu in Zhao, and Zhaoyu in Yan.
Juqu lies between Wu and Yue.
Yunmeng is in Huarong in Nanjun.
Yangyu, also called Jupu, is likely in Chiyang in Fengyi.
Dalu is where Wei Xianzi perished in flames.
Putian is now in Zhongmou in Henan. The *Commentary* states: “Zheng has Yuanpu, just as Qin has Jupu. You may take its elk and deer to ease our state’s troubles.”
Mengzhu is now in Suiyang, the marsh northeast of Liangyuan.
Haiyu means *seacoast*, likely near the sea’s edge.
Julu is now the Guang’e Marsh.
Zhaoyu is now in Taiyuan Commandery—it once belonged to Yan.

What are the Eight Winds?
The northeast wind is called *Blazing Wind*, born of *gen* *qi*—also called *Fusion Wind*.
The east wind is called *Seasonal Wind*, born of *zhen* *qi*—also called *Bright Multitude Wind*.
The southeast wind is called *Scenic Wind*, born of *xun* *qi*—also called *Clear Brightness Wind*.
The south wind is called *Mighty Wind*, born of mixed *qi*—also called *Joyous Wind*.
The southwest wind is called *Cool Wind*, born of *kun* *qi*.
The west wind is called *Whistling Wind*, born of *dui* *qi*.
The northwest wind is called *Luminous Wind*, born of *qian* *qi*—also called *Gate-Shutting Wind*.
The north wind is called *Cold Wind*, born of *kan* *qi*—also called *Vast Desert Wind*.

What are the Six Waters?
They are the Yellow River, Red Water, Liao River, Black Water, Yangzi River, and Huai River.
The Yellow River rises from the northeast corner of Kunlun.
The Red Water rises from its southeast corner.
The Liao River rises from Mount Jieshi, flowing east from the northern frontier and emptying into the sea southwest of Liaodong.
The Black Water is in Yongzhou.
The Yangzi River rises from Mount Min in the far west of Shu.
The Huai River rises south of Mount Tongbo in Pingyang.

Within the Four Seas, the distance from east to west is twenty-eight thousand *li*, and from south to north, twenty-six thousand *li*. *Zi* and *wu* mark the meridian; *mao* and *you* mark the parallel—thus the meridian is shorter and the parallel longer. The waterways stretch eight thousand *li*, with six hundred named rivers among them. The land routes extend three thousand *li*.

The land routes are slanting paths. *Lu* means "earth." Yu then dispatched Taizhang to pace from the eastern extremity to the western extremity, measuring two hundred million, thirty-three thousand, five hundred *li* and seventy-five *bu*. He sent Shuhai to pace from the northern extremity to the southern extremity, measuring two hundred million, thirty-three thousand, five hundred *li* and seventy-five *bu*. Taizhang and Shuhai were swift walkers, both ministers of Yu. Within the seas, the distance from east to west is shorter, while from south to north it is longer, yet the extremities are equal in measure.

All great floodwaters and deep marshes, from three hundred *ren* upward, extend two hundred million, thirty-three thousand, five hundred and fifty *li*, comprising nine abysses. Yu then used *xi* soil to fill the floodwaters and create famous mountains. *Xi* soil does not diminish; the more it is excavated, the more it multiplies, thus it was used to fill the floodwaters. Famous mountains are great mountains. Digging below the Kunlun Void levels the earth, or in some versions, forms pools.

At its center stands the Ninefold Augmented City, rising eleven thousand *li*, one hundred fourteen *bu*, two *chi*, and six *cun*. The "center" refers to the midst of the Kunlun Void. *Zeng* means "layered." There are Five Cities and Twelve Towers, as recorded in the *Kuodi Xiang*. This account may be fanciful, for in truth, such things are unheard of.

Atop it grows the Wood Grain, reaching five *xun* in height—*xun* being thirty-five *chi*. To its west stand the Pearl Tree, Jade Tree, *Xuan* Tree, and Deathless Tree. To its east grow the *Shatang* and *Langgan*, both names of jade. One version holds that *Shatang* is a tree name. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: "Of fruits most excellent, the fruit of the *Shatang*." To its south stands the Crimson Tree—*jiang* meaning "red." To its north stand the Jasper Tree and *Yao* Tree—*bi* meaning "blue-green jade." These lie north of the Wood Grain.

Surrounding it are four hundred forty gates, with ten gates on each side. Between gates lie four *li*, and between *li* lie nine *chun*—each *chun* measuring one *zhang* and five *chi*. *Chun* is a unit of measure. Alongside stand nine jade wells, linked at the northwest corner. *Heng* means "radiant." In some versions, *heng* is written as *peng*, referring to the vessel that holds the elixir of immortality.

The northern gate opens to admit the wind from Buzhou. There are the Inclined Palace and the Rotating Chamber—the Inclined Palace fills a *xu* when at its center. The Rotating Chamber is adorned with rotating jade. One version holds that the chamber’s *xuanji* lock can turn, hence its name. The Suspended Garden, Cool Breeze, and *Fantong* lie within the Kunlun’s *Changhe* gate. *Changhe* is the name of the Kunlun Void’s gate. The Suspended Garden, Cool Breeze, and *Fantong* are all names of Kunlun’s mountains. *Fan* is pronounced like the *fan* in "barley meal." This is its vegetable garden.

The pool of the vegetable garden is irrigated by the Yellow Water, which encircles it thrice before returning to its source. The source is its origin. This is called the Cinnabar Water, and drinking it grants immortality.

The Yellow River emerges from the northeast corner of Kunlun, passes through the Bohai Sea, and enters the Jishi Mountain, where Yu dredged it. The Bohai is the great sea. The Yellow River flows underground from Kunlun, and Yu dredged it to make it passable, reaching Jishi Mountain. The *Book* states: "The River issues from Jishi." Here, "enters" means "exits."

The Red Water emerges from its southeast corner and flows southwest into the southern sea, east of the Cinnabar Marsh. East of the Red Water, the Weak Water issues from Qiongshi—Qiongshi being a mountain name in Zhangye, a northern frontier waterway. It reaches Heli, and its remnant waves enter the Flowing Sands, crossing the Flowing Sands to reach the southern sea. *Jue* means "to pass." The Flowing Sands flow onward.

The Yang Water emerges from its northwest corner and enters the southern sea south of the Feathered People. The Yang Water passes through the Lintao Shidao, east to Wudu, where it becomes Hanyang. In some versions, it is written as *Yangshui*. These four waters are the divine springs of the Thearch, used to harmonize the hundred medicines and moisten the myriad things.

The Kunlun Mound may be twice as high—if it is ten thousand *li* tall, doubling it makes twenty thousand *li*. This is called the Cool Breeze Mountain, and ascending it grants immortality. Doubling its height again, it is called the Suspended Garden, and ascending it grants numinous power, able to summon wind and rain. Doubling it once more, it reaches the heavens above, and ascending it grants divinity. This is the abode of the Supreme Thearch. The Supreme Thearch is the Heavenly Thearch.

The Fusang Tree stands in Yangzhou, where the sun shines. Fusang is the *fusang* tree, south of the Tang Valley. *Bi* means "to illuminate." Passing through Yangzhou, the east. *Bi* is pronounced like the *zhi* in "leafless branch." The Upright Tree stands in Duguan—its form resembles life, and pulling it reveals bark like a yellow-green snake’s, with leaves like a net. Duguan is a mountain name in the south. The myriad thearchs ascend and descend from here. At noon, there is no shadow, and a call echoes without direction, for this is the center of heaven and earth. The thearchs ascend to heaven and descend from Duguan Mountain, hence "ascend and descend." At noon, the sun stands directly overhead, casting no shadow, thus it is called the center of heaven and earth.

The Ruo Tree stands west of the Upright Tree, its tip bearing ten suns, whose blossoms illuminate the earth below. The "tip" is its end. The Ruo Tree’s end holds ten suns, shaped like lotus blossoms. *Hua* means "light," which shines upon the earth below.

The greatness of the Nine Provinces spans a pure square of a thousand *li*. *Chun* means "edge," and is also a unit of measure. Beyond the Nine Provinces lie the Eight *Yin*, each also a thousand-*li* square. *Yin* means "distant." *Yin* is pronounced like *yin* in "descendant."

To the northeast lies the Great Marsh, called Wutong. The Great Marsh and Wutong are both marsh names. To the east lies the Great Islet, called the Lesser Sea. An islet is land amid water. The east is water-rich, hence the Lesser Sea, also a marsh name. To the southeast lies Juyu, called Yuanzhe. *Yuan* is pronounced like the *xue* in "uncle" as spoken by the people of Changshan. To the south lie the Great Dream and the Vast Marsh.

"Dream" refers to Yunmeng. *Hao* also means "great." To the southwest lies Zhuzi, called Danzé. As it is near the Dan River, it takes its name, hence Danzé. To the west lie the Nine Regions, called Quanzé. To the northwest lies Daxia, called Haizé. To the north lies Daming, called Hanzé. The north abounds in cold waters, hence Hanzé.

The eight *Yin* and eight marshes are said to "rain upon the Nine Provinces." Beyond the eight *Yin* lie the Eight *Xian*. *Xian* means "cord" or "tie," binding heaven and earth as their boundary, hence *Xian*. Each is also a thousand-*li* square:

To the northeast lies Heqiu, called Huangtu. Where the phoenix sings and the *luan* dances, it is named Heqiu and Huangtu. To the east lies Jilin, called Sangye. To the southeast lies Daqiong, called Zhongnü. To the south lies Duguang, called Fanhù. Duguang is a kingdom’s name. The mountain lies within this land, thus also called Duguang Mountain. As it lies south of the homeland, all doors face north, hence "reversed doors." To the southwest lies Jiaoyao, called Yantu. Jiaoyao is the land of short people, who stand less than three *chi* in fear. To the west lies Jinqiu, called Woye. The west is the position of metal, hence Jinqiu. *Wo* means "white," and the west is white, hence Woye. To the northwest lies Yimu, called Shasuo. The people of this land have one eye, centered on the face. Shasuo is where flowing sands arise, also said to be a marsh name. To the north lies Jibing, called Weiyu. The north is where cold ice gathers, thus taking its name. Jibing means "accumulated ice." Weiyu is a mountain name, lying at the northern pole where the sun is never seen.

The *qi* of the Eight *Xian* issues forth cold and heat, aligning with the Eight *Zheng* through wind and rain. The Eight *Zheng* are the proper winds of the eight directions, bringing wind and rain within the Eight *Xian*. Beyond the Eight *Xian* lie the Eight *Ji*:

To the northeast lies Fangtu Mountain, called Cang Gate. As wood governs the northeast, it is the beginning of sound, hence Cang Gate. To the east lies Dongji Mountain, called the Gate of Opening Light. *Ming* means "yang," where the sun rises, hence the Gate of Opening Light. To the southeast lies Bomu Mountain, called Yang Gate. In the southeast, the lunar station is *si*, where pure yang governs, hence Yang Gate. All cities’ southeast corner gates are Yang Gates, of this kind. To the south lies Nanji Mountain, called Shu Gate. The south is the height of yang, where warmth accumulates, hence Shu Gate. To the southwest lies Bianju Mountain, called Bai Gate. In the southwest, the lunar station is *shen*, the beginning of metal *qi*. Metal *qi* is white, hence Bai Gate. To the west lies Xiji Mountain, called the Gate of Changhe. In the west, the eighth month’s lunar station is *you*, when all things reach completion and are ready for harvest. *Chang* means "great."

*He* means "to close." The great gathering of the myriad things is enclosed, hence the Gate of Changhe. To the northwest lies Buzhou Mountain, called the Gate of Youdu. *You* means "enclosed," and *du* means "gathered." As Xuanming (Dark and Frozen) *qi* begins to take effect, following yin to gather, it is called the Gate of Youdu. To the north lies Beiji Mountain, called the Gate of Han. It is where cold accumulates, hence the Gate of Han.

The clouds of the Eight Poles bring rain to the world; the winds of the Eight Gates regulate cold and heat. The clouds of the Eight Strings, Eight Borders, and Eight Marshes rain upon the Nine Provinces and harmonize the Central Land. The Central Land is Jizhou.

The finest of the east is found in the *xunyuqi* jade of Yiwulü. Yiwulü is a mountain name, located in Liaodong’s dependent state. *Xunyuqi* is the name of a jade. The finest of the southeast is found in the bamboo arrows of Kuaiji. Kuaiji Mountain lies south of present-day Shanyin County in Kuaiji, where Yu was buried. Bamboo arrows are the fine bamboo arrows produced in the Kuaiji region today. The finest of the south is found in the rhinoceros and elephant of Liang Mountain. Liang Mountain is in Kuaiji. In Changsha and south of the Xiang River, rhinoceros horn and elephant tusk are treasures of these creatures. The finest of the southwest is found in the metals and stones of Mount Hua. *Metal* refers to fine metal; *stone* refers to stone containing jade. Mount Hua is present-day Mount Hua south of Huayin in Hongnong. The finest of the west is found in the pearls and jades of Mount Huo. It produces luminous pearls and jade of jade color. This is present-day Yong’an County in Hedong. The finest of the northwest is found in the *qiulin* and *langgan* of Kunlun. *Qiulin* and *langgan* are both fine jades. The finest of the north is found in the sinews and horns of Youdu. Ancient Youdu lay north of Yingmen; its livestock were suited to cattle, sheep, and horses, and it produced fine sinews and horns for making bows and crossbows. The finest of the northeast is found in the patterned hides of Chi Mountain. *Chi* is read as in "Chiqiu." *Patterned hides* are the pelts of leopards and tigers. As the tradition states: "The son of Wu Zhong sent Meng Le through Wei Zhuangzi to present leopard and tiger pelts in order to seek peace with the Rong tribes." The finest of the center is found in Mount Tai, which produces the Five Grains, mulberry, hemp, fish, and salt. Mount Tai is Mount Dai. It is where kings perform the feng and shan sacrifices at the change of dynasties, hence called Mount Dai. The Five Grains, mulberry, hemp, fish, and salt are what nourish the people. *Produces* means "grows."

In general, the earth’s forms: east-west is *wei* (latitude), north-south is *jing* (longitude). Mountains accumulate virtue; rivers accumulate punishment. Mountains are benevolent, for the myriad things are born there, hence they accumulate virtue. Rivers are wise, and wisdom makes judgments, hence they accumulate punishment. As the *Analects* says: "The benevolent delight in mountains; the wise delight in water."

The high are for life; the low are for death. The high are yang and govern life; the low are yin and govern death. Hills are male; valleys are female. Hills are lofty and open, yang, hence male. Valleys are low and sunken, yin, hence female. Where water bends in circles, there are pearls; where it bends in squares, there is jade. Circular bends are yang. Pearls are yang within yin. Square bends are yin. Jade is yin within yang. All follow their kind.

Clear waters contain yellow gold; dragon pools contain *yuying* jade. Clear waters are limpid, hence yellow gold is found there. Dragon pools are where dragons emerge and roam. *Yuying* jade transforms, possessing luminous essence. Lands each produce according to their kind. Thus, mountain *qi* yields many males; marsh *qi* yields many females; barrier *qi* yields many dull-witted; wind *qi* yields many deaf; forest *qi* yields many infirm; wood *qi* yields many hunchbacked. From this point up to "mountain *qi* yields many males," all refer to children born with these conditions. Shore *qi* yields many swollen; stone *qi* yields many strong, like the hardness of stone. Perilous *qi* yields many goiters, for the *qi* of perilous heights and depths surges into the throat and congeals, causing many goiters and throat ailments. Heat *qi* yields many who die young, their lives cut short. Cold *qi* yields many long-lived. Valley *qi* yields many with numbness. Hill *qi* yields many mad. Floodplain *qi* yields many benevolent, for floodplains are low and marshy. Mound *qi* yields many greedy. Light soils yield quickness; heavy soils yield slowness. *Quickness* means swiftness.

Clear waters have soft sounds; turbid waters have loud sounds. *Sounds* refer to voices. Swift waters yield light people; slow waters yield heavy people. *Swift* refers to rushing, violent waters. The Central Land yields many sages. All reflect their *qi*; all correspond to their kind.

Thus, in the south there are grasses that never die, while in the north there is ice that never melts. The south is warm, so its grasses never perish; the north is cold, so its ice never thaws. In the east lies the Land of Gentlemen, for the east is ruled by the virtue of wood, which is benevolence, hence the Land of Gentlemen. Its people wear robes, caps, and swords, and eat the flesh of beasts, employing two striped tigers as attendants.

In the west lie corpses with mutilated forms. When one sleeps and dwells, dreams come directly—when a person dies, they become a ghost. The west is governed by metal, and metal is associated with cutting, severing, and warfare, hence the corpses with mutilated forms. *Qin* means sleep; *ju* means dwelling. The *qi* of metal is unyielding and strong, so in sleep and dwelling, dreams are vivid and direct, thus called "direct dreams." Those who do not live out their allotted years die and become ghosts, capable of bringing demonic afflictions upon people. Another account says: the mutilated corpses there have their two breasts as eyes and their navels as mouths, wielding shields and axes in dance. The Celestial Spirits sever their hands, and the Supreme Emperor later severs their heads—hence their sleep and dwelling yield direct dreams.

Magnetite soars upward, mica draws water, earthen dragons summon rain, and swallows and geese take turns in flight. When Tang suffered drought, he fashioned earthen dragons to resemble true dragons. Clouds follow dragons, thus bringing rain. Swallows, the dark birds, arrive at the spring equinox, while geese at the spring equinox fly north to the deserts. Swallows depart at the autumn equinox, and geese at the autumn equinox fly south to Pengli Marsh—hence they "take turns in flight." *Dai* means alternation.

Clams, crabs, pearls, and turtles wax and wane with the moon. *Yu* means to follow. Therefore, people of firm soils are resolute; those of weak soils are plump; those of loamy soils are large; those of sandy soils are fine. *Lu* is read as the *lu* in *lu sheng* (hempen rope). *Xi* means small. People of fertile soils are comely; those of barren soils are unsightly.

Those who drink water are skilled swimmers and endure the cold—such are fish, turtles, ducks, and egrets. Those who eat earth have no hearts yet are clever—such are earthworms. Those who eat wood are strong and fierce—such are bears and brown bears. *Bi* refers to the yellow markings of the intestines; *bi* is read as the *bi* in *nei bi gan zhong guo* (internal distress in the Central Land), near the nose. Those who eat grass are swift but foolish—such are elk and deer. Those who eat leaves produce silk—such are moths and silkworms. Those who eat meat are brave and fierce—such are tigers, leopards, eagles, and goshawks. Those who consume *qi* are spiritually enlightened and long-lived—such are the immortals Peng and Wang. Those who eat grain are intelligent but short-lived; those who eat nothing do not die and become spirits.

All people, birds, beasts, and the myriad creatures, including the *zhen* insects, each have their means of life. *Zhen* insects refer to all small creatures with slender waists. Some are odd, some even; some fly, some walk—none know their true nature. Only those who comprehend the Dao can trace their origins.

Heaven is one, Earth is two, and Man is three. One is yang; two is yin. Humans are born of Heaven and Earth, hence called three. Three threes make nine, and nine nines make eighty-one. One governs the sun, and the sun’s number is ten—ten spans from *jia* to *gui*. The sun governs humanity, so humans are born after ten months. Eight nines are seventy-two, two governs the even, and the even supports the odd. The odd governs the celestial stems, the stems govern the moon, the moon governs horses, so horses are born after twelve months. Seven nines are sixty-three, three governs the Dipper, the Dipper governs dogs, so dogs are born after three months. Six nines are fifty-four, four governs the seasons, the seasons govern swine, so swine are born after four months. Five nines are forty-five, five governs sound, sound governs apes, so apes are born after five months. Four nines are thirty-six, six governs the pitch pipes, the pipes govern elk and deer, so elk and deer are born after six months. Three nines are twenty-seven, seven governs the stars, the stars govern tigers, so tigers are born after seven months. Two nines are eighteen, eight governs the wind, the wind governs insects, so insects transform after eight months.

Birds and fish are born of yin, and yin belongs to yang, so birds and fish are all born from eggs. Fish swim in water, birds fly in clouds, thus at the onset of winter, swallows and sparrows enter the sea and transform into clams. The myriad creatures are born, each of distinct kinds: silkworms eat but do not drink, cicadas drink but do not eat, mayflies neither drink nor eat. Those with shells and scales eat in summer and hibernate in winter. *Jie* refers to armor, such as turtles and softshell turtles; *lin* refers to scales, such as fish and dragons. Those that gnaw and swallow have eight orifices and are born from eggs—such are birds and fish. Those that chew and swallow have nine orifices and are born from wombs—such are four-legged creatures. Those with horns lack upper teeth; those without horns are fat in the front. *Gao* refers to pigs and such; *xiong* and *yuan* (bears and gibbons) are fat in the front. Those with horns are lean in the back—such are oxen, sheep, and elk. *Wu hou* means fat accumulates in the rear.

Those born by day resemble their fathers; those born by night resemble their mothers. Extreme yin gives birth to females; extreme yang gives birth to males. Bears and brown bears hibernate in seclusion; birds migrate with the seasons.

Thus, white waters suit jade; black waters suit whetstones—whetstones are fine stones. Blue waters suit jasper; red waters suit cinnabar; yellow waters suit gold; clear waters suit turtles. The muddy Fen River suits hemp; the harmonious Ji River suits wheat; the moderately turbid Yellow River suits beans; the light and swift Luo River suits millet; the strong Wei River suits glutinous millet; the heavy and calm Han River suits bamboo; the fertile and benevolent Yangtze suits rice. People of level lands are clever and suited to the five grains.

As the tradition states: "North of Ji, the land where horses are born," referring to Yan and Dai as horse-producing regions. The center is where all four directions converge, where winds and qi circulate, and where rain and dew gather. Its people have broad faces and short jaws, fine beards but dislike obesity. Their orifices connect to the mouth, and their skin and flesh belong there. Their complexion is yellow, governing the stomach. They are wise and sagely, fond of governance. Their lands suit millet and abound in cattle, sheep, and the six livestock.

Wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood. Thus, millet sprouts in spring and withers in autumn—millet belongs to wood, thriving when wood prevails in spring and perishing when metal prevails in autumn. Beans sprout in summer and die in winter—beans belong to fire, thriving when fire prevails in summer and perishing when water prevails in winter. Wheat sprouts in autumn and dies in summer—wheat belongs to metal, thriving when metal prevails and perishing when fire prevails. Watercress sprouts in winter and dies in midsummer—watercress belongs to water, thriving when water prevails and perishing when earth prevails.

Wood flourishes when water ages, fire is born when wood ages, metal is imprisoned when fire ages, and earth dies when metal ages. Fire flourishes when wood ages, earth is born when fire ages, water is imprisoned when earth ages, and metal dies when water ages. Earth flourishes when fire ages, metal is born when earth ages, wood is imprisoned when metal ages, and water dies when wood ages. Metal flourishes when earth ages, water is born when metal ages, fire is imprisoned when water ages, and wood dies when fire ages. Water flourishes when metal ages, wood is born when water ages, earth is imprisoned when wood ages, and fire dies when earth ages.

Sound has five notes, with *gong* as their ruler. The five notes are *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*. *Gong* stands at the center, hence its primacy. Color has five hues, with yellow as their ruler. Taste has five transformations, with sweetness as their ruler. The five phases have earth as their ruler.

Thus, refining earth generates wood, refining wood generates fire, refining fire generates clouds—clouds arise from the qi of metal. Refining clouds generates water, and refining water returns to earth. Refining sweetness generates sourness, refining sourness generates acridity, refining acridity generates bitterness, refining bitterness generates saltiness, and refining saltiness returns to sweetness. *Lian* means "to refine" or "to cultivate."

Transforming *gong* generates *zhi*, transforming *zhi* generates *shang*, transforming *shang* generates *yu*, transforming *yu* generates *jiao*, and transforming *jiao* returns to *gong*. *Bian* means "to transform." Thus, water harmonizes with earth, earth harmonizes with fire, fire transforms metal, metal governs wood, and wood returns to earth. The five phases govern one another to

**Shi Ze Xun (On the Standards of the Seasons), Part One**

*Shi* means "standard"—the constant laws of the four seasons, cold and heat, and the twelve months. Hence it is called *Shi Ze*, and the chapter is titled accordingly.

In the first month of spring, the *Zhaoyao* points to *yin*.
*Zhaoyao* refers to the Dipper’s handle.

At dusk, *Shen* culminates; at dawn, *Wei* culminates.
*Shen* is the western White Tiger constellation, which at dusk stands at the meridian in the south.
*Wei* is the eastern Azure Dragon constellation, which at dawn stands at the meridian in the south.

Its position is the east; its days are *jia-yi*. The flourishing power resides in wood, and the spirit of Taihao governs the east.
*Jia-yi* are the days of wood. The flourishing power resides in wood, for wood reigns in the east.

Its creatures are scaled; its tone is *jue*. The east is Lesser Yang, and beings depart from Great Yin.
*Jia* disperses, and dispersion gives rise to scales. The scaled creatures are led by the dragon.
*Jue* is wood, whose position is in the east.

The pitch standard is *Tai Cou*; its number is eight.
The *lü* are the notes of the pitch pipes. As Yin wanes and Yang arises, the myriad things sprout from the earth in *Tai Cou*, hence the name. Its number is eight: in the five phases, wood is third, hence eight.

Its flavor is sour; its scent is rank.
Wood’s flavor is sour. *Suan* ("sour") means "to bore," for the myriad things bore through the earth to emerge.
*Shan* is the rank scent of wood.

Its sacrifice is at the door; the offering precedes the spleen.
Hibernating creatures first stir and emerge through the door, hence the sacrifice at the door. The spleen belongs to earth; when arranging the sacrificial vessels, the spleen is placed foremost. Spring wood overcomes earth, indicating the regular consumption of what it conquers. Another interpretation: the spleen belongs to wood, which employs its own organ.

The east wind thaws the ice; hibernating creatures begin to stir and revive.
The east is wood, mother of fire. As the qi warms, the east wind melts the frozen ice.
*Zhen* means "to move"; *su* means "to live."

Fish rise bearing ice on their backs; otters sacrifice fish.
In this month, carp respond to the Yang and stir, rising with ice on their backs. Otters are aquatic mammals. In this month, otters arrange carp at the water’s edge on all sides, calling it the "sacrifice of fish."

The wild geese head north.
This is the seasonal sign: geese come from Pengli, pass north through Zhou and Luo, and reach Hanzhong to lay eggs and hatch their young.

The Son of Heaven wears azure robes, rides a blue-green dragon, and carries azure jade.
According to the *Zhou Rituals*, a horse seven *chi* or taller is called a "dragon."
He bears azure jade and raises a green banner.
*Fu* means "to wear." The bear and tiger are emblems of the banner.

He eats wheat and mutton.
Wheat is the grain of metal; mutton is the livestock of earth. In this month, metal and earth are aged, so he eats what they conquer. He first eats wheat, making it the staple.

He drinks the water of the eight winds and cooks with fire from *qi* wood.
He collects dew from a bronze basin—water blown by the winds of the eight directions—and drinks it. He cooks with fire kindled from *qi* wood.
*Qi* is read as *gaibei* ("all-encompassing").

The palace ladies of the Eastern Palace wear green, don green silks, and play the zither and se.
The zither and *se* are of wood. As wood reigns in spring, they play them.

Their weapon is the spear.
The spear has a sharp point, resembling the myriad things boring through the earth to emerge.

Their livestock is the sheep.
Sheep belong to earth, mother of wood, hence they are raised.

They hold court at the left hall of Qingshang to issue the spring decrees.
On the first day of the month, the Son of Heaven faces east in the left hall of Qingshang to greet the sun. The east-facing hall is called Qingshang; the northern chamber is called the "left decree." *Jin* means "to separate." The spring decrees are those of leniency and harmony.

They spread virtue and bestow kindness, enact rewards, and reduce corvée and taxes.
They spread the Yang virtue and bestow gentle kindness. *Qing* means "goodness"; *shang* means "to grant." They lessen the labor of corvée and lighten taxes.

On the day of *Lichun*, the Son of Heaven personally leads the Three Dukes, the Nine Ministers, and the great officers to welcome the year in the eastern suburbs.
*Shuai* means "to lead." To "welcome the year" is to [meet] spring. The eastern suburbs lie eight *li* beyond the outer walls.

They repair the altars and arrange the sacrificial positions, present jade and silk to pray to the spirits, and use male animals as sacrificial victims.
The "sacrificial positions" are the altars and screened enclosures. *Bi* are jade tablets and silk. To "pray to the spirits" is to seek blessings. Spirits of humans are called *gui*; spirits of heaven are called *shen*. Male victims are used to emphasize purity.

They forbid the felling of trees.
In spring, wood reigns and should be nurtured, hence the prohibition.

They forbid the overturning of nests, the killing of pregnant animals or fledglings, the taking of fawns or eggs.
"Pregnant animals" are those carrying young not yet born. The young of elk are called *yao*; those of deer are called *min*. Eggs not yet hatched are also forbidden to be taken, to foster the flourishing of the myriad things.

They forbid the assembling of crowds or the building of city walls, and order the burial of exposed bones.
They forbid the gathering of large crowds or the construction of city walls, which would hinder agricultural work. *Ge* are bones with flesh; they are to be covered and buried to respect the vitality of life.

If in the first month of spring the summer decrees are followed, then wind and rain will not be timely, grasses and trees will wither early, and the state will be filled with fear.
In the first month of spring, the power of wood is in effect. If one follows the fiery energy of summer above, grasses and trees will wither prematurely, and the state will be gripped by terror.

If the autumn decrees are followed, then the people will suffer great epidemics, violent winds and torrential rains will arrive together, and weeds and brambles will flourish.
Spring is mild and benevolent, but the autumn decrees are those of the metal axe. If the qi are not harmonious, the people will suffer epidemics, and winds and rains will come in haste. Hence weeds and brambles—coarse and foul grasses—will flourish.

If the winter decrees are followed, then floods will cause ruin, frost and great hail will strike, and the first harvests will not be gathered.
In spring, the Yang qi should rise, but if the Yin qi of winter prevails, floods will wreak havoc, frost and hail will fall heavily, and the early crops will fail.

Winter is Yin, and the springs surge forth—if spring’s decrees are enacted then, ruin will follow. The qi are not harmonious, hence great hail and heavy frost fall, and the crops do not ripen.

In the first month, the office of *Sikong* presides, and its tree is the poplar. The *Sikong* governs earth, and in spring the earth receives the fine harvest, hence the office of *Sikong*. The *Erya* states: "The poplar is the *puliuliu*." The poplar flourishes in spring’s light, hence its tree is the poplar.

In the second spring month, the *Zhaoyao* star points to *mao*, the *Hu* star culminates at dusk, and the *Jianxing* star culminates at dawn. The *Hu* star lies south of *Yugui*; this month, it culminates in the south at dusk. The *Jianxing* star lies above the Dipper; this month, it culminates in the south at dawn. Its position is the east, its days are *jia* and *yi*, its creatures are scaled, its tone is *jiao*, and its pitch is *Jiazhong*. This month, the myriad things leave Yin and embrace Yang, gathering upon the earth to grow—hence it is called *Jiazhong*. Its number is eight, its flavor is sour, its scent is rank, its sacrifice is at the door, and the spleen is offered first.

The rains begin, and the peach and plum trees first blossom. From winter’s ice and snow to this spring’s equinox and grain rains, hence it is called "the rains begin," and the peach and plum trees all bloom. The *canggeng* sings, and the hawk transforms into the turtledove. The *canggeng*—the *Erya* calls it *shanggeng* or *lihuang*, the Chu sparrow. The Qi people call it *bozhu*, the Qin call it *huangliuli*, and in You and Ji it is called the yellow bird. Another account says it is the woodpecker, which sings in this month. The hawk transforms into the turtledove, its beak straight and no longer predatory. The turtledove is the cuckoo.

The Son of Heaven wears blue-green robes, rides a green dragon chariot, adorns himself with azure jade, raises a blue-green banner, eats wheat and mutton, drinks the water of the eight winds, and cooks with fire drilled from wood. The women of the Eastern Palace wear blue-green, dress in blue-green hues, and play the zither and se. Their weapon is the spear, their livestock is the sheep, and they hold court in the *Qingyang* ancestral temple. The ancestral temple faces east, its hall at the center.

He commands his officials to inspect the prisons, remove fetters and shackles, forbid flogging and torture, and halt litigation. The prison is the husband’s chamber. To inspect it is to pardon minor offenses. That which binds the feet is called *zhi*, and that which binds the hands is called *gu*. To forbid flogging and torture is to say they are not used. *Zhi* means to prohibit. Nurture the young, care for the orphaned and solitary, and ensure the sprouts flourish. Follow the spring Yang to foster the young and make them abundant. One without a father is called orphaned, and one without children is called solitary. To care for them is to honor the Yang qi. Thus, if grasses and trees do not sprout, it is because [the Yang qi is not revered].

Choose an auspicious day and command the people to perform the *she* sacrifice. *Yuan* is the chief of virtues. The days run from *jia* to *gui*. The *she* is for praying on behalf of the people; to avoid inauspicious days, one speaks of choosing an auspicious one.

In this month, day and night are equal, thunder first sounds, and hibernating creatures all stir and revive. *Fen* means equal. In winter, Yin is closed and firm, and thunder lies dormant; this month, Yang rises, and thunder first sounds. *Xian* means all. *Dongsu* means to live. Three days before the thunder, ring the bell to announce to the people: "Thunder is about to sound." The *duo* is a wooden bell with a metal mouth and wooden tongue, used to proclaim to the myriad people. *Zhao* means a great number. *Qie* means "will."

Those who fail to restrain their bearing and conduct will bear incomplete children, and misfortune and disaster will surely follow. Those who couple amid thunder and lightning will bear children afflicted with muteness, deafness, seminal incontinence, idiocy, or madness—hence it is said that incompleteness brings misfortune and disaster.

Command the officials to standardize the markets, unify measures and weights, calibrate scales and stone weights, and level pecks and steelyards. *Du* refers to lengths—*zhang* and *chi*. *Liang* refers to volumes—*fu* and *zhong*. *Jun* means "equal." *Hengshi* refers to weighing stones, with one hundred twenty *jin* making one *shi*. *Jiao* means "level." *Doucheng* are measuring vessels. Rectify weights and measures: *duan* means "correct," and *gai* means "level."

Do not drain rivers and marshes, do not dredge ponds and pools, and do not burn mountains and forests, for these would prematurely exhaust creatures and annihilate species. Do not undertake great affairs that would hinder agricultural work. Great affairs refer to military campaigns and punitive expeditions, which harm the people’s farming.

In sacrifices, do not use animal victims but instead offer *gui* jades and *bi* disks, substituting hides and silk. This month values life and growth, so animal victims are not used. *Geng* means "substitute," replacing victims with *gui*, *bi*, hides, and silk. *Pi* refers to deer hides, and *bi* refers to black and reddish-brown bundled silk. As the *Liji* states, "Silk, jade, and hides are presented to announce at the ancestral temple."

If autumnal ordinances are enacted in mid-spring, the state will suffer great floods, cold air will converge in abundance, and hostile armies will invade. Mid-spring is the height of Yang; Yang qi fosters growth, yet if autumn’s punitive and destructive ordinances are enacted, cold air will rush in, and enemy forces will invade the state. If winter ordinances are enacted, Yang qi will not prevail, wheat will fail to ripen, and the people will turn on one another. Enacting winter’s Yin ordinances in mid-spring causes Yin to overpower Yang; thus Yang fails, wheat does not mature, and the people become predatory. If summer ordinances are enacted, the state will suffer severe drought, warmth will arrive prematurely, and insects and borers will cause harm. Enacting summer’s extreme Yang ordinances in mid-spring brings great drought, and excessive heat causes warmth to peak. Yang generates Yin, so insects and borers emerge to wreak havoc. *Ming* refers to insects that eat the heart.

In the second month, the Granary Official oversees the planting of apricot trees. The second month sees the start of farming and grain sowing, hence the Granary Official’s role. The apricot has a cavity at its center, symbolizing Yin’s dissemination above—thus apricot trees are planted.

In the third month of spring, the *zhaoyao* star points to *chen*, the Seven Stars culminate at dusk, and the Herdboy culminates at dawn. The Seven Stars are the southern Vermilion Bird’s lodgings; this month, they culminate in the south at dusk. The Herdboy is the northern Dark Warrior’s lodging; this month, it culminates in the south at dawn. Its position is the east, its days are *jia* and *yi*, its creatures are scaled, its note is *jue*, and its pitch pipe is *Guxi*. *Gu* means "old," and *xi* means "new." This month, Yang nurtures life, casting off the old and embracing the new—hence *Guxi*. Its number is eight, its flavor is sour, its scent is rank, its sacrifice is at the door, and the spleen is first offered. The paulownia begins to bloom, and the field mouse transforms into the *ru* bird. The paulownia is the *wutong*; this month, it blooms. The field mouse is the mole rat. The *ru* is the quail; in Qing and Xu, it is called *mou*, while in You and Ji, it is called *chun*. The rainbow first appears, and duckweed begins to grow. The rainbow is the *didi*. As the *Odes* says, "The *didi* appears in the east—none dare point at it." Duckweed is aquatic algae; this month, it begins to grow.

The Son of Heaven wears azure robes, rides a blue-green dragon chariot, adorns himself with azure jade, raises a blue-green banner, eats wheat and mutton, drinks the Eight Winds’ water, and cooks with fire from *qi* kindling. The Eastern Palace’s consorts wear azure, dress in azure hues, and play zithers and sevens-stringed instruments. Their weapon is the spear, their sacrificial animal is the sheep, and they hold court in the eastern Bright Hall’s right chamber. The hall faces east, with the southern chamber at its head—hence the "right chamber."

The Boat Overseer overturns the boat five times, inspecting it five times, before presenting it to the Son of Heaven. The Boat Overseer is the official in charge of boats. This month, the Son of Heaven will board a boat to fish, so it is overturned and examined repeatedly to check for leaks. Five overturnings and five inspections show utmost caution. The Son of Heaven first boards the boat in safety, offers sturgeon at the temple and sleeping chambers, and prays for wheat’s fruition. *Niao* means "peaceful"; from winter until now, he boards the boat in safety—hence "first boarding." *Jian* means "present." The sturgeon resembles a carp but is larger. This fish is presented at the temple and sleeping chambers to beseech ancestral spirits for wheat’s fruition. The front is the temple, and the rear is the sleeping chamber. As the *Odes* says, "Temple and sleeping chamber, grand and connected."

This month, vital qi flourishes, and Yang qi disperses—*faxie* means "to disseminate." All curled creatures emerge, and all sprouts reach forth; nothing should be repressed. The Son of Heaven commands officials to open granaries and storehouses, aid the poor and destitute, and relieve the exhausted and cut off. Those without wealth are called poor, while the widowed, orphaned, childless, and solitary are called destitute. *Zhen* means "to rescue." Open treasuries and bring forth silk and cloth to send envoys to the feudal lords. Treasuries store silk and cloth; envoys are sent to pay respects to the feudal lords. Summon renowned scholars and honor the worthy. Those with renowned virtue and great worth are summoned and honored, to be employed in governance.

Command the Minister of Works: as timely rains approach, water below rises and mist above ascends. Patrol the capital and its outskirts, surveying the plains and fields. The Minister of Works oversees water and earth. This month, as water below rises and mist above ascends, there is concern for flooding that could harm the five grains—hence patrolling and surveying. Broad and flat lands are called *yuan*, and the outskirts are called *ye*. Repair and reinforce dikes, dredge and clear ditches, and open roads, beginning in the capital and ending at the borders.

End hunting with nets and arrows, and remove snares, traps, and poisonous drugs from the nine gates. *Bi* are covering nets, and *yi* are arrows with cords. As the *Odes* says, "Shoot teal and wild geese." *Ju* are rabbit nets. As the *Odes* says, "Swiftly the rabbit nets are set." *Bi* and *luo* are bird nets. As the *Odes* says, "Mandarin ducks in the *fu*—net them, snare them." *Fu* is the general term for deer nets.

The Son of Heaven’s city has twelve gates. The three eastern gates are where the royal *qi* resides, and from these gates, poisonous drugs for slaying beasts must not be allowed to exit—this is to uphold life and nurture. Though the remaining nine gates permit their passage, they are expressly forbidden, as if they were not to leave at all.

Wild wardens are then commanded not to fell mulberry or *tuo* trees. Mulberry and *tuo* both serve to rear silkworms, hence the people are forbidden to cut them down. The turtledove spreads its wings, and the shrike descends upon the mulberry. The turtledove is the bird that swiftly beats its wings, soaring straight upward into the clouds. The *zai shi* is the shrike. As the *Odes* says, *"The shrike is in the mulberry; its young are in the plum."*

Prepare curved baskets and square-bottomed containers. *Pu* means "to hold," and three turns make a *pu*. *Pu* is pronounced like the word for "mountain ridge" in Nanyang speech. *Qu* means "thin," and in Qing and Xu, it is called *qu*. A round-bottomed vessel is called a *ju*, and a square-bottomed one a *kuang*—both are tools for receiving mulberry leaves.

The empress and consorts purify themselves, face east, and personally pluck mulberry leaves, overseeing the women’s work and encouraging sericulture. The Five Armories are ordered to inspect metals, iron, hides, sinews, horns, arrow shafts, tallow, glue, cinnabar, and lacquer—none may be of poor quality.

A propitious day in the last third of the month is chosen to hold a grand musical assembly and foster joy. Music serves to transform customs and shift mores, so a fortunate day is selected for this great gathering to bring about harmony and delight.

Then the finest bulls and stallions are assembled, and mares are released to pasture. *Te* bulls are prime bulls. *Teng* horses are spirited colts that kick up their hooves and excel at leading herds. They are allowed to roam freely among the mares in the grazing lands. *Te* is pronounced like *lei* in "creeping vine."

The state performs the *nuo* exorcism: at the nine gates, dogs are dismembered to dispel inauspicious influences and complete the *qi* of spring. *San* means "to disperse." In the secluded corners and dim recesses of palaces and chambers, drums are beaten and loud cries raised to drive out ill fortune—this is akin to the present-day practice of expelling pestilence. The nine gates refer to the three gates on each of the three sides. Dismembering dogs exhausts the yang *qi*, hence it is said to complete the *qi* of spring.

If the ordinances of this month are followed, sweet rain will fall for thirty days.

If in late spring the ordinances of winter are enacted, cold *qi* will arise at times, grasses and trees will wither, and the state will face great terror. Late spring governed by winter’s killing cold *qi* causes intermittent cold snaps. When plants shed their leaves prematurely, it is called *su*. If the ordinances of summer are enacted, the people will suffer many epidemics, timely rains will not fall, and the hills and mounds will yield no harvest. Late spring governed by summer’s scorching yang *qi* disrupts harmony, leading to disease among the people and drought, so plants fail to mature. If the ordinances of autumn are enacted, the skies will be heavy with gloom, excessive rains will fall prematurely, and warfare will erupt. Autumn is the season when metal *qi* prevails, and metal is the mother of water. When autumn’s *qi* is enacted in late spring, it generates dense yin and excessive rain. Metal governs weapons and war, hence conflicts arise.

In the third month, the office of the district is established, and its tree is the plum. In the third month, the populace’s households are registered, hence the office of the district. The plum, like the apricot, has a pit, and its late ripening places it in the third month.

In the first month of summer, the Big Dipper’s handle points to *si*. At dusk, the Wings constellation culminates, and at dawn, the Woman constellation culminates. The Wings are a constellation of the Vermilion Bird of the south, and this month at dusk, it culminates in the south. The Woman, also called the Serving Maid, is a constellation of the Dark Warrior of the north, and this month at dawn, it culminates in the south.

Its position is the south, its days are *bing* and *ding*, and its supreme virtue resides in fire. The spirit of the Blazing Emperor governs the south. *Bing* and *ding* are fire days. Supreme virtue resides in fire, and fire rules the south. Its creatures are feathered, its note is *zhi*, and flourishing yang prevails as scales disperse. Feathered creatures are led by the phoenix. The *zhi* note corresponds to fire. The pitch pipe *Zhonglü* is attuned, and its number is seven. This month, yang disperses externally while yin solidifies within, thus traveling yang achieves success—hence it is called *Zhonglü*. Its number is seven: the generating number is five, and fire is the second, hence seven.

Its flavor is bitter, its scent is scorched. Fire’s flavor is bitter. Scorched refers to the charred aroma of fire. Its sacrifice is the hearth, and the first offering is the sacrificial meat. Zhu Rong and Wu Hui served as Fire Ministers to Gao Xin, and upon death, they became fire spirits, their worship entrusted to the hearth. As fire rules this month, the hearth is sacrificed to. The sacrificial meat is the sister’s portion. The meat used in sacrifice is first that which overcomes. Alternatively, it is said to be the sister’s fire, using its own store.

Mole crickets chirp, toads emerge, and earthworms appear. The mole cricket is the mole cricket. The *guo* is the toad. In the fourth month, yin *qi* begins to stir below, so these creatures respond by calling. The *qiu yan* is the earthworm.

The royal gourd grows, and sow thistle blooms. The royal gourd is the *guālóu*. The *Erya* states, "That which bears fruit without flowering is called *xiu*." Sow thistle is said to bloom properly. The Son of Heaven wears red robes, rides a red steed, adorns himself with red jade, and raises a red banner—this accords with the virtue of fire. He eats beans and chicken. Beans are those with intact skins. Chicken and beans are both nurtured by fire. He drinks water from the eight winds, cooks with *zhe* wood and fire drilled from it. In the Southern Palace, the imperial consorts wear red, dress in red hues, and play reed pipes and *sheng* flutes. As fire rules the south, they reside in the Southern Palace. Reed pipes and *sheng* flutes are hollow, symbolizing yang, hence they are played. His weapon is the halberd. The halberd has branches and a shaft, symbolizing yang’s dispersion. Alternatively, the halberd may be written as the crossbow. His animal is the chicken.

At dawn, he holds court in the left chamber of the Bright Hall to issue the summer ordinances. The hall faces south, aligning with flourishing yang—hence it is called the Bright Hall. The eastern chamber is called the left chamber. Conducting affairs in this chamber enacts the ordinances of this month. The chicken is a feathered creature, a symbol of yang—hence it is raised.

On the day of the summer solstice, the Son of Heaven personally leads the Three Dukes, the Nine Ministers, and the great officers to welcome the year at the southern suburbs. Welcoming the year means welcoming summer. The southern suburbs lie seven *li* from the city. Upon returning, he bestows rewards, enfeoffs the feudal lords, refines rites and music, and feasts his attendants.

Upon returning from the southern suburbs, he rewards those with merit and enfeoffs them with land and titles. As the tradition states: "Rewards are bestowed in spring and summer, punishments in autumn and winter." He refines rites and music to pacify superiors and govern the people, transforming customs and mores. His attendants are his close ministers.

He commands the Grand Commandant to commend the outstanding, select the worthy and good, and recommend the filial and fraternal. The Grand Commandant is a ministerial office. *Ming* means to order; *zan* means to proclaim. Those with talent surpassing a thousand are called outstanding. Selecting the worthy, good, filial, and fraternal to employ them is not the Grand Commandant’s usual duty, hence he is specially commanded.

He confers ranks and bestows emoluments to assist Heaven’s nurturing and growth, continuing cultivation and elevation without decay or ruin. He forbids earthworks and the felling of great trees. He orders the Wildland Wardens to patrol the fields and marshes, encouraging agriculture and driving away beasts and livestock to prevent them from harming the grain.

The Son of Heaven tastes wheat with pork, first offering it at the ancestral temple. In this month, wheat first ripens, hence pork is used to taste it. The pig is a water creature, suited to wheat. Offering it first at the ancestral temple is the height of filial piety.

He gathers and stores all medicinal herbs, for the withered grasses die. In this month, yang qi reaches its peak, and medicinal herbs mature, hence they are gathered and stored. Withered grasses include *tingli* and the like.

When the wheat harvest arrives, he adjudicates minor crimes and metes out light punishments. In the fourth month, yang qi flourishes above, and by the fifth month, yin qi stirs below—hence it is called the wheat harvest. Adjudicating minor crimes and meting out light punishments accords with the qi of killing.

If in early summer autumn ordinances are enacted, bitter rains will frequently come, the five grains will not flourish, and the people of the four directions will take refuge within the walls. Early summer is the height of yang, when nurturing and growth should be assisted. Enacting the metal qi’s ordinances of killing will bring bitter rains that harm the grain, preventing its flourishing. The people of the four directions will enter the cities and fortresses to defend themselves.

If winter ordinances are enacted, grasses and trees will wither early, followed by great floods that ruin city walls. Enacting winter’s ordinances of cold and closure will cause grasses and trees to wither prematurely, and great floods will destroy the city walls. These are the consequences of violating the proper seasons and their ordinances.

If spring ordinances are enacted, locusts will cause devastation, violent winds will arrive, and flowering grasses will not bear fruit. Early summer should continue cultivation and elevation to assist yang’s nurturing and growth. Enacting spring’s ordinances of opening and soaking will bring locust devastation. Spring is the qi of wood, abundant in wind—hence violent winds will come, preventing flowering grasses from maturing.

In the fourth month, the Office of Fields tends to the peach trees. The fourth month encourages agriculture, hence the Office of Fields. The peach is mentioned alongside the apricot. As the plum ripens later, it is called the fourth-month peach.

In the mid-summer month, the *zhaoyao* points to *wu*, the *kang* culminates at dusk, and the *wei* culminates at dawn. *Kang* is a constellation of the eastern Azure Dragon, culminating in the south at dusk this month. *Wei* is a constellation of the northern Dark Warrior, culminating in the south at dawn this month.

Its position is the south, its days are *bing* and *ding*, its creatures are feathered, its note is *zhi*, its pitch pipe is *Ruibin*. Its number is seven. In this month, yin qi droops below like a host, while yang qi resides above like a guest—hence it is called "establishing the guest." Its flavor is bitter, its scent is scorched. Its sacrifice is the stove, and the lungs are offered first.

When the lesser heat arrives, the mantis is born. The mantis is commonly called the "heavenly horse," also known as *chiyou*; in Yan and Yu, it is called the "great axe." The shrike begins to call, and the mockingbird falls silent. The shrike is the *bailao* bird. In the fifth month, yin qi stirs below, and the shrike, responding to yin at the summer solstice, calls while killing snakes in the trees. As the tradition states: "The Bo Zhao clan governs the solstice." The mockingbird is the hundred-tongued bird, able to twist its tongue and alter its voice to mimic the calls of a hundred birds—hence it is called the hundred-tongued bird. It falls silent because in the fifth month, yang qi peaks above while faint yin arises below, and the mockingbird, lacking yin, is thus voiceless.

The Son of Heaven wears red robes, rides a red steed, adorns himself with red jade, carries a red banner, eats beans and chicken, and drinks the water of the eight winds. He cooks with jujube and catalpa firewood. The women of the Southern Palace wear red, dressed in red hues. They play the *yu* and *sheng*. His weapon is the halberd, his animal the chicken. He holds court at the Bright Hall’s ancestral temple. The temple is the south-facing hall’s central chamber.

He commands the Music Masters to repair the drums, *tao* and *pi*, zithers, lutes, flutes, and panpipes, tune the *yu* and *chi*, and adorn the bells and chimes. The *guan* has one hole, resembling a flute. The *xiao* is today’s song flute. The *chi* is pronounced like the "chi" in "pond." He wields shields, *ge* axes, halberds, and feathered banners. The shield is a *gan*; the *ge* is an axe; the halberd is a type of *ji*. The feathered banner is the *duo* held by warriors.

He commands the officials to pray and sacrifice to the mountains, rivers, and all the plains for the people, and to perform the great *yu* sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor with grand music. The mountains, rivers, and plains of the state that can summon clouds and rain are all prayed to and sacrificed to. The *yu* is a drought sacrifice. The "Supreme" is the Emperor. To pray for rain for the people, grand music is used. Grand music refers to the music of the six dynasties.

The Son of Heaven tastes millet with pheasant. The pheasant is a type of chicken. It is not called "tasting chicken" but "tasting millet" because grain is primary. He offers the cherry, first presenting it at the temple. *Xiu* means to offer. The cherry is what the oriole plucks and eats—hence it is called the "contained cherry." It ripens this month, hence it is offered.

He forbids the people from cutting indigo to dye, as the indigo’s blue is not yet fully developed. He forbids burning ash, for in this month grasses and trees are not yet mature, and one must not prematurely harm things. He forbids exposing cloth to the sun, for fire is fierce—exposing cloth will make it brittle and damaged. Gates and lanes are not closed, and passes and markets are not inspected. Gates are city gates; lanes are village gates. The people follow the yang qi, dispersing and dwelling outside, coming and going freely—hence they are not closed. Gates are strategic points; markets are where people gather. "No inspection" means no taxation. He lightens the burdens of heavy prisoners and increases their food. *Ting* means to ease.

He attends to the widowed and bereaved, providing relief for those who died in service. *Guan* refers to the elderly without wives; *gua* refers to the elderly without husbands—he attends to them all. For those whose ancestors died in service to the state, he aids their descendants. He separates mares from their herds, restrains stallions, and issues equine decrees. In this month, mares’ pregnancies are established, so they are separated from the herds. To prevent stallions from injuring the fetuses with their hooves, they are restrained. *Ban* means to announce; *ma zheng* refers to the officials in charge of horses. *Teng ju* are stallions. According to the *Rites of Zhou*, horses under five *chi* in height are called *ju*.

The days grow short to their limit; yin and yang contend, and life and death diverge. The noble man fasts and abstains, restraining himself from restlessness. He moderates music and sensual pleasures, tempers rich flavors, stills the hundred officials, and ensures no affairs proceed without due process—thus stabilizing the subtle yin’s accomplishments. *"No affairs proceed without due process"* means that later actions must first be deliberated. *Yan yin* refers to subtle yin.

Deer shed their antlers, and cicadas begin to sing. At the summer solstice, deer shed their antlers; cicadas beat their wings and begin to call. *Banxia* sprouts, and *mujin* blooms. *Banxia* is a medicinal herb. *Mujin* blooms at dawn and withers by dusk; the tree grows five or six *chi* tall, and its leaves resemble those of the pomegranate. It blooms this month and can be used to make hairpins. In Luo, it is called *chaosheng*. As the *Book of Songs* says, *"Fair as the blooming flower."* He forbids the people from kindling fires. *Fa* means to ignite.

One may dwell in high and bright places, gazing afar from hills and mounds, or reside in terraces and pavilions. A *tai* is earth piled high on all sides; a *tai* with a chamber is called a *xie*. This accords with the yang’s brightness. Another saying: observe the clouds and omens of the atmosphere.

If in mid-summer winter’s commands are enacted, hail and sleet will harm the grain, roads will become impassable, and violent armies will arrive. Winter’s freezing waters cause hail and sleet to damage the five grains. Winter’s qi is closed, and with abundant rain, roads sink and become impassable; thus, armies of destruction arrive unexpectedly. If spring’s commands are enacted, the five grains will not ripen, and locusts will arise in swarms, bringing famine to the land. Spring’s wood qi, favoring growth, delays the ripening of the five grains. *Bai teng* are insects of the locust family that arise in swarms to harm the grain, causing famine. If autumn’s commands are enacted, grasses and trees will wither prematurely, fruits will ripen too soon, and the people will suffer from epidemics. Fruits with pits are called *guo*; those without are called *luo*. Enacting autumn’s commands of ripening in mid-summer causes grasses and trees to wither and fruits to mature early. As this contravenes the season’s qi, the people fall ill with epidemics.

In the fifth month, the *Xiang* official is appointed, and elms are planted. This month, the yang qi flourishes and nurtures, hence the *Xiang* official is appointed. *Xiang* means assistant. The significance of the elm is not yet known.

In the final month of summer, the *Zhaoyao* star points south; at dusk, the Heart star culminates, and at dawn, the Straddler star culminates. The Heart is the eastern Azure Dragon’s constellation; this month, it culminates in the south at dusk. The Straddler is the western White Tiger’s constellation; this month, it culminates in the south at dawn. Its position is the center; its days are *wu* and *ji*. The supreme virtue resides in earth, and the Yellow Emperor’s spirit governs the center. *Wu* and *ji* are earth’s days. The supreme virtue resides in earth, for earth rules the center. Its creatures are the *luo*; its note is *gong*. Feathers fall and [become *luo*]; the *luo* insects and scaled creatures lead them. *Gong* is earth, the center, and the master of the five notes. The pitch corresponds to *Bai Zhong*; its number is five. *Bai Zhong* is *Lin Zhong*. This month, yang is at its peak and yin begins to rise, nurturing the myriad things—hence it is called *Bai Zhong*. Its number is five, for earth is the fifth of the Five Phases. Its flavor is sweet; its scent is fragrant. Earth’s flavor is sweet; earth’s scent is fragrant. Its sacrifice is the central channel, and it venerates the Heart. Earth is in charge, so the central channel is sacrificed. The central channel is the sacrifice within the chamber, venerating the Earth Lord. The Heart is fire, using what it overcomes. Another saying: the Heart is earth, employing its own storehouse.

Cool winds begin to arrive, and crickets dwell in the inner chambers. Crickets are *qinglie*, hastening to weave. As the *Book of Songs* says, *"In the seventh month, in the wilds; this day, in the inner chambers"*—this does not align with the classic. *Ao* may also be written as *bi*. Hawks begin to practice hunting, and rotten grass transforms into fireflies. As autumn’s season approaches, hawks train themselves to strike. *Yuan* are fireflies; in You and Ji, they are called *Qinqu*. *Yuan* is read as *jing* in *xi jing*.

The Son of Heaven wears pale yellow, rides a yellow-roan horse, adorns himself with yellow jade, and raises a yellow banner. Yellow accords with earth’s color. *Huang* refers to the color of ripe millet. He eats millet and beef, for both millet and cattle belong to earth. He drinks the water of the eight winds, cooks with jujube wood, and lights fires with mulberry. The central palace’s consorts wear yellow, dressed in yellow hues; their weapon is the sword. The final month of summer corresponds to the center. The sword has two edges, signifying that it generates nothing. Another saying: it signifies that nothing is mastered, yet all is mastered.

Its livestock is the ox, which presents itself at the central palace. In this month, the Son of Heaven holds court in the central palace. The central palace is the great chamber.

He commands the fishery officers to fell *jiao* and take *tuo*, to present tortoises and take *yuan*. The fishery officers oversee the fishing offices. *Yu* (fishing) is read as *yu* in *xiang yu* (mutual speech). *Jiao*, *tuo*, and *yuan* all belong to the fish kind. *Tuo* can be made into drums, as in the *Odes*: “The *tuo* drums resound.” *Yuan* can be made into broth, as the *Tradition* says: “The people of Chu presented a *yuan* to Duke Ling of Zheng. The Duke did not share the *yuan* broth with Prince Song, who in anger dipped his finger into the cauldron, tasted it, and departed.” None of these harm humans and are easily obtained, hence the word “take.” *Jiao* have scales and armor, can harm humans, and are difficult to obtain, hence the word “fell.” The tortoise is divine, can determine fortune and misfortune, and enters the ancestral temple; it is revered, hence the word “present.”

He commands the marsh officers to gather reeds and rushes. The marsh officers oversee the lakes and marshes. Gathering reeds and rushes supplies the state’s needs.

He commands the four inspectors to order the hundred counties to regularly provide fodder and straw to nourish the sacrificial animals. Under the Zhou system, the Son of Heaven’s domain extended a thousand *li*, divided into a hundred counties, each county having four commanderies, and each commandery four borderlands. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* say: “Minor grand masters receive counties; major grand masters receive commanderies.” When Qin was first established, it set up thirty-six commanderies to oversee the counties. Here, “hundred counties” refers to the counties within the royal domain under the Zhou system. The four inspectors oversee the four commandery grand masters. *Zhi* (regular) refers to what is due to be provided, hence it is gathered to nourish the sacrificial animals, to be offered to August Heaven and the Lord on High, the famous mountains and great rivers, the gods of the four directions, the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, to pray for blessings and bestow kindness on the people.

He commands that the dead be mourned and the sick inquired after, that the elderly be visited and cared for, that gruel be distributed, thick mats and bedding be provided, to send off the myriad things as they return. He commands the women’s offices to dye fabrics, embroidering patterns of *fu* and *fu*, with blue, yellow, white, and black—none failing in quality and excellence. Women are skilled at distinguishing the five colors, hence they dye fabrics. White and black form *fu*; blue and red form *fu*; black and red form *wen*; red and white form *zhang*. *Zhi* means fine; *liang* means good. These are used for the robes of the ancestral temples, which must be displayed in full and made bright. *Xuan* means complete; *ming* means radiant.

In this month, the trees are in full vigor; one must not dare to fell them. One may not assemble the feudal lords or initiate earthworks. To mobilize the masses or raise arms will surely bring heavenly calamity. *Yang* means punishment.

The earth is moist with summer heat, and great rains come in season. It is beneficial to kill weeds to fertilize the fields, enriching the soil and strengthening the boundaries. In this month of great heat, the earth is moist and the summer dampness heavy. There are also timely rains, which can be used to kill weeds for fertilizer, beautifying the soil and strengthening the fields. *Jiang* refers to the divisions of the land.

If in the final month of summer the commands of spring are enacted, the grain will split and fall, winds and coughs will abound, and the people will migrate. In spring, wood is in its ascendancy; the nature of wood is to shed and fall. When yang is released, winds are many. If its commands are enacted, the grain will split and fall, and the people will suffer from wind-borne illnesses, coughing and gasping for breath, resembling the scattering of spring yang. Thus, the people migrate.

If the commands of autumn are enacted, the hills and lowlands will flood, the crops will not ripen, and there will be many female calamities. *Qiu* means high; *xi* means low. This says that both high and low places will be flooded, thus killing the crops and preventing their ripening. When yin qi encounters disorder, there will be many female calamities. Female calamities refer to children not being raised.

If the commands of winter are enacted, the winds and cold will be untimely, hawks and falcons will strike early, and the people of the four borderlands will take refuge in walled settlements. In winter, yin is desolate and killing. If its commands are enacted, the cold winds will be unseasonable, hawks and falcons will strike early, and the people of the four frontiers will all enter the cities and towns to defend themselves.

The sixth month’s office is the *Shaonei*; its tree is the catalpa. In the sixth month, the crops ripen, hence the office of *Shaonei*. The catalpa’s significance is not yet known.

In the Seasonal Instructions for the Lesser Months:

In the first month of autumn, the stellar pointer *Zhaoyao* aligns with *Shen*. At dusk, the Dipper culminates; at dawn, the *Bi* asterism culminates. The Dipper is the northern constellation of the Dark Warrior, culminating at dusk in the southern sky this month. *Bi* is the western constellation of the White Tiger, culminating at dawn in the southern sky. Its position is the west; its days are *geng* and *xin*. The flourishing power resides in metal, and the deity Shaohao governs the west. *Geng* and *xin* correspond to metal. The flourishing power resides in metal, for metal rules the west. Its creatures are furred; its tone is *shang*. The qi of metal is cold, and armored creatures don fur. The tiger is the chief of furred creatures. *Shang* corresponds to metal, whose position is the west. The pitch standard is *Yize*. Its number is nine. *Yi* means "injury"; *ze* means "rule." This month, yang wanes and yin waxes, and the myriad things wither and suffer injury, conforming to the rule and completing their natures—hence *Yize*. Its number is nine, for in the five phases, metal is the fourth, and thus its number is nine. Its flavor is pungent; its odor is rank. Metal’s flavor is pungent; metal’s odor is rank. Its sacrifice is at the gate, and the liver is offered first. At the onset of early autumn, entry is made through the gate, hence the sacrifice at the gate. The liver corresponds to wood, and in sacrifice, the phase that metal conquers is used. Another saying: the liver sinks metal, employing its own organ. The cool wind arrives, white dew descends, the cold cicada sings, and the hawk begins to "sacrifice birds," commencing the execution of punishments. This month, hawks strike and kill birds in the great marshes, arranging them on all sides—this is called "sacrificing birds." From this time, the execution of punishments and penalties begins, aligning with the qi of autumn.

The Son of Heaven wears white robes, rides a white *luo* horse, adorns himself with white jade, raises a white banner, and white accords with the color of metal. A *luo* is a white horse with black mane. He eats hemp and dog, drinks the water of the eight winds, and cooks with fire from *zhe* wood. The consorts of the Western Palace wear white, dress in white hues, and strike the white bell. As metal rules the west, they reside in the Western Palace. Its weapon is the dagger-axe; its domestic animal is the dog. The court assembles at the *Zongzhang* hall’s left chamber to issue the autumnal commands. *Zongzhang* is the west-facing hall, where the myriad things are gathered and made manifest—hence *Zongzhang*. The left chamber is the southernmost room. From this chamber, the commands of the month are issued. The dog is the domestic animal of metal. Those who are unfilial, disobedient, violent, arrogant, or defiant are sought out and punished to assist the waning qi. The waning qi is yin qi.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the Son of Heaven personally leads the Three Dukes, the Nine Ministers, and the grand masters to welcome autumn at the western suburbs. The western suburbs lie beyond the nine-*li* outer boundary. Upon returning, he rewards military leaders and warriors in the court. The *junshuai* are the generals.

The martial in towns brings fame to the brave. The command is given to generals and officers to select soldiers, sharpen weapons, and train the most outstanding and capable, entrusting them to those with merit, to punish the unrighteous, seek out and execute the violent and insolent, and bring order to the four directions. *Shun* means to follow; the four directions are the world.

Officials are ordered to refine laws and systems, repair prisons, prohibit wickedness and block evil, carefully adjudicate cases, and settle disputes. *Jue* means to decide; *ping* means to govern.

Heaven and Earth begin their solemnity—excess must not be allowed. *Su* means killing; the killing *qi* begins to act. *Ying* means abundance, hence it is said that excess must not be allowed.

In this month, farmers begin to harvest grain, and the Son of Heaven tastes the new crop, first offering it to the ancestral temple. *Sheng* means completion; *jian* means to present.

The command is given to all officials to begin gathering and storing, for early autumn is the start of inward containment. Repair dikes and embankments, carefully fortify barriers and passes to prepare for floods; mend city walls and renovate palaces. In this month, the moon aligns with the *Bi* constellation, bringing heavy rains—hence the preparation for floods.

Do not enfeoff marquises, establish high offices, distribute valuable gifts, or dispatch grand envoys. In following this month’s commands, cool winds arrive within thirty days. *Feng hou* means granting land and enfeoffing towns. *Da guan* refers to the nine-rank nobility. *Zhong bi* are gifts of metal and silk. *Da shi* are envoys dispatched by high ministers. The *qi* of metal is contracting—none of these actions are suitable now, hence the prohibition.

If in early autumn the commands of winter are followed, *yin qi* will prevail excessively, armored insects will harm the grain, and hostile armies will arrive. Early autumn is *yin*, and if the dominant *qi* of winter water is enacted again, *yin qi* will dominate, and armored insects will damage the grain. As *yin qi* converges, hostile armies come.

If the commands of spring are followed, the land will suffer drought, *yang qi* will return, and the five grains will bear no fruit. Spring’s *yang* is scorching and dry, and enacting its commands will cause drought. *Yang qi* returning means that in this month, cool winds should prevail, yet warm winds are enacted instead—thus the grain is ruined and bears no fruit.

If the commands of summer are followed, winter will see many fires, cold and heat will be unregulated, and the people will suffer from malaria. Summer is ruled by fire, and enacting its commands will cause many fires. As cold and heat clash, they become unbalanced, leading to malaria. Malaria arises from cold and heat.

In the seventh month, the office is the armory, and its tree is the *lian*. The armory is the storehouse of weapons; as autumn’s season requires the ordering of arms, it is called the armory. Its tree is the *lian*, whose fruit is eaten by the phoenix—such trees still grow near Luoyang. The *lian* fruit ripens in autumn, hence its association. *Lian* is pronounced like the *lian* in dyeing and bleaching.

In the mid-autumn month, the *Zhaoyao* star points to *you*, the *Qianniu* constellation culminates at dusk, and the *ZiGui* culminates at dawn. *Qianniu* is the northern Dark Warrior constellation, which in this month culminates at dusk in the south. *ZiGui* is the western White Tiger constellation, which in this month culminates at dawn in the south.

Its position is the west, its days are *geng* and *xin*, its creatures are furred, its tone is *shang*, its pitch pipe is *Nanlü*, its number is nine, and the south is *ren*. This means the *yang qi* of *Nanlü* assists *yin*, and *yin* takes up the task of completing the myriad things. *Geng* and *xin* are the days of metal.

Its flavor is pungent, its scent is rank, its sacrifice is at the gate, and the liver is offered first. Cool winds arrive, the wild geese come, the swallows return, and flocks of birds soar. The seasonal geese come from the northern deserts, passing through Zhou and Luoyang to reach Pengli. The swallows return to their hibernation sites after the autumn equinox. The flocks of birds soar as the cold arrives, growing plump and testing their wings in high flight. *Xiang* means the six pinions do not move; some interpret it as *yang*, nurturing their feathers.

The Son of Heaven wears white robes, rides a white camel, adorns himself with white jade, raises a white banner, eats hemp and dog, drinks the water of the eight winds, and cooks with *zhe* fire. In the western palace, the consorts wear white, dress in white hues, and strike the white bells. Its weapons are spears and shields, its domestic animal is the dog, and court is held in the *Zongzhang* ancestral temple. *Zongzhang* is the west-facing hall; the ancestral temple is the central chamber.

Officials are ordered to strictly enforce all punishments, ensuring that executions are just and without distortion or leniency. *Wang* means crooked; *nao* means weak—this means to act with fairness and uprightness. If judgments are unjust, the misfortune will return to the judge. *Fan* means to return.

In this month, the elderly are cared for, provided with armrests and canes, and offered food and drink. The stewards and invocators are commanded to prepare sacrificial animals, inspecting the fodder-fed and grain-fed—those fed on grass are *chu*, and those fed on grain are *huan*. They review the records and examine the tributes. *Huan* is pronounced like the *huan* in "serving and learning." They inspect the animals’ fatness or leanness, wholeness, and purity—*quan* means without defect, and *cui* means the fur’s color is pure. *Cui* is pronounced like the *sui* in "misfortune."

They examine the creatures’ colors, compare their types, measure their sizes, and observe their ages, ensuring all meet the standards. The Son of Heaven then performs the *nuo* ritual to ward off autumn’s *qi*. *Nuo* means to expel; *yu* means to stop—stopping autumn’s *qi* to prevent harm. *Nuo* is pronounced like the *nan* in "restless difficulty." Some texts write *qi* as *bing* (weapons).

Hemp and dog are tasted and first offered to the ancestral temple. In this month, city walls and moats may be constructed, and capitals and towns established. A state with the ancestral temple of a former ruler is called a *du*; without, it is called a *yi*. *Du* are walled, and *yi* are built. Dig drainage channels and cellars, and repair granaries. *Chuan dou* are for water flow to prevent damp ground; *chuan jiao* are for storing grain. *Jiao* is pronounced like the *jiao* in "storing goods."

Officials are ordered to urge the people to gather and store, amass supplies, and encourage the planting of winter wheat. If the season is missed, punishment is certain without doubt.

In this month, thunder begins to withdraw, hibernating insects seal their burrows, killing *qi* grows increasingly strong, *yang qi* daily wanes, and waters begin to dry. *He* means to congeal and deplete; some texts write *he* as *sheng*, meaning *yin* prevails.

Day and night are equal. Standardize measurements, balance weights, correct steelyards and stone weights, adjust measuring vessels, regulate markets and customs, and welcome merchants and travelers. *Li* means to open and connect.

Gather goods and wealth to facilitate the people’s affairs. From all directions they come together, even from distant lands they arrive; resources are not lacking, the ruler has no shortage of supplies, and all matters thus come to fruition. *Fruition* means completion.

If in the mid-autumn month the spring command is enacted, autumn rains will not fall, grasses and trees will flourish, and the state will face great terror. Spring is the season of *yang qi*, and enacting its command prevents rain from descending. Moreover, the warmth and nurturing benevolence cause grasses and trees to bloom. When *qi* clash, disaster and misfortune must follow, hence the state is seized by great alarm.

If the summer command is enacted, the land will suffer drought, hibernating insects will not retreat into hiding, and the five grains will all sprout anew. Enacting the command of scorching *yang* brings drought. The heat causes hibernating insects to remain active and the five grains to regrow.

If the winter command is enacted, wind disasters will frequently arise, thunder will cease prematurely, and grasses and trees will die early. Enacting the command of cold *qi* provokes wind disasters. Moreover, winter is the season of closure and storage, so thunder withdraws early and grasses and trees perish prematurely.

In the eighth month, the office of the *Wei* is established, and the *zhe* tree is planted. *Wei* is the military official. This month is for training troops, hence the appointment of the *Wei*. As the saying goes, "The Yangshe Grand Master served as *Zhongjun Wei* of Zhe"—though the meaning of *zhe* remains unclear.

In the late autumn month, the *Zhaoyao* constellation points to *Xu*, the *Xu* constellation culminates at dusk, and the *Liu* constellation culminates at dawn. *Xu* is the northern constellation of the Dark Warrior; this month, it culminates in the southern sky at dusk. *Liu* is the southern constellation of the Vermilion Bird; this month, it culminates in the southern sky at dawn. Its position is the west, its days are *geng* and *xin*, its creatures are furred, its note is *shang*, and its pitch pipe is *Wuyi*. *Yin qi* ascends while *yang qi* descends, and all things follow *yang* into hiding—*Wuyi* emerges at this time. Its number is nine, its flavor is pungent, its odor is rank, its sacrifice is at the gate, and the liver is offered first in worship. The wild geese arrive as guests, and the guest sparrows enter the great waters to become clams.

This month, the geese come from the northern deserts, migrating south to Pengli. Those arriving in the eighth month are likely the parents, while those coming now are their offspring. Their wings are still tender and weak, so they follow behind. The *guest sparrows* are the elder sparrows that roost in the halls of human dwellings like guests, hence the name. The *great waters* refer to the sea. As the saying goes, "Sparrows enter the sea and become clams."

Chrysanthemums bloom with yellow flowers, and jackals offer beasts and slay birds. Jackals resemble dogs but have long tails and yellow fur. This month, they kill beasts and arrange them on all sides, a practice the world calls "offering beasts." *Slay* means to kill.

The Son of Heaven wears white robes, rides a white camel, adorns himself with white jade, raises a white banner, eats hemp and dog, drinks the water of the eight winds, and cooks with *zhe* fire. In the Western Palace, the consorts wear white, dress in white hues, and strike the white bell. Their weapon is the dagger-axe, their animal is the dog, and they hold court in the *Zongzhang* hall facing right. The right side of the hall faces west, and the northernmost chamber is called the right quarter.

Officials are ordered to enforce strict commands: all officials, high and low, must devote themselves to assisting in the storage of Heaven and Earth, allowing nothing to be released. The *Zhongzai* is then commanded to ensure the harvest is fully gathered, to compile the essential records of the five grains. *Zhong* means great, *zai* means to govern, and *qing* refers to the officials. *Essential* refers to the registers.

Store the harvest of the imperial fields in the divine granary. The Son of Heaven’s personal fields span a thousand *mu*, hence the term "imperial harvest." The grain from these fields is stored in the divine granary.

This month, frost begins to fall, and all artisans rest. With frost descending and the weather growing cold, red lacquer becomes difficult to apply, so all artisans cease work and no longer craft vessels.

Officials are then commanded: "The cold *qi* is fully arrived, and the people’s strength cannot endure it—let them all enter their homes." As the *Book of Songs* says, "Enter these chambers to dwell."

On the first *ding* day, students enter the academy to practice wind instruments. A grand sacrifice is offered to the Supreme Sovereign, and animal victims are tasted. The feudal lords are assembled, and the hundred counties are regulated. On the first *ding* day of the month’s first decade, students enter the academy to practice reed pipes and zithers, study ritual and music, sacrifice to the Supreme Sovereign with animal victims, and assemble the feudal lords to standardize the distinctions in carriages and robes, each according to their rank. The *hundred counties* refer to those within the royal domain; "hundred" is used to denote the whole.

Prepare for the coming year’s first day of the month, and determine the system of taxation for the feudal lords—its weight and measure, the annual tribute, and the standards based on the distance and suitability of the land. *Coming year* refers to the next year. *First day of the month* is like the modern practice of officials presenting the almanac for the coming year. *Standards* refer to the regularity of tribute and taxation.

Then instruct in the field hunt to practice the five weapons. *Weapons* refer to the blade, sword, spear, halberd, and arrow—hence the five weapons.

Command the Grand Coachman and the seven grooms to harness the *dairen* carriages, distribute them by rank, and arrange them properly outside the screen. *Rank* means grade; carriages are assigned according to the high or low status of their occupants. *Properly* means to stand them in place. *Arrange* means to set them in order. The Son of Heaven’s outer screen is a planted hedge. As the *Erya* says, "The hedge within the gate is called a planted hedge."

The Minister of Education, holding the staff, faces north to assist. *Holding* means to tuck it in. The staff is for instruction. Tucking it into the belt, he assists in the solemn ceremony. The Minister of Education oversees the masses and instructs them.

The Son of Heaven then dons fierce attire with grand adornments, takes up bow and arrow, and hunts. This month, the Son of Heaven values martial prowess, so he wears fierce and imposing garments with elaborate ornaments to capture game.

Command the master of sacrifices to offer beasts to the four directions. *Command* means to instruct. The *master of sacrifices* is the official in charge of rituals. Offering beasts to the four directions means sacrificing to the spirits who first set forth birds and beasts in the four directions, repaying their merit. Since their divine presence is unknown, offerings are broadly made to the four directions.

This month, grasses and trees yellow and shed their leaves. Thus, one fells timber to make charcoal. Hibernating creatures all crouch low, so one hastens to prisons and punishments, leaving no guilty party detained. *Crouch* means to lie concealed. In Qingzhou, *crouch* is pronounced as *俛*. *Leaving none detained* means judgments must be swift. One also reclaims salaries and emoluments from those unworthy of them, as well as support from those undeserving of sustenance. *Unworthy* refers to those without virtue who receive emoluments. *Undeserving* refers to the unfilial. Another interpretation: those supported have rendered no merit to the state, and their ancestors possessed no worthy virtue, so their support is deemed improper and thus revoked.

Roads are cleared and paths repaired, beginning at the borders and concluding within the capital. This month, the Son of Heaven samples hemp with dog meat, first offering it to the ancestral temple. This is the height of filial piety.

If in late autumn one implements summer ordinances, the state will suffer great floods, winter stores will be ruined, and the people will frequently suffer from nasal congestion and obstruction. Late autumn is a time of yin qi, yet if one enforces the summer’s ceaseless rains, floods will ensue. Fire qi (heat) disrupts winter storage, causing ruin. Fire and metal clash, so the people suffer nasal congestion—*鼽* is pronounced like *仇* (enmity). If one implements winter ordinances, the state will see many thieves and bandits, borders will be unsettled, and lands will be divided. Winter’s water is pure yin, breeding treacherous schemes, hence the proliferation of thieves and bandits, unsettling borderlands. Lands will be encroached upon and partitioned by neighboring states. If one implements spring ordinances, warm winds will arrive, the people’s qi will slacken, and armies will be mobilized. Spring’s yang qi is warm, so warm winds come, and the people’s qi grows lax. Wood invades metal, so armies are raised—2,500 men form a *division*, and 500 a *brigade*.

In the ninth month, the office of observation is established, and the tree is the locust. *Observation* means to watch. This month, defenses are repaired, hence the office of observation. The locust tree (*槐*) is associated with *embracing* (*怀*), for it can draw distant people near.

In the first month of winter, the *Diurnal Revolving Star* points to *Hai*, the *Rooftop* constellation culminates at dusk, and the *Seven Stars* culminate at dawn. *Rooftop* is a constellation of the northern Dark Warrior; this month, it culminates in the south at dusk. The *Seven Stars* are a constellation of the southern Vermilion Bird; this month, they culminate in the south at dawn. Its position is the north, its days are *Ren* and *Gui*, its supreme power resides in water, and the spirit Zhuanxu governs the north. *Ren* and *Gui* are water days. *Supreme power resides in water* means water rules the north. Its creatures are armored, its tone is *yu*, and *armored* refers to shells, symbolizing winter’s closure and solidity. The turtle is the chief of armored creatures. *Yu* pertains to water. The pitch pipe *Yingzhong* is in harmony, its number is six. Yin responds to yang, completing its work; all things gather and mature, hence *Yingzhong* (Responsive Bell). Its number is six because the five phases number five, and water is first, thus six. Its flavor is salty, its odor is putrid—water’s flavor is salty, and its odor is putrid. Its sacrifice is to the kidneys. Well water sustains people, hence its veneration. *Well* may also be written as *path*. The earth within gates is also venerated. Winter’s guard is within, hence its veneration. The kidneys pertain to water, opening their storehouse.

This month, ice begins to form, the earth starts to freeze, pheasants enter great waters and become clams, and rainbows hide from sight. *Clams* are bivalves. *Great waters* refer to the Huai River. Tradition states: "Pheasants entering the Huai become clams." Rainbows are yang within yin. This month, yin prevails, so they are not seen.

The Son of Heaven wears black robes, rides a dark steed, adorns himself with black jade, raises a black banner, and aligns with the power of water. Banners depict bears and tigers. He eats glutinous millet and pig, imbibes the eight winds’ water, cooks with pine and fir, and resides in the northern palace. The palace’s attendants wear black, dress in black hues, and strike sounding stones. Water rules the north, hence the northern palace. His weapons are forged, his livestock are pigs—forging retracts inward, symbolizing yin’s closure. Pigs are water’s creatures.

He holds court in the left chamber of the Black Hall to issue winter’s ordinances. The hall faces north, and the western chamber is called the *left chamber*. Residing here, he enacts this month’s decrees. He commands officials to enforce all prohibitions, aligning with yin’s closure. All that should be forbidden is entrusted to officials for enforcement. Migration is prohibited, gates and lanes are sealed, and guests are thoroughly searched. Tradition states: "Old guests are forbidden to reveal secrets; new guests are searched to observe their intentions." *Gates* are city gates; *lanes* are neighborhood gates. These are strictly sealed for defense. Punishments are meted out, and the guilty are executed—all due punishments are decided. Those deserving punishment are rightly condemned, hence executed. Those who flatter superiors and disrupt the law are punished. *Flattery* means currying favor with superiors to disrupt law and order. *Punished* means corrected.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the Son of Heaven personally leads the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, and high officials to welcome the year at the northern suburbs. Upon returning, he rewards those who died in service and provides for orphans and widows. Those who died in loyal service to the state are honored by rewarding their descendants. *Orphans* are fatherless children; *widows* are husbandless women—both are comforted and relieved. This month, he commands the Grand Invocator to pray and sacrifice to the spirits, divine with tortoise and milfoil, and scrutinize hexagrams and omens to discern fortune and misfortune.

Now the Son of Heaven dons furs. He commands all officials to securely store provisions, orders the Minister of Education to gather supplies, repair city walls, fortify gates and lanes, mend weapons and locks, secure keys and seals—*seals* are doors, and *seals* are stamps. Borders are reinforced, strategic passes are fortified, footpaths are blocked, and mourning rites are prepared. Coffins, outer coffins, grave clothes, and shrouds are examined for their proper thickness. *Prepared* means arranged; *rites* refer to the twenty-five-month mourning period. Coffins, outer coffins, grave clothes, and shrouds vary in thickness by rank, hence their scrutiny. Graves and mounds are measured for size and height, ensuring nobles and commoners, high and low, each have their proper degree. *Measured* means assessed; *graves and mounds* are tombs, with size and height varying by rank.

This month, artisans present their works, ritual vessels are displayed, standards are reviewed, and firmness and precision are prized.

Reviewing the standards is *inspection*; *standards* are models. *Firm and precise* means sturdy craftsmanship. *For* signifies *therefore*; *supreme* means *abundant*. If artisans’ work is shoddy or careless, or their creations excessively ornate, they shall surely be punished. *Shoddy* means poor; *careless* means unsteady. *Excessively ornate* refers to craft beyond the proper measure. Therefore, they shall be punished. *Shoddy* here denotes salt that has caked.

This month, the great steaming sacrifice is held. The Son of Heaven prays to the Celestial Honored Ones for the coming year. *Steaming* is the winter sacrifice. At this time, great feasts of wine are held while offering sacrifices to seek blessings for the next year. All celestial deities belonging to the Son of Heaven—sun, moon, and stars—are called the Celestial Honored Ones. Grand supplications are made at the public altar to the earth, and upon completion, ancestors are feasted. *Supplication* means to entreat. The *public altar* is the sacrifice to the Queen of Earth. In life, she is the highest duke; in death, a revered spirit—hence called *duke*. *Completion* refers to feasting ancestors, observing the principle of honoring the public before the private.

The toiling farmers are granted rest. Commanders and generals drill troops in martial arts, practicing archery and charioteering, and testing strength in wrestling. *Drill* means to practice; *wrestling* takes place on level ground. *Strength* describes vigor. Then the Water Stewards and Fishery Masters are ordered to collect taxes from springs, pools, and marshes. *Stewards* are officials in charge of water; *masters* are leaders. *Taxes* are levies. Let none encroach or overreach. *Overreach* means excess.

If in early winter the seasonal decree of spring is enacted, then the frost’s closure will not be tight, the earth’s qi will leak forth, and the people will scatter in great numbers. For spring’s yang qi disperses and overflows—hence the frost’s closure is not tight and the earth’s qi leaks forth. The people scatter in great numbers, resembling the spreading of yang qi.

If the seasonal decree of summer is enacted, then violent winds will arise frequently, midwinter will lack cold, and hibernating creatures will emerge again. Winter should be a time of closure and storage; instead, the decree of summer’s flourishing is enacted—hence violent winds arise frequently. The warmth of yang qi ensures that even in the depths of winter there is no cold, causing hibernating creatures to emerge again.

If the seasonal decree of autumn is enacted, then snow and frost will fall untimely, minor conflicts will frequently arise, and the land will be encroached upon and diminished. Autumn’s qi is dry, and winter’s great cold should not bring snow or frost—yet they fall, hence they are untimely. Minor conflicts arise repeatedly, neighboring states invade and seize the land.

In the tenth month, the office of the Minister of War is in charge, and its tree is the sandalwood. Winter is the season for martial training, hence the office of the Minister of War. Sandalwood is a yin wood.

In the month of mid-winter, the Dipper’s handle points to the *zi* position, the *Bi* constellation culminates at dusk, and the *Zhen* constellation culminates at dawn. The Eastern Wall is the northern quadrant’s Dark Warrior constellation; this month it culminates in the south at dusk. *Zhen* is the southern quadrant’s Vermilion Bird constellation; this month it culminates in the south at dawn. Its position is the north, its days are *ren* and *gui*, its creatures are armored, its tone is *yu*, its pitch pipe is the Yellow Bell, and its number is six. The Yellow Bell signifies yang qi gathering below and yin qi flourishing above, with all things yellow and sprouting within the earth—hence it is called the Yellow Bell. Its flavor is salty, its odor is putrid, its sacrifice is to the well, and the kidneys are offered first.

Water grows stronger, the earth begins to crack, the *guān* and *jū* birds fall silent, and tigers begin to mate. The *guān* and *jū* are mountain birds. In this month, yin prevails, hence they fall silent. The tiger is yin within yang; with yin qi flourishing, it responds in kind. *Mate* is read as the *xiao* in *jiangxiao* (general).

The Son of Heaven wears black robes, rides a black-maned iron-black horse, adorns himself with dark jade, raises a black banner, eats millet and swine, drinks the water of the eight winds, and cooks with pine and fire-drill flames. In the northern palace, the consorts wear black, dress in black hues, and strike the sounding stone. Their weapon is the forged blade, their beast is the swine, and they hold court in the Dark Hall of the Grand Ancestral Temple. The hall faces north, the chamber lies at the center—hence it is called the Grand Ancestral Temple.

He commands the officials, saying: “Let no earthworks be undertaken, no dwellings opened, nor great assemblies gathered. This is called ‘opening the treasures of heaven and earth.’ All hibernating creatures will die, the people will surely suffer epidemics, and some will follow in death.”

Swiftly capture thieves and bandits, and execute those who are licentious, deceitful, or fraudulent. This month is called the *Chang* month. With yin qi above, the people are empty and idle—hence it is called the *Chang* month.

He commands the Intendant of the Palace Eunuchs to reiterate the palace decrees. *Yan* is the office; *yin* is the director. Reiterating the palace decrees means to issue stern warnings. Inspect the gates and lanes, secure the chambers, and ensure all are tightly sealed to assist the yin qi. Reduce the tasks of women.

Then he commands the Grand Brewer: the glutinous and non-glutinous rice must be uniform, the yeast and malt must be timely. The *qiú* is the official in charge of brewing. Fermenting the grains and yeast to maturity—hence he is called *qiú*. *Qiú* is read as the *qiú* in *qiúháo* (chieftain); *uniform* is read as the *qí* in *qíhé* (harmony). The yeast and malt must be made at the proper time; if untimely, they will not succeed. The steeping and steaming must be pure, the water and springs must be fragrant. *Zhàn* means to soak; the steaming must be immaculate. If the water and springs are fragrant, the wine will be excellent. *Zhàn* is read as the *shěn* in *shěnfǔ* (to examine a cauldron); *xī* is read as the *chì* in *chìhuǒ* (blazing fire).

The pottery must be fine, the firing temperature must be precise, with no deviations. The pottery refers to earthenware. The cooking and offering must be appropriate—hence it is said there should be no deviations.

The Son of Heaven then commands the officials to sacrifice to the four seas, great rivers, famous lakes, and marshes. They can summon clouds and rain—hence they are sacrificed to.

In this month, if farmers have not gathered and stored their harvests, or if cattle, horses, livestock, or wild animals have been lost or released, they may be taken without reproach. *Reproach* means to question or interrogate.

In the mountains, forests, marshes, and wetlands, those who gather wild foods or hunt birds and beasts are instructed and guided by the Wild Stewards. If there is any encroachment or seizure, the offenders are punished without pardon. Severe penalties are imposed.

In this month, the days reach their shortest, yin and yang contend, and the noble person fasts and abstains. They dwell in seclusion, their bodies seek stillness, and they shun music and beauty. *Music* refers to the sounds of strings, bamboo, metal, and stone; *beauty* refers to alluring appearances. Those who indulge in greed and excess are prohibited. They calm their bodies and settle their forms and natures, closing off emotions and desires.

In this month, *li* stalks emerge, *yun* begins to grow, earthworms coil, and elk shed their antlers. *Li* is the *mali* herb; *yun* is *yunhao*, a type of vegetable; *qiuyin* is a kind of insect, and *coiling* means to curl and knot. The shedding of elk antlers—all respond to the subtle rise of yang qi.

When springs and streams stir, trees may be felled, bamboo arrows gathered, and idle officials and useless implements dismissed. *Dismiss* means to reduce. Gates and courtyards are slowly closed, and prisons are built to assist Heaven and Earth in their closure.

If in the mid-winter month summer ordinances are enacted, the land will suffer drought, mist and fog will shroud the skies, and thunder will sound. Summer’s qi is scorching yang, hence the land dries; clear and turbid clash, hence mist and fog gather. Thunder in the eleventh month is untimely, thus it is said *then*.

If autumn ordinances are enacted, there will be excessive rain, gourds and melons will fail to ripen, and the land will face great warfare. Autumn’s metal qi is the mother of water, hence the rain; with water and metal in dominance, great warfare arises.

If spring ordinances are enacted, insects will ravage the crops, springs will dry up, and the people will suffer plagues. Spring’s yang qi stirs hibernating creatures, hence insects ruin the grain and springs run dry. Yang invades yin, qi is disharmonious, hence plagues spread.

In the eleventh month, the office of the Capital Defender is established, and jujube trees are planted. Winter is the season for military readiness, hence the Capital Defender is appointed. Jujubes are chosen for their red hearts.

In the final month of winter, the *Diurnal Star* points to *Chou*, the constellation *Lou* culminates at dusk, and *Di* culminates at dawn. *Lou* is the western White Tiger constellation, which at dusk this month aligns due south. *Di* is the eastern Azure Dragon constellation, which at dawn this month aligns due south. Its position is the north, its days are *ren* and *gui*, its creatures are armored, its tone is *yu*, and its pitch standard is *Dalü*. *Lü* means *to travel*—all things stir in the yellow springs yet cannot emerge, so they *travel* to leave yin and approach yang, aiding their completion, hence it is called *Great Lü*. Its number is six, its flavor is salty, its odor is putrid, its sacrifice is to the well, and the kidneys are offered first. Geese turn northward, and magpies begin to build nests. Geese on Pengli Lake all face north, preparing to reach the northern deserts. Magpies, sensing yang, rise to build nests. Pheasants call, and hens cluck for eggs. As the *Book of Songs* says, “At dawn the pheasant calls, still seeking his mate”—this is the meaning; hens cluck to gather their eggs.

The Son of Heaven wears black robes, rides a black steed, adorns himself with dark jade, raises a black banner, eats wheat and pork, drinks the water of the eight winds, and burns pine and fir for fire. The women of the Northern Palace wear black, dress in dark hues, and strike stone chimes. Their weapons are forged, their livestock are swine, and they hold court in the eastern chamber of the Dark Hall. *Eastern chamber* refers to the room on the east side.

He commands the officials to perform the Great Exorcism and the *Pangzhe* ritual, and to fashion the Earth Ox. The *Great Exorcism* is today’s rite of driving out yin and expelling pestilence to guide yang. *Pangzhe* means slaughtering dogs and sheep on all four sides to ward off illness and plague. The *Earth Ox* is the clay oxen now displayed in villages and counties to encourage farming.

He commands the Fishery Steward to begin fishing. This month, as fishing commences, he appoints its overseer. *Fishery* is read as in the *Analects*. The Son of Heaven personally goes to shoot fish, first offering them to the ancestral temple.

He orders the people to prepare the five grains, directs farmers to plan paired plowing, repair plows and plowshares, and ready farming tools. *Paired* means joined. He commands the Music Masters to gather for a grand wind performance and then dismiss them. He then orders the Four Inspectors to collect firewood for the ancestral temple and the hundred sacrifices.

In this month, the sun completes its cycle, the moon its course, and the stars their circuit. The twelve cycles end at the *Oxherd* constellation. The *course* concludes at its former lodging. The stars’ circuit of the heavens—referring to the twenty-eight lodgings appearing in the south—is completed this month.

As the year prepares to renew, he orders the farmers to rest and not be employed. The Son of Heaven then, with the dukes, ministers, and great officers, adorns the state’s laws, deliberates the seasonal ordinances, and awaits the suitability of the coming year.

He commands the Grand Scribe to arrange the feudal lords in order and levy their tribute of sacrificial animals. *Levy* means to distribute. These are to supply the offerings of hay and grain to August Heaven, the Supreme Lord, the altars of soil and grain.

He commands the states of the same surname to provide livestock for the ancestral temple, while ministers, great officers, and commoners supply the sacrifices for famous mountains, forests, and great rivers.

If in the final month of winter autumn ordinances are enacted, white dew will descend early, armored creatures will become omens, and the borderlands will retreat to fortified towns. Autumn’s season brings white dew, hence its early descent. Armored creatures become portents of disaster. Metal qi brings warfare, hence the people of the four borders enter walled cities for self-defense.

If spring ordinances are enacted, fetuses will be harmed, the land will suffer chronic illnesses, and this will be called *perverse*. The final month of winter is bitter cold, yet spring’s warmth is enacted—qi is disharmonious, hence fetuses are harmed and the land suffers grave illness. This violates the proper flow of qi, thus it is called *perverse*.

If summer ordinances are enacted, floods will ruin the land, timely snow will not fall, and ice will melt prematurely. Summer’s qi is scorching yang, bringing excessive rains, hence floods ruin the land. Timely snow should fall but does not; ice should not melt but does—both are signs of disorder.

In the twelfth month, the office of the Prison Warden is established, and oak trees are planted. The twelfth month marks the year’s end and the conclusion of punishments, hence the Prison Warden. Oaks can be used for chariot hubs; no other wood produces fire as readily as oak, which also responds to the qi of elimination.

The Five Directions: The eastern extreme begins at Mount Jieshi, passes through Chaoxian, crosses the land of the *Daren*, and ends at Jieshi on the western bank of the Ruo River in Liaoxi.

ChaoXian is the county of LeLang. *Guan* means "to pass through." The land of the *Daren* lies to its east. To the east, it extends to the place where the sun rises, the land of the *Fumu* tree, the wilds of blue earth and towering woods—*Fumu* is the *fusang* tree. This is the domain governed by TaiHao and GouMang, spanning twelve thousand *li*. TaiHao is FuXi, the Daoist emperor of the east, whose virtue is Wood. GouMang is the spirit of Wood; *si* means "to preside over." His decree states: Uphold all prohibitions, open and close the gates, unblock the obstructed, clear the blocked, act with ease, cast aside resentment and malice, absolve those bound by labor and punishment, and dispel cares and calamities. Punishments are to be mitigated; open the passes and bridges, distribute wealth, reconcile external grievances, pacify the four directions, enact gentle kindness, and restrain harsh strength. Those who are harsh and overbearing, who encroach upon others and do not follow the proper measures, are to be prohibited.

To the south, the extreme begins beyond Beihu Sun. Beihu Sun is the name of a state; the sun lies to its north, so all doors face north on account of the sun. It passes through the land of ZhuanXu and extends south to the wilds of scorching fire and blazing winds. This is the domain governed by the Red Emperor and ZhuRong, spanning twelve thousand *li*. The Red Emperor is YanDi, son of ShaoDian, known as ShenNong, the Daoist emperor of the south, whose virtue is Fire. ZhuRong is the grandson of ZhuanXu, son of LaoTong, named WuHui. He is also called Li and served as the Fire Minister of GaoXin; he was given the title ZhuRong and, upon death, became the spirit of Fire. His decree states: Confer ranks upon the virtuous, reward the meritorious, bestow kindness upon the worthy and good, relieve hunger and thirst, promote agriculture, aid the impoverished, care for the orphaned and widowed, attend to the weary and sick, dispense great emoluments, enact great rewards, restore ruined ancestral temples, establish heirs for the heirless, enfeoff lords, and appoint worthy ministers. These are responses to the yang qi and its manifestations.

At the central axis, from Kunlun eastward past the Two Heng Mountains—*zi* means "from," *jue* means "to pass." Heng Mountain is Chang Mountain; the "two" is unexplained—lies the path of the sun and moon, the sources of the Jiang and Han rivers. The sun and moon illuminate their traversed paths. The Jiang emerges from Min Mountain, the Han from Fan Zhong Mountain. This is the land of the multitudes, where the five grains thrive, where Longmen, the Yellow River, and the Ji River converge, where the息壤 soil dams the floodwaters of the provinces, extending east to Jieshi. This domain of twelve thousand *li* is governed by the Yellow Emperor and Hou Tu.

The Yellow Emperor, son of ShaoDian, rectified the realm with the virtue of Earth and was titled the Xuanyuan Clan. Upon death, he became the imperial spirit of Earth’s central virtue. Hou Tu was the son of the Gou Long Clan, named Hou Tu, who leveled the nine lands; upon death, he was venerated as the Earth Spirit.

His decree states: Be impartial yet not obsequious, discerning yet not harsh. Envelop and shelter all, moistening (*lu* means "to moisten") without exception. Embrace all with boundless impartiality, rectify and still the self to harmonize. Distribute grain, nourish the aged and infirm, mourn the dead and inquire after the sick, to guide the return of the ten thousand things. Earth is the master of the four directions, hence it is said that the ten thousand things return to it.

At the western extremity, from Kunlun past the Flowing Sands and the Sinking Feathers, west to the land of Sanwei—Flowing Sands likely lie southwest of Kunlun—stand stone cities and golden halls, the realm of the Qi-Drinking People, the land of the Undying. This domain of twelve thousand *li* is governed by Shaohao and Rushou.

Shaohao, son of the Yellow Emperor, was named Qingyang (also called Zhi). He ruled the realm with the virtue of Metal and was titled the Jin Tian Clan. Upon death, he became the imperial spirit of Metal’s western virtue. Rushou was a descendant of the Jin Tian Clan, named Xiu Li; upon death, he became the Metal Spirit.

His decree states: Apply laws with precision, execute only the guilty, guard against thieves and bandits, forbid wickedness and deceit. Adorn the herds and flocks, tend the granaries, repair city walls, mend breaches, block paths, obstruct ditches, halt flowing waters, dam valleys, guard gates and lanes, array weapons and armor, select officials, and punish the lawless. This is the response to Metal’s decisive power.

At the northern extremity, from the Nine Marshes to the farthest reaches of Great Darkness, north to the Valley of Lingzheng—Nine Marshes are the northern marshes; *xia* means "great," *hui* means "darkness"—lies a land of frozen cold, piled ice, snow, hail, frost, and sleet, where waters surge and moisten. This domain of twelve thousand *li* is governed by Zhuanxu and Xuanming.

Zhuanxu, grandson of the Yellow Emperor, ruled the realm with the virtue of Water and was titled the Gaoyang Clan. Upon death, he became the imperial spirit of Water’s northern virtue. The spirit Xuanming was a son of the Jin Tian Clan named Mei, who served as the Master of Dark Obscurity; upon death, he was venerated as the Water Spirit.

His decree states: Enforce prohibitions, secure and store, repair barriers and blockades, mend passes and bridges. Forbid relocation, impose punishments, execute the guilty, close gates and lanes, conduct great searches for outsiders, halt social gatherings, ban nighttime revelry. Close early and open late to block evildoers. Cultivate virtue, hold fast to it. When the celestial mandate nears its end, execute punishments without pardon. Even the most exalted kin must be judged by law. Do not channel water, do not open stores, do not release the guilty. This is the response to Yin’s destructive power.

The Six Harmonies:
- First Spring and First Autumn form a pair,
- Second Spring and Second Autumn form a pair,
- Third Spring and Third Autumn form a pair,
- First Summer and First Winter form a pair,
- Second Summer and Second Winter form a pair,
- Third Summer and Third Winter form a pair.

First Spring begins to lengthen (*ying* means "to grow long"), First Autumn begins to shorten (*suo* means "to contract"). Second Spring begins to emerge, Second Autumn begins to withdraw—*emerge* refers to sowing in the second month; *withdraw* refers to harvest in the eighth month. Third Spring greatly emerges, Third Autumn greatly withdraws. First Summer begins to relax (*huan* means "ease," as in the fourth month’s yang tranquility), First Winter begins to intensify (*ji* means "urgency," as in the tenth month’s cold severity). At the solstice of Second Summer, the sun reaches its northernmost point; at the solstice of Second Winter, it reaches its southernmost point—*short* and *long* both precede the solstice. In Third Summer, virtue is complete; in Third Winter, punishments are complete—*virtue complete* means yang’s power has borne fruit; *punishments complete* means legal cases are concluded.

Thus:
- If governance fails in the first month, cool winds will not arrive in the seventh month;
- If governance fails in the second month, thunder will not retreat in the eighth month;
- If governance fails in the third month, frost will not descend in the ninth month;
- If governance fails in the fourth month, freezing will not occur in the tenth month;
- If governance fails in the fifth month, hibernating creatures will emerge in the eleventh month;
- If governance fails in the sixth month, plants and trees will not shed their leaves in the twelfth month—*not shed* means leaves wither but remain on the branches, failing to fall;
- If governance fails in the seventh month, the first month will suffer unrelenting cold;
- If governance fails in the eighth month, thunder will not sound in the second month;
- If governance fails in the ninth month, spring winds will not cease in the third month—*cease* means "to halt";
- If governance fails in the tenth month, plants and trees will not bear fruit in the fourth month—*bear fruit* means "to grow";
- If governance fails in the eleventh month, hail and frost will fall in the fifth month;
- If governance fails in the twelfth month, the six grains will grow wildly in the sixth month—*grow wildly* means to bear fruit without flowering.

When spring enacts summer’s mandate, it leaks—an image of exuberant yang dispersing. When it enacts autumn’s mandate, it brings water—water is born in *shen* (the ninth Earthly Branch), hence water. When it enacts winter’s mandate, it becomes stern—an image of qi’s severity.

When summer enacts spring’s mandate, it brings wind—an image of spring’s abundant wood qi. When it enacts autumn’s mandate, it brings desolation—an image of autumn’s withered growth. When it enacts winter’s mandate, it becomes obstructed—*obstructed* means "divided," an image of winter’s severed punishments, where grace and favor fail to flow downward.

When autumn enacts summer’s mandate, it blossoms—an image of summer’s flourishing trees. When it enacts spring’s mandate, it flourishes—an image of spring’s burgeoning growth. When it enacts winter’s mandate, it withers—*wither* means "to fall and scatter."

When winter enacts spring’s mandate, it leaks—an image of spring’s spreading dispersal. When it enacts summer’s mandate, it brings drought—an image of scorching yang.

When autumn enacts autumn’s mandate, it brings mist—autumn’s qi is yin, hence the chaotic fog.

The Great System of Yin and Yang comprises six measures:
Heaven is the *plumb line*,
Earth is the *level*,
Spring is the *compass*,
Summer is the *balance*,
Autumn is the *square*,
Winter is the *weight*.

The *plumb line* serves to align all things.
*Align* means "to correct."
The *level* serves to level all things.
The *compass* serves to encircle all things.
The *balance* serves to balance all things.
The *square* serves to square all things.
The *weight* serves to weigh all things.

The *plumb line* as measure:
straight yet not contentious,
long yet not exhausted,
enduring yet not worn,
distant yet not forgotten.
In virtue it joins with Heaven,
in clarity it joins with the divine.
What it desires is attained,
what it detests vanishes.
From ancient times to the present,
it cannot be altered or deflected.
Its power is most precise,
vast and all-embracing.
Thus the Supreme Lord makes it the root of all things.
*Root* means "foundation."

The *level* as measure:
even yet not treacherous,
impartial yet not biased,
vast and all-embracing,
generous and harmonious,
soft yet not weak,
sharp yet not broken.
*Sharp* means "keen."
*Broken* means "to snap."
Flowing yet not stagnant,
*Flowing* means "moving."
*Stagnant* means "to halt."
Easy yet not corrupt,
penetrating and well-ordered.
*Ordered* means "guided by the Way."
Perfectly contained yet not leaking,
level and never failing,
all things are made even,
the people harbor no treacherous schemes,
resentment and malice do not arise.
Thus the Supreme Lord makes it the leveler of all things.
*Level* means "to correct"—read as the *evenness* of judgment.

The *compass* as measure:
revolving yet not blocked,
encircling yet not tangled.
*Blocked* means "obstructed."
*Tangled* means "entwined."
Gentle yet not indulgent,
vast and accommodating.
With reason it moves and stirs,
with order it penetrates.
Calm and unhurried,
no grievances arise.
*Calm and unhurried* describes its ease and spaciousness.
When the compass’s measure is not lost,
the qi of life is set in order.
The types of qi are regulated and made clear.

The *balance* as measure:
unhurried yet not delayed,
even yet not resented,
bestowing yet not claiming virtue,
consoling yet not demanding.
It constantly levels the people’s emoluments,
supplementing what is insufficient.
Vibrant and flourishing,
it acts only in accord with virtue.
Nurturing growth and transformation,
all things thrive and prosper,
the five grains mature,
borders are filled.
When its governance does not err,
Heaven and Earth become luminous.
*Luminous* means "ordered."

The *square* as measure:
solemn yet not perverse,
firm yet not confused,
taking yet not resented,
inward yet not harmful.
Majestic and stern yet not intimidating,
its commands are executed without fail.
When killing and punishment are justly applied,
enemies are subdued.
When the square’s measure is not lost,
all punishments are obeyed.

The *weight* as measure:
urgent yet not excessive,
lethal yet not cruel,
filled to abundance,
perfectly contained yet not leaking.
It destroys yet does not seize,
executes for crimes yet does not pardon.
Sincere and steadfast,
unyielding and resolute.
It hopes to eliminate harsh wickedness,
and cannot be bent.
Thus when winter’s governance is about to be enacted,
it must weaken the strong,
must soften the rigid.
When the weight’s measure is not lost,
all things are stored away.

The system of the Hall of Light:
at rest, it models the *level*;
in motion, it models the *plumb line*.
Spring governs with the *compass*,
autumn governs with the *square*,
winter governs with the *weight*,
summer governs with the *balance*.
Thus dryness, dampness, cold, and heat arrive in proper season,
sweet rain and fertile dew descend in due time.

**Surveying the Hidden**

Surveying the Hidden observes the origins of dark and mysterious transformations. When utmost essence moves Heaven, it penetrates without limit—hence the title *Surveying the Hidden*, by which this chapter is named.

In ancient times, Master Kuang played the melody *White Snow*, and numinous beings descended in response. Violent winds and sudden rains assailed the land; Duke Ping fell gravely ill, and the state of Jin was scorched by drought. *White Snow* is the name of a melody played on the fifty-stringed zither of the Great One. Numinous beings refer to those transformed by the divine—such as black cranes arriving, or headless ghosts brandishing spears in dance. Duke Ping was the son of Duke Dao of Jin, named Biao. His grave illness was called *□-disease*. *Red earth* signifies drought. Only a sagely ruler could master such portents and avert disaster. Duke Ping’s virtue was meager, and he could not endure it; thus he fell gravely ill, and great drought ensued.

A lowly woman cried out to Heaven, and thunder and lightning struck down the terrace of Duke Jing. His limbs were broken, and the sea surged forth. This woman, a humble widow of Qi, childless and unwed, served her mother-in-law with utmost reverence. The mother-in-law, having no son but only a daughter, coveted her daughter’s wealth and ordered her to remarry the widow. The widow refused, so the daughter murdered her mother and framed the widow. Unable to clear her name, the widow’s grievance rose to Heaven, which answered with thunder and lightning, shattering Duke Jing’s terrace. The terrace crumbled, his limbs were maimed, and the sea overflowed its bounds.

Now, the blind musician and the lowly woman held the basest of ranks, their authority lighter than a feather. *Shang* means "to preside"; *xi* refers to *xi’er*, a kind of vegetable. In You and Ji, it is called *tan cai*; in the Luo region, *hu xi*. Those who preside over such matters hold the most insignificant offices. The blind musician and the lowly woman were even lower in rank than those who oversaw such trifles—hence their authority was said to be lighter than a feather. Yet by concentrating their essence, steeling their will, and accumulating spirit, they ascended to the Nine Heavens, rousing the utmost essence. The Nine Heavens are the eight directions and the center. Through sincerity and devotion, they moved it.

From this, we see that Heaven’s judgment is inescapable. Though one may hide in desolate wastes, remote and concealed, buried deep in stone chambers, or shielded by perilous barriers, there is no refuge. *Heaven* refers to the Supreme Emperor, whose divine clarity is absolute. It means that even if one conceals or flees their crimes, they will still be punished. Thus, there is no escape.

When King Wu campaigned against Zhou, he crossed the Meng Ford, and the waves of Yang Hou surged against the current to strike him. Yang Hou was the marquis of Lingyang, whose state bordered water. He drowned, and his spirit became capable of summoning great waves to harm others—hence the name *Yang Hou’s Waves*. Fierce winds and darkening skies obscured men and horses from one another. Then King Wu grasped the yellow battle-axe in his left hand and the white yak-tail banner in his right, glared fiercely, and brandished them, declaring: *"I bear the mandate of all under Heaven—who dares oppose my will?"* At once, the winds stilled, and the waves subsided. *Ji* means "to cease."

Duke Yang of Lu waged war with Han, and as the battle raged into dusk, he raised his halberd and beckoned the sun, which retreated three *she*. Duke Yang was a county lord of Chu, grandson of King Ping of Chu and son of Sima Ziqi—known in the *Guoyu* as Duke Wen of Lu Yang. Though Chu had usurped the title of king, its county governors were still called dukes, hence *Duke Yang of Lu*. The present-day Lu Yang in Nanyang is the same place. *Han* refers to the moment when battle reaches its climax. Beckoning the sun caused it to retreat three *she*. A *she* is a day’s lodging.

To preserve one’s nature and safeguard truth, never harming one’s person—when pressed by dire peril, one’s essence communicates with Heaven. As for those who have never strayed from their origin, what could they not accomplish? *Essence communicating with Heaven* refers to the sage whose inherent nature aligns with the celestial, thus receiving Heaven’s aid. *Origin* is the root of the Dao—meaning one’s nature does not stray outward, and life remains in harmony with the Dao.

Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overpowered. A single warrior, valiant and fierce, may become the hero of three armies. *Wu* means "warrior"; in the Jiang-Huai region, warriors are called *wu*. Such men seek only fame, yet even those who bind themselves to a purpose achieve such feats—how much more so those who take Heaven and Earth as their palace, embracing the myriad things? *Embracing* means to enfold, as in a sack. They befriend the workings of creation—creation being the interplay of yin and yang—and treat it as a companion. They contain the utmost harmony, outwardly resembling human form, yet within, they hold the great Dao. They observe the Nine and penetrate the One, knowing what is unknown. The *Nine* are the Nine Heavens; the *One* is the tortoise. By observing the changes of the Nine Heavens and divining the cracks in tortoise shells, even the unknown becomes as clear as stone. Yet their hearts never die. *Hearts that never die* refers to those whose minds are born in harmony with the Dao, not like those who merely observe the Nine and penetrate the One.

Long ago, Yongmen Zi visited Lord Mengchang with his weeping. Yongmen Zi, named Zhou, was skilled in the zither and renowned for his weeping. Yongmen was the western gate of Qi; he lived nearby and took it as his surname. *Weeping* here is akin to singing; *visited* means to move. Lord Mengchang was Tian Wen, the prime minister of Qi. After Yongmen Zi spoke, pouring out his heart and raising his voice, Lord Mengchang sighed deeply, his sobs uncontrollable, tears streaming down in torrents. *Zeng* means "repeated"; *jue yi* signifies a loss of voice. *Lang li* means "crossing and crisscrossing." *Jue* is pronounced like the *yang* in *yuanyang*; *yi* like the *yu* in *yin yu* from the *Zuozhuan*. When spirit takes form within, it outwardly conveys sorrow to the human heart—this is the untransmittable Dao. It means that through sincerity and grief, one can move another’s heart in ways that cannot be learned, hence the *untransmittable Dao*. If an ordinary person, ignorant of their lord’s bearing, were to mimic his expression, they would surely be ridiculed.

The "lordly form" refers to the utmost essence taking shape. Thus, Pujuzi could strike birds at a hundred *ren* in the sky—Pujuzi was a man of Chu, skilled in archery; seven *chi* make one *ren*. And Zhan He could lure fish in the great abyss—Zhan He was a man of Chu versed in the arts of the Dao. It speaks of his skill in angling, making fish rush toward the hook, hence "luring fish." They both attained the Dao of purity and tranquility, the harmony of the Great Vastness. For the resonance of things, subtle and profound, lies beyond the reach of knowledge to discuss or eloquence to unravel.

Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine brims over—the east wind is the wind of wood, and *zhan* wine is clear wine. As things descend and settle, it is called *zhan*. The sour taste of wood enters the wine, causing it to ferment and overflow, for things of a kind resonate. Silkworms chew silk and the *shang* string snaps, for some influence moves them. Old silkworms spin silk from their mouths, hence "chewing silk." New silk is brittle, and the *shang* note, the finest and most urgent of the five tones, thus breaks. *Er* may also be written as *earrings*—when silkworms age, the silk within their bodies turns yellow, appearing externally like earrings. *Shang* is the metal tone of the west, while the silkworm is the fire of *wu*. Fire in its prime restrains metal, so it responds only to *shang*, or perhaps it is the resonance of old and new. Drawings follow ash as the moon wanes, and when the whale dies, comets appear, for some movement stirs them. *Yun* is read as *encirclement* in *lianwei*. *Yun* means military—when armies besiege one another, the moon’s encirclement appears. If one draws a circle with reed ash beneath the moonlight and leaves one side open, the moon’s encirclement above will likewise wane. The whale, a great fish stretching several *li*, dies by the seashore. The fish’s body is base, while the comet is an omen of calamity, a harm to man—things of a kind move one another.

Thus, when the sage holds office, embracing the Dao without speech, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. The sage practices the natural and effortless Dao, so his blessings reach all. When lord and minister are at odds, deceit appears in the heavens, for spirit and qi respond, and signs manifest. The five-colored qi beside the sun, when they emerge outward on both sides, are called *bei* (turning away); outward-facing is *jue* (deceit), inward-facing is *er* (earrings), and when they emerge above, it is called *guan* (crown). Thus, mountain clouds resemble grass and trees, water clouds resemble fish scales—the qi of mountains forms clouds like vegetation, while the qi of water forms clouds like fish scales. Drought clouds resemble smoke and fire, while flood clouds resemble waves—each takes the form of its kind, thus moving one another. Drought clouds, born of scorching yang, resemble smoke and fire. *Cen* means great accumulation of water; clouds arising from *cen* resemble waves.

The yang burning-mirror draws fire from the sun, and the *fangzhu* gathers dew from the moon—*fu* is read as in *dafu* (grandee), as explained above. Another saying holds that water and fire derive from the Great Ultimate, present in man’s hands, yet beyond comprehension. Between heaven and earth, even the most skilled reckoner cannot enumerate their number. *Qiao* means skilled—between heaven and earth, the resonances of things are myriad, and even those skilled in calendrical arts cannot exhaust their count. The hand grasps in an instant, yet cannot seize their light. Though the hand may grasp at things in a fleeting moment, it cannot capture their brilliance. Another saying holds that the Dao of heaven is vast; though the hand may grasp at the formless and fleeting, it cannot seize the light of sun and moon.

Yet within the palm’s grasp, drawing things into the Great Ultimate above—the Great Ultimate is the time when heaven and earth first took shape; *above* means *beginning*—water and fire can be instantly summoned, for yin and yang share qi and move one another. *Move* means *transform*. This is why the tradition speaks of riding the tail of *Chen*—it tells how King Wuding of Yin dreamed of a worthy man, had artisans depict his likeness, and sought him far and wide, finding Fu Yue at Fu Rock, whom he made his minister. Fu Yue then composed the eighty-one tallying omens for Gaozong, bringing about a revival. In death, his spirit lodged in the star *Chenwei*, also called *Ce*.

Thus, utmost yin whispers, and utmost yang blazes. When the two intertwine and harmonize, the myriad things are born. If there were only males without females, what transformation could bring forth creation? This is the eloquence of silence, the Dao that cannot be spoken.

Thus, to summon the distant, act without acting—the distant are the four barbarians. To transform the distant lands, one must practice non-action, and the barbarian wastes will come of their own accord. To draw near those close, act without trouble—the near are the central states. To bring near those close, one must be without trouble, and those nearby will naturally attach themselves. Only those who walk in the night can possess this. *Walking in the night* is a metaphor for acting in darkness—acting through spiritual transformation, one can possess the world. Another saying holds that entering the Dao is like walking in darkness; only thus can one possess the way to summon the distant and draw near the close.

Thus, turn back the horses to manure the fields, and the ruts of chariots will not reach beyond distant lands—this is a saying of Laozi. Stop the horses from running and use them only for manure, the effect of practicing utmost virtue. Another saying holds that when a ruler lacks the Dao, warhorses breed in the wilds; without trouble, one stops the running horses to manure the fields, so the ruts of war chariots do not reach beyond distant lands. The space between two wheels is called a *rut*.

This is called sitting still while galloping, sinking while floating, brightening the night and darkening the day—sitting still yet acting through spiritual transformation, swifter than couriers; sinking and floating, darkening and brightening, in harmony with the Dao. To melt glue in winter or make ice in summer—of the Dao, there is no partiality in approach or departure. The capable have abundance, the clumsy fall short. It speaks of melting glue out of season or making ice in summer, tasks difficult to accomplish. The Dao of heaven is impartial in approach and departure; those who practice the Dao achieve more than enough.

Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. It is like the Pearl of Marquis Sui or the Jade Disc of Bian He—those who gain them grow rich, while those who lose them fall into poverty.

Marquis Sui was a vassal of the Ji clan in the state of Handong. Once, he saw a great serpent wounded and severed, so he applied medicine to heal it. Later, the serpent carried a large pearl from the river to repay him, and thus it was called the Pearl of Marquis Sui, also known as the Luminous Moon Pearl. Bian He of Chu found a raw jade in the mountains of Jing and presented it to King Wu. The king showed it to a jade appraiser, who dismissed it as mere stone, so the king had Bian He’s left foot cut off. When King Wen ascended the throne, Bian He presented it again, but it was still deemed stone, and his right foot was severed. Clutching the uncut jade, he wept blood. When King Cheng came to power, Bian He offered it once more. King Cheng said, “My predecessors took cutting off feet lightly but prized splitting stones.” He had the jade split open, and indeed, a fine piece of jade was found, which was fashioned into a disc—pure white and luminous in the night. This jade existed before the Spring and Autumn period, but since King Cheng did not record it, it was not documented.

The measure of gain and loss is profound and obscure, difficult to discern or debate. How do we know this? Consider the herb *dihuang*, which governs the bones, and licorice, which promotes flesh—if one demands that *dihuang* generate flesh or that licorice strengthen bones, it is like Wangsun Chuo hoping to double the dose of a medicine for partial paralysis to revive the dead. Such reasoning is surely flawed. Wangsun Chuo was a man of Zhou, said to be a descendant of Wangsun Jia of Wei. He claimed that a single dose could cure partial paralysis and sought to double it to revive the dead.

Just as fire can scorch wood, so too can it melt metal—this is the Way in action. Yet if one expects a lodestone to attract tiles as it does iron, it will prove difficult. Things cannot be judged by mere weight. The fire-drill draws flame from the sun, the lodestone draws iron, and crabs spoil lacquer—when crabs are placed in lacquer, it rots and fails to dry, becoming unusable. Sunflowers turn toward the sun, yet even the wise cannot make them do otherwise. Thus, the discernment of the eyes and ears is insufficient to fathom the principles of things, and the reasoning of the mind cannot settle right and wrong.

Therefore, those who govern by cunning struggle to maintain the state; only those who comprehend the Great Harmony and uphold the responses of nature can master it. When Yao Mountain collapses, the Boluo River runs dry—Yao Mountain lies in Yongzhou, while the Boluo River flows through Linjin in Fengyi, their depths interconnected. Some say the Boluo is the Jing River. When Ou Ye was born, the sword *Chunjun* was forged. *Ou* is pronounced like *ge’ou*. Ou Ye was a Yue man, a master swordsmith. *Chunjun* was an ancient, razor-sharp sword. When King Zhou of Shang indulged in tyranny, Zuo Qiang stood by his side—Zuo Qiang was a flattering minister who encouraged the king’s excesses. Yet Taigong lived in the same era, and thus King Wu’s achievements were established.

From this, we see that the paths of advantage and harm, the gates of fortune and misfortune, cannot be sought or attained. Their thresholds cannot be known in advance. They arrive suddenly, escaping all form.

The Dao and virtue are like rawhide and tanned leather—when you seek to distance yourself, they draw near; when you draw near, they recede. Leather’s essence mirrors the Dao, while rawhide’s essence mirrors virtue. If you wish to distance yourself from the Dao, it remains at your side; if you seek it through effort, it withdraws far from you. Those who act without contrivance are close to others; those who act with contrivance grow distant.

Without grasping the Dao, one gazes at the minnow—visible in the water yet unattainable, just as the Dao is. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither sending off nor welcoming, responding without concealing. The mirror reflects beauty or ugliness without hiding anything. Thus, the myriad transformations proceed without harm.

Those who claim to have attained it have already lost it; those who admit to losing it may yet attain it. To believe one has grasped the Dao is to have already lost it; to believe one has lost the Dao is not necessarily to be without it.

Consider the tuning of strings: strike the *gong* note, and the *gong* string resonates; pluck the *jiao* note, and the *jiao* string vibrates—this is the harmony of like sounds. Strike the great *gong*, and the lesser *gong* responds; pluck the great *jiao*, and the lesser *jiao* stirs. Thus, like tones harmonize. Yet if one adjusts a single string so that it no longer aligns with the five notes and strikes it, all twenty-five strings resonate—this is not because the sound differs, but because the ruler of tones has taken form. That single string is the *gong* note, the ruler of tones, so all twenty-five strings harmonize. Another interpretation: adjusting one string so it no longer matches the five notes is tuning it to the *gong* sound, hence it is said to be “not different from sound.” The five notes are governed by this single tone, so the ruler of tones has manifested.

Those who comprehend the Great Harmony are as if in a sweet slumber, drunk and at ease, wandering within it without knowing how they arrived. The Great Harmony refers to the harmony of life and death, the equality of poverty and prosperity. Within it lies the center of the Dao, yet one does not know how one came to be there. Utterly immersed, dull and dazed to the end, as if never having left their origin—*chun* means unity, *wen* means harmony, *lun* means sinking, a metaphor for concealment. *Dunmen* means without emotion, desiring to begin and end in the Dao. *Zong* means origin, as if form had never existed. This is called the Great Penetration.

Now, when the red *chi* and blue *qiu* dragons roam Jizhou, the sky is clear and the earth is still; venomous beasts do not stir, and birds do not take fright. They enter the thickets, feeding on *jianmei*—*jianmei* is a grass fruit resembling mulberries, red in color, growing by the riverside.

Tasting sweetness in their mouths, they never step beyond the bounds of fields and acres, yet serpents and eels scorn them, deeming them unfit to contend in the rivers and seas. *Zanwei* means long and fine. Serpents and eels believe themselves superior to the red *chi* and blue *qiu* dragons.

When at last the dark clouds gather at dawn—*xuan* means black, *su* means white—black clouds rise and converge in the bright morning. Yin and yang clash in strife, descending in a whirlwind, mingling with freezing rain. *Jiang* means to descend; *fufeng* is a fierce gale; *dongyu* is a torrential downpour. They surge upward in a spiraling ascent, riding the wind and rain away. Their might shakes heaven and earth, their roar resounds across the four seas, so that all within them stand in awe.

Serpents and eels bury themselves in mud a hundred *ren* deep—a *ren* is seven hundred feet, and *ren* also denotes the depth of waves, as the saying goes, "measured in *ren* for ditches and channels." Bears and brown bears crawl among jagged peaks, tigers and leopards slink into their dens and dare not roar. *Xi* means to enter; *pao* means to howl. Gibbons and langurs stumble and lose their grip on the branches—*you* is pronounced like *yi* in the phrase "to bestow a gift" from the people of Zhongshan. *You* refers to a kind of gibbon with a long tail and upturned nose. How much less, then, could mere serpents and eels compare?

When the phoenix soars, it is the advent of supreme virtue—the male is called *feng*, the female *huang*—a sign of a ruler of utmost virtue come to alight. Thunder does not rumble, wind and rain do not arise, rivers and valleys do not overflow—*dan* means to flood. The grasses and trees stand still, yet swallows and sparrows mock them, thinking themselves too nimble to vie with the phoenix in the vastness of the cosmos. Swallows and sparrows believe their own agility surpasses that of the phoenix. *Jiao* may also be written as *xiao*, meaning to cry. *Yu* refers to the eaves of a house, *zhou* to its ridgepole, as the *Yi* says, "Above, the ridgepole; below, the eaves."

Yet when the phoenix ascends to the heights of ten thousand *ren*—*ceng* means high, *shi* means to fly, or to turn—soaring beyond the four seas—*wai* means beyond. One wing rising and falling is called *ao*, gliding without movement is called *xiang*. It passes the *Shupu* gardens of Kunlun, drinks from the rushing rapids of *Dizhu*—*Shupu* lies atop Kunlun; *guo* means to traverse. *Dizhu* is a narrow stretch of the Yellow River, east of Dayang in Hedong. *□* is swift water, *lai* is clear, both describing swift, surging currents. It circles the islets of *Mengsi*—*zhanhui* means to linger, *Mengsi* refers to the source of a river where water spills forth, then returns to form an islet. An islet is a small sandbar. Lingering at the borders of Jizhou, it crosses *Duguang*, enters the land of *Yijie*—*nie* means to reach; *Duguang* is a mountain in the southeast, where the myriad spirits ascend and descend. It is said that the phoenix passes the wilds of *Guangdu*, escorting the sun to the land of *Yijie*, illustrating the vastness of its flight. *Nie* may also be written as *jue*, meaning to traverse; *jing* means to pass; *jue* means to cross.

Its wings skim the Weak Waters, and at dusk it roosts in the Wind Cave, bathing its feathers upon the Weak Waters. The Wind Cave is where the cold north wind issues from the earth. At this time, swans, cranes, and storks all cower in terror, fleeing to hide, pressing their beaks to the riverbanks—*zhuihui* means their beaks press to the ground, motionless. *Yi* means edge. How much less could mere swallows and sparrows compare?

This reveals those who understand the traces of small movements yet remain ignorant of the source of great principles.

In ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu drove their chariots—Wang Liang was a grandee of Jin who served as charioteer to Wuxu, known as the skilled driver Liang. Also called Sun Wuzheng, he drove for Viscount Jian of Zhao and, after death, his spirit ascended to the star Tian Si, the star Wang Liang in the celestial charts. Zaofu, of the Ying clan, was a descendant of Boyi and son of Feilian, who served as charioteer to King Mu of Zhou—upon mounting the chariot and taking up the reins, the horses stood in perfect order and harmony. *Zhengqi* means without deviation; *lianxie* means the horses’ bearing and limbs were well-coordinated. Their steps were evenly measured, their exertion and rest as one—*yi* means unity of heart. Their spirits were joyful, their qi harmonious, their bodies agile and swift—*bi* means quick. At ease with labor and delighting in progress, they galloped as if vanishing—*mie* means to disappear, describing their speed. Turning left and right as if guided by a whip—*zuoyou* refers to the outer horses; the force of their steps was as if whipped. Another interpretation: the ease of wielding the whip to instruct them. Circling like a ring, as if following the driver’s will. The world regarded them as masters of their craft, yet their true worth remained unseen.

But when Qian Qie and Tai Bing drove—these two were charioteers of the Great Unity. Another interpretation: ancient adepts of the Dao who guided yin and yang with spirit and qi—they cast aside reins and bits, discarded whips and goads. The chariot moved of its own accord without being driven, the horses ran of their own will without being urged. They merely relied on the chariot and horses as vessels, their spirit and qi sustaining them. The sun traveled, the moon shifted, stars gleamed and the heavens turned—*yao* means to shine; *xuan* means the sky; *yun* means to move. Lightning bolted and ghosts leapt. Advancing and retreating, bending and stretching, no trace or boundary was visible—*zhen* means sign; *yin* means form. Thus, they did not beckon or shout, yet outpaced the returning geese at Mount Jieshi—describing the speed of their driving, arriving at their destination before the geese, which were then sent north to Jieshi, where the passing geese were overtaken. *Guo* is read as "to surpass." They overtook the *kuji* at Guyu—*yi* means to surpass from behind. Guyu is a mountain in Wu; *kuji* is another name for the phoenix. It is said that their driving was so swift that after passing the geese at Jieshi, they turned southeast and overtook the *kuji* at Guyu. They raced as if flying, dashed as if vanishing, treading upon the wind, chasing the whirlwind home—*zong* means to tread; swift as an arrow. *Nie* means to step. Another interpretation: the arrow was behind, unable to catch up, hence the word *zong*.

Their movement was swift, able to overtake an arrow—this is what *nie* describes. They pursued the *biao* and caught it. *Biao* refers to light with a shadow within. Suddenly, they returned, all reaching this point—speaking of their speed. They set out at dawn from *Tuan Sang* and entered the sun at *Luo Tang*. *Tuan Sang* is where the sun rises; *Luo Tang* is a mountain name, where the sun sets. This describes how non-action achieves its use. *Fei yong* means non-action. It was not through the scrutiny of thought or the skill of hands and claws, but rather that desires took shape in their hearts while their spirit harmonized with the six horses—this is governing by non-governing. It speaks of concealing the form of desires within the breast. *Yu* means harmony. Governing by non-governing means governing through the arts of the Dao.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the world, with Li Mu and Tai Shan Ji assisting him. Li Mu and Tai Shan Ji were the Yellow Emperor’s teachers. Mencius said, "The king’s teachers are his ministers." They regulated the movements of the sun and moon, *lü* meaning measure. They governed the *qi* of yin and yang, moderated the measures of the four seasons, corrected the calculations of pitch-pipes and calendars, distinguished male and female, differentiated the sexes, clarified hierarchy, ranked nobility, ensured the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few, and the people preserved their lives without premature death—securing their nature and destiny without early demise. The seasons ripened without calamity—*bu xiong* meaning no disasters. The hundred officials were upright and selfless, all acting for the public good. Above and below were in harmony without grievance—rulers and ministers in accord, without fault. Laws and commands were clear and not obscured; assistants were impartial and not sycophantic; ministers and officials were just, not bending to private interests. Farmers did not encroach on boundaries; fishermen did not contend over deep pools—*wei* being the secluded depths where fish gather. No one picked up lost items on the road; markets did not engage in speculative pricing; city gates were not barred—*guan* meaning closed. Villages had no thieves; travelers in the countryside deferred to one another with their wealth, speaking of having abundance. Dogs and pigs spat out beans and grain on the roads without stirring quarrels. Thus, the sun and moon were bright and clear, the stars did not deviate from their courses, wind and rain came in season, the five grains ripened, tigers and wolves did not recklessly bite, birds of prey did not recklessly strike, phoenixes alighted in the courtyards—*xiang* meaning to rest—and qilin roamed the outskirts—*you* meaning to move. The outskirts were beyond the city. The Azure Dragon advanced to draw the chariot; the *Fei Huang* crouched in the stables. *Fei Huang* is the *Cheng Huang*, emerging from the west, shaped like a fox with horns on its back, living a thousand years. *Zao* means stable.

The states of Zhu Bei and Dan Er all presented their tributes and duties—both being northernmost barbarian lands. Yet even this did not match the Dao of Fu Xi. In ancient times, the four pillars collapsed, the nine provinces split—*lie* meaning divided; *fei* meaning broken. Heaven did not fully cover, earth did not completely bear. Fire blazed fiercely without extinguishing; water surged boundlessly without receding—*xi* meaning to subside. Fierce beasts devoured the innocent people—*zhuan* meaning good—and birds of prey snatched the old and weak—*jue* meaning to seize. Then Nü Wa smelted the five-colored stones to mend the azure sky. Nü Wa was a yin emperor, assisting Fu Xi in governance. During the Three Sovereigns’ era, heaven was deficient in the northwest, so she mended it—so the masters say. She severed the turtle’s legs to prop up the four pillars. *Ao* is a giant turtle. With heaven broken, she used the turtle’s legs as pillars. The *Chu Ci* says, "The turtle bears the mountain below—how could it be stable?" She slew the Black Dragon to aid Jizhou. The Black Dragon was the essence of water. Li Mu and Tai Ji killed it to stop the rain—*ji* meaning to assist. Jizhou was among the nine provinces, referring to the present lands within the four seas. She piled up reed ashes to halt the flooding waters. Reeds grow in water, so she amassed their ashes to stop the floods. Flooding waters rise from flat ground. The azure sky was mended, the four pillars set right, the flooding waters dried, Jizhou leveled, vicious creatures died, and the innocent people lived. *Chong* means beasts. Facing the square earth, embracing the round heaven, harmonizing spring’s warmth and summer’s heat, restraining autumn’s severity and winter’s harshness, resting the head on a square pillow and sleeping straight—*fang* being a four-inch carpenter’s square. *Qin sheng* means lying straight. Where yin and yang were congested and blocked, she opened the passages; where rebellious *qi* and perverse things harmed the people with their thick accumulation, she severed and halted them. *Ni qi* means chaotic *qi*.

The hoarded wealth that harmed the people and creatures—thus she severed and halted it.

At that time, she slept in tranquil repose and rose with vacant gaze. *Juju* means sleeping without thought or care; *ju* is read as the emptiness of *xu*. *Mianmian* describes a look devoid of cunning or guile. Some took themselves for horses, others for oxen; their gait was stumbling, their gaze dim. *Dian* is read as the *tian* of *tianyan*. All, in their simplicity, attained harmony, knowing not whence it arose. They wandered aimlessly, seeking nothing, and specters knew not where to go.

In that era, birds and beasts, vipers and serpents—none failed to conceal their claws and fangs, to hide their stings and venom, for none harbored intent to rend or devour. Assessing her meritorious deeds, above they reached the Nine Heavens, below they matched the Yellow Loam. Above, they joined the Nine Heavens; below, they harmonized with the Yellow Loam—the Yellow Springs beneath hold the earth’s loam. *Lu* is read as the *lu* of *shenglu*.

Her fame resounded through later ages, her radiance outshone the myriad things, lending luster to all. She rode a thunder chariot, yoked to a responding dragon, flanked by azure *qiu*. The central pair were the *fu* steeds; the outer, the *can*. Those with horns were dragons; those without, *qiu*. Another account holds that the responding dragon was a winged dragon. She grasped auspicious omens, spread the *luo* charts as her mat—the *jue* pearls of fortune she drew to herself. The charts were arrayed as her seat. Another account says the *luo* charts were the chariot’s seat.

Yellow clouds enveloped her, a white *chi* led before, and a darting serpent followed behind. *Luo* is read as the *lu* of *daolu*, referring to the chariot’s trailing adornments. Yellow cloud-qi wreathed her chariot; the white *chi* guided ahead. The *benshe* was a soaring serpent, trailing behind—all auspicious signs.

Wandering at ease, she communed with ghosts and spirits, ascended the Nine Heavens—the Nine Heavens being the eight directions and the center. She paid court to the Emperor at the Spirit Gate, attending the Supreme Emperor at the Spirit Gate. Serene and harmonious, she rested beneath the Great Ancestor—*mi* means tranquility; *mu*, harmony; *xiu*, repose. The Great Ancestor is the great lineage of the Dao.

Yet she did not display her merits nor proclaim her fame—*zhang* and *yang* both mean to make manifest. She concealed the Way of the Perfected Person, following the inherent nature of Heaven and Earth. *Yin* means to hide; the Perfected Person is one of true virtue. *Gu* means natural. Why? The Dao and virtue reached upward, and cunning and artifice vanished. For wisdom is but craft and deceit.

By the time of Xia Jie, the ruler was benighted and unenlightened, the Dao neglected and unrefined. The ways of benevolence and righteousness were no longer cultivated—hence it is said to be *lanman*. He cast aside the grace and punishments of the Five Emperors, overturned the legal records of the Three Kings. Thus, the utmost virtue perished and was not exalted; the imperial Dao was obscured and did not rise. *Xing* means to elevate.

His actions defied the Azure Heaven, his decrees ran counter to the four seasons. *Li* means to oppose. Spring and autumn withdrew their harmony; Heaven and Earth stripped away their virtue. *Suo* means to withdraw—speaking of harmony no longer prevailing. His deeds grew daily more vile, yet he knew it not—hence it is said their virtue was stripped away.

The benevolent ruler held his position in unease; the great officers concealed the Dao and remained silent. They did not bring peace to the people, nor did they remonstrate with forthright counsel on the Way of benevolence and righteousness. As the *Analects* says: "When the state lacks the Dao, one acts with peril and speaks with caution."

The assembled ministers gauged the ruler’s will and harbored compliance. *Zhun* means to observe; *huai*, to ponder; *dang*, to align. They sought to match the ruler’s intent, no longer offering upright admonition through the Dao. They distanced their kin and secured their own positions. The wicked formed cliques, scheming in secret—*yinmou* means private plotting. Dwelling between ruler and minister, father and son, they vied to indulge the ruler’s arrogance and follow his whims. They sowed chaos to accomplish their ends.

Thus, ruler and minister grew estranged and unclose; kin became distant and unattached. The sacred pole withered, the altar split—speaking of the failure to offer proper sacrifice to the spirits.

The Hall of Demeanor trembled and collapsed—this hall, where rites of conduct were observed, now could not perform its rituals, so the celestial patterns quaked and brought it to ruin. Packs of dogs howled and plunged into the abyss, for the realm was on the verge of destruction, and the dogs, having lost their masters, wailed as they fled into the depths. Another interpretation: this speaks of canine omens. Pigs dragged their bedding into the shallows, clutching their mats as they entered the coves—speaking of porcine omens. Another interpretation: they carried their bedding to hide in seclusion.

Beautiful women tore at their hair and blackened their faces, no longer presentable—*ná* means disheveled, their hair and grass woven together in wild tangles. They abandoned all adornment. With voices once melodious, they swallowed charcoal to silence their song, their breath stifled and still. *Mànshēng* refers to their fine singing. Seeing the world in chaos and mourning its impending ruin, they marred their voices with charcoal and ceased all movement. Mourning was not carried out to its full sorrow, nor was the joy of the hunt ever heard—speaking of an age in turmoil where rites had crumbled, so that grief was never fully expressed, and the pleasures of the chase were no longer enjoyed.

The Western Elder broke her *shèng*-ornament; the Yellow Spirit wailed in lament. The Queen Mother of the West snapped the *shèng* she wore upon her head, for the age had lost all law and measure. The spirit of the Yellow Emperor grieved the decline of the Dao, sighing and moaning in long sorrow. Birds stretched their wings in vain; beasts abandoned their limbs—*duànyì* means to let their wings hang limp; *fèijiǎo*, to hobble and limp. This spoke of Jie’s tyranny, his hunts so frequent and reckless that birds and beasts were all wounded, their wings broken, their legs maimed.

Mountains had no towering trunks; marshes held no deep waters—*jùn gàn* referred to fine timber; *wā shuǐ*, to still pools. This spoke of mountains and marshes no longer flourishing in their season. Foxes and badgers burrowed into their dens; horses and oxen wandered astray. Fields bore no standing grain; roads grew no *suōfán*—*suōfán* is read like *fán* in "monkey’s paw," resembling *zhēn*, which in turn resembles the *duàn* tree. *Suō* is the name of a grass.

Gold piled high lost its edge; jade discs were buried without pattern—*qi* of metal amassed until its sharpness was blunted. *Bì* referred to its veins; *xí*, to its layers. This spoke of overuse, all becoming dull and devoid of grain or order. *Bì* is read as *pì*. The tortoise-shells of divination were hollowed out—*qìng* means empty, like the hollow of a sounding stone. The shells were drilled repeatedly for augury, so their bellies were worn through. This spoke of Jie’s tyranny: he abandoned virtue and benevolence, relying solely on divination, yet no auspicious omens appeared. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Holding millet, he goes forth to divine—how can he find good fortune?"* And again: *"My tortoise is weary, it no longer reveals the way."* The *Shī* stalks were scattered. The *Book of Changes* says: *"To divine again and again is to profane; profaned, it will not respond."*

In the late age, the Seven States belonged to different clans, and the feudal lords established their own laws, each with distinct customs. *Wǎnshì* refers to the time after the Spring and Autumn period, the end of the Warring States. The Seven States were Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, Wei, and Qin. The Qi clan was Tian; the Chu, Xiong; the Yan, Yao; the Zhao, Zhao; the Han, Han; the Wei, Wei; and the Qin, Ying—hence, different clans. Vertical and horizontal alliances divided them, armies clashed in mutual struggle. Su Qin forged the Vertical Alliance; Zhang Yi, the Horizontal. South and north united in the Vertical; east and west, in the Horizontal. Thus it was said: when Vertical and Horizontal took shape, Qin would become emperor.

They attacked cities, slaughtered the besieged, toppled the high, and secured the perilous. They desecrated tombs, exposed the bones of the dead, deployed great siege engines, and raised towering mounds. *Chōngchē* were massive iron-tipped battering rams, horses armored, chariots armed, used to breach enemy walls. In ancient times, when punishing disrespect, they would seize the great fish and gather the bones of the slain, heaping earth over them to form *jīng* mounds—hence, *"towering ramparts"* referred to these *jīng* mounds. They cleared paths for battle, smoothed roads for the dead, challenged formidable foes, and annihilated the unjust. Of a hundred who marched forth, one returned—this was a fleeting, hollow glory. It spoke of a hundred soldiers going to war, all perishing save one who made it back. Another interpretation: of a hundred who marched, one returned victorious.

Thus, the strong and swift-footed were made into armored troops—*jiǎ* means interlaced. Those in chariots were called *shì*; those on foot, *zú*. A thousand *lǐ* away, the old and weak at home wept in sorrow. Servants, grooms, and stablehands pushed supply carts bearing provisions—*sī* means laborers; *tú*, the multitude. Oxen were called *fàng*; horses, *yǔ*. *Fǔ* means to push; *xiǎng*, to supply rations. *Fǔ* is read like *fǔ* in *"jí fǔ."* The roads were long, frost and snow fell relentlessly, coarse hempen garments were threadbare—*duǎnhè* referred to those clad in rough cloth, *duǎn* sometimes written as *duǎn*. *Hè* was woven from animal hair, like today’s horse blankets. *"Not complete"* spoke of the people’s destitution. Men grew emaciated, chariots broke down, mud rose to their knees. They dragged one another along the road, their heads drooping in exhaustion—*xié* means to pull; *fèn shǒu*, to describe the people, worn by labor, collapsing on the road, barely able to shake their heads. This spoke of utter exhaustion, hence *"fèn shǒu."*

They died with their heads resting on the flogging frame—*gé* was the rack for beatings. It spoke of those who could not complete their labor or taxes, bound to the rack and left to die, hence *"resting their heads on the frame."* Thus, those who conquered lands left tens of thousands of corpses, thousands of shattered chariots. The wounded—pierced by bows, crossbows, spears, halberds, arrows, and sling-stones—were carried along the roads. So the age came to this: men slept on piles of heads, ate human flesh, pickled human livers, drank human blood, and savored it like fine livestock. *Gān* means to relish.

Thus, since the Three Dynasties, the world had never known a time when people could rest in their true nature, delight in their customs, preserve their allotted span, and live out their days without being cut short by human cruelty. *Nüè* means harm. Why was this so? The feudal lords waged war with force, and the world was united into one household. By the present age, the Son of Heaven sat upon the throne—here, a sigh for Emperor Wu of Han. He governed with the Dao and virtue, aided by benevolence and righteousness. Those near offered their wisdom; those far cherished his power. With folded hands and a wave of his arm, the Four Seas submitted in homage. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, all presented their tributes. The world was blended into one, *hùn*—united.

Descendants succeeded one another—this was how the Five Emperors aligned with the celestial virtue. The sage cannot bring forth the times; he awaits their arrival and does not let them slip away. He assists with capable ministers, suppresses the seeds of slander and flattery, silences the rhetoric of cunning persuasion, abolishes harsh and carving laws, removes vexatious and petty affairs, bars the traces of slanderous speech, shuts the gates of factional cliques, and eliminates cleverness and skill—eradicating the ability of cunning and artifice.

He cultivates the Great Constancy, dismantles peripheral branches, restrains keen perception, discards petty cleverness, and merges great desires into unity. In great penetration and profound obscurity, he unbinds the mind and releases the spirit, becoming so serene as to seem devoid of soul or spirit, allowing the myriad things each to return to their root. This is the path of cultivating the traces of Fuxi and reverting to the Dao of the Five Emperors—*fǎn* means to return.

Jianqu and Tai Bing did not employ bridle or bit yet were renowned throughout the world for their skill in driving; Fuxi and Nüwa did not establish laws and regulations yet left behind perfect virtue for later generations. Why was this so? Because they attained utter emptiness, pure unity, and did not engage in *dié-dié* petty affairs—*dié-dié* meaning deep calculation, referring to the avoidance of adopting vexatious and petty matters.

The *Book of Zhou* says: "Though the pheasant is not caught, one should follow the wind and comply with its principle." Whether something is feasible or not, one should always take the Dao and virtue as the foundation, thereby critiquing the failures of the laws of Shen and Shang.

Now, as for the governance of Shen, Han, and Shang Yang—Shen refers to Shen Buhai; Han, to Han Fei; and Shang Yang, to Gongsun Yang—the methods of these three were all carving and harsh laws. They plucked out the roots, abandoned the fundamentals, and did not thoroughly investigate the sources from which things arose. How did it come to this? They chiseled the Five Punishments, enacted harsh and carving laws, turned their backs on the root of the Dao and virtue, and contended over the tip of an awl or knife—*the tip of an awl or knife* being a metaphor for petty gains, meaning they exhausted all in contention.

They reaped and cut down the common people, exhausting more than half—*reaping and cutting down the common people* being a metaphor like grass and trees, meaning they did not nurture them. *Dān* means to exhaust; *tài bàn* means more than half.

Yet they remained self-satisfied, ever convinced of their governance—*xīnxīn* describes the manner of one pleased with oneself and full of pride. This is like embracing firewood to extinguish a fire, or chiseling a hole to drain water. A well planted with catalpa will not admit a jar; a ditch planted with willows will not bear a boat—within three months, they must perish. *Zhí* refers to timber; when rafters are set beside a ditch, they sprout into willow shoots. This is used to illustrate the laws of Shen, Han, and Shang Yang, likening them to catalpa and willow. Why is this so? They are all wild growths without root.

The Yellow River winds nine bends on its way to the sea yet its flow never ceases, for it draws from the Kunlun’s supply. *Zhé* means to curve. Rainwater that does not drain, spreading wide and stretching to the horizon, will dry and parch within ten days if no rain falls—it is water that receives but has no source. *□* refers to swift torrents from rain, hence it is said to have no source. *□* is pronounced like *chì* in the speech of the people of Yan.

It is like Yi begging the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, yet Chang’e stole it and fled to the moon—Chang’e was Yi’s wife. Yi sought the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, but before he could consume it, Chang’e stole and ate it, attaining transcendence and ascending to the moon as the moon’s essence. Some texts write *bènròu* instead of *bēn yuè*, meaning the elixir could revive dead flesh as if it were living meat. Yi was left despondent, as if bereaved, with no means to restore it. It is said that Yi was dismayed and disheartened, as though he had lost something irreplaceable, unable to recover the elixir of immortality. Why? Because he did not know the source from which the elixir of immortality arose. Yi did not know the origin of the elixir of immortality. Shen, Han, and Shang Yang’s cohort failed to grasp the root of governance, like one begging for medicine.

Another interpretation: Yi believed his fate lay in the elixir, unaware that fate resides in Heaven, hence he sought to know the source of the elixir of immortality. Thus, begging for fire is not as good as taking flint; borrowing water is not as good as digging a well.

**The Training of Essence and Spirit**

Essence is the qi of humanity; spirit is the guardian of humanity. Tracing to its origin and expounding its meaning, it is thus called "essence and spirit," and so the chapter is titled.

In the time before Heaven and Earth existed, there was only formlessness—*wei* means "to ponder." It speaks of the time before Heaven and Earth took shape, when there was no form. Once form arose, Heaven and Earth were completed.

Vast and obscure, boundless and indistinct, murky and expansive—none knew its gate. All were the qi of unformed chaos. *Mang* is read as the *mang* in "jade wilderness"; *weng* is read as [the missing character] in "[missing] extinction"; *min* is read as the *min* in "Min Ziqian"; *hong* is read as the *xiang* in "Zi Gong"; *dong* is read as the *tong* in "traveling together." All are images of nothingness, hence it is said none knew its gate.

Two spirits emerged in primordial union, traversing Heaven and ordering Earth. These two spirits are the deities of yin and yang. "Mixed birth" means they arose together. Profound and fathomless, none knew their ultimate end; vast and boundless, none knew where they would cease. *Kong* describes depth; *tao* describes greatness.

Thereupon they separated into yin and yang, dispersed into the eight directions, and through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things took shape. *Li* means "to scatter"; the eight directions are the extremities of the eight poles. Hardness and softness are yin and yang.

Disordered qi became insects; refined qi became humans. Thus, essence and spirit belong to Heaven, while bones and flesh belong to Earth. Essence and spirit enter their gate, while bones and flesh return to their root. Essence and spirit are formless, so they can enter the gate of Heaven; bones and flesh are formed, so they return to their root and revert to earth. What then remains of me? It means that when humans die, each returns to its place—how can I alone endure?

Therefore, the sage models himself on Heaven and follows nature, unbound by custom or swayed by others. *You* means "to be deluded." He takes Heaven as his father and Earth as his mother, yin and yang as his warp, and the four seasons as his weft. Heaven is still and clear; Earth is settled and tranquil. The myriad things perish when they lose this, and live when they emulate it.

Stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and clarity; emptiness and nothingness are where the Dao resides. Thus, those who seek it externally lose it internally, while those who guard it internally lose it externally. It is like the root and the branches: if you draw from the root, the thousand branches and ten thousand leaves will follow without fail.

Essence and spirit are what one receives from Heaven, while form and body are what one is endowed with from Earth. Thus it is said: "One gives rise to two, two gives rise to three, and three gives rise to the myriad things." One refers to the Dao; two refers to spirit and clarity; three refers to harmonious qi. Another interpretation: one is primordial qi; two are Qian and Kun; two give rise to three, and three give rise to the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take their positions, yin and yang flow freely, and the myriad things are born. The myriad things turn their backs to yin and embrace yang, with harmonious qi as their mediator. They turn their backs (the spine) to yin and their bellies to yang; the hollow within the body is where harmonious qi circulates.

Yin is why the kidneys are paired; yang is why the heart stands alone. Yin, yang, and harmony together generate physical form—just as ruler and minister achieve great peace through harmony. Thus, in the first month, it is like cream, beginning to nurture; in the second month, it takes shape; in the third, it becomes an embryo; in the fourth, flesh forms; in the fifth, sinews develop; in the sixth, bones harden; in the seventh, it is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the body is formed, the five viscera take shape.

Thus, the lungs govern the eyes—the lungs resemble the Vermilion Bird, and the Vermilion Bird is fire. Fire manifests externally, hence it governs the eyes. The kidneys govern the nose—the kidneys resemble the tortoise, and the tortoise is water. Water flows through channels, just as the nose conducts qi, hence it governs the nose. The gallbladder governs the mouth—the gallbladder is where the brave make decisions, hence it governs the mouth. The liver governs the ears—the liver is metal, and metal manifests internally, hence it governs the ears.

The exterior serves as the surface, while the interior serves as the wrapping; opening and closing, expanding and contracting, each follows its own order. *Xi* is read as "flank."

Thus, the roundness of the head resembles Heaven, and the squareness of the feet resembles Earth. There are the four seasons, the five phases, the nine divisions, and the three hundred sixty-six days. The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The nine divisions refer to the nine tens making one division. Another interpretation: the nine divisions are the six ones that combine and divide. Another interpretation: the eight directions and the center make nine divisions. The year has three hundred sixty-six days, and humans likewise have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty-six joints.

Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat, and humans likewise have taking and giving, joy and anger. Thus, the gallbladder becomes clouds—the gallbladder is metal, and metal and stone give rise to clouds, hence it becomes clouds. The lungs become qi—the lungs are fire, hence they become qi. The liver becomes wind—the liver is wood, and wood generates wind, hence it becomes wind. The kidneys become rain—the kidneys are water, and water gives rise to rain. (Another reading: rain or lightning. The kidneys are water, and water generates light, hence they become lightning.) The spleen becomes thunder, aligning with Heaven and Earth, while the heart governs them. The heart is earth, hence it governs the four phases.

Thus, the ears and eyes are the sun and moon, and blood and qi are wind and rain. Within the sun is the crouching crow (*cun* means "to crouch," referring to the three-legged crow); *cun* is read as in "Cun Wei." Within the moon is the toad—the toad is a frog. When the sun and moon lose their course, they are eclipsed and dimmed; *bo* means "to press close." *Bo* is read as in "offering meagerly." When wind and rain come unseasonably, they destroy and break, causing disasters. When the five stars lose their course, the states and regions suffer calamity. The five stars are Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, and Saturn.

Now when Mars encroaches upon Horn and Neck, the states and regions suffer its calamity—this applies to all such cases.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth, vast even at its crescent, still moderates its radiance and cherishes its numinous brightness. How then can human ears and eyes endure prolonged strain without rest? *Rest* means cessation. How can the spirit and essence sustain ceaseless galloping without exhaustion? *Exhaustion* means depletion.

Thus, blood and qi are the bloom of humanity, while the five viscera are the essence. When blood and qi concentrate within the five viscera—*concentrate* means unity—and do not scatter outward, the chest and abdomen become full and desires diminish. When the chest and abdomen are full and desires diminish, the ears and eyes become clear, and hearing and vision become penetrating. When the ears and eyes are clear and hearing and vision penetrating, this is called illumination. When the five viscera align with the heart without discord, then the will prevails and conduct remains unswayed. *The will prevails* refers to one’s guiding resolve. *Unswayed* means uncorrupted. *Prevails* may also be read as *pursues*, meaning the guiding resolve may depart slowly, thus keeping conduct upright and free from corruption. When the will prevails and conduct remains unswayed, the spirit flourishes and qi does not dissipate. When the spirit flourishes and qi does not dissipate, there is coherence; coherence leads to balance, balance to penetration, penetration to the numinous. When numinous, one sees all without obstruction, hears all without impediment, and accomplishes all without fail. Thus, cares and troubles cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot invade. *Invade* means to follow or enter.

Therefore, some seek what lies beyond the four seas yet cannot obtain it—*obtain* means to attain—while others guard what lies within their own form, their hearts free from desire, yet do not perceive it. Hence, those who seek much gain little, and those who perceive the vast know but little.

The apertures are the doors and windows of the spirit, while qi and will are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. When the ears and eyes indulge in the pleasures of sound and color, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled. When the five viscera are agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not cease. When blood and qi surge without ceasing, the spirit gallops outward and does not remain within—this is due to excessive desires, causing the spirit to fail in inward guard. When the spirit gallops outward and does not remain within, then blessings and misfortunes arrive like mountains, yet one cannot recognize them. *Mountains* symbolize greatness. *Recognize* means to know.

If the ears and eyes are keen, profound, and free from allurement, if qi and will are empty, tranquil, and joyful while desires are diminished, if the five viscera are settled, serene, full, and not depleted, and if the spirit guards the form within and does not scatter outward, then gazing into the past or foreseeing the future would still not suffice—*still* means *yet*, and *suffice* means *to govern*. How could this be limited merely to discerning blessings and misfortunes?

Thus it is said: the farther one reaches outward, the less one knows. This speaks of those who, though they may know the Dao, remain deficient. It illustrates that the spirit must not be allowed to stray outward.

Therefore, the five colors confuse the eyes, causing them to lose clarity—*lose clarity* means dimmed vision. The five sounds deafen the ears, causing them to lose acuity—*lose acuity* means hearing nothing. The five flavors disorder the mouth, causing injury and impairment—*impairment* means illness, harm to the sense of taste. Preferences and aversions disturb the heart, causing conduct to become reckless. *Disturb* means disorder; *reckless* means deviating from proper measure.

These four are what the world uses to nourish life—*life* means *to live*—yet they are all human burdens. Thus it is said: desires cause human qi to scatter—*scatter* means loss—and likes and dislikes cause the human heart to labor—*labor* means affliction. If not swiftly abandoned, the will and qi daily dissipate—*dissipate* means disorder.

Why is it that people cannot fulfill their natural lifespans and instead perish midway through punishment and execution? It is due to their excessive indulgence in life. What does *excessive indulgence in life* entail? It means nothing less than extreme desires, boundless indulgence without satiety, harming the ears, eyes, emotions, and nature. Thus they do not fulfill their lifespans but perish midway under the execution of lawless violence.

Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to can truly cultivate and attain life. Those who do not treat life as something to be clung to lightly regard the pursuit of profit and harm, removing the desires of emotion and nature—thus they long preserve life.

Heaven and Earth revolve and interconnect; the myriad things unite as one. *Unite* means to converge; *one* means sameness. The myriad things converge and are governed by the one Dao. Those who know the one know all things—*the first one* is the Dao, *the second one* is things. Those who do not know the one cannot know anything.

Consider my place in the world: I too am but one thing. Do I not know whether the world uses me to complete its things, or whether, in the absence of me, things are not already complete? Thus, I am also a thing, and things are also things. Between things and things, how can one thing be distinguished from another? Things are also things—why name them as things?

Nevertheless, in giving me life, what benefit does it confer? *Giving life* is the natural Dao—what benefit should it provide? In taking my life, what harm does it inflict? *Harm* means diminution. Since the Creator has already made me a vessel, there is nothing to oppose. This means that once made human, there is nothing to depart from—it illustrates that one neither seeks nor avoids.

How do I know that those who seek life through acupuncture and moxibustion do not err? And how do I know that those who seek death by hanging or cutting their throats do not find fortune? Perhaps life is but forced labor, and death but rest? In this vast world, who can truly know?

When I am given life, I do not insist on its continuance—*continuance* meaning cessation. This is to say, I do not despise life. When I am taken by death, I do not insist on its cessation. This is to say, I do not fear death. Those who desire life do not strive for it—*strive* meaning to manage. Those who detest death do not reject it, for they follow what is right and thus do not refuse. They scorn me, yet I feel no hatred; they honor me, yet I feel no joy. When others despise me, I do not hate them. When others revere me, I do not rejoice. I follow my natural endowment and rest in it without urgency—*endowment* meaning time, or else nature; *urgency* meaning haste. This illustrates that the Daoist does not hastily seek life.

In life, I possess a seven-foot form; in death, I return to a coffin’s worth of earth. My existence among the realm of forms is like my death’s dissolution into the formless—*dissolution* meaning entry. Thus, my life does not increase the multitude of things, nor does my death thicken the earth. How then can I know what to delight in or detest, what to deem beneficial or harmful? I do not know the benefit of delighting in life, nor the harm of detesting death, for I abide in my true nature.

The Creator seizes and draws forth things—*seizes* meaning to gather; *draws forth* meaning to pull—just as a potter works clay. The clay taken from the earth to make vessels differs not from the clay still in the ground. Once shaped into vessels, they may shatter and dissolve, returning to their origin. The potter, the official who crafts earthenware, molds the clay taken from the earth into vessels. This makes clear that one should not despise death, for death is but a return to the state before life—like a shattered vessel returning to earth. In this, it differs not from the clay that became a vessel.

In a riverside village, people draw water to irrigate their gardens, yet the river does not resent it. In a filthy household, they drain their ditches into the river, yet the stagnant water does not rejoice. Thus, when in the river, it differs not from irrigating the garden; when in the ditch, it differs not from being in the river. The Dao values emptiness and honors the formless. The river is vast, its departure imperceptible, so it does not resent. The ditch is small, its departure swift, so it does not rejoice—*stagnant water* like still water. *Filth* means haste. Another interpretation: each rests content in its place, and when they transform, there is neither resentment nor joy.

Thus, the sage adapts to the times and rests content in his position, delighting in his work in the present age—*work* meaning affairs. Grief and joy are deviations of virtue; delight and anger are excesses of the Dao; love and hatred are outbursts of the heart. Therefore, it is said: in life, one moves with the heavens, like the qi of heaven. In death, one transforms with things, like the changes of things. At rest, one closes with yin; in motion, one opens with yang. The spirit remains serene and boundless—*boundless* meaning without end. It does not scatter with things, yet the world naturally submits—*scatter* meaning disorder; *submits* meaning submits to virtue.

Thus, the heart is the master of the form, and the spirit is the heart’s treasure. If the form labors without rest, it stumbles—*stumbles* meaning to fall. If essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore, the sage honors and reveres it, daring not to transgress.

The Xia-hou clan’s jade half-disc—stored in a sealed casket—was treasured to the utmost. A half-disc is called a *huang*, a precious jade. Yet the treasure of spirit surpasses even the Xia-hou’s *huang*. *Surpasses* meaning not merely.

Thus, the sage responds to being with non-being, exhausting its principles; receives the solid with emptiness, penetrating its limits. Serene and joyful, empty and still, they fulfill their destiny. Therefore, they are neither overly distant nor overly intimate, embracing virtue and warming harmony to follow heaven. *Warming* means to roast; warming harmony in fire to align with the Dao of heaven. *Warming* is read as *yang*, like the *yang* in "nourishment."

They join with the Dao as their boundary, dwell beside virtue as their neighbor. *Boundary* means union; *neighbor* means proximity. They do not initiate fortune nor precede misfortune. The hun and po reside in their abode, while spirit guards its root. Life and death bring no change to them—hence they are called *perfect spirit*. *Change* means disturbance.

The so-called *True Person* aligns their nature with the Dao. The True Persons are Fu Xi, the Yellow Emperor, and Lao Dan. Thus, they possess yet seem without; are full yet seem empty. Abiding in oneness, they know not duality; governing the inner, they recognize not the outer. *Governing the inner* means guarding the spirit; *recognizing the outer* means not indulging in love or hatred.

They comprehend the Great Simplicity, practice non-action to restore simplicity, embody the root and embrace spirit to wander within heaven and earth’s bounds. *Bounds* means limits; *bounds* is read like the *fan* in "steamed rice." Vaguely they roam beyond the dust and grime, drifting in the work of non-action. Vast and unbounded, the craft of mechanisms does not burden their heart.

Thus, though death and life are great indeed, they do not alter. *Do not alter* means equating death and life. Though heaven and earth nurture all, they do not cling to them. *Cling* means grasping; they do not forcefully hold to heaven and earth’s nurturing of the myriad things, preserving their pure harmony.

They discern the flawless and do not mingle with things. *Flawless* means fault; it describes the appearance of resisting profit and desire. Able to discern and follow, they do not intermingle with things. Perceiving disorder in affairs, they yet guard their origin. *Origin* means root. Seeing things arise, they halt them; chaos cannot delude, so they guard their origin.

Thus, they rectify the liver and gall, forsake the ears and eyes—speaking of spirit’s inner guard. The heart’s will focuses within, penetrating duality to unite with the One. *The One* is the Dao. They dwell without knowing what they do, move without knowing where they go—speaking of the will unshackled. Vastly they depart, freely they arrive. *Vastly* describes turning movement; *freely* means without purpose, wandering without aim. *Freely* is read like the *lü* in "green robe"; *vastly* like the *hui* in "the great pearl’s brilliance."

Their form is like withered wood, their heart like dead ashes. *Withered wood* has no breath; *dead ashes* have no heat—metaphors for non-action. They forget their five viscera, diminish their bodily frame. They know without learning, see without gazing, accomplish without acting, discern without governing.

They respond to stimuli, move under compulsion. *Compulsion* means unavoidable movement, then they act. They proceed only when necessary, like light’s radiance, like a reflection’s projection, following the Dao as their guide, awaiting conditions to be so. *Guide* means decision; following the Dao to await the myriad things—hence they say "awaiting," yet remain silent thus.

They embrace the Great Purity’s root and admit no attachments—no attachments to emotions or desires. Thus, things cannot disturb them. *Disturb* means delusion; one says *disorder*. Vast and desolate, empty and still, they harbor no thoughts, do not labor the spirit.

Great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be hot; the Milky Way may dry, yet they cannot be cold; great thunder may shatter mountains, yet they cannot be startled; great winds may darken the sun, yet they cannot be harmed. This speaks of those who embody the Dao: closing emotions and guarding emptiness, even these four great forces cannot delude them.

Thus, they regard treasures, pearls, and jades as mere pebbles; view the most exalted and lavish honors as passing travelers. *Most exalted* refers to emperors and kings—hence *lavish honors*; *passing travelers* are like wayfarers on the road. They see Mao Qiang and Xi Shi as grotesque. Mao Qiang and Xi Shi were ancient beauties. *Grotesque* means misshapen; the *fangxiang* spirit’s four golden eyes and vermilion robes are rare, inhuman visages—yet their likeness is but misshapen eyes and faces, speaking of extreme ugliness.

They regard death and life as one transformation, the myriad things as one kind. *Kind* means category. Uniting essence with the Great Purity’s root, they wander beside the indistinct realm. *Indistinct realm* means the vague, formless region.

They possess essence yet do not employ it; possess spirit yet do not move—speaking of not polluting their essence or laboring their spirit. They join with the Great Simplicity’s uncarved block and stand at the Perfect Purity’s center. *Uncarved block* means substance; *Great Simplicity* describes its undispersed state. *Great Simplicity* is read like the *hui* in "brilliant chapter."

Thus, in sleep they do not dream; their wisdom does not sprout. *Do not dream* means spirit guards within; *wisdom does not sprout* means no thoughts arise. Their po is not repressed, their hun does not soar. *Po* is the yin spirit; *hun* is the yang spirit. Yin is not sunken or repressed; yang does not fly or soar—each guards its abode.

Revolving through beginning and end, they know not the thread’s start. They sweetly slumber in the Great Night’s abode. *Great Night* means the long night’s midst—speaking of their direct repose in the great Dao’s realm, darkly seeing the luminous. Yet they awaken to gaze upon the luminous world, rest in the corner without crooks, and roam the wilds without bounds. *Corner without crooks* and *wilds without bounds* describe the formless, obscure state.

Thus, they rectify the liver and gall, forsake the ears and eyes—speaking of spirit’s inner guard. The heart’s will focuses within, penetrating duality to unite with the One. *The One* is the Dao. They dwell without knowing what they do, move without knowing where they go—speaking of the will unshackled. Vastly they depart, freely they arrive. *Vastly* describes turning movement; *freely* means without purpose, wandering without aim. Their form is like withered wood, their heart like dead ashes. They forget their five viscera, diminish their bodily frame. They know without learning, see without gazing, accomplish without acting, discern without governing. They respond to stimuli, move under compulsion. They proceed only when necessary, like light’s radiance, like a reflection’s projection, following the Dao as their guide.

Dwelling without form, abiding without place—their person resides where no shape can be seen, abides where no fixed location exists. Their movement leaves no trace, their stillness no substance; no trace, no substance—such is the appearance of the Dao. Existing yet seeming to vanish, living yet seeming to die, they enter and exit without gap, command ghosts and spirits—speaking of their power of transformation. Though humans do not share form with ghosts, they can employ them—this is the Dao. Heavenly spirits are called *shen*; human spirits, *gui*.

They merge into the unfathomable, penetrate the seamless, for they transmit through forms that differ. *Shan* means transmission. The forms of the ten thousand things differ, yet the Dao transmits and gives them life. Beginning and end form a circle, none can grasp its principle. *Lun* means pattern, the Dao—none can attain it. This is how the spirit ascends to reach the Dao. *Jia* means to arrive, to ascend to the Dao.

Thus it is the realm where the Perfected Person wanders. *You* means to travel. Like the breath of exhalation and inhalation, expelling the old and drawing in the new; like the bear’s hanging and the bird’s stretching, the wild duck’s bathing and the ape’s leaping, the owl’s gaze and the tiger’s glance—these are the practices of those who cultivate the body, not to disturb the heart. *Jing* means to sway; *shen* means to stretch frequently. Such are the body-cultivators who guide their spirit, bending and extending, leaping and bounding—this is not the Dao of the Perfected Person. *Gu* means disorder. These methods of body-cultivation are not enough to disturb the heart of the Perfected Person.

They let the spirit roam freely without losing its fullness. *Chong* means repletion. Day and night unharmed, they bring springtime to all things—one with the person who embodies the Dao. *Day and night* symbolize harm; *unharmed* means no injury is done. *Bringing springtime to all things* means nurturing them, thus uniting with the generative force of the seasons and transforming the heart. If so, they harmonize with the Dao, letting the four seasons transform their heart—meaning they do not oppose the times to harm things.

Moreover, humans may alter their form without harming the heart. *Jie* means preparation; the human body is fully equipped. *Jie* may also be written as *ge*, meaning change—speaking of the body’s transformations. The heart symbolizes the spirit, which remains unharmed. Though the dwelling may decay, the essence is not consumed. *Zhui zhai* means the body; when the spirit resides in its dwelling, life exists; when it departs, death follows. Yet though the person dies, the spirit is never exhausted—thus it is said, "the essence is not consumed."

The leper’s gait does not change, the madman’s form is not diminished—the spirit is about to migrate far, who has time to know what it does? The leper’s form lives while the spirit remains, so their gait does not change. *Jie* may also mean armored; in ritual, the armored do not bow but can still walk—thus it is said, "does not change." The madman’s body remains intact—thus it is said, "not diminished"—but the spirit scatters and strays, so it is said, "the spirit is about to migrate far."

Thus the form may perish, yet the spirit never transforms. *Mo* means destruction, like death. The spirit’s change returns to the formless—thus it is said, "never transforms." *Hua* means death. Responding to transformation without transforming, through ten thousand changes and countless shifts, it never reaches an end. *Not transforming* refers to the spirit; *transforming* refers to the body. The dead become ashes and dust—this is called *hua*. *Hua* means returning to the formless; *not transforming* means being born together with heaven and earth.

When a tree dies, its greenness departs. Yet what makes the tree live—is it the tree? What makes the tree live is heaven—thus it is said, "is it the tree?" So too is the one who fills the form not the form. The one who fills the form is *qi*—thus it is said, "not the form." Therefore, that which gives life never dies; what it gives life to dies. *That which gives life* is the Dao. The person who embodies the Dao is like heaven’s *qi*—it never dies. What it gives life to are the ten thousand things.

That which transforms things never transforms; that which transforms things is the Dao. The Dao does not transform—thus it is said, "never transforms." What it transforms does transform. What it transforms are the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things change—thus it is said, "does transform."

Disregarding the world, the spirit is unburdened. To treat the world’s honors and powers as trivial—like Xu You—is to keep the spirit free from entanglement with things. Seeing the ten thousand things as insignificant, the heart is not confused. Equating life and death, the will is not daunted. *Qi* means to equalize. Not fearing righteous death, not delighting in unrighteous life, the will has nothing to dread—thus it is said, "to equalize." Harmonizing with change, clarity is not obscured. *Xuan* means confusion. The multitude may call my words empty, but I will cite examples to make them real.

What delights people about being a ruler is the ability to exhaust the desires of the ears and eyes and satisfy the body’s comforts. Now, lofty towers and layered pavilions are what people admire—*tai* means a high platform on all sides; *xie* means a wooden structure atop it. *Li* means beauty. Yet Yao’s rafters were unhewn, his plain crossbeams unadorned. *Pu* means uncarved; *jue* means rafters. They were not planed, only smoothed with stone. The plain crossbeams were not decorated—thus it is said, "unadorned," meaning no brackets were applied. *Jī* is read as *jī* (like "chicken perch"), or may be written as *guā* (to scrape). Rare treasures and strange wonders are what people cherish, yet Yao ate coarse millet and drank soup of wild greens. *Lì* means coarse; *zī* means millet. *Lì* is read like the *lài* in *làishì* (to rely on); *zī* is read like the *qí* in *qīcuī* (mourning attire). Fine embroidery and white fox fur are what people desire, yet Yao wore rough cloth to cover his body and a deerskin to ward off the cold.

The tools for nurturing life were not made lavish, yet he added to them the burden of heavy cares. *Rèn* is read like the *rèn* in *rènxiá* (chivalrous). Thus he offered the world to Shun. *Chuán* means to abdicate.

As if shedding a heavy burden. It was not merely a matter of yielding the throne—truly, he had nothing to claim as his own. Such were the means by which he made light of the world.

When Yu inspected the southern regions and crossed the Yangtze, his tour of inspection was to observe the four quarters. *Jì* means to cross. A yellow dragon bore his boat upon its back, and the people aboard were struck pale with fear, their faces drained of color. Yu, however, smiled broadly and declared: "I received my mandate from Heaven and have exhausted my strength in toiling for the myriad people. *Láo* means to worry. Life is but a temporary lodging; death, a return. What is there to disrupt harmony? Human life rarely exceeds a hundred years—thus it is said, life is a lodging. Death is extinction, transformation, disappearance—thus it is called a return. *Gǔ* means disorder; *hé*, harmony.

He regarded the dragon as no more than a lizard—a *yǎntíng*, that is, a skink, or as some say, a gecko. Dongfang Shuo, in his riddle-guessing before the Martial Emperor, said: 'If it were a dragon, it would lack horns; if a snake, it would have feet.' With its sturdy gait and gentle gaze, fond of clinging to walls—it was no gecko, but surely a skink. Yet when Yu’s countenance remained unchanged, the dragon flicked its ears and wagged its tail in flight. *Táo* means to depart. Thus did Yu perceive things in their true measure."

The divine diviner of Zheng, Master Hú of the Lin clan, perceived his omens—when the spirit resides in a man, he is called a *xí*; in a woman, a *wū*. The *wū* could divine the auspicious or inauspicious *qi* through bone divination, thus discerning its signs. *Zhēng* means response.

He informed Liezi. Liezi went weeping to report to Master Hú. Liezi was a recluse of Zheng and a disciple of Master Hú. *Bào* means to inform. Master Hú held to Heaven and Earth, saying that spirit belongs to Heaven, while form and bones belong to Earth; in death, one returns to their origin—thus he spoke of holding to Heaven and Earth. Names and realities did not enter his concern. *Míng* refers to titles and ranks; *shí*, to gifts of silk and wealth. *Bù rù* means he paid them no heed. The trigger of danger arose from his heels. *Jī* signifies swiftness, meaning that when life was imperiled, death came before he could turn his heel—yet he felt no fear. Master Hú regarded death and life as equal. *Qí* means equivalence.

Zǐqiú, a man of Chu, sought to know his age at fifty-four, yet he was afflicted with a hunched back, his spine protruding above his head, his chest pressing against his chin, and his thighs positioned above. *Yǔlǚ* refers to the lower opening of the spine. *Gāo yú dǐng* means it rose above his head. *□* refers to the chest. *Pò* means it pressed against his chin. With his thighs below now above, his body was contorted. *□* is read as the dissipation of spirit, like the fading of *yuèwú*. His candle-like *yíng* pointed to the heavens. *Zhú* refers to the yin brilliance; *yíng*, to its opening. It pointed upward to Heaven. *Zhúyíng* is read as *kuòcuō*. He crawled to peer into a well, gazing at his reflection in the water. He said, "How wondrous is the Creator! Why has it made me thus, so constrained?" *Wěi zāi* means "how magnificent"; *zàohuà* refers to Heaven; *jūjū*, to a pleasing appearance. In this, his view of transformation was likewise equal.

Thus, observing Yao’s Dao, one knows the insignificance of the world—through his abdication to Shun. Witnessing Yu’s resolve, one knows the pettiness of the world—through his seeing a dragon as no more than a skink. Tracing Master Hú’s discourse, one knows the equality of death and life—through his holding to Heaven and Earth. Seeing Zǐqiú’s conduct, one knows the sameness of transformation—his crawling to peer into the well is what this means.

The perfected person leans upon an unshakable pillar and walks an unobstructed path—resting on a column that cannot be uprooted, traversing a road that cannot be barred, speaking of unimpeded passage. They draw from an inexhaustible storehouse and study under an immortal teacher, going nowhere without success, arriving nowhere without understanding. *Wú wǎng ér suì* means to proceed and succeed; *wú zhì ér tōng*, to arrive and understand. Life is not enough to preoccupy their mind, nor death enough to darken their spirit. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace their fate and flow with it—holding to Heaven’s mandate and turning with it, never departing from it. Amidst the ten thousand twists of fortune and misfortune, gain and harm, *zhěn* means to turn—what could trouble their heart?

Such a person embraces simplicity and guards their essence, shedding their form like a cicada or a snake, roaming the Great Purity, rising lightly and dwelling alone, vanishing suddenly into darkness. The phoenix cannot match their pairing—*lì* means to accompany—how much less the marsh sparrow? The sparrow of the marshes and lakes cannot fly beyond a moment’s dusk, a metaphor for weakness. Rank, position, titles, and emoluments—how could these sway their resolve? They are not enough to sway the perfected person’s will.

When Yanzi pledged an oath with Cuī Zhù, he faced death yet did not alter his righteousness. Yanzi, named Yīng, styled Píngzhòng, was a grandee of Qi. Cuī Zhù killed Duke Zhuang of Qi and forced the feudal lords to swear, "Whoever does not follow Cuī and Qìng shall face this oath." Yanzi said, "I will follow only what is loyal to the ruler and beneficial to the state—likewise, I will follow what benefits it." Thus it is said he faced death yet did not alter his righteousness.

When Zhí and Huá were about to die in battle, the Lord of Jǔ offered them rich bribes to stop, yet they did not change their conduct. Zhí was Qǐ Liáng; Huá, Huá Zhōu—both were knights of Qi. When they led an expedition against Jǔ, the men of Jǔ surrounded them, admiring their courage and offering lavish bribes to halt them, but they refused and died in battle. Thus it is said they did not change their conduct.

Therefore, Yanzi could be pressed by benevolence but not coerced by arms. When Yanzi refused Cuī Zhù’s oath and was about to be killed, he said, "Why do your halberds not hook, your night spears not shatter? I will not yield to unrighteousness." Thus it is said he could not be coerced by arms. Zhí and Huá could be stopped by righteousness but not tempted by profit. *Xiàn* means to regard—speaking of not being moved by gain. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be frightened by the threat of death. They act solely for righteousness and are not bound by things—how much more so for those who act without contrivance?

Yao did not value possessing the world, thus he abdicated to Shun. Gōngzǐ Zhá did not esteem ruling a state, thus he yielded his position. Zhá was the youngest son of Shòumèng of Wú, known as Jìzǐ of Yánzhōulái. He declined the throne and did not accept his elder brother’s state—*Chūnqiū* praised him. The sons of feudal lords are called *gōngzǐ*.

Kong Han did not regard jade as wealth, thus he refused the treasure. Kong Han was the sixth-generation descendant of Duke Dai of Song, the son of a scholar from the western district, named Le Xi, the Minister of Music. Someone from Song obtained a jade and offered it to Kong Han, who declined. The one who presented the jade said, "I showed it to a jade expert, who deemed it a treasure, so I dare offer it." Kong Han replied, "I regard not being greedy as my treasure, while you regard jade as yours. If you give it to me, we both lose our treasures. It is better for each to keep their own." The man bowed deeply and said, "A humble man carrying jade cannot travel beyond his village. I offer this to beg for my life." Kong Han placed it in his neighborhood, had a jade worker refine it, enriched the man, and then sent him back home. Thus it is said he did not accept the treasure.

Wu Guang did not harm righteousness for the sake of life, so he cast himself into the abyss. Wu Guang was a recluse during Tang’s time. When Tang succeeded Jie, he offered the world to Wu Guang. Someone told Wu Guang, "Tang killed his lord and will bring the name of unrighteousness upon you." Wu Guang then embraced a stone and threw himself into a deep abyss to die.

From this, we see that the most noble do not rely on rank—those of utmost virtue are esteemed, such as Xu You and Wu Guang. Thus it is said they do not rely on rank. The richest do not depend on wealth—those of utmost virtue are rich, like Jie Yu, the madman of Chu. The king heard of his worthiness and sent an envoy with a hundred *yi* of gold to invite him, wishing to make him a minister, but he refused. Thus it is said the richest do not rely on wealth.

The world is vast, yet one may give it to another—Yao is such a case. One’s own body is most intimate, yet one may cast it into the abyss—Wu Guang is such a case. Beyond these, nothing else is worth pursuing. "Beyond" means to exclude; "pursuing" means seeking profit. Some interpret it as "private," meaning exclusive possession. These are called men without encumbrances. Such men do not regard the world as valuable.

Looking up to the discourse of the utmost person and deeply exploring the meaning of the Dao and virtue, then examining the conduct of the common world below, one finds it truly shameful. "Examining" means observing. Thus, understanding Xu You’s intent, the *Jin Teng* and *Pao Tao* become obsolete. *Jin Teng* and *Pao Tao* are books of secret schemes by the Duke of Zhou and Jiang Taigong to seize the throne. Xu You disdained the world and did not accept it—why would he need such books? Thus they are obsolete. When Yanling Jizi refused the state of Wu, those who litigated over idle fields were ashamed. Those who litigated over idle fields were Yu and Rui, as well as Duke Bao Huan and Duke Su Xin. When Kong Han did not covet jade treasures, those who quarreled over contracts were shamed. When Wu Guang remained unstained by the world, those who greedily clung to life were confounded.

Thus, those who do not observe great righteousness do not know that life is not worth coveting. "Great righteousness" refers to dying for one’s lord or kin in peril. Those who do not hear great words do not know that the world is not worth pursuing. "Great words" are those that embody the Dao and lack desire.

Now, consider the village festivals of the poor and remote: they strike basins and clay jars, sing in harmony, and consider it joy. Yet if one were to beat the great war drum and strike the massive bell for them, they would feel discontented and ashamed of their basins and jars. "Discontented" describes their dejected appearance. Some write it as "lingling," meaning "to hear."

Those who store poetry and books and cultivate literature yet do not understand the essence of the utmost discourse are like those who strike basins and jars. For those who regard the world as their possession, learning is like the great war drum. High status and great profit are what people covet. "High status" means the highest position; "great profit" means substantial emolument. If one were to hold the world’s maps in the left hand while cutting one’s throat with the right, even a fool would not do it. From this, we see that life is more valuable than the world. The world is vast and cannot be held in the hand, so it is not spoken of as such. Even if one could hold the world’s registers, wield its power, and cut one’s throat to kill oneself, even a fool would not do it. Thus it is said life is more valuable than the world.

The sage eats enough to sustain qi, wears enough to cover the body, and satisfies desires without seeking excess. "Sustain" means to continue; "cover" means to clothe; "excess" means surplus. Possessing the world does not harm their nature, nor does lacking it make them envious of harmony. "Harm" means to damage; "envious" means to exceed; "harmony" means contentment. Having the world or not is the same in reality. "Reality" means equality.

Now, if one bestows upon a person the granary of Ao and the waters of the Yellow River—"bestows" means to grant; Ao is a place name, where the granary is always full, located north of present-day Rongyang County—when hungry, they eat from it; when thirsty, they drink from it. What enters their stomach is no more than a basket of food and a gourd of broth. Thus their body is full, yet the granary of Ao is not diminished, nor are the waters of the Yellow River exhausted. "Diminished" means reduced; "exhausted" means depleted. Having them does not make one fuller, nor does lacking them make one hungrier. It is the same as guarding one’s grain basket and possessing one’s well. "Basket" is a vessel for holding grain; "well" refers to the household’s well water. "Basket" is read like the first character of Zhuan Sun’s name.

Great anger harms the yin, great joy collapses the yang—this is already explained in the *Origin of the Dao*. Great sorrow causes internal collapse, great terror drives one mad. Eliminate filth and remove encumbrances, remain indifferent as if one had never left one’s origin, and one attains great freedom.

Clear the eyes yet do not use them to see, purify the ears yet do not use them to hear, seal the mouth yet do not use it to speak, entrust the heart yet do not use it to ponder. Discard brilliance and return to primal simplicity, rest the spirit and abandon cunning and knowledge. Awake yet seeming dim, alive yet seeming dead. "Dim" means dark or weary.

The people of Chu call "weary" *mei*; this refers to the state of non-knowing. In the end, one returns to the state before birth and becomes one with transformation. This speaks of the time before a person’s birth. One desires to equate death with life, hence the saying "becomes one with transformation." Death and life are of a single body.

Now consider the laborer who hoists his spade, dredges his fish trap, and carries his soil basket—*yao* means servitude. In Hedong, repairing roads is called *yao* roads. *Jie* means to lift; *jue* means to chop; *cha* is a plowshare. In Qingzhou, it is called a *hua*, for it has a blade. In the Three Adjuncts, it is called [a missing character]. The basket is a vessel for holding soil. Sweat and brine flow together, breath rasps at the throat. White sweat is salty like brine, hence called brine-sweat. *Bo* means pressing, as qi crowds the throat. At such a time, if one rests beneath the shade, one feels sudden joy. *Hao* means shade. In the Three Adjuncts, resting beneath a flowering tree is called *hao*. The people of Chu call a tree with a broad base and small top, shaped like a carriage canopy, a *yue*, for it provides ample shade. *Tuo* means relaxed. This speaks of the suspended laborer who gains a brief rest, so his qi is eased and he rejoices. *Yue* is read like the *yue* in "no double *yue*" in the classics.

In the recesses of caves, one does not merely rest in the shade. Those afflicted with illness or tumors clutch their hearts and press their bellies, bowing their heads to their knees. *Yi* means to press. *Kou* is sometimes written as *ju*, read like the *qu* in *chequ*. Curled up and still, they pass the night without sleep. At such a time, if they suddenly find rest, their kin and brothers rejoice with them. The peace of a full night’s rest is not merely the joy of a single moment’s respite. This speaks of attaining undisturbed sleep through the night. The joy of a brief respite cannot compare to the bliss of a long night’s rest.

Thus, one who knows the vastness of the cosmos cannot be coerced by life and death. *Jie* means coercion. One who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be swayed by the world. The harmony of nurturing life refers to the correct Dao. Having cultivated the correct Dao without confusion, one cannot be moved by the world’s dire circumstances. One who knows the joy of the time before birth cannot be frightened by death. Delighting in the state before birth, even if threatened with death, one does not fear it. This speaks of not fearing death. One who knows that Xu You was nobler than Shun does not covet things. This speaks of not coveting material desires or worldly gains.

A wall standing is not as good as it lying down; how much less so if it were never a wall at all? Ice frozen is not as good as it melted; how much less so if it were never ice? It is better than the time before the wall or ice existed, for lying down and freezing can change. From nonbeing to being, from being to nonbeing—from formless to formed, from formed to formless. Reaching formlessness refers to the transformations of life and death. Beginning and end have no origin; none know where they sprout. Without penetrating the external and internal, who can be free of likes and dislikes? Likes and dislikes are the emotions and desires.

Beyond the external is the greatest vastness; within the internal is the utmost nobility. This speaks of heaven having no outer limit yet being able to extend beyond it, illustrating its boundlessness. "Without internal" speaks of its smallness, for the smallest has no interior yet can contain an interior. The Dao values subtlety and mystery, hence it is called the utmost nobility. One who knows the greatest nobility goes nowhere without success. The greatest nobility refers to the innermost within. The Dao is so subtle that it can enter and exit without gaps, hence the saying "goes nowhere without success." *Sui* means to penetrate.

In a declining age, scholars flock to learning without understanding how to return to the origin of the heart and revert to the root. *Cou* means to flock. They rush toward the branches without studying the ancient canons, merely seeking fame and titles, hence the saying "without understanding how to return to the origin of the heart and revert to the root." They merely carve and polish their nature, suppress and distort their emotions, to engage with the world. *Zhi* means merely. They carve their innate nature and distort their true emotions to conform to世俗 and interact with others.

Thus, though their eyes desire something, they restrain themselves with measures; though their hearts delight in something, they temper themselves with ritual. They move with measured steps, bowing and scraping, their flesh congealed yet uneaten, their wine settled yet undrunk. Outwardly, they bind their forms; inwardly, they constrain their virtue. They clamp down on the harmony of yin and yang, forcing the true nature of life and destiny. Thus, they spend their lives as sorrowful beings. *Bei* means sorrowful, referring to the learning of a declining age.

Those who comprehend the ultimate Dao are not like this. They order their emotions and nature, govern their minds, nurture them with harmony, and maintain them with balance. They delight in the Dao and forget lowliness, embody virtue and forget poverty. If their nature has no desires, there is nothing they desire that they do not attain. This speaks of guarding emptiness and holding fast to the nature of non-desire, so there is nothing they desire that they do not attain. If their hearts have no joy, there is no joy they do not manifest. This speaks of their minds being upright, not delighting in perverse pleasures, so there is no proper joy they do not embrace. This speaks of all joys being realized.

What does not benefit the emotions is not used to burden virtue, and what is convenient for nature is not used to disturb harmony. Thus, they let their bodies roam freely and their intentions follow their desires, so their regulations and systems can serve as models for the world. *Zong* means to release; *si* means to relax. *Yi* means model.

Now consider the Confucians: they do not trace the root of desire yet forbid what is desired. The root of desire refers to the correct nature of tranquility and indifference. What is desired refers to the emotions and desires for arrogance, luxury, power, and influence. They do not investigate the root of joy yet block what brings joy. This is like unsealing the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers yet trying to dam them with one’s hands. *Zhang* means to block, speaking of the impossibility of covering them.

Those who govern the people are like herders of birds and beasts: if they do not seal off the hunting parks and enclosures, allowing wild ambitions to arise, and instead bind their feet to restrict their movement, how can they hope to cultivate life and attain longevity? Consider Yan Hui, Ji Lu, Zixia, and Ran Boniu—all were Confucius’ most accomplished disciples. Yet Yan Yuan died young, and Ji Lu was minced in Wei. Yan Yuan passed at thirty-eight, and Confucius lamented, "Hui’s untimely death was a misfortune." Thus, it is called an early death. Ji Lu served in Wei, where the ruler and his son contended for the state; Ji Lu perished, and Confucius said, "It seems You did not meet a natural end." This means he did not die of old age, hence the lament. The people of Wei pickled him into sauce, thus it is called *mincing*. Zixia lost his sight, and Ran Boniu contracted a loathsome disease. Zixia studied by the Western River; when his son died, he wept until he went blind, and Zengzi mourned for him. When Boniu fell ill, Confucius reached through the window to grasp his hand, saying, "Such a man, yet afflicted with such a disease!" All these resulted from forcing their nature and suppressing their emotions, failing to achieve harmony.

Thus, when Zixia met Zengzi, one was emaciated and the other plump. Zengzi asked the reason, and Zixia replied, "Upon going out, I saw the pleasures of wealth and nobility and desired them; upon returning, I beheld the Dao of the former kings and rejoiced in it. The two contended in my heart, hence my emaciation." When the Dao of the former kings prevailed, he grew plump. The Dao’s triumph meant he was no longer swayed by wealth and nobility, his spirit turned inward, and without anxious thoughts, he grew plump. Extending this resolve—this being Zixia’s resolve—he was not truly covetous of noble rank or indulgent in extravagant pleasures. He merely ought to have constrained his nature and restrained his desires, using righteousness as his defense. *Ought* here means *only*. Though his emotions were stifled and his form and nature exhausted, he still forced himself to endure, yet could not fulfill his natural lifespan. Using righteousness as a defense, his emotions became pent-up and stagnant, his form and nature worn out. Unable to cease, he compelled himself, thus none could complete their Heaven-appointed years.

As for the perfected person, they eat according to their stomach’s measure, dress according to their body’s needs, roam where they find shelter, and act as their emotions incline. They relinquish the world without greed and abandon all things without seeking profit. *Relinquish* means to discard, not treating all things as advantageous. They dwell in the vast expanse of the universe, wander the boundless wilds—*expanse* meaning emptiness, *boundless* meaning limitless. They ascend the Great Sovereign, rely upon the Great Unity, and hold heaven and earth in their grasp. The *Great Sovereign* is Heaven; *rely* means to depend upon; the *Great Unity* is the form and spirit of Heaven; *hold* means to embrace. How could they be concerned with poverty or wealth, plumpness or emaciation?

Thus, the Confucians cannot prevent people from desiring, but can only restrain them—meaning they cannot eliminate human emotions and desires, yet though they themselves may desire, they can use righteousness to restrain themselves. They cannot prevent people from finding joy, but can only forbid it—meaning they cannot stop people from delighting in wealth and nobility, yet can use ritual to restrain themselves. As the *Analects* says, "Wealth and nobility obtained through unrighteousness are to me like floating clouds." Is making the world fear punishment and dare not steal truly better than eliminating the very thought of theft? The people of Yue prized bearded serpents as the finest delicacy, while those of the Central States discarded them as useless. *Bearded serpents* are giant snakes, several *zhang* in length, which the Yue considered a supreme dish. Knowing their uselessness, even the greedy can refuse them; not knowing their uselessness, even the incorruptible cannot decline.

Now, the reason rulers bring ruin to their states, abandon their altars of soil and grain, die at the hands of others, and become a laughingstock to the world is never unrelated to their perverse desires. The lord of Chou You coveted the great bells’ bribe and lost his state. Chou You was a Di state near Jin. When Jin’s Viscount Zhi Xiang attacked, he first offered a great bell as a bribe. The lord of Chou You, greedy, opened the road to receive the bell, seeking peace. Viscount Zhi then used this pretext to invade and annihilate the state. *Chou* is read as *chou yu*. The lord of Yu desired the jade of Chui Ji and was captured. When Jin’s minister Xun Xi plotted with Duke Xian, he used the horses of Qu Chan and the jade of Chui Ji to borrow passage through Yu to attack Guo. The lord of Yu, coveting the jade and horses, granted Jin passage. After destroying Guo, Jin turned back to lodge in Yu and then attacked, annihilating it. When a ruler dies and his position is lost, it is called *annihilation*, hence it is said he was *captured*. Duke Xian was infatuated with Li Ji’s beauty and threw four generations into chaos. When Duke Xian of Jin attacked the Li Rong, he obtained Li Ji and her younger sister. *Infatuated* refers to her beauty of form; *enamored* refers to her beauty of appearance. Duke Xian favored her, and she bore Xi Qi; her sister bore Zhuo Zi. He then killed the crown prince Shen Sheng and enthroned Xi Qi. Killing the legitimate heir to establish a concubine’s son is called *chaos*. The four generations were Xi Qi, Zhuo Zi, Duke Hui (Yi Wu), and Duke Huai (Yu). Duke Huan savored Yi Ya’s delicacies and failed to bury him in a timely manner. Duke Huan of Qi loved fine flavors; Yi Ya steamed his eldest son and presented him, thus gaining trust and monopolizing state power, sowing discord between the legitimate heir and concubine’s sons. When Duke Huan died, his five sons contended for the throne; his corpse lay in state for sixty days, maggots crawling from the door, and he was not buried for five months, hence it is said he was *not buried in a timely manner*. The king of Hu indulged in women and music’s pleasures and lost his finest lands. Hu was likely a ruler of the Western Rong. When Duke Mu of Qin wished to attack, he first sent female musicians to corrupt his resolve. His minister You Yu remonstrated, but he did not heed, so You Yu left the Rong and went to Qin. Qin then attacked and seized his finest lands. *Finest lands* means fertile territory.

Had these five rulers—of Chou You, Yu, Jin, Qi, and Hu—moderated their emotions, declined excess, taken themselves as the measure, and not been swayed by external things, how could they have suffered such great disasters? The five rulers are those of Chou You, Yu, Duke Xian of Jin, Duke Huan of Qi, and the king of Hu. *Moderated* means *restrained*.

Movement is like delusion. Thus, an archer does not hit the mark without arrows, yet one who learns archery does not craft arrows—meaning one obtains their use without making them. Yet those who craft them do not obtain their use.

A charioteer does not drive without reins, yet one who learns charioteering does not make reins. If one knows that a fan is useless in winter and fur robes are useless in summer, then the myriad transformations of things become mere dust.

Thus, pouring water to stop boiling only fails to halt it; if one truly knows the root, one need only remove the fire. *箑* means *fan*. The people of Chu call a fan *箑*. *已* means *to cease*.

*Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll Twelve ends.
*Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll Thirteen.

The Grand Commandant and Libationer, your servant Xu Shen, respectfully records:

This *Benjing Xun* begins with *ben* (root). *Jing* means constancy. The constant transformations of Heaven emerge from the Dao/Way, and the causes of order and chaos, of gain and loss, are ever-fixed. Thus it is called *Benjing* (Root and Constancy), and the title of the scroll follows accordingly.

The inception of the Great Clarity (*Taiqing*) is harmony and compliance, serene and still. *Qing* means tranquility. *Taiqing* is the beginning of non-action. It refers to the era of the Three Sovereigns, when harmony and compliance prevailed, neither opposing Heaven nor harming creatures. *Jimo* (serene and still) means not disturbing the people. Their nature was true and unadorned, their essence pure and undispersed. They were leisurely and quiet, free from restlessness. *Zhi* means nature; *zhen* means unchanging; *supo* (unadorned simplicity) means essence undispersed. *Xianjing* (leisurely and quiet) means desireless. Without disturbance, they remained constant.

Internally, they aligned with the Dao/Way; externally, they harmonized with righteousness. *Internally* refers to the will residing in the heart. By moderating desires, they could align with the Dao/Way. *Externally* refers to the conduct they practiced. Their actions did not transgress rules and norms, thus they could harmonize with righteousness. (Righteousness may also be rendered as virtue/power.) Their actions manifested in refinement, their conduct swift and beneficial to all things. *Fa* (manifest) means to initiate; *dong* (act) means to move. *Wen* means refinement; *bian* (beneficial) means advantage; *wu* (things) means affairs.

Their words were concise yet followed principle; their conduct was joyful yet accorded with human feelings. *Lüe* (concise) means essential and succinct. *Tuo* (joyful) means simple and easy. *Tuo* is read as in *she tuo* (unnoticed swiftness in archery). Their hearts were joyful yet without deceit; their affairs were plain yet without adornment. *Yu* (joyful) means harmony; *wei* (deceit) means falsehood and cunning. *Su* (plain) means unadorned; *shi* (adornment) means artifice.

Thus, they did not select auspicious days or divine through hexagrams and omens. *Ze* (select) means to choose; *gua* (hexagrams) refers to the eight trigrams; *zhao* (omens) refers to the cracks in tortoise shells. These were the means by which the world divined fortune and misfortune. They did not scheme over beginnings or debate endings. When at ease, they rested; when pressed, they acted. Their entire being merged with Heaven and Earth, their essence aligned with yin and yang. They harmonized with the four seasons. *Yi* (harmonized) means united. They shone brightly like the sun and moon, and vied with the creators in balance. *Zaohua* (creators) refers to Heaven and Earth; *cixiong* (balance) means harmony and accord.

Thus, Heaven covered all with virtue/power, Earth bore all with joy. *Le* (joy) means life. The four seasons did not err in their sequence; wind and rain did not descend with cruelty. The sun and moon were pure and radiant. *Guang* (radiant) means brightness. The five planets followed their paths without deviating from their courses. The five planets are Mars, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury. *Gui* (paths) means courses; *xun* (followed) means compliance.

In this era, the mysterious origin reached its vastness and radiated illumination. *Xuan* means Heaven; *yuan* means qi. *Dang* (vastness) means greatness. It speaks of a ruler of utmost virtue/power, whose benevolence and kindness were boundless, illuminating all within the four seas. Phoenixes and unicorns arrived; milfoil and tortoise shells divined. Phoenixes and unicorns appeared at the gates of an era of sagely virtue/power. *Shi* (milfoil) refers to the forty-nine stalks; *zhao* (divination) means trust. They spoke truly of good and ill fortune. Sweet dew descended; bamboo bore fruit in abundance; flowing yellow emerged; and vermilion grass grew. *Man* (abundance) means fulfillment. *Liuhuang* (flowing yellow) refers to jade. The growth of vermilion grass in courtyards—all were auspicious signs.

Cunning devices and deceit did not lodge in their hearts. *Mo* means without. By the time of the degenerate age, mountains were quarried for stone, and metals and jades were sought. *Juan* (quarried) means chiseled, to seek gold and jade. Gold and jade were carved into vessels; clams and oysters were pried open. *Qie* (carved) means to engrave; *ti* (pried) means to open, to seek pearls. Copper and iron were smelted, yet the myriad things did not flourish. They did not grow, meaning all things were exhausted.

Fetuses were destroyed, and the young were killed. Unicorns did not roam. *Tai* (fetuses) refers to animal embryos; *yao* (young) refers to fawns. As their kind were harmed, they did not come to roam. Nests were overturned, and eggs were shattered. Phoenixes did not soar. Eggs refer to those not yet hatched. Fire was drilled from wood; towers were constructed from timber. Forests were burned for the hunt; marshes were drained for fishing. *Tian* (hunt) means to chase game; *jie ze* (drained marshes) means to empty pools.

Tools were insufficient, yet stored goods were in surplus. *Xie* (tools) refers to implements; *xu zang* (stored goods) means accumulated reserves filling storehouses. Yet the myriad things did not multiply in signs. Sprouts, buds, eggs, and embryos failed to mature—more than half perished.

Earth was piled into mounds for dwelling; fields were manured to grow grain. Wells were dug for drinking; rivers were dredged for benefit. *Shu* (dredged) means cleared. Walls were built for defense; beasts were captured for domestication. Then yin and yang became disordered, the four seasons lost their sequence. Thunder and lightning wrought destruction; hail and sleet descended cruelly. Mists, snow, and frost did not clear. *Ji* (clear) means to cease. And the myriad things withered and died. The harm of frost and snow unceasing, the myriad things withered and failed to flourish.

Thorns and brambles overgrew; weeds and brush filled the fields. *Zi* (thorns) refers to dense grass; *zhen* (brambles) refers to clustered trees, heaped in the fields. Wild grasses were cut down; seedlings and grain stalks grew. *Shan* (cut) means to kill; *tan* (wild grasses) refers to weeds; *miao* (seedlings) refers to crops. They did not bloom yet bore fruit—this is called *xiu* (fruiting without flowering). The sprouting, flowering, and fruiting of grasses and trees, only to die—these were beyond counting.

Then came vast halls and towering palaces, linked chambers and aligned pillars. *Xiawu* (vast halls) means great houses; *xianlian* (linked chambers) refers to connected eaves where sparrows nested. Another says it means ornamental belts. *Fang* (chambers) means rooms; *zhi* (pillars) refers to doorposts. Eaves and beams, rafters and ridgepoles—*lao* (eaves) refers to the eaves beams; *yan* (beams) refers to the overhanging roof; *cui* (rafters) refers to the ridgepoles; *ti* (ridgepoles) means aligned.

Carved and chiseled, towering branches and winding eaves, lotus and water chestnut, coiling roofs and curved halls—*furong* (lotus) refers to the flower of the lotus root; *lingjiao* (water chestnut) refers to the horned water caltrop; *he* (water lily) refers to the lotus. Five colors vied in splendor, flowing and mingling in dazzling beauty. *Liuman* (flowing) means colors intermingling; *luli* (dazzling) means splendid in appearance. Curved and twisted beams, supple and bending rafters, sharp and tangled, dense and intertwined—all were adornments of the halls. *Mang* (sharp) is read as in *mai mang* (wheat awn); *na* (tangled) is read as in *Ruxian* of Shanggu.

The timbers interlock and support one another, yet even the craft of Gongshu or Wang Er—with no need for their adzes, *ji* knives, or saws—could not suffice for the desires of rulers. Gongshu was a master artisan; one account calls him the sobriquet of Lu Ban. Wang Er was an ancient master craftsman. *Pou* (剖) refers to the skillful carving of black-bordered patterns to their edges. *Ji* () is the carpenter’s square. *Xue* (削) is a double-edged hooked knife. *Pou* is pronounced like *zhi* in *zhi chi* (measuring rod); *ji* like *jue* in *jue jiao* (stumbling); *xue* like *xiao* in *xiao tou* (silk headband). Yet even so, they could not satisfy the ruler’s desires.

Thus, pine and cypress withered in summer, their roots robust yet their foliage scorched; bamboo shoots and fungal growths sprouted in winter—these were woods hardy against the cold, yet at that time, even they perished in the summer drought. This was because the ruler’s actions defied the seasons, disrupting the harmony of yin and yang. *Jun* (菌) is pronounced like *lun* (纶); *lu* (露) like *lu* in the southern Yang dialect for "road." The Jiang, the He, and the Three Rivers ran dry and ceased to flow—the Jing, the Wei, and the Qian, all rising from Mount Qi. *Jue* (绝) means exhausted; hence, "ceased to flow." As the *Guoyu* states: "How could the Shang perish if not for exhaustion?" The *yiyang* beast grazed in the fields—the *yiyang* was a earth spirit. When the Yin was on the verge of collapse, it appeared in the outskirts of Shang, in the pastures of Muye. Flying insects filled the wilds—*qiong* (蛩), cicadas, and midges, or in another account, locusts. In Yanzhou, they were called *teng*. *Teng* is pronounced near *dai*, with a drawn-out breath. *Qiong* is pronounced like *gong* in *shou gong* (受拱). The land cracked from drought, *che* (坼) meaning parched and split. The phoenix did not descend, and beasts with hooked claws, bared fangs, crested horns, and spurred talons grew fierce—*gou zhao* (句爪) referred to eagles and hawks; *ju ya* (居牙) to bears and tigers. *Ju* (距) is pronounced like *ju* in *ju shou* (拒守).

The people dwelled in thatched huts and hovels, with nowhere to seek shelter—*zhuan* (专) meant small, solitary dwellings; *peng lu* (蓬庐) were shelters of woven reeds. If guests arrived, there was no refuge to offer. Those who froze or starved, who perished from hunger or cold, lay piled like mattresses—so numerous were they. Only when mountains and valleys were divided into territories, when populations were tallied and apportioned, when walls were raised and moats dug, when traps and fortifications were set as defenses, when offices were adorned and ranks established—*deng* (等) meaning distinctions—when noble and base were differentiated, worthy and unworthy distinguished, when records of praise and blame were kept, when rewards and punishments were meted out—*jing* (经) meaning inscribed, *fei* (诽) for condemnation, *yu* (誉) for acclaim—only then did arms rise and strife arise. The people were crushed and oppressed, their nature obscured; the innocent were slaughtered, and the blameless executed—such was the world that emerged.

*Yi* (抑) means servitude; the people suffered the agony of annihilation and premature death. The union of Heaven and Earth, the molding of the myriad things by yin and yang—all depend on the qi of humanity. When Heaven and Earth harmonize their qi, yin and yang arise, shaping the ten thousand things. Thus, when ruler and minister grow estranged, qi ascends in steam—*li* (离) means discord. When lord and subject are at odds, the five grains fail to grow. From the winter solstice to the forty-sixth day thereafter, Heaven holds its harmony but does not yet descend; it harbors qi but does not yet release it. From the onset of winter to the solstice, all remains inert. Yin and yang gather and linger, breathing in slow, deep currents, enveloping customs and mores—*chu yu* (储与) means lingering, as in *shang yang* (尚羊), a state of suspended generation. Another account calls it vast and expansive. *Jin tan* (浸潭) means broad and overflowing; hence, "enveloping customs and mores." Measuring the myriad differences, balancing the needs of all—*pang* (旁) means alongside; *bo* (薄) means near. All things find their proper place. Through mutual exchange and fermentation, they nurture the multitude of life. *Fu* (咐) is pronounced like *fu* in *fu ming* (符命); *yun niang* (酝酿) means harmonious blending.

Thus, spring’s solemnity and autumn’s flourishing, winter’s thunder and summer’s frost—all arise from perverse qi. From this perspective, Heaven and Earth, the cosmos, are as one body—an analogy drawn from the self. The six directions—all within the realm of a single person’s control. The six directions are the four quarters, above and below. Therefore, one who understands nature cannot be coerced by Heaven and Earth—*xie* (胁) means intimidation. One who discerns signs cannot be deluded by strange phenomena—*shen* (审) means clarity; *fu* (符) means verification. Strange phenomena are the abnormal, which bewilder people.

Thus, the sage infers the distant from the near, unifying the myriad differences—*shu* (殊) means divergence; *yi* (一) means unity. The ancients harmonized their qi with Heaven and Earth, moving in ease with their age. *You you* (优游) means yielding and following. In that time, there was no profit in celebration, no awe in punishment—*wei* (威) originally written as *gan* (感)—no rites, no duty, no integrity, no shame; no praise or blame for benevolence or baseness. Yet the people did not encroach upon or deceive one another, nor did they commit violence—all remained within the great obscurity. *Hun* (混) means vast; the vast obscurity refers to the Dao.

When the age declined, people multiplied while resources dwindled; toil increased, yet sustenance was insufficient. Thus, resentment and strife arose, and benevolence was prized. Yet benevolence and baseness were unequal; cliques and factions formed, deceit and cunning flourished, hearts filled with artifice and guile—and human nature was lost. *Xu* (谞) means scheming; *xing shi* (性失) means the loss of pure, unadulterated nature. Thus, righteousness was prized. The passions of yin and yang, all beings endowed with blood and qi, men and women dwelling together without distinction—thus, rites were prized. Rites serve to differentiate. The impulses of life and destiny, when excessive and coercive—*xie* (胁) means compulsion—when driven by necessity, lead to disharmony. Thus, music was prized, for music brings harmony.

Therefore, benevolence, righteousness, rites, and music can remedy decline, but they are not the ultimate path to universal governance. Benevolence remedies strife; righteousness remedies loss; rites remedy excess; music remedies sorrow. When the numinous clarity is established throughout the world, and the heart returns to its origin—when the heart returns to its origin, the people’s nature becomes good. The origin is the beginning, the state of pure emotion.

Before desires arise, thus is nature good. When the people’s nature is good, and heaven and earth, yin and yang, envelop them, then resources suffice and people abound—greed, baseness, wrath, and strife cannot arise. From this perspective, benevolence and righteousness are no longer needed.

When the Dao and its virtue are established throughout the world and the people remain pure and simple, the eye does not covet beauty—*ying* (营) means infatuation—the ear is not seduced by sound. They sit idly singing folk songs, hair unbound wandering freely. Though Mao Qiang and Xi Shi’s beauty be before them, they know no delight, for they esteem virtue. The dances of *Diaoyu* and *Wuxiang*—*Diaoyu* being the feather dance, *Wuxiang* the music of King Wu of Zhou—they know no joy. Wantonness and excess, with no distinction, cannot arise. From this perspective, rites and music are no longer needed.

Thus, when virtue declines, benevolence arises; when conduct falters, righteousness is established—*ju* (沮) means ruin. When harmony is lost, tones and tunes emerge; when rites become excessive, adornments follow. Therefore, only when one knows the numinous clarity does one realize the insufficiency of the Dao and its virtue. Only when one knows the Dao and its virtue does one realize the insufficiency of benevolence and righteousness—the Dao and its virtue are the root, benevolence and righteousness the branches. Only when one knows benevolence and righteousness does one realize the insufficiency of rites and music—benevolence and righteousness are great, rites and music small.

Now, to turn from the root and seek the branches, to abandon the essential and pursue the elaborate—this is no way to speak of the ultimate. The ultimate is the Way of supreme virtue.

The vastness of heaven and earth can be measured by the carpenter’s square and gnomon—*ju* (矩) means measure, *biao* (表) the shadow staff, *shi* (识) knowledge. The movements of stars and moon can be calculated by calendrical arts—*li* (历) means method, *tui* (推) to deduce. The sound of thunder can be imitated by drums and bells—*xie* (写) means to replicate or teach. The changes of wind and rain can be known through musical tuning, for tuning discerns yin and yang.

Thus, what is vast and visible can be measured; what is bright and apparent can be obscured—*bi* (蔽) may also mean observed. What is audible can be harmonized; what is perceptible in color can be distinguished. Yet the supremely great, heaven and earth cannot contain; the supremely subtle, the numinous clarity cannot govern—*ling* (领) means to order.

When one establishes calendrical arts, distinguishes the five colors, and separates the pure from the turbid—*qingshang* being the pure, *zhuogong* the turbid—when one discriminates sweet and bitter tastes, then simplicity scatters and becomes vessels. When one institutes benevolence and righteousness, cultivates rites and music, then virtue shifts and becomes artifice—*xiu* (修) means to establish, *qian* (迁) to transform.

Once artifice arises, cunning is adorned to startle the foolish, deceit is devised to deceive superiors. In the world, some can uphold this, some can govern it. Those who uphold it are the people of Jie and Zhou; those who govern it are the lords Tang and Wu.

Of old, Cang Jie created writing, and heaven rained grain while ghosts wept at night. Cang Jie first observed the patterns of birds’ tracks and devised written contracts—thus deception and falsehood sprouted. When deception and falsehood sprout, one turns from the root to the branches, abandons the work of plowing and weaving, and pursues the profit of needle and knife. Heaven, knowing they would starve, thus rained grain. Ghosts, fearing they would be imitated by written words, wept at night—*gui* (鬼) may also be *tu* (兔), the hare, fearing its fur would be taken for brushes, harming its body, thus wept at night.

Bo Yi dug the first well, and dragons ascended dark clouds while spirits dwelled on Kunlun. Bo Yi, assisting Shun, first dug wells to seek water. Dragons, knowing rivers and valleys would be drained, ponds and reservoirs breached, feared harm and thus ascended clouds, their spirits dwelling on Kunlun’s mountain.

The more abilities increase, the thinner virtue grows. *Yu* (愈) means to increase.

Thus, the Zhou tripods depicted Chui with his fingers in his mouth, to demonstrate that great craft cannot be forced. Chui was the master artisan of Yao. When the Zhou cast the tripods, they engraved Chui’s likeness upon them, his fingers held in his mouth. Had Chui lived to see it, his skill could not have surpassed it—he could only bite his fingers in awe. Hence it is said: this clarifies that craft cannot be forced.

Another account holds that the Zhou, in casting the tripods, carved Chui’s form upon them, making him bite his own fingers as a warning to later ages, showing that one ought not force great craft.

Therefore, the governance of the perfected person is such that the heart abides with spirit, form harmonizes with nature, stillness embodies virtue, and motion accords with principle. Following the natural disposition and adhering to inevitable transformations, one acts with effortless clarity, and the world harmonizes of itself. With serene desirelessness, the people return to simplicity. Without omens or portents, the people do not die young. Without strife or contention, nurturance suffices. Embracing all within the seas, beneficence extends to later generations—yet none know who it is that effects this.

The Dao has no name; it is simply so of itself. Hence it is said: none know who it is.

Thus, in life there is no title, in death no posthumous name. Substance does not accumulate, and names are not established. *Substance* here means wealth. The Dao is not named, so names are not established.

The giver does not claim virtue, the receiver does not decline. The giver does not regard it as a favor but merely aids the needy. The receiver does not refuse but accepts without embellished modesty. Virtue and exchange return to it, yet none can bear to withhold it. *Bear* here means *not bear*.

Therefore, where virtue is unified, the Dao cannot harm it. *Unified* means *as one*. Where wisdom does not reach, eloquence cannot resolve it. Even the most cunning cannot know it; how could mere words untangle it?

The eloquence of silence, the Dao of non-discourse—should one penetrate these, it is called the Celestial Treasury. *Penetrate* means *to attain*. One who attains the eloquence of silence and the Dao of non-discourse enters the treasury of Heaven.

Draw from it without depletion; *depletion* means *diminishment*. Bestow from it without exhaustion; *bestow* means *to give*, and *exhaustion* means *to deplete*. None know whence it arises—this is called *Yaoguang*.

*Yaoguang* is that which provisions the myriad things. *Yaoguang* refers to the seventh star of the Northern Dipper’s handle. Abiding at the center, it revolves, pointing through the twelve celestial branches, stirring yin and yang to give life and death to the myriad things.

Another account holds that *Yaoguang* is the manifestation of harmonious qi. When it relieves the destitute and supplements the deficient, a name arises—*name* here means *benevolent renown*. When it promotes benefit, removes harm, punishes disorder, and restrains violence, success is achieved—*success* here means *martial achievement*.

In an age without calamity, even spirits have no virtue to bestow. When above and below are in harmony, even the worthy have no merit to establish.

In the age of Rongcheng, roads were walked in ordered ranks—Rongcheng was the one who devised the calendar under the Yellow Emperor. *Ordered ranks* means elders and juniors kept their proper places. Infants were entrusted to nests above, surplus grain was stored at the ends of eaves, tigers and leopards could be tailed, and vipers and serpents could be trodden underfoot, yet none knew the reason for such harmony. Tigers and leopards, though fierce, harbored no intent to harm, so their tails could be grasped. Vipers and serpents bore no venom, so they could be trampled. People of that time took it as natural, saying they knew not why it was so.

By the time of Yao, ten suns rose together, scorching the crops, withering the grasses and trees, leaving the people with nothing to eat. *Yaoyu*, *Zaochi*, *Jiuying*, *Dafeng*, *Fengxi*, and *Xiusheshe* all wrought havoc upon the people. *Ya* is pronounced like the *zha* in *zha lü ren* (crushing a man under a cart). *Yu* is the *yu* in *ji chu yu* (swiftly cured). Yao then sent Yi to slay *Zaochi* in the wilds of Chouhua—*Zaochi* was a beast with teeth three feet long, shaped like a chisel, extending below its jaw while wielding spear and shield. Yi, skilled in archery, was sent by Yao to shoot and kill it. Chouhua was a marsh in the south. He slew *Jiuying* by the banks of the Xiongshui—*Jiuying* was a monster of water and fire that harmed people. The land of the northern Di had the Xiongshui. He shot down *Dafeng* at the marsh of Qingqiu—*Dafeng* was the Earl of Wind, capable of destroying homes. Yi intercepted it at Qingqiu’s marsh to prevent its harm. Another account says he shot it down with a feathered arrow. Qingqiu was a marsh in the east. Above, he shot the ten suns, and below, he killed *Yaoyu*—with ten suns rising together, Yi shot down nine. *Yaoyu* was a beast resembling a dragon’s head. Some say it was like a leopard, swift and man-eating, dwelling in the west. He severed *Xiusheshe* at Dongting and captured *Fengxi* at Sanglin—*Xiusheshe* was a great serpent that could swallow an elephant and disgorge its bones after three years. Dongting was a marsh in the south. *Fengxi* was a giant boar—the people of Chu called boars *xi*. Sanglin was the mulberry grove where Tang prayed for rain. The people rejoiced and set Yao upon the throne as Son of Heaven. From this time, the world’s vast distances, hazards, and remotenesses first had measured roads.

Then in the time of Shun, Gonggong stirred the surging floodwaters to press against Kongsang—Gonggong was the name of the water official, a descendant of Bohou. *Stirred* means set in motion; *surging* means overflowing. He sought to dam and block the hundred rivers, raising the high and lowering the low to harm the world. *Pressed* means forced. Kongsang was a place in Lu. The Dragon Gate remained unopened, Lüliang unbreached, the Yangtze and Huai flowed as one, and the four seas merged into a vast expanse, so the people climbed hills and fled to trees. The Dragon Gate was a narrow pass of the Yellow River, located north of Xiayang in Zuo Fengyi, carved by Yu. Lüliang was in Lü County of Pengcheng, where rocks rose from the water; Yu dredged it to allow passage, so it was called Lüliang. Before it was breached, waterways were blocked, the Yangtze and Huai merged, and the four seas became a boundless marsh. Shun then sent Yu to dredge the Three Rivers and Five Lakes, split Yique, and guide the Chan and Jian—Yique was a mountain name. Yu opened it to channel the Yi River, so it was called *split*. Yique lay ninety *li* southwest of Luoyang. Chan and Jian were two rivers. *Chan* is pronounced like the *chan* in *guo chan* (wrapping and binding). He leveled the ditches and fields, directing the flow into the Eastern Sea. The Great Flood receded, the Nine Provinces dried, and the people all settled into their natures. Thus Yao and Shun were hailed as sages.

In later ages, emperors like Jie and Zhou built *xuan* halls, *yao* terraces, ivory galleries, and jade beds—*xuan* and *yao* were stones resembling jade, used to adorn halls and terraces. Ivory was used to decorate galleries, and jade to make beds. This spoke of their excessive labor. *Xuan* is sometimes written as *xuan* (revolving), *yao* as *yao* (shaking), meaning the halls had mechanisms to turn, and the terraces could be shaken, showcasing the utmost craftsmanship in earth and timber. Zhou created meat gardens and wine pools—Zhou amassed meat into gardens and wine into pools. Today, Chaoge in Henei was Zhou’s capital. West of the city lies a mound of dregs, the site of the wine pool. He burned and squandered the world’s wealth, exhausted the people’s strength, disemboweled remonstrators, and ripped open pregnant women. Prince Bi Gan, Zhou’s uncle, repeatedly admonished Zhou’s tyranny, so Zhou split his heart to examine it—hence *disemboweled remonstrators*. *Pregnant women* refers to those about to give birth. Zhou cut them open to observe their wombs—hence *ripped open pregnant women*. He plundered the world and oppressed the people. Thus Tang led three hundred war chariots to attack Jie at Nanchao, exiling him to the Summer Terrace—*war chariots* were military vehicles. Nanchao is today’s Chaoxian in Lujiang. The Summer Terrace was a great terrace, originally a palace. King Wu, with three thousand armored soldiers, defeated Zhou at Muye and killed him in the Xuan Hall—King Wu was King Wen’s son, Fa. Those in chariots were called *shi*; those on foot, *zu*. Muye was a place in the southern suburbs, outside Chaoge’s city. The Xuan Hall was a palace of Yin. Another account says it was a prison. The world was pacified, and the people lived in harmony. Thus Tang and Wu were praised as worthy.

From this we see that those with the names of sages and worthies must encounter the perils of troubled times. Now, when perfected ones are born into such ages, harboring virtue and embracing the Dao, restraining their boundless wisdom, clamping their mouths shut and ceasing speech, many die without uttering a word. *Perfected ones* are those of utmost virtue. Yet the world knows not the value of their silence. None esteem those who die with sealed lips. Thus, *the Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao*.

The utmost Dao has no name and cannot be spoken—thus it is said, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao." The name that can be named is not the enduring name. The name of the *zhenren* cannot be named. What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and transmitted to others is but its coarse form.

The Five Emperors and Three Kings pursued different affairs yet shared the same aim, followed different paths yet reached the same destination. The Five Emperors were the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao, and Emperor Shun. The Three Kings were Yu of Xia, Tang of Yin, and King Wen of Zhou. "Same destination" means they all cultivated benevolence and righteousness.

Scholars of later ages, not understanding the unity of the Dao or the essentials of virtue—*zong* meaning "all," *yao* meaning "to summarize"—cling to the traces of past achievements. They sit solemnly together discoursing on them, singing and dancing in celebration. Thus, though they amass broad learning and much knowledge, they remain mired in confusion.

As the *Odes* says:
*"Dare not wrestle tigers bare-handed,
Dare not ford rivers without boats—
People know this one thing,
But know not the rest."*
This is what it means.

To wrestle tigers without weapons is called *baohu*; to cross rivers without boats or oars is called *pinghe*. To govern while acting as a petty man is to court peril if one is not reverent—for recklessness invites ruin, just as *baohu* and *pinghe* lead inevitably to death. People see only the immediate harm in *baohu* and *pinghe*, yet fail to recognize the need for caution against the perils of petty men. Thus it is said, "They know this one thing, but know not the rest." This is what it means to remain mired in confusion.

Those who embody the *Emperor* model themselves on the *Taiyi*; *ti* means "to emulate." The *Taiyi* is the punitive spirit of Heaven. Those who embody the *King* follow the patterns of yin and yang. Those who embody the *Hegemon* align with the four seasons. Those who embody the *Ruler* employ the six pitch-pipes.

Those who grasp the *Taiyi* encompass Heaven and Earth, press down upon mountains and rivers—*lao* is read as *liu* (to flow), as the people of Chu call "encompassing" *liu*. To "press down" upon mountains and rivers is to command clouds and rain, then restrain them. They inhale and exhale yin and yang, extend and draw in the four seasons—*shenye* meaning to guide and harmonize them. They order the eight directions, weave the warp and weft of the six directions, bestow their covering dew and illuminating guidance universally, without partiality—*pu* meaning "great," *si* meaning "multitude." Without private loves or hates, they act with impartiality. All that flies and wriggles looks up to their virtue to live.

Yin and yang uphold the harmony of Heaven and Earth, shaping the myriad forms, containing qi to transform things and complete their kinds—*lie* meaning "form." They expand and contract, coil and unfurl, sinking into the unfathomable—*ying* meaning "to extend," *suo* meaning "to shrink," *juan* meaning "to coil," *shu* meaning "to unfurl." *Lun* means "to enter," *ce* means "depth," entering the immeasurable depths. They cycle through emptiness and fullness, revolving without origin, returning to the boundless source.

The four seasons—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—take from what is timely, proceed and retreat in due season, open and close, expand and contract, never losing their order—*xi* is read as *xie* (to contract), *xu* meaning "sequence." Joy and anger, firmness and softness never depart from their principle. *Li* means "Dao."

The six pitch-pipes govern life and death, reward and punishment, bestowal and seizure—*zi* meaning "to bestow," *duo* meaning "to take away." Without these, there is no Dao. Thus, the ruler who employs the four seasons and six pitch-pipes uses nothing beyond these principles.

Therefore, by carefully attending to the balance of the steelyard, the level of the water, and the straightness of the marking line, and by discerning weight and lightness, one suffices to govern within one’s borders. *Quanheng* means "balance," *zhun* means "standard," *sheng* means "straight."

Thus, those who embody the *Taiyi* understand the nature of Heaven and Earth, penetrate the principles of the Dao and virtue, shine with a brilliance surpassing sun and moon, and extend their spirit to all things. Their movement and stillness harmonize with yin and yang, their joy and anger align with the four seasons. Their virtue and grace extend beyond the four seas—*shi* meaning "to reach distant lands." Their fame endures for generations to come.

The transmission of their fame endures through later generations.

Those who model themselves upon yin and yang share virtue with Heaven and Earth—*can* meaning "to align." Their clarity rivals sun and moon—*bing* meaning "to parallel." Their essence merges with spirits and gods—*zong* meaning "to unite."

They bear the round and tread the square, embracing the upright and holding the straight—*yuan* signifying Heaven, *fang* signifying Earth, *biao* meaning "upright," and *sheng* meaning "straight." Within, they govern the self; without, they win the hearts of others. When they issue commands, none under Heaven fail to follow their transformative influence—*feng* meaning "transformation."

Thus, the four seasons are supple yet unbroken, firm yet unyielding—*gui* meaning "to snap." They are generous yet not lax—*si* meaning "slack." Though generous, they do not overstep moderation. They are solemn yet not oppressive—*su* meaning "urgent." Though urgent, they do not rush to disorder.

Gentle and yielding, they nurture all beings—*lei* meaning "all creatures." Their virtue embraces the foolish and accommodates the unworthy, without partiality—*si* meaning "bias."

Those who employ the six pitch-pipes suppress disorder and restrain violence, promote the worthy and demote the unworthy, support the upright—*ba* meaning "to appoint," *fu* meaning "to govern." They level peril to create evenness, straighten crookedness to restore rectitude—*jiao* meaning "to correct," *wang* meaning "bent." They master the principles of prohibition and permission, opening and closing, seizing the moment and leveraging circumstances to subdue and employ the hearts of the people—*yi* meaning "to employ."

Thus, emperors who embody yin and yang invite encroachment, suffering incursions from the Central States. Kings who model themselves upon the four seasons face diminution, enduring encroachments from the Central States—*zhuan* states that feudal lords violate royal authority. Hegemons who regulate the six pitch-pipes suffer humiliation, enduring contempt from neighboring states. Rulers who lose the standard and plumb line are deposed, replaced by worthier ministers.

Therefore, those who act grandly in petty matters overflow without intimacy—*taoyao* meaning "unfilled and loose," failing to win the allegiance of their ministers. Those who act meagerly in great matters become narrow and unaccommodating, their governance constricted and unable to embrace their ministers.

When the noble and base do not transgress their proper stations, all under Heaven is well-ordered. To not transgress their stations is to act grandly in grand matters and meagerly in meager ones.

Heaven cherishes its luminosity—*jing* meaning "brilliance." Earth cherishes its levelness—*ping* meaning "evenness." Humans cherish their nature—*qing* meaning "innate disposition." Heaven’s luminosity resides in the sun, moon, stars, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain. Earth’s levelness resides in water, fire, metal, wood, and soil. Human nature resides in thought, discernment, joy, and anger.

Thus, by sealing the four gates and halting the five escapes, one merges with the Dao—*si guan* referring to the ears, eyes, heart, and mouth; *dun* meaning "to flee"; *lun* meaning "to enter."

Therefore, divine clarity conceals itself in formlessness, and essence returns to utmost authenticity—*zhen* meaning "the self." The eyes see without gazing, the ears hear without listening, the heart flows unimpeded without deliberation. One surrenders without acting, harmonizes without arrogance—*jin* meaning "self-importance." This is the true nature of life and destiny, where cunning and artifice cannot intrude—*za* meaning "to mingle."

When essence flows through the eyes, vision becomes clear. When it resides in the ears, hearing becomes acute. When it lingers in the mouth, speech becomes fitting—*dang* meaning "appropriate." When it gathers in the heart, thought becomes penetrating—*ji* meaning "to settle."

Thus, sealing the four gates ensures the body remains free from affliction, and the hundred joints suffer no ailment—*yuan* meaning "illness," pronounced like *Wan* of Nanyang. Neither death nor life, neither emptiness nor fullness—this is called the *zhenren*, one who preserves constancy.

All disorder arises from dissipation and escape. Dissipation and escape arise from five sources—*liu* meaning "to indulge," *dun* meaning "to flee."

First, the grand construction of palaces and halls—*gou* meaning "to connect," *jia* meaning "timber joined in framework." The erection of lofty towers and elevated walkways—*yanlou* meaning "tall towers," *zhandao* meaning "flying galleries and connecting corridors." The ornate carving of roosts and well-frames—*jiqi jingan* referring to elaborate well enclosures with carved patterns.

Second, the intricate joinery of beams and brackets, mutually supporting one another—*biao* and *bolü* referring to decorative woodwork, *shi qiao* meaning "artful embellishment." The winding carvings and solemn figures—*pan* meaning "coiled dragons," *yu* meaning "curving," *keyan* referring to raised tiger-head ornaments and the like, all palace decorations—*yan* pronounced like the solemnity of *yanran.*

Third, the lavish engravings and intricate inlays—*yinglou* meaning "elaborate patterns," *diao* meaning "carving," *zhuo* referring to jade carving. The deceptive designs and swirling motifs—*guiwen* meaning "eccentric patterns," *huibo* resembling water ripples.

Fourth, the flowing, undulating, and intertwined embellishments—*tangyou* and *yiyu* describing patterns mimicking water’s movement, *ling* meaning "water caltrop," *zhu* meaning "fruit," *shen* meaning "twisted," *bao* meaning "entwined." All depict the interlocking grandeur of decorative motifs—*tang* pronounced like the openness of *chang*, *yi* as in the Yan dialect’s *qiangchun* for *shuo*, *yu* pronounced like the richness of *yu hu wen zai*, *mei* as in the Chu dialect’s *zhu shen*, *bao* pronounced like the prominence of *qi yi.*

Fifth, the chaotic profusion of excessive ornamentation, the tangled web of artifice—*mangfan* meaning "disorderly abundance," *luannuo* meaning "confused entanglement." These clash and compete, all escaping into woodwork.

The excavation of deep pools, the extension of embankments to distant shores—*si* meaning "to extend," *ya* meaning "boundary." The diversion of mountain streams, the adornment of winding banks, the piling of stones in spirals to refine the water’s edge—*shi* meaning "to embellish," *die* meaning "to layer," *chun* meaning "to border." With jade and stone, they adorn the water’s edge, creating refined curves—*xiuqi* referring to the curved banks where water gathers. Some stack stones in spirals along the water’s edge—*xuanshi* meaning "spiraled stones," *die* meaning "to layer," forming *xiuqi.*

They suppress turbulent rapids to stir up surging waves—*yi* meaning "to restrain," *yu* meaning "raging waters," *lao* meaning "torrent." By holding back the rushing currents, they provoke the rise of crashing waves.

The waters curve and twist in winding detours, mimicking the rivers of Yu and Wu—*fu* meaning "to bend," *zhānhuí* meaning "to turn and flow." Yu and Wu were two states abundant in water, encircled by rivers and lakes, so they built winding canals and pools to emulate their meandering courses. *Yu* is pronounced like the first syllable of *yúgàng* ("foolish"); *Wu* refers to Cangwu.

They plant more lotus and water caltrop to feed the turtles and fish—*shù* meaning "to cultivate." The lotus bears roots and seeds; the caltrop is the water chestnut. Both nourish fish and turtles. *Lián* is pronounced like the first syllable of *liányángyú* ("sheepfish lotus").

Swan geese and egrets abound, their rice and grain plentiful in surplus. *Sùshuāng* are birds of the goose family; some say they are a kind of phoenix. Dragon boats with egret-prowed heads float upon the waters, where pipes and reed organs play for amusement—this is the Way of Water in retreat. *Lóngzhōu* are great boats carved with dragon patterns as adornment. *Yì* is a large bird; its image is painted on the prow, hence "egret-prowed." Within the boats, flutes and reed organs play for pleasure, thus "floating music for amusement."

They build towering city walls and erect barriers of peril, raising lofty terraces and pavilions—*shè* meaning "to establish," *shù* meaning "to erect." Another interpretation holds that trees are planted to create natural defenses, making the city difficult to attack and easy to defend. A mound of earth a *zhàng* high is called a *tái*; when wood is added, it becomes a *xiè*. They expand the grandeur of parks and gardens to exhaust the subtlest vistas—*chǐ* meaning "to enlarge." Enclosures with walls are called *yuàn*; those without are *yòu*, used for raising birds and beasts. They pursue the most refined views to their utmost.

The lofty gates rise so high their tops touch the blue clouds; great halls are layered upon one another, rivaling Kunlun in grandeur. The gate towers stand tall and majestic, hence *wèiquè* ("towering gates"). *Dàshà* are great halls; *céng* means "layered"; *jià* refers to the interlocking of timber. Their height rivals that of Mount Kunlun. They construct walls and connecting corridors—*yǒngdào* are elevated walkways and covered bridges. *Yǒng* is pronounced like *yǒngyuè* ("leaping"); *dào* like *dàobù* ("path").

They level the high and augment the low, piling earth to form mountains—*cán* meaning "to collapse," *zēng* meaning "to increase." Paths stretch far, straightening both level and treacherous terrain—*jiē* meaning "swift," *jìng* meaning "to traverse." Dangerous paths are made straight and even. *Yí* means "level." They gallop all day without fear of treading missteps—this is the Way of Earth in retreat.

Great bells and tripods, fine and weighty vessels—*zhōng* is the lord of sounds. *Zhòngqì* are heavy vessels, namely bells and tripods. They carve intricate patterns of birds and insects, intertwining them in elaborate coils—*Shū* states: "mountains, dragons, birds, fire, grain, and white." *Miùzhěn* means "to intertwine and coil." Reclining rhinoceroses and crouching tigers, coiling dragons linked in rows—*sì* is a beast; *qǐnfú* describe their postures. Dragons twist and coil in sequence, their patterns interlocking like woven silk. Their brilliance dazzles and confounds, gleaming with radiant splendor—*cuò* means "intermingled"; *xuàn* means "to bewilder." *Zhàoyào huīhuáng* describes their luminous, lustrous appearance.

Towering and twisted, they curve into elegant patterns. Through carving and chiseling, they inlay with tin and bronze, now dim, now bright—*diāo* means "to carve"; *zhuó* means "to chisel." The inlaid tin can be polished like linked pearls, impossible to separate, hence "now dim, now bright." They suppress flaws and erase blemishes, their frosty patterns sinking deep within, like bamboo or reed mats—this speaks of the beauty of sword patterns, where flaws are erased, and the frosty inlays lie embedded within. *Dān* is a bamboo mat; *qúchú* is a reed mat. Their slanted patterns follow in order, like the inlays of a sword. Woven brocade threads through the excess, dense yet sparse—sword patterns interlock like silk, their threads running through the excess like brocade, appearing dense yet sparse, their brilliance dazzling to the eye. This is the Way of Metal in retreat.

They boil, roast, and burn, blending flavors to perfection, exhausting the sweet and sour variations of Jing and Wu—*Jīng* refers to Chu. These two states excel in balancing sour and salty flavors, pursuing them to their utmost. They burn forests for hunting, setting great trees aflame, pumping bellows to blow embers, melting copper and iron—*gǔ* means "to pump"; *tuó* is the bellows of a furnace. *Duǒ* is the iron pipe at the mouth of the bellows; it is inserted into the fire to blow air, hence "blowing embers." *Xiāo* means "to melt." They refine and forge without end, insatiable in their pursuit—mountains are stripped of their tallest branches, forests of their *zhè* and *zǐ*. *Jùn gàn* are long branches; *zhè* is the mulberry; *zǐ* means "to flourish." They burn wood into charcoal, incinerate grass into ash—*gǎo* is withered grass; *bái* means "white." Above, they obscure the light of heaven; below, they exhaust the wealth of the earth—this is the Way of Fire in retreat. *Tiǎn* means "to deplete." *Zhēn* is read as *diǎn* ("classic").

These five as one are enough to ruin the world. Among these five, even one alone suffices to bring about destruction.

Thus, the ancient system of the *Ming Tang* was designed so that dampness from below could not reach it, mist and dew from above could not penetrate it, and winds from the four directions could not assail it. The *Ming Tang* was the hall where the ruler issued governance. Its structure was round above and square below, with four entrances, each flanked by chambers on the left and right—called *ge*—totaling twelve spaces. Each month, the ruler resided in its chambers to announce the new moon, receive the calendar, and proclaim decrees—hence its name, *Ming Tang*. Within it, ancestral ranks could be ordered, and so it was called the *Grand Temple*. Above it, one could observe auspicious *qi* and record celestial phenomena—thus it was called the *Spirit Terrace*. Its outer form was circular, resembling the *Bi Yong*. The system for feudal lords was half that of the Son of Heaven, and it was called the *Palace*. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"Majestic is the Lord of Lu, at the Pond offering captives."* Earthen works were unadorned, for they were plain. Woodwork was uncarved, for it remained simple.

Carving may also be written as *zhuo*, yet it was not done. This refers to engraving and painting. Metal vessels were not inlaid, nor were they adorned with decorative patterns. *Lou* is read as the *lou* in *loulou*. Garments had no angled or slanted cuts—*yu* means corner, and *chai* means slant. In antiquity, all clothing was made from whole bolts of cloth, without angled or slanted edges. Such edges were trimmed away. Crowns had no *guying* patterns—*guying* refers to designs like linked horse-eye motifs. The absence of such patterns meant that crown ornamentation was merely straight and plain. *Ying* is read as the *ying* in *zhiduan yingwen*. The hall was spacious enough for proper movement and governance—this hall refers to the *Ming Tang*. It was used for ascending, descending, bowing, and yielding to perform ritual postures, hence the term *circuit* (*zhouxuan*). *Liwen* refers to managing administrative documents. Its purity and cleanliness sufficed to offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord and honor ghosts and spirits, thereby teaching the people frugality and moderation. As the *Classic of Filial Piety* says: *"In the Ming Tang, King Wen is venerated in ancestral rites to be paired with the Supreme Lord."*

The sounds and colors, the five flavors, rare treasures from distant lands, and strange, wondrous objects—all these are more than enough to alter the heart and shift the will, to agitate the spirit and stir the blood and *qi*, and their varieties are beyond counting. Yet the resources produced by Heaven and Earth fundamentally do not exceed five—this is the number of the Five Phases. The sage regulates the Five Phases, and thus governance does not fall into chaos. The Five Phases are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Water belongs to the *yin* phase, Fire to the *yang* phase, Wood to the warming phase, Metal to the cooling phase, and Earth to the wind phase. As the five *qi* constantly move, they are called the Five Phases.

In human nature, when the heart is harmonious and desires are fulfilled, there is joy. *Heart harmonious* means neither joy nor anger; *desires fulfilled* means nothing is obstructed. Joy leads to movement, movement to stamping, stamping to swaying, swaying to singing, and singing to dancing. When song and dance are regulated, even birds and beasts leap. In human nature, when the heart is burdened with grief and loss, there is sorrow. *Grief* arises from hardship and difficulty; *loss* refers to separation from what one cherishes. When one is parted from what one loves, there is sorrow, and sorrow causes harm. Grief leads to indignation, indignation to anger, anger to action, and action makes the hands and feet restless. *Restless* means unsettled. Beating the breast and stamping the feet, wailing and weeping—these express sorrow in sending off the deceased.

In human nature, when one is violated or offended, there is anger. Anger causes the blood to surge—when one’s desires are violated, anger swells, and the blood and *qi* become full to assert one’s force. When the blood surges, the *qi* is stirred; when the *qi* is stirred, anger erupts, and when anger erupts, resentment is released. *Release* means to resolve; *resentment* means grievance. Thus, bells and drums, flutes and panpipes, shields and axes, and feathered banners are used to adorn joy. Sackcloth and hempen girdles, staffs of mourning, and the *ju* plant—*ju* refers to hemp with seeds—*cui* is read as the *cui* in *Cuizhu*—and regulated wailing and stamping are used to adorn grief. These are the forms of sorrow, hence the term *adorn*. Weapons and armor, feathered banners, metal drums, axes, and halberds are used to adorn anger.

Only when there is substance is ornamentation applied. In ancient times, when sagely kings ruled above, governance and education were equitable, benevolence and love were pervasive, superiors and inferiors were of one mind, and ruler and minister were harmonious. Clothing and food were abundant, households were provided for, and people were content. Fathers were kind, children filial, elder brothers good, and younger brothers obedient. The living bore no grudges, and the dead held no resentments. In an age of the Dao, people attained their aspirations, so the living bore no grudges. All fulfilled their Heaven-ordained lifespans, so the dead held no resentments. The world was harmonious, and people achieved their wishes. When people rejoiced together without occasion for bestowing favors, the sages created music to harmonize and regulate them. *People* refers to the multitude. Though their hearts rejoiced together, there was a need to express their gratitude, so the sages created music to regulate them, much like a universal system.

In the governance of later ages, fields and fisheries were heavily taxed, passes and markets were strictly levied, weirs and dams were entirely prohibited, nets and traps were nowhere to be set, and plows and hoes had no place to be used. The people’s strength was exhausted by corvée labor, and their wealth was depleted by taxes and levies. *Hui* means calculation—calculating the number of people to exact their taxes. Those who stayed had no food, those who traveled had no provisions, the elderly were not cared for, the dead were not buried, wives were pledged and children sold to meet the demands of superiors, yet still they could not suffice. *Zhui* means to follow in marriage, or in some versions, to rent a wife. Foolish men and simple women all harbored thoughts of wandering and abandonment, and feelings of sorrow and distress. *Wandering* means to be scattered and neglect one’s duties; *sorrow and distress* describe a mournful appearance. *Chong* is read similarly to *zhuyi*’s *□*, a stammering utterance.

Thus, they began to strike great bells, beat resounding drums, blow reed pipes and sheng, and strum zithers and se—losing the root of music. In ancient times, the ruler’s demands were modest, and the people’s needs were met. The lord bestowed his virtue, the minister exhausted his loyalty, the father practiced his kindness, and the son fulfilled his filial piety. *Fulfilled* means to exhaust; *filial piety* means to serve one’s parents well. Each gave their utmost love, and there was no resentment among them. Without resentment, each attained their wishes.

The three-year mourning period was not forcibly imposed—it was not that one was compelled to express the emotions of a filial child, for such emotions arose naturally from within. One did not enjoy listening to music, fine food was not savory, and the heart’s longing could not be severed. The three years of mourning meant that the heart’s longing could not be cut off from sorrow. In later ages, customs declined and manners decayed. Desires multiplied, rites and righteousness were abandoned, ruler and minister deceived one another, and fathers and sons doubted each other. Resentment filled their breasts, and thoughts of loyalty and filial longing were entirely lost—all such thoughts of devotion and remembrance perished. Though they donned mourning garments and hempen girdles, they laughed and jested within them. Even if they observed the three-year period, they lost the root of mourning, which lies in sorrow.

In ancient times, the Son of Heaven had one *ji*, and the feudal lords had one *tong*—a *ji* was a thousand *li* square, and a *tong* was a hundred *li* square. Each guarded their own bounds and did not encroach upon one another. *Bounds* means borders.

Those who do not follow the Kingly Way oppress the myriad people, contend for land and encroach upon territory, disrupt governance and violate prohibitions. When summoned, they do not come; when commanded, they do not obey—this refers to those who disregard the sovereign’s decrees. *Xing* (行) is read as in *xingma* (行马, "barrier"). When forbidden, they do not cease; when admonished, they do not change. *Hui* (诲) means "to teach," and *bian* (变) means "to alter."

Thus, armies are raised to punish them: their rulers are executed, their factions are replaced, their tombs are sealed, and their altars are ritually renewed. If worthy men suffer under a wicked ruler’s punishment, their tombs are honored and cultivated—such as when King Wu punished Zhou and sealed the tomb of Bi Gan. Sacrifices to the altar are called *lei* (类), meaning "to offer sacrifices by category." As the *Odes* says, *"This is the* lei*, this is the* he." Their descendants are divined to succeed them. *Bu* (卜) means to select and establish the worthiest among their descendants.

The Son of Heaven does not extinguish states; the feudal lords do not eradicate lineages—this was the governance of antiquity. In later ages, men were bent on expanding territory and encroaching upon lands, ceaselessly annexing others. They raised unrighteous armies to attack blameless states, slaughtered innocent people, and severed the posterity of former sages—for all people are descendants of emperors and kings, and thus this is called "severing the posterity of former sages." Great states launched attacks, while small states fortified their cities. They drove away others’ cattle and horses, seized others’ sons and daughters—*xi* (傒) is read as *xi* (系, "to bind"), like a prisoner. They destroyed others’ ancestral temples, carried off others’ treasures, blood flowed for a thousand *li*, and exposed corpses filled the wilderness, all to sate the desires of greedy rulers. This is not the purpose for which armies exist.

Armies are established to suppress violence and rectify disorder, not to create it. Thus, armies are for punishing the violent, not for perpetrating violence. Music is for achieving harmony, not for indulgence. Music dispels people’s wayward intentions and preserves their true nature, attaining the mean and harmony—it is not for self-indulgence or excess. Mourning is for fully expressing grief, not for pretense. Mourning rites—wailing and weeping—are for exhausting the filial child’s sorrow, not for feigning false grief.

Thus, in serving parents, there is a Way, and love is the essential duty—the *Dao* (道) being the Way of filial piety, with the duty lying in loving and respecting one’s parents. In court, there is decorum, and reverence is paramount—the court’s decorum is solemn, and while father and son prioritize love, ruler and minister prioritize reverence, hence reverence is held above all. In mourning, there are rites, and sorrow is the essence—*chu* (处) means "to dwell," and mourning rites refer to the three-year observance. As the *Analects* says, *"In mourning, rather than ease, better grief."* Thus, sorrow is the essence. In warfare, there is strategy, and righteousness is the foundation—*shu* (术) means "method," referring to the calculations of yin and yang and the natural patterns of emptiness and fullness. As the tradition states, *"Heaven generates the five materials, and the people use them all; none can be abandoned—who could do away with armies?"* Armies have existed since ancient times: the sagely use them to rise, while the disorderly use them to perish. Their decline or flourishing, survival or ruin, depend on the clarity or obscurity of their methods. Thus, righteousness is the foundation.

When the foundation stands, the Way advances; when the foundation is harmed, the Way decays. *Ben li* (本立) means "righteousness is established," and *ben shang* (本伤) means "righteousness is lost." Hence, the Way decays.

**Governance and the Dao, Part One**

*Main* (主) means "ruler," and *shu* (术) means "Dao/Way." Since the rulers of states govern their domains and command their ministers—from the Five Emperors and Three Kings onward—none have risen without employing the Dao/Way. Thus, it is called *the ruler’s Dao/Way*, and the chapter is titled accordingly.

The ruler’s Dao/Way lies in dwelling in non-action and practicing wordless instruction. *Instruction* (教) means *command* (令), referring to the accomplishment of affairs without speech. Remaining serene and unmoving, maintaining constancy without wavering, following precedent and entrusting matters to subordinates, holding them accountable without toil—this is achieving success without personal labor.

Thus, the mind comprehends plans, and tutors and mentors provide guidance. *Plan* (规) means *strategy* (谋). A *tutor* (师) is one from whom models are drawn, while a *mentor* (傅) is an attendant. Guidance is given through the correct Dao/Way. The mouth speaks, and envoys convey words; the feet walk, and attendants lead the way. *Attendants* (相) serve as models. The ears listen, and upright officials offer remonstrance. *Remonstrance* (谏) may also mean *deliberation* (谋). This applies to the heir apparent in his youth.

Thus, deliberations avoid miscalculations, and strategies avoid errors. *Error* (过) here means *mistake* (误). Words become literary works, and conduct serves as a model for the world, a standard for all under Heaven. Advancing and retreating in accord with the seasons, moving and resting in accordance with principle—neither swayed by ugliness or beauty, nor by favor or disdain; neither rejoicing in rewards and punishments nor angered by them—names are each true to their names, categories to their categories. Affairs proceed as naturally as if nothing originated from the self.

Thus, the kings of antiquity wore the *mian* crown with its hanging strands to veil their sight. The *mian* is the crown of the Son of Heaven. The *liu* strands, adorned with hanging pearls, extend before and behind, descending to the level of the eyes—hence, *veiling sight*. The Son of Heaven’s jade chimes numbered twelve, while dukes and marquises hung nine, ministers six, and earls and viscounts each according to their rank. The *toukuang* filled the ears to block hearing, preventing reckless listening. *Tou* (黈) is read as in *maitou yi zhi tou* (买黈益之黈). The outer screen of the Son of Heaven served as a barrier. *Screen* (屏) refers to a planted wall. The *Erya* states, "The wall within the gate is called a *shu* (树)." The *Analects* says, "The ruler of a state plants a screen at his gate." For feudal lords, it is placed within; for the Son of Heaven, without—hence, *serving as a barrier*.

Thus, governing what is distant ensures presence in what is near; managing what is great ensures holding little. If the eyes recklessly gaze, they become licentious; if the ears recklessly listen, they become deluded; if the mouth recklessly speaks, it causes chaos. These three gates must be guarded with utmost care.

If one seeks to regulate them, one only estranges them. *Regulate* (规) means to align desires, yet this only leads to dispersion. If one seeks to adorn them, one only harms them. *Adorn* (饰) means to embellish; *harm* (贼) means to ruin. Heaven’s *qi* forms the *hun*, and earth’s *qi* forms the *po*. Returning them to the mysterious chamber, each resides in its proper dwelling. Guard them without loss, and they ascend to connect with the Great Unity.

The essence of the Great Unity flows through the Dao/Way of Heaven. The Dao/Way of Heaven is profoundly silent, without form or rule, vast beyond measure, deep beyond fathoming. *Fathoming* (测) means exhausting. Yet it transforms with humanity, though knowledge cannot grasp it. The Dao/Way of Heaven is supremely great—beyond the reach of human intellect.

In ancient times, when Shennong governed the world, his spirit did not race within his breast—his spirit was at peace, undisturbed. His wisdom did not extend beyond the four bounds, for his person remained centered. Embracing a heart of benevolence and completion, *embracing* (怀) means cherishing, timely sweet rains descended, and the five grains flourished. *Flourished* (蕃) means thriving; *grew* (植) means to lengthen. Spring brought life, summer growth, autumn harvest, and winter storage. Monthly inspections and seasonal assessments ensured abundance and completion. At year’s end, achievements were presented, and the new grain was tasted in due season, offered in the Hall of Light. Sacrifices were made in the Hall of Light.

The Hall of Light’s design featured a roof but no walls on four sides, shielding it from wind and rain, cold and heat. One entered with leisurely steps, nurturing the people with impartiality. *Leisurely steps* (迁延) means to wander or linger, as explained in the original text. The people were simple, weighty, upright, and sincere. *Upright* (端) means straight; *sincere* (悫) means complete. They did not contend in anger, yet their wealth sufficed; they did not toil in body, yet their works were accomplished.

Relying on the resources of Heaven and Earth, they harmonized with them. Thus, their authority was stern yet not lethal, punishments were set aside and unused, laws were few yet not burdensome. *Few* (省) means concise; *burdensome* (烦) means excessive. Therefore, their transformation was like that of spirits.

The land extended south to Jiaozhi, north to Youdu—the capital of darkness—east to Yanggu, where the sun rises, and west to Sanwei, the mountain at the westernmost extremity. None failed to heed and obey.

In that era, laws were lenient and punishments mild; prisons stood empty. The world shared a single custom, unified in its ways. No one harbored deceitful intentions.

In the degenerate age that followed, governance was otherwise: rulers coveted without measure, while the people, greedy as wolves, yielded nothing. The people suffered in poverty and contended in anger; their toil bore no fruit. Cunning and deceit sprouted, banditry flourished, and resentment grew between high and low. Decrees went unheeded.

Those in power, rather than returning to the Dao to correct the root, busied themselves with trifles—*busied* (事) meaning to govern. They pared away virtue, heaped up punishments, yet sought order, no different from luring birds with a slingshot or taming dogs with a stick. Chaos only worsened—*worsened* (逾) meaning to increase.

When water grows turbid, fish gasp, their breath short, mouths breaking the surface—a metaphor for panting. When governance turns harsh, the people descend into disorder. Such is the way of things.

Thus, those who raise tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, or elephants build enclosures and cages for them, provide for their desires, regulate their hunger and satiety, and avoid provoking their anger—yet still cannot ensure they live out their natural years, for coercion by punishment constrains them.

When those above abound in schemes, those below abound in deceit—*schemes* (故) meaning cunning. When those above multiply affairs, those below multiply guile; when those above harass and disturb, those below grow unsettled—*unsettled* (不定) meaning they know not what to follow. When those above make many demands, those below contend in strife. To neglect the root and busy oneself with trifles is like scattering dust to quell the air or carrying firewood to extinguish a blaze—*dust* (堁) being fine particles, called *ke* in Chu dialect, the very image of stirred-up dust; *quell* (弥) meaning to suppress.

Thus the sage governs with few affairs and easy rule, seeks little and readily provides—*provides* (瞻) meaning to supply. Without action, there is benevolence; without speech, there is trust; without seeking, there is attainment; without doing, there is accomplishment. Abiding in simplicity, embracing virtue, and extending sincerity—*sincerity* (诚) meaning truth—all under heaven follow as echo answers sound, as shadow follows form. What they cultivate is the root.

As Zhan He said, “Never have I heard of a ruler whose person was well-ordered yet whose state fell into chaos.” Thus what they cultivate is the root. Punishments are insufficient to transform customs; executions are insufficient to forbid villainy. Only spiritual transformation is precious—*spiritual* (神) meaning the utmost refinement.

A loud cry carries no farther than a hundred paces, yet the reach of one’s will extends beyond a thousand miles—*extends* (踰) meaning to penetrate. The warmth of winter’s sun and the cool of summer’s shade draw all things to them, yet none compel them to do so—winter’s creatures turn to the sun, summer’s creatures to the shade, none made to do so, for it is their nature. Thus the image of the utmost refinement comes unbidden, goes without summons, profound and obscure, its agent unknown, yet its work accomplished of itself. The wise cannot recite it; the eloquent cannot describe it.

Long ago, Sunshu Ao lay in tranquil repose, and the people of Ying suffered no harm from his edge—*Ying* being the capital of Chu; *Sunshu Ao*, a minister of Chu. It is said that for three years, he rode a horse without knowing its sex, so great was his virtue. By merely resting in tranquility and nurturing his power, he repelled conflict a thousand miles away; enemy states dared not encroach, and so the people of Ying did not raise arms or send forth expeditions, nor did any harm come to his edge from the four quarters.

Shi Nanyi Liao juggled pellets, and the strife between the two houses did not touch his words—*Shi Nanyi* being a surname, *Xiong* his given name, a brave man dwelling south of the Chu market. When King Ping of Chu’s crown prince Jian was driven out by Fei Wuji and fled to Zheng, the people of Zheng killed him. His son Sheng was in Wu, and Prime Minister Zi Xi summoned him, making him Viscount Bai. Sheng requested to attack Zheng to avenge his father, and Zi Xi agreed but had not yet sent forth the army. When the people of Jin attacked Zheng to avenge their grudge, Zi Xi went to its aid. Sheng grew enraged, saying, “The people of Zheng are here—our enemy is not far!” He wished to kill Zi Xi. His minister Shi Qi said, “Shi Nanyi Xiong can match five hundred men.” They went to see him and told him the matter, but he refused. When they raised a sword against him, he did not flinch; he continued juggling his pellets, his mind undaunted, saying, “I cannot follow you in rebellion, nor will I betray your affairs.” Viscount Bai then killed Zi Xi. Though the two houses faced calamity, they bore no grudge against Shi Nanyi. Thus it is said his words were untouched by their strife.

Armor of leather and iron, glaring eyes and clenched fists—these may ward off blades and spears, yet how distant they are—*distant* (县) meaning far. Compared to virtue, they fall short by far. Contracts, silk, punishments, and axes—these may resolve difficulties, yet how meager they are—*meager* (薄) meaning inferior to virtue. To rely on sight for illumination, on words for commands—these make governance difficult.

When Qu Boyu served as minister, Zigong went to observe him and asked, “How do you govern the state?” He replied, “I govern by non-governance.” *Qu Boyu* being Qu Yuan, a minister of Wei; *Zigong*, a man of Wei, surnamed Duanmu, named Ci, a disciple of Confucius.

When Viscount Jian wished to attack Wei, he sent Shi An to observe it—*Viscount Jian* being a minister of Jin from the Zhao clan; *Shi An* being Shi Mo. *Observe* (觌) meaning to inspect. Upon his return, he reported, “Qu Boyu serves as minister—you cannot send troops against them, for he is virtuous. Even if their defenses were solid and their terrain treacherous, how could you overcome them?”—*overcome* (致) meaning to prevail.

Thus Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and all under heaven suffered no cruel punishments, for there is value in words unspoken—though mute, he judged cases and settled disputes with insight into human nature, thus surpassing those who speak much. Shi Kuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and Jin knew no disorderly governance, for there is value in sight unseen—though blind, he greatly ordered the state of Jin, preventing disorderly governance, thus surpassing those with sight.

Thus commands unspoken, vision unseen—*commands unspoken* referring to Gaoyao’s muteness; *vision unseen* to Shi Kuang’s blindness. This is how Fuxi and Shennong served as teachers—by employing their methods.

Thus the transformation of the people does not follow what is said but what is done—following the intent and conduct of their actions. Thus when Duke Zhuang of Qi favored courage yet did not incite contention, his state faced many crises, which gradually led to the rebellion of Cui Zhu—*Duke Zhuang* being Guang, son of Duke Ling of Qi; *Cui Zhu*, a minister of Qi; *rebellion* referring to the killing of Duke Zhuang.

When King Qingxiang of Chu indulged in sensuality yet did not permit licentious talk, his people grew increasingly disordered, which accumulated until the calamity of Zhao Qi—*King Qingxiang* of Chu; *Zhao Qi*, a minister of Chu.

Thus the movement of the utmost refinement is like the life-giving breath of spring or the withering force of autumn; though messengers gallop and couriers hasten, none can match its swiftness—*swiftness* (亟) meaning speed.

Thus the ruler of men is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a fathom’s span.

Thus, one must be cautious in how one influences others.

When Rong Qiqi plucked a single string, Confucius rejoiced for three days, moved by its harmony. When Zou Ji strummed once, King Wei grieved all night, stirred by its sorrow—*strummed* (徽) meaning to pluck or strike the strings; *King Wei*, father of King Xuan of Qi, lived after the Spring and Autumn period; *徽* is also read as *cuī*, as in mourning garments. When the zither and lute are played, their sounds take form, and they can make others feel joy or sorrow—*grief* here refers to King Wei; *joy* to Confucius.

When laws are set and rewards established, yet customs remain unchanged, it is because sincerity was not truly applied. When Ning Qi sang a merchant’s lament beneath the cart, Duke Huan sighed in sudden awakening—such is the depth to which utmost refinement penetrates. Thus it is said: listen to a people’s music, and you know their customs; see their customs, and you know their transformation.

Confucius learned the zither from Master Xiang—*Master Xiang*, a grand musician of Lu—and discerned King Wen’s aspirations, perceiving the subtle to attain clarity—*discerned* (谕) meaning to instruct; *instructed* here refers to playing King Wen’s melody. When Yanling Jizi heard the music of Lu, he recognized the customs of Yin and Xia, deducing the distant from the near.

What was created in high antiquity endures for a thousand generations without its patterns fading—how much more so for transforming the people of one’s own age? In Tang’s time, when a seven-year drought struck, he prayed with his own body at the edge of Mulberry Grove, and clouds gathered from the four seas—*gathered* (凑) meaning to assemble; some texts write *蒸*, meaning to rise. Rain fell from a thousand *li* away. Embracing authenticity and offering sincerity, he moved heaven and earth; spirits responded beyond the borders, commands were obeyed, and prohibitions heeded—how could this be mere coincidence?

The ancient sage-kings embodied utmost refinement within, forgetting likes and dislikes without—*embodied* (形) meaning to manifest; *likes and dislikes* referring to desires already fulfilled. Their words followed their feelings, their decrees clarified their intent, they arrayed rites and music, and guided with songs and chants. Their legacy flowed through ten thousand generations without obstruction—*flowed* (贯) meaning to pass through; *obstruction* (壅) meaning blockage. It spread across the four directions without limit, and even birds, beasts, and insects were transformed by it—*transformed* (化) meaning to follow; *insects* sometimes written as *spirits*. How much more so for those who enforce laws and issue commands?

Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the next is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent—*violent* (暴) meaning cruelty and disorder. When the balance is applied to left and right, there is no partiality in weight; thus it can be level. When the plumb line is applied within and without, there is no bias in straightness; thus it can be upright. When the ruler in applying the law has no private likes or dislikes, he can issue decrees.

If the balance of weights does not err by even a mosquito’s head—*mosquito’s head* signifying the slightest measure—and the correction of crookedness does not miss by a needle’s tip; if straightness is upheld and perversity is not privately indulged; then the devious cannot bend the law, slander cannot cause chaos, virtue has no place to stand—*stand* (立) meaning to manifest—and resentment has no place to hide. This is governing by technique and freeing the human heart, so the one who governs does not intervene—*does not intervene* meaning governance lies in the Dao, not in cleverness.

A boat floats upon water, a cart rolls upon land—this is the natural course of things. When wood strikes and breaks the axle, when water rages and shatters the boat, one does not resent the wood or stone but blames the skill or clumsiness of the driver or boatman. Knowing the cause, one does not fault the inanimate. Thus, where the Dao has cleverness, there is confusion; where virtue has intent, there is peril; where the mind has sight, there is dizziness—*dizziness* meaning being deluded by things.

No weapon is keener than the will, yet Moye is inferior; no enemy is greater than yin and yang, yet the war drum is small—*small* (小) meaning minor; *keen* (憯) meaning sharp. It is the precision of intent and sincerity that makes a weapon sharp. Laozi said: "Heavily accumulate virtue, and nothing will be unconquerable." Thus Moye is considered inferior. *Enemy* here also means weapon. Applying the principles of yin and yang’s emptiness and fullness is of greatest importance; thus the war drum is minor.

Now, the balance, the compass, and the square are fixed and unchanging; they do not alter for Qin or Chu, nor shift for the Hu or Yue. They remain constant and unerring, upright and unyielding. Once established as law, they are transmitted for ten thousand generations, yet they are enacted through non-action—*non-action* meaning no deliberate effort, for it is self-enacting.

Thus, a state may have a ruined ruler, yet the Dao is never abolished—*ruined ruler* referring to Jie and Zhou; Tang and Wu used their people as the foundation, hence the Dao was not abolished. People may face hardship, yet principle knows no obstruction—*principle* (理) meaning the Dao. From this we see: non-action is the root of the Dao—*root* (宗) meaning the origin.

Thus, one who attains the root of the Dao responds to things without limit; relying on others’ talents is difficult for achieving perfect governance—*talents* (才) meaning intelligence. Tang and Wu were sage rulers, yet they could not ride a *gan*-boat with the Yue people upon rivers and lakes—*gan-boat* being a small, perilous vessel; the Yue were skilled in water, so Tang and Wu could not match them; some say it refers to a large boat. Yi Yin was a worthy minister, yet he could not ride a *yuan*-horse or harness a *taotu* with the Hu people—*yuan* being a yellow horse with a white belly, as in the *Book of Songs*: "Four *yuan* horses gallop"; *taotu* being a wild horse, familiar to the Hu, so Yi Yin could not master it. Confucius and Mozi were broadly learned, yet they could not enter the thickets and perilous paths with mountain dwellers—*Confucius* being Kongzi; *Mozi* being Mo Di; *thickets* (榛) being dense woods, *perilous paths* (薄险阻) being deep grasses and treacherous terrain, familiar to mountain dwellers, so Kong and Mo could not traverse them; *阻* is sometimes written as *涂*.

From this we see: human knowledge of things is shallow. To seek to illuminate all within the seas and preserve the ten thousand directions, without relying on the methods of the Dao and instead relying solely on one’s own ability, is to reach an impasse without understanding. Thus, intelligence alone is insufficient to govern the world.

Jie’s strength could break rhinoceros horns and bend metal hooks, pull iron cables and compress metal, move great sacrificial oxen, drown giant turtles and alligators in water, and capture bears and brown bears on land—*horns* (觡) meaning antlers.

Rope is twisted. *Xi* (歙) is read as *xie*. Yet Tang, with three hundred war chariots, besieged Jie at Mingtiao and captured him at Jiaomen—*Jiao* (焦) is sometimes written as *Chao* (巢). From this we see: bravery and strength are insufficient to uphold the world.

Intelligence is insufficient for governance, courage insufficient for might—thus it is clear that human talent alone cannot bear the task. Yet those who rule others, without descending from their ancestral halls, know what lies beyond the four seas: they recognize things through things, and know people through people.

Thus, what pooled strength can lift, no wealth can resist; what collective wisdom can achieve, nothing can fail to accomplish. A pit well holds no giant turtles or alligators—it is too narrow. A garden contains no towering trees—it is too small. One who lifts a heavy cauldron may lack the strength to raise it, yet when moving it, even the weak can shift it without needing great force. Thus, a thousand men together do not break a bridge, and ten thousand gathered do not abandon a task.

The swift horses *Hualiu* and *Lü’er* can reach a thousand *li* in a day, yet when made to seize a hare, they are no match for wolves and jackals—their skills differ. *Shu* (殊) means "different." The owl snatches fleas and mosquitoes at night, discerning the finest autumn hairs, yet by day it stumbles and cannot see mountains—its nature is contrary. The owl, a kind of *chixiu* (鸱鸺), is called the "old hare," crying on rooftops at night. At night its eyes are sharp, gathering human fingernails into its nest, hence it discerns the finest details; by day it sees nothing, hence its nature is perverse.

The flying serpent glides through mist and moves, the responding dragon rises with the clouds, the ape is swift when it has trees, and the fish is swift when it has water. *Wu* (鹜) means "swift." Thus, in ancient times, those who made chariots did not paint what was lacquered, nor carve what was chiseled. Craftsmen had no second skill, officials held no second post—each guarded their duty and did not encroach upon others. *Jian* (奸) means "disorder." People found their proper place, things found their peace, so tools were not flawed, and duties were not neglected. *Ku* (苦) is read as *jian*. *Man* (嫚) refers to trapping tools; *man* (嫚) is read as "slack."

Those burdened with little find repayment easy; those with few duties find them easy to uphold. Few burdens are easy to weigh. *Quan* (权) means "plan." The ruler holds to simplicity above, and below, the people offer easily accomplished work. Thus, lord and minister endure long without wearying of one another. *Yan* (厌) means "deceive."

The way of ruling others is like the *shi* (尸) in the scattered stars—the *shi*, the master of the sacrifice. When the *shi* is sated, one knows the spirits are sated. As the *Odes* says: "The lordly *shi* feasts and drinks, in the ancestral temple, solemn and reverent." Solemn and silent, it receives good fortune. The *shi* does not speak, hence it is called "profound silence."

Thus, one who attains the Dao does not feign ugliness or false goodness, nor adorn themselves with beauty, nor strive for extreme virtue. One person may wear it without praise—*bao* (褒) means "exalt." Ten thousand may receive it without constraint. *Meng* (蒙) means "cover." *Bian* (褊) means "narrow." Thus, to value bestowing kindness is like valuing inflicting violence—then the way of governance flows smoothly. *Tong* (通) means "to follow."

One who bestows kindness scatters rewards. Without merit, there are lavish rewards; without labor, there are high ranks—then those who hold office grow lax, and idlers rush to advance. One who inflicts violence metes out punishments arbitrarily. The innocent die, the upright are punished—then those who cultivate themselves do not strive for goodness, and the wicked lightly offend their superiors. One cannot but be cautious.

Thus, bestowing kindness breeds treachery, and inflicting violence breeds chaos. A custom of treachery and chaos is the wind of a ruined state. *Feng* (风) means "transformation." Therefore, when a wise ruler governs, if the state executes someone, the ruler bears no anger—acting according to law, hence no anger. If the court rewards someone, the lord takes no part—acting according to merit, hence no involvement.

Those punished do not resent the ruler, for their crimes warrant it; those rewarded do not feel indebted to their superior, for their achievements earn it. The people know that rewards and punishments come from their own actions, so they strive for merit and cultivate their work, not relying on the ruler’s gifts. *Gan* (赣) means "things." Thus, the court is clear and leaves no traces, the fields are opened and bear no weeds—hence, in the highest age, even those below know this way.

Consider the upright post of the well-sweep, standing firm and unmoving, bending and rising to draw water—*qiao* (桥) is the crossbeam of the well-sweep, *zhi* (植) is the post that balances the lever. Its movement, bending and rising, is controlled by the post. This is a metaphor for the ruler. The lord is still and silent, not restless—*zao* (躁) means "agitated"—so the hundred officials can fulfill their duties.

It is like the one who holds the banner in an army: if they point recklessly, all is thrown into chaos. Cleverness is insufficient for great peace, wisdom insufficient for securing danger. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to cover one’s brilliance and return to cultivating the Dao. "Insufficient for great peace" refers to petty kindness; "insufficient for securing danger" refers to petty wisdom. Such a person, seeking to praise Yao and condemn Jie to establish a reputation for discerning good and evil, may still encounter those of stubborn knowledge—better to conceal brilliance and return to the great Dao, swiftly achieving true renown. The way of the lord is like this.

Serene and inactive, Heaven grants the seasons; incorrupt and frugal, keeping to moderation, Earth produces wealth. When the lord’s virtue is thus, Heaven grants the seasons—as with Tang and Wu—and Earth produces wealth—as with Shennong and Houji. Embracing simplicity and praising virtue, the sages devise plans, like Yi Yin for Tang or Fu Yue for Gaozong. Mencius said: "Yi Yin bore the task of a sage." The *Guoyu* says: "Wu Ding sought sages through images and found Fu Yue at Fu Rock."

Thus, the lowly are drawn to the myriad things, and the empty are bequeathed the world.

To bequeath is to bestow. When the lord governs, his perception is clear and unobscured, his mind empty and his will yielding. Thus, all ministers converge like spokes to a hub, and none—whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy—fails to exhaust their abilities. Only then does he begin to set forth ritual, establishing it as the foundation. To establish is to erect; foundation is the enterprise.

He harnesses the collective power as his chariot and guides the collective wisdom as his steed. Though the path be deep and perilous, he shall never be led astray. Deep means remote; perilous, distant. The lord dwells in seclusion to avoid damp and dryness, his inner chambers layered to guard against treachery. Within, he knows not the affairs of the lanes; without, he knows not the forms of mountains and marshes. Yet beyond the curtains, though his eyes cannot see ten *li* ahead nor his ears hear a hundred paces afar, nothing in the world remains unknown to him. To know is to comprehend. The channels through which knowledge flows are vast, and those who weigh and measure it are many.

Thus, without stepping beyond his door, he knows all under Heaven; without peering through his window, he knows the Dao of Heaven. Riding the wisdom of the multitude, nothing under Heaven is beyond his reach. Relying solely on his own mind, even his own person cannot be preserved. To preserve is to guard.

Therefore, the lord covers all with virtue, does not act by his own wisdom, and follows what benefits the myriad people. When he lifts his heel to seek what benefits the world, the hundred clans bear him aloft without feeling his weight; they place him before them without obstruction; they raise him without perceiving his height; they advance him without wearying. To be exalted is to be raised without self-awareness of loftiness. To advance is to seek and to serve.

The lord’s Dao is round: it revolves without end, for end means limit. His transformative nurturance is divine, empty and following the natural course, ever yielding and never leading. The minister’s Dao is also round: it revolves without fixed direction, judging rightness to act appropriately, initiating affairs, and upholding duties with clarity to achieve success.

Thus, when lord and minister follow distinct Daos, there is order, and their harmony cannot be altered. When they share the same Dao, there is chaos. If the lord deems something acceptable and the minister also says it is acceptable, if the lord deems something unacceptable and the minister also says it is unacceptable, this is sameness. Without mutual correction, it is called chaos.

When each attains what is fitting and occupies their proper place, superiors and inferiors have means to employ one another. The lord fulfills the lord’s Dao, the minister fulfills the minister’s Dao—this is called attaining what is fitting. When the lord governs with a mind yielding in intent and perception clear yet unobscured, all ministers converge like spokes to a hub, and none—whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy—fails to exhaust their abilities. Then the lord attains the means to govern his ministers, and the ministers attain the means to serve their lord. The Dao of governing the state is thus illuminated.

King Wen was wise yet fond of inquiry, hence his sagacity. Fond of inquiry, he wished to share merit with others. King Wu was brave yet fond of inquiry, hence his victory—his triumph over Yin. For he who rides the wisdom of the multitude can undertake anything; he who employs the strength of the multitude can overcome anything.

A weight of a thousand *jun*—even Wu Huo could not lift it. A *jun* equals ten thousand *jin*. Wu Huo was the mighty warrior of King Wu of Qin. When the king tested his strength by having him lift a great tripod, his wrist gave way and he could not bear it—hence it is said he could not lift it. Yet when the multitude unites as one, even a hundred men have strength to spare.

Thus, to rely on the strength of a single man is to find even Wu Huo insufficient—for he could not prevail, and so cannot be depended upon. But he who harnesses the control of the multitude finds the whole world not enough to contain him. With many hands and mighty force, even the world seems small—hence it is said there is not enough to possess.

Yu dredged the Yangtze and channeled the Yellow River to bring benefit to all under heaven, yet he could not make the waters flow westward. Ji cleared the land and tilled the soil to encourage the people to devote themselves to agriculture, yet he could not make grain grow in winter. Was this because human effort fell short? No—it was the nature of things that made it impossible. When the momentum of circumstances cannot be forced, and one does not follow the principles of the Dao, even the most divine sage cannot bring success—how much less a ruler of the present age?

A weak horse pulling a heavy load—even Zaofu could not make it go far. Zaofu was the master charioteer of King Mu of Zhou. But with a light carriage and fine horses, even an average driver can make them run swiftly. Thus, when the sage undertakes a task, how could he go against the principles of the Dao or defy the nature of things—twisting the crooked into straight, bending the bent into extended? He has never failed to work with what is given.

Therefore, what pooled strength can lift is never too heavy to overcome, and what collective wisdom can accomplish is never too difficult to achieve. The deaf may be made to shout orders, but not to hear; the mute may be made to guard the gates, but not to speak. The body has its limitations, and abilities have their bounds.

Thus, one form occupies one position, and one skill serves one task. When strength matches the burden, the lifter does not find it heavy; when ability suits the task, the doer does not find it difficult. Whether great or small, long or short, when each is fittingly employed, the world becomes as one, with none surpassing another. The sage employs all without discarding any talent.

The ruler values uprightness and esteems loyalty. When loyalty and uprightness hold high office, governing affairs with rectitude, then flatterers, deceivers, and treacherous men have no way to advance. It is like squares and circles not covering each other, or curves and straight lines not fitting together.

Birds and beasts cannot flock together because their kinds differ; tigers and deer do not roam together because their strength is unequal. Thus, when the sage attains his will and holds high position, those who would slander, deceive, or offend the ruler are like sparrows facing a hawk or mice encountering a wildcat—they will surely not survive. Therefore, every move a ruler makes must be made with utmost care.

When those he appoints are the right people, the state is well-governed, superiors and inferiors are in harmony, ministers are loyal, and the people are devoted. But when those he appoints are not the right people, the state is in peril, superiors and inferiors are at odds, ministers are resentful, and the people are in chaos. Thus, a single misstep can bring lifelong harm. The key to success or failure lies in the ruler’s hands.

When the plumb line hangs straight above, the wood below is straight—not because it has been worked upon, but because it follows what it relies upon to be set right. If the ruler is truly upright, honest officials take up their duties while the wicked hide themselves. If the ruler is not upright, the treacherous prevail while the loyal withdraw.

Why is it that people do not carve jade and stone but do carve gourds and melons? Jade and stone are hard—knives cannot penetrate them, so they are not carved. There is nothing to be gained from jade and stone, so they are left untouched. If the ruler holds to rectitude and fairness, following the plumb line to measure high and low, then when ministers come with deceit, it is like throwing eggs against stone or fire into water.

King Ling of Chu favored slender waists, and his people starved themselves to become thin. King Goujian of Yue prized courage, and his people risked death in reckless contests. From this, we see that the handle of power and influence can transform customs.

When Yao was a common man, he could not bring benevolence to a single village; when Jie sat on the throne, his commands were obeyed and his prohibitions enforced. From this, it is clear that virtue alone is not enough to govern, but power can change customs.

The *Book of Documents* says: "When one man has cause for celebration, the myriad people rely on him." This is what it means.

The world is often dazzled by reputation and rarely examines reality. Thus, recluses are honored for their fame, and wanderers are exalted for their eloquence. When we examine what is honored and exalted, we find no other reason than that the ruler does not clearly distinguish the grounds of advantage and harm, and so values the glibness of many tongues.

In governing the state, it is not so. Those who speak must be thoroughly examined by the law, and those who act must be governed by their offices. The ruler holds them to their titles and demands their results; ministers uphold their duties to demonstrate their achievements. Words must not exceed reality, and actions must not transgress the law. Ministers converge like spokes to a hub, none daring to usurp the ruler’s authority.

If a matter lies outside the law but can benefit the state and aid governance, it must be carefully considered through the five phases, secretly investigated to observe its outcome, and thoroughly examined through comprehensive inquiry. Without bias toward one aspect or partiality toward one affair, the ruler stands at the center, his illumination extending throughout the world.

When ministers are impartial and upright, none dare act perversely—impartiality being square and uprightness being straight. All officials fulfill their duties, striving to manifest their public deeds. The ruler, keen and discerning above, spurs officials to diligence below; treachery and deceit vanish without trace, and the myriad achievements advance daily. Thus the valiant exhaust themselves in the military, devoting all strength to martial merit.

In a disordered state, it is not so. Those with many admirers receive rewards despite no merit, while those who uphold their posts are punished despite no crime. The ruler above hears yet does not discern; ministers form cliques and disloyalty. Sophists wander in rhetoric, and the self-cultivated vie in self-aggrandizement—self-aggrandizement being self-benefit. When the ruler issues commands, they oppose them with partisanship; where laws forbid, they transgress with perversity, using factionalism to slander the ruler’s decrees and indulge in their own treachery. The cunning devote themselves to craft and deceit; the bold engage in strife and contention. High ministers monopolize power; petty officials wield influence. Factions form alliances, toying with their sovereign. Though the state may appear to endure, the ancients would call it already lost.

Moreover, to neglect official duties yet don armor, to forsake the southern fields yet gain renown as a sage—this is no way to govern a state. The *qiji* and *luer*, the swiftest horses under heaven, if driven will not advance and if reined will not halt, even a fool would not mount them. Now the signs of order and chaos are as visible as wheel tracks, yet rulers of the age fail to perceive them—this is why the Way of governance is obstructed.

Power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; ranks and emoluments are the ministers’ reins and bit. Thus the ruler occupies the pivot of power and authority, wields the handle of ranks and emoluments, carefully measures the degree of urgency, and aptly adjusts the rhythm of giving and taking. Thereby the world exerts its strength tirelessly.

The bond between ruler and minister is not one of fatherly kindness or kinship. Yet they exhaust their strength and risk death without sparing their bodies—why? The dynamics of power compel them. In former times, Yu Rang was a minister of Zhonghang Wenzi. Wenzi was Xun Yin, son of Zhonghang Muzi, a Jin grandee. When Zhibo attacked the Zhonghang clan and annexed their lands, Yu Rang abandoned his lord to serve Zhibo. Zhibo later battled Zhao Xiangzi at the foot of Jinyang, where he was killed and his corpse desecrated, his state divided into three parts held by Han, Wei, and Zhao—this was his fortune. Yu Rang sought to avenge Zhao Xiangzi, to repay Zhibo’s enmity by assassinating Xiangzi. He painted his body to resemble leprosy, swallowed charcoal to alter his voice, and knocked out his teeth to disguise his appearance.

How could one man’s heart serve two lords—abandoning one, then willing to die for the other? Was it not the difference in the weight of their favor and disfavor? The force of human kindness and grace made it so. When Zhou ruled all under heaven and received the homage of the feudal lords, wherever human footsteps reached or boats and oars traversed, none failed to submit. Yet King Wu, with but three thousand armored soldiers, captured him at Muye. Was it that the people of Zhou were willing to die for principle while the people of Yin rebelled? No—it was the depth of their lord’s virtue and power and the efficacy of his commands.

As fierce winds stir waves and lush trees draw birds, these are the workings of mutually engendering *qi*. Thus when ministers cannot obtain what they desire from the ruler, the ruler likewise cannot secure what he seeks from his ministers. The ruler’s bestowal upon his ministers is met by their reciprocation—this is the dynamic of mutual exchange. Therefore, ministers exhaust their strength and die for principle to serve their lord, while the ruler calculates their merits and confers ranks upon them. Thus the ruler cannot reward ministers without merit, nor can ministers die for a lord without virtue. If the ruler’s virtue does not flow down to the people yet he seeks to employ them, it is like whipping a horse’s hooves—like expecting crops to ripen without waiting for rain, an impossibility in the art of governance.

**Governance and the Way of Rulership (Part II)**

The Way of ruling over others begins with stillness to cultivate the self and frugality to lead those below. Stillness ensures the people are not disturbed; frugality ensures they do not resent. If the people are disturbed, governance falls into chaos; if they resent, the ruler’s virtue is meager. When governance is chaotic, the worthy will not offer counsel; when virtue is meager, the brave will not die for their lord.

Thus, when a ruler delights in startled birds and fierce beasts, treasures rare and strange objects, values gold and jade as precious, and regards the uncanny as marvelous, the extraordinary as wondrous—when he is restless and indolent, *kang* (at ease) and *huang* (disorderly), sparing no care for the people’s strength, galloping in the hunt, coming and going at untimely hours—then his officials will be consumed by chaos, affairs will labor the resources to exhaustion, and the myriad people will suffer in bitterness, their livelihoods neglected.

When a ruler favors lofty towers and deep ponds, intricate carvings and elaborate engravings, embroidered robes with *fu* (black-and-white patterns) and *fu* (blue-and-red designs), fine linen and coarse cloth, silk brocade, treasured jewels and jade—where *fu* is woven from black and white, *fu* from blue and red, *chi* and *xi* are made of kudzu (fine and coarse), and five colors compose embroidery—then taxes will be levied without measure, and the strength of the myriad people will be utterly spent.

When Yao possessed the realm, it was not out of greed for the wealth of the people or to secure his own position. Rather, seeing the people oppressed by force, the strong bullying the weak, the many tyrannizing the few, Yao personally practiced the conduct of moderation and frugality, illuminating the virtue of mutual care to harmonize and unite them. Thus, his thatched roof remained untrimmed, his rafters unhewn; his great carriage (*dalu*, the supreme four-horse chariot) went undecorated—though the Son of Heaven rides with six horses, Yao’s bore no paint, no ornament. His mats were woven from rushes, unhemmed; his grand broth was unseasoned, lacking the five flavors. His coarse grain was not husked to fineness. He toured the realm to teach, toiling for all under Heaven, circling the Five Peaks. Was his sustenance insufficient for joy? He lifted the realm to serve the altars of soil and grain, yet sought no profit therein.

As his years advanced and his resolve grew heavy with sorrow—for *shuai* means aged, and *min*, distress—he offered up all under Heaven to Shun as easily as stepping backward to shed one’s sandals. Such was the ease of his yielding.

Yet in a declining age, it is otherwise: the moment one assumes the throne and the power of rulership, the people’s strength is exhausted to gratify the ruler’s senses. His will fixates on palaces and terraces, ponds and parks, fierce beasts and black bears, curiosities and rarities. Thus, the poor go hungry, their husks and chaff unfit for their mouths, while tigers and wolves, bears and black bears feast on fine fodder. The common folk lack whole garments of coarse cloth, yet the palace walls shimmer with embroidered silks. The ruler hastens to these useless works, and the black-haired people grow gaunt throughout the realm—for *li* means the masses.

Thus, the world cannot rest in its nature, nor preserve its true essence, and deceit arises. The ruler’s abode is like the radiance of sun and moon, toward which all under Heaven turn their sidelong gaze, strain their ears to hear, stretch their necks, and rise on tiptoe in hope. Therefore, without detachment, virtue cannot be made luminous; without tranquility, the distant cannot be attained; without magnanimity, all cannot be sheltered; without kindness and generosity, the multitude cannot be embraced; without impartiality and rectitude, judgments cannot be rendered.

Thus, the worthy ruler employs people as a skilled craftsman shapes wood: the large pieces become hulls, oars, pillars, and beams—for *zhou* means boat, and *hang*, two boats lashed together to ferry across. The small become oars and sculls; the long, eaves and rafters—for *lü* are the eaves, and *cui*, the rafters. The short become caryatids and corbels—for *zhuru* are the kneeling figures atop beams, and *ji* is read like *ji* (chicken). Whether large or small, long or short, each finds its proper place; compass and square, circle and square, each has its use.

Among all things under Heaven, none is more poisonous than *jidu* (monkshood). Yet the skilled physician gathers and stores it, for it has its use. Thus, even the timber of forests and thickets is not to be discarded—how much less a person?

Now, those whom the court does not promote, whom the village lanes do not praise, are not necessarily unworthy; rather, the office to which they are assigned does not suit them. When a deer ascends a mountain, even the river deer cannot keep pace; yet when it descends, even a shepherd boy can pursue it—for abilities have their strengths and limits.

Therefore, one of grand strategy cannot be charged with nimble dexterity—for *lüe* means the Way of conduct. One of minor wit cannot be entrusted with great tasks. People have their talents, things have their forms; to burden one with a weight too heavy, or to task a hundred with what remains too light—this is folly. Thus, he who scrutinizes the minutest calculations will surely lose the great reckonings of the world—for *yi* means to lose. He who does not overlook the smallest details may falter in great undertakings. It is like expecting a wildcat to wrestle an ox, or a tiger to catch a mouse.

Now, some possess the talent to pacify the Nine Provinces, unite the lands beyond, preserve imperiled states, and restore broken lineages. Their resolve lies in the straight Way and correcting the crooked, in resolving entanglements and restoring order. Yet they are instead constrained by the etiquette of inner chambers and the trivialities of secluded halls. Others, with obsequious cunning and petty skills, flatter and fawn, curry favor with local customs, and lower themselves to the level of the common crowd. Yet these are entrusted with the reins of the world and the pivot of order—for *ji* means governance.

This is like shearing wool with an axe or prying wood with a knife—for *jian* is read like *zan* (to shear), and *zan* like the *zan* in *jingzan* (to gather). All lose their proper measure. For *yi* means fitting.

The ruler employs the eyes of all under heaven to see, the ears of all under heaven to hear, the wisdom of all under heaven to deliberate, and the strength of all under heaven to contend. Thus, his decrees penetrate to the lowest levels, and the sentiments of his ministers reach his ears—*wen* means to reach. The hundred offices are well-ordered and interconnected, while the assembled ministers converge like spokes around a hub. Hence the term *fucou* (convergence). He does not reward with gifts in times of joy nor punish with execution in times of anger, fearing misjudgment. Therefore, his authority is established without decay, his intelligence and clarity lead without obscurity—*bi* means darkness. His laws and commands are discerning without being oppressive—*cha* means clarity, *ke* means vexation. His senses are keen without blindness, and the truth or falsehood of matters is laid daily before him without obstruction. Thus, the worthy exhaust their wisdom, the unworthy exert their strength, virtue and grace extend universally without partiality, and all ministers strive diligently without slackening—*dai* means negligence. Those near are at ease in their nature, and those far are drawn to his virtue—*xing* means life, *huai* means to return. Why is this so? Because he has mastered the Way of employing others and does not rely solely on his own talents.

Thus, one who borrows a carriage and horses does not tire his feet yet travels a thousand *li*; one who rides a boat and oars cannot swim yet crosses rivers and seas—*jue* means to traverse. The ruler’s desire is to gather the wisdom of all within the seas and exhaust the strength of the multitude, yet those ministers whose aspirations are fulfilled and who offer loyal service rarely avoid endangering themselves—*kun* means peril. If their words are correct, even if they come from a commoner or a gatherer of firewood, they must not be discarded. Though their speech may be base, if it is right, it must not be cast aside. If their words are wrong, even if they come from a minister or ruler deliberating in the ancestral temple, they may not be used—*renjun* refers to the lord of a state, *yu* means to present, *ce* means counsel. Though their words be wrong, even if they are punished—*kui* means penalty—the right and wrong of a matter cannot be judged by the noble or base, the exalted or lowly.

Thus, the enlightened ruler, in listening to his ministers, deems their plans usable without shame for their lowly station. If their words are practicable, he does not fault their eloquence—he does not fault their florid speech. The benighted ruler acts otherwise: those he loves, befriends, and keeps close, though crooked and unrighteous, he cannot perceive; those distant, lowly, and humble, though they exhaust their strength in loyal service, he cannot recognize. Those who speak are silenced with sophistry, and those who remonstrate are punished with crimes. Ruling thus and wishing to illuminate all within the seas and preserve the myriad regions is like stopping one’s ears to distinguish clear and muddy sounds—*shang* tones are clear, *gong* tones are muddy—or covering one’s eyes to see blue and yellow. Such a ruler strays far from intelligence and clarity—*li* means to depart.

The law is the measure of all under heaven and the standard of the ruler. To suspend the law is to judge what is lawful and what is not; to establish rewards is to reward what deserves reward. Once the law is fixed, those who meet its standards are rewarded, and those who fall short are punished. The exalted are not lightly excused from penalty, nor are the lowly excessively burdened with punishment—this is called balance. Those who violate the law, though virtuous, must be punished; those who meet the standard, though unworthy, must go unpunished. Thus, the public Way is opened, and the private path is blocked—*gong* means upright, *si* means crooked, *se* means closed.

In ancient times, officials were appointed—*you si* likely refers to judicial officers—to restrain the people and prevent them from acting wantonly—*zi* means unrestrained. The ruler was established to restrain these officials and prevent them from acting arbitrarily—*zhuan* means to usurp. Laws, records, rites, and propriety exist to restrain the ruler and prevent him from acting on his own authority. When none may act wantonly, the Way prevails, and when the Way prevails, order is achieved. Thus, one returns to *wuwei* (non-action). *Wuwei* does not mean stagnation or inaction but that one’s words do not originate from oneself.

An inch is born from the *fu*, the *fu* from the *ri*, the *ri* from the *xing*, and the *xing* from the *jing*—this is the foundation of measurement. The *fu* is the awn of a grain stalk, such as the tip of a millet ear. Ten *fu* make one *fen*, ten *fen* make one *cun* (inch), ten *cun* make one *chi* (foot), and ten *chi* make one *zhang*. This is the foundation of governance.

Music arises from sound, sound from pitch, and pitch from the wind—this is the origin of voice. *Origin* also means *foundation*. Law arises from righteousness, righteousness from the collective good, and the collective good accords with the human heart—this is the essence of governance. *Essence* means to unify the many.

Thus, one who comprehends the foundation is not confused by its branches; one who perceives the essence is not bewildered by details. *Bewildered* means *dazzled*. Law is neither fallen from heaven nor sprung from the earth but emerges among men and then returns to correct them. *Returns* means *reverts*.

Therefore, what one possesses oneself, one does not condemn in others—possessing it oneself means having keen discernment. Not condemning it in others means extending forbearance to their conduct. What one lacks oneself, one does not demand of others—though one may lack unique insight, one does not impose blame on others. What is established below is not abandoned above: the ruler’s laws and prohibitions for the people are also practiced by himself. *Not abandoned above* means adhering to the law. What is forbidden to the people is not done by himself—improper deeds are not committed in private.

This is rectifying oneself to rectify others.

What is called a ruined state is not one without a ruler but one without law. Those who alter the law are not without law but possess law yet do not apply it—this is the same as having no law. *Same* means *equal*.

Thus, when a ruler establishes law, he first makes himself its model and standard. *Standard* means *rectitude*. Only then do his commands prevail throughout the land.

Confucius said: “When his person is correct, his commands are obeyed without being issued; when his person is not correct, though he issue commands, they are not followed.” Therefore, when prohibitions prevail over oneself, commands are obeyed by the people. *Prohibitions prevail over oneself* means not daring to violate them oneself—thus one’s commands are obeyed by the people.

The governance of a sagely ruler resembles the driving of Zaofu: harmony is achieved through the reins, urgency and ease through the harmony of his lips, proper measure within his breast, and control through the grip of his hands. *Control* means the switch. Within, it accords with his heart; without, it aligns with the horse’s will. Thus, he can advance and retreat in perfect straightness—*straightness* means *rectitude*—and turn in curves that fit the compass—*curves* means *bends*, *compass* means *circle*. He travels great distances with energy to spare, for he has truly mastered the art.

Thus, authority and power are the ruler’s chariot, and great ministers are the ruler’s team of four horses. If one’s body abandons the comfort of the chariot and one’s hands lose the hearts of the team, one cannot avoid danger—this has never been seen from ancient times to the present.

Therefore, if chariot and horses are not in harmony, even Wang Liang cannot travel the Way; if ruler and ministers are not in accord, even Yao and Shun cannot achieve good governance. If one wields the art of governance to control them, even the wisdom of Guan [Zhong] and Yan [Ying] is exhausted; if one clarifies duties to instruct them, even the treachery of Zhi and Zhuang Qiao ceases. *Zhi* was a robber in Confucius’ time. *Zhuang Qiao* was a general under King Wei of Chu, capable of great banditry.

Gazing into a well from the edge of a terrace, though one’s vision be sharp, one still cannot see the pupils of one’s eyes—*pupils* means the dark centers of the eyes.

If one borrows the clarity of a mirror to illuminate them, then even minute distinctions can be discerned. *Mirror* means a reflective surface. *Distinctions* refers to fine hairs, or alternatively, flaws.

Thus, the enlightened ruler’s ears and eyes do not labor, his spirit is not exhausted; when things arrive, he observes their forms, and when affairs come, he responds to their transformations. What is near does not fall into chaos, and what is distant is governed. Therefore, he does not rely on chance calculations but follows the inevitable Dao, so that in ten thousand undertakings, nothing is left unplanned.

Now, consider the charioteer: when the horse’s body is attuned to the carriage and the driver’s mind is in harmony with the horse, then traversing perilous paths and reaching distant places, advancing and retreating, circling and roaming—none of these fail to accord with his will. Even if there are fine steeds like Qilin or Lü’er, if a mere servant drives them, the horses will turn willful, and the man will be unable to control them. *Zang Huo* refers to an incompetent driver from Lu in ancient times.

Thus, in governance, one does not prize self-righteousness but values preventing wrongdoing. Therefore, it is said: Do not let desires arise, and do not say they will not be sought; do not let things be seized, and do not say they will not be contested. In this way, personal talents are set aside, and the public Dao prevails. The beautiful are measured by standards, and the insufficient are established in their uses—thus, all within the seas may be unified.

If one abandons official duties to heed praise and blame, discards public service for cliques and factions—*public* means upright—then extraordinary talents will rise recklessly and disrupt proper order. *Extraordinary talents* refers to those beyond the ordinary. *Rise recklessly* means they suddenly act without pure virtue, hence disrupting proper order. If those who hold office are thus obstructed and do not advance, then the customs of the people will be thrown into chaos, and meritorious ministers will vie for power at court. When those of extraordinary talent rise recklessly to surpass their proper rank, meritorious ministers, though their achievements are great, will not be duly recognized—hence the contention at court.

Thus, laws and measures are the means by which the ruler controls his subordinates—*control* means to restrain. To discard and not employ them is like driving without reins, and the ministers and common people will instead toy with their superior.

Therefore, with the Dao, one controls others; without it, one is controlled by others—being seized and restrained by others. A fish capable of swallowing a boat, if it strays and loses the water, will be controlled by ants—it has left its dwelling. *A fish capable of swallowing a boat* signifies its great size. *Its dwelling* is the water. A gibbon or martin, if it loses its tree, will be captured by foxes and wildcats—it is not in its proper place. *Its proper place* is a dense forest.

If the ruler of men abandons what he should uphold and contends with his ministers, entrusting finances to officials while holding his position through inaction—having no means to maintain his position—then those who hold office will curry favor with the ruler, following his desires to ingratiate themselves. Thus, ministers conceal their wisdom and do not employ it—refusing to offer their counsel to assist their superior—and instead shift their responsibilities onto him. When worthy ministers see that he is unwilling to accept their plans, they shift the burden back to him, forcing him to take control himself.

As the *Odes* says: "Zhongshan Fu was both enlightened and wise, thus preserving himself." The wealthy and noble regard labor as beneath them; those who understand affairs regard scrutiny as unnecessary; the arrogant and willful regard deference as unworthy, for their power does not equal the ruler’s.

If the ruler of men does not employ ability—failing to utilize the wisdom and talents of his ministers—but prefers to act on his own, then his wisdom will daily grow weary, and he will bear the burden alone. When his plans are repeatedly thwarted below, he cannot extend his governance; when his conduct falters in the state, he cannot maintain sole authority. If his wisdom is insufficient for governance and his might insufficient to execute punishments, then he will have no means to engage with the world.

When joy and anger take shape in the heart and desire to manifest outwardly, those who hold office will abandon uprightness and flatter their superior—*flatter* means to bend in compliance. Officials will distort the law to follow the wind—*wind* means command. Rewards will not match merit, and punishments will not fit crimes; superiors and subordinates will grow estranged, and ruler and ministers will resent one another. Thus, those in power will pander to the ruler, and when faults arise, there will be no means to hold them accountable. If crimes go unpunished, the hundred officials will grow disordered, and wisdom will be unable to resolve it. Slander and praise will arise, and clarity will be unable to illuminate them.

If one does not correct the root but instead cultivates oneself, the ruler will grow ever more labored, and his ministers ever more idle. This is like taking the place of the kitchen chef to butcher the sacrificial animal or acting as the master carpenter to hew the wood. Racing a horse on foot, one’s sinews will snap before catching up; mounting the chariot and taking the reins, the horse will die beneath the crossbar.

Thus, when Bo Le appraises the horse, Wang Liang drives it, and the enlightened ruler rides it, one may reach a thousand *li* without the labor of driving or appraising—riding upon the resources of others as if they were wings. *Resources* means talent.

Therefore, the ruler of men practices non-action while maintaining firmness, acts without personal preferences—having no private inclinations. If he acts, slander arises; if he has preferences, flattery emerges. Flatterers seize upon his will and rise.

In the past, Duke Huan of Qi loved fine flavors, and Yi Ya cooked his own firstborn son to feed him. *Duke Huan* was the son of Duke Xiang of Qi. The Lord of Yu prized treasures, and Jin lured him with jade and horses—*lured* means to entice. The King of the Hu loved music, and Duke Mu of Qin seduced him with female musicians—*seduced* means to bewitch. All were thus controlled by others through profit—*controlled* means to be seized.

Thus, what is well established cannot be uprooted—this speaks of establishing the formless. Fire is hot, yet water extinguishes it; metal is hard, yet fire melts it; wood is strong, yet the axe fells it; water flows, yet earth dams it. Only the Creator, in its transformations, cannot be overcome by things.

Thus, when inner desires do not leak out, it is called *sealed*; when external evils do not enter, it is called *blocked*. With inner sealing and outer blocking, what affair will not be moderated? With outer blocking and inner sealing, what affair will not be accomplished?

Only after not employing can one truly employ; only after not acting can one truly act. When the spirit is wearied, it scatters—*scatters* means to dissipate. When the ears and eyes are indulged, they are exhausted—*exhausted* means to perish.

Thus, the ruler who embodies the Dao extinguishes thoughts and dispels intentions, awaiting all with clarity and emptiness. He does not boast of his words, nor seize others’ affairs. He follows names to demand realities, allows them to govern themselves, entrusts without instructing, holds accountable without teaching. To regard not-knowing as the Dao—the Dao is always unknown.

The treasure lies in "what can be done about it?"
The Dao values formlessness—what is formless cannot be "done about," which is why the Dao is prized.

Thus, the affairs of the hundred officials each have their proper guardianship. To have proper guardianship is to say one does not depart from sealing. Grasping the handle of power and authority, transforming the people becomes easy.

When Duke Chu of Wei was enslaved on the road, it was because his authority was weighty. Duke Chu refers to Duke Chu of Wei. When Dukes Jing and Huan had Guan and Yan as ministers, it was because their positions were exalted. Guan Zhong served as minister to Duke Huan, and Yan Ying served Duke Jing—this was due to the exalted positions of the two rulers.

The cowardly overpower the brave, and the foolish control the wise—this is because what they rely upon in terms of power prevails. Thus, branches cannot exceed the trunk in size, nor can the ends surpass the root in strength, so that light and heavy, small and large, restrain one another.

Like the five fingers belonging to the arm, grasping, seizing, and snatching—all proceed as desired, for the small is subsumed under the great. Therefore, those who gain the advantage of power hold very little, yet preserve much; what they guard is minimal—*minimal* means essential, few—yet what they control is vast.

Thus, a tree ten spans in girth supports a house of a thousand jun, and a five-inch bolt governs opening and closing. Is this because the size of the material itself suffices? It is because of the essential position it occupies.

Confucius and Mo Di cultivated the arts of the former sages, mastering the discourses of the Six Arts. Their mouths proclaimed their words, their bodies enacted their aspirations, and they admired virtue and followed the transformative influence—*feng* meaning transformation. Yet those who served and labored for them numbered no more than a few dozen—*yi* meaning service. Had they occupied the Son of Heaven’s throne, the world entire would have become Confucians and Mohists. *Bian* means "all."

King Zhuang of Chu mourned the death of Wen Wuwei in Song, and in a surge of fury, he swept his sleeves and crossed the border. Armored ranks stretched unbroken along the roads, and his army encamped beneath Song’s walls—such was the weight of his authority. King Zhuang was the son of King Mu of Chu, Lü. He had sent Shen Hang to pay a state visit to Qi without requesting passage through Song. Wuwei said, "They may not necessarily ambush and kill me." The king replied, "If they kill you, we will attack Song." Wuwei set out wearing his ceremonial cap, refusing to request passage through Song. Hua Yuan said, "To pass through our land without requesting passage is to treat us with contempt—*bi* meaning to reduce us to nothing. If we use force to kill their envoy, we too will be destroyed." Thus they killed him. When King Zhuang heard this, he was enraged, and with a sweep of his sleeve he rose and encamped his army outside Song’s walls. Hence it is said: the weight of authority.

King Wen of Chu favored wearing the *xiezhi* cap, and the state of Chu imitated him. King Wen was the son of King Wu of Chu, Xiong Da, named Bi. The *xiezhi* cap later became the standard headwear for imperial censors. King Wuling of Zhao wore a cowrie-shell belt and *shundiao* sash to court, and the state of Zhao followed suit. King Wuling lived after the Spring and Autumn period; he adorned his belt with large cowrie shells and adopted Hu-style dress. *Shundiao* is read as *sipitou*; it is also called *guoluo* belt, with *weibei* and *gao* as its ornaments. Had he been a commoner in coarse cloth, wearing the *xiezhi* cap, cowrie-shell belt, and *shundiao* sash to court, he would not have escaped ridicule. *Shundiao* is read as *sipitou*, a character with three pronunciations.

That the people’s love of goodness and delight in uprightness should spontaneously conform to the law without prohibition or punishment is something that occurs not once in ten thousand cases. But when the commands issued below are such that compliance brings benefit and defiance brings misfortune, before the shadow of the sun has shifted, there is none within the seas who does not submit to the standard—*sheng* meaning "to correct."

Thus, grasping the blade of a sword to prevent Beigongzi and Sima Kuai Kui from engaging the enemy—Beigongzi was a man of Qi, the one Mencius called Beigong You. Sima Kuai Kui was descended from Cheng Bo Xiu Fu, whom King Xuan appointed as Minister of War, thus founding the Sima clan; Kuai Kui was his descendant. When the Zhou declined, he went to another state. Kuai Kui was in Yue, renowned for his skill in swordplay. *Ying* means "to strike." But if one holds the hilt and raises the tip, even an ordinary man can control victory. *Gu* refers to the sword’s hilt; *zhao* means "to raise."

Now, if Wu Huo and Jie Fan were to pull an ox backward by its tail, the tail would break and the ox would not follow—this is resistance. Wu Huo and Jie Fan were both men of great strength. But if one threads a mulberry twig through its nose, even a child of five *chi* can lead it to circle the four seas—this is compliance. That a seven-*chi* oar controls the movement of a boat to port and starboard is because it relies on water—*nao* refers to the oar; *zi* means "to use." *Nao* is read as in "vexation." When the Son of Heaven issues commands, orders are carried out and prohibitions observed, for he relies on the power of the multitude.

To remove what harms the people and open what benefits them is to exercise authority—like breaching a salt flat to release a reservoir. *Jian* refers to alkaline soil; *tang* means "dike." Both are used to store water. Thus, following the current downstream makes arrival easy, and sailing with the wind makes distance effortless. This is to rely on the natural tendency.

When Duke Huan established governance, he removed beasts that devoured flesh, birds that consumed grain, and nets that trapped game—three measures that delighted the hundred clans. King Zhou killed Prince Bigan, and his kin turned against him; he hacked the shins of those who waded through the morning frost, and the myriad people rebelled. Two measures, and the world was lost. Thus, virtue does not require benefiting all the people under heaven; benefiting one person, and the world follows the transformative influence. Tyranny does not require harming all within the seas; harming one person, and the world turns away in rebellion.

Thus, Duke Huan implemented three measures and nine times convened the feudal lords; King Zhou took two actions and could not even remain a commoner. Therefore, the deployment of measures cannot but be carefully considered. The three measures were removing beasts that devoured flesh, birds that consumed grain, and nets that trapped game. The two actions were killing Bigan and hacking the shins of those who waded through the frost.

When the ruler levies taxes on the people, he must first calculate the year’s harvest, assess the people’s stores, and know the surplus and deficit in times of famine and plenty. Only then does he take chariots, clothing, and food to satisfy his desires. Lofty towers and layered pavilions, connected halls and linked galleries—though not lacking in splendor—yet if the people have no dugouts or narrow huts to shelter their bodies, the enlightened ruler does not delight in them. He does not delight in their grand splendor. Rich wines and sweet delicacies—though not lacking in flavor—yet if the people have chaff, husks, beans, and coarse grain that do not reach their mouths, then the enlightened ruler does not savor them. He does not savor their rich flavors. A curved couch and fine mat—though not lacking in comfort—*kuang* means "secure"; *ruo* means "fine." Yet if the people dwell on the frontier, face peril and hardship, and die exposed with their bones unburied, the enlightened ruler does not rest easy. He does not rest easy on his curved couch and fine mat.

Thus, the rulers of antiquity who governed the people grieved for them with deep sorrow. When the state suffered famine, they did not partake of double flavors; when the people were cold, they did not don furs in winter, sharing their cold and hunger. Only when the year’s harvest was abundant and the people prosperous did they begin to hang bells and drums, display shields and axes, and ascend the hall—*deng* means "to complete," referring to a bountiful year. Ruler and ministers, high and low, rejoiced together, and there were none in the state who mourned. This means all were joyful.

Thus, the ancient use of metal and stone instruments, pipes and strings was to express joy—metal refers to bells, stone to chimes, pipes to flutes, and strings to zithers and lutes. Weapons, armor, axes, and halberds served to display wrath. Goblets, ladles, sacrificial vessels, and the rites of toasting and reciprocation were means to manifest goodness—*xiao* means "to convey." Mourning garments, hempen sandals, wailing, and lamentation served to convey sorrow—*lun* means "to make clear." All these arise from fullness within and take form without—*chong* means "substance."

Yet when a disordered ruler seizes from the people, he does not measure their strength—*zai* means "to gauge." When he demands from below, he does not consider their stores. Men and women cannot attend to the work of plowing and weaving to meet the ruler’s demands—*shi* means "to manage," and *ye* means "occupation." Their strength is exhausted, their resources depleted, and ruler and ministers grow mutually resentful. Thus, the people come to parched lips and boiling livers, living from day to day with no reserves—having food for today but no store for tomorrow. Yet only then do they begin to strike great bells, beat resounding drums, blow reed pipes and panpipes, and pluck zithers and lutes. This is like donning armor to enter the ancestral temple or wearing silk brocade to join the army—it loses the very source from which joy arises.

Now, the livelihood of the people: one man treads the plow, yet cultivates no more than ten *mu*. The yield of average land, the harvest of a full year, does not exceed four *shi* per *mu*. His wife and children, the old and weak, depend on this for sustenance. Yet there are also the calamities of floods and droughts—*cen* means prolonged waterlogging. And there are the demands of the ruler’s taxes, the costs of chariots, horses, weapons, and armor. Seen thus, human life is pitiable—*min* means "grieved, without joy."

The vastness of Heaven and Earth: if one calculates three years of plowing, there remains one year’s food in reserve. On average, nine years yield three years’ surplus, eighteen years six years’ accumulation—*ji* means "store." Twenty-seven years yield nine years’ provision. Even with the misfortunes of floods and droughts, the people do not fall into destitution or flee as refugees. Thus, a state without nine years’ surplus is called "insufficient"; without six years’ accumulation, "distressed"—*min* means "grieved," and *bing* means "urgent." Without three years’ surplus, it is called "impoverished."

Therefore, when there are humane rulers and enlightened lords, their taking from below is measured, their self-sustenance restrained. Then they receive the bounty of Heaven and Earth and do not suffer the miseries of hunger and cold. But if there are greedy and violent rulers who harass those below, plundering the people to satisfy endless desires, then the hundred clans cannot partake of Heaven’s harmony or tread upon Earth’s virtue—*tianhe* means "qi," and *dide* means "what Earth produces." Food is the root of the people. The people are the root of the state. The state is the root of the ruler.

Thus, the lord of men follows the seasons of Heaven above, exhausts the resources of Earth below, and employs human labor in between. Thereby, all living things flourish and grow, and the five grains multiply. He teaches the people to raise the six livestock, to plant trees in season, to diligently cultivate the fields, and to propagate mulberry and hemp. He enriches both fertile and barren land, high and low, each according to its suitability. On hills, slopes, and perilous terrain where the five grains do not grow, he plants bamboo and trees. In spring, he fells the withered and dead; in summer, he gathers fruits and melons—those with pits are called *guo*, those without, *luo*. In autumn, he stores vegetables and grains—vegetables are called *shu*, grains *shi*. In winter, he cuts firewood and kindling—large pieces are called *xin*, small ones *zheng*—to serve as the people’s resources—*zi* means "use."

Thus, the living lack nothing for their use, and the dead are not abandoned as corpses. *Zhuan* means "to discard."

Therefore, the laws of the former kings stipulated:
- In hunting, one must not trap entire herds. *Yan* means "to exhaust."
- One must not take fawns or young deer. The young of deer are called *mi*, and the young of *mi* are called *yao*.
- One must not drain marshes to fish. *Zhengze* means to dry up ponds.
- One must not burn forests to hunt.

All these measures serve to preserve all things.

Before the *chai* has performed its ritual of offering beasts, snares and nets may not be set in the wild. In the tenth month, the *chai* kills beasts and arranges them on all sides—this is called the "ritual of offering beasts." Before this ritual, snares and nets may not be set.

Before the otter has performed its ritual of offering fish, fishing nets may not enter the water. The *Ming Tang Yue Ling* states: "In the first month of spring, the otter offers fish." The otter catches carp and arranges them on all sides by the water—this is called the "ritual of offering fish." Before this ritual, fishing is not permitted.

Before the hawk has grasped its prey in the autumn, nets may not be spread in valleys and gorges. After the start of autumn, hawks grasp their prey; before this time, nets may not be set. *Jun* is sometimes written as *juan*.

Before plants and trees have shed their leaves, axes may not enter the mountain forests. In the ninth month, plants and trees begin to shed; before this time, mountain forests may not be felled.

Before insects have hibernated, fire may not be used to burn fields. In the tenth month, hibernating insects are fully concealed; before this time, burning fields is not permitted.

Pregnant creatures may not be killed; eggs may not be taken; fish shorter than a foot may not be caught; pigs less than a year old may not be eaten. All these measures serve to preserve all things.

Thus, the sprouting of plants and trees resembles rising qi; creatures gather to them like flowing springs; flying birds flock to them like clouds and mist—there is a reason they are drawn to them.

Therefore, the governance of the former kings stipulated:
- When clouds gather from the four seas, borders and boundaries are repaired. This occurs after the start of spring, when clouds emerge from the four seas.
- When frogs croak and swallows descend, roads are cleared and maintained. This occurs in the third month.
- When yin descends to the hundred springs, bridges and beams are repaired. This occurs in the tenth month.
- When the *Zhang* constellation appears at dusk, grains are sown. In the third month at dusk, the *Zhang* star culminates in the south. *Zhang* is a constellation of the Vermilion Bird in the south.
- When the Great Fire culminates, millet and beans are planted. The Great Fire is a constellation of the Azure Dragon in the east; in the fourth month, when the *si* branch culminates, it appears in the south. *Shu* means "beans."
- When the *Xu* constellation culminates, winter crops are sown. *Xu* is a constellation of the Dark Warrior in the north; in the eighth month, when the *you* branch culminates, it appears in the south.
- When the *Mao* constellation culminates, stores are gathered, and firewood is cut. The *Mao* constellation is the White Tiger in the west. In the last month of autumn, stores are gathered.

The former kings announced these measures to Heaven above and disseminated them to the people below. This was how they responded to the seasons, prepared accordingly, enriched the state, and benefited the people, filling the present and securing the future—their Way was complete.

*Shi* means "full," and *kuang* means "empty." They did not personally see and walk these paths; they desired to benefit the people. If the desire to benefit the people is never forgotten, governance naturally becomes complete.

The heart’s relation to the nine orifices and four limbs is such that it does not directly manage any single task, yet in movement and stillness, hearing and seeing, it serves as their master—this is because it never forgets the desire to benefit.

Thus, when Yao acted with virtue, all virtues came to him; when Jie acted with wickedness, all wickedness gathered around him. The accumulation of virtue leads to the completion of merit; the accumulation of wickedness leads to the utmost calamity. *Ji* means "utmost."

In general, people’s judgments should be:
- The heart should be small, while the aspirations should be great.
- Wisdom should be round, while conduct should be square.
- Abilities should be many, while affairs should be few.

The reason the heart should be small is to anticipate disasters before they arise, prepare for misfortunes before they occur, guard against faults, and be cautious of the minute, never indulging one’s desires. As the *Book of Songs* says: "It was this King Wen, watchful and reverent, brightly serving the Supreme God, who received abundant blessings." This expresses the same idea.

The reason aspirations should be great is to encompass all states, unify diverse customs, and shelter the hundred clans as if they were one family, with right and wrong converging like spokes toward the hub. The hub is an analogy for the king.

The reason wisdom should be round is that it revolves and circulates without beginning or end, like a seamless ring. It flows in all directions, deep and inexhaustible like a spring, so that the myriad things arise, and none fail to respond. *Ying* means "to harmonize."

The reason conduct should be square is to stand upright without bending. *Nao* means "weak and crooked." It remains pure and unstained; in poverty, it does not change its principles; in success, it does not indulge its will. *Si* means "to indulge."

The reason abilities should be many is to possess both civil and martial skills, to act and rest in accordance with propriety, to undertake or abandon tasks appropriately, to achieve what is fitting in every detail, to avoid conflict, and to ensure nothing is left undone. *Ji* means "to strike," and *li* means "to break."

The reason affairs should be few is to grasp the handle and hold to the method, to seize the essentials to respond to the many, to hold to simplicity to govern the vast, to abide in stillness and maintain the center, to revolve around the pivot, to unify the myriad things as if matching tally tokens. *Fu* means "tally."

Thus, a small heart forbids even the minute; great aspirations embrace all without exception. Rounded wisdom knows no ignorance; square conduct refrains from what is not upright. Many abilities leave nothing untended—*zhi* means "to act." Few affairs mean holding to essentials. *Yue* means "essential."

In ancient times, when the Son of Heaven held court, the dukes and ministers offered forthright admonitions, scholars recited the *Book of Songs*, blind musicians recited admonitions, the common people transmitted their words, historians recorded his faults, and stewards removed his meals. Yet they still considered this insufficient, so:
- Yao set up a drum for those who dared to admonish—those who wished to offer counsel would strike the drum.
- Shun erected a pillar for criticism, where people could write their praise or blame on the wooden board.
- Tang appointed officials of integrity—*Sizhi* was an office name, meaning "not crooked."
- King Wu established a rattle-drum for caution—when he wished to caution the ruler about doubtful matters, he would shake the rattle-drum.

Even the slightest error, once it occurred, was prepared for. *Bei* means "to prepare."

The sage, in matters of virtue, leaves nothing small undone—*ju* means "to employ." In matters of fault, he leaves nothing minute uncorrected. *Gai* means "to change."

Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu all ruled the world with serene composure, facing south to hold court. With their backs to the screen, they received the feudal lords. In those times, they dined to the sound of the great war drum—*gaogu*, the music of the Son of Heaven’s meals. As the *Book of Songs* says, *"The drums and bells resound, the chimes are struck."* They performed the *"Yong"* after the meal—*"Yong"* being the music played when the feast was concluded. After eating, they offered sacrifice to the stove god, yet employed no shamans or invokers, for their virtue was complete and their conduct upright, seeking nothing from the spirits. Neither ghosts nor gods dared bring misfortune, nor mountains and rivers inflict calamity—such was their supreme nobility. Thus is the loftiness of perfect virtue. Yet they trembled with caution, growing more vigilant with each passing day. From this, we see that the hearts of sages are small indeed. As the *Book of Songs* says, *"Only this King Wen, reverent and cautious, served the Supreme God with brilliance, ever mindful of abundant blessings."* This describes him well.

When King Wu overthrew Zhou, he distributed the grain from Juqiao—*Juqiao* being the name of Zhou’s granary (another account says it was the bridge at Julu for transporting grain)—and scattered the wealth stored in Lutai—*Lutai* being the treasury where Zhou amassed his riches. King Wu dispersed these to relieve the suffering people. He restored the tomb of Bi Gan—Bi Gan being an uncle of Zhou who had remonstrated against his wrongdoing, only to be killed by Zhou—thus honoring his grave to commend his benevolence. He marked the lane of Shang Rong—Shang Rong being a worthy man of Yin and the teacher of Laozi, hence he exalted his neighborhood. The *Mu Cheng* chapter also states, *"Laozi studied under Shang Rong and, seeing his tongue, understood the virtue of softness."* He paid homage at the temple of Cheng Tang—Cheng Tang being the founding king of Yin, for sages honor those of their own kind. He freed Ji Zi from imprisonment—Ji Zi being a half-brother of Zhou. As the *Analects* says, *"Ji Zi was made a slave."* When King Wu overthrew Zhou, he released Ji Zi from captivity, consulted him on the *Great Plan*, and enfeoffed him in Chaoxian. He allowed each to dwell in their homes and till their fields, neither altering the old nor establishing the new, befriending only the worthy. Though he used what was not his and employed those who were not his subjects, all remained as tranquil as if it had always been so. From this, we see that the aspirations of sages are vast indeed.

King Wen surveyed the successes and failures of the world, examining right and wrong in all things. The reasons for the prosperity of Yao and Shun and the downfall of Jie and Zhou were all depicted in the Bright Hall—*depicted* meaning "illustrated." Thus, his wisdom was broad and his knowledge vast, enabling him to respond without limitation. From this, we see that the wisdom of sages is all-encompassing.

Kings Cheng and Kang inherited the legacy of Wen and Wu, upholding the institutions of the Bright Hall. They observed the traces of survival and ruin, witnessed the transformations of success and failure, spoke only of the Dao, and dared not utter what was not the intent of the sages. They acted only in accordance with righteousness, never presuming to follow what was not benevolent and just. Their words were never carelessly spoken, their actions never carelessly performed; they chose the good and only then proceeded. From this, we see that the conduct of sages is square and true.

Confucius’s understanding surpassed that of Chang Hong in wisdom, and his courage equaled that of Meng Ben. His feet could tread upon the wild hare, and his strength could lift the city gate’s bolt—his abilities were indeed many. Chang Hong was a grandee of Zhou, a minister to King Jing, renowned for his knowledge of the great Dao. Meng Ben was a warrior of great valor, yet Confucius matched him in ability. *Lift* means "to raise"; with one hand, he could grasp the bolt of a city gate and lift it. Thus it is said his abilities were many. Yet his bravery and strength went unnoticed, for none heard of him as a man of valor or might. His skills and craftsmanship were unknown, for none recognized him as one possessing such talents. He devoted himself solely to the practice of filial piety, thereby becoming the Uncrowned King—his achievements were few indeed.

Over the two hundred and forty-two years of the *Spring and Autumn* period, fifty-two states perished, and thirty-six rulers were assassinated. He culled the good and eradicated the wicked, thereby establishing the kingly Way—his judgments were indeed vast. Yet when besieged in Kuang, his countenance remained unchanged, and his zither playing and singing never ceased. Kuang was a town in Song (now the Kuang Pavilion west of Chenxiang County). Confucius said, *"Heaven has endowed me with virtue—what can the people of Kuang do to me?"* Thus his expression did not alter, and his music did not stop. Facing the brink of death, encountering peril and hardship, he adhered to righteousness and principle, and his resolve was never shaken—his discernment was clear indeed. *Encountered* means "to face," and *shaken* means "to fear."

Yet when he served as Minister of Justice in Lu, his judgments were invariably decisive—this was during his tenure as Minister of Justice under Duke Ding of Lu. In compiling the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he made no mention of ghosts or spirits and dared not assert his own authority.

The wisdom of the sage is indeed vast, yet what he upholds is simple; thus his actions invariably bring honor. The wisdom of the foolish is indeed meager, yet what they pursue is manifold; thus their movements invariably lead to ruin. Wu Qi and Zhang Yi, though their intelligence fell short of Confucius and Mozi, contended for the favor of rulers of ten-thousand-chariot states—this is why they were torn apart limb from limb.

Those who govern through upright instruction find it easy and invariably succeed; those who manipulate the world through deceit and cunning find it difficult and invariably fail. For anyone who seeks to establish conduct and set a course in the world, to abandon what is easy and certain to succeed in favor of what is difficult and bound to fail is the result of folly and delusion. These six contradictions must not go unexamined.

The six contradictions refer to Confucius, Mozi, Chang Hong, Meng Ben, Wu Qi, and Zhang Yi. Their conduct was mutually opposed, hence they are called the "six contradictions." To possess knowledge of the myriad things yet lack understanding of the human Way cannot be called wisdom. To cherish all living beings yet not love humankind cannot be called benevolence.

Benevolence means loving one’s kind; wisdom means being free from delusion. The benevolent, even amid severance and division, reveal in their countenance what they cannot bear. The wise, even in the most intricate and trying matters, display in their actions what they do not obscure.

By turning inward to reflect on one’s own feelings, what one desires for oneself is not imposed upon others. From the near, one knows the far; from oneself, one knows others—this is how human wisdom converges in action. A small teaching brings great preservation; a minor punishment brings great peace. Small teachings in rectitude ensure great preservation; slight admonishments in righteousness secure great tranquility. Without rectitude, there is no preservation; without righteousness, there is no peace.

Only through compassion and extension of one’s feelings can this be put into practice—this is what the wise alone decide. Thus benevolence and wisdom intersect, sometimes converging, sometimes diverging. When they converge, it is rectitude; when they diverge, it is expediency—their principle is one.

Officials uphold the law; the noble man establishes righteousness. To follow the law without righteousness is merely to be an official, insufficient for governance.

Farming is laborious work; weaving is toilsome. That people do not abandon these toilsome and laborious tasks is because they know they provide clothing and food. Human nature cannot do without clothing and food, and the way to clothing and food must begin with plowing and weaving—this is evident to all the people.

Matters like plowing and weaving, though initially arduous, ultimately benefit the many. The foolish see little of this; the matters that can be weighed are many, yet the foolish weigh few—this is why the foolish encounter many misfortunes. The wise prepare for all that can be prepared; they weigh all that can be weighed—this is why the wise encounter few misfortunes.

Thus the wise first oppose and later align; *oppose* means to go against. The foolish begin with joy and end in sorrow. To ask, "What brings honor today, and what brings righteousness tomorrow?" is easy to answer. To ask, "What brings righteousness today, and what brings honor tomorrow?" is difficult to know.

A blind musician was asked, "What is white silk like?" He replied, "It is bright." "What is black like?" He said, "It is dark." When white and black were placed before him, he could not distinguish them. People see white and black with their eyes and speak of them with their mouths. The blind musician could speak of white and black but could not know them—thus his words about white and black were the same as others’, but his ability to distinguish them differed.

To be filial toward one’s parents at home and loyal to one’s lord abroad—all, whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, know this to be righteousness. Yet few can expound on loyalty and filial piety and know their origins.

In all human deliberation, none proceed without first deeming something acceptable and then acting upon it. Whether it is right or wrong—this is how the foolish and the wise differ.

Of all human nature, nothing is more precious than benevolence, nothing more urgent than wisdom. Benevolence is the essence; wisdom is the means to practice it. These two are the foundation, and when augmented with courage, strength, eloquence, quick-wittedness, agility, diligence, skill, sensitivity, acuity, and discernment, they encompass all benefits.

If one’s person is not cultivated and one’s skills and arts are fully prepared, yet one lacks benevolence and wisdom as the trunk and branches, and instead piles on many adornments, it only increases one’s detriment. Thus one who is without benevolence yet possesses courage and daring will act recklessly and wield a sharp sword; *recklessly* means to act in disorder. One who is without wisdom yet is eloquent and quick-witted will abandon the swift steed and not take it as a model. The unwise, though eloquent and quick-witted, do not know how to judge—like discarding a horse and not knowing where to go. *Quick-witted* means to be cunning.

Even with talents and abilities, if their application is inappropriate and their placement unsuitable, they merely serve to aid falsehood and embellish wrongdoing. Thus many skills are not as good as few. Therefore, those with wild ambitions must not be lent advantageous circumstances; *wild* means external. Those with foolish natures must not be given sharp instruments. Laozi said, "The sharp instruments of the state must not be lent to others."

Fish delight in swimming when they have water; when the pond breaks and the water dries up, they are eaten by ants. If one is in charge of maintaining the dikes and repairing the breaches, the fish benefit. *In charge* means to preside. The state has what sustains it; people have what enables them to live. When the state has those who sustain it, the ruler is like a fish in water. The state is prosperous, thus the people thrive.

What sustains the state is benevolence and righteousness; what enables people to live is practicing goodness. A state without righteousness, though great, must perish—Jie and Zhou are examples. A person without good intentions, though brave, must be harmed. The *Analects* says, "One who is brave yet lacks propriety causes disorder; disorder leads to harm." In governing the state, those above must not interfere...

To prevent the dangers of collapse and harm is the art of those above. Being filial to parents, respectful to elder brothers and sisters-in-law, and trustworthy to friends—these need not await commands from above to be practiced. To abandon what one can do and demand what one cannot control is perverse.

When a scholar dwells in lowliness and obscurity yet wishes to rise, they must first turn inward. There is a Way to rise above: if one’s reputation does not arise, they cannot ascend. There is a Way to gain renown: if one is not trusted by friends, they cannot attain it. There is a Way to be trusted by friends: if one does not please their parents, they will not be trusted. If one cannot please their parents, friends will turn and distrust them.

There is a Way to please one’s parents: if one’s cultivation of the self is not sincere, they cannot serve their parents. There is a Way to sincerity in the self: if the heart is not single-minded, one cannot achieve wholehearted sincerity. The Way lies in what is easy, yet people seek it in what is difficult. "Easy" means turning inward and first cultivating the root. Without cultivating the root, yet desiring the reputation of pleasing parents and sincerity in the self—all these are difficult. Thus it is said, "The Way lies in what is easy, yet people seek it in what is difficult."

Proof lies near, yet people seek it far—hence they do not attain it. "Proof" means verification; "near" refers to the root, "far" to the branches. Thus they cannot attain it.

The "Miu Cheng Xun" – Erroneous and divergent theories borrow from things and categories, aligning them with the divine and luminous to discern what is precious.

The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. It is level as a carpenter’s square, straight as a marking line, round as a compass, square as a ruler. It enfolds the cosmos without outer or inner, penetrating and uniting heaven and earth without obstruction. *Obstruction* means entanglement.

Thus, those who embody the Dao are neither sorrowful nor joyful, neither pleased nor angered. When they sit, they are without anxiety; when they sleep, they are without dreams. Things come, and they are named; affairs come, and they respond.

The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is ordered, the hundred joints are all at peace; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred joints are all in chaos. Therefore, when the heart is ordered, the limbs forget one another; when the state is ordered, ruler and ministers forget one another.

The Yellow Emperor said: "Vast and obscure, following the Dao of Heaven, sharing the same qi as the primordial." Thus, those of utmost virtue speak with shared brevity, act with shared purpose. Above and below are of one mind, without divergent paths or peripheral distractions. They bar the way to depravity and secure the path to goodness, and the people turn toward the proper direction.

Thus, the *Yi* says: "Gathering people in the wilds, it is favorable to cross the great river." This means that if one can unite people in the Dao to the point of the wilds, one can then ford the great river. The *great river* is a great difficulty.

The Dao is that by which things are guided; virtue is that by which nature is upheld. Benevolence is the visible evidence of accumulated kindness; righteousness is that which accords with the human heart and suits the many. Thus, when the Dao vanishes, virtue is employed; when virtue declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.

In the age of high antiquity, people embodied the Dao and did not rely on virtue. In the middle age, they preserved virtue and did not corrupt it. In the degenerate age, they cling tenaciously, fearing only the loss of benevolence and righteousness.

The noble person cannot live without benevolence and righteousness; to lose them is to lose that by which one lives. The petty person cannot live without desires; to lose them is to lose that by which one survives. Thus, the noble person fears losing benevolence and righteousness, while the petty person fears losing profit. Observing what they fear, one knows their differences.

The *Yi* says: "Pursuing the deer without a guide, one only enters the forest. The noble person nearly does not abandon it, but to proceed brings regret." *Pursuing* means to follow; the *deer* is a metaphor for the people. *Guide* means deception. *Nearly* means ultimately. To deceive the people and lead them into the forest is ultimately not as good as abandoning the pursuit, lest they fail to reach the end and bring regret upon themselves.

Those who bestow generously receive beautiful recompense; those who harbor great resentment suffer deep misfortune. To give little yet expect much, to accumulate resentment yet hope for no calamity—such things have never existed from ancient times to the present.

Thus, the sage examines what has gone before and knows what will come after. Is the Dao of the sage like placing a wine vessel in the middle of a crossroads? *Crossroads* refers to the six directions being open. *Vessel* is a wine container. Passersby pour and drink, each receiving what is fitting.

Thus, to win over one person is to win over a hundred. If one person comes and their heart is won, then a hundred will come, and their hearts will also be won. When one gives to those below what one desires from above, who would not bear it? When one serves those above with what one desires from below, who would not rejoice?

The *Poetry* says: "Charming this one person, responding to the lords with careful virtue." Virtue is great, the one person is small—yet if one can perfect the small, one can perfect the great.

The noble person, seeing faults, forgets punishment and thus can admonish. Seeing worthiness, forgets lowliness and thus can yield. Seeing insufficiency, forgets poverty and thus can give. Emotions reside within, and conduct takes shape without. All conduct that carries emotion, though it may err, incurs no resentment; conduct that does not carry emotion, though loyal, invites dislike. *Carry* means what the heart feels; *emotion* means sincerity.

Hou Ji brought great benefit to the world yet did not boast of himself. Yu had no abandoned achievements, no concealed wealth, and viewed himself as ever unsatisfied. *Unsatisfied* means not full; *full* is like sinking, and *sinking* means deficiency. *Substantial yet empty*—this is the perfection of it.

People all esteem what they love and love what pleases them. The world does not fail to elevate the worthy, yet some use them to bring order, others to bring chaos. It is not that the worthy hide themselves—*hide* means deception—but that people seek those who are the same as themselves. If one has not necessarily obtained the worthy yet seeks those who are the same as oneself, desiring to obtain the worthy is also far from likely.

If Yao were to assess Shun, it would be fitting; if Jie were to assess Yao, it would be like using a pint measure for a stone. Now, to call something a fox-raccoon is to certainly not know the fox, nor the raccoon. If one does not know these two beasts, it is not that one has never seen a fox, nor that one has never seen a raccoon. Fox and raccoon are not different—they are of the same kind—yet to call them a fox-raccoon is to not know fox or raccoon.

Thus, to call the unworthy worthy is certainly not to know the worthy; to call the worthy unworthy is certainly not to know the unworthy.

When the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, the people long for his intent. When the petty person is in high position, it is like sleeping on a crossbar or drying silk floss—*sleeping* means lying on a crossbar, restless; *floss* is cocoon silk. To dry cocoon silk is to toss and turn without cease until death. One cannot have a moment’s peace.

Thus, the *Yi* says: "Mounting a horse, disarrayed, weeping blood in unbroken streams." This means that mounting a horse in disarray is difficult, hence the sorrow of weeping blood. It speaks of the petty person occupying a position not his own—it cannot last long.

Nothing exists without some use. Heavenly male and aconite are violently poisonous medicines, yet good physicians use them to save lives. Dwarves and blind musicians are people in dire straits—*dire* means stumbling, or *extreme*—yet the ruler employs them for entertainment.

Thus, the sage regulates and employs all materials, leaving nothing unused. *Regulates* means to prune and reduce. A brave warrior shouts once, and the three armies all retreat—his issuance is sincere.

Thus, if one sings and none harmonize, if one laments and none echo—*lament* means a grieving sound; *echo* means sighing—there must be something in their hearts that does not align.

Therefore, Shun did not rise from his mat yet ruled the world because he sought it within himself.

Thus, when superiors are full of pretexts, the people abound in deceit.

That a body bent should cast a straight shadow—this has never been heard of.

Where persuasion does not reach, demeanor does. The coarse in persuasion cannot compare to the subtlety of demeanor, which penetrates deeply into others.

Where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does. Stirring the heart, illuminating wisdom, issuing forth to take form—this is the utmost refinement.

One may engage through posture and power, but cannot mirror another’s will.

The horses of the Rong and Di peoples can all be ridden, whether near or far, yet only Zaofu could exhaust their strength. The people of Sanmiao could all be made loyal and trustworthy, whether worthy or unworthy, yet only Yao and Shun could equalize their excellence—there must be something untransmittable.

The subtlety of heart-teaching cannot be transmitted.

Zhonghang Moubo wrestled tigers with his bare hands—Zhonghang Moubo was a minister of Jin, strong enough to grapple living tigers—yet could not keep them alive. His strength could kill tigers, but his virtue could not subdue them. For his might was superior, but his power fell short. *Power* here means *capacity*.

Employing what a hundred men can do yields the strength of a hundred men. Enacting what a thousand men love wins the hearts of a thousand men. It is like felling a tree by pulling its root—then the thousand branches and ten thousand leaves have no choice but to follow.

A loving father’s affection is not for the sake of repayment; it cannot be inwardly dissolved. The sage-king’s nurturing of the people is not to seek their service—it is a nature that cannot be restrained. Like fire’s spontaneous heat, like ice’s spontaneous cold, what cultivation is needed?

Yet those who rely on their strength and depend on their achievements are like men on a burning boat. The people in the boat unite to extinguish the fire, not *bestowing* favors upon one another.

Thus, the noble person, seeing the beginning, knows the end.

Matchmakers praise others, yet none feel gratitude toward them. Hiring a laborer and forcing him to eat—none feel affection for this. Even a loving father and a kind mother cannot surpass this: if there is an ulterior motive, kindness does not connect.

Therefore, sending off the departed is not for the sake of welcoming the coming. Bestowing upon the dead is not solely for the living.

Sincerity issuing from oneself moves what is distant.

Brocade and embroidery enter the ancestral temple—this honors ornamentation. *Enter* means *to bring in*. Jade tablets and scepters stand before one—this upholds substance. To sacrifice with jade is to honor substance.

When ornamentation does not surpass substance, this is called the noble person.

Thus, one may spend a whole year making a carriage, but without a three-inch linchpin, it cannot be driven. A carpenter may hew a door, but without a one-foot bolt, it cannot be secured.

Therefore, the noble person may be constrained in what he binds. *Bind* means *to conclude*.

The essence of the heart can spiritually transform, but cannot instruct others. *Instruct* means *to teach*.

The essence of the eye can dissolve and moisten, but cannot reveal taboos. *Reveal* means *to expose*. *Taboos* means *sincerity*—it cannot be used to teach and warn others.

Within the state of primordial obscurity, it cannot be explained to others. *Primordial obscurity* refers to the human heart.

Thus, Shun did not rise from his mat yet governed the world; Jie did not descend the steps yet threw the world into chaos—his emotions were more clamorous than shouts. For though shouts and grand words are loud, they do not compare to the sincerity of heart and conduct.

To lack something in oneself yet demand it of others—this has never been heard of in ancient or modern times.

When words are the same and the people trust, trust lies before the words. When commands are the same and the people are transformed, sincerity lies beyond the commands.

When the sage is above, the people shift and are transformed, for emotion precedes them.

When one acts above yet receives no response below, emotion and command are at odds.

Thus, the *Yi* says: "The dragon soars to its limit and has regrets." A benevolent ruler’s actions reach their extreme above, hence the regrets.

A three-month-old infant knows nothing of benefit or harm, yet a loving mother’s affection is understood—this is emotion.

Thus, the use of words is small and bright. The use of silence is vast and boundless.

Embodying the noble person’s words is trust. *Embodying the noble person’s* means *to enact the noble person’s words*. Aligning with the noble person’s intent is loyalty.

Loyalty and trust take form within and stir responses without.

Thus, Yu grasped shield and battle-axe and danced between the two steps, and the Sanmiao submitted. The Sanmiao had rebelled against Yu, but Yu subdued them with ritual and music.

When the hawk soars over the river, fish and turtles sink. Yu subdued the Sanmiao with virtue, just as the hawk soaring over the river causes fish and turtles to fear and hide. Birds take flight—seeing the hawk, they flee to avoid harm. For the hawk harbors a desire to harm, so birds and fish know its true nature and distance themselves.

A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—such acts have occurred in the world, not to seek fame through death, but because the heart’s affection is stored within and cannot evade hardship.

Thus, people’s sweetness is not for the sake of Robber Zhi. *People’s sweetness* means *delighting in doing something*; a minister’s death for his lord, a son’s death for his father, is not to seek Robber Zhi’s reputation—yet Robber Zhi’s path is where they go. *Robber Zhi’s path* means *to reach that end*.

The noble person’s sorrow is not for the sake of feigning appearance—it resonates with the human heart. It does not come from without but issues from within.

Righteousness honors the lord; benevolence cherishes the father. Thus, the lord’s relation to his minister is such that he can determine life and death, but cannot make him act in base or facile ways. The father’s relation to his son is such that he can rouse him, but cannot make him free of longing and sorrow. *Longing and sorrow* means *prolonged grief*, *benevolent concern*. *Benevolent concern*—parents do not delight in their child’s suffering, yet cannot prevent it.

Thus, when righteousness surpasses the lord and benevolence surpasses the father, the lord is honored and the minister is loyal, the father is kind and the son is filial.

When the sage is above, transformation and nurturing are like spirits.

The highest ruler says: "This is my nature." *The highest ruler* refers to the sovereign of august virtue.

My nature is spontaneous. The next says: "Perhaps that is how it was." This refers to the time of the Five Emperors. The people were as such, so I governed them accordingly. Thus, the *Odes* says: "Holding the reins like woven silk." The *Changes* says: "Holding to inner pattern, one may stand firm." Action in the near brings order to the far. When one examines what is done in the darkness of night, even the Duke of Zhou felt shame before his shadow—thus the noble person is cautious in solitude.

To let go of the near is to block the far. Hearing goodness is easy; aligning oneself with it is difficult. When the Master saw the three transformations of grain—*the Master* being Confucius—the three transformations being from millet to sprout, sprout to stalk—he sighed and said: "The fox dies facing its mound; shall I not turn my head toward the grain?" The grain’s ear bows toward its root: the noble person does not forget their origin. Thus, when the noble person sees goodness, they painfully apply it to themselves. The pain of self-examination determines one’s own goodness or fault. If the self is upright, drawing the distant near becomes easy. *Drawing near* means *to bring close*.

Thus, the *Odes* says: "If one does not act in person, the common people will not trust." When petty persons undertake affairs, they say, "Let it be merely obtained." The noble person says, "Let it be merely righteous." What they seek is the same, but what they await differs. Striking a boat in the water, the fish sink and the birds scatter—though they hear the same sound, their responses differ, yet their essence is one.

Xi Fuji marked his lane with a pot of food—*Xi Fuji* being a minister of Cao; when Chong’er of Jin passed through Cao, Fuji presented him with a pot of food. When Chong’er returned to Jin and attacked Cao, he ordered his troops not to enter Fuji’s lane. Zhao Xuanmeng saved himself with a bundle of dried meat—*Zhao Xuanmeng* being a minister of Jin; he saved Ling Zhe with dried meat, and later escaped his own peril.

Ritual may not be abundant—*abundant* meaning *excessive*—yet virtue overflows. The stirring of a heartfelt gratitude and compassion arises, and thus its penetration into others runs deep.

The same cries and shouts—when heard by one’s family elders, they evoke deep gratitude, yet when heard by debtors, they spark strife. Thus it is said: no blade is keener than the will, while the famed *Moye* sword is but secondary; no crown is greater than yin and yang, while the drum-bearing cap is but minor.

The sage does good not to seek fame, yet fame follows; fame does not arrange with profit, yet profit accrues. Thus, people’s sorrows and joys do not arise from calculation—where would calculation lead? Words are not spoken in hope of fortuitous gain or self-serving intent.

Therefore, the perfected person remains unadorned. The one who embodies the supreme Way does not embellish appearances. It is like a mote in the eye—one rubs it, yet the action arises from within, not to be seen by others. Or like stumbling and steadying oneself—one does not do so to display composure.

The sage’s governance is so unobtrusive that worthiness goes unseen, yet in the end, its greatness becomes known. Like the sun’s journey across the sky, people do not perceive its movement, yet none can outrace its course. Even the swiftest steed cannot compete with its distance.

Now, if one searches in the night alongside a blind guide, all remains obscure—yet when the eastern sky brightens, illumination comes of itself.

Those who see illumination in its application remain blind and inactive like the sightless, while others employ it in governing affairs through reflection. Yet where movement brings benefit, harm follows—benefit itself becomes harm.

Thus the *Yi* says: "The stripping away cannot be carried to exhaustion, so it is followed by return." Things wither and then regenerate. Accumulating thinness makes thickness; piling lowliness creates height. Therefore the noble person says: "Diligently one achieves radiance," while the petty person says: "Resentfully one meets disgrace." Their waxing and waning are as imperceptible as the separation of pearls.

King Wen, hearing goodness, pursued it as if he could not reach it; lodging with wrongdoing, he treated it like an omen—yet not because time was insufficient, but because his concern extended deeply, his anxiety guiding him ever further. Thus the *Poetry* says: "Though Zhou is an old state, its mandate is ever new." It is the renewal of the nation. Embracing sincerity and holding to essence, neither Heaven can destroy nor Earth bury it. Its voice resounds between Heaven and Earth, matching the radiance of sun and moon—those who savor and delight in it.

If one inclines toward goodness, though one errs, there is no resentment; if one does not incline toward goodness, though loyal, calamity comes. Thus resenting others is not as good as resenting oneself; seeking from others is not as good as seeking within to obtain. Voice summons itself, appearance displays itself, name designates itself, pattern manifests from office—nothing is not of the self. Wielding a sharp point to stab, grasping a blade to strike—these are self-summoned; how can one resent others for one’s appearance?

Thus Guan Zhong’s patterned brocade, though coarse, ascends the ancestral temple. Though Guan Zhong, as minister of Qi, clarified laws and examined state punishments, he did not attain sageliness—yet like patterned silk, though plain, it was fitting for temple rites. Zichan’s dyed cloth, though fine, was not revered. Zichan, as minister of Zheng, placed kindness before law—like dyed cloth made into garments, warm yet unfit for ancestral rites.

Empty yet able to be filled, bland yet possessing flavor—clad in coarse cloth while holding jade. Thus two hearts cannot win one person, but one heart can win a hundred. A man plants orchids, beautiful yet unscented. Orchids are fragrant herbs; mugwort is fine and aromatic. Yet when a man plants them, they lose their fragrance. A stepson receives food, grows plump yet lacks luster—for he has a stepmother, and their feelings do not flow between them.

Life is what one borrows; death is where one returns. Thus Hong Yan upheld loyalty and died standing. Hong Yan, a minister of Duke Yi of Wei, when the Di attacked Wei and devoured the duke, found his liver remaining and slit his own belly to hold it. Prince Lǘ of Chu spread his arms to receive the blade. When the White Duke of Chu sought to enthrone Prince Lǘ, he refused; soldiers pressed him with weapons, yet he would not accept—he would not let what was entrusted harm what was to be returned.

Thus in an ordered age, one defends the self with righteousness; in a disordered age, one defends righteousness with the self. The day of death is the end of conduct, so the noble person is cautious in its singular use. The cowardly are not first timid—difficulty arrives and they lose their resolve. The greedy are not first desirous—they see profit and forget harm. Duke Yu saw the jade of Chuiji and did not perceive the disaster of Guo approaching.

Therefore the person of the supreme Way cannot be obstructed or deprived. The heart of one who embodies the supreme Way is already settled; one cannot confront them with profit to seize their will. People desire glory for themselves—what benefit is it to others? The sage practices righteousness with concern arising from within—what profit is it to the self?

Thus emperors and kings have been many, yet only the Three Kings are praised; the poor and lowly have been many, yet only Boyi is celebrated. If nobility makes one a sage, then sages would be numerous; if lowliness makes one humane, then the lowly would be many—why are sages so few? The joy of singular devotion! Swiftly, like a rushing torrent, one renews oneself, forgetting the approach of old age.

Beginning in youth, returning in maturity—this is the necessary accumulation. If one does not conceal oneself, one does not conceal others. Concealment means hiding; if one does not hide one’s own conduct, one does not hide it in others. Thus walking a single-plank bridge, one does not cease to be vigilant for lack of observers. A single-plank bridge is a bridge of one log; walking upon it, one is always cautious, fearing to fall.

Thus making others trust oneself is easy, while trusting oneself while shrouded in darkness is difficult—because one does not trust oneself in life. Feeling moves first; the ruler’s essence moves to guide the people. In movement, nothing is not obtained—all hearts are won. With nothing not obtained, there is no resentment; action brings no resentment. Though resentment may be knotted, it satisfies the people’s hearts.

Thus the actions of Yao and Shun were not to indulge emotion but to satisfy themselves so the world was ordered. Jie and Zhou were not inherently cruel—they satisfied themselves and all affairs collapsed. Joy and aversion divide order and chaos. Below, there is joyful discussion and the state is ordered; there is resentful discussion and the state is disordered.

The sage’s conduct neither aligns nor departs—like a drum, it does not tune with anything, yet nothing does not harmonize with it. Strings, pipes, bells, and stones—short and long, large and small—have their order, different sounds yet in harmony. Rulers and ministers, high and low, offices have their distinctions, different tasks yet in accord.

The weaver advances daily; the farmer retreats daily. Their work is opposite, yet their success is one. Shen Xi heard a beggar’s song and grieved; going out to see, it was his mother. Shen Xi had lost his mother, who begged by the road. In the Battle of Ailing, Fuchai said: "The Yi’s voice is yang—would that Gouwu prosper!" In the Battle of Ailing, King Fuchai of Wu fought Qi. The Yi refers to Wu; yang means declaration. Gouwu is Yi speech, not speaking Wu directly but adding a prefix.

"Abundance" means "nearly so." Though the sound is the same, the trust it elicits differs—this lies in the true emotions. Thus, when the heart is grieved, singing brings no joy; when the heart is joyful, weeping bears no sorrow. The Master said: "The strings are correct, but the sound is not." When Min Ziqian completed the three years of mourning, he took up the zither and played. The strings were correct, yet the sound was mournful and sorrowful.

Pattern is the means by which one engages with the world; it is the emotion bound within that seeks outward expression. To use pattern to obliterate emotion is to lose emotion; to use emotion to obliterate pattern is to lose pattern. When pattern, emotion, and principle flow as one, the ultimate of phoenix and unicorn is attained—this speaks of the far-reaching embrace of utmost virtue.

Shu Ziyang said to his son: "A skilled craftsman is refined within the compass and chisel." *Refined* means practiced. Within the compass and chisel, nothing is left unencompassed. The sage-king governs the people with it, Zaofu tames horses with it, and Yiluo heals illness with it. *Yiluo* refers to a physician of Yue. Each draws from the same material yet takes what they need. *Takes* means follows. Within the compass and chisel, each adopts the measure: some to govern the people, some to tame horses, some to heal illness—though the material is the same, each follows and takes the method suited to their purpose.

When the ruler’s intent is borne by the people, it is because sincerity resides within. Though the ruler has intent yet does not speak, the people carry it out. When the will arises from within, it extends to the great. Though unspoken, it is trusted; though unsummoned, it arrives—some precede it. One who is anxious about being unknown does not know oneself. *Anxious* means urgency. Arrogance arises from insufficiency. *Arrogance* means pride. *Insufficiency* means knowing one’s lack. Deceitful embellishment arises from arrogance. *Arrogance* means coveting merit.

The person of sincere inner truth delights without urgency—like the owl that loves its voice. The loyal and trustworthy person delights in acting thus, not out of urgency, but as the owl naturally loves its own voice. The bear’s love of *jing*—*jing* means movement, guiding and pulling. Who is there to be arrogant? Each follows its nature, not merely out of pride.

In spring, the maiden yearns; in autumn, the scholar grieves—when the maiden senses the yang, she yearns; when the scholar beholds the yin, he grieves. Thus one knows the transformations of things. Wailing in lament, keening in sorrow—one knows the stirring of sound. In countenance and complexion, in the patterns of deference or arrogance, one discerns sincerity and pretense. Therefore, the sage trembles inwardly and attains the utmost extreme. The fulfillment of merit and fame is of Heaven. Following principle and accepting what is fitting is of man. Jiang Ziya and the Duke of Zhou were not created by Heaven for King Wu; Chong Hou and E Lai were not born by Heaven for King Zhou. Chong Hou was a feudal lord in Zhou’s time; E Lai was Zhou’s minister and the ancestor of Qin. There is its age, and there is its man. Teaching originates with the noble person, and the petty person receives its blessings; profit originates with the petty person, and the noble person enjoys its fruits.

In the age of Donghu Jizi, a ruler of old, no one on the roads picked up lost items, and plows and surplus grain were left overnight at the crossroads, allowing noble and petty persons alike to find their proper place. Thus, when one man has cause for celebration, the multitudes depend on him. Generally, the exalted value the left, for the Way of Heaven turns to the left. Thus, those below refer to those above as "left"—this is the language of ministers. The way of ministers lies to the left of the ruler. The lowly value the right, thus those above refer to those below as "right"—this is the ruler’s deference. The ruler’s humility aids and assists his ministers. Therefore, when the superior is demoted to the left, he loses what he reveres—"left" is the language of ministers, and when the ruler is twice demoted, he loses his reverence. When the minister is promoted to the right, he loses what he values—"right" is the language of the ruler, and when the minister is twice promoted, he loses his worth.

Petty gratification harms the Way, and this nearness harms propriety. When Zichan disseminated his words—*disseminated* means to transmit—Zichan created a penal code, and people transmitted words to question him. Though the fetters multiplied ten thousandfold, there was no perversity below. Though the restraints grew more numerous, those below remained without depravity. Those who lose the truth of affairs become obstructed in their speech. Losing the truth of matters, one is hemmed in by the words of the world.

The way to build a state: artisans perform no deceptive work, farmers expend no wasted effort, scholars conceal no conduct, and officials make no errors in law. It is like setting a net—when one draws the net, its ten thousand meshes open. Shun and Yu did not receive the mandate twice; they received it from men, not from Heaven. Yao and Shun transmitted it on a grand scale, first manifesting in small ways. *Manifest* means to appear. First appearing in subtle and minor forms, they came to know the great. Governing his humble wife, extending to his brothers, and abdicating to his household and state, the world followed their example. *Abdicating* means transmitting. This speaks of Yao, Shun, and Yu passing the throne, and the world submitting to them. Thus, military campaigns discern the small through the great, as Tang and Wu used righteousness to punish the unrighteous, following the great to attack the small. People discern the great through the small. *People* refers to those in the world who followed their example. The people of Yao and Shun knew Yao’s greatness through small things.

The Way of the noble person is near yet cannot be reached, lowly yet cannot be ascended. Nothing is so laden that it cannot bear it—all things bear their burdens and fulfill their tasks. It is vast and resplendent, distant and lofty. Knowing this Way, one cannot seek it in others but must find it within oneself. Abandoning oneself to seek it in others is to distance oneself from it. The noble person delights in having surplus yet finds fame insufficient; the petty person delights in insufficiency yet finds fame excessive. Observing the distance between surplus and insufficiency, the difference is clearly vast. To contain without expressing, to harbor emotions without sprouting—such a thing has never been heard of. This speaks of holding emotions that must inevitably manifest.

The noble person thinks of righteousness and does not consider profit; the petty person covets profit and disregards righteousness. Confucius said of equal lamentation: *Equal* means the same. He said, "Alas, what has befallen me? Why has this happened to me?" Their sorrow was the same, but the cause of their sorrow differed. Thus, sorrow and joy deeply penetrate human emotions. Some dig the earth, some dredge the pools—some bore through, some fill in, speaking of differing intentions. It is not merely about exhausting the people’s labor; each follows their own desires.

Yet disorder arises from this. Though the emotions they bear are the same, their application toward others differs. Applied to others, there is good and evil. Thus, Yao and Shun daily toiled diligently to attain kingship, while Jie and Zhou daily indulged recklessly to meet their doom—unaware that later generations would mock them.

In all human emotions, to be relieved of suffering is joy; to lose what brings joy is sorrow. Thus, to know the joy of life is necessarily to know the sorrow of death. Those of principle cannot be deceived by profit; those of courage cannot be coerced by fear—just as the hungry and thirsty cannot be deceived by empty vessels.

People often desire what harms their sense of right; desire breeds greed, and greed erodes rightness. Excessive worry harms wisdom, for greed and anxiety obstruct and block—thus harming wisdom. Excessive fear harms courage.

Arrogance arises from petty persons—arrogance meaning insolence. Such is the conduct of petty persons. Even barbarians are capable of it; arrogance is the way of barbarians. Goodness arises from noble persons, shining forth to rival the sun and moon in splendor. The world cannot suppress or steal it away.

Therefore, a well-governed state delights in what sustains it, while a doomed state also delights in what destroys it.

Gold and tin do not melt and flow unless refined—just as law does not govern the people unless the ruler’s concern is sincere.  *Criminal law.*
If the ruler’s concern is insincere, it cannot guide the people.
When concern does not reach the people, it severs the people’s bond; bonds are what restrain and uphold them.
When the ruler returns to the root, the people’s bond becomes firm.

Virtue of the highest order perfects minor details while fulfilling great ones.
Duke Huan of Qi fulfilled great deeds but was not meticulous—his great integrity overshadowed his minor lapses.
Duke Wen of Jin was meticulous but did not fulfill great deeds—his minor details obscured his great integrity.
Duke Wen gained it within the inner chambers yet lost it beyond the borders—his inner chambers were cultivated while his outer domains fell into chaos.
Duke Huan lost it within the inner chambers yet gained it in the court—his inner chambers were disordered while his court was well-governed.

Water flows downward and expands; the ruler yields to ministers and gains wisdom.
When the ruler does not contend with ministers over merit, the Dao of governance flows unimpeded.

Guan Yiwu and Baili Xi planned and perfected it—*Baili Xi, a man of Yu, later chief minister of Qin.*
Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Mu of Qin received and heeded their counsel—*heeding the strategies of these two ministers.*

The deluded take east for west; confusion reigns until dawn breaks—*seeing the sun, one awakens.*
Duke Wu of Wei said to his ministers, *"Do not dismiss me as old—*the duke was ninety-five at the time—*and deem me feeble. If I err, you must report it."*
Thus, though the duke seemed not feeble, he ensured feebleness would not go unnoticed—hence, though aged, he did not abandon vigilance, for he grasped the discourse on preservation and ruin.

People have no power to initiate, yet have the power to act;
having the power to act, they lack the power to complete.
What people do, Heaven completes.

A lifetime of goodness cannot proceed without Heaven;
a lifetime of evil cannot perish without Heaven.
Thus, good and ill lie with me;
fortune and misfortune do not.
What does not lie with me is Heaven’s doing.
Therefore, the noble person follows only what lies within.

Nature is what one receives from Heaven;
fate is what one encounters in time.
Possessing the talent but not meeting the era—this is Heaven.
What merit did the Grand Duke have? What crime did Bi Gan commit?
Following one’s nature and acting accordingly, some meet harm, others gain—seeking it through the Dao, attaining it lies in fate.
Thus, the noble person can do good yet cannot ensure fortune;
can refrain from evil yet cannot guarantee escape from misfortune.

The ruler is the root; ministers are the branches and leaves.
A root that is not fine yet bears lush branches and leaves—this has never been heard of.

In an era of the Dao, one entrusts the state to a person—*as Yao entrusted the world to Shun.*
In an era without the Dao, one entrusts a person with the state.
Yao ruled the world yet his worries remained unrelieved; upon bestowing it to Shun, his worries dissolved.
Worrying yet guarding it, delighting in sharing it with the worthy to the end—he did not keep its benefits for himself.

All things have their use—nothing is too small to be of service;
when something is deemed useless, it is because one does not know its purpose.

Jade buried in dung is but filth—jade being the gemstone. If one does not know its use, it becomes mere refuse. Human nature, when faced with harm, contends for the lesser share; when faced with profit, contends for the greater. Thus, those who share the same dish yet crave the thickest slices—thick slices being thick-cut meat—must surely find them sweet. Those who study under the same master yet surpass the rest must surely delight in their pursuit. Without sweetness, without joy, how can one become eminent? Eminence means standing out visibly.

The noble person advances when the time is right, obtaining it through righteousness—what fortune is there in that? When the time is not right, they retreat, yielding through righteousness—what misfortune is there in that? Thus, Boyi starved to death beneath Mount Shouyang—Boyi, son of the Lord of Guzhu, who yielded the state to his brother and refused to eat Zhou grain, hence his starvation—yet he never regretted it, casting aside what he scorned to gain what he valued. This is what it means to seek rightly in others and obtain it.

The sprouts of fortune grow ever so subtly; the birth of misfortune comes bit by bit. Since the beginnings of fortune and misfortune are so faint, the people grow careless. Only the sage sees the beginning and knows the end. Hence the saying: "The Lu wine was thin, and Handan was besieged." Lu and Zhao both paid tribute to Chu, offering wine. The Lu wine was thin, while the Zhao wine was rich. The Chu official in charge of wine demanded wine from Zhao, which was refused. Enraged, the official presented the Zhao wine to the Chu king, having switched it with the thin Lu wine. The Chu king, believing the Zhao wine to be thin, besieged Handan. Another version says Lu and Zhao offered wine to Zhou. This story appears in the *Zhuangzi*. "The mutton broth was not ladled out, and the state of Song was imperiled." When Song’s Hua Yuan was about to battle Zheng, he slaughtered sheep to feed his troops but did not share with his charioteer. In battle, the charioteer drove the horses into the Zheng army, and Hua Yuan was captured.

The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for their own sake but for the state. Those who benefit themselves yet do no good for the state receive no reward. Those who oppose themselves yet benefit the state incur no punishment. Thus, King Zhuang of Chu said to Gong Yong: "Those with virtue receive my ranks and emoluments; those with merit receive my fields and estates. You possess neither—what can I give you?" Could this be called unreasonable? When he dismissed Gong Yong, he still did not withhold encouragement.

Zhou governance reached the Dao; Yin governance was good, skillful in teaching, yet did not reach the Dao; Xia governance was enacted—its practices were still coarse. Good governance does not necessarily reach the ultimate. The person who has attained the utmost does not admire mere action, nor feel shame at mere goodness. Embracing virtue and treading the Way, they delight in harmony above and below, yet do not know how it comes to be.

Many have ruled states, yet only Qi Huan and Jin Wen are renowned. On Mount Tai, there are seventy altars—seventy-two lords performed the Feng sacrifice there—yet only the Three Kings are spoken of as having attained the Way. The ruler does not seek from ministers; ministers do not borrow from the ruler. Cultivating what is near, they extend to what is far, and later generations praise their greatness. They compose their achievements without stepping beyond their neighbors, yet none can match them. Thus, the rites of Xiaoji could be emulated—Xiaoji, son of King Gaozong of Yin, who was exiled yet never failed in ritual—yet none could deprive him of his reputation, for they could not attain what he held in his heart. Those who could not compete with Xiaoji for renown could not grasp what he cherished.

The noble person is one for whom righteousness aligns with what is fitting; the petty person is one for whom what is fitting is abandoned for righteousness. The person of penetrating wisdom achieves labor without toil; the next achieves toil without distress; the lowest suffers distress without achieving labor.

The ancients savored yet did not covet—knowing the flavor yet not craving the food. Modern people covet yet do not savor. Confucius, in teaching the people of Lu, merely let them drink their fill, for only the steadfast can truly savor. He refined their songs, lengthening their tones—this speaks of how music transforms customs and mores—yet the tones were still insufficient to achieve perfect beauty, for such tones could not bring about the highest transformation. Metal, stone, silk, and bamboo assist in their performance, yet even this is not enough to reach the ultimate. The ultimate is the perfection of harmonious transformation. If people can honor the Dao and practice righteousness, regulating their joy and anger, taking and giving accordingly, then their transformation of the people surpasses even music—like grass bending to the wind. When the wind passes over the grass, it must lie flat.

The Duke of Shao, during the seasons of silkworm cultivation and plowing, released prisoners and ended detentions—he was the Grand Protector of Zhou—so that the people could return to their work and fulfill their duties. King Wen declined a gift of a thousand *li* of land and instead requested the abolition of the *paoluo* punishment. King Zhou imprisoned King Wen; King Wen presented treasures to Zhou, who rewarded him with a thousand *li* of land. King Wen refused it, wishing to abolish the *paoluo* torture.

Thus, when the sage undertakes affairs, their advance and retreat are never untimely—like summer’s use of fine hempen cloth and the handing of reins upon mounting a chariot. Laozi studied under Shang Rong and, seeing his tongue, understood the value of guarding softness—Shang Rong was a divine man; when he stuck out his tongue, Laozi saw that the tongue is soft while the teeth are hard. Liezi studied under Master Hu, observing the pillar’s shadow and understanding the value of holding back—for form precedes shadow, and while form may perish, shadow cannot be harmed. Thus, the sage does not precede things but always controls them, like piling firewood—what comes later is placed on top.

People unite through righteousness, form factions through partisanship, and grow strong through factions. Therefore, where virtue is widely bestowed, authority extends far; where righteousness is shallowly applied, military control is limited.

Thus, the accumulation of virtue spreads broadly, and its influence reaches afar. Where righteousness is applied superficially, the scope of its power is small.

The *duo* bell destroys itself with its own sound—*duo* refers to a large bell, originating from Wu. The grease candle melts itself with its own light. The patterns of tigers and leopards invite arrows; the agility of gibbons and macaques invites spears—*cuo* means to stab.

Thus, Zilu died by his courage, perishing in the crisis of Duke Zhe of Wei. Chang Hong was ensnared by his own wisdom. Seeking to aid Zhou with his schemes, the people of Zhou killed him. He could wield wisdom with wisdom, yet could not wield wisdom to avoid unwisdom.

Therefore, those who traverse peril cannot tread the straight path; those who emerge from the forest cannot take the direct route. Walking at night, one advances with eyes closed and hands outstretched. Affairs may reach their limit, yet clarity does not necessarily bring harm.

If one can penetrate the obscure to enter the luminous, one may speak of the ultimate. The magpie’s nest foresees where the wind will rise—when winds are frequent, magpies build their nests low. The otter’s den knows the water’s height—where the water reaches, the otter avoids and builds its den elsewhere. The *hui* bird knows when the sky will clear—the *hui* is the turtledove. *Yan* means cloudless. When the sky is about to clear and grow still, the *hui* cries first. The *yin xie* knows when rain will come—the *yin xie* is the female of the *hui*. When rain is imminent, it calls.

To say that human wisdom is inferior to that of birds and beasts would be incorrect. Thus, one skilled in a single craft or discerning in a single word may engage in narrow discourse, but cannot respond broadly.

Ning Qi struck the ox’s horn and sang, and Duke Huan appointed him to great office. Yongmen Zi moved Mengchang Jun to tears with his weeping, his sobs soaking his cap strings. Singing and weeping are things all people can do; yet when a single sound enters the ear, it stirs the heart—such is the utmost of emotion.

Thus, the laws of Tang and Yu may be imitated, but their ability to move the human heart cannot be matched. Duke Jian was killed by softness—Duke Jian was the ruler of Qi. Through gentleness and compliance, Tian Chengzi slew him. Ziyang was overthrown by harshness—Ziyang was the minister of Zheng. Favoring punishment, he was coerced to death. Neither grasped the Dao.

Thus, singing that does not accord with the pitch-standards is uniform in its high and low tones; though high and low may lose harmony, it still fails to meet the full measure of the pitch. Beyond the marking-line and within the marking-line, both miss true straightness.

Zhou made ivory chopsticks, and Jizi sighed in alarm—for he knew that ivory chopsticks would lead to jade cups, and jade cups would lead to the pursuit of extreme flavors. Lu buried a wooden effigy, and Confucius lamented, for it resembled a person and was used as such. Seeing the beginning, one knows the end.

Thus, water flows from the mountains into the sea; crops grow in the fields and are stored in granaries. The sage, seeing their origin, knows their destination. Murky waters make fish gasp; harsh commands make people rebel. Steep walls must collapse; towering banks must crumble. Thus, Shang Yang established laws and was torn limb from limb—Shang Yang set governance for Duke Xiao of Qin, but the people resented him and executed him by dismemberment. Wu Qi enforced harsh measures and was torn apart by chariots—Wu Qi, as minister of Chu, instituted laws of collective punishment for nobles, and was ultimately torn apart by chariots.

Governing a state is like tuning a zither: if the great strings are tightened to excess, the small strings will snap. Thus, those who spur the reins and whip frequently are not drivers of a thousand-mile steed. A sound with form carries no farther than a hundred li; a sound without form reaches the four seas.

Therefore, emoluments exceeding merit bring loss; fame exceeding reality brings obscurity. When conduct and reputation align, fortune and misfortune do not arrive without cause. A body plagued by ominous dreams cannot overcome upright conduct; a state beset by omens cannot overcome good governance. Thus, before there are chariots and caps of office as rewards, one cannot obtain them without merit; behind there are axes and halberds as punishments, one cannot escape them without guilt.

Those who cultivate integrity do not depart from the Dao. The noble person does not dismiss small good as insufficient to act upon and abandon it, for small good accumulates into great good; nor does he deem small evil as harmless and commit it, for small evil accumulates into great evil. Thus, feathers accumulate to sink a boat, and many light things break an axle—therefore, the noble person prohibits the minute.

A single moment of pleasure does not suffice to become good, but pleasure accumulated becomes virtue; a single moment of resentment does not suffice to become wrong, but resentment accumulated becomes enmity. Thus, the goodness of the Three Dynasties was the accumulation of a thousand years of praise; the infamy of Jie and Zhou was the accumulation of a thousand years of slander.

Heaven has four seasons; humans have four uses. What are the four uses? In seeing and giving form, nothing is clearer than the eye; in hearing and refining, nothing is keener than the ear; in weighing and closing, nothing is firmer than the mouth; in dwelling and storing, nothing is deeper than the heart. The eye sees its form, the ear hears its sound, the mouth speaks its sincerity, and the heart attains its essence—thus, the transformation and completion of the myriad things have their limit.

The earth expands through virtue, and the ruler expands his land through virtue. The ruler is exalted through virtue—this is the highest; the earth expands through rightness, and the ruler is exalted through rightness—this is the next; the earth expands through strength, and the ruler is exalted through strength—this is the lowest. Thus, the pure become kings, the mixed become hegemons, and those lacking even one perish.

In ancient times, the two phoenixes arrived at the court, the Three Dynasties reached the gates, and the House of Zhou reached the marshes. The more profound the virtue, the farther its reach; the more refined the virtue, the nearer its reach. The noble person, being truly humane, is humane in bestowing and humane in not bestowing—this is what is meant by "not bestowing yet humane." The petty person, being truly inhumane, is inhumane in bestowing and inhumane in not bestowing. That goodness originates from oneself, rather than from others, is the flourishing of humaneness and virtue.

Thus, those who conquer desire with essence flourish; those who are conquered by desire perish. To know the Dao of Heaven, examine its numbers—the numbers of pitch-standards and calendars. To know the Dao of Earth, observe its plantings—the suitability of the five soils, each with its proper growth. To know the Dao of Humans, follow their desires. The noble person desires the Dao; the petty person desires profit.

Do not startle, do not alarm, and the myriad things will order themselves; do not disturb, do not entangle, and the myriad things will clarify themselves—this is to say, governing the world is to follow the nature of each. Those who examine a single aspect cannot speak of transformation; those who scrutinize a single time cannot speak of the great—like the cicada that knows not the cold.

The sun knows not the night, the moon knows not the day; sun and moon provide light but cannot encompass both. Only Heaven and Earth can contain them. That which can embrace Heaven and Earth is called the formless.

Arrogant rulers have no loyal ministers; glib-tongued people have no certain trust. Intertwined trees have no graspable branches; shallow ditches have no fish that can swallow a boat. Shallow roots make short branches; injured trunks make withered boughs. Blessing arises from non-action; calamity arises from excessive desire. Harm arises from lack of preparation; filth arises from lack of cleansing.

The sage does good as if fearing he will not reach it, and prepares for misfortune as if fearing he will not escape it. Covered in dust yet wishing to remain unstained, or wading through water yet wishing to stay dry—this cannot be. Thus, those who know themselves do not resent others; those who know fate do not resent Heaven. Fortune arises from oneself; misfortune is born of oneself.

The sage does not seek praise, does not avoid slander, rectifies himself and walks straight—thus, all perversities cease of themselves. Now, to abandon the upright and pursue the crooked, to turn from what is right and follow the crowd, is to run abreast with the vulgar while one’s inner conduct lacks the marking-line. Therefore, the sage turns inward and does not follow.

The Dao that has chapters and defined forms is not the ultimate; tasted, it has no flavor; seen, it has no form—it cannot be transmitted to others.

Great spurge dispels water, and lepidium relieves distension—yet if used without moderation, they turn and become illness. Many things resemble them yet are not; only the sage perceives their subtleties.

The skilled charioteer does not forget his horses; the skilled archer does not forget his crossbow; the skilled ruler does not forget those below. If one can truly love and benefit them, the world will follow. Without love and benefit, even a child will rebel against its father.

In the world, there is supreme nobility not of rank and status; there is supreme wealth not of gold and jade; there is supreme longevity not of a thousand years. Return to the original heart and revert to one’s nature, and one attains nobility. Follow one’s feelings and know contentment, and one attains wealth. Understand the distinction between life and death, and one attains longevity.

Those whose words lack constant rightness and whose actions lack constant propriety are petty persons. Those who examine one matter and comprehend one principle—are these middling persons? Only those who embrace all things, measure each by their capacity, and govern accordingly are sages. To govern is to regulate—to measure their capacities and regulate their use.

**Harmonizing Customs**

"Harmonizing" means unifying. The winds of the four directions and the manifold principles of the world—all blend their customs to become one Dao. To follow one’s nature in action is called the Dao; to attain one’s heavenly nature is called virtue. When nature is lost, then benevolence is prized; when the Dao is lost, then righteousness is prized. Thus, when benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue shift away. When rites and music are adorned, pure simplicity scatters. When right and wrong take shape, the common people are dazzled. When pearls and jade are honored, the world contends. These four things are the creations of a declining age, the tools of a degenerate era.

Rites serve to distinguish the noble from the base, to differentiate the honored from the lowly. Righteousness serves to unite the bonds of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, and friends. Yet in this age, those who practice rites do so with reverence but harbor resentment—*zhi* means harm, pronounced *zhi*. Those who practice righteousness distribute alms and claim virtue. Rulers and ministers reproach one another; kinfolk breed resentment. This is to lose the root of rites and righteousness, thus breeding entanglements and multiplying grievances. *Gou* means to forge alliances through power, which fade when power wanes, leaving only hollow ties.

When water accumulates, it breeds fish that devour one another; when earth piles high, it breeds beasts that burrow into their own dens. When rites and righteousness are adorned, they give rise to the roots of deceit and concealment. One who blows ashes yet wishes not to be blinded, or wades through water yet wishes not to get wet—this cannot be.

In ancient times, the people were simple and ignorant, not knowing east from west. Their appearance did not exceed their feelings, nor did their words surpass their deeds. Their clothing provided warmth without ornament; their weapons were blunt and edgeless—*zhu* in Chu dialect means a blunted blade. Their songs were joyful without modulation; their wails were sorrowful without sound. They drank from wells they dug and ate from fields they tilled, seeking no embellishment nor desiring gain. Relatives did not slander or flatter one another; friends did not resent or owe debts.

But when rites and righteousness arose and goods and wealth were prized, deceit and falsehood sprouted. Praise and blame intertwined; resentment and virtue ran side by side. Thus emerged the exemplary virtue of Zeng Shen and Xiaoji, alongside the wickedness of Dao Zhi and Zhuang Qiao. Therefore, where there are grand carriages and dragon banners, feathered canopies and trailing tassels—*dalu* is the Son of Heaven’s chariot; *longqi* is the dragon banner—where four-horse teams and linked riders gather, there must also be thieves who bore through walls, pry open doors, and steal from granaries—*chou* means to grasp; *bei* refers to the rear wall. Where there are intricate brocades, fine silks, and delicate gauze—*ruoci* is fine cloth; *luo* is net-like fabric; *wan* is plain silk—there must also be sandals of sed

Thus the *Yijing* states: "Tread upon frost, and solid ice will come." The sage perceives endings and beginnings through subtle words.

Hence, wine-dreg mounds arise from appearances—King Zhou’s night-long feasts, where dregs piled into hills, began with semblance. The roasting pillar arises from rising heat. When a cook presented soup to Zhou, finding it too hot and deeming it harmful, he was executed with the same heat, giving rise to the roasting pillar. A steamer can kill a man, so the roasting pillar was devised.

Zilu lifted a drowning man and received an ox in gratitude—*zheng* means to lift; the master rewarded him with an ox. Confucius said, "The state of Lu will surely favor rescuing people from peril."

Zigong ransomed a man but refused payment from the treasury—Lu’s law stipulated that those who ransomed people from other states received payment from the treasury. Confucius said, "The state of Lu will no longer ransom people."

Zilu accepted reward and encouraged virtue; Zigong declined and halted goodness. Confucius’s insight lay in knowing the great from the small, the distant from the near, penetrating all discourse.

From this we see: integrity has its place, but cannot be universally practiced. Thus, conduct aligned with custom may be followed; affairs suited to ability are easily done. Pride in deceit deludes the world; defiant conduct estranges the multitude—sages do not make these the people’s customs.

Spacious halls and connected chambers, where humans find comfort, distress birds that enter them. Towering mountains and perilous passes, dense forests and thickets, where tigers and leopards delight, terrify humans who enter. Rivers and valleys flowing into plains, deep waters and layered springs, where soft-shelled turtles and alligators thrive, bring death to humans who enter.

The *Xianchi* and *Chengyun* were the music of the Yellow Emperor; the *Jiushao* was the music of Shun; the *Liuying* was the music of Emperor Zhuanxu. What humans enjoy, birds and beasts hear with alarm. Deep ravines and sheer cliffs, towering trees and lofty branches, where gibbons and monkeys delight, make humans who climb them tremble.

Different forms and contrary natures mean what brings joy may bring sorrow, what brings safety may bring danger. Even to the bounds of heaven and earth’s embrace, the illumination of sun and moon, let each follow its nature, dwell in its proper place, abide in its fitting role, and perform its capacity.

Thus, the foolish have their refinements, the wise their insufficiencies. A pillar cannot prop up teeth; a small hairpin cannot support a roof—*kuang* is a small hairpin. A horse cannot bear heavy loads; an ox cannot chase speed. Lead cannot make a blade; bronze cannot make a crossbow; iron cannot make a boat; wood cannot make a cauldron. Each is used where it fits, applied where it is suitable, and thus the myriad things are equalized, with no means to surpass one another.

A bright mirror is suited for reflecting form, but for holding food, it is not as good as a bamboo basket. A sacrificial ox with flawless fur is fitting for temple offerings, but for summoning rain, it is not as effective as a black snake—*heixi* is a divine serpent that lurks in sacred abysses and can stir clouds and rain.

From this we see: things have no inherent nobility or baseness. If you value what is valued, nothing is not noble; if you demean what is demeaned, nothing is not base.

Unworked jade is not faulted for its thickness; horn sheaths are not faulted for their thinness—*jiao* is the covering sheath between a sword’s blade and hilt. Lacquer is not faulted for its blackness; powder is not faulted for its whiteness. These four are opposites, yet when urgency is equal, their use is the same.

Now, between fur coats and straw raincoats, which is more urgent? When rain falls, fur coats are not used; when ascending the hall, straw raincoats are not worn—these alternate as the norm. It is like boats, carts, shields, sleds, and humble huts, each having its proper use. Water is naturally suited for boats; dry land for carts; sandy ground for sleds; muddy ground for shields; open fields for humble huts.

Thus Laozi said: "Do not ascend," for the worthy—meaning do not seek fish in trees or drown birds in the abyss. Each thing follows its proper place, so there is no need to employ the worthy.

When Yao governed the world, Shun was Minister of Education, Xie was Minister of War, Yu was Minister of Works, Hou Ji was Grand Minister of Agriculture, and Xi Zhong was Minister of Crafts. In guiding the myriad people, those by water fished; those in mountains logged; those in valleys herded; those on land farmed. The land suited its tasks, tasks suited their tools, tools suited their uses, and uses suited their people.

Marshlands wove nets; hillsides tilled fields. They exchanged what they had for what they lacked, what they were skilled in for what they were clumsy at. Thus, those who rebelled were few, and those who obeyed were many. It is like scattering gaming pieces on the ground: round ones roll to the marsh, square ones rest on high ground, each following what is secure—what hierarchy is there?

Like wind encountering a flute—*xiao* is a reed pipe—it suddenly stirs them, each responding with its clear or deep tones. When gibbons and monkeys find lush trees, they do not leave but make dens; when badgers and raccoon dogs find embankments and dikes—*huan* is the badger; *duo* is a water embankment; *fang* is a dike—they do not depart but cling to them. No creature avoids what benefits it to seek what harms it.

Thus, neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard across borders, yet the footprints of lords do not cross into others’ territories, nor do cart tracks extend beyond a thousand *li*—all find what they deem secure.

Therefore, a disordered state seems full; a well-ordered state seems empty. A ruined state seems insufficient; a preserved state seems abundant. The "empty" is not without people, but all guard their duties. The "full" is not overpopulated, but all are arrogant in trivialities. The "abundant" is not wealthy, but desires are restrained and affairs few. The "insufficient" is not without goods, but the people are restless and expenditures many.

Thus, the laws of the former kings were not their own creations but what they followed. Their prohibitions and punishments were not their own inventions but what they upheld. In all cases, governing things with things does not rely on things but on harmony; governing harmony does not rely on harmony but on people.

Governance of people does not rely on people but on the ruler; governance of the ruler does not rely on the ruler but on desire; governance of desire does not rely on desire but on nature; governance of nature does not rely on nature but on virtue; governance of virtue does not rely on virtue but on the Dao.

When human nature is overgrown and murky, failing to attain clarity, it is because external things have imposed their measures upon it. *Kè* is swirling dust. The Qiang, Di, Bo, and Hu—when infants are born, all cry with the same voice. The Qiang are the Rong of the west; the Di, the Yi of the south; the Bo, the Yi of the west; the Hu, the northern barbarians. Yet as they grow, though they may encounter the Xiangdi or the Tí—*Xiangdi Tí* refers to interpreters—still they cannot understand one another’s speech, for their teachings and customs differ. Now, if a three-month-old infant were born and then moved to another land, it would not know the old customs. From this we see: clothing, rituals, and customs are not inherent in human nature but are received from without.

The nature of bamboo is to float, yet when cut into slips and bound together, it sinks when cast into water, for it has lost its original form. The nature of metal is to sink, yet when placed upon a boat, it floats, for the circumstances lend support. Unbleached silk is white by nature, but when dyed with mud, it turns black; raw silk is yellow by nature, but when dyed with cinnabar, it turns red. Human nature is not inherently depraved, yet long immersion in custom alters it. Once altered, it forgets its root and merges with what seems its nature. When this seeming nature merges with another nature, it remains distinct from the original nature.

Thus, the moon and sun wish to shine, but floating clouds obscure them; the river wishes to run clear, but sand and stones muddy it; human nature wishes to be balanced, but cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can abandon external things and return to the self.

One who boards a boat and becomes disoriented does not know east from west; only upon seeing the Dipper and the Pole Star does one awaken. Nature is humanity’s Dipper and Pole Star. When one sees by means of the self, one does not lose the true nature of things; without self-awareness, one moves in confusion and distraction—like a traveler in Longxi, the more frantic one grows, the deeper one sinks.

Confucius said to Yan Hui, “I admire you, yet forget myself.” Confucius was humble, claiming ignorance while admiring Hui—this is forgetting conduct. “And you admire me, yet forget yourself.” “Even so, though you forget, I still retain what cannot be forgotten.” Confucius knew the root.

To indulge desire and lose one’s nature is to act without ever being upright. In governing the self, it leads to peril; in governing the state, to disorder; in leading an army, to defeat. Thus, those who have not heard the Dao have no means to return to their nature.

Therefore, the sage-kings of old were able to attain it within themselves, so their commands were obeyed and prohibitions enforced, their names transmitted to later generations, and their virtue extended across the four seas. For this reason, whenever they were about to undertake an affair, they first calmed their minds and purified their spirits. When the mind was calm, things could be set right—like a seal pressing into clay: the seal is straight, so the impression is straight; if the seal is crooked, the impression is crooked.

Thus, when Yao elevated Shun, he decided by looking into his eyes; when Duke Huan chose Ning Qi, he judged by listening to his voice. If one were to abandon methods and rely solely on ears and eyes, disorder would surely worsen. That ears and eyes can judge is because they reflect the true nature of feelings. Yet if one’s hearing is misled by slander and praise, and one’s eyes are seduced by colors, to seek correct governance becomes difficult.

One who bears sorrow weeps upon hearing song; one who bears joy laughs upon seeing someone weep. What could be joyful in sorrow, or sorrowful in joy, is determined by what one carries. Therefore, emptiness is prized—emptiness means the heart carries no sorrow or joy.

Thus, when water is struck, waves arise; when qi is disordered, wisdom is clouded. Clouded wisdom cannot govern; turbulent water cannot be level. Therefore, the sage-king holds to the One and does not lose it, and the true nature of the myriad things is complete, while the four barbarians and the nine provinces submit.

The One is most noble, without preference in the world. The sage records no preferences, so the people’s fate is secured. Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy; those who practice righteousness must clarify taking and giving.

The eye sees no farther than ten *li*, yet one wishes to illuminate all within the seas—sorrow and joy cannot suffice. Without the world’s accumulated wealth, one wishes to provide for all the people—benefit cannot be enough.

Moreover, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise naturally from stimuli. Thus, weeping issues from the mouth, tears from the eyes—these all well up within and take form without, like water flowing downward or smoke rising upward. Who pushes them?

Therefore, forced weeping, though painful, is not sorrowful; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True feeling arises within and responds in voice without. Thus, the humble meal of Li Fuqi was better than Duke Xian of Jin’s *Chuiji* jades—Duke Xian used *Chuiji* to destroy Yu and Guo. The dried meat of Zhao Xuanmeng was worthier than Zhi Bo’s great bell—Zhi Bo used the great bell to destroy Chouyou.

Thus, lavish ritual cannot prove love, but sincere heart can win over distant peoples. When Gongxi Hua served his parents, he was as if among friends—Gongxi Hua was a disciple of Confucius. Among friends, one is harmonious but shows little reverence. When Zeng Shen served his parents, he was as if before a stern and severe lord—*lie* means harsh. Zengzi served his parents with great reverence. Yet in serving them, the two were one.

The Hu people swear oaths by striking bones—their covenants are made by placing wine in a human skull and drinking to curse one another. The Yue people cut their arms—carving the arm to draw blood. In the Central States, they smear blood—killing an animal and smearing its blood to pledge trust. Though their methods differ, in trust they are one.

The Sanmiao people bind their hair with hemp—their land lies in the wilds of Pengli and Dongting. The Qiang people tie their collars—*kuo* means to knot. In the Central States, they wear caps and hairpins—*ji* means hairpin. The Yue people cut their hair—*jian* means to sever. Yet in attire, they are one.

By Emperor Zhuanxu’s law, if a woman did not yield the path to men, she was struck at the crossroads—*fu* means to imitate. Now in the capital cities, men and women press close, their shoulders brushing on the roads—*qi* means foot. Yet in custom, they are one.

Thus, though the rites of the Four Barbarians differ, all honor their lords and love their kin, respect their elder brothers. The customs of the Xianyun are the opposite—the Xianyun are the northern Hu. Their ways and things are contrary to those of the Central States. Yet all cherish their children and revere their superiors. Birds fly in formation, beasts gather in herds—who teaches them?

The state of Lu observed the rites of the Ru and practiced Confucius’ teachings, yet its land dwindled and its name faded, unable to draw near or win over the distant. King Goujian of Yue cut his hair and tattooed his body, wore no cap of rank or sash with tablet—*pibian* is the cap of nobility; *jin* means to tuck; *hu* is the tablet, three feet long, tapering to a square end. His bearing was constrained and square—*juba* means rounded; *juzhe* means angular. Yet he triumphed over Fu Chai at the Five Lakes and became hegemon over all under Heaven, so that the twelve lords of the Si region led the Nine Yi to pay court.

The states of the Hu, Mo, and Xiongnu let their bodies go loose and their hair hang free—*tuo* means unbound. They sit cross-legged and speak in reverse, yet their lands do not perish. This is not to say they lack rites. King Zhuang of Chu wore trailing robes and wide sleeves—*ju* means to drape; *yi* means garment. His commands reached all under Heaven, and he became hegemon over the feudal lords. Duke Wen of Jin wore coarse cloth and a sheepskin coat, girded his sword with leather, yet his might stood firm throughout the land. Must rites be only those of Zou and Lu—Zou, the town of Meng Ke; Lu, the town of Confucius?

Thus, when entering a state, follow its customs; when entering a household, avoid its taboos. Do not violate prohibitions to enter, nor meet with opposition to advance. Even in the lands of the Yi and Di, where people go naked—*tuluo* means unclothed—though you travel to the farthest reaches, you will meet no obstacle.

Rites are the ornament of substance; benevolence is the manifestation of kindness. Thus rites are patterned after human feelings to set proper bounds, while benevolence arises spontaneously to find acceptance. *Heng* means countenance. Rites do not exceed substance, and benevolence does not overflow in kindness—this is the Way of a well-ordered age.

The three-year mourning is a strain beyond what people can bear, yet it uses artifice to aid feeling. The three-month mourning cuts off grief and presses upon human nature—the three-month mourning is the rite of the Xia. The Ru and Mohists do not examine the beginning and end of human feelings but strive to practice opposing systems, such as the five degrees of mourning. The five degrees of mourning refer to the three-year, one-year, nine-month, five-month, and three-month mourning. Grief clings to the heart, and burial matches the means of support. Do not force people to do what they cannot, nor cut off what they can cease. Measure and balance do not err in appropriateness, and praise or blame have no cause to arise.

The ancients were not unaware of the elaborate rites of ascending and descending, circling and turning, nor of the stately steps of *Caiji* and *Sixia*—*Caiji* and *Sixia* are names of music. They deemed such things a waste of time and a burden to the people, serving no purpose. Thus they made rites sufficient to aid substance and convey intent. The ancients were not incapable of arraying bells and drums, filling the air with pipes and flutes, brandishing shields and axes, waving feathered banners. But they saw such things as squandering wealth and disrupting governance, so they made music sufficient to unite joy and express feeling, without excess in sound.

They were not incapable of exhausting the state’s resources and impoverishing the people, emptying the treasury and depleting wealth, adorning with pearls and embroidery, binding with silk cords and tying with knots—*lin shi* refers to royal fields; *lun* means silk floss; *shu* means to bind. Yet they saw such lavish burials as ruining the people’s livelihood and benefiting neither dry bones nor rotting flesh. Thus they made burial sufficient to gather and cover the dead.

Long ago, when Shun was buried at Cangwu, the markets did not alter their stalls—Shun died while on a southern tour of inspection and was buried at Cangwu, his tomb at the foot of Mount Jiuyi. He did not trouble the markets or cause any neglect. When Yu was buried at Mount Kuaiji, the farmers did not change their fields—Yu gathered his ministers at Kuaiji and was buried on the southern slope of the mountain. He did not trouble the farmers’ fields. They understood the distinction between life and death and grasped the proper measure of frugality and extravagance.

Disordered states are not so: words contradict deeds, feelings oppose appearances. Rites are made cumbersome, music is made excessive, death is exalted to harm the living, and prolonged mourning is used to seek favor. Thus customs grow corrupt in the age, and praise or blame sprouts in the court. This is why the sages abolished and did not use such things.

Righteousness is to follow principle and act appropriately; rites are to embody feeling and pattern form. Righteousness is appropriateness; rites are embodiment. Long ago, the Youhu clan acted with righteousness and perished—the Youhu were the younger brothers of Xia Qi. They saw that Yao and Shun raised the worthy, while Yu alone passed the throne to his son, so they attacked Qi, and Qi destroyed them. They knew righteousness but not appropriateness. Lu practiced rites but was diminished—it knew rites but not embodiment.

In the sacrifices of the Youyu clan, their altar was made of earth—an altar of piled earth. They sacrificed to the central eaves and buried in the fields—burying in the furrows of the fields. Their music was *Xianchi*, *Chengyun*, and *Jiushao*—Shun used the music of the Yellow Emperor as well. *Jiushao* was composed by Shun. Their garments favored yellow—Shun corresponded to the virtue of earth, thus favored yellow. The Xia clan used pine for their altar—the trees planted were those suited to the land. They invoked the spirit at the spring sacrifice—the Xia corresponded to the virtue of wood.

They buried their dead beside walls and placed *sha*—ornaments for the coffin’s outer shroud. Their music included *Xiaoyue*, *Jiucheng*, *Liuyi*, *Liulie*, and *Liuying*. *Jiucheng* means "nine transformations." *Liulie* refers to six rows of six. *Liuying* was Yu’s incorporation of Zhuanxu’s music. Their garments favored green. As they corresponded to the virtue of wood, they favored green.

The rites of the Yin people used stone for their altar—stone as the altar’s central marker. They sacrificed at the gate, offering the autumn sacrifice first to the gate, for the Yin corresponded to the virtue of metal. They planted pines at burials. Their music included *Dahu* and *Chenlu*—*Dahu* and *Chenlu* were music composed by Tang. Their garments favored white. As they corresponded to the virtue of metal, they favored white.

The rites of the Zhou people used chestnut for their altar. They sacrificed at the hearth, offering the summer sacrifice first to the hearth, for the Zhou corresponded to the virtue of fire. Master Zou said, "The sequence of my virtue’s succession will henceforth be unbroken." Thus, the Yu favored earth, the Xia wood, the Yin metal, and the Zhou fire. They buried their dead with cypress trees. Their music included *Dawu*, *Sanxiang*, and *Jixia*—*Sanxiang* and *Jixia* were martial music. Their garments favored red. As they corresponded to the virtue of fire, they favored red.

Though rites and music diverged and garment systems opposed one another, none failed to preserve the bonds of kinship or the order between high and low. Now, to cling to the statutes of a single ruler and condemn the customs of successive dynasties is like tuning a zither with glued pegs.

Thus, the enlightened ruler fashions rites and virtue into garments, divides conduct into regulated segments to form sashes. Garments suffice to cover the body, following the ancient canons, flexibly adapting, accommodating the body, suiting movement and gait—without pursuing bizarre elegance or meticulous tailoring. Sashes suffice to fasten and gather the lapels, binding securely and firmly—without haste to craft ornate, loosely woven shoes.

Therefore, to establish rites and virtue and practice utmost power is not to be constrained by the Confucians or Mohists. What is called "enlightened" does not mean seeing others but seeing oneself. What is called "keen" does not mean hearing others but hearing oneself. What is called "penetrating" does not mean knowing others but knowing oneself. Thus, the body is the vessel of the Dao; when the body embodies virtue, the Dao is attained.

When the Dao is attained, with it one sees clearly, hears keenly, speaks justly, and acts in accord. Thus, the sage regulates things as a craftsman carves and chisels, as a butcher cuts and divides—curving to fit what is fitting without breaking or harming. The clumsy craftsman does otherwise: too large, it jams and does not enter; too small, it is loose and does not encompass. Moving from the mind, branching through the hands, it grows ever uglier.

When the sage carves and shapes things, he splits and severs, separates and scatters them. Once excess or loss occurs, he re-measures with unity. Having exposed the root, he returns to the source. Having carved and polished, he reverts to simplicity. United, they become the Dao and virtue; divided, they become norms and standards. Their turning enters the mysterious darkness; their dispersion responds to the formless.

Rites, virtue, regulated conduct—how could these exhaust the root of perfect governance? Those in the world who understand affairs often depart from the root of the Dao and virtue, saying, "Rites and virtue suffice to govern the world." These are not those with whom one can discuss methods.

What are called rites and virtue are the statutes, records, customs, and traces of the Five Emperors and Three Kings—imprints of a single age. They are like the initial completion of straw dogs and clay dragons: straw dogs, bundles of straw shaped into dogs, used to seek blessings and atone for faults; clay dragons, used to pray for rain. Adorned with blue and yellow, draped in fine silks, wrapped in vermilion threads, with officiants in black robes—*jun*, pure garments; *xuan*, dark fasting robes—great officers in ceremonial caps—*duanmian*, caps—used to send and receive them. Yet once used, they become mere clods of earth and bundles of grass, discarded and unvalued.

Thus, in Shun’s time, the Miao people were disobedient. Thereupon, Shun cultivated governance, laid down arms, and danced with shields and axes. In Yu’s time, the world was drenched by great rains. Yu ordered the people to gather earth and pile firewood, taking refuge on hills and mounds. When King Wu attacked Zhou, he carried the corpse of his father and marched. When King Wu attacked Zhou, Boyi said, "His father died unburied, yet he takes up arms—can this be called filial?" The realm was not yet pacified, so he did not observe the three-year mourning period, which would have begun with King Wu.

Yu faced the disaster of floods, with tasks of embankments and ponds, so he buried the dead by evening if they died in the morning. These were all ways the sages responded to the times, adapting to circumstances, applying what was fitting upon seeing the form.

Now, to practice shield-and-axe dances while mocking the hoe and mattock—*jue*, a chopping tool—knowing that three years cannot be reduced to a day, is like following the ox while rejecting the horse, using feathers to mock arrows. To respond to transformation thus is no different from plucking a single string to harmonize with *Jixia*—*Jixia*, a musical stone. Plucking one string cannot complete the harmony.

To use the changes of a single age to match transformations and respond to the times is like wearing hemp in winter and fur in summer. A single sight cannot guide a hundred shots—*yi*, the sight of a crossbow. Shooting a hundred times, near and far cannot all be guided by one sight. A single garment cannot last through the year. Sights must correspond to high and low; garments must suit cold and heat.

Thus, when the world changes, affairs transform; when the times shift, customs alter. Therefore, the sage assesses the age to establish laws and follows the times to act. The ancient kings who ascended Mount Tai to perform feng sacrifices and Liangfu for shan sacrifices—over seventy sages—had differing systems of laws, not because they deliberately opposed one another, but because the times and ages differed.

Therefore, one does not model the laws that have succeeded but the principles by which laws are made. The principles by which laws are made are those that move with transformation. He who can move with transformation as a person—his highest value lies therein.

Thus, the songs of Huliang may be followed, but the reasons for their singing cannot be imitated. The laws of the sages may be observed, but the principles behind their creation cannot be traced.

Skilled debaters’ words may be heeded, yet the reasons for their speech cannot be delineated. A blunt and uniform sword may not be cherished, but the craft of Ou Leng is to be prized.

Now, Wang Qiao—Wang Qiao—was a man of Shu Wuyang who served as magistrate of Bo and attained the Dao to become an immortal. Chi Songzi—Chi Songzi—was a man of Shanggu who, afflicted by leprosy, entered the mountains to practice *daoyin* and levitation. Through exhalation and inhalation, expelling the old and drawing in the new, they cast off form and abandoned cunning, embraced simplicity, and returned to authenticity, roaming the mysterious and distant to ascend and commune with the clouded heavens.

If one today seeks to learn their Way yet fails to master the cultivation of *qi* and the nurturing of spirit, merely mimicking their exhalations and inhalations, their flexions and extensions, it is evident they cannot ride the clouds to ascend on high. *Jia* means "above."

The Five Emperors and Three Kings, who governed all under heaven with ease, refined the myriad things, equalized life and death, and harmonized with transformation, held the heart of the great sage to mirror the essence of all things. Above, they befriended the divine luminaries; below, they became one with creation.

If one today seeks to learn their Way yet fails to attain their clarity, luminosity, and profound sagacity, merely adhering to their statutes and ordinances, it is evident they cannot govern. Thus it is said: possessing ten sharp swords is not as good as mastering the craft of Ou Leng.

Possessing a hundred swift horses is not as good as mastering Bo Le’s art.

That which is most vast in simplicity has no form; the Way most subtle has no measure. Thus, the roundness of heaven cannot be compassed, nor the squareness of earth confined by a carpenter’s square. From ancient times to the present is called *zhou*; the four directions and above and below are called *yu*. The Way abides within them, yet none know its whereabouts.

Therefore, those whose vision is not far-reaching cannot be spoken to of greatness; those whose wisdom is not expansive cannot be discoursed with on ultimate truths.

Of old, Feng Yi attained the Way and dwelt in the great rivers. Feng Yi was the River Earl, a native of Titou Village in Tong Pass of Huayin, who consumed eight minerals and became a water immortal. Qian Qie attained the Way and resided on Kunlun. Qian Qie achieved the immortal’s path and ascended to dwell on Kunlun Mountain. Bian Que healed the sick—Bian Que was a man of Lu, named Qin Yueren, a contemporary of Viscount Jian of Zhao. Zaofu excelled in charioteering, Yi in archery, and Chui in carpentry—Chui was the master craftsman of Yao. Though their pursuits differed, the Way they followed was one.

Those who embrace the Way to comprehend things do not disparage one another. It is like irrigating fields from the same reservoir: the water they receive is equal. Now, when an ox is butchered and its meat cooked, some find it sour, others sweet; with simmering, roasting, and grilling, a thousand flavors arise, yet all derive from the body of a single ox. When fine trees like elm, cedar, catalpa, and camphor are felled and split—*pou* means to cleave, *li* to divide—some become coffins, others pillars or beams; though sawn, hewn, and planed—*pi* means to split, *bo* to strip the grain, *sui* to follow the grain—their uses are manifold, yet all stem from the simplicity of a single tree.

Thus, the hundred schools’ teachings may point in contrary directions, yet they converge in the Way as one. It is like the harmony of silk, bamboo, metal, and stone in music: though the melodies differ, they do not lose their essential form.

Bo Le, Han Feng, Qin Ya, and Guan Qing—these four were ancient masters of horse appraisal. Though their assessments varied, their knowledge of horses was one. Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, with their diverse statutes and methods, equally won the hearts of the people. When Tang entered Xia, he employed its laws; when King Wu entered Yin, he practiced its rites. What caused Jie and Zhou to perish was the very thing that enabled Tang and Wu to govern.

Thus, axes, chisels, saws, and files—without a skilled craftsman, they cannot shape wood. Furnaces, bellows, molds, and earthen forms—without a master smith, they cannot refine metal. The great butcher Tu Qi could dismember nine oxen in a single morning, yet his blade remained as keen as if it had shaved hair—*ti* means to sever like cutting hair. The cook Ding used his knife for nineteen years, yet it remained as if newly whetted from the grindstone—*xing* refers to the initial sharpening, *xing* to the whetstone. Why? Because he moved through the spaces between the sinews.

Now, compasses, squares, hooks, and plumb lines are tools of craftsmanship, but they are not craftsmanship itself. Thus, a zither without strings, though played by Master Wen, cannot produce a melody—Master Wen was a music master. With strings alone, it cannot evoke sorrow. Strings are the instruments of sorrow, but not sorrow itself.

As for the craftsman’s art of interlocking mechanisms, opening channels, sealing seclusions, and intricate interlacings—*lianji* refers to interlocking triggers, *yunkai* to mutual connections, *yinbi* to solitary closures, *xuan* to mutual entanglements—entering the profound obscurity of the subtle, the utmost refinement of divine harmony, moving through the spaces between hand and heart without boundary with things, even a father cannot teach this to his son. When a blind musician pours his intent into the instrument, capturing the spirit in dance and embodying it in the strings, even an elder brother cannot explain it to his younger brother.

Now, to make something level, one uses a level; to make it straight, a plumb line. But that which is neither bound by level nor plumb yet achieves perfect straightness and evenness—this is a peerless art. Thus, striking the *gong* note summons the *gong* response; plucking the *jue* note stirs the *jue*—this is resonance of like sounds. Yet when none of the five notes are played, and all twenty-five strings respond, this is an untransmitted Way.

Therefore, emptiness is the ruler of forms; stillness is the master of sounds. Subtle tones arise from stillness. In the world, right and wrong are never fixed; each age affirms what it affirms and denies what it denies. What is called right and wrong differs, for all deem themselves right and others wrong. From this perspective, what accords with oneself is not necessarily right; what arises in the heart is not necessarily wrong.

Thus, seeking rightness is not seeking the principle of the Way, but seeking what accords with oneself; rejecting wrongness is not eradicating depravity—*shi* means subtle crookedness—but rejecting what opposes the heart. What opposes me may not oppose others; what accords with me may not conform to custom. The utmost right has no wrong; the utmost wrong has no right—this is true right and wrong. But that which is right here and wrong there, wrong here and right there—this is called partial right and partial wrong. Such partial right and wrong are but fragments; true right and wrong encompass the cosmos.

Now, if I wish to choose right and abide in it, to choose wrong and discard it, I do not know which of the world’s so-called right and wrong is truly right or wrong. Laozi said, "Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish." For those who would be magnanimous: do not stir too often. For those who would be exacting: merely achieve the proper balance of salt and sour.

When Duke Ping of Jin spoke inappropriately, Music Master Kuang struck him with his zither, shattering the lapel of his robe against the palace wall—*dieren* means the zither struck the duke’s lapel, hitting the wall. His attendants wished to plaster the damaged wall.

Duke Ping said, "Let it be. Consider this my own fault."

When Confucius heard of this, he said, "The duke was not unharmed in body, yet he wished to encourage those who would remonstrate with him."

When Master Han heard of it—Master Han being Han Fei, the Lord of Han—he said, "When ministers commit breaches of ritual and are not punished, this is indulging transgression. There is reason indeed why Duke Ping failed to become a hegemon."

Thus, when a guest was introduced to Master Mi—Master Mi being Zijian—a guest of his, upon departing, Master Mi said, "Your guest committed three faults: gazing at me and laughing—this is insolence; speaking without choosing his words carefully—this is perversity; and discoursing deeply despite our shallow acquaintance—this is disorder."

The guest replied, "Gazing at you and laughing—this is openness; speaking without deferring to teachers—this is comprehension; and discoursing deeply despite our shallow acquaintance—this is loyalty."

Thus, the same demeanor of a guest may be deemed either that of a gentleman or a petty man, depending on one’s perspective. Therefore, when inclinations align, even loyal words deepen intimacy; when relations are distant, even sound counsel arouses suspicion.

A mother tending to her child’s scabbed scalp until blood flows to its ears—onlookers deem this the height of love. Were it a stepmother, passersby would call it malice. The nature of the act is the same; only the observer’s perspective differs.

From atop a city wall, an ox appears as small as a sheep, and a sheep as small as a pig—this is due to the height of one’s vantage. Gazing at one’s reflection in a basin of water, the face appears round; in a cup, it appears distorted. The face itself does not change; its roundness or distortion depends on the vessel from which it is viewed.

Now, though I may wish to rectify myself and engage with the world, how can I know from what perspective others view me? If I were to turn and contend with the world in its course, it would be like fleeing the rain—there is no place untouched by its damp. Constantly striving to remain in emptiness, one cannot achieve it; effort loses it, and grasping destroys it. As for one who does not strive for emptiness yet is naturally empty—this is the nature of spontaneity, what one admires yet cannot attain.

Thus, one who is attuned to the Dao is like a chariot’s axle: it does not move of itself yet, with the hub, travels a thousand miles, turning endlessly. One who is not attuned to the Dao is like one lost in confusion—though told of east and west, south and north, they remain bewildered. Even if they grasp a single corner, it is but a minor deviation, and soon they are lost again. Thus, they spend their lives enslaved to others, like a weather vane buffeted by the wind, never still for even a moment.

Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao and returns to their nature, not forcing transformation but awaiting its arising, not acting yet awaiting action—thus do they nearly evade the world’s difficulties.

The governance of a well-ordered age is easy to maintain: its affairs are simple to manage, its rituals easy to practice, and its obligations easy to fulfill. Thus, people do not hold multiple offices, nor do offices entail multiple duties. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are distinguished by village and region.

Therefore, farmers speak with farmers of labor, scholars with scholars of conduct, artisans with artisans of skill, and merchants with merchants of profit. Thus, scholars do not neglect their conduct, farmers do not abandon their work, artisans do not struggle with their tasks, and merchants do not suffer losses in goods. Each abides in their nature, undisturbed by others.

When Yi Yin mobilized earthworks, he assigned those with sturdy shins to wield hoes, and those with long legs to tread and tamp deeply. Those with strong backs carried soil, and those with crooked eyes leveled the ground, for their gaze was not straight. Those who were hunchbacked plastered walls, for their stooped posture suited the task. Each was assigned according to their aptitude, and thus human nature was made equal.

The Hu people are skilled with horses, the Yue people with boats—though their forms and kinds differ, their tasks are exchanged with difficulty. Losing their proper place, they are deemed inferior; gaining advantage, they are esteemed. The sage encompasses and employs them all, for their principle is one.

Foresight and far-reaching vision, the ability to see a thousand miles—these are the heights of human talent, yet a well-ordered age does not demand them of the people. Vast learning and retentive memory, eloquence and ready speech—these are the finest of human intelligence, yet a wise ruler does not seek them from his subjects. Disdaining worldly things and remaining unsullied by custom—this is the noble conduct of the scholar, yet a well-ordered age does not make it the model for the people. Hidden mechanisms and concealed workings, craftsmanship without trace—these are the marvels of human skill, yet a well-ordered age does not make them the people’s occupation.

Thus, Chang Hong and Music Master Kuang, who foresaw fortune and misfortune and spoke without error, could not share office with the multitude. Gongsun Long, who debated with unyielding words, distinguished sameness and difference, and separated hardness and whiteness—his white and horse could not be united as one, but were divided into two—could not share the same path with the multitude.

The Northern Recluse Wuze condemned Shun and cast himself into the icy abyss—not because Shun’s virtue had declined, but because such an act could not serve as a model for the age. Lu Ban and Mozi fashioned wooden kites that flew for three days without landing, yet they could not be employed as artisans. Thus, what is too lofty to attain cannot be made the measure of men; conduct too exalted to emulate cannot be made the custom of the state.

The sage does not employ one whose hand never errs in weighing the lightest or heaviest, but hangs them upon the steelyard; the enlightened ruler does not entrust one whose eye never misjudges height or depth by even a hair’s breadth, but seeks it in the level of still water. Why? Because human talent cannot be monopolized, while measures and standards may be passed down through generations.

Thus, a well-ordered state may be maintained by the dull-witted, while military strategy may be wielded with flexibility. If one waited for *Yaoniao* and *Feitu*—horses that gallop a thousand *li* in a day—before riding, then no one in the world would ever mount a chariot. If one waited for Xishi or Maoqiang before taking a wife, then one would remain unmarried for life. Yet it is not that one must await the heroes of antiquity before men feel content—rather, one makes use of what is already at hand.

The thousand-*li* steed *Qiji* covers the distance in a single day; the sluggish nag, though traveling ten stages, also arrives in ten days. Thus it is evident that human talent cannot be relied upon exclusively, while the Dao and its arts may be universally practiced.

In an age of chaos, the law sets lofty standards yet fails to punish transgressions; it imposes heavy burdens yet cannot enforce penalties; it establishes perilous prohibitions yet dares not execute the guilty. When the people are oppressed by these three demands, they feign wisdom to deceive their superiors and commit wrongs to seek advantage. Thus, even with harsh laws and severe punishments, their treachery cannot be suppressed. Why? Because their strength is insufficient.

Hence the proverb: "When a bird is desperate, it pecks; when a beast is desperate, it claws; when a man is desperate, he deceives." This is what it means.

The discourse on the Dao and virtue is like the sun and moon: whether south of the Yangtze or north of the Yellow River, none can alter its course; though one gallops a thousand *li*, its position remains unchanged. But the pursuit or abandonment of rites and customs is like the dwelling of a house: what the eastern neighbor calls west, the western neighbor calls east—even if Gao Yao were to adjudicate, he could not fix its place. Thus, when inclinations align, praise or blame depends on custom; when intentions and conduct are equal, success or failure rests with the times.

Tang and Wu accumulated virtuous deeds through long practice—this may be emulated; yet their encounter with the eras of Jie and Zhou was a bestowal of Heaven. Now, though one may possess the aspirations of Tang and Wu, without the times of Jie and Zhou, to seek the achievement of hegemonic or royal enterprise is scarcely possible.

Of old, King Wu wielded the dagger-axe and grasped the halberd to conquer Zhou and vanquish Yin; then, girding his tablet and bearing the *shu*-staff, he ascended the court. The *shu* is a wooden staff. After King Wu’s passing, the people of Yin rebelled. The Duke of Zhou entered the Eastern Palace—the Eastern Palace being the residence of the crown prince—stepped upon the mounting stone (by which the sovereign ascends his chariot), assumed the Son of Heaven’s throne, and, with the screen at his back, received the feudal lords. The space between door and window is called the *yi*. He exiled the Cai Duke, executed the Guan Duke—both elder brothers of the Duke of Zhou—subdued the remnants of Yin (the remnants of Yin being Lu Fu, son of Zhou), and offered sacrifices to King Wen in the Hall of Light. After seven years, he returned the government to King Cheng.

King Wu first employed martial power, then civil governance—not that his intent had altered, but that he responded to the times. The Duke of Zhou exiled his brother and executed his kin—not that he lacked benevolence, but that he rectified disorder. Thus, when affairs accord with the age, merit is accomplished; when endeavors align with the times, renown is established.

Of old, Duke Huan of Qi assembled the feudal lords with war chariots, then returned to punish within his state with axe and halberd. Duke Wen of Jin gathered the feudal lords with leather-bound chariots, then retired to govern his state with rites and righteousness. Duke Huan was first yielding, then firm; Duke Wen was first firm, then yielding. Yet their commands prevailed throughout the realm, and their authority over the feudal lords was equal—for they discerned the shifts of circumstance.

Yan He, when the Lord of Lu sought to appoint him as minister, refused. Though envoys were sent with gifts to precede him, he broke through the wall at the rear of his house and fled, becoming renowned throughout the world as a *wu*. Among the people of Chu, a knight is called *wu*. Had he encountered Shang Yang or Shen Buhai, his punishment would have extended to three clans—how much more to himself.

The world often extols the ancients and exalts their conduct, yet when contemporaries possess the same qualities, it fails to esteem them—not because their talent is inferior, but because the times are unsuited. Thus, six fine steeds or a team of swift *jueti* (the *jueti* being the finest horses of the northern Di) may cross the Yangtze or the Yellow River, yet they are less effective than a hollowed-out log—so it is with navigating the world.

Therefore, those who establish merit are sparing in action yet scrupulous in timing. Now, the vulgar of this age deem those who achieve merit worthy, those who overcome adversity wise, those who encounter calamity foolish, and those who die for principle obstinate. I hold that each merely attains the utmost of their own nature.

Prince Bigan was no less wise than Jizi, who feigned madness and let his hair loose to preserve himself; yet Bigan delighted in upright conduct and exhausting loyalty unto death, and thus did not act otherwise. Boyi and Shuqi were no less capable of accepting emolument and office to accomplish their aims; yet they delighted in departing from the world and maintaining lofty conduct to cut themselves off from the multitude, and thus did not pursue such ends. Xu You and Shan Juan were no less able to pacify the world and bring tranquility within the seas to govern the people with virtue; yet they felt shame at having their harmony disturbed by external things, and thus refused. Yu Rang and Yao Li were no less aware of the joys of family and the comfort of wife and children to live in ease; yet they delighted in offering utmost sincerity and acting with unwavering loyalty to their lords unto death, and thus did not linger.

Now, to view Bigan from Jizi’s perspective is to deem him foolish; to view Jizi from Bigan’s perspective is to deem him base.

Viewing Boyi from the perspective of Guan Zhong and Yan Ying is to deem him affected; viewing Guan Zhong and Yan Ying from Boyi’s perspective is to deem them avaricious. Their paths diverge in reproach, their desires stand in opposition, yet each delights in their own pursuit—who then shall set them right?

Master Zeng said: "Strike a boat upon the water, and birds hearing it soar high, while fish hearing it plunge deep." Thus, though their courses differ, each finds its own advantage.

When Master Hui crossed Meng Marsh with a hundred chariots in train—Master Hui, named Shi, served as minister of Liang, yet his ambition remained unfulfilled even with a hundred chariots at his command—Master Zhuang, seeing this, cast aside his surplus fish. Master Zhuang, named Zhou, a man of Meng, lived in reclusion and took no office; seeing Hui Shi’s insufficiency, he discarded his excess catch.

The pelican drinks several *dou* of water yet remains unsatisfied; the pelican, a marsh-dwelling bird. The eel and sturgeon perish at the mere touch of dew upon their lips. The eel and sturgeon, names of fish.

Zhi Bo possessed the lands of the Three Jin yet still craved more—Three Jin: Zhi Bo held the territories of Fan and Zhonghang. His desires knew no bounds.

Lin Lei and Rong Qigi dressed in garments like hanging rags—Lin Lei and Rong Qigi, both reclusive worthies—yet their hearts held no resentment. *Resentment: dissatisfaction.*

From this we see: each pursues a different path, so why should they condemn one another? Those who value life do not harm themselves for gain; those who uphold integrity do not evade hardship for convenience; those who covet office do not spare their bodies for profit; and those who crave fame do not seize what is unjust. These positions, when debated, are like ice and charcoal, hook and plumb line—when could they ever align? Yet if we take the sage as the measure, he encompasses and unites them all, leaving no room for right or wrong.

The flying bird seeks its nest; the fox and badger seek their dens. The nest, once built, becomes a place of rest; the den, once dug, becomes a place of shelter. The choices one makes and the principles one follows are likewise where a person finds refuge—each delights in what brings peace, each attains what suits their nature, and this is called becoming fully human. Thus, when judged by the Dao, all are gathered and made equal.

The way to govern a state: the ruler issues no harsh decrees, officials engage in no frivolous governance, scholars do not feign benevolence, artisans produce no excessive craft. Affairs proceed in order without disturbance; tools remain whole without ornament. In a disordered age, it is not so. Those who act virtuously vie to outdo one another in loftiness; those who practice ritual vie in pretense. Chariots and carriages reach extremes of carving and inlay; vessels and implements hasten toward intricate engraving. Those who seek wealth contend over what is rare to make it precious; those who disparage refinement dwell in chaos to prove their cleverness. They vie in sophistry, accumulating without resolution, contributing nothing to governance. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete them, yet they serve no practical use.

Thus the laws of Shennong state: If a man in his prime does not plow, someone in the world will go hungry. If a woman in her prime does not weave, someone in the world will suffer cold. Therefore, he tilled the fields himself, his wife wove with her own hands, setting the example for all under heaven. In guiding the people, he did not prize rare goods or esteem useless objects. Thus, those who did not exert themselves in farming had no means to sustain life; those who did not exert themselves in learning had no means to clothe their bodies. Surplus and deficiency each returned to the self. With clothing and food abundant, deceit and wrongdoing did not arise. In peace and contentment, with no disturbances, the world was balanced and equitable. Thus, even Confucius and Zeng Shen had no occasion to display their goodness, while Meng Ben and Cheng Jing had no chance to wield their might. *Cheng Jing: an ancient warrior.*

The customs of a declining age rely on cunning, deceit, and pretense to adorn what is useless. They value distant goods and treasure rare wealth, neglecting what sustains life. They thin the world’s purity—*thin: to diminish; purity: sincerity*—and split its simplicity, penning oxen and horses to serve as livestock. They confuse the people, turning clarity into murk, scattering their natures and lives in restless pursuit. Loyalty and trust dissolve; people lose their true essence.

Then, jadeite, rhinoceros horn, ivory, and embroidered patterns dazzle the eyes; fine meats, millet, and fragrant delicacies from Jing and Wu glut the mouth—*Jing and Wu: states; fragrant delicacies: rare flavors; glut: insatiable desire.* Bells, drums, flutes, panpipes, strings, and chimes intoxicate the ears. The choices one makes, the principles one follows, rituals, and slanderous debates occupy the mind. Thus the people boil in chaos, pursuing profit by night, entangled in frivolity and shallowness—*shallowness: superficiality.* As shallowness grows, so too does the erosion of virtue. Law and righteousness oppose each other; conduct and profit stand in contradiction. Even ten Guan Zhongs could not govern such a world.

Moreover, the rich ride in carriages adorned with embroidered silk, their horses draped in tassels of yak and elephant tail. Their curtains and mats are woven with patterned ribbons, green and yellow intertwined in designs beyond description. The poor, in summer, wear coarse cloth bound with rope, filling their bellies with beans and water to endure the heat. In winter, their sheepskin robes fall apart at the seams—*fall apart: the fur unravels*—their short garments fail to cover their bodies, and they warm themselves at the stove’s mouth. *Warm: to toast.* Thus, though they are registered households of equal standing, the gap between rich and poor is as vast as that between a ruler and a simple prisoner—beyond comparison.

Those who ride the waves of strange skills and deceitful schemes may thrive for a time, but those who uphold integrity, cultivate principle, and refuse ill-gotten gains cannot escape hunger and cold. Yet to urge the people to abandon the peripheral and return to the fundamental is like dredging the source while damming the flow.

Carving and inlay harm farming; embroidery and patterned weaving injure women’s work. When farming is abandoned and women’s work is harmed, hunger and cold take root. When hunger and cold converge, no one since ancient times has avoided breaking the law or incurring punishment.

Thus, whether one prospers or suffers depends on the times, not on conduct; profit and harm lie in fate, not in wisdom. A routed army’s soldiers, though brave, flee in panic, and their general cannot stop them. A victorious army’s ranks, though cowardly, march to their deaths, for fear prevents them from fleeing. When the Yangtze or Yellow River bursts its banks and floods a village, fathers and sons, brothers and kin abandon one another in flight, scrambling up hills and slopes, the swiftest reaching high ground first, unable to look back. Yet when the world is at peace and the heart is content, one pities even a drowning stranger in a neighboring state—how much more so a relative? Thus, when the self is secure, kindness extends even to distant lands, and personal concerns fade. When the self is in peril, one forgets even kin, and no one can dispel this.

A traveler cannot save a drowning man, for his hands and feet are otherwise occupied. One burned cannot rescue another from fire, for their own body is in pain. When the people have surplus, they yield; when they lack, they fight. Yielding gives rise to ritual and righteousness; fighting gives rise to violence and chaos. Knock on a door to beg for water, and none will refuse—because there is abundance. In the forest, firewood is not sold; by the lake, fish are not peddled—because there is surplus.

Thus, when resources abound, desires diminish, and when needs are met, strife ceases. In the time of the Qin king, there was a man who, upon the birth of his son, pickled and killed him—because there was not enough to sustain them. When the House of Liu held power (referring to the Han), a lone man would take in orphans—because wealth was in surplus.

Therefore, in an age of order, even petty men uphold governance, and profit cannot tempt them; in an age of chaos, even gentlemen turn to treachery, and the law cannot restrain them.

**The Dao in Application**

The Dao in its movement—things respond as it acts. By examining fortune and misfortune, one may verify its signs.

The Supreme Clarity (Taiqing) asked the Boundless (Wuqiong), "Do you know the Dao?"
Taiqing refers to the purest of primordial qi.
The Boundless, being formless, replied, "I do not know."

Taiqing then asked the Non-Action (Wuwei), "Do you know the Dao?"
Non-Action, though having form, does not act.
Non-Action said, "I know the Dao."
Since Non-Action has form, it knows the Dao.

Taiqing asked, "In your knowing of the Dao, are there principles?"
Non-Action said, "There are principles to my knowing."
"What are these principles?"
Non-Action said, "What I know of the Dao can be weak, can be strong, can be yielding, can be unyielding, can be yin, can be yang, can be obscure, can be luminous, can envelop heaven and earth, can respond to the boundless without fixed direction. These are the principles by which I know the Dao."

Taiqing further inquired of the Unbegun (Wushi), "Earlier, I asked the Boundless about the Dao, and it said, 'I do not know.' I then asked Non-Action, and it said, 'I know the Dao.' I asked, 'Does your knowing of the Dao have principles?' Non-Action said, 'There are principles.' I asked, 'What are these principles?' Non-Action replied, 'What I know of the Dao can be weak, can be strong, can be yielding, can be unyielding, can be yin, can be yang, can be obscure, can be luminous, can envelop heaven and earth, can respond to the boundless without fixed direction—these are the principles by which I know the Dao.' If this is so, then between Non-Action’s knowing and the Boundless’s not knowing, which is correct and which is mistaken?"

The Unbegun said, "Not knowing penetrates deeply, while knowing remains shallow. Not knowing reaches within, while knowing stays without. Not knowing grasps the essence, while knowing grasps only the coarse."

Taiqing looked up and sighed, "Then is not knowing true knowing? Is knowing true not knowing? Who can discern that knowing is not knowing, and not knowing is knowing?"

The Unbegun said, "The Dao cannot be heard; what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen; what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken; what is spoken is not it. Who can comprehend the formless within form?"

Thus, Laozi said, "When all under heaven recognize goodness as goodness, this is not goodness." Therefore, those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.

Bai Gong asked Confucius, "Can one speak in subtle words?"
Bai Gong was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. After Jian was killed, Bai Gong harbored resentment and sought vengeance, hence his question about subtle words.
Confucius did not respond, knowing Bai Gong harbored secret schemes.

Bai Gong said, "If two people throw a stone into water, what then?"
Confucius replied, "A skilled diver from Wu or Yue could retrieve it."
Bai Gong asked, "If one pours water into water, what then?"
Confucius said, "The waters of Zi and Mian blend together; Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them."
Zi and Mian were two rivers in Qi.

Bai Gong said, "Then is it truly impossible to speak in subtle words?"
Confucius replied, "Why would it be impossible? But who can be called one who knows the meaning of words? The one who knows the meaning of words does not speak with words. Not speaking with words, the heart knows. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the highest words transcend words; the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial."

Bai Gong did not grasp this and later died in the bathhouse.
The men of Chu killed Bai Gong in the bathhouse.

Thus, Laozi said, "Words have their source; affairs have their master. It is only because of ignorance that they do not understand me." This refers to Bai Gong.

Master Hui drafted laws for King Hui of Liang.
King Hui was King Hui of Liang; Master Hui was Hui Shi.
Once completed, he showed them to the scholars, who all praised them. He presented them to King Hui, who was greatly pleased and showed them to Di Jian, who said, "Good."

King Hui asked, "If it is good, can it be implemented?"
Di Jian said, "It cannot."
King Hui asked, "If it is good yet cannot be implemented, why is that?"
Di Jian replied, "When lifting a great beam, those in front shout 'heave-ho,' and those behind respond—this is the song of those lifting heavy loads to encourage effort. Are there no tunes from Zheng or Wei, or the stirring melodies of Chu? Yet they are not used because they are not as fitting as this. Thus, what is most suitable is not always what is most refined."

Governing a state lies in ritual, not in ornate rhetoric. Thus Laozi said: "The more laws and decrees are proclaimed, the more thieves and bandits arise"—this is what he meant.

Tian Pian expounded the Dao and its arts to the King of Qi. (Tian Pian was a man of Qi and a minister to the king.) The king responded, saying, "What I possess is the state of Qi. The Dao and its arts are difficult to employ in eliminating troubles—what I wish to hear is the governance of the state."

Tian Pian replied, "My words contain no governance, yet they can become governance. It is like a forest that contains no timber, yet can become timber. I hope Your Majesty will examine what I mean and take the governance of Qi into your own hands. Though it may not eliminate troubles, within the space between heaven and earth, within the six directions, all things can be molded and transformed. Why trouble yourself with the governance of Qi alone?"

This is what Lao Dan called "the formless form, the imageless image." What Your Majesty asks about is Qi; what I speak of is timber. Timber does not surpass the forest, the forest does not surpass the rain, and only after rain does timber grow. Rain does not surpass yin and yang, yin and yang do not surpass harmony, and harmony does not surpass the Dao. The Dao is the root from which all things arise.

When Bai Gong Sheng seized the state of Jing, he could not bring himself to distribute its treasuries to others. (Bai Gong usurped the state of Chu, coveting its resources without sharing them. He held power for seven days.) On the seventh day, Shi Yi entered and said, (Shi Yi was a partisan of Bai Gong.) "To gain it unjustly and then fail to distribute it is to invite disaster. If you cannot give it to others, it would be better to burn it, lest others harm you." Bai Gong did not heed him.

On the ninth day, the Viscount of Ye entered. (The Viscount of Ye was Zigao, a grandee of Chu, who came from beyond Fangcheng and killed Bai Gong.) He opened the great treasury to distribute its goods to the people, brought forth the weapons from the high armories to equip the populace, and then attacked. On the nineteenth day, he captured Bai Gong. (The Viscount of Ye killed Bai Gong.)

A state is not one’s own to possess, yet to desire possession of it is the height of greed. To be unable to act for others and to have no means of acting for oneself is the height of folly. How does Bai Gong’s miserliness differ from the owl’s love for its young? When the owl’s young grow, they devour their mother.

Thus Laozi said: "To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping; to hammer and sharpen it cannot be preserved for long."

Viscount Jian of Zhao designated Xiangzi as his heir. Dong Yanzi said, "Wu Xu is of low birth." (Dong Yanzi was a minister of the Zhao clan. Wu Xu was Xiangzi’s name, a son of Viscount Jian by a concubine.) "Why do you now make him your heir?"

Viscount Jian said, "This man can endure humiliation for the sake of the altars of soil and grain." (Xiangzi was yielding and could endure shame.)

Later, Zhi Bo drank with Xiangzi and struck Xiangzi’s head. The grandees requested permission to kill Zhi Bo, but Xiangzi said, "When my late lord established me, he said I could endure humiliation for the altars of soil and grain. He did not say I could stab others."

Ten months later, Zhi Bo besieged Xiangzi at Jinyang. Xiangzi divided his troops and attacked. (Dividing his forces, he struck with his companies. A *dui* consisted of two hundred soldiers.)

The forces of Zhi Bo were utterly defeated, and Xiangzi had his skull made into a drinking vessel. Thus Laozi said, "Know the masculine, but hold to the feminine, and you will be a valley to all under heaven."

Nie Que asked the Way of Pi Yi. (Nie Que and Pi Yi were both elders of the time of Yao.) Pi Yi said, "Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirits will come to dwell. Virtue will come to cling to you like beauty, and the Dao will take up its abode in you. Be dull as a newly born calf, and seek nothing from the past."

Before the words were finished, Nie Que continued with Chou Yi. Chou Yi stared fixedly without speaking. Pi Yi departed, singing as he went: "Your form is like withered bones, your heart like dead ashes. Truly, knowing nothing, you hold fast to this. Vast and boundless, with no mind to scheme—what manner of man is he?"

Thus Laozi said, "Illumined and penetrating in the four directions, can you do so without knowledge?"

Xiangzi of Zhao attacked the Di and captured the cities of Youren and Zhongren. (Youren and Zhongren were two towns of the Di.) An envoy came to announce the victory, but Xiangzi, who was about to eat, wore a troubled expression. His attendants said, "In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord look troubled?" Xiangzi said, "The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River lasts no more than three days before subsiding. A whirlwind or violent rain does not last even a full day. Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have no accumulation, yet in a single morning two cities have fallen—will destruction not soon reach me?"

When Confucius heard of this, he said, "The Zhao house will flourish! For anxiety is the means to flourishing, while joy is the means to destruction. Victory is not the difficult part. The worthy ruler holds fast to victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once achieved victory, yet in the end they perished, for they did not understand how to hold fast to victory. Only the lord who possesses the Way can hold fast to victory."

Confucius could pull open the gate-bar of the state gate of Guo (the bar was drawn upward, and pulling it open was difficult), yet he was unwilling to be known for his strength. Mozi devised defenses against siege engines, and Gongshu Ban was subdued, yet Mozi was unwilling to be known for his military knowledge. (Though Mozi was skilled in warfare, he was unwilling to be known for his knowledge of it.)

The one who is good at holding fast to victory makes the strong appear weak. Thus Laozi said, "The Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted."

Hui Meng sought an audience with King Kang of Song. Stamping his foot and clearing his throat, he spoke rapidly: "I, your servant, have heard that what Your Majesty delights in is courage and achievement, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction does the guest have for me?" Hui Meng replied, "I have a method here: though a man be brave, you may stab him and not pierce him; though he be skillful and strong, you may strike him and not hit him. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of this?"

The King of Song said, "Excellent! This is what I wish to hear."

Hui Meng said, "To stab and not pierce, to strike and not hit—this is still humiliation. I have a method here: though a man be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he be strong, he will not dare to strike. That they do not dare to stab or strike is not because they lack the intention. I have a method here: to make them fundamentally lack the intention. Lacking the intention, they will have no thought of love or profit. I have a method here: to make all the men and women under heaven joyfully desire to love and profit you. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four accumulations. These four matters, though burdensome to the world, are such that no man or woman does not joyfully regard them as supreme. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of this?"

The King of Song said, "This is what I desire to obtain."

Hui Meng replied, "Confucius and Mozi are such men. Kong Qiu and Mo Di became lords without land, leaders without office. Becoming lords without land—this is wealth through the Dao. Becoming leaders without office—this is honor through virtue. Not a man or woman under heaven does not crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, wishing to bring them peace and profit. Now, Your Majesty is lord of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess this aspiration, then within your four borders, all will receive its benefit. This surpasses Confucius and Mozi by far."

The King of Song had no reply. After Hui Meng departed, the king said to his attendants, "How eloquent! The guest has bested me with his persuasion."

Thus Laozi said, "To be brave in not daring is to live." From this we see that great courage is in truth no courage at all.

In former times, Yao’s nine ministers were Yu, Gaoyao, Ji, Xie, Boyi, Chui, Yi, Kui, and Long. Shun’s seven ministers were all the same as Yao’s, save that he employed seven of them. King Wu’s five ministers were the Duke of Zhou, the Duke of Shao, the Grand Duke, the Duke of Bi, and the Duke of Mao. Yao, Shun, and King Wu, though they had nine, seven, and five ministers respectively, could not attend to a single matter themselves. Yet they sat with folded arms and received success—so skillful were they in riding the resources of others.

Thus, when a man races a steed on foot, he cannot outrun it; but when he mounts a chariot, the steed cannot outrun him. In the north there is a beast called the *cu*. Its front is like a rat and its rear like a hare. The rat’s front legs are short, the hare’s hind legs are long, and so it is called the *cu*. When it hastens, it stumbles; when it runs, it falls. It is always taken by the *qiongqiong* and *juju*, which bring it sweet grass. The *qiongqiong* and *juju* have long front legs and short hind legs, so they can run swiftly over hollows but cannot climb. When the *cu* is in distress, it quickly measures the *juju* and flees upon its back. Thus it entrusts what it cannot do to those with the ability.

Therefore Laozi said, "He who takes the place of a great carpenter in hewing risks injuring his hand."

Bo Yi persuaded Duke Si of Wei with the art of kingship. Duke Si, lord of the state of Wei, replied, "What I possess is a thousand chariots. I wish to use love to teach."

Bo Yi said, "Wu Huo could lift a thousand *jun*—how much more a single *jin*?"

Du He persuaded Duke Zhao of Zhou to pacify the realm. Duke Zhao, as the Zhou dynasty declined and split into east and west, each setting up its own lord, said to Du He, "I wish to learn how to pacify Zhou."

Du He replied, "If what I say is not acceptable, I cannot pacify Zhou. If what I say is acceptable, Zhou will be at peace of itself. This is what is called 'pacifying without pacifying.'"

Thus Laozi said, "Great regulation requires no carving, and so the pursuit of many chariots results in no chariots."

By the law of Lu, if a man of Lu was made a concubine in another state and someone ransomed her, he could claim silver from the treasury. Zigong ransomed a man of Lu from another state but declined the silver when he returned. Confucius said, "Ci has erred. When the sage undertakes a matter, it is to shift customs and change habits, and to establish teachings that can be passed down to later generations—not merely to suit his own conduct. Now, the rich in the state are few and the poor are many. If one ransoms and accepts silver, he is not upright; if he does not accept silver, he will not ransom others again. From now on, no man of Lu will ransom others from other states."

Thus Laozi said, "To see the small is called clarity."

Duke Wu of Wei asked Li Ke—Li Ke, the duke’s minister—"Why did Wu perish?"

Li Ke replied, "They fought many battles and won many victories."

The duke said, "Many battles and many victories are a state’s blessing. Why then did it alone perish?"

Li Ke replied, "Many battles exhaust the people; many victories make the ruler arrogant. To have an arrogant ruler command an exhausted people—few states in the world do not perish thus. Arrogance leads to indulgence; indulgence leads to excess. Exhaustion leads to resentment; resentment leads to extreme scheming. When both above and below reach extremes, Wu’s destruction was still late. This is why Fuchai cut his own throat at Gansui. When Yue prepared its attack, this is why Fuchai killed himself."

Thus Laozi said, "When merit is achieved and fame is attained, withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven."

Yu Yue wished to persuade Duke Huan of Qi but was destitute and could find no way to reach him. So he became a merchant, loading his cart—*ren* means "to load," as in the *Odes*: "I load, I pull." He traveled as a merchant to Qi and lodged outside the outer gate at dusk. Duke Huan was welcoming guests in the suburbs. That night, he asked the gatekeeper to open for a loaded cart. The torches were bright—*jue* means "torch"—and his retinue was large. Ning Yue was feeding his ox beneath the cart. Seeing Duke Huan, he grew sorrowful, struck the ox’s horn, and sang a merchant’s song with urgency.

Duke Huan heard it and clasped his attendant’s hand, saying, "How strange! The singer is no ordinary man." He ordered his rear carriage to carry him. When Duke Huan arrived, his attendants asked permission to present him. The duke gave him robes and a cap and received him. He spoke of ordering the realm, and Duke Huan was greatly pleased and wished to employ him. His ministers objected, saying, "The guest is a man of Wei. Wei is not far from Qi. Your Lordship should send someone to inquire about him. If he is truly worthy, it is not too late to employ him."

Duke Huan said, "Not so. To inquire is to risk discovering minor faults. To forget a man’s great virtue because of minor faults—this is how rulers lose the worthies of the world. In all listening, there must be verification. To listen once and not inquire again is to match the reason for it. Matching one’s own comprehensive understanding, this is how to employ him. Moreover, men are inherently difficult to match. One should weigh their strengths and employ them accordingly."

In this matter, Duke Huan succeeded.

Thus Laozi said: "Heaven is great, Earth is great, the Dao is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them." This speaks of his capacity to embrace them all.

King Tai of Zhou dwelt in Bin, and the Di people attacked him. He offered them furs, silks, pearls, and jades, but they refused, saying, "What the Di people seek is land, not wealth." King Tai said, "To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to live with a man’s father and kill his son—this I will not do. Let all strive to remain here." He continued, "If I make them my subjects, how would they differ from the Di? Moreover, I have heard that one should not harm what nourishes by means of what is nourished." He took up his staff and departed, and the people followed him in a continuous stream. Thus he established a state beneath Mount Qi. Mount Qi is today’s northern Meiyang. Below it lay the lands of Zhou, and from this the realm took its name.

King Tai of Zhou may be said to have known how to preserve life. Though rich and noble, he did not let nourishment harm his person; though poor and lowly, he did not let profit burden his form. Now, if one receives the ranks and emoluments of one’s ancestors, one must greatly fear losing them. They have come down from long ago—how could one lightly cast them aside? Is this not delusion?

Thus Laozi said: "He who values his person above all under heaven may be entrusted with the world; he who cherishes his person above all under heaven may be charged with the world."

Prince Mou of Zhongshan, a state of the Xianyu, said to Master Zhan, "Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart remains beneath the palace gates. What can be done about this?" By "rivers and seas," he meant loyalty resided in his own person; by "palace gates," he meant inner vigilance.

Master Zhan replied, "Value life. To value life is to slight profit. Valuing life is the nature of the self."

Prince Mou of Zhongshan said, "Though I know this, I still cannot overcome myself."

[Master Zhan said, "If you cannot overcome yourself,] then follow your inclinations. Following them, the spirit will have no resentment." This means that if one cannot conquer one’s passions and desires, one should indulge the heart’s intent, and then one’s spirit will harbor no grievance. But if one cannot overcome oneself and yet forcibly resists, this is called a doubly wounded person—no such one belongs to the long-lived.

Thus Laozi said: "To know harmony is called constancy; to know constancy is called clarity. To augment life is called auspicious; to let the heart command the qi is called force. Therefore, use your light and return to your clarity."

King Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, "How should one govern the state?"

Zhan He replied, "Why is it that you are clear about governing the self but unclear about governing the state?"

The king said, "I have been granted the ancestral temples and altars of the soil and grain. I wish to learn how to preserve them."

Zhan He replied, "I have never heard of a man whose person was well-ordered yet whose state was in chaos, nor of one whose person was in chaos yet whose state was well-ordered. Therefore, the root lies in the self—how dare I respond with the branches?"

The king said, "Well said."

Thus Laozi said: "In cultivating the self, one’s virtue becomes true."

Duke Huan was reading in the hall. Below the hall, a wheelwright was hewing a wheel. Setting aside his hammer and chisel, he asked the duke, "What book is Your Lordship reading?"

Duke Huan said, "The books of the sages."

The wheelwright said, "Are those sages still alive?"

Duke Huan said, "They are already dead."

The wheelwright said, "Then what you are reading is merely the dregs of the sages."

"Dregs" refers to the lees of wine; "dregs" here means the spent essence after the wine has been pressed.

Duke Huan flushed with anger and said, "I am reading—how dare a craftsman mock me? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you will die."

The wheelwright said, "Very well, I have an explanation. I shall speak from my experience in hewing wheels. If I work too swiftly, the result is bitter and does not penetrate; if too slowly, it is cloying and does not hold fast. Not too swiftly, not too slowly—responding to the hand, satisfying the heart—this is how one attains the subtlest skill. Yet I cannot teach this to my son, nor can my son learn it from me. Thus I am sixty years old and still hewing wheels. Now, what the sages have said is likewise what they carried in their hearts. When they were exhausted and died, only their dregs remained."

Thus Laozi said: "A Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; a name that can be named is not the constant name."

Formerly, Zihan, Minister of Works, served as chief minister to the ruler of Song. He said to the lord of Song, "Whether the state is in danger or safety, whether the people are well-ordered or in chaos, depends on how Your Lordship administers rewards and punishments. Titles, rewards, and bestowals are what the people desire—let Your Lordship personally grant them. Executions and punishments are what the people resent—let your minister bear the responsibility."

The lord of Song said, "Well said. I shall enjoy the praise, and you shall bear the resentment. I know I shall not be laughed at by the feudal lords."

The people of the state all knew that the power over life and death lay with Zihan. The great ministers grew close to him, and the common people feared him. Before a full year had passed, Zihan had deposed the lord of Song and monopolized his government.

Thus Laozi said: "Fish cannot be taken from the depths; the state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others."

Wang Shou was carrying books as he walked when he encountered Xu Feng in Zhou. Wang Shou was an ancient lover of books; Xu Feng was a recluse of Zhou.

Xu Feng said, "Affairs respond to change and move accordingly. Change arises from the times, so one who knows the times has no constant course. Books are where words come from. Words come from knowledge, and the knowledgeable store up books."

Thereupon Wang Shou burned his books and danced with joy.

Thus Laozi said: "Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; it is better to hold to the center."

Lingyin Zipei requested to host a drinking feast for King Zhuang. Zipei was the chief minister of King Zhuang of Chu. "Requested to host" means he asked to prepare wine.

King Zhuang consented.

Zipei stepped back, bowed with hands clasped, and stood facing north at the foot of the palace steps. "Stepped back" means he retreated barefoot. "Bowed" means he raised his hands in salute.

He said, "Formerly, Your Majesty granted your consent, yet now you do not truly go. 'Truly' means sincerely. Does this mean your servant has committed some offense?"

King Zhuang replied, "I have heard that you have prepared a feast at Strong Terrace. Strong Terrace overlooks Liaoshan to the south, gazing upon Fanghuang. Liaoshan is a mountain name; Fanghuang is a water name—some say it is also a mountain name. To its left flows the Jiang, and to its right, the Huai. Its pleasures make one forget death. As for me, a man of meager virtue, I dare not partake of such joy, for I fear I would linger and be unable to return."

Thus Laozi said: "Do not display what may be desired, and the heart will not be disordered."

When Duke Chong'er of Jin was exiled and passed through Cao, he was treated with discourtesy. Duke Gong of Cao, hearing that Chong'er had fused ribs, ordered him to strip and fish so that he might observe through a screen. Li Fuji’s wife said to her husband, "Our lord has shown no courtesy to the Duke of Jin. I observe that his followers are all worthy men—his followers being men like Hu Yan and Zhao Cui. If they assist their lord in returning to Jin, they will surely attack Cao. Why not bestow favor upon him first?"

Li Fuji then sent him a pot of leftover food and added a jade disk. Chong'er accepted the food but returned the jade. When he later returned to his state and raised an army to attack Cao, he conquered it and commanded his three armies not to enter Li Fuji’s village.

Thus Laozi said: "That which is bent will be preserved; that which is crooked will be made straight."

King Goujian of Yue fought with Wu and was defeated. His state was broken, and he himself was captured, humiliated at Kuaiji. Burning with indignation, his resolve swelled like a surging spring. He drilled his soldiers, who charged into fire as if it were nothing. Yet he offered himself as a servant and his wife as a concubine, personally wielding a spear to lead Wu’s troops at the front of the charge. "At the front of the charge" means ahead of the horses. In the end, he captured the Wu king at Qian Sui.

Thus Laozi said: "The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. None under heaven does not know this, yet none can put it into practice." Because King Goujian personally endured humiliation, he later became hegemon over the Central States.

When Viscount Jian of Zhao died and had not yet been buried, Zhongmou submitted to Qi. "Submitted to Qi" means Zhongmou offered itself as a vassal to Qi. Five days after the burial, Viscount Xiang raised troops to besiege it. Before the armies could engage, a section of the city wall ten zhang in length collapsed on its own. Viscount Xiang struck the gong to signal a retreat. According to military law, drums command the troops to advance, while gongs signal retreat.

His officers remonstrated, "My lord punishes Zhongmou’s crime, yet the city walls crumbled on their own—this is heaven aiding us. Why withdraw?"

Viscount Xiang replied, "I have heard from Shu Xiang that a noble man does not take advantage of another’s misfortune nor press him in peril. Let them repair their walls, and only after they are repaired should we attack." Hearing of his righteousness, Zhongmou then requested to surrender.

Thus Laozi said: "It is precisely because he does not contend that none under heaven can contend with him."

Duke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, "You are advanced in years. Among your descendants is there one I might send to seek horses?"

"Descendants" refers to Bo Le’s sons.

Bo Le replied, "A fine horse can be assessed by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But one who can recognize the finest horse under heaven is like something vanished, lost, or gone—its signs are not visible. 'Vanished' means flickering in and out of sight; 'lost' means barely glimpsed; 'gone' means scarcely perceived. Such a horse leaves no dust in its wake and leaves no trace behind. My sons are all of inferior ability. They can be taught how to recognize a fine horse, but not how to recognize the finest horse under heaven. However, I have a companion who gathers firewood with me, named Jiu Fangyan. In judging horses, he is no less skilled than I. I request that you meet him."

Duke Mu met with him and sent him to seek horses. After three months, Jiu Fangyan returned and reported, "I have found a horse. It is in Shaqiu."

The Duke asked, "What kind of horse is it?"

Jiu Fangyan replied, "A yellow stallion."

The Duke sent someone to fetch it, but it turned out to be a black mare. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said, "A failure! The one you sent to seek horses cannot even distinguish the hair, sex, or form of a horse—how could he possibly recognize a true steed?"

Bo Le sighed deeply and said, "Has it truly come to this? This is why his ability surpasses mine ten thousandfold without measure. What Jiu Fangyan observes is the heavenly mechanism: he grasps the essence while forgetting the coarse, attends to the inner while disregarding the outer, sees what should be seen and ignores what should not, gazes upon what should be gazed upon and overlooks what should not. What he discerns in horses is something far more valuable than mere horses."

When the horse arrived, it was indeed a horse of a thousand *li*. Thus, Laozi said, *"Great straightness seems bent; great skill seems clumsy."*

Wu Qi served as Prime Minister of Chu and went to Wei, where he asked Qu Yiruo—Qu Yiruo, a Chu grandee who had fled to Wei—"Does the King not know my unworthiness and yet has made me Prime Minister? Sir, what do you make of my character?"

Qu Yiruo said, "What do you intend to do?"

Wu Qi replied, "I will reduce the ranks of Chu’s nobility and standardize its salary system, diminish the excess and relieve the deficient, sharpen its weapons and armor, and seize advantage from all under heaven when the time is right."

Qu Yiruo said, "As I have heard, those who once governed the state well did not alter its old ways or change its constant norms. Now, you intend to reduce the ranks of Chu’s nobility and standardize its salary system, diminish the excess and relieve the deficient—this is to alter its old ways and change its constant norms. Those who act thus will not prosper.

"I have also heard that anger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; and contention is the root of human affairs. Now, you secretly plot against virtue, delight in wielding instruments of misfortune, and initiate what is the root of human affairs—this is the height of perversity.

"Moreover, when you led the troops of Lu, you should not have prevailed against Qi, yet you did. When you led the troops of Wei, you should not have prevailed against Qin, yet you did—serving as the Guardian of the Western River, the Qin army dared not cross eastward.

"As I have heard, one who does not bring misfortune upon others cannot bring misfortune upon himself. I have long been perplexed that our King has repeatedly defied the Way of Heaven and violated human principles, yet to this day has suffered no calamity—it seems he has been awaiting you."

Wu Qi, startled, said, "Can this still be changed?"

Qu Yiruo replied, "One who has already taken form cannot be altered. One who has already shaped punishment has already brought misfortune upon the people. You would do better to cultivate kindness and act with sincerity."

Laozi said, *"Blunt its sharpness, untangle its knots, soften its glare, merge with the dust."*

When Jin attacked Chu, advancing three stages without halting, the ministers requested permission to strike. King Zhuang said, "In the time of my predecessor, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my reign, Jin attacks us—this is my fault. Why should I humiliate the assembled ministers?"

He said, "In the time of my predecessor’s ministers, Jin did not attack Chu. Now, in my time, Jin attacks us—this is my fault." He bowed his head and wept, his tears soaking his robe, then rose and bowed to the assembled ministers.

When the people of Jin heard this, they said, "Their ruler and ministers compete to take blame upon themselves, and their lord humbles himself before his ministers—we cannot attack them." That night, they withdrew their army and returned home.

Laozi said, "One who can bear the nation’s filth is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain."

In the time of Duke Jing of Song, Mars lingered in the Heart constellation. The Duke, alarmed, summoned Ziwei and questioned him. Ziwei was the master of astrology. The Duke asked, "Mars lingers in the Heart—what does this mean?"

Ziwei replied, "Mars is the celestial punishment. The Heart corresponds to Song’s celestial region, for Song’s domain is governed by the stars of Chamber and Heart. The calamity will fall upon the ruler. However, it may be transferred to the prime minister."

The Duke said, "The prime minister is the one I employ to govern the state. To shift death upon him would be inauspicious."

Ziwei said, "It may be transferred to the people."

The Duke said, "If the people die, whom shall I rule? I would rather die alone."

Ziwei said, "It may be transferred to the harvest."

The Duke said, "The harvest is the people’s lifeblood. If the harvest fails, the people will surely perish. As a ruler who would kill his people to save himself, who would still accept me as their lord? My fate is already sealed."

Ziwei fell silent and said no more. He turned and fled, then faced north and bowed twice, saying, "I dare to congratulate you, my lord. Heaven, though high, hears the lowly. You have spoken three times as a true ruler of men, and Heaven will surely reward you thrice. Tonight, the star will shift three stages, and you will extend your years by twenty-one."

The Duke asked, "How do you know this?"

Ziwei replied, "You have spoken three times as a ruler of men, so you will receive three rewards. The star will shift three stages, each stage covering seven *li*. Three times seven is twenty-one, so your years will be extended by twenty-one. I beg to prostrate myself before you to observe this. If the star does not shift, I will accept death."

The Duke said, "Very well."

That night, the star indeed shifted three stages. Thus, Laozi said, "One who can bear the nation’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven."

Formerly, when Gongsun Long was in Zhao, he said to his disciples, "I will not associate with those who lack ability." A visitor, clad in coarse cloth and a hempen belt, came and said, "Your servant can call out." Gongsun Long turned to his disciples and asked, "Has anyone among you ever been able to call out?" They replied, "No one." Gongsun Long said, "Grant him the register of disciples."

Some days later, he went to persuade the King of Yan. When they reached the riverbank, the ferry was on the opposite shore. The shore was the water’s edge. He had the skilled caller summon it, and with one call, the ferry came. Thus it is said, "The sage in the world does not reject those with skill or ability." Therefore, Laozi said, "No person is to be discarded, no thing is to be cast away—this is called inheriting illumination."

Zifa attacked Cai and overcame it. Zifa was a general of King Xuan of Chu. "Overcame" means to cross and vanquish. The king welcomed him beyond the suburbs, granted him a fief of a hundred *qing* of fields, and enfeoffed him with the Jade Scepter. In Chu, meritorious ministers were awarded a scepter, called the Jade Scepter, ranking them with the lords of dependent states. Zifa declined and would not accept, saying, "Governing the state and establishing policies, so that the feudal lords come as guests—this is the virtue of the ruler. Issuing commands and deploying troops, so that the enemy retreats before the armies meet—this is the might of the general. Arraying troops in battle and defeating the enemy—this is the strength of the common people. To ride upon the people’s toil and claim its rewards and emoluments is not the Way of benevolence and righteousness." Thus he declined and would not accept. Therefore, Laozi said, "Having achieved success, one does not dwell in it. Precisely because one does not dwell in it, it does not depart."

Duke Wen of Jin attacked Yuan. Yuan was a domain of Zhou. King Xiang of Zhou had granted Yuan to Duke Wen, but Yuan rebelled, so he attacked it. He made an appointment with his ministers for three days. When three days passed and Yuan did not surrender, Duke Wen ordered the army to withdraw. A military officer said, "Yuan will surrender in another day or two."

The Duke said, "I did not know that Yuan could not be taken in three days. To make an appointment with the ministers and not withdraw when the time is up would be to break faith. Even if I gained Yuan, I would not do it."

When the people of Yuan heard this, they said, "With such a lord, how can we not surrender?" They promptly surrendered. The people of Wen heard of it and also requested to surrender. At that time, the Zhou king had also granted Wen to Duke Wen, and the neighboring domains had all rebelled. Thus, Laozi said, "Dark and profound, within it lies essence. Its essence is most true, within it lies trust." Therefore, fine words can earn respect, and fine conduct can elevate one above others.

Gongyi Xiu served as prime minister of Lu. Gongyi Xiu was formerly a scholar of Lu. He was fond of fish. The entire state offered him fish, but Gongyi Xiu would not accept. His disciples remonstrated, "You are fond of fish, yet you do not accept them—why?"

He replied, "It is precisely because I am fond of fish that I do not accept them. If I accepted the fish and were dismissed from my post, though fond of fish, I could not provide them for myself. If I do not accept the fish and am not dismissed from my post, then I can long provide fish for myself. This is clarity in acting for others and for oneself." Therefore, Laozi said, "Putting oneself last, one finds oneself first; setting oneself outside, one finds oneself preserved. Is it not because one is selfless? Thus one accomplishes one’s private ends." Another version says, "Knowing contentment, one avoids disgrace."

An elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao—an old man who leaned on a staff—"There are three resentments people bear. Do you know them?"

Sunshu Ao asked, "What are they?"

The elder replied, "Those of high rank are envied by scholars; those in great office are detested by their lord; those with ample emoluments are resented by their peers."

Sunshu Ao said, "The higher my rank, the more I humble my aspirations; the greater my office, the smaller I make my heart; the more abundant my emoluments, the more I extend my generosity."

Thus may one avoid the three resentments?

Therefore, Laozi said, "The noble must take the lowly as its root; the high must take the low as its foundation."

The Grand Marshal inspected the hook-maker, Guo Fan. The hook-maker was eighty years old. *Chui* means forging and striking; *gou* means fishhook. Yet he never lost the point of the hook.

The Grand Marshal asked, "Are you skillful? Or do you possess the Dao?"

He replied, "Your servant has his discipline. At twenty, I delighted in forging hooks. To all things else, I paid no heed; apart from hooks, I observed nothing. Thus, what is used must borrow from what is not used, and so long abides in its use. How much more so for one who holds to what is not used? What thing would not be perfected thereby?"

Therefore, Laozi said, "One who engages in the Dao becomes one with the Dao."

King Wen honed his virtue and refined his governance. After three years, the two borders of the realm submitted to him. *Di* means to grind and sharpen. King Wen possessed two-thirds of the realm.

When King Zhou heard of this, he grew anxious, saying, "I rise early and retire late, striving to outpace him, yet my heart is wearied and my form exhausted. If I indulge and ignore him, I fear he will overthrow me alone."

Chong Hou Hu said, "The Earl of Zhou, Bo Chang, practices benevolence and righteousness and excels in strategy. His eldest son, Fa, is brave and unwavering; his second son, Dan, is reverent, frugal, and discerns the times. If we follow them, we cannot bear the calamity. If we pardon and release them, our person will surely be imperiled."

Though the cap be worn, it must still be placed upon the head. Before matters reach completion, let us devise a plan." Thus, Qu Shang imprisoned King Wen at Youli. Qu Shang was a minister of King Zhou. Youli was a place name, located in Tangyin of Henan.

Thereupon, San Yisheng sought the world’s rare treasures with a thousand gold pieces, obtaining a *zouyu* and a team of *jisi* steeds. The *zouyu* was a white tiger with black stripes, benevolent in nature, feeding only on beasts that had died of themselves, and capable of traveling a thousand *li* in a day. The *jisi* was a divine horse. He also acquired a hundred *gong* of dark jade—two jades made one *gong*—and a hundred *peng* of large cowrie shells—five shells made one *peng*. Further, he presented a black leopard, a yellow bear, a blue *an* (a kind of beast), and a *gan* (a wild dog from the northern lands), along with a thousand hides of white tigers with patterned fur. These he offered to King Zhou, gaining access through Fei Zhong. Fei Zhong was a sycophantic minister of King Zhou. Pleased upon seeing the gifts, King Zhou spared King Wen’s life and bestowed upon him an ox as reward.

King Wen returned and built the Jade Gate, constructed the Spirit Terrace, selected maidens, and struck bells and drums. The Jade Gate was adorned with jade, its pillars and pivots inlaid. "Selecting maidens" meant inspecting them; another interpretation holds it referred to choosing artisans. All this was to await King Zhou’s missteps. When King Zhou heard of this, he said, "The Earl of Zhou, Bo Chang, has altered his ways and changed his conduct—I have nothing to fear." Thereupon, he devised the *paoluo* torture, dismembered Bi Gan, ripped open pregnant women, and executed those who remonstrated.

King Wen then proceeded with his plans. Thus, Laozi said, "Know honor, yet hold to disgrace, and be a valley to the world."

King Cheng asked Yin Yi about governance, saying, "What virtue must I practice for the people to cherish their ruler?" Yin Yi was Historian Yi. He replied, "Let them act in due season, and treat them with reverence and compliance." The king asked, "Where does such a standard lie?" He answered, "As if treading over a deep abyss, as if walking upon thin ice." The king said, "How fearful it is to be a king!" Yin Yi replied, "Between heaven and earth, within the four seas, if they are good, they are our flock; if not, they are our foes. In former times, the ministers of Xia and Shang turned against Jie and Zhou to serve Tang and Wu; the people of Susha all rose against their lord and submitted to Shennong. Between Fuxi and Shennong, there were Gonggong and Susha, who once ruled the world. This is well known in the age. How could one not be fearful?"

Thus Laozi said, "What men fear cannot but be feared."

The followers of Robber Zhi asked him, "Does theft also have its Dao?" Zhi replied, "How could it be without one? To divine where valuables are hidden is sagacity; to enter first is courage; to withdraw last is righteousness; to divide spoils equally is benevolence; to know what can be taken and what cannot is wisdom. Without these five, none in the world can become a great thief."

From this we see that the mind of a thief must rely on the Dao of the sage before it can succeed. Thus Laozi said, "Cut off sagacity, cast away wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold."

The Chu general Zifa was fond of seeking men skilled in the arts of the Dao. A man adept at thievery came to see him and said, "I hear you seek men skilled in the arts of the Dao. I am a thief and wish to offer my skills to serve as one of your soldiers." *Zhi* means "to prepare," and *zu* means "sufficient."*

When Zifa heard this, he hurried out to receive him, his robe not yet properly belted and his cap askew. His attendants remonstrated, "Thieves are the robbers of the world. Why do you treat him with such ceremony?" Zifa replied, "This is not something you can understand."

Not long after, Qi raised an army to invade Chu. Zifa led his troops to meet them, but his forces were driven back three times. All the worthy ministers of Chu exhausted their strategies and sincerity, yet the Qi army grew only stronger. Then the thief from the marketplace stepped forward and said, "I have a modest skill. I wish to employ it for you." Zifa replied, "Very well," and sent him off without asking further.

That night, the thief slipped into the Qi general’s tent, removed the canopy, and presented it to Zifa. Zifa then sent a messenger to return it, saying, "One of our soldiers gathering firewood found your general’s canopy and has sent it back to your officers." The next night, the thief returned and took the general’s pillow, which Zifa again had returned. The following night, he took the general’s hairpin, which Zifa once more sent back.

When the Qi army heard of this, they were greatly alarmed. The general conferred with his officers and said, "If we do not withdraw today, the lord of Chu may yet take my head." So they retreated. Thus it is said, "There is no skill too small or base, if the ruler knows how to employ it." Therefore Laozi said, "The unvirtuous are the resource of the virtuous."

Yan Hui said to Confucius, "I have made progress." Confucius asked, "What do you mean?" Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten ritual and music." Confucius said, "Good, but not yet sufficient."

Another day, Yan Hui saw Confucius again and said, "I have made further progress." Confucius asked, "What do you mean?" Yan Hui replied, "I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness." Confucius said, "Good, but not yet sufficient."

On another occasion, Yan Hui met Confucius again and said, "I have attained *zuowang*." *Zuowang* means sitting in forgetfulness of oneself, thereby entering the Dao.

Confucius started and asked, "What do you mean by *zuowang*?" Yan Hui replied, "I break down the limbs, dull the senses, cast off form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the great transformation—this is *zuowang*."

Confucius said, "To merge is to be without partiality; to transform is to be without constancy. Since you surpass me in virtue, I ask to follow behind you." *Jian* means "to precede." Yan Hui precedes in virtue, so Confucius asks to follow.

Thus Laozi said: "Embracing the soul and holding to the One—can you never part from it? Concentrating qi to attain utmost softness—can you be like an infant?"

Duke Mu of Qin raised an army, intending to launch a surprise attack on Zheng. Jianshu said, "It cannot be done. I have heard that when attacking a state by stealth, chariots should not exceed a hundred *li*, nor men thirty *li*. This is to ensure that their plans have not yet been exposed, their armor and weapons not yet dulled or worn, their provisions not yet exhausted, and their people not yet wearied or sick. All rely on their high morale and full strength to strike with might. Now, marching thousands of *li* and crossing the lands of many feudal lords to launch a surprise attack—I do not see how this can succeed. My lord, reconsider carefully." Duke Mu did not heed him. Jianshu saw the army off, donning mourning garments and weeping. The army set forth, passing eastward through Zhou. A Zheng merchant, Xian Gao, falsely claimed the Earl of Zheng’s command, presenting twelve oxen to reward the Qin forces and treat them as guests. The three commanders grew fearful and conferred: "We have marched thousands of *li* to strike another, yet before we arrive, they already know—surely their defenses are prepared. It cannot be done." They turned the army back.

At that time, Duke Wen of Jin had just passed away and had not yet been buried. Xian Zhen spoke to Duke Xiang (Xian Zhen was a Jin minister; Duke Xiang was Duke Wen’s son): "In the past, our late lord and Duke Mu were allies—all under heaven knew of it, and none among the feudal lords were unaware. Now, our lord has died and is not yet buried, yet they neither offer condolences nor request passage—this is to dishonor our lord’s death and weaken our orphaned state. Let us strike them." Duke Xiang agreed. Xian Zhen raised troops and encountered the Qin army at Yao, crushing them. He captured their three armies and returned. When Duke Mu heard of this, he donned plain robes and entered the ancestral temple to explain himself to the people. *Shuo* means "to resolve." Thus Laozi said: "To know yet seem not to know—this is excellence. To not know yet claim to know—this is a flaw."

When the Queen of Qi died, the king wished to appoint a new queen but had not yet decided. He had his ministers deliberate. Lord Xue, wishing to align with the king’s intent (Lord Xue was Tian Ying), presented ten pairs of earrings, making one pair especially fine. The next day, he asked where the finest earrings had gone and thus urged the king to install their owner as queen. The King of Qi was greatly pleased and thereafter held Lord Xue in high esteem. Thus, when a ruler’s desires become apparent, they are controlled by their ministers. Therefore Laozi said: "Block the openings, shut the gates—throughout life, you will not toil."

Lu Ao roamed the Northern Sea (Lu Ao was a man of Yan; Emperor Qin Shi Huang summoned him as an erudite and sent him to seek immortals, but he fled and never returned). Passing through the Great Yin and entering the Dark Gate (the Great Yin is the north; the Dark Gate is a mountain of the north), he reached the summit of Mount Meng. On Mount Meng (a mountain name), he saw a scholar with deep-set eyes and dark temples, his cheeks streaming with tears (tears, water), his shoulders hunched like a kite’s, his upper body full and lower body slender. Loftily, he danced facing the wind. Glancing at Lu Ao, he slowly lowered his arms (slowly ceasing his dance) and fled behind a stele, hiding in its shadow. Lu Ao approached and saw him wearily (in Chu dialect, *juan* means "weary") cracking tortoise shells and eating clams (clams, sea bivalves).

Lu Ao addressed him: "Is it not only I, Ao, who has abandoned the crowd and left the herd to exhaustively observe beyond the six directions? From youth, I loved to wander, and in adulthood, I have not wavered. I have traversed the four extremes, save only the unseen north. Now, I suddenly behold you here—might you be a friend to Ao?" The scholar bit his knuckles and laughed, saying: "Ah! You are a man of the Central States—how could you willingly come so far? This place still receives the light of the sun and moon (speaking of the Great Yin’s land, where sun and moon are still visible) and bears the constellations. It is where yin and yang move and the four seasons arise. Compared to the nameless lands, it is but a corner of a room (he means the lands he roams cannot be named; compared to Lu Ao’s travels, they are but a room’s corner. *Ao* means "inner chamber"). If I journey south to the wilds of Gangshi, rest north in the lands of Chenmo, exhaust the west in the boundless dark, or open the east to the primal chaos—below, there is no earth; above, no sky. Listen, and you hear nothing; look, and you see no light. Beyond this, there are still the surging shores (the surging shores are the sounds of waters at the edge of the four seas and the heavens). Beyond a thousand myriad *li* (a thousand myriad *li* lies beyond the surging shores), I have not yet reached. Yet you, having only just begun your travels here, speak of exhausting observation—is this not far indeed? Nevertheless, stay here. I have an appointment with Hanman beyond the nine heavens (Hanman is unknowable; the nine heavens lie beyond the nine skies). I cannot tarry long." The scholar raised his arms, leapt, and vanished into the clouds. Lu Ao looked up but saw nothing, then halted his chariot (stopping the carriage he had driven). He was filled with regret (in Chu dialect, *peizhi* means "to regret not having become"). Bewildered, as if in mourning, he said: "Compared to this man, I am like a swan to a grub (the grub is an insect’s larva). All day, I travel no farther than a foot or two, yet believe myself to have gone far—is this not lamentable?" Thus Zhuangzi said: "The petty man does not reach the great man; petty knowledge does not reach great knowledge. The morning mushroom knows not dusk or dawn (the morning mushroom is an insect born at dawn and dead by dusk, living on water, resembling a silkworm moth. Also called *zimu*; in Hainan, it is called *chongxie*). The cicada knows not spring or autumn."

The *huiqi* is the *diaoliao*—this illustrates how even the brightest vision has its limits.

When Jizi governed Zhifu for three years—Jizi being Zijian—a disciple of Confucius named Wuma Qi donned coarse hempen robes and altered his appearance to observe the transformation. Changing his garments to go in secret, he watched from the shadows. He saw a fisherman release his catch at night.

Wuma Qi asked him, "In all your fishing, you seek to catch fish. Now that you have caught them, why do you let them go?"

The fisherman replied, "Jizi does not wish people to take small fish. In ancient times, fish less than a foot long were not placed on the cutting board. Since these are small fish, I release them."

Wuma Qi returned and reported to Confucius, saying, "Jizi’s virtue has reached its utmost—he makes men act in darkness as if harsh punishments stood at their side. How has Jizi attained this?"

Confucius said, "I once asked him about governance, and he replied, ‘To warn here is to punish there.’ Jizi must have practiced this method."

Thus Laozi said: *"Abandon that, take this."*

The *wangliang* asked the *jing*: The *wangliang* is a spirit of water. The *jing* is the reflection of sunlight or moonlight on water.

It said, "Is what shines so brightly the spirit of enlightenment?"

The *wangliang*, a being of dim and shifting form, saw the radiance of the reflection and took it for a divine presence.

The *jing* said, "No."

The *wangliang* asked, "How do you know?"

The *jing* replied: "When Fusang receives the sun’s radiance, it illuminates the cosmos. Fusang is the tree from which the sun emerges. *Receives its radiance* means Fusang takes in the sun, and at dawn, its brilliance shines forth. The gleaming light blazes across the Four Seas. Yet if doors are shut and windows sealed, it cannot enter. If it were the spirit of enlightenment, it would flow freely in all directions, reaching everywhere—above to the heavens, below coiling upon the earth—nurturing the myriad things yet leaving no trace, in the space between a bow and a rise encompassing even beyond the Four Seas. How could mere brightness suffice to reveal it?"

Thus Laozi said: *"The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest."*

*Guangyao* asked *Wu You* (the Utterly Non-Existent): "You are the most formless of all—does something truly exist, or is there truly nothing?" For form arises from the formless; how could nothing give birth to things? Thus he asked whether it truly exists or truly does not. *Wu You* made no reply. *Guangyao* could not press further, so he approached to observe its appearance. Gazing intently, he saw no shape; listening, he heard no sound. He reached out but could not grasp it; he looked afar but could not perceive its limit.

*Guangyao* said: "How sublime! Who could attain this? I can achieve *having no form*, but I have not yet reached *having no nothingness*." He meant he could make form ungraspable but could not yet transcend form entirely. If one attains *having no nothingness*, how could one reach this state?

Thus Laozi said: *"The non-existent enters where there is no space; thus I know the benefit of non-action."*

Duke Bai of Wei, consumed by thoughts of rebellion, stood after court leaning on his riding crop. The butt-end, tipped with a spike, pierced his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he did not notice. When the people of Zheng heard of this, they said: "If he forgets his own chin, what will he not forget?" Duke Bai’s father had been killed by Zheng, so he feared them. This shows how the spirit strays outward while thoughts scatter within, leaving the body unguarded.

Thus when the spirit’s use extends far, what it abandons is near—*near* meaning the self.

Therefore Laozi said: *"Without stepping outside, know all under heaven; without gazing through the window, see the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows."* This is what it means.

When the First Emperor of Qin gained the empire, he feared he could not hold it. He sent troops to the borders, built the Great Wall, repaired passes and bridges, set up barriers and outposts, prepared relay carriages, and stationed officials at the frontiers. Yet the Liu clan seized it as easily as turning a *bizhui*—a weaving tool for mats, flipped with ease.

In the past, King Wu overthrew Zhou at the Battle of Muye. He then honored the tomb of Bi Gan, marked the lane of Shang Rong, sealed the gate of Jizi (who had fled to Joseon, leaving his home empty), restored the temple of Cheng Tang, distributed grain from Juqiao, scattered coins from Lutai, smashed drums and broke zithers, unstrung bows and cut bowstrings, slept in the open to show humility, and laid aside his sword and scepter to show no enmity. Thereupon all under heaven sang his praises and rejoiced. The feudal lords came bearing tribute, and his dynasty endured for thirty-four generations.

Thus Laozi said: *"The master of closing needs no lock, yet none can open it. The master of binding needs no rope, yet none can untie it."*

Yin Xu studied charioteering for three years without success. He privately grieved, constantly pondering it even in sleep. One midnight, he dreamed he received the *qiūjià* technique from his master. *Qiūjià* is the art of skilled driving. The next day, he went to pay his respects. His master, seeing him, said: "I do not *love* the Dao enough to teach you, for I feared you could not receive it. Today I will teach you the *qiūjià*." Yin Xu turned and ran, then bowed northward, saying: "By heaven’s blessing, I already dreamed of receiving it last night!"

Thus Laozi said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard perfect stillness; as the myriad things arise, I observe their return."*

In the past, Sunshu Ao was appointed Chief Minister three times without elation, and dismissed three times without sorrow.

Yanling Jizi, though the people of Wu wished to make him king, refused; Xu You declined the empire when it was offered to him; Yanzi, when swearing an oath with Cui Zhu, faced death yet did not alter his demeanor—all these men possessed a far-reaching comprehension. When the spirit penetrates life and death, what thing could delude them?

In Jing there was a man named Yin Fei who obtained a precious sword from Ganque. *Gan* is pronounced like *han*. The state of Gan lay in present-day Linhuai, where the famed swords *Dong* and *Moye* were forged in the shapes of *Dong’e* and *Donghuo*. On his return journey, as he crossed the Yangtze, he reached midstream when the waves of Yanghou arose, and two jiao coiled about his boat. Jiao are a kind of dragon. Though the boat leaked two thousand five hundred *jin* of water, the jiao did not yet dominate. Yin Fei said to the boatman, "Has anyone ever survived such a situation?" The boatman replied, "I have never seen it." Thereupon Yin Fei closed his eyes in fierce resolve, rolled up his sleeves, drew his sword, and declared: "A warrior may be persuaded by the rites of benevolence and righteousness, but he cannot be coerced or robbed. These rotting flesh and decayed bones in the river—I cast aside my sword for them. What do I cherish?" He plunged into the river and stabbed the jiao, severing its head. All aboard the boat survived, the wind and waves subsided, and the King of Jing enfeoffed him with the rank of *zhigui*.

Confucius, hearing of this, said: "Ah, the noble man who discards rotting flesh, decayed bones, and his sword—was this not Yin Fei?" Thus Laozi said: *"Only he who does not treat life as something to be clung to is worthier than one who prizes life."*

The Qi man Chunyu Kun used *congruent persuasion* to advise the King of Wei, and the king debated him. Ten chariots were prepared to send him as an envoy to Jing, but he declined and departed. Others thought his *congruent persuasion* insufficient, so they employed *crosswise persuasion* instead, and his words took on that tone. *Congruent persuasion* advocates that the strategies of the feudal lords should align; *crosswise persuasion* argues that alignment is flawed and a different approach is needed. The King of Wei halted his mission and distanced himself from him. Losing the intent of *congruence* yet failing to achieve *crosswise* success—this was the root of his failure. Words must have a foundation, affairs must have a root. Lose their foundation and root, and no matter how many skills one possesses, they are not as good as few. Thus the Zhou tripods bore the image of Chui, whose fingers were depicted as severed, to show that even the greatest craftsmanship has its limits.

Master Shen said: "A carpenter knows how to make a door and can use it, yet this does not mean he *understands* the door—for he does not grasp its essential nature. Only when the door is shut can one truly *use* it. The essence of the door lies outside the door." There was a Mohist named Tian Jiu who wished to see King Hui of Qin. He prepared his carriage and bound its shafts, but after a full year in Qin, he still could not obtain an audience. A retainer mentioned him to the King of Chu, so he went to see the king. The King of Chu was greatly pleased with him, gave him credentials, and sent him as an envoy to Qin. Upon arrival, he presented the credentials meant for the general, and King Hui of Qin was delighted with him. After leaving the audience, he sighed deeply and said to his attendants: "I remained in Qin for three years without gaining an audience. I did not realize the Dao could be reached by way of Chu." Some things are near yet seem far, while others are distant yet feel close.

Thus the conduct of the great man is not constrained by rigid rules—he simply reaches his ultimate destination. This is what is meant by the saying: "The owl tries to fly while still tethered to the string." It means that a scholar’s rise and fall are unpredictable, his advancement and retreat without constancy, and thus he cannot be bound by rules. This is like an owl tied to a string below—if it tries to soar, it cannot. The Feng River is a thousand *ren* deep and does not admit dust or filth; yet if one casts gold, iron, or a needle into it, their forms appear on the surface. It is not that the water is not deep and clear, but that fish, turtles, dragons, and serpents refuse to dwell there. Therefore, no five grains grow on bare rock, and no elk or deer roam barren mountains—there is no shelter or concealment for them.

Long ago, Zhao Wenzi asked Shu Xiang: "Among the six generals of Jin, which will perish first?" The six generals were Han, Wei, Zhao, Fan, Zhonghang, and Zhibo. Shu Xiang replied: "Zhonghang and Zhibo." Wenzi asked: "Why?" Shu Xiang answered: "In their governance, they take harshness for discernment, severity for clarity, cruelty to subordinates for loyalty, and numerous schemes for merit. It is like stretching leather: the more it is stretched, the larger it becomes, but this is the way to tear it." Thus Laozi said: *"When governance is dull and unrefined, the people are honest and simple; when governance is sharp and exacting, the people are lacking and flawed."*

Duke Jing said to the Grand Diviner: "What can your Dao do?" The diviner replied: "It can shake the earth." *Dong* means "to shake." Yanzi went to see the duke, who said: "I asked the Grand Diviner what his Dao could do, and he said it could shake the earth. Can the earth truly be shaken?" Yanzi remained silent and did not answer. After leaving, he met the Grand Diviner and said: "Once I saw a *gou* star between Fang and Xin—will the earth shake?" The *gou* star is a guest star. *Si* refers to Fang. When the *gou* star lingers between Fang and Xin, the earth trembles. The Grand Diviner said: "Yes." Yanzi departed, and the Grand Diviner hurried to see the duke, saying: "I cannot shake the earth—the earth is about to shake on its own."

Tian Ziyang, a minister of Qi, heard of this and said: "Yanzi’s silence was to spare the Grand Diviner’s life. His visit to the Grand Diviner was to prevent the duke from being deceived. Yanzi can be called loyal to his superior and kind to his subordinate." Thus Laozi said: *"Square yet not cutting, sharp yet not wounding."*

Duke Wen of Wei feasted with his ministers at Quyang. As the wine flowed freely, the duke sighed deeply and said: "I alone have no Yu Rang as my minister." Yu Rang served Zhibo and died for him in his time of trouble, so Duke Wen longed to have him as a retainer. Jian Zhong raised a goblet and offered it, saying: "Let me penalize you, my lord." *Fu* means "to penalize," referring to punishing the lord with wine.

The lord said, "Why?" He replied, "I have heard that parents with a destined fate do not recognize a filial son, and a lord with the Dao does not recognize a loyal minister. What kind of lord was Yu Rang’s master? Yu Rang served his lord, yet his lord was killed—what was he like? He is not worthy of esteem."

Duke Wen received the goblet, drained it, and did not offer it in return. *Jiao* means "to drain." He said, "Had I ministers like Guan Zhong and Bao Shu, I would have had the merit of Yu Rang." Thus Laozi said: *"When the state is benighted and in chaos, there are loyal ministers."*

Confucius observed the temple of Duke Huan (lord of Lu) and saw a vessel there called a *youzhi*. *You* means "placed to the right." Confucius said, "Excellent! How fortunate I am to see this vessel." He turned and said, "Disciples, bring water." When water was brought and poured into it, the vessel stood upright when half-full—*half-full* meaning the water reached the vessel’s midpoint. When filled to the brim, it overturned. Confucius’s expression suddenly changed, and he said, "Excellent! This is how one maintains fullness."

Zigong, standing beside him, asked, "May I inquire how to maintain fullness?" Confucius said, "By yielding and diminishing it." Zigong asked, "What does it mean to yield and diminish it?" Confucius replied, "All things flourish and then decline; joy reaches its peak and turns to sorrow. The sun moves on from its zenith, and the moon wanes after it is full. Thus, the wise and perceptive guard themselves with foolishness; the learned and eloquent guard themselves with restraint; the martial and resolute guard themselves with awe; the wealthy and exalted guard themselves with humility; those whose virtue extends to all under heaven guard themselves with deference. These five principles are how the former kings preserved the realm without losing it. To reverse these five is to invite peril." Thus Laozi said: *"Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness. Only by not being full can one remain whole without becoming new."*

King Wu asked Taigong, "I have conquered Zhou and taken the realm—this is a minister killing his lord and a subject overthrowing his superior. I fear that later generations will never cease using arms and endlessly contend. What can be done?" Taigong said, "Excellent is Your Majesty’s question. Before capturing game, hunters fear only that their wounds are too slight, and when hunting birds, they fear the prey might escape unharmed—thus they fear wounds that are too small. Once captured, they fear only that too much flesh is damaged. If you wish to hold it long, then stop up the people’s senses—*senses* meaning ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Laozi said: *'Stop up their senses.'* Let the Dao be complete in useless affairs and vexatious teachings. Let them all delight in their occupations and fulfill their desires, so that the bright and the Way become obscure. Then remove their madness and bind it to wood—*madness* meaning disheveled hair, and *waterfowl* referring to a bird’s crest. Those who know refinement wear the crest. Remove their swords and gird them with tablets. Enforce three years of mourning to prevent the proliferation of kin. Elevate polite speech and humble deference to make the people non-contentious. Use wine and meat to connect them, lutes and zithers to entertain them, and ghosts and spirits to awe them. Multiply rituals and elaborate ceremonies to obscure their essence. Encourage lavish burials and prolonged mourning to exhaust their resources. Let them place pearls in the mouth and adorn the corpse with silken cords to impoverish their wealth. Dig deep tombs and raise high mounds to exhaust their strength. When families are poor and clans diminished, those who worry about calamity will be impoverished. By transforming customs in this way, you can hold the realm without losing it." Thus Laozi said: *"When transformation stirs and desires arise, I will suppress them with the nameless uncarved block."*

*The Eighteenth Scroll of the Huainanzi’s Explanations concludes here.*

**Comprehensive Discourse on Instruction, Part One**

This discourse broadly examines the successes and failures of past and present, using the Dao as the means of transformation, ultimately returning to unity—hence the title "Comprehensive Discourse," from which the chapter takes its name.

In ancient times, there were those who ruled all under Heaven wearing helmets and fur garments with turned collars. These were the ages before the Three Sovereigns. *Mou* refers to the helmet worn on the head, indicating that caps had not yet been invented. *Quanling* describes fur clothing with the hide folded and stitched, like the reversed collars of the northern tribes’ leather robes. Another interpretation holds that *mou* means unbound hair, and *quan* means merely wrapping the neck—both without adornment. Virtue arose without shame, and penal models were unused. They bestowed without seizing, for *bestow* meant providing the people with wealth, and *not seizing* meant making no demands upon them. All under Heaven did not criticize their attire but shared in their virtue. *Criticize* here means to reproach, and *shared* means to return to. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious, wind and rain timely, the myriad things flourished, governance was not oppressive, and lives were not cut short. The nests of crows and magpies could be reached and examined by bending down, and birds and beasts could be led by halters—why then were wide robes, broad sashes, curved collars, and ceremonial caps necessary? *Wide robes* refer to square-cut garments, like the left-side robes of officials today. *Broad sashes* are large belts, as in the *Book of Songs*: "hanging sashes like trailing stones." *Curved collars* are today’s garments with turned-back sleeves. *Wei* is the *weimao* cap, and *zhangfu* is another name for a cap.

In ancient times, people dwelled in marshes and double caves. *Dwelled* means to reside, and *double caves* are layered burrows. Another interpretation holds that caves were dug into embankments and cliffs to serve as dwellings. In winter, they could not withstand frost and snow; in summer, they could not endure the heat, stifling air, and biting insects. As the *Book of Songs* says: "The insects come..." The sages then arose—*arose* means to initiate—and built earthen walls and framed timber to construct palaces. *Framed* means to join, referring to the interlocking of beams. With ridgepoles above and eaves below, they sheltered from wind and rain. *Ridgepoles* are the roof’s main beams, and *eaves* are the overhanging edges. Thus they avoided cold and heat, and the people found contentment. *Contentment* means joy.

When Boyi first created clothing—Boyi was a minister of the Yellow Emperor. The *Genealogical Records* states that Boyi made robes and skirts. Another account holds that Boyi was the Yellow Emperor—he twisted hemp fibers into threads, weaving them by hand, the result resembling a net. *Tan* means sharp, and *suo* means labor. *Tan* is read as *tranquil*, unmoving. Later generations invented the loom and shuttle to improve its use, allowing people to cover their bodies and ward off cold. *Cover* means to conceal, and *ward off* means to resist.

In ancient times, people plowed with sharpened plowshares and hoed with ground conch shells. *Sharpened* means to make keen, and *plowshares* are spade-like tools. *Conch* refers to large clams, which were ground to a sharp edge for use. *Hoeing* means clearing weeds from seedlings. They cut firewood with hooked blades and drew water with earthen jars. *Hooked blades* are sickles, read like *juyang* in Jiyin. *Firewood* refers to kindling. *Earthen jars* are jars; in Yanzhou, small jars are called *zhen*, and in Youzhou, they are called *wa*. The people labored much but gained little. Later generations invented the plow, plowshare, mallet, and hoe, cut firewood with axes, and drew water with well-sweeps. *Mallets* are read as *you*, meaning to pound clods. In the Three Adjuncts, they are called *tai*, used to cover seeds. Thus the people found ease and greater benefit.

In ancient times, great rivers and famous valleys cut off roads, preventing travel. They then hollowed logs and joined planks to make boats and ferries. *Hollowed* means to make empty, and *joined* means to connect. Boats linked together formed ferries. Thus, regions with and without resources could exchange goods. *Exchange* means to transport what one has to where it is lacking. They then made soft shoes to traverse a thousand *li*, sparing the toil of carrying loads on their shoulders. *Soft shoes* are light footwear. *Toil* means labor. Later, they invented wheeled carts and erected carriages, harnessing horses and yoking oxen, allowing people to reach distant places without fatigue, for they no longer bore loads on their shoulders.

When fierce birds and savage beasts harmed people and there was no means to defend against them, they smelted metal and forged iron to make weapons and blades, so that savage beasts could no longer cause harm. With weapons and blades prepared, they could not harm people. Thus, when people faced difficulties, they sought convenience; when afflicted by misfortune, they devised defenses. Each person used their knowledge to avoid harm and pursue benefit. Established customs could not be followed blindly, and tools and implements could not remain unchanged. *Follow* means to adhere. What could be altered at the time was altered, hence it is said they could not be. Thus, the laws and measures of former kings underwent changes.

In ancient marriage rites, the groom was not addressed as the host, for the betrothed himself was not called by name but referred to by his father, elder brothers, teachers, or friends. Shun did not inform his parents before marrying, which was contrary to ritual. Yao, knowing Shun’s worth, gave him his two daughters in marriage, but Shun did not inform his father, who was obstinate and often sought to kill him. Shun knew that if he informed his father, he would not be allowed to marry. There is no greater unfiliality than having no descendants, so Mencius said, "Shun’s not informing was as good as informing." The eldest son was to be established as heir, but King Wen set aside Boyi Kao and appointed King Wu instead, which was not in accordance with the system.

The rites prescribe marriage at thirty, for when yin and yang had not yet separated, both were born from *zi*. Counting from *zi*, men move leftward thirty years to reach *si*, and women move rightward twenty years to also reach *si*, where husband and wife unite. Thus the sages, following this principle, established the ritual that men marry at thirty and women at twenty. *For* men, counting from *si* leftward ten years reaches *yin*, so people are born in the tenth month at *yin*, hence men’s counting begins from *yin*. For women, counting from *si* rightward reaches *shen*, so they are also born in the tenth month at *shen*, hence women’s counting begins from *shen*.

**The Nineteenth Scroll of the Huainanzi’s Explanations**
**Recorded by Xu Shen, Grandee Secretary and Libationer**

Beribkao, elder brother of King Wu, was passed over when the worthy was enthroned and the younger replaced the elder—this was but the sages’ expedient measure. King Wen fathered King Wu at fifteen, which was not the proper rule. The Year Star completes its circuit in twelve years, and the celestial Dao is perfected in twelve, so the lord of a state is capped at twelve and then marries. To father a child at fifteen is to emphasize the succession of the state, not to follow the old statutes. From the preceding passage, it should have been Beribkao who married.

The Xia dynasty laid the deceased on the eastern steps for the funeral rites. According to ritual, the offering of rice was made beneath the window, the minor encoffining within the door, and the major encoffining on the eastern steps. When on the bier, the deceased is called a *shi*; when in the coffin, a *jiu*. To lay the deceased in the position of the guest and to perform the ancestral rites in the courtyard before burial in the tomb—yet on the eastern steps, the deceased still occupies the position of the host, and one cannot bear to distance them as a guest. The Yin people laid the deceased between the two pillars, for *ying* are pillars. The Record states: “The Yin laid the deceased in the hall between the two pillars, where host and guest share the space.” The Zhou people laid the deceased on the western steps, thereby sending them off as a guest. Such are the differences in these rites.

The Youyu clan used earthen coffins, for the Youyu were the age of Shun. Earthen coffins were made of fired clay. The Xia dynasty, being sagely and encompassing, refers to the age of Yu. With no inner or outer coffin, they used earthen tiles two feet wide and four feet long, stacking them on their sides to shield the body from the soil—this was called *sagely encompassing*. The Yin people used an outer coffin, fashioning it from cypress wood of appropriate thickness, with the inner coffin as the standard. The Zhou people placed screens along the walls, these being differences in burial practices. The Zhou used both inner and outer coffins, so they set up screens along the walls, shaped like today’s waist-high fans, painted with patterns and inserted into the sides of the hearse as ornamentation. The number and size varied according to the rank and mandate of the deceased.

The Xia dynasty sacrificed in darkness, within the chamber, at midnight. The Yin people sacrificed in the light, in the hall, at dawn. The Zhou people sacrificed at sunrise, in the courtyard. *Zhao* means the courtyard. Such are the differences in sacrificial rites.

Yao had the *Great Eulogy*, Yao’s music. Shun had the *Nine Shao*, Shun’s music. The Book states: “The *Xiao Shao* in nine movements.” Yu had the *Great Xia*, Yu’s music. Tang had the *Great Hu*, Tang’s music. King Wu of Zhou had the *Martial Elegy*, King Wu’s music. Such are the differences in music.

Thus the Five Emperors followed different Ways yet their virtue covered the world, and the Three Kings pursued distinct affairs yet their names endured for later generations—all adapted to the times and established rites and music. It is like the Master Kuang adjusting the bridges of his zither: though the shifts up and down follow no fixed inch or foot, none fail to strike the right note. Therefore, one who understands the essence of rites and music can create music, for they have a fundamental principle within and thus know the compass and square’s full reach. *Ju* means square; *yue* means the standard of measure.

Duke Zhao of Lu had a compassionate mother whom he loved, and when she died, he wore a white hempen cap for her, hence the mourning rites for a compassionate mother. A compassionate mother is one whom the father commands to raise oneself. Compared to the concubine of a grandee or the wife of a knight, she is called a *female mother*, and the ritual prescribes three months of hempen mourning. Duke Zhao alone wore the white hempen cap, illustrating the origin of this recorded ritual.

The Marquis of Yang killed the Marquis of Liao and took his wife, so the grand banquet abandoned the rites for the lady. The *Marquis of Yang* was the lord of Yangling. The *Marquis of Liao* was a descendant of Gaoyao, lord of a state of the Yan clan, now in Lujiang. In ancient times, during the grand banquet, the lord held the goblet while the lady held the bean. The Marquis of Yang, seeing the beauty of the Marquis of Liao’s wife, killed the marquis and married her, thereby abolishing the rites for presenting the lady. This is the origin of the recorded abolition.

The former kings’ institutions were abandoned when they became unsuitable.

In the degenerate age, good deeds are recorded; thus, rites and music have never been immutable. Therefore, the sage establishes rites and music but is not bound by them. The sage can create rites and music yet is not constrained by rites and music. Governing a state has its constants, but benefiting the people is the foundation. *Foundation* means the essential. Government and education have their norms, but effective commands are paramount. *Norms* means constants; *paramount* means the highest. If it benefits the people, there is no need to imitate antiquity. If it suffices for the matter at hand, there is no need to follow old ways. *Old* means customary. As the tradition states, "The old is not necessarily good," for old ways may also bring fault.

When the Xia and Shang declined, they perished by refusing to change their laws. *Perished* refers to Jie and Zhou. When the Three Dynasties arose, they did not follow one another yet reigned as kings. The *Three Dynasties* were Yu, Tang, and Wu. *Follow* means to imitate. Thus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rites to customs. *Adapts* means to change. Clothing, tools, and implements each suit their use; laws, decrees, and commands each fit their circumstances. Therefore, changing antiquity cannot be condemned, nor is following custom sufficient praise. *Following* means adhering; *custom* means the usual.

The hundred rivers, though their sources differ, all flow into the sea, taking the sea as their master. The hundred schools, though their pursuits vary, all strive for order. *Pursuits* means affairs, and *order* is the essential. When the kingly Way declined, the *Odes* arose—the *Odes* serve to criticize the kingly Way. When the Zhou house abandoned rites and virtue collapsed, the *Spring and Autumn* emerged—the *Spring and Autumn* serves to sever what does not follow rites and virtue. The *Odes* and *Spring and Autumn* are the finest of learning, yet both arose in declining ages. Confucians follow them to teach and guide the world, but how can this compare to the flourishing Three Dynasties? To value the *Odes* and *Spring and Autumn* as the ancient Way, or to esteem the times before their composition, is to mistake a broken Way for its wholeness. Reciting the *Odes* and *Documents* of the former kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping their intent. To grasp the intent behind the sage’s words is to attain what words cannot express. The sage’s words are subtle and profound; though ordinary people may grasp them, their mouths cannot articulate them. Thus, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." The *constant Dao* is deep, hidden, and obscure—unutterable, like the sage’s words, which are too subtle to be spoken.

When the Duke of Zhou served King Wen, he acted without arbitrary authority. *Arbitrary authority* means unilateral decision-making. He never acted on his own initiative but sought permission before proceeding. His person seemed too frail to bear his robes; his words seemed too hesitant to leave his mouth. He served King Wen with reverence, yielding and compliant, as if unable to bear the responsibility, fearing to fail him. *Yielding and compliant* describes his gentle deference. *Unable to bear* and *fearing to fail* show his utmost caution. *Yielding* is read like *tong* in *tingtong*; *compliant* is read like the second character in *li□*. He could be called a filial son.

When King Wu died and King Cheng was young, the Duke of Zhou succeeded King Wen’s enterprise, assumed the throne’s authority, and administered the realm’s governance. *Authority* refers to the throne’s records; *governance* means administration. *Authority* may also be written as *steps*. He pacified the barbarian rebellions—*pacified* means to quell the Yi and Di who disrupted the Xia—and punished the crimes of Guan and Cai. The Viscount of Cai was the Duke of Zhou’s elder brother; the Viscount of Guan was his younger brother. The two brothers supervised Yin but incited Wu Geng’s slander to sow chaos in Zhou. The Duke of Zhou executed them for the state’s sake. As the tradition states, "Great righteousness overrides kinship."

He bore the screen and received the feudal lords in audience. *Bore* means to lean against; *screen* refers to the space between the door and window, signifying the south-facing position. He meted out punishments and rewards, made decisions without hesitation, and resolved matters in his heart. His might shook heaven and earth; his voice awed the realm. *Awed* means to subdue, to bring the Four Seas into submission. He could be called martial.

When King Cheng came of age, the Duke of Zhou returned the throne’s records and governance, facing north to offer tribute and serve as a minister. *Returned* means to restore; he presented the jade and silk of tribute, observing the rites of a minister. He sought permission before acting and reported before proceeding, consulting on every matter. *Reported* means to inform. He harbored no willful ambitions, displayed no pride in his achievements, and showed no arrogance in his virtue. He neither boasted of his merits nor exalted his goodness. He could be called a dutiful minister.

Thus, one man’s life encompassed three transformations to respond to the times. How much more so when rulers change with each generation and states change lords with each succession? People use their positions to indulge their likes and dislikes—each employs their favor and rank to pursue what they love and hate, wielding their power to satisfy their desires. To expect a single rite or fixed law to meet the demands of changing circumstances is clearly impossible. *A single rite* is not an adaptable rite; *a fixed law* is not an adaptable law. Thus, it is said they cannot *hit the mark of expediency*. *Expediency* means adapting to circumstances without losing the mean.

Therefore, what the sage follows is called the Dao; what the sage does is called affairs. The Dao is like metal and stone—once tuned, it does not change. Affairs are like the zither and lute—each string requires a new tuning. *Metal and stone* refer to bells, which, once tuned, do not alter. The *zither and lute* have strings of varying tension and movable bridges, so their tuning adapts to each affair.

Thus, laws, institutions, rites, and virtue are tools for governing people, not the essence of governance. Laws, institutions, rites, and virtue can serve as the foundation of governance, but governance itself lies in the ruler’s virtue. They are like the bow and arrow, tools for shooting, yet hitting the mark depends on the archer’s skill. Therefore, benevolence is the warp, and righteousness the weft—these are unchanging for ten thousand generations. As for assessing one’s abilities and examining their use in the times, even daily changes may be fitting.

One must assess one’s own abilities, examine one’s conduct in due time, select what is good and esteem its use—there is no need to follow convention. Thus it is said: even daily changes may be fitting. Only benevolence and righteousness cannot be altered, and so they remain unchanged for ten thousand generations.

Is there any fixed law under heaven? One must adapt to the times and act as is fitting. When governance aligns with the affairs of the age, accords with human principles, follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth, and harmonizes with the spirits, then proper order may be established. *Aligns* means to accord; *harmonizes* means to follow.

In ancient times, people were sincere and craftsmen steadfast. Merchants were honest, and women chaste. *Sincere* means honest and unpretentious; *steadfast* means firm in qi and meticulous. *Honest* means free from deceit; *chaste* means upright and without impropriety. Thus, governance and education were easily transformed, and customs readily shifted.

In the present age, virtue has further declined, and the people’s customs have grown ever more shallow. To govern a people already corrupted with the laws of simplicity and gravity is like driving a wild horse without bit, bridle, whip, or goad. *Bit* refers to the iron piece placed in the horse’s mouth, as large as the yolk of a chicken’s egg, by which the horse is controlled. *Bridle* is the headstall and reins. *Wild horse* means a rearing, unruly horse.

In the past, Shennong ruled without decrees, and the people followed; without decrees, governance relied on knotted cords. Tang and Yu had decrees but no punishments; their decrees were resplendent with culture and refinement. Their governance was ever rooted in benevolence and righteousness, so the people did not violate laws or incur execution—thus it is said there were no punishments. The Xia lords did not break their word, for their speech was trustworthy. The Yin people swore oaths, binding themselves with words, and did not violate them. The Zhou people made covenants, gathering when matters arose and swearing oaths when discord emerged. *Covenants* involved slaughtering animals and drinking their blood as a pledge.

Yet in the present age—referring to when the Prince of Huainan composed this work—people are cruel in inquiry and quick to shame, greedy for gain and lacking in shame. To govern them with the Way of Shennong would surely lead to chaos. Bocheng Zigao resigned his rank as feudal lord to till the fields, and the world held him in high esteem. Bocheng Zigao was likely a man of Yao’s time. *Inquiry* is read as the descendants of the Xia lords. Today, those who resign office to live in seclusion rank among the lowest of their villages—how can they be compared?

In ancient warfare, only bows and swords were used; wooden spears had no striking edge, and long halberds no piercing tip. *Wooden spears* were made of wood; *no striking edge* means they lacked an iron blade. *Piercing tip* refers to the point. *Wooden* is read like the second character in *qicao* (grub). In later ages, siege towers were used for attack, and mobile shields for defense. *Siege towers* were tall structures used to overlook enemy cities and breach their walls. *Mobile shields* were gradually advanced; one account calls them a type of armor, as in the *Guoyu*: "presenting armor of patterned weave." *Shields* were canopies to block arrows. Repeating crossbows were used for shooting, and armored chariots for combat. *Repeating crossbows* had a single string drawn by oxen, with blades mounted on either side and triggered by a mechanism—called *armored chariots*. *Armored* is read like the second character in *gengxiao* (a type of rope).

In ancient times, when attacking a state, one did not kill the young or capture the gray-haired. *Young* refers to children; *gray-haired* means those with white hair. What was once deemed righteous is now mocked. What the ancients considered honorable—like Bocheng Zigao—is now seen as shameful, ranking among the lowest of one’s village. What the ancients used to establish order is now the cause of chaos.

Shennong and Fuxi did not employ rewards or punishments, yet the people did no wrong. Yet those who establish governance cannot abandon laws to rule the people, for they cannot match Shennong and Fuxi. Shun subdued the Youmiao with shield and battle-axe; at first, the Youmiao rebelled, but when Shun danced with shield and axe between the two staircases, they submitted. This was the power of virtue to transform and draw them near. Yet those who wage war cannot lay down their armor and weapons to restrain the violent, for they cannot match Shun.

From this, we see that laws and institutions serve to evaluate customs and regulate urgency or leniency, while tools and weapons adapt to the times and suit the occasion. The sage creates laws, and all things follow them—*follow* means to comply. The worthy establish rites, and the unworthy are constrained by them—*constrained* means to be checked. Those bound by laws cannot be entrusted with grand undertakings; those confined by rites cannot be made to respond to change. One who does not distinguish between clear and muddy tones cannot be tasked with tuning instruments; one who does not understand the roots of order and chaos cannot be tasked with creating laws. Only those with uniquely perceptive ears and uniquely discerning vision can then master the Way and act accordingly.

The Yin altered the Xia, the Zhou altered the Yin, and the Spring and Autumn period altered the Zhou—*altered* means to change. The rites of the Three Dynasties differed; which antiquity should one follow? When great men act, their disciples follow—*follow* means to comply. One who understands the origins of law and governance adapts to the times; one who does not know their source, though they follow the ancients, will ultimately bring chaos.

The laws and records of the present age change with the times; rites and righteousness shift with customs. Yet scholars cling to the past, inheriting old teachings and adhering to outdated texts, believing that nothing but these can bring order. This is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole—seeking a proper and secure fit will be difficult indeed.

Today, the Confucians and Mohists praise the Three Dynasties and Kings Wen and Wu but do not practice their ways. This is to speak of what they do not do; unable to act, they merely speak. They do not adapt to the present age, instead practicing what they oppose. Praising what they approve while practicing what they disapprove, they exhaust their days in deep thought yet contribute nothing to governance, wearing out their bodies and depleting their wisdom to no benefit for their lord.

Now, why do painters prefer to depict ghosts and demons yet dislike painting dogs and horses? It is because ghosts and demons do not appear in the world, while dogs and horses are seen every day. To preserve stability and govern chaos, wisdom is essential; to first invoke the ancients while discussing the Way—even fools can do that in excess.

Thus, laws that are not applied, the sage-kings do not practice; words that are unverified, the sage-kings do not heed. *Heed* means to accept.

The qi of Heaven and Earth is nothing greater than harmony. Through harmony, the myriad things are born. Harmony means yin and yang are balanced, day and night are distinct, and living things emerge. At the spring equinox, they are born; at the autumn equinox, they mature. Birth and maturation must attain the essence of harmony. *Essence* refers to qi.

Therefore, the Way of the sage is tolerant yet exacting, stern yet warm, gentle yet upright, fierce yet benevolent. This speaks of the mutual complement of hardness and softness, tolerance and severity. Too hard, it snaps; too soft, it bends. The sage stands precisely between hardness and softness, thereby grasping the root of the Way. *Root* means source.

Accumulated yin sinks; accumulated yang soars. Only when yin and yang interact can harmony be achieved.

The carpenter’s line serves as a measure: it can be coiled and extended. Pulled taut, it becomes straight and clear. *Clear* means visible. Thus, the sage embodies it. *Embodies* means practices.

That which is long yet not overbearing, short yet not insufficient, straight yet not rigid, enduring yet not forgotten—only the carpenter’s line achieves this.

Thus, if benevolence is overindulged, it becomes weakness, and weakness lacks authority. *Overindulged* means misapplied. If severity is overindulged, it becomes cruelty, and cruelty lacks harmony. If affection is overindulged, it becomes indulgence, and indulgence lacks command. *Indulgence* means laxity. If punishment is overindulged, it becomes tyranny, and tyranny loses kinship. *Tyranny* means harm. One who harms others will find no one close to them.

In the past, Duke Jian of Qi relinquished the reins of his state and entrusted them entirely to his chief minister. *Duke Jian* was the son of Duke Dao and Yangsheng. *Chief minister* refers to Chen Chengzi. The generals and ministers usurped power and monopolized authority, forming private factions, so that the public Way was not practiced. *Factions* means cliques. Thus, Chen Cheng, Tian Chang, and Chi Yi Zi Pi succeeded in their rebellion. *Rebellion* refers to the assassination of Duke Jian. This caused the House of Lü to be cut off from its ancestral sacrifices. *The House of Lü* was the lineage of the Grand Duke; Duke Jian was its descendant. *Cut off from ancestral sacrifices* means the Chen clan replaced them. The state came to be ruled by the Chen clan—this arose from excessive softness and weakness.

Zi Yang of Zheng was resolute and fond of punishment. *Zi Yang* was the lord of Zheng; some say he was the prime minister. In meting out punishments, he was unyielding and unforgiving. When a retainer broke a bow, fearing punishment and execution, he took advantage of the chaos caused by a mad dog to kill Zi Yang. *Retainer* means a household minister. The people of the state pursued the mad dog in uproar, and the retainer used the opportunity to kill Zi Yang, fearing his severity. This was the consequence of excessive hardness and severity.

Now, those who do not understand the Way see the weak and yielding being encroached upon and thus pride themselves on being resolute and firm. When they see the resolute and firm perish, they pride themselves on being weak and yielding. This stems from having no inner principle, while their perceptions and experiences are contradictory and erratic. *Contradictory* means conflicting. Thus, they pass their lives without a fixed direction. *Fixed* means settled; *direction* means destination.

It is like one who does not understand music attempting to sing: if the notes are muddied, they become stifled and lack modulation. *Stifled* means obstructed; *modulation* refers to the *zhuan* in *chuan* (transmission). If the notes are too clear, they become shrill and unmelodic. *Shrill* means withered; *melodic* means harmonious. But when Han E, Qin Qing, and Xue Tan sing, *All three were skilled singers.* or when Hou Tong and Man Sheng perform, *Both were skilled singers; some say Man Sheng means "long notes."* their hearts are stirred, their feelings accumulate within, and when their voices pour forth, none fail to align with the pitch-pipes and resonate with the human heart.

Why is this? Because within, they have a fundamental principle to determine clarity and turbidity, not relying on external influences but serving as their own standard.

Now, consider the blind walking on the road: if someone says "left," they go left; if someone says "right," they go right. If they encounter a gentleman, they may easily find the way, but if they meet a petty person, they fall into a ditch. Why? Because their eyes cannot perceive things. *Perceive* means to engage with.

Thus, when Wei employed both Lou Diao and Wu Qi, it lost the Western River. *Duke Wen of Wei appointed Lou Diao and Wu Qi but ignored other worthies. Qin attacked and seized the land of Western River.* When King Min exclusively relied on Tan Chu, he died in the eastern temple. *Min* is read like the *Wen* in *Wenshui*. *King Min* was a descendant of Tian Chang and succeeded the House of Lü as marquis of Qi. After the Spring and Autumn period, he usurped the title of king. *Tan Chu* was a general of Chu who fled to Qi and became a minister. King Min was unprincipled, and Tan Chu killed him, suspending his sinews from the beam of the temple gate, where he died after three days. See the *Strategies of the Warring States.* This was due to lacking the art of governance.

King Wen employed both Lü Wang and Duke Shao Shi and became king. *Lü Wang* was Grand Duke Lü Shang, skilled in military strategy. *Shi* was Duke Shao Kang, skilled in governing the people and celebrated in the *Ode to the Sweet Pear.* King Zhuang of Chu exclusively relied on Sunshu Ao and became hegemon. This was due to possessing the art of governance. *Sunshu Ao* was a grandee of Chu who recommended Jia Bo Ying’s son. Some say he was a youth, but his worth was recognized, thus achieving hegemony.*

Music is made with strings and songs, drums and dances; propriety is cultivated with circling and bowing. Elaborate burials and prolonged mourning are observed to send off the dead—these were established by Confucius, yet Mozi criticized them. *Criticized* means reproached. Universal love, exalting the worthy, revering ghosts, and rejecting fate—these were established by Mozi, yet Yangzi criticized them. *Universal love* is shown by honoring the Three Elders and Five More; *exalting the worthy* is practiced through selecting scholars and the great archery ceremony; *revering ghosts* is done by solemnly sacrificing to the father; *rejecting fate* is achieved by following the four seasons. All these were not valued by Yangzi, hence his criticism.

Preserving one’s nature and safeguarding authenticity, not allowing things to burden the body—these were established by Yangzi, yet Mencius criticized them. *Preserving one’s nature and safeguarding authenticity* refers to not plucking a single hair to benefit the world, refusing to let things burden one’s body. Mencius studied under the disciples of Zisi, perfected the virtues of Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties, expounded the *Odes* and *Documents*, and conveyed the intent of Confucius. He opposed the excessive words of Yang and Mo, hence his criticism.

People’s choices and rejections differ, each possessing their own enlightened understanding. Thus, right and wrong have their proper places—when one attains the proper place, there is no wrong; when one loses it, there is no right. The peoples of Danxue, Taimeng, Fanzhong, Kongtong, Daxia, Beihu, Qigong, and Xiugu—each holds different views on right and wrong, their customs clashing in opposition. Danxue lies in the south, beneath the sun’s descent; Taimeng is in the west, where the sun sets. Fanzhong is a kingdom whose people walk southward yet leave footprints facing north. Kongtong is a land beneath the loftiest peaks; Daxia lies in the west. Beihu is in the south; the peoples of Qigong and Xiugu dwell in the southwest. All eight of these lie beyond the Nine Provinces, within the domain of the Eight Yi.

Rulers and ministers, superiors and inferiors, husbands and wives, fathers and sons—each has means by which they employ one another. What is right here is not right there; what is wrong here is not wrong there. "Here" serves as a near analogy for the Hua peoples; "there," a distant analogy for the Eight Yi. To discard what the Hua peoples deem right because the Eight Yi deem it wrong, or to practice what the Hua peoples deem wrong because the Eight Yi deem it right, is like the axe, adze, mallet, and chisel—each has its proper application. *Application* means suitability.

In the time of Yu, governance was conducted through the five tones. Yu, the fifth-generation descendant of Zhuanxu and son of Gun, was named Wenming. Upon receiving the abdication and achieving success, he was called Yu. The five tones—gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu—were employed thus: bells, drums, chimes, and bells with clappers were hung, and small drums set out to await scholars from the four directions. A proclamation was issued: "Those who instruct me in the Dao shall strike the drum"—for the Dao harmonizes yin and yang, and striking the drum once adjusts the five tones. "Those who discuss affairs with me shall shake the bell"—the bell, a metal mouth with a wooden tongue, produces sound; since affairs are not of one kind, it is shaken. "Those who speak to me of concerns shall strike the chime"—the chime is made of stone, its sound urgent; concerns, too, are urgent matters, hence the chime is struck. "Those with legal disputes shall shake the small drum"—disputes involve litigation, and litigation is a single matter, hence the small drum is used.

At that time, Yu rose ten times for every meal and grasped his hair thrice while washing—*a meal* refers to food. He wearied himself for the people of the world, *wearied* meaning toil, as in the phrase "toil and welcome." If, in such times, one could not attain goodness or demonstrate loyalty, it was due to insufficient talent. At that time, if one could not attain goodness or offer loyalty, it was because one lacked the capacity.

In the time of Qin, lofty towers and grand gardens were constructed, distant thoroughfares laid, and metal statues cast. In the twenty-sixth year of the First Emperor of Qin, having just unified the realm, a giant appeared in Lintao, standing five *zhang* tall with footprints six *chi* long. Modeling its form, he cast metal statues to resemble it—these were the figures known as Wengzhong and Junhe. Conscripts were sent to garrison the frontiers, and taxes of hay and straw were levied to supply the state’s needs. Poll taxes were collected by headcount, and levies were gathered like dust in a dustpan, all delivered to the *Shaofu*. *Poll taxes* were assessed per capita; *dustpan levies* resembled dustpans in their sweeping collection of wealth. The *Shaofu* was an official position, akin to the later *Sinong*.

Strong men were dispatched west to Lintao and Didao—Lintao was a county in Longxi where the Tao River rises in the north; Didao was a county in Hanyang. They were sent east to Kuaiji, Fushi, and beyond—Kuaiji was a mountain, and Fushi rose and fell with the water, never submerged. All these lay within the borders of Liaoxi. One account places Kuaiji Mountain beneath Mount Tai, where the First Emperor performed the feng sacrifice at Mount Tai and the shan sacrifice at Kuaiji; *Kuaiji* is sometimes written as *Canghai*. They were sent south to Yuzhang and Guilin—Yuzhang was the Yuzhang Commandery, and Guilin the Yulin Commandery. They were sent north to Feihu and Yangyuan—Feihu likely refers to Feihu Mountain south of Daijun; Yangyuan was perhaps in Taiyuan. Another account places it five *li* east of Guangchang in Daijun. Corpses filled the roads and ditches.

At that time, those who offered loyal remonstrance were called inauspicious, and those who spoke of benevolence and righteousness were deemed mad. By the time of the High Emperor, he preserved what was lost and restored what was broken. The High Emperor was Liu Bang. Upholding the great righteousness of the world, he personally rolled up his sleeves and seized weapons to plead for the people’s lives before Heaven. Wielding sharp blades, he punished the unrighteous to seek the people’s deliverance, entreating Heaven for their fate.

At that time, the land’s heroes, talents, and valiant men lay exposed in the wilds and marshes—those surpassing a thousand were called *talents*, a hundred *heroes*, and ten thousand *valiant*. They advanced beneath arrows and stones, and behind them lay ravines and gullies. Emerging from a hundred deaths to grasp a single life, they contended for the world’s power. *Lay* means to fall; *grasp* means to reach, pronounced like *dai* in *rengdai*. They roused their martial spirit and steeled their resolve to decide their fate in a single day.

At that time, those who wore flowing robes and wide sashes while discoursing on the teachings of the Ru and Mo were deemed unworthy—this spoke to the valor of the age. By the time the violent chaos was overcome—*overcome* meaning to vanquish the violent chaos—the realm was greatly pacified. The legacy of King Wen was continued, and the achievements of King Wu were established—King Wen’s legacy was the Mandate he received, and King Wu’s achievements were the punishment of the unrighteous. The maps and registers of the Son of Heaven were trodden, and the Liu clan’s ceremonial cap was fashioned—Gaozu crafted a bamboo-skin cap at Xinfeng, one style called the *Weimao* cap. The scholars of Zou and Lu, the Ru and Mo, were gathered, and the teachings of the former sages were transmitted. The Son of Heaven’s banner was raised, the grand chariot mounted, the nine streamers unfurled, the great bells struck, the sounding drums beaten, the *Xianchi* performed, and the *Ganqi* dance enacted, as recorded in the *Rites of Zhou*.

The *Great Chariot* is the supreme chariot. When a king’s achievements are complete, he creates music, hence the striking of bells and beating of drums. *Xianchi* is the music of the Yellow Emperor. *Gan* refers to shields, and *qi* to axes—these are the implements held by dancers in spring and summer.

At this time, those who established martial rule were viewed with suspicion. *Suspicion* here means doubt. Within a single generation, civil and martial governance alternated in dominance, each employed as the times required. Yet in the present age, those who practice martial rule dismiss civil governance, while those who uphold civil governance dismiss martial rule. They mutually condemn one another, unaware of the demands of their era. This is like seeing only a corner of a room and remaining ignorant of the vastness of the eight directions. *A corner of a room* refers to a confined space, narrow and small; *the eight directions* signify the boundless expanse of the eight cardinal points. Thus, one who faces east cannot see the western wall, and one who looks south cannot perceive the north—only one who turns toward nothingness can comprehend all directions. *Turning toward nothingness* means perceiving the four quarters, hence the saying: "There is nothing it does not penetrate."

A state endures through virtue and power; when virtue and power are enacted, the people delight in their transformation, and so the state endures. A household perishes through the obstruction of principle. *Principle* is the Way. Yao ruled without a walled city of a hundred households, and Shun possessed not even land enough to plant an awl, yet they held all under Heaven. Yu had no following of ten men, and Tang no domain of seven *li*, yet they reigned over the feudal lords. King Wen dwelled between Qi and Zhou with a territory no larger than a hundred *li*, yet he rose to become the Son of Heaven—this was because he possessed the kingly Way. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and King Wen all ruled all under Heaven. As Mencius said, "Those who practice virtue and benevolence become kings without waiting"—this is the same principle.

In their heyday, the might of Jie of Xia and Zhou of Yin extended wherever human footsteps reached, wherever boats and chariots traveled, all made into commanderies and counties. Yet they died at the hands of others and became laughingstocks of the world—this was because they bore the signs of ruin. As Mencius said, "They loathed death and delighted in unrighteousness; unrighteousness must lead to death," hence the saying: "They bore the signs of ruin."

Thus, the sage observes transformations to discern their omens. *Omens* signify fulfillment. When virtue waxes or wanes, the winds of change first appear. *Winds* refer to *qi*; *appear* means to manifest. Those of abundant virtue—such as King Wen—were foreseen by Boyi and the Grand Duke. Those of declining virtue—such as Jie—were first abandoned by the Grand Scribe Zhong Gu and Xiang Yi.

Therefore, those who attain the kingly Way, though small, will surely grow great—Tang and Wu are examples. Those who bear the signs of ruin, though established, will surely fall—Jie and Zhou are examples. When Xia was about to perish, the Grand Scribe Zhong Gu first fled to Shang; three years later, Jie was destroyed—Tang overthrew him. When Yin was about to collapse, the Grand Scribe Xiang Yi first submitted to King Wen; a year later, Zhou was annihilated—King Wu destroyed him. Thus, the sage perceives the traces of survival and ruin, the junctures of success and failure, not merely at the wilds of Mingtiao or on the day of Jiazi. Tang vanquished Jie and captured him at Mingtiao; King Wu punished Zhou and triumphed on the day of Jiazi.

Now, if the strong prevail by measuring land and counting multitudes, and the wealthy profit by weighing grain and gold, then every lord of a thousand chariots would become a hegemon or king, and every state of ten thousand chariots would face destruction. The traces of survival and ruin would be so easily discerned that even fools and simple women could discuss them. *Fools* here means dull-witted, lacking intelligence.

Zhao Xiangzi made Jinyang his bastion of hegemony, while Zhi Bo was captured with the lands of the Three Jin. *Zhi Bo* refers to Zhi Xian; *Xiangzi* is Wuxu. The Three Jin—Zhi, Han, and Wei—were united under Zhi Bo, who led the lords of Han and Wei to besiege Zhao Xiangzi at Jinyang. Zhao Xiangzi sent Zhang Mengtan to negotiate with Han and Wei, who then turned against Zhi Bo, crushing his army and taking his head to fashion a drinking vessel—hence the saying: "captured with the lands of the Three Jin." King Min of Qi perished with his great state, slain by Chunshen. Tian Dan achieved merit at Jimo. When Yan invaded Qi and conquered it, seizing seventy cities, only Jimo remained unconquered. Tian Dan, a market officer, led the people of Jimo to strike the Yan forces and defeated them—thus he was able to achieve merit.

Therefore, the fall of a state, though vast, is not to be relied upon—even the great may perish, as Zhi Bo did. The practice of the Way, though small, must not be taken lightly. Tang ruled with seventy *li*, and King Wen with a hundred *li*, yet both held all under Heaven—thus, though small, it must not be taken lightly.

From this, we see that survival lies in attaining the Way, not in greatness. A lord who attains the Way, though small, can do good and rule all under Heaven—hence it is said: "not in greatness." Ruin lies in losing the Way, not in smallness. A lord without the Way, though small, persists in evil without reform, and accumulation leads to ruin—hence it is said: "not in smallness."

The *Book of Songs* says:
*"Then gazing westward, he turned his regard,
This alone shall be our dwelling."*
This speaks of departing Yin and moving to Zhou. Zhou ruled from Chaoge in the east, while King Wen’s state lay in Qi and Zhou in the west. Heaven then turned its regard to the western lands, saying, "This alone shall be our dwelling"—hence the saying: "departing Yin and moving to Zhou."

Thus, the rulers of disordered states strive to expand their territories but neglect benevolence and righteousness; they seek to elevate their positions but disregard virtue and power. In doing so, they abandon what sustains them and create the conditions for their own ruin.

Jie was imprisoned at Jiaomen yet did not reproach his own conduct—he did not condemn the evil of his actions—but only regretted not killing Tang at the Summer Terrace. *Terrace* is sometimes written as *Palace*. Zhou was confined at Xuan Hall yet did not repent his faults—*repent* means to feel remorse—but only regretted not executing King Wen at Youli. *Regret* here means resentment. Youli is present-day Tangyin in Henan.

"Yǒu" is an ancient term for "prison warden." When these two rulers held overwhelming power and authority, had they cultivated the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, Tang and Wu would not have had the means to execute their punitive campaigns—how could any plot against them have succeeded? These two rulers refer to Jie and Zhou. While they reigned, their might and dominance blinded them to the wrongness of their own conduct. Had they but practiced the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, Tang and Wu would not have dared devise schemes to execute them.

Yet when they threw into chaos the brilliance of the Three Luminaries above and lost the hearts of the myriad people below—the Three Luminaries being the sun, moon, and stars—even without Tang and Wu, who could not have seized their thrones? This means that any capable person could have overthrown them; it need not have been Tang or Wu. Now, instead of examining their own conduct, they turned to guard against others. They failed to cultivate their own virtue and power, yet sought to defend against the world’s condemnation. The world does not have only one Tang or Wu—kill one, and another will surely follow.

Moreover, Tang and Wu, though small and weak, could attain kingship because they possessed the Dao. Jie and Zhou, though strong and dominant, were overthrown because they lacked the Dao. Now, instead of practicing what leads to kingship, they only compounded what leads to their own downfall—this is the path to ruin.

When King Wu conquered Yin, he wished to build a palace on the Mountain of the Five Phases. This Mountain of the Five Phases is present-day Mount Taihang, located north of Heyang County in Henan, at the Shangdang Pass. The Duke of Zhou said, "This cannot be done. The Mountain of the Five Phases is a place of solid barriers and perilous terrain. If our virtue can encompass it, the world will submit its tribute and service, though the journey be circuitous and difficult. *Circuitous* is sometimes written as *certain*. *Certain* means *inevitable*. But if we act with violence and disorder, the world will find it difficult to attack us." The Duke of Zhou meant that if they acted with violence and disorder, the world would come to punish them, and there would be no need to rely on the Mountain of the Five Phases to make their attackers’ task difficult. This is to say, they should rely on virtue, not on terrain. This is why the Zhou dynasty endured for thirty-six generations without being overthrown. The Duke of Zhou could truly be called one who "held fullness." *Fullness* means being full yet not overflowing. Hence the saying: "able to hold fullness."

Formerly, the *Book of Zhou* stated: "The words of superiors are put into practice by inferiors; the words of inferiors are put into practice by superiors. Approval and disapproval complement one another. The words of superiors are the constant; they are the constant of the ruler. The words of inferiors are the expedient; this is the art of survival and ruin. *Expedient* means *strategy*—weighing circumstances and acting without losing the Dao. Only the sage can master the expedient."

To speak and be invariably trustworthy, to set a time and invariably meet it—these are the highest conduct in the world. Yet when the upright man of She, whose father had stolen a sheep, bore witness against him—the upright man was a native of Ye County in Chu—Zigao, the Viscount of Ye, said to Confucius, "In my village there is an upright man: when his father stole a sheep, his son bore witness against him." Confucius replied, "The upright in my village differ from this. Fathers cover for their sons, and sons cover for their fathers—uprightness lies therein." *Stealing* refers to taking livestock that comes of its own accord. Weisheng made an appointment with a woman and died for it. Weisheng was a man of Lu who had arranged to meet a woman beneath a bridge; when the waters rose, he drowned. To be upright and testify against one’s father, to be trustworthy and drown for an appointment—though one may possess uprightness and trustworthiness, who could esteem such conduct?

To falsify orders in the Three Armies is a grave transgression. When Duke Mu of Qin raised troops to raid Zheng, he passed through Zhou on his eastward march. To attack a state with troops without sounding the drums—stealthily—is called *raiding*. Zhou was the royal capital. The *Gongyang Commentary* states: "The royal capital is Zhou west of the River," referring to present-day Henan County. The Zheng merchant Xian Gao was driving cattle westward to sell when he encountered the Qin army between Zhou and Zheng. He then falsified the orders of the Earl of Zheng, presenting twelve cattle to provision the Qin troops and hosting them as guests, thereby turning them back. *Falsifying* means claiming an order that was not given. *Provisioning* with wine and meat is called *xiang*; with cattle and sheep, *kao*—reviving what is withered. The Qin army said, "We have marched a thousand *li* to raid them, but the distant lord is prepared and our forces have no reinforcements. It would be better to return." They then withdrew their troops and departed, hence the saying "turned them back." Thus, he preserved the state of Zheng.

Therefore, in some matters, trustworthiness becomes transgression, and falsehood becomes merit. *Trustworthiness becoming transgression* refers to Weisheng; *falsehood becoming merit* refers to Xian Gao. What is meant by "acting contrary to ritual yet achieving great merit"? Formerly, when King Gong of Chu fought at Yinling—King Gong battled Duke Li of Jin at Yinling—Lü Qi shot King Gong in the eye and captured him. Because he later mended his ways, he was called *Gong* (Respectful). Pan Wang, Yang Youji, Huang Shuaiwei, and Gongsun Bing conspired to rescue him. These four were ministers of Chu. *Shuai* is read like *sheng* in *shengwei* (rope’s end); *wei* is read like *wen* in *wencao* (to wipe sincerely). King Gong, terrified, lost his composure; his dignity and bearing were not as usual, and he could not rise from his seat. Huang Shuaiwei lifted his foot and kicked the king’s body, whereupon King Gong awoke. Enraged by this breach of ritual, he roused himself and stood, and the four ministers carried him away. *Breach of ritual* refers to lifting one’s foot and kicking the ruler.

Formerly, Cangwu Rao took a wife of surpassing beauty and yielded her to his elder brother—this is what is called "loyal and loving yet impracticable." Cangwu Rao was a contemporary of Confucius. Because his wife was beautiful, he offered her to his elder brother. Though this was loving toward his brother, it violated the principle of honoring close kin and observing proper order, hence the saying "impracticable."

Thus, the sage, in judging the twists and turns of affairs, adapts to them with flexibility, bending and rising without fixed form. At times, he is lowly, weak, and pliant as rushes and leather—not from cowardice or submission. At others, he is firm, strong, and fiercely resolute, his aspirations soaring to the blue clouds—not from innate arrogance. This is to seize the moment and respond to change.

In the intercourse between ruler and minister, bowing the knee and lowering the body serve to express mutual respect and propriety. Yet when peril presses, one may raise a foot to trample the ruler’s person—none in the world would condemn this. Thus, where loyalty resides, ritual propriety cannot constrain it.

When a filial son serves his parents, he softens his countenance and humbles his posture, bearing their sash and adjusting their shoes—*yun* means to turn or adjust. But if they fall into the water, he seizes their hair to pull them out—*zheng* means to lift or rescue, for one rescues from drowning. He does not dare arrogance or disrespect; he acts to save their lives. Thus, when a father drowns, one seizes his hair; when praying, one names the ruler. Mencius said, "If one’s sister-in-law drowns and one does not rescue her, one is a jackal or wolf—how much more so for father or elder brother?" Hence, when drowning occurs, one rescues; when praying, one names the ruler. The Zhou people, in their reverence for the divine, avoided naming the ruler in prayers—yet circumstances leave no alternative. This is where expediency is applied.

Thus Confucius said, "One may study together, yet not be fit to follow the Way." *Shi* means to go; the Way is the virtuous path of benevolence and righteousness. "One may follow the Way, yet not be fit to stand." To stand is to establish virtue, merit, and teachings. "One may stand, yet not be fit to exercise expediency." Expediency is what only the sage perceives.

Thus, one who first resists and later conforms is said to understand expediency. *Wu* means to oppose or diverge; expediency adapts to circumstances, weighing light and heavy without fixed form, transforming the ugly into the good and aligning with what is fitting. Only the sage perceives this. One who conforms first and later errs is said not to understand expediency. Those who do not understand it turn good into ugliness.

Thus ritual is the flower of substance and the ornament of pretense. When pressed by sudden peril or dire straits, it has no use—ritual is of no avail. Therefore, the sage engages the world with formality but acts in accordance with what is fitting. He does not cling to a single path, rigid and unyielding. Thus he fails little and succeeds much; his commands are obeyed throughout the world, and none can condemn them.

To cling is to be bound. The *xingxing*—a beast of the northern lands, with a human face and animal body, yellow in color—knows what has passed but not what is to come. As the *Records of Ritual* says, "The *xingxing* can speak, yet remains a beast of the wild. Seeing people pass, it learns their names—this is knowing what has passed."

The *xingxing* also has a fondness for wine. People use wine to trap it, and once it drinks, it cannot stop—unaware of when it will become drunk, it is thus captured. Hence it is said to be unable to know what is to come.

The *ganhu*—the magpie—knows what is to come but not what has passed. When a person is about to encounter an omen of sorrow or joy, the *ganhu* cries out; this is knowing what is to come. It knows that years with frequent winds will lead it to build nests on the branches of trees, where people will steal its eggs. Hence it is said to be unable to know what has passed. *Gan* is read as in "dry" (*ganzao*); *hu* is read as in "retreat" (*gaotui*).

Such is the distinction between long and short foresight.

In ancient times, Chang Hong was the master of calculations in the Zhou court. Chang Hong was a minister of King Jing of Zhou. He was versed in the *shu*—the arts of the calendar. The qi of Heaven and Earth, the movements of the sun and moon, the changes of wind and rain, and the numbers of pitch-pipes and calendars—there was nothing he did not comprehend. Yet he could not foresee his own fate, and died by dismemberment. During the rebellion of Fan and Zhonghang clans in Jin, he had betrayed his lord. The Liu clan of Zhou had long been intermarried with the Fan clan of Jin, and Chang Hong served Duke Wen of Liu, so the people of Zhou aided the Fan clan. In the twenty-eighth year of King Jing, the people of Jin reproached Zhou, and Zhou executed Chang Hong to appease them. Thus it is said he could not foresee his own fate and died by dismemberment.

Su Qin was a commoner who traveled on foot. With a leather satchel and a humble canopy, he managed the affairs of rulers of ten thousand chariots and secured the compliance of the feudal lords. Yet he could not escape the disaster of dismemberment. Su Qin was a man of Luoyang. *Ying* refers to a leather satchel; *gai* refers to a walking canopy. Su Qin became chief minister of Zhao, which enfeoffed him as Lord Wu’an. Initially, he carried a satchel and a canopy, traveling to persuade the rulers of ten thousand chariots. He formed the Vertical Alliance of the eastern mountains, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation, and none could resist him. He made the feudal lords submit, and none dared refuse. Thus it is said he secured the compliance of the feudal lords but could not escape the disaster of dismemberment. This is discussed in the chapter on persuasive speech.

Here ends the twentieth scroll of the *Huainan Honglie Jie*, recorded by Minister of the Grand Commandant and Libationer Xu Shen.

Here begins a general discourse on instruction:

King Xu of Xu clothed himself in kindness and benevolence, conducting himself with humanity and justice. Thirty-two states on land came to pay court to him. Yet he perished, his state was destroyed, and his descendants were wiped out. In an age of decline and chaos, King Xu cultivated humanity and justice, yet made no military preparations. The King of Chu annihilated him, and thus he perished along with his state. As the *Seven Admonitions* states: "King Wen of Jing erred, and Xu perished"—this is the case.

Minister Zhong assisted and guided King Goujian of Yue, aiding him in avenging grievances and wiping away shame. He captured the person of Fuchai, expanding territory by thousands of *li*. Yet in the end, he was forced to take his own life with the *shulou* sword. Goujian, deploying his stratagems, exacted vengeance upon King Fuchai of Wu, gaining a thousand *li* of land. Yet in the end, the King of Yue grew suspicious of him and presented him with the *shulou* to die. The *shulou* is a sharp sword. Another account says: a long sword with a deer-horn-shaped pommel, its tip dragging on the ground, trailing as one walks.

These men all grasped the mechanisms of order and chaos—*ji* meaning the essential point—yet did not know the means to preserve their nature. Thus, Chang Hong understood the Way of Heaven but not human affairs; Su Qin knew stratagems but not fortune and misfortune; King Xu of Xu knew humanity and justice but not timing; Minister Zhong knew loyalty but not planning. They did not know how to plan for themselves.

The sage is not thus. He assesses the age and acts accordingly, weighing matters and devising plans. Thus, he can extend his influence across the world without constraint, and apply it in the smallest matters without obstruction. *Not constrained* means that in great matters, he can act greatly. Eight *chi* make a *xun*; twice a *xun* makes a *chang*. In small matters, he can act small, without causing urgency or blockage.

If the world falls into desolation and chaos, ritual and justice are severed, the web of governance collapses, the strong oppress the weak, force is used to seize and plunder, minister and lord are indistinguishable, noble and base lack order, armor breeds wax-moths and lice—*cheng* meaning to ride upon, *rang* meaning to level—*breeding wax-moths and lice* means they never leave the body. Swallows and sparrows nest in tents and curtains—*wo* meaning a tent, *chu* meaning to dwell like a bird in its nest. Yet if warfare does not cease, and only then does one begin to adopt the demeanor of reverent restraint—*shuyu* describing a respectful and cautious appearance—and practice the rites of humility and frugality, one will surely be suppressed and unable to rise.

If the world is at peace, governance and education are harmonious, the hundred clans are respectful and harmonious, superiors and inferiors are affectionate toward one another, and only then does one begin to display arrogance and self-importance—*jin* meaning self-aggrandizement—and exert one’s strength and courage, one will surely not escape the laws of the authorities.

Thus, the sage is capable of both yin and yang, both weakness and strength. He moves or remains still according to the times, establishes merit based on available resources, perceives the return of things when they move, and discerns change when matters first sprout. When transformation occurs, he provides its image; when the course shifts, he responds accordingly. Thus, he acts throughout his life without ever encountering difficulty.

Therefore, there are matters that can be done but cannot be spoken of, matters that can be spoken of but cannot be done, matters that are easy to undertake but difficult to complete, and matters that are difficult to complete but easy to ruin.

What can be done but cannot be spoken of is the choice between advancing and retreating. What can be spoken of but cannot be done is deceit and falsehood. What is easy to undertake but difficult to complete is affairs. What is difficult to complete but easy to ruin is reputation. These four strategies are what the sage alone perceives and pays heed to.

To dig an inch to extend a foot—the sage does this. An inch is small, a foot is large. To bend slightly to achieve great straightness—the noble person practices this. *Bent* means crooked; *straight* means aligning with the Way.

The Duke of Zhou bore the burden of killing his younger brother—he executed Guan and Cai. Duke Huan bore the reputation of contending for the state—he entered first from Ju and killed Prince Jiu. Yet the Duke of Zhou mended the breach with righteousness, aiding King Cheng to bring about great peace, returning governance after seven years and facing north as a minister. Thus it is said he mended the breach with righteousness. Duke Huan obliterated disgrace with merit, establishing the achievement of uniting the feudal lords nine times and correcting the world, erasing the evil of contending for the state. Both were deemed worthy.

If one were to obscure a person’s great virtues because of minor faults, then the world would have no sage-kings or worthy ministers. Thus, a blemish in the eye does not impair vision—it cannot be burned away. *Blemish* means a growth; *burn* means to cauterize. An ailment in the throat does not obstruct breathing—it cannot be chiseled away. *Chisel* means to bore through. The burial mounds along the Yellow River are innumerable, yet the land remains easy to cultivate. This means that though the land along the river is not naturally suited for burial mounds, there is still much land that is easy to cultivate. Speaking broadly, this illustrates that in all things, the many often obscure the few.

When water is stirred, waves arise, with high and low points facing one another. Though they differ by a *xun* or a *chang*, it is still considered level. Even with surging waves, it is still deemed level because levelness is the norm. Just as oranges and pomelos grow in winter, people say they die in winter—because the dead are many. Shepherd’s purse and wheat die in summer, yet people say they grow in summer—because the living are many.

Formerly, Caozi led the troops of Lu into battle three times without victory, losing a thousand *li* of land. Had Caozi not considered the consequences, not turned his heels, and cut his throat in the ranks, he would have spent his life as a defeated general and captured commander. Yet Caozi was not ashamed of his defeat; he was ashamed to die without merit. At the Alliance of Ke, he brandished a three-*chi* blade, pressing it against Duke Huan’s chest. The land lost in three battles was recovered in a single morning. His courage was renowned throughout the world, and his merit was established in the state of Lu—restoring the fields of Wenyang.

Guan Zhong assisted Prince Jiu but could not bring his cause to fruition—*sui* meaning to succeed. He cannot be called wise. He fled and fled, yet did not die for his lord’s peril—not dying for Prince Jiu’s crisis. He cannot be called brave. Bound in fetters and shackles, he did not conceal his shame. He cannot be called steadfast. Possessing these three qualities, even a commoner would not befriend him, and a ruler would not employ him. A scholar would not consider him a worthy friend, and a ruler would not deem him a righteous minister. Yet Guan Zhong emerged from his bonds and fetters to establish the governance of the state of Qi, uniting the feudal lords nine times and correcting the world.

Had Guan Zhong chosen to die, sacrificing his life without regard for future plans, how could he have achieved such hegemonic merit? Now, when rulers assess their ministers, if they do not weigh their great accomplishments but instead tally their minor conduct and demand petty virtues, they will lose the method for recognizing worthies. *Lüe* means "great"; *small goodness* refers to loyalty; *shu* means "method." Thus, one who possesses profound virtue should not be questioned for minor flaws, and one who enjoys great renown should not be faulted for trivial faults.

A puddle in an ox’s hoofprint cannot nurture sturgeon or *wei*-fish. *Cen* refers to rainwater that collects in the imprint of an ox’s hoof—so small it cannot sustain sturgeon or *wei*. The sturgeon is a great fish, over a *zhang* in length, with fine scales, a yellow head, white body, and a short snout, its mouth beneath its belly. The *wei* is also a great fish, over a *zhang* long, which in the second month of spring swims upstream from the western river; if it passes through the Dragon Gate, it transforms into a dragon. This is according to the teachings of the former masters. A wasp’s nest cannot contain a swan’s egg—its chamber is too small to hold such a large body.

In human nature, none are without shortcomings. If one’s great strategy is sound, even with minor faults, they are not enough to be a hindrance. Assess their true substance, overlook their conduct. If their great strategy is flawed, even with the conduct of a village worthy, it is not enough for grand employment. *Ju* means "to employ."

Yan Hui Ju was a great bandit of Liangfu—Liangfu being a town in Qi, now part of Mount Tai—and yet he became a loyal minister to Qi. Duan Ganmu was a great broker of Jin, yet he became the teacher of Marquis Wen. *Zang* means "arrogant and haughty"; another saying holds that *zang* refers to a market broker, meaning he was a great broker of the state of Wei. Meng Mao married his sister-in-law and had five sons with her, yet he served as minister to Wei, securing its peril and resolving its crises. Meng Mao was originally a man of Qi. When he served Wei, he stabilized its endangered state, a feat of great merit. The *Strategies of the Warring States* refers to him as Mang Mao. Jing Yang indulged in wine, letting his hair loose as he rode in a carriage with women, yet his might subdued the feudal lords. Jing Yang was a general of Chu.

These four men all had their shortcomings, yet their fame and merit did not fade because their great strategies succeeded. *Lüe* here means "the Way." Ji Xiang and Chen Zhongzi upheld their principles and maintained unyielding conduct, refusing to enter the courts of corrupt rulers or consume the food of a disordered age, and so they starved to death. Ji Xiang was a man of Lu and a disciple of Confucius; Chen Zhongzi was a man of Qi and a disciple of Mencius, who lived in Julu. Why could they not preserve what was perishing or revive what was broken? Their minor virtues were upheld, but their great strategies were abandoned. *Shen* means "to employ"; *qu* means "to discard."

Thus, those who are overly cautious achieve no great success, and those who slander others’ conduct are not tolerated by the multitude. Those who delight in concealing others’ virtues and broadcasting their faults, who disparage others’ conduct and hide in self-imposed humility, are detested by the people and not accepted. Another interpretation holds that *zi* means "to slander"; those whose conduct is flawed are not tolerated by the multitude.

One of great stature has loose joints; one with large feet strides far. *Shu* means "long"; *zhi* means "foot"; *ju* means "large." From ancient times to the present, the Five Emperors and Three Kings have never been without imperfections in their conduct. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says, "Minor faults bring prosperity; it is favorable to be steadfast." It means that no one is without faults, but one should not allow them to become great.

Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu were the most eminent rulers of their ages; Qi Huan and Jin Wen were the finest heroes among the Five Hegemons. Yet Yao bore the reputation of being unfilial—meaning he did not pass the throne to his son Dan Zhu. Shun was slandered for humiliating his father—meaning Gusou was reduced to the status of a commoner. Tang and Wu were involved in the exile and regicide of their sovereigns—Tang exiled Jie to Nanchao, and Wu killed Zhou in the Hall of Audience. The Five Hegemons harbored violent and disorderly schemes. Qi Huan, Jin Wen, Song Xiang, Chu Zhuang, and Qin Mu—though their virtue was not pure, all showed signs of contention and usurpation, hence it is said they harbored violent and disorderly schemes.

Therefore, the noble person does not demand perfection from any one individual. They are upright but do not cut, honest but not harsh, broadly learned but not disparaging, both civil and martial but not demanding. Civil and martial virtues should be complete, but one should not demand perfection from others. When seeking from one person, employ them according to their abilities—assign tasks within their capacity. In self-cultivation, rely on the Dao and virtue.

To demand of others according to their abilities is easy to repay; to cultivate oneself with the Dao and virtue is difficult to achieve. What is difficult to achieve elevates one’s conduct; what is easy to repay satisfies one’s demands. The jade tablet of the Xia dynasty cannot be without flaws—*zhang* refers to a half-*gui*, a precious jade of the Xia. *Kao* means "blemish." The luminous pearl cannot be without knots—*mingyue* refers to a pearl that shines like moonlight. *Chan* means "knot," like the tangles in silk thread. Yet the world treasures them—why? Their minor flaws do not detract from their great beauty.

If one records only the shortcomings of the worthy and ignores their cultivated virtues, seeking to find the most capable under heaven, it will be difficult indeed. Bai Li Xi herded cattle, Yi Yin carried the cauldron—Yi Yin carried the cutting board and cauldron, preparing the five flavors to present to Tang, and ultimately became a worthy minister. Taigong plied his knife—Taigong was a man of Ji in Henan. He endured the hardships of butchery and fishing, yet ultimately became an assistant to King Wen and aided King Wu in overthrowing Zhou. Ning Qi sang his merchant’s song—Ning Qi was a man of Wei who traveled as a merchant to Qi. He lodged outside the outer gate of the capital and, lamenting the age, sang a merchant’s song to present himself to Duke Huan. Duke Huan welcomed him in the night and, upon hearing his song, appointed him Grand Minister of Agriculture. The details of his song are recorded in the *Daoist Responses* and *Explanations*. His virtues were preserved therein.

The multitude sees only their lowly positions and base occupations and, not recognizing their great strategies, deems them unworthy.

When they became Son of Heaven, the Three Dukes, or were established as worthy ministers and lords of the feudal states, only then did the multitude come to believe in their distinction. *Believe* here means *to know*.

Some emerged from among the cauldrons and chopping blocks—this was Yi Yin. Others came forth from the shops of butchers and wine-sellers—*shops* meaning market stalls—this was Lü Shang, the Grand Duke. Some were freed from bonds and fetters—*bonds and fetters* being the means to restrain men—this was Guan Zhong. Others rose from beneath the jaws of oxen—*rose* meaning *to arise*—this was Bai Li Xi. *Jaws* is read as the *he* in *hesuo*. They were bathed in scalding waters and purified with the sacred flame, then established at the forefront of the royal court and entrusted with the rank of the Three Dukes. *Sacred flame* refers to the fire-official who kindles flame from the sun. According to the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Director of Sacred Fire* oversees the proper use of fire. Fire is employed to dispel inauspicious influences. *Established* means *to place*. *Royal court* refers to the court of the state. Within, they felt no shame before their nation; without, they bore no disgrace before the feudal lords. Their authority aligned with their inner harmony, for their inner harmony accorded with their lord.

Thus, some recognized worthiness before any merit was shown—Yao’s recognition of Shun. Others knew worthiness only after deeds were accomplished and affairs established—the commoners’ recognition of Shun. If one were to abandon standards and measures and seek worthies among the courts, markets, and wilds, the loss of true talent would surely be great. If a ruler, relying solely on his own ears and eyes and keen discernment to find worthy men, ceased to employ the art of measurement in selecting people and instead hastily sought worthies among the ranks of courts and markets or in the untamed wilds, he would inevitably miss many worthy men—how could he claim to be seeking worthies?

Why is this so? He may imitate the act of seeking, yet he does not understand the principles of selection. For things that resemble one another are what confuse the rulers of the age, and those that are ambiguous or bear a likeness dazzle the multitude. *Resemblance* and *likeness* refer to things that appear similar yet differ in substance, such as white bones resembling ivory, green jasper resembling jade, or snake bed resembling *miwu* herb.

Thus, the cunning may resemble the wise yet not be wise—the cunning rely on their own devices, appearing knowledgeable but lacking true wisdom. The foolish may resemble the benevolent yet not be benevolent—the foolish, unable to make decisive judgments, may seem kind but lack true benevolence. The dull-witted may resemble the brave yet not be brave—the dull-witted, unaware of danger, may seem courageous but lack true bravery.

If people were as distinct as jade from stone, beauty from ugliness, then judging them would be easy. But those who confuse others are like *xiongqiong* and *gaoben*, or snake bed and *miwu*—all appear similar. Though they resemble one another, their fragrance and stench differ, just as petty men may resemble gentlemen, yet their benevolence—or lack thereof—sets them apart.

Thus, a swordsmith may forge a blade resembling *Moye*, yet only Ou Ye could name its true nature. *Ou Ye* was a master smith. A jade-worker may be dazzled by jade resembling *bilu*, yet only Qi Dun could discern its true quality. *Bilu* is sometimes said to be *wufen*. *Qi Dun* was a wealthy man of Lu who understood the principles of jade and never erred in his judgments. A benighted ruler, confused by treacherous ministers and petty men who cast doubt on the gentleman, can only be enlightened by a sage who perceives the subtle and knows the manifest.

Thus, when a snake raises its head a foot, its full length can be known. When an elephant bares its tusk, its size can be judged. The son of Zhu Yong from Biju, seeing the scales of a fox on a sword, could discern its sharpness or dullness. *Biju* was a town in Qi. The son of the Zhu Yong family was skilled in recognizing fine swords. Yu’er, Yi Ya, and the waters of Zhi and Mian—when these converge, one sip reveals their sweetness or bitterness. *Yu’er* and *Yi Ya* were connoisseurs of taste from Qi. *Sip* means *to taste with the mouth*.

Therefore, when a sage judges worthiness, observing a single action suffices to distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. Confucius declined the fief of Linqiu, refusing even a thief’s hook. *Linqiu* was a town in Qi—now part of Jiyin—where Duke Jing of Qi supported Confucius. Because his words went unheeded and his Way remained unrealized, Confucius declined the stipend, refusing even to profit from a thief’s hook. Xu You declined the throne, never coveting a marquisate. *Xu You* was a recluse from Yangcheng. Yao wished to yield the world to him, but he washed his ears and refused, hence his disdain for a marquisate.

Thus, one who has never been burned dares not grasp fire, for he sees its burning power. One who has never been cut dares not seize a blade, for he sees its harmful edge. From this, we see that observation can judge what has not yet occurred, and examining small details suffices to know the greater whole.

Therefore, the way to judge a person is this: when noble, observe whom he promotes; when wealthy, observe whom he aids; when impoverished, observe what he refuses; when base, observe what he will not do; when poor, observe what he will not take. Test him in adversity to know his courage; observe his conduct in joy to gauge his steadfastness; entrust him with wealth to assess his character; shake him with fear to know his discipline. Thus, the full range of human nature is revealed.

The ancients who were skilled in reward spent little yet encouraged many—this was the way of the two actions of Zhao Xiang. Those skilled in punishment used few penalties yet suppressed villainy—this was the way of King Wei of Qi. Those skilled in giving bestowed sparingly yet conferred great virtue—this was the way of Duke Mu of Qin. Those skilled in taking received much yet incurred no resentment—this was the way of Duke Huan of Qi.

When Zhao Xiangzi was besieged in Jinyang, upon lifting the siege, he rewarded five men for their merit, with Gao He ranked first. His attendants asked, “During the siege of Jinyang, Gao He performed no great deed. Why is he now first in reward?” Before this, the Viscount of Zhi had demanded land from Zhao Xiangzi, who refused. The Viscount then led Han and Wei to besiege him. After three months without success, Zhao’s minister Zhang Mengtan secretly conspired with Han and Wei, turning against the Viscount of Zhi and killing him—this was the work of Zhang Mengtan.

Thus it is said, Gao He performed no great deed. Xiangzi declared, “During the siege of Jinyang, when my altars of soil and grain were imperiled and the state stood on the brink of ruin, all my ministers harbored thoughts of arrogance and disrespect—only Gao He did not lose the rites of lord and minister. Therefore, by rewarding one man, all under heaven who would be loyal ministers were moved to remain steadfast in their loyalty to their lords. This is how a small reward spurred many to goodness.”

King Wei of Qi placed a great cauldron in his courtyard and summoned the magistrate of Wuyan, saying, “Your praises reach my ears daily.” Yet when he examined your governance, the fields lay fallow, granaries stood empty, and prisons were full—you have served me with deceit.” He then boiled him alive. For thirty-two years thereafter, none in Qi abandoned lost items on the roads. This was how minimal punishment suppressed treachery.

Duke Mu of Qin went on an outing when his chariot broke down; the right-hand horse of the inner pair was lost. Rustics found it, and when the duke pursued them to the southern slopes of Mount Qi, they were butchering and eating it. The duke said, “To eat the flesh of a fine steed without drinking wine afterward harms a man. I fear it may injure you.” He gave them wine to drink all around before departing. A year later, he fought the Battle of Han against Duke Hui of Jin. (This “year later” refers to the year following the feast of horse meat and wine.) Duke Hui of Jin, Yiwu, had betrayed the gifts Qin used to secure his return, so Qin raised an army to attack Jin, clashing with them at Hanyuan in Jin territory. The Jin forces surrounded the duke’s chariot; Liang Youmi seized the duke’s trace horse and captured him. (Liang Youmi was a Jin grandee; *kou* means to lead or pull.) They were about to take the duke prisoner when over three hundred of those who had eaten the horse meat emerged to fight to the death beneath his chariot, enabling him to defeat Jin and capture Duke Hui. This was how sparing use brought great virtue.

Duke Huan of Qi, preparing for a campaign, found his armor and weapons insufficient. He decreed that those guilty of serious crimes could redeem themselves by providing a rhinoceros-hide cuirass and one halberd (the cuirass for its strength; the halberd, a chariot weapon, was sixteen feet long—*xi* may also mean three, referring to three layers of armor). Those guilty of minor offenses could ransom themselves with measured amounts of gold (the amount varying with the severity of the crime). Those who lost lawsuits were to provide a bundle of arrows (twelve arrows to a bundle). The people rejoiced, then straightened arrow shafts into arrows and refined the fletching and points. They smelted metal into blades (the five weapons: sword, knife, spear, halberd, and arrow). With these, he attacked the unjust and punished the lawless, ultimately becoming hegemon of the realm. This was how he received much yet incurred no resentment.

Thus the sage, leveraging what the people love, encourages goodness, and using what they hate, suppresses treachery. Therefore, rewarding one man earns the acclaim of all under heaven, while punishing one man instills fear in all. Thus the ultimate reward is not wasteful (it is given where deserved, not squandered), and the ultimate punishment is not excessive (it is meted out where due, not harming the good). (The character *lan* is read like *lian*, meaning “to restrain.”)

When Confucius executed Shaozheng Mao, the perversity of Lu was blocked. (Shao was an office; Zheng Mao was his name—a flatterer in Lu. Seven days after Confucius became chief minister of Lu, he executed him beneath the eastern gallery—this was punishment without excess.) When Zichan executed Deng Xi, the treachery of Zheng was suppressed. (Deng Xi was the foremost of cunning sophists; when Zichan killed him, treachery ceased. As the tradition states, “Duke Chuan of Zheng executed Deng Xi but adopted his bamboo penal code.” Deng Xi had inscribed his laws on bamboo, and Zheng used them, not discarding the words because of the man.) This illustrates how the near elucidates the far, and the small reveals the great. Thus the sage governs broadly through restraint—this is what it means.

Nothing under heaven is easier than doing good, and nothing harder than doing evil. To do good, one stills the self, eliminates desires, and embraces trust and benevolence, following one’s natural endowment—hence it is easy. To do evil, one is insatiably greedy, harms others to benefit oneself, and violates one’s natural endowment—hence it is difficult. What is called doing good is stillness and non-action; what is called doing evil is restlessness and excessive desire. When one accords with one’s nature, rejects temptation, and preserves one’s true self without alteration, this is why doing good is easy.

To scale city walls, cross perilous passes, forge tallies and seals, steal keys and seals, usurp and assassinate, falsify and slander—these are not the nature of man. (To *jian* is to act in secret, to steal; tallies and seals are tokens of trust, yet one steals them. *Guan* are bolts and locks; *jin* are seals and fastenings, also used for trust. *Cuan* and *shi* mean to plot against one’s superiors. *Jiao* is to falsely issue a lord’s command; *wu* is to cover someone with evil. None of these are the good nature bestowed by Heaven.) Thus it is said that doing evil is difficult.

Now, why do men commit crimes that land them in prison and bring them to the disaster of execution? It is because their cravings are insatiable and they do not follow the measures of propriety. How do we know this? The laws of the realm’s courts state: “Those who rob graves are executed; those who steal are punished.” This is what the authorities oversee. For laws and decrees are nets that catch the treacherous and wicked, while diligent officials track their traces. (The *qin* are the officials who inquire; *shuai* is the great responsibility.) Even the dullest men and women know that treachery cannot escape and that violating prohibitions cannot go unpunished. Yet the worthless, unable to conquer their desires, recklessly incur the crime of death and suffer the shame of execution. (To *meng* is to cover or risk.) Yet after the autumn assizes, the followers of the Minister of Justice tread upon each other’s heels at the gates, and the blood of those executed in the marketplace flows in the streets. Why? They are deluded by the prospect of gain and blinded to the peril of death.

Now, when armies are arrayed and the two sides face each other, the general issues his command: “Those who take heads will be enfeoffed with noble rank, while the cowardly and wavering will be beheaded.”

Yet the soldiers at the front ranks cannot advance to achieve the merit of beheading, for *suì* is to accomplish. Instead, they incur the certain punishment of decapitation—this is to flee from the fear of death only to embrace certain death. Thus the reversal of profit and harm, the proximity of fortune and misfortune, cannot but be examined with care.

Some matters, when pursued, only lead to their loss; others, when avoided, only bring them closer. A man of Chu, caught in a great wind while sailing, threw himself into the waves as the swells rose—not that he did not cherish life or fear death, but that in his terror of death he forgot all about living. Thus are men’s cravings and desires.

A man of Qi stole gold during the bustling market hour, snatched it, and fled. When seized and questioned, he was asked, “Why steal gold in the midst of the crowd?” *Fán* means throng; *lè* refers to the interrogating officer; *gù* means intent; *ér* means you. He replied, “I saw no one—only the gold.” When the mind is fixed on desire, it forgets all else.

Therefore the sage examines the shifts between motion and stillness, adapting to the measure of giving and receiving; he orders the passions of love and hate, harmonizing the bounds of joy and anger. When motion and stillness are balanced, calamity does not exceed; when giving and receiving are fitting, guilt does not accumulate; when love and hate are ordered, sorrow does not draw near; when joy and anger are moderated, resentment does not arise.

Thus the man who has mastered the Way does not grasp at gain, nor decline fortune; what is his he does not cast away, what is not his he does not seek. He is ever full yet never overflows, ever empty yet easily content. *Xū* means desireless.

Now, a trickle of water suffices to fill a gourd or flask, yet the Yangtze and Yellow River cannot fill a leaking goblet—so too is the human heart. One ought to measure by the arts of the Way: eat to fill hunger, clothe to ward off cold, and this suffices to nourish the seven-foot frame. Without the measure of the Way, even the most frugal restraint leaves the might of a thousand chariots insufficient for honor, the wealth of the world insufficient for joy. Witness Jie and Zhou: lacking the measure of the Way, they could not even be common men—what honor or joy did they possess?

Sunshu Ao thrice resigned the post of prime minister without a trace of sorrow, for rank and emolument could not burden him—not allowing them to encumber his person. Jing Ci Fei, with two dragons coiling about his boat, remained unmoved in spirit, for strange phenomena could not startle him—his courage unshaken by confusion.

The sage’s mind is level, his will at ease, his spirit inwardly guarded; no thing can delude him. The drunkard, stooping to enter the city gate, takes it for a seven-foot doorway; leaping the Yangtze or Huai, he mistakes them for a common ditch—wine has muddled his spirit. The coward, seeing a roadside marker at night, takes it for a ghost; seeing a recumbent stone, he takes it for a tiger—fear has stolen his breath. *Yǎn* means to seize. How much less, then, can he face the monstrous things of heaven and earth?

Male and female unite, yin and yang commingle; birds hatch fledglings, beasts bear calves, the soft becomes flesh, the hard becomes teeth and horns—none find this strange. Water gives rise to conches and clams, mountains produce gold and jade—none find this strange. Old locust trees burst into flame, long-buried blood turns to phosphorescence—none find this strange. When the essence of blood lies in the earth, exposed for a hundred days, it becomes phosphorescence, glowing faintly from afar like kindled fire. Mountains bring forth *jiào yáng*, the mountain spirit—human in form, tall and large, black-faced, hairy-bodied, with reversed heels, laughing at the sight of men. Water gives birth to *wǎng xiàng*, the water spirit (as the *Guoyu* says, “The dragon is *wǎng xiàng*”). Trees give rise to *bì fāng*, the tree spirit—shaped like a crow, blue-green, red-footed, one-legged, eating no grain. Wells produce *fén yáng*, the earth spirit (when Lu Ji Zi dug a well, he unearthed an earthen jar containing a sheep). People find these strange only because their experience is shallow and their knowledge of things limited.

The monstrous things of the world are seen only by the sage; the reversals of profit and harm are understood only by the wise. As for similarities, differences, and doubtful matters, these are what confound the common world. What cannot be made known throughout the land, what cannot be clarified for the people—this is why prohibitions are established in response to omens and portents (*jī xiáng* refers to fortune and misfortune; *jìn* means warning), and why symbolic transformations are devised by analogy to physical forms. How do we know this is so?

Common folk say: When offering sacrifice to the Great High One, the pig is the foremost sacrificial beast—the Great High One being the Ancestor, also called the Supreme Lord. When burying the dead, fur garments must not be interred. Those who jest with blades will have their elbows restrained by the Great Ancestor. Those who sleep with their heads resting against a door or threshold will have their heads trampled by ghosts and spirits. None of these are recorded in laws or decrees, nor are they spoken of by the sage.

Why, when sacrificing to the Great High One, is the pig the foremost sacrificial beast? It is not that the pig surpasses wild beasts like elk and deer in worth, yet the numinous spirits partake of it alone. The reason is this: the pig is a creature commonly raised in households and easily obtained, so it is used for its convenience to honor the spirits. Why must fur garments not be buried? It is not that silk and fine cloth are warmer than fur. Rather, fur is a rare and costly commodity—fine cloth being delicate fabric, and fur belonging to creatures like the fox. Thus it is called a costly good. It may be passed down to later generations, bringing no benefit to the dead but sufficing to nurture the living, so it is used for its value to inspire reverence.

Why are those who jest with blades restrained by the Great Ancestor? For those who jest with blades will inevitably make mistakes; mistakes that cause injury bring great harm. Without blood feuds or quarrels, one may yet bring upon oneself punishment and execution through trivial matters—this is what fools fail to avoid. Thus the Great Ancestor is invoked to weigh upon their hearts. Why do ghosts and spirits trample the heads of those who sleep with their heads against doors or thresholds? If ghosts and spirits could work mysterious transformations, they would not wait for doors or windows to pass through. If they followed emptiness to enter and exit, they would be unable to tread upon anything—emptiness meaning apertures. Doors and windows are where wind and qi come and go, and wind and qi are the coarse manifestations of yin and yang. Those who encounter them will surely fall ill. Thus ghosts and spirits are invoked to extend the warning.

All such matters cannot be exhaustively recorded in books or inscribed on bamboo and silk to be stored in government offices. Therefore, they are made clear through omens and portents. For fools who do not recognize harm, the authority of ghosts and spirits is borrowed to amplify the teaching, a practice whose origins are ancient. Yet fools take these as mere omens, while the obstinate dismiss them as false. Only those who possess the Dao can fathom their intent.

In the present age, people sacrifice to wells and hearths, doors and thresholds, dustpans and brooms, mortars and pestles—not because they believe these spirits can partake of the offerings, but because they rely upon their power and are endlessly troubled by their demands. Thus they show gratitude in due season to avoid forgetting their merit.

When struck, a stone yields clouds; when gathered to the breadth of a *cun*, they coalesce, and within a single morning, rain falls across the land—only Mount Tai can do this. Though the land be parched for three years, its streams never cease to flow; though its moisture reaches a hundred *li* to nourish grasses and trees—only the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers can do this. Thus the Son of Heaven ranks them and offers sacrifice to them.

When a horse saves a person from peril, upon its death it is buried. When an ox dies, it is buried with a great cart as an offering. If the merits of oxen and horses cannot be forgotten, how much more so those of the dead? This is why the sage values benevolence and accumulates kindness.

Thus the Flame Emperor, master of fire, upon his death became the hearth god. The Flame Emperor—Shennong, who ruled the world through the power of fire—entrusted his sacrifices to the hearth spirit. Yu toiled for the world and, upon his death, became the earth god, his labor referring to his merit in controlling the floods, entrusting his sacrifices to the spirit of the earth. Hou Ji invented agriculture and, upon his death, became the grain god—Hou Ji being Qi of Zhou. Yi eliminated the world’s harms and, upon his death, became the ancestral spirit of the door. These are the origins of ghosts and spirits.

Yi, an ancient lord, drowned the River Earl who killed people, shooting out his left eye. The Earl of Wind destroyed people’s homes, and Yi shot him through the knee. He also subdued the Nine Serpents, the Devourer, and others, rendering great service to the world. Thus, upon his death, he was entrusted to the ancestral spirit of the door. Sacrifices to fields invoke the ancestral spirit of the door, referring to its emergence. Some say this is the spirit worshipped within the household. Others say it is the Controller of Fate, the one who spreads beside. This refers to Yi of Yao’s time, not the later Yi of the Youqiong clan.

In the northern regions of Chu, there was a knight-errant whose sons and grandsons repeatedly admonished him to cease, but he would not listen. When bandits raided the county and thoroughly searched his home, his crimes were exposed. He fled in terror that night, pursued and overtaken on the road. Those to whom he had shown kindness fought for him, allowing him to escape and return. He said to his sons, “You repeatedly urged me to abandon my knight-errantry. Now in my peril, I relied upon it to save myself. Your admonitions were of no use.” He knew how to escape peril but not how to avoid it in the first place.

To argue thus is truly deluded. There was a man of Song who, when marrying off his daughter, said to her, "The marriage may not be settled. If you are sent away, you must secretly hoard something. If you hoard and grow rich, it will be easier to remarry." His daughter heeded her father’s plan and stole away to hide her possessions. When the lord of the state learned of her theft, he drove her out. Her father did not reproach himself but instead considered his plan successful. He knew how to hide wealth for the possibility of being cast out but did not understand that hiding wealth was the very reason for her expulsion. To argue in this way—is it not perverse?

Now consider the one who hires out oxen for transport. His task is to spare the cart’s burden, exhausting a single ox’s strength. Yet if the axle breaks, he piles more upon the shafts, not realizing that the weight on the shafts is what causes the axle to snap. The King of Chu wore a jade *jue* while hunting hares. When he ran and broke it, he then wore two *jue* as a precaution. But when the two struck together, they broke even faster. Governing a disordered state is much the same.

The owl’s eyes are large, yet it cannot see as well as the mouse in the dark. The centipede has many legs, yet it cannot outrun the snake. Some things are naturally such that the great are not as good as the small, the many not as good as the few. As for the strong becoming weak, the weak becoming strong, the perilous becoming secure, and the doomed enduring—who but the sage can perceive these truths? Great and small, noble and base are not sufficient grounds for judgment. Only that which embodies the Dao is truly precious.

How can this be illustrated? When the Son of Heaven resides in a suburban pavilion, the Nine Ministers hasten, the great officers run, those seated prostrate themselves, and those leaning stand upright. At such a time, even in the Bright Hall or the ancestral temple, where caps are hung and swords removed, belts are loosened and one reclines. It is not that the suburban pavilion is grand and the temple hall cramped, but that the most exalted dwells there. The nobility of the Dao of Heaven is not merely the honor due to the Son of Heaven—wherever it resides, the multitude looks up to it. Even the hibernating insects and magpies’ nests all turn toward the One Heaven, for the supreme harmony dwells there.

If the emperor truly embraces and embodies the Dao, uniting with supreme harmony, then the birds and beasts, the grasses and trees—none will fail to receive his beneficence, let alone the countless people. *Huainan Honglie Jie*, Scroll 20 concludes.

**Explanation of Terms**

*Explanation*: "Explanation" means "to approach." Approaching the subtleties of the myriad things by speaking of their essence—this is what affairs signify and what the Dao depends upon. Penetratingly identical with Heaven and Earth, undifferentiated as uncarved simplicity, it forms things before their creation—this is called the Great One. The Great One is the primordial spirit, the unifier of the myriad things. Though all emerge from the One, their functions differ: there are birds, fish, and beasts—these are called the division of things. By their categories they are distinguished; by their groups they are divided. Nature and destiny differ, yet all take form in being. Separated and uncommunicating, divided into the ten thousand things, none can reach the ancestral origin—meaning the origin of one’s own nature, identical with the penetrating unity. Thus, movement gives rise to life, and death is called exhaustion. All are things, yet not the non-thing that things things. The non-thing that things is indistinct and void. The one who things things does not reside within the ten thousand things. The one who things things is the creator of the ten thousand things—this one does not dwell within the ten thousand things.

Tracing back to the Great Beginning of antiquity, humans are born from non-being and take form in being. Once formed, they are constrained by things. Those who can return to their origin, as if they had never taken form, are called Perfected Persons. The Perfected Person is one who has never been separated from the Great One. The sage does not occupy the position of names—*occupy* means to preside. He is not a repository of schemes, not burdened with tasks, not the master of wisdom. Concealing his formlessness, moving without trace, wandering without sign—*sign* means omen. He does not precede fortune nor initiate misfortune. Abiding in emptiness, he acts only when unavoidable. Those who seek fortune may incur misfortune; those who seek profit may encounter harm. Thus, one who attains tranquility through non-action will face peril if he loses the source of his tranquility; one who governs through non-affair will fall into chaos if he loses the source of his governance.

Stars arrayed in the heavens shine, so people point to them; righteousness arrayed in virtue is manifest, so people observe it. What people point to, when moved, leaves a pattern; what people observe, when acted upon, leaves a trace. Movement with pattern invites judgment; action with trace invites discussion. Therefore, the sage conceals his brightness in non-action and hides his traces in non-doing.

Prince Qingji of Wu died by the sword. Prince Qingji was the nephew of King Liao of Wu. When Helü assassinated Liao, Qingji, brave and strong, fled to Zheng. Helü, fearing him, sent Yao Li to assassinate Qingji. Yi died by the peach-wood club—*club* means a large staff, made of peach wood, used to strike and kill Yi. Since then, ghosts have feared peach wood. Zilu was pickled in Wei; Su Qin died by the mouth. Su Qin, fond of persuasion, was killed by Qi. People all value what they possess and despise what they lack, yet they drown in what they value and exhaust what they despise. What they value has form; what they despise has no sign. Thus, the strength of tigers and leopards invites arrows; the agility of gibbons and monkeys invites capture.

One who can value what he despises and despise what he values may be spoken to of the ultimate discourse. The self-assured cannot be swayed by slander or praise; the content cannot be tempted by power or profit. Thus, one who understands the essence of human nature does not pursue what nature lacks the means to achieve. One who understands the essence of destiny does not worry over what destiny has no way to alter. One who penetrates the Dao finds nothing sufficient to disturb his harmony.

Zhan He said: "Never have I heard of one whose person was well-ordered yet whose state was in chaos; never have I heard of one whose person was in chaos yet whose state was well-ordered." If the carpenter’s square is not true, it cannot make a square; if the compass is not true, it cannot make a circle. The person is the compass and square of affairs—never have I heard of one who, being crooked himself, could make others straight.

Tracing back to the Mandate of Heaven, ordering the mind’s workings, regulating likes and dislikes, and harmonizing the passions and nature—thus the Way of governance is opened. Tracing back to the Mandate of Heaven prevents confusion over fortune and misfortune; ordering the mind’s workings prevents reckless joy and anger; regulating likes and dislikes prevents greed for the useless; harmonizing the passions and nature prevents desires from exceeding moderation. Unconfused by fortune and misfortune, one’s movement and stillness follow principle; without reckless joy and anger, rewards and punishments are not biased; without greed for the useless, one does not harm one’s nature through desire; without desires exceeding moderation, one nurtures one’s nature and knows contentment. These four matters are not sought from without, nor borrowed from others—they are obtained by turning back to oneself.

The world cannot be governed by wisdom, nor by clever discernment, nor by managing affairs, nor by clinging to benevolence, nor by forceful domination. These five are all human talents, yet without abundant virtue, not one of them can be accomplished. When virtue is established, the five are not endangered; when the five appear, virtue has no place. If all five are manifest, virtue has no position to stand. Thus, one who attains the Dao finds even the foolish sufficient; one who loses the Dao finds even the wise inadequate.

Crossing water without knowing how to swim, even the strong will sink; knowing how to swim, even the weak will succeed—how much more so when relying on a boat! The foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people. The foundation of pacifying the people lies in sufficiency of use. The foundation of sufficiency of use lies in not seizing the seasons. The foundation of not seizing the seasons lies in reducing affairs. The foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderating desires. The foundation of moderating desires lies in returning to one’s nature. The foundation of returning to one’s nature lies in shedding burdens—shedding superficial adornments, burdens of what is already lost. Shedding burdens leads to emptiness; emptiness leads to equilibrium. Equilibrium is the plainness of the Dao; emptiness is the abode of the Dao.

One who can possess the world must not lose his state; one who can possess his state must not lose his family; one who can govern his family must not neglect his person; one who can cultivate his person must not forget his mind; one who can trace back to his mind must not harm his nature; one who can preserve his nature must not be deluded by the Dao.

Thus, Guangchengzi said: "Guard carefully within; seal completely without." Guangchengzi was a man of the time of the Yellow Emperor.

Excessive knowledge leads to ruin; neither see nor hear. Embrace the spirit in stillness, and the form will right itself. One who has not mastered himself yet claims to know others—such a thing has never existed. Thus, the *Yi* says: "Tie up the sack—neither blame nor praise." Those who would become overlords must first be victors; those who would be victors must be strong; those who would be strong must employ the strength of others; those who would employ the strength of others must win their hearts; those who would win their hearts must first master themselves; those who would master themselves must be yielding and weak.

Strength prevails over what is weaker than oneself, but when matched with its equal, it meets resistance. When human strength equals one’s own, and one imposes force upon it, conflict arises. Yet yielding prevails over what is stronger than oneself—its power cannot be measured. Thus, only the sage can turn many defeats into a great victory.

A skilled swimmer need not learn to pole a boat yet masters it with ease; one with strong sinews need not learn to ride a horse yet sits astride effortlessly. He who holds the world lightly is not burdened by things, and so can abide in them.

King Tai of ancient times dwelt in Bin when the Di tribes attacked. He offered them furs, silk, pearls, and jade, yet they would not desist. He then took leave of the elders and removed to Qizhou, where the people, carrying their young and supporting their old, followed him. There he established his state. Extending this principle, four generations later, his line came to rule all under Heaven—was this not fitting? Those four generations were Tai Wang, Wang Ji, King Wen, and King Wu.

He who does not treat the world as his possession is the one who can govern it. Frost, snow, rain, and dew give life and take it, yet Heaven acts not—still we honor Heaven. To grasp at patterns and exhaust oneself with laws is to hold fast to toil. Those who administer offices and govern the people are the functionaries; the ruler has no business here—yet we revere the ruler.

Those who cleared the land and tilled the soil were Hou Ji; those who dredged the rivers and deepened the streams were Yu; those who heard cases and judged with equity were Gao Yao; those who bore the name of sage were Yao. Thus, one who attains the Dao to govern employs others: though personally inept, he ensures the capable serve him. Without the Dao, even many skills bring no benefit.

A square boat crosses the river; an empty boat drifts from one side and collides, overturning it. Though one may harbor resentment, no anger shows. But if a man were aboard, he would first pull in the oars, then call out to draw them back—near shore he gathers, far shore he extends. If he shouts once, twice, and receives no answer, he will surely follow with harsh words. Where before there was no anger, now there is anger; where before it was empty, now it is full.

If one can empty oneself and move through the world, who can revile him? To abandon the Dao and rely on cunning is to court danger; to discard method and employ talent is to invite distress. There are those who perish through many desires, but none who are imperiled by having none. There are those who bring chaos through seeking order, but none who lose by holding to constancy.

Thus, wisdom is not enough to avoid calamity, nor is folly enough to bring about loss and restlessness. Guard your allotted portion, follow principle—lose without sorrow, gain without joy. Thus, achievement is not what one does, and attainment is not what one seeks. In receiving, there is acceptance without taking; in giving, there is bestowal without offering. Things grow in spring, wither in autumn—what lives is not credited with virtue, what dies is not blamed with resentment. This is near to the Dao.

The sage does not act in ways that invite reproach, nor does he resent others’ reproaches of him. He cultivates virtue that brings praise, yet does not seek others’ praise. He cannot prevent misfortune from arriving, but trusts in not inviting it. He cannot ensure blessings will come, but trusts in not warding them off. Misfortune arrives not from what one seeks, so one remains untroubled in adversity. Blessings come not from what one pursues, so one remains unassuming in success.

Knowing that the control of fortune and misfortune lies not with oneself, one dwells in leisure and joy, governs through non-action. The sage guards what he possesses and does not seek what he lacks. To seek what one does not have is to lose what one does have. To cultivate what one possesses is to have one’s desires fulfilled.

Thus, in warfare, first ensure invincibility to await the enemy’s vulnerability; in governance, first ensure unassailability to await the enemy’s vulnerability. Shun cultivated the fields of Lishan, and all within the seas followed his transformation; King Wen cultivated Qizhou, and all under Heaven shifted their customs. Had Shun pursued the world’s profit and forgotten the cultivation of his own Way, he could not have preserved himself—how then could he have possessed even a foot of land?

Thus, if governance is not yet firmly established against disorder, those who act to govern will surely be imperiled. If conduct is not yet firmly established in blamelessness, those who rush to seek fame will surely be worn down. No blessing is greater than the absence of misfortune; no profit is finer than not losing what one has.

Action, as a thing, either diminishes or augments—action is having purpose. What does not succeed is destroyed; what does not profit brings harm. All is perilous—perilous means danger and difficulty, paths one cannot tread. To follow such paths is to court peril.

Thus, Qin triumphed over the Rong yet was defeated at Yao; Duke Mu of Qin conquered the Western Rong but was routed by Jin at Yao. Chu triumphed over the Central States yet was defeated at Boju; King Zhao of Chu subdued the Central States but was vanquished by Wu at Boju. Thus, the Dao cannot be urged toward profit, but it can be relied upon to peacefully avoid harm.

Therefore, one may constantly be without misfortune, but not constantly have blessings; one may constantly be without guilt, but not constantly have merit. The sage has no thoughts, no plans laid by. What comes is not welcomed; what goes is not sent off. Though men move east, west, south, or north, he stands alone at the center.

Thus, amid a multitude of crookedness, he does not lose his straightness; though all under Heaven flow away, he alone does not depart from his sacred precinct. Therefore, he does not do good, nor does he shun the shameful—he follows the Dao of Heaven.

Do not take the lead, nor monopolize the self—cultivate the principles of Heaven. Do not premeditate, nor forsake the times—keep tryst with Heaven. Do not seek gain, nor decline blessings—follow Heaven’s norms. Do not pursue what is absent, nor lose what is attained; within, there is no collateral misfortune; without, there is no collateral blessing. When misfortune and blessing do not arise, how can there be harm from others?

To do good is to be observed—what the multitude observes. To do ill is to be discussed. Observation breeds esteem; discussion breeds trouble. Thus, the arts of the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame, but may be withdrawn to cultivate the self. They cannot be used to obtain profit, but may be employed to avoid harm. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct, nor reputation through wisdom; he models himself on the natural, and has no part in it.

Thoughts cannot surpass their measure; actions cannot surpass virtue; affairs cannot surpass the Dao. Those who act may not succeed; those who seek may not obtain. Men may reach their limit, but the Dao is never obstructed—contending with the Dao brings misfortune.

Thus the *Odes* says:
*"Unknowing, unperceiving,
They follow the Emperor’s norms."*
One with wisdom yet without action shares the Dao of the unwise; one with ability yet without affairs shares the virtue of the incapable. In wisdom, one is as if without wisdom; in ability, one is as if without ability—this is the rectitude of the Dao.

Thus, though one’s merit covers all under Heaven, one does not display its beauty; though one’s beneficence extends to later generations, one does not claim its name. When the Dao prevails, human artifice vanishes. Fame and the Dao cannot both shine forth: when men receive fame, the Dao is unused; when the Dao prevails over men, fame ceases.

The Dao and men vie for ascendancy. Those who exalt men suppress the Dao. *Exalt* means to make manifest; *suppress* means to halt. When men are exalted and the Dao is suppressed, peril is not far off. Thus, when an age has a sage’s fame, the day of its decline has arrived.

Those who covet fame must do good; those who would do good must create affairs. Affairs arise, then one abandons the public and pursues the private, discards moderation and relies on the self. Desiring praise for doing good and establishing a name for integrity, one neglects the cultivation of governance and does not await the proper time. Neglecting governance brings many reproaches; acting without regard for timing yields no merit. Many reproaches and little merit—unable to meet these, one acts recklessly to seek validation, acts rashly to hit the mark.

When merit is achieved, it is not enough to repay reproaches; *repay* means to compensate. When affairs fail, it is not enough to ruin the self. Thus, to value doing good as one values doing ill is to draw near the Dao.

All under Heaven is not without trustworthy men, yet when dividing goods and wealth, they must draw lots to determine shares—*drawing lots* means to hold the tally. They believe that those with intention cannot be as impartial as those without. All under Heaven is not without incorruptible men, yet those who guard precious treasures must lock their doors and seal them completely. They believe that those with desire cannot be as incorruptible as those without.

When men point out one’s flaws, one resents them; when a mirror reveals one’s ugliness, it is a good mirror. *Mirror* means looking glass. A mirror shows a person’s beauty or ugliness—thus it is a good mirror. One who engages with things yet does not involve the self is free from entanglement—*not involving the self* is like a mirror reflecting forms without possessing likes or dislikes.

Gongsun Long traded in words to sell fame—Gongsun Long, with his arguments that a white horse is not a horse, that ice is not cold, and charcoal is not hot, thus is said to *sell*. Deng Xi was clever in debate but disrupted the law—Deng Xi taught the people of Zheng to litigate; when litigation did not end in mutual withdrawal, Zichan executed him. Su Qin was skilled in persuasion but perished—Su Qin died in Qi.

Following the Dao, goodness leaves no trace; cultivating its principles, skill leaves no name. Thus, those who contend with skill and strength begin with yang but invariably end in yin—*yang* refers to the outset of cunning’s application, which ends in yin, or evil. Those who govern the state with cleverness begin with order but invariably end in chaos.

Who cannot guide water to flow downward? But to force it upward requires skill. Thus, when ornament prevails, substance is obscured; when deceitful cunning arises, rectitude is blocked.

Virtue can be cultivated by the self but cannot be used to make others violent; the Dao can govern the self but cannot be used to make others chaotic. Though one possesses the treasure of the worthy and sage, in an age of violence and disorder, one may preserve the self, but cannot become a hegemon or king.

Tang and Wu became kings because they encountered the violence of Jie and Zhou. Jie and Zhou were not violent because of Tang and Wu’s worthiness—Tang and Wu encountered the violence of Jie and Zhou and thus became kings. Therefore, even a worthy king must await the encounter. *Encounter* means to meet the times and obtain it, not to achieve it through knowledge or ability.

The noble person cultivates conduct so that goodness leaves no name; bestows generosity so that benevolence leaves no trace. Thus, the scholar practices goodness yet does not know whence goodness arises. The people seek profit yet do not know whence profit comes—thus, without action, there is self-governance.

When goodness is manifest, scholars contend for fame; when profit has a source, the people contend for merit. When these two contentions arise, even the worthy cannot govern. Therefore, the sage conceals his traces in doing good and silences his name in practicing benevolence.

Seeking external alliances for support and serving the great for security is not as good as internal governance awaiting the proper time. In all matters of serving others, if not with treasures and gifts, then with humble words. Serving with jade and silk exhausts wealth yet leaves desires unfulfilled; using submissive posture and gentle words exhausts persuasion yet fails to forge bonds.

When covenants and sworn alliances are made, the agreements are set yet soon betrayed—*fan* means to turn against and rebel. Even if one were to cede the state’s every *zi* and *chui* in service to others—six *liang* make a *zi*, twice a *zi* makes a *chui*—without a way to rely on oneself, it is insufficient for preservation. If one truly abandons the strategy of external alliances and instead diligently attends to affairs within the borders, exhausts the land’s potential to increase stores, sharpens the people’s resolve unto death to fortify the city, unites ruler and subject in a single purpose, and guards the altars of soil and grain with unwavering resolve so the people do not flee, then those who would attack will not strike the innocent, and those who seek advantage will not assault the invincible. This is surely the way to preservation.

The people have a Dao they all follow and laws they all uphold—ordinary conduct aligns with the shared Dao, while statutes are jointly observed. Since righteousness cannot bind them together nor might guarantee their loyalty, a ruler is established to unify the people. When the ruler holds to the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Dao is not for action but for non-action. What is non-action? The wise do not use their position to meddle, the brave do not use their position to oppress, the benevolent do not use their position to indulge—this is called non-action. Through non-action, one attains the One. The One is the root of the myriad things, the way of invincibility.

By nature, people in youth are reckless, in maturity violent and overbearing, in old age covetous. A single body undergoes many changes—how much more so when rulers frequently alter laws and states frequently change rulers? People use their positions to pursue their likes and dislikes, and the paths below become impossible to govern. Thus, when a ruler loses the One, chaos exceeds even that of a rulerless time. As the *Odes* says: "Without error, without forgetfulness, follow the old statutes." This is what it means.

If a ruler favors wisdom, he will defy the times and rely on himself, discard methods and employ deliberation. The world’s affairs are vast, yet wisdom is shallow—using the shallow to fathom the vast, none have succeeded. Relying solely on one’s own wisdom, losses will be many. Thus, favoring wisdom is a path to exhaustion. Favoring bravery leads to underestimating enemies and neglecting defenses, to self-reliance and rejecting aid. Relying on one’s own strength to encircle a formidable foe, without depending on the multitude and instead using only personal ability, will surely fail. Thus, favoring bravery is a perilous path. Favoring generosity results in no fixed allotments. If the ruler’s distributions are unstable, the people’s expectations will know no end. If heavy taxes fill the treasuries, it makes enemies of the people. To take little and give much—such a thing has never existed. Thus, favoring generosity is the way to invite resentment.

Benevolence, wisdom, courage, and strength are human excellences, yet none suffice to govern the world. From this, we see that worthiness and ability are inadequate for the task, and the cultivation of the Dao and its arts becomes clear.

The sage conquers the heart. The heart is where desires arise. The sage restrains desire, thus conquering the heart and making the people’s hearts his own. The common people conquer desire—they desire it yet can restrain themselves. The noble person embodies upright *qi*, the petty person embodies perverse *qi*. That which inwardly accords with nature and outwardly aligns with righteousness, moving in accordance with principle without clashing with things, is upright *qi*. That which indulges in rich flavors, luxuriates in sounds and sights, gives free rein to joy and anger, and disregards future harm is perverse *qi*. The perverse and the upright injure one another, desire and nature harm each other—they cannot coexist. One rises as the other falls, so the sage curbs desire and attends to nature.

The eyes delight in beauty, the ears in sound, the mouth in flavor—they encounter and take pleasure in these. Unaware of the harm in indulging desires, eating brings no peace to the body, listening does not accord with the Dao, seeing does not benefit nature. The three palaces contend—the three palaces being the three gates of eating, seeing, and hearing. The heart governs with righteousness. Cutting away an abscess is not painless, drinking poison is not without bitterness, yet one does so because it benefits the body. Drinking water when thirsty is not unpleasant, feasting when hungry is not unsatisfying, yet one refrains because it harms nature. These four cases show that the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth do not know what to accept or reject—the heart governs, and each finds its proper place. From this, it is clear that desires cannot be overcome.

In all matters of cultivating the body and nurturing nature, regulating rest and activity, moderating food and drink, harmonizing joy and anger, and adapting movement and stillness, what lies within oneself is attained, and perverse *qi* does not arise. How could this compare to the anxiety of tumors and sores erupting and preparing remedies in advance? The cauldron that holds an ox boils, yet flies and gnats dare not enter. The jade *tian* of Kunlun—*tian* means a standard—cannot be sullied by dust and grime.

The sage has no mind to reject yet the heart knows no ugliness; has no mind to select beauty yet beauty is not lost. Thus, in ancestral rites, one thinks of kin without seeking blessing; in hosting guests, one cultivates reverence without expecting virtue—only those who do not seek can possess. This means that what is not sought arrives of itself.

Those in exalted positions are so called because they uphold public principle without private delight, not because they are deemed worthy. Those who possess the great earth are so called because they follow constant methods without cunning schemes, not because they are deemed wise. Within, they harbor no violent affairs to incur the resentment of the people; without, they display no worthy conduct to provoke the envy of feudal lords. The rites between superior and inferior are observed without deviation, yet in the eyes of critics, nothing is seen to admire—this is what is meant by "concealing without form." If not concealing without form, who could manifest form? Form, when spoken of, appears as divination reveals.

What the Three Dynasties followed was *yin*—accord. Thus, Yu dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, following water; Hou Ji sowed and planted grains, following earth; Tang and Wu pacified tyranny and chaos, following the times. Therefore, the world may be obtained but not seized—it cannot be forcibly taken. Hegemony and kingship may be received but not sought. If sought through cunning, others will contend; if sought through force, others will resist. There has never been one who could make others devoid of wisdom—this means one cannot ensure that the state one encounters will lack wisdom. There has only been one who could prevent others from employing their wisdom against oneself. There has never been one who could make others devoid of strength; there has only been one who could prevent others from applying their strength against oneself. These two principles endure through long observation.

Thus, when the worthy ruler is not seen, feudal lords do not prepare; when the unworthy is not seen, the people do not resent. When the people do not resent, their service may be obtained; when feudal lords do not prepare, the opportunity of the world may be seized—as when Tang and Wu rose to overthrow Jie and Zhou. Their undertakings aligned with the multitude, their achievements aligned with the times—yet the sage had no part in them. Thus, Laozi said, "The tiger has no place to set its claws; the rhinoceros has no place to set its horn." This is what he meant.

The drum is not extinguished in sound, thus it can produce sound; the mirror is not obscured by form, thus it can reflect form. Metal and stone have voices, yet without striking, they do not ring; pipes and flutes have tones, yet without blowing, they make no sound. The sage conceals within, does not take the lead in matters, responds when affairs arise, and answers when things arrive.

Adorning the exterior harms the interior; losing one’s true nature harms the spirit; displaying ornament obscures substance. One who never forgets substance for even a moment will surely strain their nature. Constantly thinking of substance without cultivating naturalness strains the nature. One who does not forget their bearing within a hundred paces will surely burden their form. Thus, those with beautiful plumage harm their bones and frame; the swan, though it soars a thousand *li* in a single flight, leaves its form like drifting dust—because its wings are too fine. Those with beautiful branches and leaves harm their roots and stems. One who can perfect both is nowhere to be found in the world.

Heaven has brightness yet does not worry that the people are benighted—the people bore windows and doors to seek light for themselves. Earth has wealth yet does not worry that the people are poor—the people fell trees and clear grass to enrich themselves. The one of utmost virtue and Dao is like a mountain, solid and unmoving, yet travelers take it as their mark. Those who walk the Way point to it as their destination.

Straightening oneself suffices for others—like a mountain, it naturally produces all things to sustain the people, not for the people’s sake that it produces them. It does not bestow, yet those who use it do not receive its virtue, thus it remains tranquil and enduring. Heaven and earth do not grant, thus they do not take away; the sun and moon do not claim virtue, thus they incur no resentment. Those who delight in gaining will surely incur much resentment; those who delight in giving will surely delight in taking. Only by erasing traces in non-action and following the naturalness of heaven and earth can one overcome principle—principle meaning the patterns of human desires. Overcoming principle means eliminating it.

To act is to invite reputation; when reputation arises, the Dao is practiced; when the Dao is practiced, people lose their place. Thus, praise gives rise to slander, goodness invites resentment. Profit is the beginning of harm; blessing is the forerunner of misfortune. Only those who do not seek profit are free from harm; only those who do not seek blessing are free from misfortune. A lord who seeks hegemony will surely lose his lordship; a hegemon who seeks kingship will surely forfeit his hegemony. Thus, the state’s constancy lies in wholeness, while hegemony and kingship are but temporary lodgings; the body’s constancy lies in life, while wealth and nobility are but temporary lodgings. One who can avoid harming their state for the sake of the world and avoid harming their body for the sake of their state—such a one may be entrusted with the world. This means one who does not covet the world’s profit may be entrusted with the world.

Those who do not understand the Dao abandon what they already possess to seek what they have not obtained. They toil their minds with anxious thoughts to follow crooked paths, thus when fortune comes, they rejoice; when misfortune comes, they fear. Their spirits labor in scheming, their wisdom is frantic in affairs; misfortune and fortune sprout, yet they never repent throughout their lives. What they themselves have generated, they instead resent in others. Misfortune and fortune both arise from oneself, not from others. Without joy, there is worry; the heart is never at peace. Holding nothing to observe is called a mad life. Having no standard to observe, what is observed is not dark virtue—thus it is called a mad life.

When a ruler favors benevolence, the undeserving are rewarded and the guilty are released. When a ruler favors punishment, the meritorious are discarded and the innocent are executed. Only one who favors neither: executing without resentment, bestowing without claiming virtue, following the level and adhering to the plumb line, remaining uninvolved in affairs—like heaven and earth, what does it not cover and bear? Thus, the one who assembles and dismisses is the ruler; the one who controls and executes is the law. When the people have received punishment, yet resentment has nowhere to vanish—this is called the Dao. When the Dao prevails, people have no affairs.

The sage wears no extraordinary attire—short or long.

Long and short refer to attire. Wearing garments that do not fit brings disaster upon oneself. Without extraordinary conduct, one’s clothing goes unnoticed—what one wears, the multitude does not observe. Conduct unobserved, words undiscussed, unobstructed yet unadorned, impoverished yet unafraid, honored yet unassuming, secluded yet unbounded, different yet unremarkable—such bearing does not conform to the crowd. Nameless, this is called the Great Unobstruction.

Rising and bowing, advancing and retiring, pacing and circling—these are done out of necessity, not innate to one’s nature. When emotions bear no seal of restraint, they are not what one delights in. Acting from necessity, bowing and yielding are done not by choice. Yet one does not shirk them—how could they be done deliberately? Deliberation arises from adapting to the times, not from contrivance.

Thus, one who sings out of necessity does not perform sorrow; one who dances out of necessity does not flaunt beauty. Those who sing and dance without performing sorrow or beauty possess no rooted intent. Without rooted intent, sorrow and beauty are forced.

A skilled gambler does not crave gain; playing the game, they do not scheme to harm. Unafraid of defeat, their mind is calm, their intent steady. Grasping the balance, they find the proper measure. Acting according to principle, though victory is not assured, they will surely gain more. Why? Success lies in method, not in desire. Desire seeks victory.

A charioteer does not covet the lead; racing steeds, they do not fear falling behind. Rein and hand move in harmony, the mind in tune with the horses. Though they may not always prevail, the horses’ strength is fully spent. Why? The lead lies in method, not in desire.

Thus, extinguishing desire allows method to prevail; abandoning cunning allows the Dao to stand. A merchant with many schemes grows poor; a craftsman with many skills falls into want—their heart is not single. A great tree harms its branches; deep water harms its depths.

With wisdom but no technique, drilling will not penetrate; though one possesses intelligence, the deeper one drills, the more impenetrable it becomes—without technique, nothing is achieved. With a hundred branches but no single path, though one gains, one cannot hold.

Thus the *Poetry* says: “The noble person, their demeanor is one—like a knot, their heart is bound.” The noble one is knotted in unity.

Shun plucked the five-stringed zither and sang the *South Wind*, using its joyful harmony to govern the world. The Duke of Zhou left the roasted meat uneaten before him, the bells and drums unsilenced upon their stands, to assist King Cheng and bring peace to the realm.

A commoner tending a hundred *mu* of land has no leisure to rise or rest, nowhere to divert their labor. Yet one who listens to the affairs of all under heaven finds the day too long and governance insufficient—this is because others act on their behalf.

One in exalted position is like the ancestral spirit: though capable of butchering dogs or roasting pigs, they do not do so—yet their inability does not diminish them. The arrangement of sacrificial vessels, the order of millet and grain, though they know it, they do not instruct—yet their ignorance does not harm.

One who cannot perform the rites of the invocator cannot serve as invocator, but this does not prevent them from serving as the ancestral spirit. One who cannot drive a chariot cannot be a driver, but this does not prevent them from being an attendant. The attendant holds the lord’s position.

Thus, the higher the rank, the more the body is at ease; the greater the stature, the fewer the affairs. Like tuning a zither: though the small strings are taut, the great strings must be slack.

Non-action is the essence of the Dao; holding to the rear is its bearing. Non-action governs action—this is technique. Holding to the rear governs the front—this is method. Following technique brings strength; scrutinizing method brings tranquility.

Now, offering a Bian-shi jade to one who has not yet received it is to act first; seeking and presenting it, though resentment arises, is not refused—this is to act last. Three people sharing a dwelling, two quarrel: each claims rightness, neither listens. Though the third is foolish, they must decide from the side—not through wisdom, but through non-contention.

Two people brawl, a weakling stands by. Aiding one brings victory; rescuing the other brings escape. Though the fighters are strong, they are restrained by the one who does not fight—not through courage, but through non-engagement.

From this we see: the rear governs the front, stillness overcomes restlessness—this is method. Doubling the Dao and abandoning method to seek fleeting encounters, altering constants and discarding the old to grasp at trifles—if one meets success, they deem themselves right; if they hit the mark, they take it as a sign. Acting in darkness, erring and changing, they pass their lives unenlightened—this is called madness.

With obstruction comes defeat; with fortune comes weakness; with error comes regret; with merit comes pride. Proceeding without turning back—this is the madman.

A circle fits the compass; a square fits the carpenter’s square. Conduct forms the beast—ancient rites held lambs and fawns, taking their kneeling to nurse, their herding without faction. Stillness forms pattern—pattern refers to dignified bearing and adornment. This can lead the few, but not the many.

Smartweed grows in rows—smartweed is small, yet all have their order. Jars and urns have their bases—the base secures what lies beneath. Measuring grain before hulling, counting rice before cooking—this can govern a household, but not a state.

Washing cups before eating, rinsing goblets before drinking, sweeping the courtyard before serving food—this can nourish a family elder, but not feast an army. Without ease, one cannot govern the great; without simplicity, one cannot unite the multitude.

Great music must be easy; great ritual must be simple. Ease allows it to be heavenly; simplicity allows it to be earthly. Great music bears no resentment; great ritual makes no demands. Within the four seas, none are not bound to its order—thus it can be imperial.

The *South Wind* is the wind of joyful harmony. The five-stringed zither was ancient; by the Zhou, it had seven strings. The Duke of Zhou left the roasted meat (the choicest cut of the shoulder) uneaten before him. The bells and drums remained suspended, unplayed, as he assisted King Cheng and pacified the realm.

A single man and woman tend a hundred *mu* of land, with no leisure to rise or rest—nowhere to divert their labor. Yet one who listens to all under heaven finds the day too long and governance insufficient—this is because others act on their behalf.

One in exalted position is like the ancestral spirit: though capable of skinning dogs or roasting pigs, they do not do so—yet their inability does not diminish them. The arrangement of sacrificial vessels, the order of millet and grain—though they know it, they do not instruct, yet their ignorance does not harm.

One who cannot perform the rites of the invocator cannot serve as invocator, but this does not prevent them from serving as the ancestral spirit. One who cannot drive a chariot cannot be a driver, but this does not prevent them from being an attendant. The attendant holds the lord’s position.

Thus, the higher the rank, the more the body is at ease; the greater the stature, the fewer the affairs. Like tuning a zither: though the small strings are taut, the great strings must be slack.

One whose heart bears sorrow finds no rest upon woven mats or soft cushions—*ren* means gentle yielding. Even wild-rice gruel and beef from stall-fed cattle taste bitter; zither, lute, and reed pipes bring no joy. Only when cares dissolve and sorrows vanish do food become sweet, sleep peaceful, dwelling secure, and wanderings delightful.

From this we see: life has its joys, death its sorrows. Yet now men strive for what their nature cannot enjoy, harming what brings it joy. Thus, though they possess all under heaven and rank as Son of Heaven, they cannot escape becoming men of sorrow.

By nature, all delight in tranquility and detest anxiety—*min* means worry fixed upon something. They delight in ease and detest toil. A heart ever free of desire may be called tranquil; a body ever free of affairs may be called at ease. Let the mind wander in tranquility, the form roam in ease, awaiting Heaven’s decree. Rejoice within, seek nothing without. Though all under heaven be vast, it cannot exchange for even a moment’s peace. Sun and moon may wane, yet they do not irrigate the will—*yu* means hidden; *gai* means to pour. The self remains concealed, no foreign desire flooding the will.

Thus, though lowly, one may be as noble; though poor, as rich. The great Dao has no form; great benevolence no favorites; great eloquence no sound; great integrity no humility; great courage no pride. Master these five, and one nears the direction of the Way—*fang* means the Dao. One nearly turns toward the Dao.

Where commands multiply, armies fall into chaos; where wine flows freely, disputes arise. Chaos leads to defeat; disputes to mutual harm. Thus, what begins in order ever surpasses what begins in disorder; what begins in joy ever surpasses what begins in sorrow. What starts simply must end in fundamental harmony.

Now, offering fine wine and choice delicacies to feast another, bowing humbly with gentle words to welcome them, one seeks to foster joy—yet they vie over filling goblets, quarreling over whether they are full or not. This instead breeds strife. Strife leads to injury, entangling the three clans in enmity, turning to what they detest. Such is the ruin wrought by wine.

The *Odes* err through perversity—the *Odes* reflect the customs of a declining age, thus they are crooked yet used to correct. When men lose their proper way, they fall into crookedness.

Music errs through satire. In the village drinking song, the *Lu Ming* was composed when the lord had wine and delicacies yet did not summon his ministers—thus their resentment and satire of their superior were wrong.

Rites err through demanding reciprocity. In rites, nothing goes forth without return; what one bestows upon another, one expects in kind.

The *zhi* note is not without the *yu* sound; the *yu* sound is not without the *zhi* note. All five notes contain sound, yet they are named by *zhi* or *yu* because of what prevails. Within the *zhi* note lies the *yu* sound, yet it is named the *zhi* note because the *yu* sound is subsumed within it.

Thus, benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and courage—though the sage possesses them all—each bears a single name. Were one lacking, it would be called by the sage’s name, speaking of the greater.

Yang qi arises in the northeast and ends in the southwest; yin qi arises in the southwest and ends in the northeast. At the beginning of yin and yang, all is balanced and alike. As days lengthen, their kind grows, each encroaching and distancing itself from the other. Yang qi, from the Great Cold, grows warmer day by day until the Great Heat, far removed from the Great Cold. Some days scorch the sand; others freeze the water. Thus, the sage is cautious in what he accumulates.

Water flows from mountains to the sea; grain grows in the fields and is stored in granaries. Seeing the beginning, one knows the end.

Mats first come from reeds and rushes; the first offering in the goblet is dark wine—*zun* is a wine vessel, and what is revered is dark water. The first offering on the sacrificial platter is raw fish. The first dish in the wooden bowl is plain broth—*dou* refers to the wooden vessel, and what it holds is the great broth, unseasoned with the five flavors. Though none of these please the ear or eye, nor suit the mouth or belly, the former kings prized them, for they honored what was offered in ancestral temples. They put first things first and last things last.

In the sage’s dealings with things, though they shift a thousand ways and turn ten thousand times, there must be that which remains unchanged yet responds to change.

Cold and warmth are opposites. In the Great Cold, the earth splits and water congeals, yet fire does not diminish its heat. In the Great Heat, stones melt and metal flows, yet fire does not increase its intensity. The changes of cold and heat bring no gain or loss to its essence, for its nature is fixed. This speaks of the human nature that cannot be altered by fire.

The sage always follows and never leads, always responds and never initiates. He does not advance to seek, nor retreat to yield. For three years, he follows the times; when the time departs, it goes before him. For three years after it departs, the time remains behind him. Neither departing nor approaching, he stands at the center of his place.

The Way of Heaven shows no favoritism; it befriends only virtue. One who possesses the Dao does not miss the time or the person—missing the time means losing the moment, not losing the moment to give to another. One who lacks the Dao loses the time and takes from others.

Standing straight and awaiting fate, the moment’s arrival cannot be met by turning back; seeking agreement by blocking and intercepting, the moment’s departure cannot be grasped by pulling. Thus, one does not say, “I have nothing to offer, so all under heaven keeps its distance,” nor “I do not desire it, so all under heaven does not come.”

The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness, so their fame did not sway their will. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty, so profit did not move their hearts. Though fame and profit filled all under heaven, they were not enough to sway their will. Thus, they could delight in both and remain tranquil and serene. Therefore, those who govern themselves may be spoken to of the Dao.

From the self upward to the distant past is immeasurably far—“from the self upward” means from one’s own birth back to the distant past. *Huang mang* refers to the age of remote antiquity, thus it is far indeed.

From death onward to the endlessness of heaven and earth is immeasurably vast—"from death onward" means from the time after one’s own death to the boundless end of heaven and earth. *Taotao* means long and unbroken. As for the span of mortal life, *za* means a full cycle. When a person has a child, from *zi* to *hai* marks one cycle. To worry over the world’s chaos is like weeping over the scarcity of river water, trying to add to it with tears. The tortoise lives three thousand years, for it expels the old and takes in the new, thus attaining such longevity. The mayfly does not last beyond three days—*fuyou* refers to its fleeting existence, living but three days before dying. To fret over the mayfly’s means of nurturing life as one would for the tortoise would surely invite ridicule. Thus, one who does not worry over the world’s chaos but delights in the governance of the self may be spoken to of the Dao.

The noble person, though he does good, cannot ensure that wealth will come; though he refrains from wrongdoing, cannot ensure that misfortune will not arrive. When fortune comes, it is not what he sought, so he does not boast of his merit. When misfortune arrives, it is not of his making, so he does not regret his conduct. Cultivating the utmost within—*ji* means the center—yet if calamity strikes from without, it is the work of heaven, not man. Thus, the heart remains ever tranquil and detached, accumulating virtue; the dog barks, yet one is not startled, trusting in one’s true nature. Therefore, those who know the Dao are not deluded, and those who understand fate are not anxious.

When the lord of ten thousand chariots dies, his bones are buried in the open wilderness, while his spirit is venerated in the *Mingtang*—the temple is called the *Mingtang*. The spirit is prized above the form. Thus, the spirit dwells in the hall while the body lies in the wild. When the spirit governs, the form follows—*shenzhi* refers to the emotions, meaning desires are not stirred, and the body complies with the heart’s harmony. When the form prevails, the spirit is exhausted—*xingsheng* means the body’s restlessness overpowers the spirit, and the spirit, depleted, departs. Though hearing and sight are employed, they must return to the spirit; though hearing and sight are used, they guard within. When the spirit is at peace, the self is whole. This is called *Taichong*—*chong* means harmony.

**Military Strategy**

War is defense—defense against the sprouts of chaos, all of which lie in strategic planning. This treatise elucidates the profound principles of employing troops.

Those who wielded arms in antiquity did not covet vast lands or plunder gold and jade—*lüe* means "to obtain." Rather, they sought to preserve what was perishing, restore what was severed, pacify the world’s turmoil, and eradicate the suffering of the people.

All creatures with blood and *qi*—those bearing fangs and horns, claws and spurs—gore with their horns, bite with their teeth, sting with their venom, and kick with their hooves. When joyful, they play together; when enraged, they harm one another. Such is the nature of Heaven.

Humans possess desires for clothing and food, yet resources cannot suffice. Thus, they gather in mixed communities. When distribution is unequal and needs go unmet, strife arises. In strife, the strong coerce the weak, and the bold invade the timid. Lacking the strength of sinew and bone or the sharpness of claws and fangs, humans flay hides to fashion armor and smelt iron to forge blades. The greedy and rapacious among them ravage the world, stirring the masses into turmoil, leaving none in peace with what they possess.

The sage arises in indignation, punishing the violent, quelling chaos, leveling peril, purging filth, transforming turbidity into clarity, and turning danger into tranquility—thus, there is no choice but to sever the line. *Zhongjue* refers to the annihilation of the Shang kings’ middle lineage.

The origins of warfare stretch far into the past. The Yellow Emperor once battled the Flame Emperor—the Flame Emperor being the final sovereign of the Divine Farmer’s line. They clashed at Banquan, where the Yellow Emperor vanquished him. Zhuanxu once contended with Gonggong. Gonggong vied with Zhuanxu for supremacy, striking Mount Buzhou. Thus, the Yellow Emperor fought on the fields of Zhuolu—the Yellow Emperor’s battle against Chi You at Zhuolu, which lies in Shanggu. Yao waged war at the banks of the Dan River, where he, as the Lord of Chu, executed the mandate to destroy the unjust at Dan River. The Dan River flows through Nanyang. Shun campaigned against the Three Miao. The Three Miao were the Sanmiao. Qi, son of Yu, attacked Youhu. Qi, son of Yu, struck Youhu at Gan. Gan lies in the Right Fengyi Commandery.

Even the Five Emperors could not lay down arms—how much less could a degenerate age? Warfare exists to suppress violence and punish disorder. The Flame Emperor brought fire disasters, so the Yellow Emperor captured him. Gonggong caused water calamities, so Zhuanxu executed him. When instruction in the Dao and guidance by virtue go unheeded, authority and might are brought to bear. If authority and might are defied, then arms and armor are employed to restrain them.

Thus, the sage’s use of arms is like combing hair or weeding seedlings: what is removed is little, while what benefits is great. To slay innocent people while sustaining an unrighteous ruler is the greatest harm. To exhaust the world’s wealth to sate one man’s desires is the deepest calamity.

Had Jie of Xia and Zhou of Yin inflicted harm upon the people but faced consequences before their reigns, they would not have resorted to the *paoluo* torture. Had Li of Jin and Kang of Song committed a single act of injustice but perished before their states fell, they would not have turned to plunder and violence. These four rulers each committed minor transgressions, yet none were *punished*—thus, they plunged the world into chaos, harmed the common folk, indulged their own wickedness, and prolonged the realm’s suffering. Such is the great discourse that rejects this course.

The purpose of establishing rulers is to suppress violence and punish disorder.

Now, riding the strength of the myriad people yet turning to cruelty and degradation—this is like adding wings to a tiger. Why should it not be eradicated?

Those who keep pond fish must remove otters and their kin; those who raise birds and beasts must drive out jackals and wolves. How much more so for governing people?

Thus, the armies of hegemons and kings are deliberated with foresight, plotted with strategy, and upheld by righteousness—not for destruction, but to preserve what would otherwise perish. When they hear of a ruler in a rival state who inflicts cruelty upon the people, they lead their troops to its borders, reproaching him for his unrighteousness and condemning his transgressions. Upon reaching its outskirts, the commander issues orders: "Do not fell trees, do not disturb tombs, do not trample the five grains, do not set fires, do not burn stored provisions, do not seize the people as captives, do not take livestock."

Then, a proclamation is issued: "This state’s ruler defies Heaven and insults the spirits, condemns the innocent in judgment, and slaughters the blameless—this is why Heaven punishes him, why the people revile him. Our army has come to abolish unrighteousness and restore virtue. Those who oppose Heaven’s Way and lead the people to ruin shall perish with their clans. Those who submit by household shall be rewarded with households; those who submit by village shall be rewarded with villages; those who submit by township shall be enfeoffed with townships; those who submit by county shall be enfeoffed with counties."

When a state is conquered, its people are spared. Its ruler is deposed, its governance reformed, its scholars honored, its worthy and good elevated, its orphans and widows relieved, its poor and destitute succored, its prisoners released, and its meritorious rewarded. The common folk open their gates in welcome, wash their rice in preparation, and fear only that the army will not come. This is how Tang and Wu attained kingship, and how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin achieved hegemony.

Thus, when a ruler is without the Way, the people’s longing for righteous troops is like the parched yearning for rain or the thirsty craving for drink. Who would dare to meet them in battle? Therefore, when righteous armies arrive, they often prevail without fighting.

In later ages, even when rulers were without the Way, they would fortify moats and ramparts, man the battlements, and stand guard. Yet their attackers did not come to suppress violence or eliminate harm, but to seize land and expand territory. Thus, battles led to heaps of corpses and rivers of blood, dragging on day after day, and the achievements

The armor remains unscathed, blades untasted by blood; court officials hold their posts unchanged, merchants keep to their stalls, and farmers stay in their fields. Summoning righteousness and demanding allegiance, great states must pay homage, and small cities must submit. Riding the people’s desires and harnessing their strength, one removes the cruel and eliminates the bandits.

Thus, those who share a common benefit will die for one another; those who share a common sentiment will unite; those who share a common desire will aid each other. Moving in accord with the Dao, the world turns toward you; acting in accordance with the people’s will, the world becomes your weapon. Hunters pursue game, chariots speed, and men rush forward, each exerting their utmost strength. Without the threat of punishment, they yet scout and block key passes—scouts observe, and barriers seal—all for a shared benefit. When crossing a river in the same boat and suddenly encountering wind and waves, men of all clans swiftly grasp oars and poles, working together like left and right hands, not out of mutual affection but from shared peril.

Therefore, when a sagely king employs troops, it is to eliminate harm for the world and share its benefits with all people. The people’s service is like a son’s to his father or a younger brother’s to his elder. Where his might falls, it is like a mountain collapsing or a dam bursting—what enemy could withstand it? Thus, those skilled in warfare employ others as if for their own sake, while the unskilled employ them as if for their own use. Employing others as if for their own sake, there is none in the world who cannot be used; employing them for one’s own use, little is gained.

Warfare has three levels of urgency. The highest: governing the state, ordering the realm, practicing benevolence and righteousness, spreading virtue and kindness, establishing just laws, blocking the paths of evil, so that ministers draw near, the people harmonize, superiors and inferiors unite as one, and ruler and ministers join forces. The feudal lords submit to his might, and the four quarters cherish his virtue. Cultivating governance in the ancestral temple, he yet strikes down enemies a thousand *li* away. With a mere gesture or signal, the world responds—this is the highest use of arms. The next: lands are vast, the people numerous, the ruler worthy, and the generals loyal; the state is rich, the troops strong, discipline reliable, and commands clear. When two armies face each other, drums and bells resound in sight, yet before blades clash, the enemy flees—this is the second use of arms. The lowest: knowing the suitability of terrain, mastering the advantages of perilous passes, understanding the shifts of extraordinary tactics, and discerning the calculations of formations and maneuvers. Binding the drumsticks and sounding the drums, blades meet, arrows fly, blood flows and entrails spill, the dead are borne away and the wounded supported. Blood streams for a thousand *li*, corpses litter the field, and only then is victory decided—this is the lowest use of arms.

Now, the world knows only how to manage the branches but not how to cultivate the root, abandoning the trunk to tend the twigs. The means by which armies aid victory are many, but the means by which they secure certain triumph are few. Armor is sturdy, weapons sharp, chariots sturdy, horses fine, supplies abundant, and soldiers numerous—this is the great resource of an army, yet victory or defeat still hangs in the balance. Mastery of the movements of stars, sun, and moon, the calculations of *xing* and *de*, and the secrets of yin and yang—these are the aids to battle, yet survival or ruin still remains uncertain. The reason a great general always prevails lies in his unfathomable wisdom and the Dao that cannot be spoken, which the multitude cannot grasp.

When selecting and appointing officials, he is cautious; when moving or halting, he is timely. Officers and soldiers are discerning, weapons and armor well-maintained. He rectifies the Five Ranks, links squads and platoons, and clarifies drum and banner signals—this is the duty of the military commandant, who steadies the troops. He knows the dangers and ease of the terrain ahead and behind, assesses the enemy’s strength or weakness, and ensures no scout is left behind—this is the duty of the military scout. Roads are swiftly prepared, baggage trains ordered, encampments leveled, and wells and stoves connected—this is the duty of the military engineer. Supplies are gathered at the rear, and when the army moves, none are left behind; no excess baggage is carried, no equipment abandoned—this is the duty of the logistics officer. These five officers serve the general like limbs serve the body. He must choose men of ability, assign them to roles they can fulfill, and ensure each can perform his task. Instructing them in governance and reinforcing commands, he makes them like tigers and leopards with claws and fangs, or birds with six wings—none fail to serve.

Yet these are merely tools to aid victory, not the means to ensure it. The outcome of war lies fundamentally in governance. When governance prevails over the people, the lower ranks submit to the upper, and the army is strong. When the people prevail over governance, the lower ranks rebel against the upper, and the army is weak. Thus, virtue and righteousness sufficient to win the hearts of the world’s people, undertakings sufficient to meet the world’s crises, appointments sufficient to gain the hearts of worthy scholars, and planning sufficient to know the balance of strength and weakness—these are the roots of certain victory.

Vast lands and numerous people do not make one strong; sturdy armor and sharp weapons do not ensure victory; high walls and deep moats do not guarantee security; harsh commands and severe punishments do not inspire awe. A state with sound governance, though small, will endure; a state with failing governance, though large, will perish.

In ancient times, the lands of Chu extended southward to encompass the Yuan and Xiang Rivers—*juan* meaning to bend and take. The Yuan and Xiang are two rivers. To the north, it encircled the Ying and Si Rivers—the Ying and Si being two rivers. To the west, it embraced Ba and Shu; to the east, it enveloped Tan and the Huai. The Ba, Shu, Tan, and Huai are place names. The Ying and Ru were its drainage ditches—*xu* meaning channels. The Yangtze and Han served as its moats, fortified by the Deng Forest—the Deng Forest being a perilous stretch along the Mian River—and walled by the Fangcheng. *Mian* means to encircle; Fangcheng was Chu’s northern barrier, located in present-day Ye of Nanyang. Its mountains rose so high they brushed the clouds; its streams plunged so deep no light reached their depths—*si* meaning to extend. Such were its strategic advantages in terrain and topography. Its soldiers and people were brave, and their armor was fashioned from the hides of crocodiles, rhinoceroses, and water buffalo. Their weapons included long-forged short spears—*cong* being a small lance. The Qi formed the vanguard, while massed crossbows covered the rear—*ji nu* meaning repeating crossbows. Chariots flanked the sides, swift as arrows—*zhui* referring to arrows with metal tips and feathered shafts. When they clashed, it was like thunder and lightning; when they dispersed, it was like wind and rain. Yet their armies met disaster at Chuisha—Chuisha being a place name—and their forces were shattered at Baiju.

Though Chu’s might was vast, its lands and people accounting for half the world, King Huai still feared the Lord of Mengchang and was coerced by Qi. He abandoned the defense of his altars of state and surrendered himself to mighty Qin. When King Huai entered Qin, he was detained at Lantian. His armies were crushed, his lands diminished, and he died in exile, never to return.

The Second Emperor—Hu Hai, the younger son of the First Emperor of Qin—held the power of the Son of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Wherever human footsteps reached or boats could sail, there were commanderies and counties. Yet he indulged his senses and exhausted extravagance, heedless of the people’s hunger, cold, and destitution. He mobilized the might of ten thousand chariots to build the Epang Palace—Epang being a place where Qin constructed its palace. He conscripted the poor from the alleys—Qin drafted the impoverished from the left lanes, though the dynasty fell before the levy was complete—and exacted taxes amounting to two-thirds of the people’s wealth. The people, summoned to endure extreme punishments, died in droves along the roads, their bodies piled like the crossbars of carts—*lu* being the horizontal bar used to pull a carriage. In a single day, the dead numbered in the thousands and tens of thousands. The world seethed as if scorched by fire, suffering as if burned by flames. Above and below could find no peace; officials and people had no one to rely on—*liao* meaning to depend.

Then the garrison soldier Chen Sheng rose in Daze Marsh—Chen Sheng, styled She, was a native of Ruyin; Daze was in Pei’s Qixian County. He bared his right arm and proclaimed the greatness of Chu, and all under heaven responded in unison. At that time, they had no sturdy armor or sharp weapons, no powerful crossbows or strong siege engines. They sharpened thorns and jujubes into spear shafts—thorns and jujubes being sour jujubes; *qin* meaning a spear handle—and carved Zhou awls into blades—*Zhou* meaning to bore. They honed their tools to a point and brandished hoes and axes, yet when they faced well-forged halberds and strong crossbows, attacked cities, and seized lands, none could withstand them. The world churned like boiling water, stirred like swarming ants, and surged forth like clouds rolling up a mat, spanning thousands of miles.

Though their status was the lowest and their weapons the crudest, when one man raised his voice, all under heaven answered—because the people’s grievances had long accumulated.

When King Wu campaigned against Zhou, he faced east to welcome the year—Taisui being in *yin*. At Fan, he encountered floods—Fan being a place name; *shui* meaning heavy rains. At Gongtou, the mountains crumbled—Gongtou being a mountain in the bend of the Yellow River; *zhui* meaning to fall. A comet appeared and handed its handle to the men of Yin—at the time, a comet appeared, its tail pointing east, as if to sweep away the westerners. During the battle, ten suns appeared in confusion above, while wind and rain lashed from within. Yet there were no rewards for those who trod into danger, nor punishments for those who fled. Before blades were fully drawn, all under heaven was won.

Thus, those skilled in defense need not resist, and those skilled in warfare need not fight. They understand the Dao of prohibitions and permissions, openings and closures, seize the momentum of the times, and harness the people’s desires to take all under heaven. Therefore, those who govern well accumulate virtue, and those who wage war well store up wrath. When virtue is accumulated, the people can be employed; when wrath is stored, awe can be established.

If the governance applied is shallow, the power it overcomes will be small. If the virtue bestowed is profound, the authority it commands will be vast. When the authority it commands is vast, one’s own strength grows while the enemy’s weakens. Thus, those skilled in warfare first weaken the enemy before engaging in battle, so their efforts are halved while their achievements are doubled.

Tang’s domain was but seventy *li* square, yet he reigned as king—because he cultivated virtue. Zhibo possessed a thousand *li* of land, yet he perished—because he exhausted military force. Therefore, a state of a thousand chariots that practices civil virtue will rule as king, while a state of ten thousand chariots that delights in war will perish.

Thus, victorious armies first secure victory and then do battle—first ensuring victory through virtue, then engaging in war, as Tang and Wu did. Defeated armies first fight and then seek victory.

When virtue is equal, the numerous prevail over the few. When strength is matched, the wise prevail over the foolish. When power is balanced, those with strategy overcome those without. In all warfare, one must first wage war in the ancestral temple. Assess which ruler is more worthy, which general more capable, which people more attached, which state better governed, which stores more abundant, which soldiers more disciplined, which armor sharper, and which equipment more suitable. Thus, one may devise strategies in the temple halls and decide victory a thousand *li* away.

What has form can be seen and contested by all under heaven; what is recorded in texts can be transmitted and studied by the people of the world. All these rely on form to prevail—yet those who excel in form do not follow such methods.

What is prized in the Dao is its formlessness. Formless, it cannot be constrained or compelled, cannot be measured or calculated, cannot be outwitted or schemed against. Where cunning is revealed, others devise strategies; where form is exposed, others achieve merit; where the multitude is seen, others submit; where weapons appear, others prepare. All movements—circling and returning, crouching and stretching—where craft and deceit may be applied, are not the methods of the truly adept.

The movements of the adept are spirit emerging and ghosts in motion, stars gleaming and the obscure in pursuit. Advancing and retreating, bending and extending, no trace of order is visible. Like the phoenix soaring and the qilin stirring, the phoenix in flight and the dragon ascending—launched like the autumn wind, swift as a startled dragon. The dragon is a fish, yet the swiftest in flight. Strike the living against the dead, the flourishing against the decaying, the swift against the slow, the sated against the hungry. Like water extinguishing fire, like boiling water melting snow—where can one go and not succeed? Where can one proceed and not prevail?

Within, the spirit is empty; without, the will is serene. Moving through the formless, striking from the unforeseen. Drifting like the fleeting breeze, vanishing like the sudden gust—none know where it goes. Emerging through the branches, entering through the gaps—none know where it gathers. Sudden as thunder, swift as wind and rain, as if rising from the earth, as if descending from the heavens. Alone it comes, alone it goes—none can resist. Swift as a loosed arrow, how can one counter it? Now hidden, now revealed—who knows its beginning or end? Before its emergence is seen, it has already arrived.

Thus, the master of warfare perceives the enemy’s vulnerability and seizes it without hesitation, pursues without relenting, presses without withdrawing. Strike when they waver, overwhelm when they falter—swift as thunder, leaving no time to cover the ears; swift as lightning, leaving no time to shield the eyes.

The master of warfare moves like echo answering sound, like drumbeat meeting drumskin’s resonance. Blinking cannot keep pace with the hand’s motion, nor breath with the battle cry. In such a moment, one looks up and does not see the heavens, looks down and does not see the earth; the hand does not wave the halberd, yet the blades are not fully drawn. The assault is like thunder, the onslaught like wind, the scorching like fire, the surge like waves. The enemy, whether still or in motion, knows neither what to defend nor what to do.

Thus, when drums roar and banners wave, all who stand before them falter, collapse, and crumble—who in the world would dare to resist their might with defiant resolve? Therefore, he who strikes first prevails; he who waits is defeated; he who lets others dictate his moves perishes.

When troops are composed, their defense is firm; when their focus is unified, their might is formidable; when their resolve is decisive, their courage is boundless; when their hearts waver, they flee; when their strength is divided, they weaken. Thus, if one can divide the enemy’s forces and sow doubt in their hearts, even the slightest advantage suffices; if one cannot divide their forces or unsettle their hearts, even a tenfold advantage proves insufficient.

King Zhou’s armies numbered in the millions, yet their hearts were scattered; King Wu’s troops, though but three thousand, were single-minded and united. Thus, a thousand men with one heart wield the strength of a thousand; ten thousand with divided hearts are as naught. When generals, officers, and common soldiers move as one body, only then can they meet the enemy in battle.

Therefore, plans must be set before action, decisions made before movement. The general must harbor no doubt, the troops no divided loyalty; their movements must be unwavering, their words unfeigned, their actions untested. They must respond to the enemy with swiftness and strike with urgency.

Thus, the general is the body to the people, and the people are the heart to the general. When the heart is true, the limbs will brave the blade; when the heart wavers, the limbs falter and flee. If the heart is not single-minded, the body cannot act in unison; if the general’s resolve is not steadfast, the troops will not fight with courage. Therefore, the finest general’s soldiers are like the tiger’s fangs, the rhinoceros’s horn, the bird’s pinions, the centipede’s legs—sharp as the horsefly’s sting. They can march, they can charge, they can bite, they can gore; though strong, they do not harm one another; though numerous, they do not turn on each other, for they are moved by a single heart.

Thus, when the people truly follow their commander’s orders, even the few need not fear; when they do not, even the many are as few. If the ranks do not trust their leaders, their hearts will not serve; if the troops do not fear their general, their discipline will not hold. Defense will be unshakable, and attack will be unstoppable—not even waiting for blades to clash before the outcome is already decided.

Warfare possesses three strategic advantages and two tactical powers: there is the momentum of *qi*, the advantage of terrain, and the leverage of circumstance.

When the general is bold and scorns the enemy, when the troops are resolute and eager for battle, when the three armies—numbering a million strong—aspire to the heavens and their *qi* surges like the whirlwind, their voices like thunder, their sincerity overwhelming and their might crushing the foe—this is called the momentum of *qi*.

Narrow passes, strategic fords, towering mountains, and winding defiles—where dragons coil and serpents twist, where paths reverse like an overturned bamboo hat, where the way twists like a sheep’s intestines, where the "bamboo-shoot gate" traps like a fish weir, allowing entry but no escape—here, a single man guarding the pass can bar the way to a thousand. This is called the advantage of terrain.

Exploiting the enemy’s exhaustion, weariness, disorder, hunger, thirst, cold, or heat; pushing when they teeter, shoving when they totter—this is called the leverage of circumstance.

The master of espionage employs double agents, scrutinizes plans, sets ambushes in thickets, conceals his form, and strikes from the unforeseen. The enemy’s forces, caught unprepared, know not where to turn—this is called knowing the tactical power of deception.

When formations are ordered, vanguards selected, advances and retreats synchronized, squads coordinated, front and rear unentangled, left and right undisturbed—few are those who take the blade, many those who wound the enemy. This is called the tactical power of execution.

When strategic advantages take shape, when officers and troops are single-minded and precise, when the capable are chosen and posts filled by the right men, when plans are set and decisions made, when life and death are clear, when actions are sound and errors avoided—none can withstand the shock. Thus, cities fall without siege engines or scaling ladders; battles are won without blades crossing; the certainty of victory is manifest.

Therefore, one does not engage in battle without assurance of victory, nor launch an attack without certainty of success. Victory must be assured before battle is joined, the signal given before movement begins. Thus, forces gather without vain dispersal, troops advance without empty return.

Only when there is no reckless movement—no "almost" or "nearly"—does one shake heaven and earth, defy the mountains, sweep the seas, make ghosts and spirits flee, and beasts take flight. Then, the wilds know no rival armies, the enemy’s forces dare not meet in battle again, and the nation’s cities stand undefended.

Calm overcomes agitation, order masters chaos; the formless controls the formed, non-action responds to change. Though one may not yet have triumphed over the enemy, the enemy has no path to victory. If the enemy moves first, their form is revealed; if they are restless while we are still, their strength is spent. When form is revealed, victory can be seized; when strength is spent, might can be established.

Observe their actions and adapt accordingly; discern their righteousness or deceit to command their fate. Bait them with what they desire, exhaust their steps.

Should the enemy exploit a gap, swiftly seal their breach, exhaust their permutations to bind them, and deplete their momentum to humble them. If the enemy reverts to stillness, launch the unexpected; when they fail to respond, exhaust their maneuvers alone—meaning, I exhaust my own maneuvers to await the enemy.

If they move and I counter, their actions are exposed; if they lag in rhythm, they become the enemy. "Lag" means falling behind the rhythm. The enemy behind compels the one ahead to act first. Adapt with their shifts. Where they amass, they must also falter: if their essence turns left, ensnare their right flank—the right flank being the west. Should the enemy rout and flee, their rear can yet be turned.

If pressed and unmoving, they are called "stagnant delay"; strike them like thunder, sever them like grass and trees, dazzle them like fire and lightning. Seek swiftness to overtake; men cannot match the pace of spurs, chariots cannot turn their hubs in time. Troops stand like rooted trees, crossbows coil like ram’s horns. Though their numbers be great, none dare resist the momentum.

All that bears form can be countered; all that takes shape can be met.

Thus the sage conceals form in the formless and roams the mind in emptiness. Wind and rain may be blocked, but cold and heat cannot be opened or closed—because they are without form. That which can slip through the subtlest crevices, pierce metal and stone, reach the farthest extremes, soar beyond the nine heavens (放 means "to lodge"), coil beneath the Yellow Springs—only the formless can do this.

The skilled commander strikes disorder, not order; he does not assault a fully arrayed foe or charge against firmly planted banners (填填: banners standing firm and upright). Before the enemy’s intent is visible, engage through numerical advantage. When they reveal a fatal flaw, seize and control it. If the enemy clings to rigid patterns, their movements will fall into shadow. Respond to the substantial with the insubstantial, and they will surely be captured.

Tigers and leopards do not stir and thus avoid pitfalls; deer do not move and thus escape snares; birds do not take flight and thus evade nets; fish and turtles do not shift and thus avoid hooks. No creature is not controlled by its own movement. Therefore the sage values stillness. Stillness can respond to agitation, lateness can respond to earliness, precision can overcome carelessness, breadth can capture gaps.

Thus the masterful general commands his troops by unifying their hearts and consolidating their strength. The brave cannot advance alone, the timid cannot retreat alone. They halt like mountains, advance like wind and rain. What they assail is broken, none can withstand their destruction. They move as one body, none can resist. Thus many wound the enemy, while few engage in hand-to-hand combat.

Five fingers taking turns striking are not as effective as a clenched fist; ten thousand men advancing in rotation are not as effective as a hundred striking together. Tigers and leopards are swift, bears and brown bears are strong, yet men eat their flesh and sit upon their hides—because they cannot unify their knowledge or concentrate their strength.

Water overpowers fire: when the Terrace of Zhanghua (a lofty tower of Chu) burned, attempting to douse it with a ladle’s worth of water—even if one drained wells and emptied ponds—would be futile. But raise a jug, a vat, a basin, a pot to pour, and the flames can be extinguished in an instant.

Men do not possess the overwhelming advantage of water over fire, yet to seek victory with the few against the many is clearly impossible. Some strategists claim that the few can overcome the many—this refers to leadership, not combat. To lead many but employ few is due to uneven momentum; uneven momentum arises from disunited strength. To lead few but employ many is due to harmonized effort.

As for fully utilizing each man’s talent and exhausting their strength to achieve victory with the few over the many—from ancient times to the present, this has never been heard of.

Nothing is more noble than Heaven, nothing more advantageous than Earth, nothing more urgent than timing, nothing more beneficial than men. These four are the pillars of warfare. Yet they must await the Dao before they can be employed—only then can they be used as one.

Terrain can overcome Heaven’s timing, skillful action can overcome terrain, momentum can overcome men. Thus those who rely on Heaven may be deceived, those who rely on Earth may be constrained, those who rely on timing may be pressured, those who rely on men may be confused.

Benevolence, courage, trustworthiness, and integrity are human virtues, yet the courageous can be lured, the benevolent can be robbed, the trustworthy can be deceived, the upright can be outmaneuvered. A commander who reveals even a single flaw will be captured.

From this it is clear: victory in war is achieved through principle, not the excellence of human talent.

Thus those who behave like deer may be trapped with snares—deer have weapons but cannot fight, for they lack strategy. Those who behave like fish and turtles may be caught with nets—their forces scatter and do not unite. Those who behave like swans and cranes may be struck with arrows—their forces are aloft but lack cover. Only the formless cannot be countered.

Therefore the sage hides in the formless origin, so his intentions cannot be observed; moves in the shapeless, so his formations cannot be mapped. Without fixed methods or patterns, he responds appropriately to what comes. Without name or form, he transforms and takes shape.

Profound and luminous, distant and boundless, enduring through winter and summer, spring and autumn, ascending to the highest reaches, descending to the deepest depths—his changes and transformations flow without obstruction. He establishes his heart in the realm of the obscure and conceals his will in the abyss of ninefold whirls (九旋: the deepest abyss, with nine turns). Even with keen eyes, who can fathom his intentions?

What warfare conceals is the Way of Heaven; what it diagrams is terrain; what it articulates is human affairs; what it employs to decide victory is strategic momentum.

Thus the supreme general in command of troops secures the Way of Heaven above, the advantages of Earth below, and the hearts of men in between. He acts with opportunity and strikes with momentum—thus he suffers no shattered armies or defeated troops.

The middling general, ignorant of Heaven’s Way above and Earth’s advantages below, relies solely on men and momentum. Though he may not achieve absolute perfection, his victories will surely be many.

The inferior general, with broad learning yet self-confusion, with much knowledge yet self-doubt, is fearful when stationary and hesitant when acting—thus his movements lead to capture.

Now, when two men cross blades, their skill being equal, why does the brave and resolute always prevail? Because his actions are wholehearted.

A massive axe striking paulownia wood need not wait for an auspicious day to split it. But place the axe upon the wood without a man to wield it—even if aligned with the Dipper’s handle and embracing the powers of punishment and virtue (招摇: the Dipper’s handle; 刑: the twelve celestial stems), it will achieve nothing.

Virtue (德) refers to the ten celestial stems. Yet without the power of momentum (勢), even it cannot split the wood. Thus, water surges with force when channeled, and arrows fly farther when loosed with vigor.

The arrowhead is bound with silver and tin—adorned, not bare. Though wrapped in fine silk or tipped with rotting lotus stems, it cannot strike alone. Only when lent the strength of sinew and horn, the momentum of bow and crossbow, does it pierce rhinoceros hide and cleave through leather shields.

The wind’s fury can tear roofs and snap trees; when it rises from the void, its descent is swift, yet ascending a high mound, it slows—such is the nature of all things set in motion.

Therefore, a master of warfare wields momentum like bursting a dam of accumulated water from a thousand-yard cliff, or rolling boulders down a ten-thousand-foot ravine. When the world sees my troops must be deployed, who dares oppose me?

A hundred men resolved to die are worth more than ten thousand certain to flee—how much more so an entire army charging through fire and water without turning back? Even if blades suddenly clash across the land, who would dare stand above them?

What is called "heaven’s decree" aligns thus: the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird ahead, the Dark Warrior behind. The Horn and Neck stars form the Azure Dragon; Orion’s Belt and the Well, the White Tiger; the Star and Spread, the Vermilion Bird; the Dipper and Ox, the Dark Warrior. In warfare, position the Well and Orion’s Belt to your right, the Horn and Neck to your left, turn your back to the Dipper and Ox, and face the Star and Spread—this follows the Dipper’s balance.

What is called "earth’s advantage" means life lies behind and death ahead, the male to the left and the female to the right. Heights are life; lowlands, death. Hills are male; valleys, female.

What is called "human affairs" demands rewards and punishments be certain, movements timely, and actions swift. These are the transmitted standards of conduct, yet they are not the source of life. Standards adapt to the times—they are not fixed.

Thus, one who sits in the shade of a hall knows the sun and moon’s order; seeing ice in a jar, one knows the world’s cold and heat. The signs by which things take form are subtle—only the sage grasps their essence.

The drum does not join the five notes yet governs them; water does not blend with the five flavors yet harmonizes them; the general does not partake in the five offices’ duties yet oversees them. Therefore, one who harmonizes the five notes does not belong to them; one who balances the five flavors does not mix with them; one who governs the five offices cannot be measured.

Thus, the general’s heart is ordered like spring, vast like summer, clear like autumn, steadfast like winter—constant and upright as winter’s rigor. Adapting to circumstances, he transforms with them; following the times, he shifts with them.

Shadows do not straighten crooked objects; echoes do not muddy clear sounds. Observe what comes, and respond with what prevails.

Therefore, act with righteousness, proceed by reason, cover your plans to strike decisively. Leverage resources to succeed, letting the enemy know your advances but not your retreats, your attacks but not your gatherings.

Begin like a fox—luring them to underestimate; close like a rhinoceros or tiger—driving them to flee. When birds of prey strike, they lower their heads; when fierce beasts seize, they hide their claws. Tigers and leopards do not bare their claws before biting, nor show their teeth before tearing.

Thus, the way of warfare is to display softness while meeting with hardness, show weakness while overpowering with strength, feign retreat while advancing, intend west while signaling east. Strike first in nature, then unite; act in darkness, then reveal. Like ghosts leaving no trace, like water leaving no wound.

Where you face is not where you go; what you reveal is not what you plot. In every movement, stillness, none can discern your design—like thunder’s strike, unpreparable. What is used is not reused, so victory is complete.

In communion with the profound and luminous, none know its gate—this is called supreme divinity.

An army’s strength lies in its people; the people’s resolve to die lies in righteousness; righteousness’s power to prevail lies in authority. Thus, unite them with culture, align them with discipline—this ensures victory. Authority and decorum together make supreme strength.

People cherish life and fear death, yet when high walls and deep moats bristle with arrows like rain, when on open plains and vast marshes blades cross, soldiers still rush to engage—not because they scorn death or welcome injury, but because rewards are certain and punishments clear.

Thus, if a ruler treats his people like children, they will regard him as a father; if he treats them like younger brothers, they will regard him as an elder brother. Treat them as children, and you will rule the four seas; regard him as a father, and the world will be ordered. Treat them as younger brothers, and they will not hesitate to die for you; serve him as an elder brother, and they will not hesitate to perish for him.

Thus, even enemies bound by father-son or brotherly ties cannot be fought—such is the power of accumulated kindness.

If four horses are unruly, even Zaofu cannot drive them far; if bow and arrow are misaligned, even Yi cannot strike true; if ruler and minister are at odds, even Sunzi cannot respond to the enemy.

*(Sunzi was Wu King Helü’s general, named Wu.)*

Thus, the ruler must cultivate governance within to accumulate virtue, and block external disgrace to establish awe. He must observe their toil and ease to know their hunger and satiety—then the day of battle will have its appointed time, and facing death will be like returning home.

Therefore, the general must share sweetness and bitterness, hunger and cold with his soldiers, so that their lives may be fully given in death. Thus, the skilled generals of old always led by example: in heat, they did not raise canopies; in cold, they did not wear furs, thereby measuring endurance through heat and cold. On perilous paths, they did not ride; when ascending heights, they dismounted, thereby equalizing toil and ease. They ate only after the army’s food was cooked, drank only after the army’s wells were dug, thereby sharing hunger and thirst. In battle, they stood within arrow’s range to share danger and safety.

Thus, a good general in warfare always strikes accumulated resentment with accumulated virtue, and accumulated hatred with accumulated love—how could he not prevail? What the ruler demands of the people are two things: that they toil for him, and that they die for him. What the people expect of the ruler are three things: that the hungry be fed, the weary be rested, and the meritorious be rewarded. If the people fulfill their two duties while the ruler fails their three expectations, then though the state be vast and its people numerous, its armies will still be weak.

But if the suffering are assured of joy, the toiling of gain, the beheaded of full reward, and the families of the fallen of recompense—for those who die in battle—then once these four promises are trusted by the people, the ruler may shoot birds in the clouds or angle fish in the abyss, play the zither and lute, strike bells and pipes, engage in six-board games, or toss arrows into high vases, yet his armies will remain strong and his commands will still be obeyed.

Thus, when the ruler’s provisions are sufficient, the people can be employed; when his virtue is sufficient to inspire admiration, his awe can be established. A general must possess three paths, four principles, five virtues, and ten steadfast qualities.

The three paths are: above, knowing the Way of Heaven; below, being versed in terrain; and in between, discerning human nature. These are the paths all people follow.

The four principles are: benefiting the state without betraying the army (betrayal here means failure to meet expectations), serving the ruler without regard for one’s life, facing peril without fearing death, and resolving doubts without shirking blame.

The five virtues are: being yielding yet uncoilable, firm yet unbreakable, benevolent yet unassailable, trustworthy yet undeceived, and courageous yet undominated.

The ten steadfast qualities are: spirit clear and unclouded, plans far-reaching and unenvious, resolve firm and unshaken, wisdom bright and unobscured, not covetous of wealth, not indulgent in things, not boastful in speech, not rigid in methods, not swayed by joy, and not provoked by anger.

This is called attaining the profound and obscure—who can fathom its depths? Every action must hit its mark, every word must align with principle, every movement must accord with the times, and every resolution must strike the proper balance.

To strike the proper balance is to align with principle. Mastering the interplay of movement and stillness, discerning the rhythms of opening and closing, and weighing the advantages and harms of every action—all must fit like tallying tokens.

Swift as a drawn crossbow, forceful as a loosed arrow, now like a dragon, now like a serpent, their movements never fixed in form. None see where they strike, none know where they end. When they attack, none can defend; when they defend, none can attack.

It is said that those skilled in warfare must first cultivate themselves before seeking from others; first ensure invincibility before pursuing victory. Cultivating oneself among others, seeking victory over the enemy—if one cannot govern oneself yet attacks another’s chaos, this is like quenching fire with fire or countering water with water. How can one prevail?

If a potter were transformed into clay, they could not shape vessels; if the clay were further reduced to raw earth, the potter could not restore it. If a weaver were turned into silk, they could not weave brocade. Sameness cannot govern sameness; thus, difference becomes the marvel.

Two sparrows fighting will not die, but when a goshawk arrives, they scatter—because it is of a different kind. Stillness is the marvel of restlessness, order the marvel of chaos, satiety the marvel of hunger, ease the marvel of toil. The interplay of marvel and norm is like water, fire, metal, and wood alternating as yin and yang.

Those skilled in warfare wield the five slayings in response—the five slayings being the five phases. Thus, they secure total victory. The inept dwell in the five deaths out of greed, so their movements lead only to capture.

War values plans that cannot be fathomed, forms that remain concealed, and strikes that come without warning, leaving no time for preparation. If plans are exposed, they fail; if forms are revealed, they are controlled. Thus, those skilled in warfare conceal themselves in heaven above, earth below, and among people.

Concealing in heaven means nothing cannot be controlled. What is concealing in heaven? Extreme cold or heat, fierce winds or violent rain, thick fog or dark obscurity—using these to create change.

What is concealing in earth? Mountains, hills, mounds, forests, thickets, and perilous terrain—places where one can lie in ambush unseen.

What is concealing among people? Obscuring ahead while observing behind, moving through formations with sudden strikes, swift as thunder or storm. Rolling up banners, silencing drums, appearing and vanishing without form, leaving no trace of their beginnings or ends.

Thus, ranks align evenly front and back, the four sides straight as a plumb line. Advancing and retreating, they do not overstep or encroach, their flanks light and sharp. Sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, scattering and regrouping without breaking formation—this is skill in ordering ranks.

Mastery of marvel and norm, yin and yang, punishment and virtue, the five phases, observing qi, divining by stars, tortoise shells, and milfoil stalks, and interpreting omens—this is skill in the Way of Heaven.

Setting traps, laying ambushes, employing water and fire, deploying rare marvels, and raising war cries to deafen the enemy’s ears. Dragging brushwood, scattering kindling, raising dust and stirring up earth to blind their eyes—this is skill in deception.

Heavy axes and halberds, steadfast and unshakable, rooted deep and hard to terrify—neither profit nor advantage can lure them, nor can the threat of death move them: this is skill in fullness and strength. Swift and fierce, agile and bold, they charge with reckless courage, vanishing like a snuffed flame: this is skill in employing light forces for surprise attacks.

Assessing terrain, choosing encampments, fortifying ramparts, surveying signals and outposts, occupying high ground, and selecting routes—this is skill in mastering topography. Exploiting the enemy’s hunger and thirst, cold and heat, exhaustion and disorder, fear and constriction, striking with elite troops by night—this is skill in seizing the moment and adapting to change.

On level ground, use chariots; on rough terrain, use cavalry. When crossing water, rely on bows, for in water the crossbow cannot be drawn. In narrow passes, use crossbows, for handheld crossbows serve best in confined spaces. By day, display many banners; by night, raise many torches. In darkness and gloom, sound many drums: this is skill in deploying forces.

Though these eight arts are indispensable, they are not the essence of warfare. The commander must possess unique vision and unique knowledge. Unique vision means seeing what others cannot see; unique knowledge means knowing what others do not know. Seeing what others cannot see is called clarity; knowing what others do not know is called spirit. Spirit and clarity ensure victory before battle. Such victory means an enemy’s defenses cannot be breached, their forces cannot be overcome, their attacks cannot prevail—for this is the mastery of emptiness and fullness.

When superiors and subordinates are divided, commanders and officers at odds, their cause unjust, and troops harboring resentment, this is called emptiness. When the ruler is enlightened and the commander capable, superiors and subordinates united in purpose, their qi and resolve rising as one, this is called fullness. Like water poured onto fire, where it strikes, what it overwhelms shifts—unyielding and yielding do not mix, yet victory lies in their interplay: this is the meaning of emptiness and fullness.

Thus, the skilled warrior does not depend on numbers, the skilled defender does not rely on fortifications. Victory lies in gaining awe, defeat in losing morale. When full, they fight; when empty, they flee. When flourishing, they are strong; when weakened, they retreat.

King Fuchai of Wu ruled over two thousand *li* of land, fielded seven hundred thousand armored troops, defeated Yue in the south at Mount Kuaiji, crushed Qi in the north at Ailing, and overawed the Duke of Jin in the west at Huangchi—subduing Jin. This was the power of a people’s full qi.

After this, King Fuchai grew arrogant and indulgent, rejecting remonstrance and delighting in flattery. His reckless ferocity exceeded all bounds—*hao* (憢) meaning fierce and impetuous—so that none could correct him. His great ministers seethed with resentment, and the common people turned away. The King of Yue selected three thousand crack troops and captured him at Zuì, exploiting his emptiness.

The presence of emptiness and fullness in qi is like the certainty of darkness following light. Thus, victorious armies are not always full, nor are defeated armies always empty. The skilled commander fills his people’s qi to await the enemy’s emptiness; the unskilled empties his people’s qi to await the enemy’s fullness. Therefore, the interplay of emptiness and fullness in qi is the most precious principle in warfare.

Whenever a state faced peril, the ruler would summon his general from the palace and address him, saying: “The fate of the altars of soil and grain rests with you. Now the state is in danger; I ask you to lead our forces in response.” The general, having received his charge, would order the invocators, historians, and grand diviners to fast for three days. They would then proceed to the ancestral temple, bore the sacred tortoise, and divine an auspicious day to receive the drums and banners.

The ruler would enter the temple gate and stand facing west, while the general, entering the gate, would hasten to the hall and stand facing north. The sovereign would personally take up the battle-axe, grasp its head, and present its haft to the general, saying: “From this point upward to Heaven, you shall command.” He would then take up the halberd, grasp its head, and present its haft to the general, saying: “From this point downward to the abyss, you shall command.”

Having received the axes, the general would reply: “A state cannot be governed from without, nor can an army be directed from within. A divided heart cannot serve a lord, nor can a distracted will face the enemy. Since I have already received your charge, the authority of the drums, banners, axes, and halberds rests with me. I ask that you grant me your command in a single word, without further appeal. If you do not consent, I dare not take command. If you consent, I shall take my leave and depart.”

He would then pare his nails—*jian zhao* (爪鬋), a funerary rite, removing the nails from hands and feet—and don the mourning garments, called *ming yi* (明衣), for though they are worn in darkness, they are called “bright.” He would then break through the ominous gate and depart—the ominous gate being the northern gate. The general’s departure was treated as a funeral rite, for he was bound to die.

Mounting his war chariot, bearing the banners, axes, and halberds, he would appear as one barely able to sustain their weight. When facing the enemy in decisive battle, he would disregard certain death, harboring no divided loyalty. Thus, he would have no Heaven above, no Earth below, no enemy before him, and no sovereign behind him. He would advance without seeking fame and retreat without avoiding blame, protecting only the people and aligning his actions with the ruler’s interests. This is the fullness of the state and the Way of the supreme general.

In this manner, the wise would devise strategies for him, the brave would fight for him, and their qi would soar like clouds, swift as a galloping steed. Thus, before the armies even engaged, the enemy would tremble in fear. If victorious and the enemy routed, he would fully accept rewards and honors: officers would be promoted, ranks and emoluments increased, lands apportioned as tribute, and decisions made beyond the borders. Judgment and execution of offenders would be carried out within the army.

Upon returning to the state, he would lower the banners and enter with the axes and halberds, reporting to the ruler: “The army requires no further governance.” He would then don plain white garments and withdraw to a secluded chamber to await punishment. The ruler would say: “I pardon you.” The general would withdraw and don ritual attire.

For a great victory, he would remain away from his residence for three years; for a moderate victory, two years; and for a minor victory, one year. Wherever the army was deployed, it was against a state without the Dao. Thus, one could achieve victory without reprisal, seize territory without returning it, the people would suffer no epidemics, the general would not die prematurely, the five grains would flourish, wind and rain would come in season, triumph abroad would bring blessings at home, and only when fame was secured would no further harm remain.

The "Explanation of Mountains" Discourse

Mountains form the root of the Dao, the abode of the benevolent. The essence of discoursing on the Dao accumulates like mountains—hence the title "Explanation of Mountains," from which this chapter takes its name.

Po asked Hun: “What constitutes the form of the Dao?”
Po is the yin spirit of man; Hun, the yang spirit. Yin’s Dao originates from yang, thus Po asks Hun: what form does the Dao possess?
Hun replied: “It takes non-being as its form.”
The Dao is formless, taking non-being as its form.
Po said: “Does non-being possess form?”
Hun said: “It does not.”
“Then how can it be perceived?”
If it has no form or shape, how can it be known?
Hun said: “I simply encountered it.”
“Encounter” means to come upon and know it.
“To see it, it has no form; to hear it, it makes no sound—this is called the obscure and dark.”
The obscure and dark serve as metaphors for the Dao, yet they are not the Dao itself. They resemble the Dao but are not the Dao.
Po said: “I have grasped it.”
“Grasped” means to know. He then turned inward to reflect.
Hun said: “Those who attain the Dao cannot be seen in form, nor can their names be proclaimed.”
“Proclaimed” means to be named; some texts render it as “manifest.”
“Now that you possess form and name, how can the Dao reside within you?”
Po said: “Then what is speech for?”
Po asked Hun: “You have no form, so why do you speak?”
“I shall return to my origin.”
“Origin” means the root. Po spoke of returning to non-being.
Po turned to look, and Hun suddenly vanished—Hun was no longer visible. Turning back to himself, he too dissolved into formlessness.
Some texts render “form” as “being.”

If one does not engage in minor learning, one will not fall into great delusion. If one’s learning is not broad, one cannot penetrate the Dao—hence great delusion.
If one does not possess petty cleverness, one will not fall into great folly. Petty cleverness cannot comprehend things—hence great folly.
No one gazes into turbulent rainwater but gazes into still water, for it is tranquil and undisturbed.
“Turbulent rainwater” refers to water covering a jar after rain. “Still” means unmoving water. “Disturbed” means in motion. Some texts render “turbulent rainwater” as “flowing runoff.”
In Zhan He’s fishing, even a thousand-year-old carp could not escape. Zhan He was Zhan What, an ancient adept of the Dao skilled in fishing, possessing refined techniques—thus he caught a thousand-year-old carp.
When Master Zeng clung to the funeral carriage, those pulling the bier halted for him. Master Zeng’s filial piety was such that, grieving at his parent’s funeral, he clung to the funeral carriage, and those pulling it were moved to stop.
“Bier” refers to the wheels beneath the coffin. “Bier” is pronounced like the *chūn* in “oxen moving *chūnchūn*.”
When the old mother sang as she walked, Shen Xi was moved—such was the power of her essence. Shen Xi was a man of Chu who lost his mother in youth. Hearing a beggar’s song as she walked, he was moved to go out and look, only to find it was his mother. Thus it is said: the power of her essence.
When Hu Ba played the zither, the wanton fish emerged to listen. Hu Ba was a man of Chu skilled in playing the zither. The wanton fish, fond of music, lifted their heads from the water to listen.
The wanton fish has a long head, its body half its length, over a *zhang* in size, with a pure white snout, jet-black body, and mouth beneath its chin. It resembles the *lige* fish but lacks scales, dwelling in the Yangtze.
When Bo Ya played the qin, the four horses raised their heads and ceased chewing. “Raised their heads and ceased chewing” means the horses lifted their heads and seemed to smile.
When Jie Zitui sang of dragons and serpents, Wenjun shed tears. Jie Zitui was Jie Pushi.

When Duke Wen of Jin, Chong'er, fled to Di, he encountered hardship and ran out of provisions. Jie Zitui cut flesh from his own thigh to feed him. Later, when the prince restored his state, he rewarded those who had followed him in exile, yet Zitui alone was overlooked. Thus he sang:

*A dragon soars high, yet loses its place.
A serpent follows, devouring its trace.
The dragon ascends to the clouds above,
While the serpent remains in the mud below.*

The dragon alludes to Duke Wen, the serpent to himself. Thereupon, Duke Wen awakened to his error and sought Jie Zitui, but failing to find him, wept in lament.

Thus, jade lies in the mountains, and the grasses and trees are moistened—jade being the yin within yang, it nourishes the grasses and trees. A pearl forms in the abyss, and the banks do not wither—the pearl being the yang within yin, its radiance keeps the banks from drying.

The earthworm, though lacking strong sinews and bones, sharp claws and teeth—known also as the *quanyu*—feeds above on sun-dried dust and drinks below from the Yellow Springs, all through the singleness of its intent. *Xi* means dry, *ke* refers to dust, which the people of Chu call *ke*. *One* signifies focused devotion.

Clarity brings illumination, as a cup of water reveals a mustard seed; turbidity brings obscurity, as the waters of the Yellow River cannot reveal Mount Tai. Gazing at the sun dazzles the eyes; listening to thunder deafens the ears. Man is at peace when he does nothing, but harmed when he acts. The Dao prizes non-action, hence peace. Action injures the Dao, for it does not value doing. Thus, those who govern through action are harmed as if by illness. Those who govern through non-action carry nothing—meaning that those who achieve governance through non-action constantly practice its absence.

Doing means being unable to be without action. *Doing* refers to action, to likes and dislikes, emotions and desires—being unable to remain tranquil and still, hence unable to practice non-action. Those who cannot practice non-action cannot achieve action. Those who cannot practice pure stillness and non-action cannot accomplish great deeds, bring about governance, or establish merit. Thus it is said: they cannot achieve action.

Man is spirit without speech. *Without speech* means the Dao does not speak, yet it transforms, hence it is spirit. Speech injures it. The Dao does not value speech, so speech causes harm. Those who are spirit without speech carry nothing—the Dao values silence, and through it attains the spirit. *Carry* means to practice, to constantly enact its absence of speech. Speech injures the spirit. Those who attain the spirit find the Dao scorns speech, yet often revert to it, thus harming their own spirit.

The nose breathes, the ears hear—both ultimately employ what is without use as their use. *Without use* refers to the hollow spaces within the nose and ears. All things rely on what they possess to employ what they lack, using what is without use as their use.

To test this, observe the *lai* and the *yu*. The *lai* is a three-holed flute. Its hollow pipes produce sound. Thus it is said: observe the *lai* and the *yu*.

Those burdened by thoughts cannot sleep. As the *Book of Songs* says:
*"Restless, I cannot sleep,
As if weighed by deep sorrow."*
And again:
*"Tossing upon my pillow,
I sigh through waking and dreaming."*

To halt thoughts is to act upon what is halted. *Halt* means to remove. Forcibly suppressing thoughts is not true absence of thought, but merely stopping where things stop. When both are gone—thoughts and the forced cessation of thoughts—then utmost virtue is pure.

*Both* refers to thoughts and the forced absence of thoughts. Abandoning these two, the spirit is inwardly guarded, and utmost virtue becomes pure and unified.

The sage speaks of governance his whole life, yet what he employs is not his speech, but what underlies it. *Not his speech* means not his usual words. *What underlies it* refers to the words suited to governance.

A singer has lyrics, yet what makes people admire them is not the lyrics themselves. *Admire them* means admiring the clarity and harmony of the sound, not the lyrics. Thus it is said: not the lyrics.

The parrot can speak, yet cannot be made to lead. The parrot is a bird from Shu Commandery, with a red beak, its plumage pale green, able to mimic human speech. *Lead* means to preside. Why is this so?

To grasp their words but not their underlying meaning—
*To grasp their words* means knowing how to mimic human speech.
Yet not understanding the words of leadership and command,
thus it is said: not grasping their underlying meaning.

Therefore, those who follow tracks are not those who create them.
*Follow* means to trail after.
Tracing another’s old tracks, they cannot establish foundations or devise systems,
nor forge new paths themselves—
just as the parrot knows how to mimic speech but cannot produce the words of a leader.

The divine serpent can sever itself and rejoin,
yet cannot prevent others from severing it.
The sacred tortoise can appear in King Yuan of Song’s dreams,
yet cannot free itself from the fisherman’s basket.
King Yuan of Song once dreamed of obtaining a divine tortoise but had not yet captured it;
the fisherman Yu Ju caught the tortoise while fishing and presented it to the king,
who then split its shell for divination.
Thus it is said: it could appear in the king’s dream but could not escape the fisherman’s basket.

The four directions are all gates and windows of the Dao—
it depends on which one you peer through.

Thus, angling can teach riding,
riding can teach charioteering,
and charioteering can teach boat-piercing.
These four arts all require reverence and adherence to their principles,
hence they can be taught to one another.

The people of Yue learn long-range archery,
shooting toward the heavens,
yet their arrows land within five paces.
The people of Yue are skilled in water and boats,
but know nothing of archery—
shooting upward toward the sky,
the arrow’s force exhausts itself and falls back,
thus landing within five paces.
*Toward* means to aim at.
Yet they do not alter their method.
*Method* refers to the technique of archery.
Since they do not understand archery,
they do not know to abandon the practice of aiming at the heavens.

The world has already changed,
yet they cling to the old ways—
this is like the archery of the people of Yue.
It speaks of clinging to the past without knowing how to adapt.

At the full moon, the sun eclipses its light—
yin cannot overpower yang.
On the fifteenth day, when the moon and sun face each other directly,
a lunar eclipse occurs, thus the moon’s light is stolen.
If misaligned, it wanes; at the dark of the moon, it vanishes entirely.
Thus it is said: yin cannot overpower yang.

When the sun rises, the stars disappear—
they cannot contend with its brilliance.
Stars are yin; they cannot steal the sun’s light.

Thus, the branch cannot surpass the root in strength,
nor can the finger exceed the arm in size.
If the lower is light and the upper heavy,
it will surely topple.

A single abyss cannot hold two *jiao*.
*The jiao* is the chief of fish, its skin bearing pearls,
now used to adorn the hilts of swords and knives.
Another account says a fish of two thousand *jin* is called a *jiao*.

When water is still, it is clear and level;
when stirred, it loses its balance.
Thus, only by not moving can it be the source of all movement.

The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers can nourish the hundred valleys
because they lower themselves.
Only by lowering themselves can they rise.
*Rise* means to become great.

Nothing in the world is as mutually destructive as glue and lacquer—once bound, they cannot be separated, hence called "mutual hatred." Another account says: when glue enters lacquer, it spoils; when lacquer enters glue, it too is ruined—judged by their proportions, thus called "mutual hatred." Yet nothing is as mutually nurturing as ice and charcoal. When ice meets charcoal, it melts and returns to water, restoring its nature; when charcoal meets ice, it preserves its essence—hence called "mutual love." Glue and lacquer devour each other; ice and charcoal bring each other rest.

A crumbling wall is all the more upright in its collapse—earth reverts to its origin, returning to soil, thus called "all the more upright." Melting ice is all the more solid in its dissolution, for it returns to its source. *Pàn* means to release and return to water. *Zōng* means origin.

The form of Mount Tai looms majestic and towering—*róng* means shape. Yet a thousand *li* away, one sees neither mound nor ridge, for distance obscures them. *Duǒ-kě* is like a screen or veil. *Duǒ* is pronounced like *wàng*, as in the speech of those between the Yangtze and Huai rivers. It can be understood thus.

The tip of an autumn hair sinks into the unfathomable.

Thus, what is too small cannot serve as the inner, just as what is too great cannot serve as the outer. What is too small to be inner is even smaller than the tip of an autumn hair—this is called "non-being." Yet "non-being" without form is the utmost vastness, and cannot serve as the outer.

Orchids grow in secluded valleys, yet do not cease to be fragrant for lack of wearers—their nature is to be fragrant. A boat lies upon rivers and seas, yet does not cease to float for lack of passengers—its nature is to float. The noble one practices righteousness, yet does not cease or rest for lack of recognition—his nature is benevolence and righteousness.

Now jade is lustrous and radiant, its sound leisurely and modulated—*shū* means unhurried, *yáng* means restrained. How it resembles! It resembles the noble one. *Huàn* is pronounced as when people call a wealthy household "lord of the waist." Without inner or outer, it conceals no flaws or filth—without inner or outer, its surface and interior are one. *Nì* means to hide.

Draw near, and it moistens; gaze from afar, and it gleams. A mirror reflects the pupils of the eye, discerns the finest autumn hair, and illuminates the darkest depths.

Thus the Heshi jade and the Marquis of Sui’s pearl, born of the essence of mountains and deep pools—when the noble one wears them, he follows auspiciousness and attains tranquility. *Fu* means to wear. The noble one wears them as symbols, free from passions and desires, able to follow goodness and secure his person.

Kings and marquises treasure them, using them to rectify all under heaven. *Bao* means to value. Kings and marquises esteem their celestial nature as common folk esteem pearls and jade, thus employing them to govern all under heaven without partiality or self-interest.

When Chen Chengzi Heng coerced Ziyuan Jie, Chen Chengzi was about to kill Duke Jian of Qi, sending sixteen warriors to threaten his minister Ziyuan Jie, desiring to divide the state with him. Jie refused, hence it is called coercion. When Zihan declined what he did not desire—not desiring the king’s treasure—he obtained what he did desire: the treasure of non-greed.

When Confucius saw the cicada-catcher, it was during Baigong Sheng’s inverted staff. The inverted staff injured his forehead, blood flowing to his shoes yet he remained unaware, for his spirit was wholly absorbed. When Lady Wei pleaded for punishment before Duke Huan, Lady Wei was a daughter of Wei and wife of Duke Huan of Qi. Duke Huan harbored intentions to attack Wei; Lady Wei perceived his countenance and knew it, thus pleading for the duke’s execution to atone for Wei’s offense.

When Confucius saw Zixia and asked, “Why are you so plump?”—it was because the Way prevailed, free from passions and desires, hence his plumpness. When Marquis Wen of Wei saw him, he turned his fur robe inside out to carry hay, knowing that when the hide is worn through, the fur has nothing to cling to.

When Er Yue explained the untying of knots to the King of Song—knots that could not be untied—he untied them by not untying. All these are subtle and profound matters from which one may observe principles. *Wei miao* means to perceive the end from the beginning.

A man marrying off his daughter instructed her, saying, “Go now, and be careful not to do good.” She asked, “If I do not do good, shall I do evil instead?” He replied, “If goodness is left undone, how much more so evil?” This preserves one’s celestial endowment. *Qi* means nature. Mencius said human nature is good, hence it is called preserving one’s celestial nature.

Those confined in prison count the days as long; those condemned to die in the marketplace count the days as short. The length of days has its measure: where one’s heart is set, days seem short; where it is not, they seem long—thus the center is not at peace. *Zhong* means the heart. Therefore, those who take imbalance as balance—such balance is not true balance.

Marrying a daughter to one afflicted with consumption: if the husband dies, she will have difficulty remarrying. Taking the daughter as a curse upon the husband, later men dare not wed her, hence remarrying is difficult. Another explanation: the daughter, seeing all men as consumed, refuses to remarry.

Thus one cannot sit beneath a crumbling eave, nor stand beside a leaning wall, for fear of collapse and crushing. Those who preside over prisons and cells remain free from illness, for malevolent spirits fear them and thus do not afflict them. Those sentenced to death grow plump and lustrous, their minds resolved, free from external concerns. Another explanation: those condemned to death, their sentences decided, are without worry, hence their plumpness and luster.

Those who have been mutilated often live long, their hearts unburdened. *Xingzhe* refers to the castrated. Free from the burden of passions and desires, their spirit is not depleted, hence they often live long.

A skilled physician constantly treats illnesses before they arise, thus preventing illness—by rectifying the true nature, the spirit guards within, hence no illness. The sage constantly addresses calamities before they arise, thus preventing calamity. *Zhi* means to govern.

The supreme craftsman does not use a sword, for his skill lies in mind and hand. The master of closure does not use bolts or bars, for he closes his heart, and thus needs no bolts. This is akin to Chun Yükun’s warning of a fire: Chun Yükun was a man of Qi. He warned his neighbor that the chimney would cause a fire and urged him to bend the flue and move the firewood. The neighbor did not heed him, and later the fire indeed broke out. The one who warned received no reward, while those who extinguished the fire, their heads and brows scorched, were made honored guests—criticizing the failure to prepare in advance. It illustrates how people do not know to preemptively close their passions and desires, yet expect others to rescue them from disaster.

Entering the turbid from the clear brings distress and humiliation; entering the clear from the turbid brings ruin and collapse. The noble one’s approach to goodness is like a firewood gatherer who, upon seeing even a single blade, plucks it, and upon seeing verdant greens, pulls them up—nothing is left behind. The noble one’s practice of goodness is likewise.

When the two qi of heaven conjoin, a rainbow forms; when the two qi of earth conjoin, the hidden is released—yin and yang interact, the two qi. When the two qi of man conjoin, illness arises. The perverse qi invades the upright qi, hence illness.

Yin cannot be yang, nor yang yin; winter cannot be summer, nor summer winter. The moon knows not day, nor the sun night—each cannot encompass the other.

The master archer never misses the mark, skilled in archery yet unskilled in what he shoots. What he shoots dies, hence it is called unskillful. The master angler never fails to catch, skilled in fishing yet unskillful in what he catches. What he catches is fish, hence unskillful toward the fish. Thus where there is skill, there is also lack of skill.

When bells and chimes are near, the bell’s sound is full—*chong* means great. When far, the chime’s sound is distinct—*qing* is stone, its sound clear and bright, audible from afar and distinctly manifest. Some things are naturally better near than far, others better far than near.

Now rice grows in water yet cannot grow in swift rapids; *tuan* means rushing water. Purple mushrooms grow on mountains yet cannot grow on solid rock, for their roots have nowhere to take hold. Lodestone attracts iron, yet with copper, it does not work—*xing* means to cause, unable to make it follow.

Where waters are vast, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall. To expand one’s land while thinning one’s virtue is like a potter shaping vessels—kneading and pressing the clay without adding thickness, so that breakage comes all the sooner. *Yu* means "increasing"; *ji* means "swift." *Die* is read as in *die mai* (pulse-taking).

The sage does not act before the wind blows or before thunder strikes; only when compelled does he move, and thus remains unburdened. When the moon waxes and wanes above, the snail responds below—shared *qi* stirs in resonance. *Dong* means "to move," "to be moved." This cannot be considered distant. When the moon waxes, the snail’s flesh diminishes, hence it is said that the snail responds below. The moon is yin essence; the snail is also yin, thus they share the same *qi*. Though they may resonate, it cannot be called distant.

Holding a sling to summon birds or waving a whip to call dogs—desiring to draw them near, one only drives them away. Thus fish cannot be hooked without bait, nor beasts lured with an empty vessel. *Zhao* means "to summon," "to draw near."

To flay an ox’s hide and stretch it into a drum to command the three armies—yet for the ox’s sake, it would be better to serve beneath the yoke. A robe of white fox fur may clothe the Son of Heaven as he sits in the ancestral temple, yet for the fox’s sake, it would be better to run through the marshes. This speaks to the value of life.

To lose a sheep and gain an ox is to see no disadvantage; to sever a finger and save one’s head is to see no disadvantage in the act. Thus human nature, amid profit, contends for the greater gain, and amid harm, contends for the lesser loss.

A general dares not ride a white horse, for fear of being recognized. Another explanation: white is mourning garb, so he dares not ride it. As the tradition says, when Duke Xiang of Jin joined forces with the Jiang Rong and wore black mourning clothes, he defeated the Qin army at Xiāo—this speaks to altering mourning attire, hence the reluctance to ride a white horse.

A fugitive dares not carry a torch at night, for fear of being seen. A city guard dares not keep a biting dog. *Bao* refers to those who dwell within city walls. The guard, though well-provided, dares not keep a dog that bites.

When the cock crows at dawn, the crane knows it is midnight—yet this does not spare it from the cauldron. To scheme with ignorance is to remain unable to escape the cauldron. This is to say that a general must possess all five virtues and cannot act without adaptability.

Where mountains harbor fierce beasts, the forest trees go uncut; where gardens harbor stinging insects, the wild greens go unpicked. This speaks to human fear.

To be a Confucian scholar yet lounge in the lanes and alleys—Confucians esteem ritual and propriety, yet lounging in the lanes is improper. To be a Mohist yet play the reed pipes in Chaoge—Mohism values frugality and disdains music, and Chaoge was a place Mozi refused to enter; playing the pipes is improper.

To seek to erase one’s tracks by running through snow, or to rescue a drowning man without getting wet—these are acts of impossibility, doing what cannot be done.

Now, the blind drinker may not fail to spill his wine, but if he measures it himself, even a fool will not err. Thus there is nothing in the world that can succeed without harmony. *He* means "fitting," "proper."

To seek beauty is not to obtain beauty; not to seek beauty is to attain it. If the heart seeks a beautiful name, it will not gain a beautiful name; yet to diminish oneself is to earn a beautiful name.

Thus Laozi said: "Excessive pursuit of carriages results in no carriages." To seek ugliness is not to obtain ugliness; to seek not-ugliness is to invite ugliness. To seek neither beauty nor ugliness is to be without beauty or ugliness—this is called "mysterious sameness." *Xuan* means "Heaven." Heaven seeks nothing. If a person can seek nothing, they become one with it.

Shentu Di carried a stone and drowned himself in the depths, yet this does not make the drowning virtuous. Shentu Di was a man of the late Yin who could not bear to witness King Zhou’s tyranny, so he drowned himself. *Kang* means "lofty." When Xian Gao deceived to save Zheng, deceit cannot be made a constant. There are responses that fit the moment but cannot be followed as a rule. Xian Gao falsified the Zheng lord’s command, offering twelve oxen to reward the Qin army and thus repelling them—hence it is said that he deceived to save Zheng. Deceit is not upright, so it cannot be made a constant.

A man of many words is like the cry of the hundred-tongued bird. The hundred-tongued bird is a bird that can shift its tongue to mimic the calls of a hundred birds—hence its name. This is to say that though a person may speak much, it avails nothing.

A man of few words is like an unoiled door. This speaks to its silence, hence unoiled, a metaphor for no sound. Another explanation: an unoiled door is hard to open and close, also a metaphor for a man of few words.

When the six domestic animals grow extra ears or eyes, it is considered inauspicious, as recorded in the books of prophecy. *Xiang* means "auspicious." Extra ears or eyes are seen as omens of misfortune. This is to say that a person of many words and little sincerity is likened to the inauspicious.

A hundred men lifting a float are not as effective as one man carrying it and running. *Kang* means "to lift"; *fu* means "raft." A hundred men lifting together are not as efficient as one man holding it and moving swiftly. Some things, though many, are not as good as few—like pulling a cart, which requires two teams of six before it moves. The shaft requires three men, and each side of the shaft six, hence "two sixes." Another explanation: twelve men. Some things depend on mutual support to succeed—two men drowning cannot save each other, but one on land can.

Thus the same cannot govern itself; it must await the different before it can be completed. *Same* means the ruler says "yes" and the minister also says "yes," the ruler says "no" and the minister also says "no"—like adding water to water, who can consume it? This is called "same," and thus cannot govern. *Different* means supporting the ruler’s "yes," replacing the ruler’s "no," guiding him toward the proper path—this is called "different," and thus can accomplish things.

A thousand-year-old pine has *fuling* beneath it and dodder above...

The *fuling* is the resin of a thousand-year-old pine. The dodder grows upon it without roots, also called *nüluo*. Above it thrives a thicket of milfoil; beneath it hides a crouching tortoise. The sage perceives the inner from the outer, knowing the hidden through what is seen.

Delighting in martial prowess is not true chivalry—chivalry is lightness. Delighting in letters is not true Confucianism; fondness for remedies is not true medicine; love of horses is not true horsemanship; understanding music is not true musicianship; discerning flavors is not true cookery. These six arts are all practiced with skill yet lack mastery, having no proper name—thus they are called "skilled in one aspect but without a defining term."

Wearing armor is not for combat within ten paces; beyond a hundred paces, the contest lies in depth—deep strikes reach the five viscera, shallow ones stop at the skin. The distance between life and death cannot be measured in miles; it is spoken of as immeasurable.

When the King of Chu lost his gibbon, the forest was ravaged for it. The King of Chu refers to King Zhuang during his travels. Gibbons are swift and restless, dwelling in trees, so the forest was destroyed in the search. When the Lord of Song lost his pearl, the fish in the ponds were exhausted. When fire spreads through the marshes, the forests grow anxious—anxiety arises from impending harm.

When the ruler seeks timber, ministers ravage the woods; when the ruler seeks fish, ministers drain the valleys. When the ruler asks for oars, the people provide boats; when the ruler speaks in silk threads, the people respond in thick cords. A single cord is a great line. When the ruler has one virtue, the people offer two praises; when the ruler has three faults, the people bring nine condemnations. Faults and condemnations are both metaphors for excess. As the saying goes, what the ruler favors, the people favor even more—hence the nine condemnations.

Minister Zhong knew how to strengthen Yue but not how to preserve himself—he was ultimately killed by Yue. Chang Hong knew how to preserve Zhou but not how to save himself—he was killed by Zhou. They knew the distant but not the near. The distant refers to strengthening Yue and preserving Zhou; the near refers to themselves.

Fearing a horse’s bolting, one dares not ride; dreading a carriage’s overturning, one dares not board—thus emptying misfortune while rejecting public benefit. Those who are unfilial or disobedient may curse their parents, yet those who bear children cannot guarantee their filial piety—still, they raise and nurture them.

When the Fan clan fell, a thief stole their bells and fled. The Fan clan refers to Fan Jishe, great-grandson of Fan Hui, son of Fan Yang, the Viscount Zhaozhi. Their fall came when Zhao Jianzi attacked them, prompting the theft of their bells. Another account says Zhi Bo destroyed the Fan clan. The bells clanged loudly, and in fear of being heard, the thief hastily covered his ears. If others heard, so be it; covering his own ears was folly—confusion.

The *sheng* cannot exceed the *dan* in size, for the *sheng* lies within the *dan*; night cannot prolong the year, for night lies within the year; benevolence and righteousness cannot surpass the Dao and virtue, for benevolence and righteousness are enveloped by the Dao and virtue. Benevolence and righteousness are small, while the Dao and virtue are great. They are contained within the Dao and virtue as the *sheng* is within the *dan*, as night is within the year.

First the needle, then the thread—thus a curtain may be made; first the thread, then the needle—thus no garment can be completed. With needles, one makes tents; with baskets, one builds walls. The success or failure of affairs must arise from the small—this speaks of gradual progression. A *mu* is a curtain: the top is called *mu*, the sides *wei*. Without needles, thread cannot pass through, so they must come first. A *léi* is a basket for earth. Beginning with a single basketful, one piles it upon the wall—thus it is said that the success or failure of affairs must arise from the small.

A dyer must first apply blue, then black—this is permissible; first black, then blue—this is not. A craftsman must first apply lacquer, then vermilion—this is permissible; first vermilion, then lacquer—this is not. All things are like this: what comes first or last, above or below, must be carefully considered. To consider is to know.

When water grows turbid, fish gasp at the surface, their gills pale and gaping as they strain for air above the water. Bodily toil disrupts the spirit; when the body is disordered, the spirit cannot govern.

Thus a state with a worthy ruler repels enemy assaults from a thousand miles away. *Qú* are war chariots, used to breach enemy walls—this means that a worthy ruler’s virtue cannot be assailed, so he can shatter the enemy’s assault chariots far beyond his borders, preventing their approach. When Marquis Wen of Wei honored and humbled himself before Duan Ganmu, the armies of Qin dared not advance: this is what it means.

One marries through a matchmaker, yet the marriage is not made by the matchmaker—it is ritual that establishes the household. One befriends through an intermediary, yet closeness does not come through the intermediary—it is virtue that draws near.

Those whose paths align and steps converge will follow one another across a thousand miles, no matter the distance; those whose aims diverge and ways part will not speak even when facing each other across a doorstep. As the *Odes* says: though the chamber is near, the person is far—hence the saying, “facing the door yet no communication.”

Though the sea is vast, it does not accept rotting bones or mustard seeds. The sun and moon do not respond to what is not their *qi*; the yang-burning mirror draws fire, the square vessel gathers water—only when *qi* corresponds does it answer. Without this, nothing is obtained, so it is said they do not respond to what is not their *qi*.

The noble person does not tolerate what is not of his kind. People do not love Chui’s hands but love their own fingers—*Chui* is read as *zhuì* in the *Odes*, as in “trembling with fear.” Chui was Yao’s master craftsman; even the most skillful cannot love his hands for Chui’s sake. They say Chui’s hands bring no benefit to themselves, so they cherish their own fingers instead. They do not prize the pearls of the Yangtze and Han but treasure their own fishhook. Though the Yangtze and Han hold fine pearls, they are of no use to oneself, so they are not prized. A hook, however, can catch fish—hence they value it.

They mistake bundled firewood for a ghost, taking rising smoke for its *qi*. Seeing bundled firewood, they flee in terror, thinking it a ghost. Taking the smoke of a fire for an omen of fortune or misfortune, they slaughter pigs and boil dogs to avert it—such delusion! Those who act thus prematurely fare worse than those who proceed with caution.

The skillful excel at measurement; the wise excel at foresight. *Yu* means preparation. Yi died by the peach-wood club and could not draw his bow in time; Qing Ji died by the sword’s edge and could not grapple in time. *Taobu* is a place name. Yi was a lord of the Xia, ruler of Youqiong, slain by his disciple Pang Meng before he could ready his shot. *Bo* means swift action.

Cen Ji was the son of King Liao of Wu. When Yao Li of the Heng Gate assassinated him, he perished by the sword before he could deploy his swift and agile strength.

Those who seek to extinguish slander announce at their door, "I truly had no part in this flattery or chaos." Yet slander only arises all the more. Attempting to quell words with words or halt affairs with affairs is like scattering dust to suppress dust or carrying firewood to extinguish a fire. To silence words, one should remain silent; to halt affairs, one should divine. Now, to suppress words with words or stop affairs with affairs is like scattering dust to quell dust—only to stir it further—or carrying firewood to put out a fire—only to fan its flames.

Rumors stain like black dye on white silk. *Liu* means to spread; *xue* means to remove. *Nie* is black; *su* is white. An arrow may pierce armor at ten paces but fail to penetrate Lu gauze at three hundred; a fine steed may gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet upon reaching its destination, it collapses from exhaustion. *Shi* means to unharness; *jiang* means to fall. Like an arrow at three hundred paces failing to pierce Lu gauze, this speaks of strength spent and momentum exhausted.

When a great family attacks a small one, it is called tyranny; when a great state annexes a small one, it is called virtue. The Xia dynasty, for ten generations, could not esteem virtue, resorting instead to toil and force, deeming those who seized borders and annexed states as worthy. A small horse is not of the same kind as a great horse; petty knowledge is not of the same kind as great knowledge. A small horse cannot advance the Way to reach a thousand *li*, thus it is not of the same kind as a great horse. Petty knowledge cannot govern the world or lead the people, thus it is not of the same kind as great knowledge.

Wearing a sheepskin to hire oneself out is fitting; wearing a sable robe while carrying a basket is truly strange. The basket is a basket for earth. To treat purity as defilement is like bathing and then scooping filth or perfuming oneself and then carrying a pig. *Xun sui* means burning incense; the people of Chu call it *xun sui*. To treat an abscess, one does not discriminate between good flesh, bad flesh, or ugly flesh—all are cut away. A farmer does not distinguish between seedlings and weeds—all are uprooted. Is this not futile?

Breaking a dike to catch a turtle, tearing down a house to seek a wildcat, digging up a chamber to find a rat, or cutting one’s lips to treat a cavity—such are the ways of Jie and Zhi, with whom the noble person does not associate. Those who conduct affairs in this manner are like Jie and Zhi; the noble person does not partake. To slaughter a warhorse in pursuit of a fox, to grasp two soft-shelled turtles and lose a sacred tortoise, to sever one’s right arm for a single hair, or to break a *Mo Xie* sword for a small knife—those who employ their wisdom thus, how can their posterity be esteemed? *Gao* means esteem.

Better a hundred pricks with a needle than one with a blade; better to pull a heavy load once than to carry a light one for long. Better to hunger for a month than to starve for ten days. *Ji* means insufficient food; *e* means exhaustion. The tracks of ten thousand people surpass the pitfall of one. The people of Chu call *ji* (tracks) *qi*. *Yu* means to surpass; *sui* means a pitfall.

One who praises another for their diligence and frugality may pound grain until dawn, yet if it does not meet the standard, they still rebuke them. Upon closer inspection, it was their mother. *Zhe* means to reproach. To praise someone for diligence and frugality, then rebuke them for failing to meet the standard—this is the way of it. When the noble person sees this, they realize the mother was laboring for her child. To praise someone thus—how is it better than slandering them? Hence the saying: "Ask who slandered them, and it was the petty person who praised them." This is what it means. Thus, the praise of a petty person becomes a detriment. *Sun* means to harm.

When the mother of the eastern household died, her son wept without sorrow. The son of the western household saw this and returned to tell his mother, "Why does She love to die so soon? I will surely weep bitterly for She." Along the Jiang and Huai, mother is called *she*. *She* is read as in "Ah She," where the people of Su and Jia call their father *gong*. One who wishes for their mother’s death, even if she dies, cannot weep in sorrow.

To say one has no time to study is like those who, though idle, cannot learn. To speak of being occupied with affairs and having no time to study—such people, even when at leisure, cannot learn.

Seeing hollow wood float, one knows to make a boat; seeing tumbleweed roll, one knows to make a cart; seeing bird tracks, one knows to create writing—all are taken by analogy. *Kuan* means hollow and is read as *ke*. To take what is not righteous as righteous, what is not ritual as ritual, is like running naked in pursuit of a madman, stealing wealth to give to a beggar, secretly copying laws, or squatting while reciting the *Odes* and *Documents*.

To cut and then abandon it, even a *Mo Xie* sword cannot sever flesh; to grasp and not release it, even a horse’s tail can cut jade. *Mao* is a horse’s tail. The sage does not stagnate; they do not compare past years to deem the present worthy, for each day surpasses the last. *Xian* and *yu* mean to surpass, as in *xuan wen*. It speaks of the present year surpassing the past and today surpassing yesterday, illustrating the sage’s self-cultivation and progress.

A horse resembling a deer is worth a thousand gold, yet there is no deer in the world worth a thousand gold. Jade becomes an implement only after being worked by *jian zhu*; *jian zhu* is the stone that polishes jade. It speaks of things that become valuable through what is base. *Jian* means sharp; some simply call it *lan*. A jade disc worth a thousand gold has no use for a *zi zhui* of *jian zhu*. Six *zhu* make a *zi*, eight *zhu* make a *zhui*—it speaks of its baseness.

Receiving light through a crack illuminates one corner; receiving light through a window illuminates the northern wall; receiving light through a door illuminates the entire room without leaving anything unseen—how much more so when receiving light from the cosmos? There is nothing in the world that does not borrow brightness from what precedes it. From this, we see: what one receives is small, so what one perceives is shallow; what one receives is great, so what one illuminates is vast. *Yu* refers to the four directions and above and below; *zhou* refers to past and present—it speaks of the space within the four limits and between heaven and earth. Thus, nothing in the world does not borrow brightness from the sun and moon.

The Yangzi flows from Mount Min, the Yellow River from Kunlun, the Ji from Wangwu, the Ying from Shaoshi, and the Han from Mount Bozhong—these have already been explained in the *Treatise on Terrain*.

The rivers diverge and race, two streams pouring into the Eastern Sea—though their courses differ, their destination is one. "One" means unity. For those who master the Dao, it is like the axle of a chariot: though the hub itself does not move, it carries the wheel a thousand *li*, ever turning, beginning anew without end, revolving from an inexhaustible source. Those who fail to master the Dao are like the lost: though told of east and west, south and north, they remain bewildered, their understanding dim—so deep is their confusion. Turning away, they grasp nothing, unaware of the essential. Turning away, they grow only more perplexed, thus knowing nothing of the fundamental.

Cold cannot generate cold; heat cannot generate heat. Only what is neither cold nor hot can generate both cold and heat. Thus, form emerges from formlessness. Before heaven and earth existed, nothing could have given birth to them—so profound, so subtle, so vast is this truth. In the beginning, before heaven and earth, that which generated heaven and earth arose, and thus the formless gave rise to form.

Rain falls, yet nothing is drenched until it ceases; only when it stops can it truly soak. The arrow flies, yet nothing is pierced until it comes to rest; only when it stops can it truly penetrate. Only stillness can halt all motion. Stillness is like the arrow that stops to pierce its target. Another interpretation: only by stilling one’s own passions and desires can one still the myriad things, preventing them from acting against their nature.

One builds a terrace by ascending high ground, a pond by descending low—each follows its natural advantage, daring not alter it. The sage employs things as one ties straw dogs with red silk or fashions earthen dragons to summon rain. Straw dogs are revered to invoke blessings—here, "invoke" means "attain." One relies on the straw dog’s power to secure good fortune. Earthen dragons bring rain, and rain yields grain, so one depends on the earthen dragon’s spirit to obtain food. Another interpretation: earthen dragons are used in rain prayers to secure offerings of wine and meat.

A man of Lu was skilled at making hats, his wife adept at weaving shoes. They moved to Yue but fell into dire poverty, for they carried their craft to a land where it was unneeded. It is like planting lotus on a mountaintop—lotus, an aquatic plant, also called *fuqu*. Its stem is the *jia*, its base the *mi*, its root the *ou*, its flower the *furong*, its bud the *hanjiu*, and its seedpod the *lian*. The finest lotus bears flowers, and at the heart of the flower lies the *yi*. In Youzhou, all these are collectively called *guang*. (The word *he* is pronounced as *hutong* in the dialect of Yan when referring to the Qin.) Yet they tried to raise it in a fiery well. To wield a fishing rod on a mountain or an axe in the depths of a lake—how could one obtain what one seeks? To ride a chariot in Yue or a raft into Hu—*fang* means "to depart," *zhi* means "to arrive," and *fu* is a raft, also called a gourd—is to use tools where they do not belong. To desire what is unattainable is futile, for one seeks where nothing can be found.

The King of Chu possessed a white ape. When the king himself shot at it, the ape caught the arrows and played with them. But when Yang You, a minister of the king, took aim, the moment he drew his bow and straightened his arrow, the ape clutched a pillar and howled. *You* was his name, a subject of the king. *Tiao* means to draw the bow, and *jiao* means to straighten the arrow.

"To *yong* means to embrace; *hao* means to cry out. The *You Tong Fu* states, 'Yang You cast his sidelong glance, and the ape howled'—this is the case. There are those who hit the mark first, and there are those whose subtle precision ensures a hit before the arrow is loosed, for their essence and appearance stir in unison.

The jade disc of the Guo clan, the jade pendant of the Xia sovereign—when offered with bows and deference, they bring harmony; when hurled at someone in the night, they breed resentment. It is a matter of timing or its absence. *Not timing* refers to night. *Guo* is an ancient form of *he* (harmony).

To paint the face of Xi Shi—though beautiful, it cannot delight; to sketch the eyes of Meng Ben—though large, they cannot inspire awe. For the *ruler of form* is absent. The *sheng qi* (vital qi) is the ruler of the human form. To depict a human form without *sheng qi* is to say the *ruler of form* is lost.

When brothers divide their inheritance, though the amounts may be immeasurable and countless, the multitude calls it *yi* (righteousness). Precisely because it is immeasurable, it cannot be measured.

Ascending heights makes one long to gaze afar; peering into depths makes one long to peer further—such is the nature of the place. Archers compel others to stand upright; anglers make others reverent—such is the nature of the task. Only after standing aright does one hit the mark; only after reverence does one obtain the catch. Thus it is said, 'such is the nature of the task.'

It is said that slaughtering a weary ox can redeem a fine horse from death, yet none do so. Slaughtering an ox is a fate of certain ruin. Oxen are what cultivate the grain, the lifeblood of the people. Thus the king’s law forbids killing oxen, and those who violate the prohibition are executed. Hence it is called a fate of certain ruin. To use what is doomed to redeem what is not necessarily doomed—none have yet been able to practice this.

The Ji Sun clan coerced the ducal house. Ji Huanzi Si (also called Kangzi Fei), a grandee of Lu, intimidated Duke Ding and monopolized his governance. The *Annals* state, 'The emoluments departed from the ducal house.' Confucius persuaded him, first acquiescing to his actions, then joining him in governance, saying, 'Whether crooked or straight, how could one not attain it?' Yet when straightening crookedness, do not follow it to its end. Acquiesce to his schemes and comply, but do not proceed to extremes—join in minor matters. This is what is meant by 'sharing filth yet treading different paths.'

The multitude’s crookedness cannot tolerate straightness; the multitude’s perversity cannot tolerate uprightness. Thus, when people are many, they devour the wolf; when wolves are many, they devour people. Those who wish to act perversely must first clarify uprightness; those who wish to act crookedly must first grasp straightness. That the public Way does not stand while private desires find acceptance—from ancient times to the present, this has never been heard of. This is using goodness to cloak its ugliness. *Tuo* means to entrust. Like Li Ji, who wished to kill Crown Prince Shenzhu, first praised him to Duke Xian, then carried out her harm—this is of the same kind.

When the clamor of many opinions forms a forest, it flies without wings. When all people discuss it, a forest grows on level ground, and wingless birds take flight. All believe it to be true. Three men make a market tiger: three men return from the market, all claiming there is a tiger there. Though the market is no place for tigers, people believe one exists. Thus it is said, 'Three men make a market tiger.' A single village bends the mighty. *Nao* means weak. When all in a village claim someone can bend the mighty, people believe it.

The swimmer does not seek to bathe—he is already content within. Thus, beasts that eat grass do not hastily leave the marsh; *ji* means to rest. Aquatic creatures do not hastily leave the water. They undergo minor changes without losing their constancy. *Minor changes* refer to leaving water or grass. They eat grass because they are grass-eaters; they dwell in water because they are aquatic. Thus it is said they do not hastily lose their constancy.

There is trust that violates ritual propriety and thus loses it. Weisheng died beneath the bridge pillar—this was misplaced trust. Weisheng, a man of Lu, had a secret tryst with a woman beneath a bridge. He honored his oath so deeply that when the waters rose, he did not leave and drowned. Thus it is said his trust was misplaced. The Kong clan did not mourn their divorced mother—this was a lapse in ritual. According to ritual, a concubine’s son mourns his divorced mother for a year. The Kong clan refers to Zishang, whose courtesy name was Baizhong, the great-grandson of Confucius and son of Kong Ji. Later, Zibai’s mother died abroad. The *Records* state, 'When Zishang’s mother died, he did not mourn.' A disciple asked Zisi, 'Did your late lord mourn his divorced mother?' He replied, 'Yes.' 'Then why did he not make Baizhong do so?'"

He replied, "In former times, our late lord never strayed from the Dao. When the Dao flourished, he flourished with it; when the Dao was defiled, he was defiled with it. How could Ji act contrary to this? It was not that Ji refused to treat her as a wife, but that he refused to treat her as Bai’s mother. The Kong clan’s failure to mourn a divorced mother began with Zisi. Thus it is said this was the Kong clan’s lapse.

Zengzi established filial piety, yet would not pass through the lane named ‘Victorious Mother.’ Mozi rejected music, yet would not enter the city of Chaoge. Zengzi upheld integrity, yet would not drink from the Robber’s Spring. These are what is meant by ‘nurturing the will.’

When Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi sighed in lament. Seeing the ivory chopsticks, he knew that jade cups would follow, and with jade cups, there would surely be bear paws and leopard fetuses to indulge every extravagance. Thus Jizi cried out in alarm.

When Lu buried the dead with wooden figurines, Confucius sighed, detesting their resemblance to humans and their use. He knew that later generations would surely use living persons as sacrifices, and so he sighed deeply.

Thus the sage sees frost and knows ice is coming. When a light frost descends, the great cold will follow, and solid ice will form.

If a bird is about to come, one sets a net to await it. The one who catches the bird is but a single mesh of the net. If one were to set a net of only one mesh, there would be no time one could catch a bird.

Now, those who don armor do so to prepare for unforeseen calamities. If one could always know where danger would strike, a single wooden plaque would suffice.

Some matters cannot be foreseen, and some things cannot be anticipated. Sudden and unforeseen events arise, so the sage accumulates the Dao to await the moment. The Dao can equalize transformations, and there is nothing it does not bestow. Thus the sage nurtures it to await the time, and when the time comes, responds—like King Wu’s campaign against Zhou.

Kuntun was a homely ox, already lacking horns and tail, its nose pierced and bridled. Kuntun describes its ugly appearance. A plow ox is not of pure color. *Ke* means hornless. The missing character refers to tailless. Its nose was pierced and a bridle placed to lead it.

When a calf was born, it was offered as a sacrificial victim. The spirit medium fasted and performed rites to sink it into the river. A *xi* is a sacrificial animal. The *shi* is the one who presides over the sacrifice to the spirits. The *zhu* offers prayers for blessings. To sacrifice to the River Lord is called *chen*. Would the River Lord be ashamed of its origins and refuse to accept the offering?

The *Book of Songs* says, ‘Gather the turnips, gather the radishes, yet do not discard their roots.’ The *Analects* says, ‘The calf of a plow ox is ruddy and well-horned. Though one might wish not to use it, would the mountains and rivers cast it aside?’

To command an army of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing a single apt word. *Apt* means understanding the seasons and terrain, knowing men—this is how one can subdue an enemy’s forces without battle.

To obtain the Marquis of Sui’s pearl is not as good as obtaining the means to accomplish a task. To obtain the He’s jade disc is not as good as obtaining the proper course for a matter. *Means* refers to use. *Proper course* refers to what is fitting.

One selects a fine horse not to chase foxes and raccoon dogs, but to shoot elk and deer. One sharpens a keen sword not to cut silk garments, but to sever rhinoceros and buffalo.

Thus, ‘The lofty mountain—one looks up to it; the great path—one follows it.’ Long ago, there were those who said: ‘Before a high mountain, I look up and halt; before a great man, I emulate and follow him.’ Thus it is said, ‘Long ago, such a man.’

Seeing a slingshot, one seeks roasted owl. A slingshot can be used to shoot an owl, yet one seeks roasted meat because of it. Seeing an egg, one seeks the crowing of dawn and night. The rooster knows the approach of dawn, the crane knows midnight. Seeing its egg, one thus anticipates its nighttime call, hence ‘seeks the crowing of dawn and night.’

Seeing hemp seeds, one seeks finished cloth. Though this is reasonable, it is not too late. *Fen* refers to hemp with seeds. It can be made into cloth, so one seeks its completion. Thus it is said, ‘Though this is reasonable, it is not too late’—meaning one acts early. *Fen* is read in the *Commentary* as ‘having seeds does not bring disaster.’

The elephant sheds its tusks, not resenting others for taking them. *Taking* means to seize. The dead discard their funeral biers, not begrudging others for taking them. *Zhaozhe* refers to the washing board on the deceased’s bed. *Resent* is the same as *detest*, differing only in literary style. *Ze* is read like the *ji* in *gongji* (merit).

If one can use what is not advantageous to oneself to benefit others, then it is acceptable. *What is not advantageous* refers to how Zihan did not profit from another’s treasure. *Benefit* is like how the jade merchant obtained the jade and made it his treasure. Thus it is said to be acceptable.

A madman runs east, and his pursuer also runs east. Running east, they are the same, yet the reason for running east differs. A drowning man enters the water, and his rescuer also enters the water. Entering the water, they are the same, yet the reason for entering the water differs. The difference lies in not drowning.

Thus the sage treats life and death as one, and the fool also treats life and death as one. The sage’s unity of life and death is grounded in understanding principle and fate; the fool’s unity of life and death arises from ignorance of where benefit and harm lie.

King Yan of Xu lost his state through benevolence and righteousness, yet those who lose their states are not necessarily benevolent and righteous. Xu is today’s Xiapi, Xu, and Tong. *Yan* is his posthumous name. Living in an age of chaos and disorder, he cultivated benevolence and righteousness and was destroyed by King Wen of Chu. Most who are destroyed do so through unrighteousness, thus it is said that losing a state is not necessarily due to benevolence and righteousness.

Bi Gan was dismembered for his loyalty, yet those who are executed are not necessarily loyal. Bi Gan was executed for remonstrating with Zhou. The world sees that many who remonstrate do so without loyalty, thus it is said that those who are executed are not necessarily loyal.

Thus, one shivers from cold, and the fearful also shiver—this is sameness in name but difference in reality. They share the name *shivering*, yet differ in that one shivers from cold, the other from fear. *Shiver* is read like the *zhan* in ‘shivering from the cold,’ and is written the same.

The luminous moon pearl comes from the conch; the Zhou’s plain jade tablet is born from rough stone. The pearl called ‘luminous moon’ is born within the conch. The *jian gui*, a large jade tablet, is fine jade born from stone, thus it is said to be ‘born from rough stone.’

The great Cai divine tortoise comes from the ditches. *Great Cai* is the name of the place where the primordial tortoise emerged, and thus the tortoise is named *Great Cai*. This refers to the tortoise kept by Zang Wenzhong.

A ruler of ten thousand chariots wears a crown of mere ounces and rides in a carriage worth a hundred gold."

Six *zhu* make a *zi*, eight *liang* make a *zhui*—this speaks of their meager worth.

Some things are base yet placed above, others noble yet placed below. *Carriage* may also be written as *to tread*. Oxhide is deemed lowly, yet it orders the ranks of the three armies. The drum’s sound stirs the *qi*, and thus can align the multitudes of the three armies.

One who wishes to learn singing must first master the *zheng* and *yu* modes of the *feng* music. *Zheng* is the fire of the south; *yu* is the water of the north. When the five notes are correct, the music is correct. Nothing moves heaven and earth, stirs ghosts and spirits, more closely than poetry and music. *Feng* is how the above transforms the below, and the below admonishes the above—hence it is called *feng*.

One who desires harmonious beauty must first begin with *Yang’e* and *Cai Ling*. *Yang’e* and *Cai Ling* are harmonious melodies. *Yang’e* is an ancient name for a non-*fei* melody, renowned for its harmony.

All these seek to learn what they have not learned in order to reach what they desire. The cicada-illuminator focuses on brightening his flame; the angler focuses on scenting his bait. Brightening the flame is how one lures the cicada; scenting the bait is how one entices the fish. *Yao* means bright; *fang* means fragrant. When the flame is bright and the bait fragrant, cicadas and fish will come. In governing a state, if one brightens virtue and beautifies governance, the people of the world will gather like cicadas and fish to a bright flame and fragrant bait.

One who wishes to attract fish must first channel the waters; one who wishes to attract birds must first plant trees. Where waters gather, fish congregate; where trees flourish, birds alight.

The skilled fowler first prepares his *jiao* and *zeng*. *Jiao* is a large fishing line; *zeng* is a short arrow. The *jiao* is for striking—it shoots flying birds. As the *Odes* say, “Shooting the swan and the wild goose.”

The skilled angler first prepares his *gu* and *fu*. *Fu* is a fine net. The *Traditions* say, “Dense nets do not enter the turbid pond.” *Fu* is a large net. As the *Odes* say, “Setting the net with a splash, the perch and sturgeon leap.” Never has one gained advantage without the proper tools. This means one has never seen a lord without the Way who could win the people’s hearts.

To give a man a horse yet untie its bridle, to give a man a carriage yet remove its *yi*—the *yi* being what secures the crossbar—is to love little yet lose much. Thus the village saying goes: “To boil an ox without washing is to ruin the endeavor.” Without salt, the broth is not broth—hence it is called ruining the endeavor. The *Records of Ritual* say, “The guest stirs the broth; the host declines, saying he cannot cook.” This shows he knows how to make broth.

Jie had an accomplishment: he knew to make tiles to roof houses, leaving a legacy for later generations. Yao had a failing: *yi* means loss. This refers to his inability to banish the Four Fiends and employ the Sixteen Ministers. Another explanation: not passing the throne to Dan Zhu but abdicating to Shun, earning the reputation of lacking filial piety—hence it is said he had a failing.

Momu had her beauty. Momu was an ugly woman of old, yet her conduct was upright—hence it is said she had her beauty. *Mo* is read like the *mo* in “model.”

Xishi had her ugliness. Xishi was a beautiful woman of old. Though her appearance was radiant, her character was not necessarily upright—hence it is said she had her ugliness.

Thus, the laws of a ruined state may have aspects worth following, and the customs of a well-governed state may have aspects worth criticizing. *Worth following* is like Momu having her beauty; *worth criticizing* is like Xishi having her ugliness.

The *wan* and *yan* jades lie in filthy mud, yet even the incorruptible do not cast them aside. *Wan* and *yan* are fine jades; *shi* means to abandon. A cracked steamer or a chipped pot sits atop a fine mat, yet even the greedy do not seize them. *Qiong* is the band of the steamer; *bo* means to take. *Qiong* is read like the *meng* in *qing meng*.

Where beauty resides, though it be in filth and disgrace, the world cannot deem it lowly. Where ugliness resides, though it be in lofty heights, the world cannot deem it noble. *The world cannot deem it lowly* alludes to the worthy in humble, base positions; *the world cannot deem it noble* alludes to the unworthy in high, exalted positions.

Spring loans and autumn levies gladden the people—hungry in spring, they are given; abundant in autumn, they repay. Spring levies and autumn loans enrage the masses. Gain and loss are the same; joy and anger differ because the timing is not.

The virtue of fish is not to be carried into the depths; the gift to apes is not to be borne up trees—let them go where they belong. This is like governance: when offices are properly ordered, the literary take literary posts, the martial take martial posts—hence it is said, “Let them go where they belong.”

A marten-fur robe with mixed pelts is not as fine as a fox-fur robe of pure hue. *Mixed* means variegated; *pure* means unadulterated. Thus, nothing is worse than lacking constancy in conduct. *Lacking constancy* is like the *Analects* saying, “A man without steadfastness cannot be a shaman or a physician”—hence it is said to be detestable.

One may appraise horses yet fail to recognize a horse—*fail* means not to know. Yet the fine horse remains within the appraisal. A fine horse may live long or die young; its bone structure cannot be appraised. Not knowing, it is said to remain within the appraisal.

When people set fires, some carry flames to feed the blaze, others fetch water to quench it—both achieve nothing, yet the resentment and virtue between them are far apart.

A man of Ying sought a roof beam, desiring timber three spans in girth. Ying was the capital of Chu, located north of present-day Jiangling. *Beam* refers to the ridgepole. Yet he was offered a chariot hub; kneeling, he measured it. Though its girth sufficed, its length was inadequate. *Girth* means size; *length inadequate* means it was too short.

Qubo Yu transformed through virtue. Qubo Yu was Qu Ao, a grandee of Wei. When Viscount Jian of Zhao was about to attack Wei, he sent Shi Mo to observe it. Shi Mo said, “Qubo Yu governs—you cannot send troops against them.” Hence it is said he transformed through virtue.

Gongsun Yang ruled through punishment and guilt—their ends were the same. Gongsun Yang was the son of Lord Shuzuo of Wei. Fleeing from Wei to Qin, he served Duke Xiao as minister, establishing laws of mutual responsibility—hence it is said he ruled through punishment and guilt.

The state of Qin enfeoffed him as Lord of Shang, hence he was called Shang Yang. Shang lies southeast of Jingzhao. Yu transformed through virtue, while Yang ruled through punishment—yet their ends were the same.

The ailing lie upon bedding. *Lie* means to recline; *bedding* refers to the mat. The physician employs needles and stone probes, while the shaman uses sacrificial grains and reeds—both seek to save in equal measure. *Physician* denotes the master healer. Male shamans are called *xi*; female shamans, *wu*. Stone needles are whetted to lance abscesses, draining foul blood. *Sacrificial grains* are polished rice offered to spirits; *reeds* are rushes. All serve to cure illness and seek blessings—hence it is said they save in equal measure.

The head of a leopard-cat cures rat bites; the seed of the foxnut heals scrofula. When rats gnaw a person’s wound, the leopard-cat remedies it. *Scrofula* is a swelling of the neck. *Foxnut* is the aquatic *qian*, called *yantou* in Youzhou—it too effects a cure. Horseflies disperse congealed blood; hewing wood relieves tooth decay—these are instances of extending the principle. *Extending* means applying.

Grease kills turtles; magpie droppings strike hedgehogs—*strike* also means to kill. Rotten ash breeds maggots; lacquer fails to dry when exposed to crab—these are instances where the principle does not extend. *Rotten* means decayed; *dry* means to harden.

Whether extending or not extending, there are cases of seeming falsehood that are true, and seeming truth that is false—who can fathom their subtleties? The world holds no pure-white fox, yet there are pure-white fox-fur robes, woven from many white pelts.

The adept learner is like the King of Qi eating chicken: he must consume the feet, dozens of them, before he is sated. *Feet* refers to the chicken’s talons. This illustrates that in seeking the Dao, one gathers from many sources before attaining sufficiency.

A knife may shave hair, but to fell a great tree, only an axe will suffice. *Suffice* means to sever. Thus, things inherently possess means by which the lesser may succeed where the greater falls short.

Gazing at a square inch of an ox, one does not perceive its size compared to a sheep; only by surveying the whole body does one grasp the vastness of the difference. *Vast* here implies multiplicity.

A pregnant woman who sees a hare may bear a child with a cleft chest; one who sees a elk may give birth to a child with four eyes. A small horse with large eyes cannot be called a large horse; a large horse with small eyes is termed a "small-eyed horse." Things inherently possess semblances that are yet not so.

Thus, severing a finger may lead to death, while severing an arm may preserve life—*sever* means to wound. The outcome cannot be invariably deduced. One tempers a sharp sword with a soft whetstone—*soft* means moist. One strikes bells and chimes with a dampened mallet; a sturdy hub requires supple spokes. Two rigid things cannot harmonize; two strong things cannot submit to one another.

Therefore, the catalpa splits the horn, and the *mali* cuts jade—this speaks of the soft overcoming the hard. A deceiver does not study deceit but succeeds through it and thus breeds distrust—*deceiver* means one who feigns. A brawler does not study contention but stands firm in it and thus fosters no yielding.

Thus, the noble person does not enter prison, for it wounds benevolence, nor the marketplace, for it shames integrity—*shames* means to disgrace. Accumulation cannot be treated without caution.

One does not run with bound hands, for bound hands cannot run swiftly; one does not fly with a bent tail, for a bent tail cannot fly far. That which is used must rely on that which is not used.

Thus, that which enables sight is itself unseen; that which makes the drum sound is itself silent—*silent* means without sound. Tasting a single morsel of meat reveals the flavor of the entire cauldron—*cauldron* refers to a vessel with feet, while *pot* has none. Hanging a feather and charcoal together reveals the qi of dryness and dampness—dryness makes the charcoal light, dampness makes it heavy.

By a small sign, one sees a single leaf fall and knows the year is drawing to a close; one glimpses ice in a jar and knows the world’s cold. From the near, one infers the far—*infers* means to know.

Three men walking abreast cannot pass through a single door—for the door cannot accommodate them. One man following another may traverse the entire world. This speaks of non-concurrency.

Feet press the earth to leave tracks; swift movement in sunlight casts shadows—this is easy yet difficult. *Press* means to tread. Treading the earth, tracks form of themselves; walking at midday, shadows arise of themselves—this is the easy part. To make the tracks straight and the shadows upright—this is the difficult part.

King Zhuang executed Li Shi, while Sunshu Ao prepared his cap and washed his robes. *Li Shi* was a sycophantic minister. Hating the wicked man’s death, Sunshu Ao knew he would soon be employed, so he prepared his cap and washed his robes.

Duke Wen discarded his wormwood mat, which had grown moldy and black. Jiu Fan resigned and left, saying: "I have followed you through your wanderings, and my faults are many. If even I am aware of them, how much more must you be? I beg to take my leave now." Thus, he *resigned and left*.

Thus, when mulberry leaves fall, the aged grow sorrowful. As the mulberry leaves wither and scatter, the elderly fear their lives are nearing their end, and so they are moved to sorrow.

A small tripod is used daily yet not esteemed, for though it is seen every day, it cannot harmonize the five flavors. A Zhou tripod is never heated yet cannot be disdained, for though the great Zhou tripod is not used daily for cooking, it can harmonize flavors. Thus, some things are valuable precisely because they are not used. *Not used* refers to the tripod not being heated; *valuable* refers to its role in harmonizing the five flavors.

When the ground is level, water does not flow; when weights are balanced, the scale does not tilt. *Flow* means to move; *tilt* means to incline. That which is extreme must have something to which it responds. *Extreme* means excess. Light and heavy strike and counterbalance each other, so it is said that there must be something to which it responds. *Responds* means to move. Thus, some things have their greatest use precisely in not being used. The scale weighs things, yet it is not the things themselves that are used—only by using the scale does one know their weight. Thus, it is said that not being used is its great use.

Bathing before undressing is acceptable; undressing before bathing is not. Offering sacrifices before the feast is proper—ritual dictates that one must first offer food in sacrifice to show precedence. *Feast* means to eat. Feasting before offering sacrifices is improper, for it is disrespectful. Thus, it is said to be unacceptable. The sequence of things has its proper order.

On the day of sacrifice, to speak of dogs giving birth; on the evening of taking a wife, to speak of mourning garments; on the day of setting out wine, to speak of visiting graves—all are improper.

To invoke the past when crossing the Yangtze or Yellow River—*the waves of Yang Hou*. The Marquis of Yangling drowned, and his spirit could raise great waves to harm people, hence the name *the waves of Yang Hou*. Boatmen do not wish to speak of it.

Some say: knowing a pardon is imminent and killing many is unbenevolent. Others say: knowing a pardon is imminent and sparing many makes one a benevolent person. Their hope for pardon is the same, but the harm or benefit differs. Thus, some blow on fire to kindle it, while others blow on fire to extinguish it—the difference lies in how they blow.

To feast one’s village by slaughtering an ox, yet curse the mother of one’s eastern neighbor—failing to repay virtue while bringing peril upon oneself. *Peril* means harm.

King Wen’s sunken chest and Bao Shen’s hunched back contributed to the governance of the state of Chu. *King Wen* was the son of King Wu of Chu. *Xiong Ci* had a sunken chest. *Bao Shen* was a minister of Chu. *Hunched back* means bent. *Contributed to governance* means they were worthy.

Bi Chen left the city and gained insight, thereby aiding Zichan’s affairs. *Bi Chen* was a grandee of Zheng. Planning in the wilds succeeded; planning within the state failed. When Zheng faced difficulties, Zichan took him into the countryside to discuss matters with the four neighboring states. Thus, it is said he aided Zichan’s affairs. The *Analects* states: "Bi Chen drafted the plans, Shishu deliberated on them, and Dongli Zichan refined them."

A dwarf’s doorway is higher than a tall man’s gate. The tall man said, "I do not know." The dwarf replied, "Though you do not know, you are still closer to it than I am." Thus, in all inquiries, one must ask those who are near.

When bandits approached, the lame man warned the blind man, and the blind man carried him to flee—both survived, each employing their abilities. Had the blind man been made to speak and the lame man to run, they would have lost their proper roles.

A man of Ying sought to sell his mother. He pleaded with the buyer, saying: "This mother is old. I beg you to feed her well and not make her suffer." *Ying* was the capital of Chu. *Sell* means to offer for sale. *Feed* means to care for.

This is an act of great unrighteousness, yet one seeks to perform minor righteousness.

The movements of armored creatures are for defense—such as turtles and crabs. *Movement* means action. The movements of chaste insects are for stinging—such as wasps and mud-daubers. *Chaste* means lacking male-female union. Having venom, they can sting. *[螫] is read as the "release" in "explanation."*

The movements of bears are for seizing and grappling. *Seizing* means to snatch. Bears are strong, so they can snatch and grapple. The movements of rhinoceroses and oxen are for butting. *Rhinoceros* is a horned beast. *Ox* refers to the plow-ox. No creature employs its strengths while using its weaknesses. *Employs* means to apply.

Governing a state is like weeding a field—one removes only what harms the seedlings. Now, one who washes their hair loses strands yet continues without cease, for what is removed is little, and what benefits is much.

A whetstone may be dull yet can sharpen metal—*metal* refers to blades and swords. A bow-rest may be crooked yet can straighten a bow—*rest* is the frame that holds a bow. Read as *qíng*.

Indeed, some things are crooked yet can straighten, dull yet can sharpen. The crooked is the rest, the straight is the bow; the dull is the whetstone, the sharp is the metal.

Strength values evenness, wisdom values swiftness. When attainment is equal, speed is superior. *Evenness* is read as *jī* (as in "minced"). Both *evenness* and *swiftness* imply quickness. When victory is equal, slowness is inferior.

The value of the *Mo Ye* sword lies in its responsiveness to things and its cutting edge. *Cut* means to sever. If the door-bar is not released, the ox-cart’s axle will snap. *Bar* means to latch. The people of Chu call the latch that breaks the axle when a cart passes over it.

Mencius said, "The ruts at the city gate are not made by the strength of two horses." *Axle* is read near *lán*. It must be pronounced with a quick tongue to be correct.

To abandon the Six Arts because Confucius was stranded in Chen and Cai would be delusion—*Six Arts* are ritual, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics. For a physician to be unable to treat their own illness, to be sick yet refuse medicine, would be recklessness. *Recklessness* means acting without discernment.

*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll Twenty-Three concludes.
*Huainanzi Honglie Jie*, Scroll Twenty-Four.

The Grand Commandant and Libationer, your servant Xu Shen, respectfully records:

*Shuolin Xun* – Trees growing in clusters are called a *forest*. It explains how the myriad things rely on abundance, gathering like a forest, hence the title *Shuolin*, which is used to name this chapter.

Governing the world by the measures of a single age is like a traveler on a boat who drops his sword in midstream and hastily carves a mark on the mast—*carve* means to notch. *Mast* refers to the side planks of the ship. The sword fell into the current, and he carved the side of the boat, saying that the sword was lost beneath this mark. *Mast* is pronounced like *Fan* in the *Zuozhuan*, where King Xiang of Zhou resided in Fan of Zheng. Seeking it at dusk when the boat nears the shore, he looks only where he carved the mark—his ignorance of the nature of things is extreme. Following the traces of a single corner without knowing how to roam through heaven and earth, no delusion is greater. Though there may be occasional coincidences, they are not to be valued. It is like the clay dragons of drought years or the straw effigies of pestilence—these are what rulers rely on. Clay dragons are used to pray for rain, and straw dogs to seek blessings; they are valued at times. The Cao clan’s torn cloth is prized by those with boils, yet it is not the jade *huang* of the Xia dynasty. The people of Chu call cloth *Cao*; today, common folk tie the first woven cloth to its side, calling it *Cao cloth*. Burning it to treat boils brings healing, so those with boils value it. A half-wall is called a *huang*; the *huang* summons the masses and is a treasure of the state, hence it is said it is not the *huang* of the Xia dynasty.

Without past or present, without beginning or end, it gave birth to heaven and earth before heaven and earth existed—profound, subtle, vast, and great. To say it is profound, subtle, vast, and great is to say it can give birth to heaven and earth. That which relies on [stepping] is shallow; yet it awaits what it does not tread to proceed—*stepping* means to tread. What relies on treading to proceed cannot proceed, hence it is said to await what it does not tread before proceeding. What wisdom knows is narrow; yet it awaits what it does not know to become enlightened. *Narrow* means limited. Knowing what is known and what is not known completes enlightenment.

Swimmers stumble with their feet and flail with their hands, failing to grasp the method, stumbling and failing all the more—*failing* means sinking. Only when one can truly swim does it no longer depend on hands and feet. Birds fly back to their homeland, rabbits run to their burrows, foxes die with their heads toward the hills, and cold birds soar over water—each mourns its origin. *Cold birds* are waterfowl. *Mourn* means to grieve.

Do not give a mirror to the blind, nor shoes to the lame, nor bestow *zhangfu* caps upon the Yue people—these are not for their use. *Bestow* means to give. *Zhangfu* is a cap. The Yue people cut their hair and have no use for caps. A hammer with a hundred handles cannot drive itself; eyes that see a hundred paces away cannot see their own eyelashes. This illustrates that people can do things for others but not for themselves. Dogs and pigs do not choose their bowls and jars when eating, fattening their bodies while nearing death—*fatten* means to take. *Nearing* means drawing close. Once fattened, they are cooked, hence they near death. The phoenix soars high above a thousand *ren*, so none can reach it. A *ren* is seven feet; without a sage ruler of virtue, it cannot be summoned, hence it is said none can reach it.

The moon illuminates the world yet is eclipsed by the *zhan zhu*; the flying serpent glides through mist yet is endangered by the *ji qu*. *Zhan zhu* is the toad in the moon that eats the moon, hence it is said to be eclipsed by the *zhan zhu*. *Endangered* means to fear. *Ji qu* is the cricket; the *Erya* calls it the *qinglie* with a large belly. When the upper serpent sees it, the serpent does not dare move, hence it is said to be endangered by the *ji qu*. The crow’s strength surpasses the sun, yet it submits to the *zhui li*—this shows the limits of its power. Crows appear in daylight, hence it is said they surpass the sun. *Submits* means to fear. *Zhui li*, according to the *Erya*, is the *bili*; the people of Qin call it *sishi*. When a bird crows at dawn during the silkworm season, the great birds all fear it—hence it is said to show the limits of its power.

Nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Peng Zu is considered short-lived. Life is a sojourn; death is a return. The child who dies young departs from its sojourn and returns to its destined place, hence is considered long-lived. Peng Zu was an ancestor of Chu, living four hundred years; not returning early, he is considered short-lived. The *Analects* says, "I privately compare myself to Old Peng." This likely refers to him. Another account says Peng Zu was a student of immortality in the time of the Yellow Emperor, implying he did not return to the spirit early enough.

A short rope cannot draw from deep waters; a small vessel cannot hold great things—these are not their proper tasks. *Task* is read like the *ren* in *burden*. Anger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. Non-anger is true anger; non-action is true action. Seeing the formless, one attains what is seen; hearing the soundless, one attains what is heard—this means all things are easily cared for when soundless, hence one attains what is heard. The highest flavor is not satisfying; the highest words are not ornate; the highest joy does not laugh; the highest sound does not clamor; the great craftsman does not carve; the great vessel is not adorned; the great warrior does not fight—*satisfying* means gratifying. *Clamor* means shouting. *Not carve* means not carving itself. *Vessel* refers to the implements of *fu*, *fu*, *bian*, and *dou*. The great warrior is feared upon hearing of him, so he no longer fights.

Attaining the Dao, virtue follows. It is like the yellow bell harmonizing with the *gong* note or the great *cu* harmonizing with the *shang*—no further tuning is needed.

"More" means change. One who tempers with clay remains whole; one who tempers with metal stumbles; one who tempers with jade shatters. *Temper* (鉒) is read like the *zhu* in "bronze pillar" (金之铜柱余之鉒). *Zhu* means to lift a horse—Lu household calls it *tou pian*. *Metal* refers to the golden step-guard. *Stumbles* means to trip and flee. *Shatters* means swift and sudden, read like the *fa* in "shooting a hundred arrows" (射百发之发). Thus, what is valued externally hollows what lies within. *Valued* refers to gold and jade. *Hollows* means qi becomes unsettled and inauspicious.

The hunter pursuing game does not see Mount Tai—he sees only the beast. When desires lie without, clarity is obscured. *Obscured* means seeing only the benefit of things, not their harm.

He who listens to sounds with sound is deaf; he who listens to soundless sound is keen. Neither deaf nor keen, he communes with spirit-light.

The diviner grasps the tortoise; the augur aligns the stalks, consulting the numbers—yet where lies the true question? *Stalks* are the forty-nine stalks. They may divine fortune or misfortune, may consult the numbers. *Numbers* refer to those who seek divination.

Dancers raise their joints; sitters, without prior agreement, all clap as one—what they reach is the same.

The sun rises from Tang Valley and sets in Yu Abyss. None perceive its motion, yet in an instant it bows to the nape of man. *Bows* means to bend.

No one wishes to learn dragon-riding, yet all wish to learn horse-riding; no one wishes to learn ghost-governance, yet all wish to learn human governance—what is urgently needed is pursued. Dragon-riding and ghost-governance bring no benefit to worldly use, thus horse-riding and human governance become urgent tasks.

Dismantling a gate to use as firewood, blocking a well to make a mortar—human endeavors sometimes resemble one another. *Sometimes* means there are instances. *Resemble* means resembling folly.

Water and fire hate each other, yet the *wei* sits between them, harmonizing the five flavors. *Wei* is a small cauldron. Another saying: a cauldron without ears is called *wei*. *Wei* is read like *hui* in "brightness" (日慧). The *wei* holds water while fire cooks it—thus it is said to sit between them.

Bone and flesh love each other, yet slander and treachery divide them, endangering father and son. Such were King Ping of Chu and Duke Xian of Jin.

That which nourishes yet harms what it nourishes is like cutting the foot to fit the shoe or severing the head to suit the hat. *Nourishes* alludes to slander and treachery. *Harms what it nourishes* alludes to bone and flesh. *Severing* also refers to the shoe. The head is large, the hat small—they do not suit. To cut or pare the head to fit the hat is folly. *Severing the head* may also be written as *ze*.

The *chang* plant drives away lice yet invites *qin qiong*—*chang* is sweet flag. *Qin qiong* is the earwig, an ear-infesting insect. Removing a small harm invites a greater calamity—thus small gratification harms great benefit.

A crumbling wall is worse than none, for it may collapse onto the roof. *Worse than none* means it would be better without the wall. *Collapse onto the roof* means the ruined house; the wall’s decay returns it to earth, its origin—thus it is said to collapse onto the roof.

The jade bi and ai become vessels through the work of *jian zhu*—*jian zhu* is the stone that polishes jade. The *Book of Songs* says, "Stones from other mountains may serve as whetstones." *Jian* is read like *lian* in the surname Lian. The *Mo Ye* sword cuts through all, honed by grinding and sharpening. *Honed* also means effort—*interwoven* patterns.

When the cunning hare is caught, the hunting hound is boiled; when the high bird is slain, the strong crossbow is stored away. *Boiled* means killed; *stored* means discarded—implying they are no longer used.

The *tuo* and the steed travel a thousand li without flying, hunger without provisions of grain. A fire breaks out and rain falls—fire is misfortune, rain is fortune. Thus, within calamity lies blessing.

The coffin-seller desires the people’s illness; the grain-hoarder desires years of famine. *Famine* means great hunger, when grain does not ripen.

Still water is level; level, it becomes clear; clear, it reveals the forms of things, leaving nothing hidden—thus it may serve as a standard. *Hidden* means to escape.

When the river runs dry, the valley empties—*empties* means without water. When the hill is leveled, the abyss fills—*leveled* means flattened; *fills* means full. When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold.

The depth of the Yellow River lies in its banks, which stand in the mountains—this is no matter of a single morning or evening.

A bolt of fine white silk: one end makes a cap, the other a shoe. The cap is worn upon the head, the shoe □ upon the foot.

Those who know themselves cannot be lured by things—things cannot move them. Those who understand life and death cannot be deterred by peril—peril cannot frighten them. Thus, the skilled swimmer cannot be daunted by fording. Fording, he cannot drown.

No bond is closer than that of flesh and blood, for the limbs and kin are linked as one. *Flesh and blood* refers to the body itself; hence it is said the limbs and kin are connected. When the heart loses its restraint, it turns to self-harm—this means that when the heart loses its discipline, it harms the body. How much more so for those distant and estranged? *Distant and estranged* refers to others.

The sage’s relation to the Dao is like the sunflower’s to the sun: though it cannot remain with it from beginning to end, its turning toward it is sincere. *Turning* means facing; *sincere* means true.

When palace pools overflow with rain, they flood; in drought, they dry. *Overflow* means heavy rain. The source of the Yangtze’s waters cannot be exhausted by deep springs. *Exhausted* means depleted.

Surely not the rafters alone can block the sun, nor the wheel’s spokes alone pursue speed—yet rafters and spokes are not to be relied upon. Metal overcomes wood not by a single blade felling a forest; earth overcomes water not by a single clod damming a river.

The lame man sees a tiger and does not flee—not from courage, but because his position is unfavorable. What is tilted is easily overturned; what leans is easily toppled. *Tilted* means near to falling; *toppled* is read as *fǔ* in *fǔjì* (toppling aid). *Near* means close. Dampness invites rain.

The mousetrap snaps when triggered; the fisherman’s float bobs when the line is cast. *Triggered* means sprung, and the mouse is caught. *Bobbing* means the float moves. *Moves* means the fish is hooked. *Task* refers to the carrying-pole, as in the *Book of Songs*: “We bear our burdens.”

The straw dog can stand but cannot walk; snake-bed resembles *ligusticum* but cannot be fragrant. *Snake-bed* is foul; *ligusticum* is sweet.

It is said that Xu You had no virtue, nor Wu Huo strength—yet both showed displeasure in their countenance. *Displeasure* means anger; another says shame. People are never stirred except by what they lack. *Stirred* means roused.

If a hare’s speed were as great as a horse’s, it would outrun the wind. *Outrun the wind* speaks of its swiftness. Yet if it were a horse, it could not run at all.

Winter may bring thunder and lightning, summer frost and snow—yet the power of cold and heat remains unchanged; small changes do not alter the great order.

The Yellow Emperor gave birth to yin and yang. The Yellow Emperor is the ancient celestial spirit who, at the dawn of human creation, brought forth yin and yang. Shang Pian gave rise to ears and eyes; Sang Lin gave rise to arms and hands. *Shang Pian* and *Sang Lin* are names of spirits. This is how Nü Wa achieved her seventy transformations. Nü Wa was a ruler of the world who, through seventy changes, shaped creation—just as Yu’s governance of the world was not the work of one man alone.

One may speak all day of sagely deeds, and among a hundred shots, some will surely display the skill of Yi or Peng Meng. Yet the world does not acknowledge them, for their adherence to discipline is not genuine. *Not genuine* means not truly so.

The bones of an ox’s hoof or a pig’s skull are still bones, yet the world does not divine with them. It must inquire of the tortoise about fortune and misfortune, for the tortoise has endured many years. Those near Ao Granary do not eat more for its abundance; those beside the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers do not drink more for their vastness—they fill their bellies and no more. *Ao Granary* was an ancient ever-full granary, located north of Rongyang.

Orchids and angelica are fragrant, yet they have never seen frost. The owl wards off weapons, and its lifespan ends at the full moon of the fifth month. *Owl* likely refers to the *xiao* (screech owl); another says the toad. In later times, people made effigies of the *xiao* or toad to burn at the full moon of the fifth month, saying such things are not fit for use.

Between the tongue and the teeth, which wears away first? *Wears away* means to be ground down. Between the butt-spike and the blade, which fails first? *Butt-spike* is the bronze ferrule at the base of a lance. The butt-spike does not decay, yet the blade rusts first. *Butt-spike* is read as *dùn* in *dǔnshǒu* (to bow the head).

Between the plumb line and the arrow, which is straighter? *Arrow* means the shaft. Now, the eel and the snake, the silkworm and the candle—their forms are similar, yet affection and aversion differ. People love the eel and the silkworm but fear the snake and the candle; hence it is said they differ.

Jin used the jade of Chuiji to gain Yu and Guo—this is explained in the *Qi Su* chapter. The Li Rong destroyed the state of Jin with a beautiful woman. *Beautiful woman* refers to Li Ji. *Destroyed* means to bring chaos.

The deaf do not sing, for they have no way to delight themselves; the blind do not gaze, for they have no way to perceive things. *Perceive* means to see.

Those who watch archery forget their skill; *skill* means craft. Those who read books forget their love—when the mind is fixed on one thing, it forgets what it once held dear.

What was done in ancient times cannot be changed: thus, the handcart remains to this day without a *chanju*. *Chanju* is a type of vehicle, read like *jué* in *juéxiàng* from the phrase “Confucius shot at the Juéxiang clan.”

If one merely blows the *yu*, and the Shi clan fills the holes, though the notes are in tune, they cannot be heard. *Merely* refers to an ancient person who did not know how to play; *merely* is read like *wúyán* in *Yan wúyánchú*. It lacks the form of a ruler. *Ruler* means the master of office.

To treat the same ailment as the dead is difficult for a skilled physician;
to follow the same path as a fallen kingdom makes counsel impossible.

*Counsel* may also be read as *yù* (preparation).

To prepare food as a guest while eating only *líhé* oneself—
one’s reputation exceeds reality.
*Reputation* means weight.
To bear the name of *rén* and *yì* (benevolence and righteousness)
is heavier than the reality of preparing food.

A nursing puppy snapping at a tiger,
a crouching hen striking a weasel—
favor bestowed does not measure their strength.

To bend the *yǐng* (shadow) is to shape the form;
when the form bends, the shadow bends.
To muddy the *yìng* (echo) is to corrupt the sound;
when the sound is muddied, the echo is muddied.

One whose emotions leak is easily fathomed.
If desires are not restrained and spill outward,
then the heart’s depths are known.

Flowers out of season are inedible.
*Flowers* means fruit.
Like eating late melons in the eighth or ninth month,
which causes malaria—
this is why it is said to be inedible.
It illustrates that excessive speech, untimely and misplaced,
should not be heeded.

The *zhí* (ultimate) of *zhíyuè* (crossing) comes by boat or by cart;
though paths differ, the destination is one.
*Zhí* means to reach.
*Extreme* also means to reach.

(Play on characters: *hù* #6, *wén* ear → *hùwén* mutual.)

Though beautiful women differ in physique and fair ones in face,
all please the eye.
*Beautiful* and *fair* are synonymous.
Though pear, orange, date, and chestnut differ in taste,
all harmonize the palate.
*Harmonize* means to suit.

There may be thieves among the wealthy, though wealth does not guarantee theft;
there may be the virtuous among the poor, though poverty does not guarantee integrity.

The *shāngmiáo* (hemp plant) resembles cotton but cannot be spun into it.
The *zhènmiáo* (reed sprout), called *dí* in Chu,
*dí* read as in *dízhàn* (enemy in battle).
Yan and You call it *dídiǎo*.

The *zhī* (hemp with seed) does not resemble cloth but can be made into it.
*Zhī* is read as in *fēi* from the *Zuǒzhuàn* (left-hand record) phrase *“fēi bù wéi zāi”* (the swarm does not bring disaster).

Those who emerge from the forest cannot walk straight paths;
those who tread perilous ground cannot follow the plumb line.
*The plumb line* is also a straight path.

What enables *Yì* (the archer) to strike distant and minute targets
is not the bow and arrows;
what enables *Zàofù* (the charioteer) to overtake swift steeds and travel far
is not the bit and bridle.

The sea’s bounty is contained within it, hence its vastness;
thunder and rain arise from the sea, then return through valleys—
thus, it is said to contain its own source.

The wheel returns to its path, hence its endurance.
*Its path* means unceasing rotation.

Sheep’s flesh does not covet ants, yet ants are drawn to sheep’s flesh—
for it is rank with *shān* (gamey qi).

*Sōng* (pickled fish) and *suān* (sour sauce) do not covet gnats,
yet gnats are drawn to *sōng* and *suān*.

Taste a single slice of meat and know the flavor of the whole pot;
hang a feather beside a charcoal and discern the qi of dryness and dampness—
thus, the small reveals the great, the near suggests the far.

A reservoir of ten *qǐng* can irrigate forty *qǐng*,
for a reservoir stores water—*pí*.
Yet a reservoir of one *qǐng* can irrigate four *qǐng*—
the great and small differ in proportion.

The light of the bright moon can be seen from afar,
yet it cannot be used for fine calligraphy;
on a dense foggy morning, one can write fine calligraphy,
yet cannot see beyond the ordinary.

A painter who meticulously renders every hair loses the likeness;
who focuses on every minute hair, dwelling on the small,
loses the overall form.

An archer who aims at the small misses the large—
who sights only the small and shoots accordingly,
thus strikes true.

Each matter has its proper measure.

Plugging a rat’s hole ruins the neighborhood;
dabbing a small pustule spreads a carbuncle—
*pāo*, a facial *qi* eruption.
*Zé-jū*, a festering boil.

Like a pearl with its blemish, jade with its flaw—
leave them be and they remain whole;
remove them and they are diminished.

The bramble’s nest dwells where the forest thrives—
that is ease;
the hollow’s den takes shelter in the cliff’s embrace—
that is convenience.

The cliff’s rampart, a high barrier against flood.

King Zicheng’s son, Regui, trod upon deer and wild ox,
grappling with tiger and rhinoceros,
yet when confined in the dark chamber,
he could not wrestle with tortoise and turtle—
his strength was ill-suited.

Regui was the son of King Liao of Wu.

Tang expelled his lord and earned honor’s name—
Tang, the thirteenth descendant of King Gui,
son of Yi, whose given name was Wu.
To "expel his lord" means to subdue Jie.
He removed the people’s harm,
thus earning honor’s name.

Cui Zhu assassinated his ruler and incurred great blame—
Cui Zhu, son of the great minister Cui Ye of Qi,
who killed Duke Zhao of Qi.

Their methods were the same in purpose,
yet their means were different.
Their purpose was the same, but their actions diverged—
Tang slew his lord to benefit the people,
while Cui Zhu acted for his own gain—
thus they differed.

Lü Wang made the aged strive—
Lü Wang wielded his knife and fished with hook,
yet at seventy he first learned to read,
and at ninety became King Wen’s teacher,
aiding King Wu in conquering Jie.
King Cheng then enfeoffed him in Qi,
so the aged emulated him and strove with vigor.

Xiang Tuo made infants proud—
by kindred emulation.
Xiang Tuo, at seven, impoverished Confucius
and became his teacher,
thus making the lowly presume greatness.

He made leaves fall by stirring the wind,
made waters muddy by agitating the fish.

The tiger’s and leopard’s markings drew hunters—
their patterns lured the archer’s aim.
The monkey’s swiftness brought the snare—
its agility summoned the hunter’s strike.

A single chess move reveals not wisdom,
a single string’s pluck reveals not sorrow.

A three-inch flute cannot fill the world,
yet a ten-stone measure suffices—
a hundred dou is enough.
To gauge the river with a pole,
then measure the water’s depth—
this is folly.
The pole sinks, yet one takes the river’s depth as its end—
thus it is called folly.

The fisherman flees to the deep—
*Yu* as in the *Analects*.
The woodcutter flees to the mountain—
what is urgent is survival.

In the morning market, he runs;
at dusk, he walks past—
what is sought is lost.

The leopard’s pelt, though mixed, is not as pure as the fox’s.
A white jade with flaws is not a treasure—
*kao*, a blemish.

This speaks of purity’s difficulty.

The ghosts of soldiers slain in battle despise and fear shamans—
the ghosts, skilled in ailing the living,
while shamans can curse and slay them.
*Despise*—they fear them.

The bandits’ pack howls like a vile dog—
*chou*, like *wu* (evil).

A village without a shrine easily offers millet and meat,
a land without a state easily seeks blessings.
Without sacrifice, no prayer to the gods,
yet prayers are still made—
thus millet and meat are easily given,
blessings easily sought.

The turtle has no ears,
yet its eyes cannot blink—
its sight is keen.
If it cannot blink, then blinking reveals it.
The blind man has no eyes,
yet his ears cannot discern—
his hearing is acute.
If they cannot discern, then probing reveals sound.

A posthumous child does not think of his father—
his likeness is not in the heart.
He does not know his father’s face,
does not dream of his likeness—
his form is not in the eyes.
The eyes never saw the likeness,
thus it is said his form is not in the eyes.

The viper cannot be made into a foot—
its venom is deadly.
The tiger and leopard cannot be made to climb trees—
they are fierce beasts, unsuited to scaling wood.

The horse does not eat fat,
the green pheasant does not peck millet—
this is not from virtue.
The green pheasant is the green swallow.
The horse does not steal fat.

When Qin opened the Heng Pass,
Wei fortified its city.
Wei moved its capital to Daliang,
hearing Qin had repaired the Heng Pass,
knowing they would come east to conquer—
thus they built the city and set defenses.

A hungry horse in the stable stands silent,
but when hay is tossed beside it,
contention arises.

To draw the bow and shoot—
without the string, the arrow cannot fly.
*Draw*—to pull taut.
*Fly*—to send forth.
The string’s role in shooting is but one percent.

Dao and virtue can endure,
but expedience cannot—
thus fleeing through the pass cannot be undone,
and the escaped convict cannot return.
*Flee*—to escape.
Prisoners often escape through passes and wilds,
yet cannot re-enter—
thus expedience is not constant.

A ring can illustrate a circle,
but not a wheel.
A sash can be twisted into a belt,
yet need not be taught.
*Teach*—also *belt*, winding and turning.

The sun and moon do not rise together,
the fox has but one master,
the divine dragon does not mate,
the fierce beast does not gather in groups,
the raptor does not fly in pairs.
Measure by the plumb line and it will not stray,
weigh by the balance and it will not err.
The balance—*cheng*.
Plant the marker and gaze—you will not be misled.

Diminish the years and suspicion falls on the younger brother,
increase them and doubt falls on the elder—
better to follow its nature,
as it ought to be.
*Nature*—Dao.
*Ought*—also *real*.

Men do not see the dragon’s flight,
yet when it rises, it soars high—
wind and rain aid it.

A multitude of woodworms will snap the tree,
a great gap will crumble the wall.

Things that hang may sometimes fall—
*hui*, to drop.
Things that lean may sometimes slacken—
*chi*, to loosen.

What endures the frost without dying
loses not its due.
To die is to lose its due—
not dying, thus it is said it loses not its due.

What endures the heat without exhaustion
loses not its due—
*wang*, also *lose*.

The untested loses its proper use.
*Wang*, also *lose*—*wu*, without.
What is said: "If not frozen nor exhausted by heat, what proper use is there?"

Boiling water and bathing utensils prepared, yet lice and fleas mourn each other—
a grand hall completed, yet swallows and sparrows rejoice within—
*you*, sorrow.
Sorrow and joy are distinct.

Gao Xia Hui sees the *yi* [congee], and says, "It can nourish the aged"—
Sun Zhu sees the *yi*, and says, "It can glue doorways"—
the same object seen, yet their purposes differ.

Gao Xia Hui, son of the Duke of Lu, Xian Wuji, named Huò, styled *Qin*.
His home had a great willow tree; his virtue was such that he was called Gao Xia Hui.
Another says: Gao Xia, a village.

*Mu*, doorways and keys.
Silkworms eat but do not drink, and in twenty-two days they transform—
cicadas drink but do not eat, and in thirty days they molt—
the *yǒu yú* [larvae of cicadas or dragonflies] neither eat nor drink,
and in three days they perish.

Men eat *liàn* [poisonous plants] and *shí* [stones] and die,
yet silkworms eat them and are not hungry—
fish eat *bā shū* [a type of poisonous bean] and die,
yet rats eat them and grow fat.

Kinds cannot be relied upon to follow.
*Tui*, also *know*—*zhī*, also *know*.

瓦由火烧成，却不能从中获取火；
竹生于水中，却不能从中取得水。
瓦遇火则碎，竹遇水浸则死。
杨堁以遮尘，披裘以翣翼，岂如适衣之简便哉。
堁，土尘。 楚人称其为堁。

为酿酒者之利而不售酒，则竭；
为造车者之利而不租车，则不达。
握火提人，反先自热。
皆一介之人物，思自守者，不欲使酒人车人得利，
不售酒租车而先自竭，先不达，犹以火援人，先自热（自）烂。

邻母死往哭之，妻死而不泣，有所劫迫之。
嫌犹哀，嫌於情色，故曰有所劫迫。

有以饭死者而禁天下之食，有以车为败者禁天下之乘，则悖矣。
申生雉经，晋不绝绳。
子胥自沉，昊不断水也。

钓者静之，□者扣舟；
罩者抑之，挂者举之；

□者以柴积水中，以取鱼。
扣，击。
鱼闻击舟声，藏柴下，壅而取之。
□，读沙糁。
今兖州人积柴水搏鱼为□。
幽州名之为涔也。

见象牙乃知其大於牛，见虎尾而知其大於狸，
一节见而百节知也。
吴伐越，至会稽，独获骨节专车。
见一节大，余节不得小，故曰百节知。

小国不斗於大国之间，长见嫌也。

头中风，空木瑟，其音同，其实则异也。

日月欲明而浮云盖之，

「Tigers, though they have cubs, if the latter cannot pounce or grasp, they are often killed by their parents, as a sign of **discarding their martial prowess** (*堕武*).
**Discarding** (*堕*) means **abandoning or ruining**; **martial prowess** (*武*) is **the manifestation of their might** (*威*).

The **seal of a tortoise shell** (*龟纽之玺*), tied with a cord, is worn as an ornament by the virtuous.
The **seal of a tortoise shell** (*龟纽之玺*) is a **cloth badge**; **tied** (*纽*) means **fastened**; **ornament** (*佩*) means **to wear or adorn**.

When **fertile soil** (*土壤*) is spread across fields, those who can cultivate it see it as a source of wealth.
Those who can **move and till** (*能动者*) sow fine grains, thus **abundantly enriching** (*以为饶富*) themselves.

To rescue a drowning person, **common rope** (*寻常之缠索*) is more useful than gold or jade.
Though **gold and jade are treasures** (*金玉虽宝*), they are not tools for rescuing the drowning—thus, **they are not as useful as ordinary rope** (*故曰不如寻常之缠索*).

When examining a book, if the top page mentions **wine** (*酒*), then the bottom page will surely have **meat** (*肉*); if the top page mentions **years** (*年*), then the bottom page will surely have **months** (*月*).
One **infers the rest by analogy** (*以类而取之*).
**Analogy** (*类*) is akin to **context or pattern** (*事*).

To **blind oneself with dust** (*蒙尘而眯*) is natural—**this is its inherent tendency** (*固其理也*).
Yet to **force dust and blindness upon one who never leaves their home** (*为不出户而尘堁眯之*) is **against the Dao** (*非其道*).

Butchers **must walk** (*羹藿*) instead of riding in their carts,
those who **construct chariots** (*为车者*) **must walk** (*步行*) instead of riding them,
potters **must use rough clay vessels** (*□盆*) instead of refined ones,
carpenters **must work in narrow spaces** (*处狭卢*) instead of broad ones.
Those who **create** (*为者*) cannot **use** (*用*) their own creations,
while those who **use** (*用者*) would **not consent** (*弗肯为*) to the labor of creation.
The former **cannot use** because of **the pursuit of profit** (*以利动*),
the latter **would not consent** because of **the allure of wealth and honor** (*以富宠也*).

When the **wheel hub** (*毂*) stands upright, the **thirty spokes** (*三十辐*) each exert their strength without **harming one another** (*不得相害*).
If **one spoke alone were to bear the weight** (*一辐独入*), the rest would **be abandoned** (*众辐皆弃*)—
how could it **ever reach a thousand miles** (*岂能致千里哉*)?

Travelers at night **cover their eyes** (*掩目*) and **extend their hands** (*前其手*),
those crossing water **untether their horses** (*解其马*) and **load them onto boats** (*载之舟*).
Some matters are **fit for application** (*有所宜*), while others **should not be forced** (*有所不施*).

**Mandarins and bitter oranges** (*橘柚*) have their native regions,
**reeds and cattails** (*雚苇*) grow in clusters,
beasts with similar hooves **roam together** (*相从游*),
birds with matching wings **soar together** (*相从翔*).
**Things of the same kind naturally gather** (*以类聚也*).

The **excess water in a field** (*田中之潦*) flows into the sea,
while **whispered words** (*附耳之言*) are heard **a thousand miles away** (*闻於千里*).
**Whispered words** (*附耳之言*) are **private murmurs** (*近耳之言*), spoken close to the ear,
yet **known even at a thousand miles’ distance** (*千里知之*).

It is said: **If you wish no one to know, do not do it** (*欲人不知，莫如不为*).」

「Sū Qín’s *bù* (步) is slow and measured—*xúxíng* (徐行).
When asked *héfǒu* (何故), he replies *héfǒu* (何故).
His *qū* (趋) is questioned: *héqūchí* (何趋驰)? If there is purpose, then there will be debate; if there is much activity, then harshness will surely arise.
Sū Qín is a man of many schemes, so he is met with debate and harshness.

If the skin is not seen, how can the fur be spared?
If one fears the head and fears the tail, how many parts of the body remain?
If one fears the beginning and fears the end, yet does not fear the middle, how many parts remain?
This speaks of constant fear.

To survey the nine regions of land, one need not walk a thousand miles;
To lack the principles of governance and education, yet still aspire to rule over all the people, is difficult.
Without the proper methods, hence it is said to be difficult.

Those who are *dí dí* (旳旳) are captured, those who are *tí tí* (提提) are shot.
*Dí dí* (旳旳) means what is visible to all, hence capture.
*Tí tí* (提提) means stillness.
It is said: As if a bird does not fly, a beast does not run,
In stillness and quiet, one is shot by others.
Hence, great brilliance may be seen as shame,
Great virtue may be seen as insufficiency.

If shame, then one aligns oneself with the common people.
If insufficiency, then one’s true worth is like an empty facade.
Never having plowed and reaped to fill the granaries,
Never having tended mulberry and silk to fill the bags,
Yet acquiring wealth without righteous means,
And using it recklessly—*héng* (横).

*Héng* (横) means to act wantonly.
The sea does not accept the *rǔ* (胔) of unjust offerings,
And the Eastern Peak does not permit the unworthy to ascend.
The *rǔ* (胔) refers to the flesh of bones—unrighteous offerings.

If unrighteous offerings flow into the sea,
The sea god stirs and expels them, hence it does not accept them.
The Eastern Peak is the *Dōngyuè* (东岳).
Where the sovereign performs the *fēngshàn* (封禅) rites,
The unworthy are not allowed to ascend—only the worthy may ascend.

*Pángguāng* (旁光) does not rise to the sacrificial table.
*Pángguāng* (旁光) means the *bāo* (胞)—the auxiliary light.
Only the *zǔdòu* (俎豆) of pure offerings are accepted.
Though the shoulders and hips may be raised,
The ribs and sides cannot ascend to the table.

*Lièbó* (骝驳) does not enter the sacrificial pen.
The sacrificial beasts must be of pure color.

In the Central Plains, the *jié* (箑) is used for cutting,
Yet in winter, one does not know to withdraw it;
Wearing *qiàn yī* (褰衣) to wade through water,
Yet at the mound, one does not know to lower it;
This is not yet fit to respond to change.»

「There are mountains without forests, valleys without winds, and stones without gold.
Forests grow from mountains, yet not all mountains bear forests;
Winds emerge from valleys, yet not all valleys produce winds;
Gold is found in stones, yet not all stones contain gold.
This illustrates how sages arise from the common people—
not all common people are sages or worthy.

A full hall of seated guests,
each with their own drinking vessel—
all guests in the hall,
yet their drinking vessels differ in shape.
Yet the purpose of the ring and belt remains the same.
The drinking vessel and the ring and belt
are but one principle in application.
Though their forms may vary,
their use is identical.

The virtue of Duke Xian of Jin
was overshadowed by *Nǎo Jī* (孋姬);
he killed *Shēn Shēng* (申生).
The wisdom of *Shū Sūn* (叔孙)
was deceived by *Shù Niú* (竖牛);
he starved to death in three days without food.

Thus, when *Zhēn Zhān* (郑詹) fled to Lu,
*Chūnqiū* (春秋) noted: "A flatterer comes, a flatterer comes."
*Zhēn Zhān* was a minister of Duke Wen of Zheng.
When King Huan of Qi died,
he did not let Duke Bo of Zheng attend the mourning rites in Qi,
but instead went to Chu—
the people of Qi captured him,
and he escaped to Lu,
hence he was called a flatterer.
Comparing him to *Nǎo Jī* and *Shù Niú*,
it was said: "A flatterer comes, a flatterer comes."

When a noble has wine,
a vulgar man drums the *fǒu* (缶),
though he may not appear refined,
he is also not despised.
*Chǒu* (丑) means "evil."

Human nature favors silk and fine fabrics,
yet some are clad in armor when shot at—
for what they find inconvenient,
they may gain what is convenient.
Convenient means advantageous.

The spokes fit into the hub,
each matching its own notch,
yet none can pass through another—
just as ministers each uphold their duties,
and none should interfere.
*Gàn* (干) means "to乱 disturb."

Those who have escaped arrows while clad in armor
have entered water while wearing it;
those who have crossed water while holding a jar
have shielded themselves from fire with it—
this may be called ignorance of analogy.

When a noble dwells among the people,
it is like guiding a galloping horse with rotten reins—
elegant yet fearful of losing the people's will.

Or like a *jiāo* (蛟) lurking beneath thin ice—
the *jiāo*, a venomous fish,
its skin bearing poisonous pearls,
capable of harming others—
hence it is said the *jiāo* lurks beneath.

Or like encountering a nursing tiger in the woods—
speaking of constant dread and fear.

If governance does not take root among the people,
the people will not rally to it.

One who skillfully employs others
is like the *qínqú* (蚈) of a horse—
its many feet do not harm one another;
the *qínqú* is the hoof of the *āfēng* (幽州) steed,
called *Xīnqú* (秦渠) in the state of You.
*Qínqú* is read as the *qí* (蹊) in "pathway."

Or like the lips and teeth—
firm and soft, rubbing close yet not destroying each other.
*Mó* (摩) means "near," *bài* (败) means "to ruin."

The beauty of *qīngdà* (清□)
begins with its unrefined state;
*qīngdà* refers to *qīngjiǔ* (清酒).
The *Zhōu Lǐ* (周礼) states: "The *dà* (□) is made pure."
*Dà* is read as *wèngyāng* (瓮鸯) in "gathering."

The beauty of *bìmò* (黼黻)
lies in the *zhù* (杼) and *yǔ* (柚).
White and black form *bì* (黼),
blue and red form *mò* (黻)—
both are patterned garments.
New *bù* (布) is not as good as *zhù* (纻),
and worn *zhù* is not as good as *bù*;
some excel in making it new,
others fail in preserving its old state.
*Shàn* (善) means "proper."

*Yè* (靥) and *yáo* (酺) on the cheek are pleasing,
but on the forehead, they are evil.
*Yè* and *yáo* are the dimples on the cheeks;
when they appear on the forehead,
it is done with a plate—
hence it is evil.

Embroidery is fitting as a lower garment,
but as a headdress, it invites ridicule.
The *Shī* (诗) says: "The *gǔn* (衮) robe with embroidered lower garment—
hence it is fitting."
*Jī* (讥) means people criticize it as improper.

The teeth of a horse are not the hooves of an ox,
the roots of *tán* (檀) wood are not the branches of a *yǐ* (椅)—
thus, seeing one principle,
all things are known.

Stone is born hard,
orchid is born fragrant,
though their qualities may be subtle at first—
as they grow, their traits become ever clearer.
*Zhì* (质) means "nature," *míng* (明) means "abundant."

To support and to lift,
to decline and to yield,
to accept and to precede,
to agree and to possess—
the difference between *zhī* (之) and *yǐ* (矣)
is vast as a thousand *lǐ* (里).

Sweat drips like powder on the forehead,
a rotting rat lies on the altar—
in Chu, the courtyard is called the *tán* (坛).
Burning and fumigating in the palace;
entering water yet hating to be wet,
embracing stench while seeking fragrance—
even the skilled cannot master these.

Though *shàn* (善) may sometimes mean *qiǎo* (巧, clever),
those who are reborn do not reap,
and those who bloom in great drought do not fall in season.
*Xū shí* (胥时) means "to wither without waiting for autumn."

Do not say "unfortunate"
when a *dēng* (甑) never falls into a well.
Plucking a hairpin to summon *lín* (磷),
what cause is there for alarm?
*Lín* is blood-essence,
like wildfire—
when summoned, it responds with a sound.
Blood splashed on a person,
if summoned with a hairpin, it does not come—
hence, what cause for alarm?

Though one may wish to rescue a lost horse,
they do not open the threshold *chēng* (辚).
Speaking of: when a horse is lost,
one cannot open the threshold to seek it.
Though one may wish to prepare wine in advance,
they do not carry the *rù* (蓐).
*Chēng* (辚) is the threshold,
in Chu it is called *chēng*.

Though one may wish to rescue a lost horse,
they do not open the threshold *chēng* (辚).
Speaking of: when a horse is lost,
one cannot open the threshold to seek it.
Though one may wish to prepare wine in advance,
they do not carry the *rù* (蓐).

One who rescues from fever by forcing hot food,
who saves from heatstroke by giving cold drinks,
who aids a strained sinew by tightening its rope,
who rescues a drowning victim by offering them a stone—
though they intend to help,
they instead cause harm.
*Hài* (害) means "to harm."

Though one may wish to rescue a lost horse,
they do not open the threshold *chēng* (辚).
Speaking of: when a horse is lost,
one cannot open the threshold to seek it.
Though one may wish to prepare wine in advance,
they do not carry the *rù* (蓐).
*Chēng* (辚) is the threshold,
in Chu it is called *chēng*.

Winter ice can be bent,
summer wood can be knotted—
opportune moments are hard to obtain yet easy to lose.
Wood, when flourishing,
may be gathered all day yet still not be known;
autumn winds with frost,
may exhaust it in a single night.
*Dān* (殚) means "to exhaust."

One who treats heat with forced nourishment,
who relieves heatstroke with cold drinks,
who strains a tendon by pulling its cord,
who saves a drowning man by handing him a stone—
though they mean to help,
they instead bring ruin.
*É* (恶) means "harm."

The *tóngyīng* (铜英) is green,
the *jīnyīng* (金英) is yellow,
the *yùyīng* (玉英) is white—
their radiance is like *zhuó* (烛) and *zé* (捔),
and their luster is like *gāozhuó* (膏烛).
*Zhuó* and *zé* illuminate like bright pearls—
thus, one knows the subtle from the manifest,
the external from the internal.

The taste of *xiàngròu* (象肉) is unknown to the mouth,
the appearance of *guǐshén* (鬼神) is unseen by the eye,
the doctrine of *bǔjǐng* (捕景) is not grasped by the heart—
all are things one has never experienced.

Opportune moments are hard to obtain yet easy to lose.
Wood, when flourishing,
may be gathered all day yet still not be known;
autumn winds with frost,
may exhaust it in a single night.
*Dān* (殚) means "to exhaust."

The *shuǐqí* (水虿) becomes *qīng* (□),
the *jiējīng* (孑孑) becomes *qīng* (□)—
the *shuǐqīng* (水□) transforms into *yāng* (□).
*Qīng* refers to *qīngqīng* (青蜓, green dragonfly).
*Jiējīng* (孑孑) is *jiējiāng* (结姜),
a water insect reaching to the *qǐ* (跂, ankle) when standing—
read as *liánxié* (廉絜).

The *tùniè* (兔啮) becomes *shuò* (螚)—
the grass bitten by a hare,
with its spirit lingering in the heart,
transforms into *shuò*.
*Shuò* is read as *néng* (能) with *xīn* (心) being evil.
Another saying holds: *shuò* is the bite of a hare,
a kind of insect.

What things do is beyond expectation—
those who do not know are alarmed,
those who know are not perplexed.
*Guài* (怪) means "bewildered."

The *tóngyīng* (铜英) is green,
the *jīnyīng* (金英) is yellow,
the *yùyīng* (玉英) is white—
their radiance is like *zhuó* (烛) and *zé* (捔),
and their luster is like *gāozhuó* (膏烛).
*Zhuó* and *zé* illuminate like bright pearls—
thus, one knows the subtle from the manifest,
the external from the internal.

who strains a tendon by pulling its cord,
who saves a drowning man by handing him a stone—
though they mean to help,
they instead bring ruin.
*É* (恶) means "harm."」

The threshold’s name, pronounced like *"lín"* (邻),
is obtained when *éqi* (恶气) speaks—thus it is known.

Mèng Bēn probes the mouse’s den,
the mouse dies not at once—
it bites his finger, and he loses his advantage.
Mèng Bēn, the valiant warrior,
dug for the mouse in its hole—
thus he lost his strength.

Mountain clouds rise, moistening the column’s base;
the *chǔ* (础) is dampened—
the stone foundation beneath the pillar.

When *fúlíng* (伏苓) is dug up, the rabbit’s thread dies.
What is born perishes—
thus it dies.

One household’s hearth fire lost,
a hundred households burn;
the slanderer’s hidden schemes
leave the people’s corpses exposed.
*The Analects* says:
*"Woe to the glib tongue that overturns a state!"*
Thus it is said: the people’s corpses lie bare.

Grain soaked in water grows warm,
rice cooked in fire becomes soft—
water holds fire, fire holds water.
Swift thunder shatters stone—
*yīnyáng* (阴阳) press close.
This is the natural order.

Bathing in the River brings little gain,
yet better than none at all.
The *Liú Liáo* (流僚) flows to the sea—
though it cannot add more,
it is still better than stagnation.
*Yǐ* (已) means "to cease."

A net with one eye cannot catch birds,
a hook without bait cannot catch fish;
encountering a scholar without courtesy
cannot win virtue.

The rabbit’s thread grows without root,
the serpent moves without feet,
the fish hears without ears,
the cicada sings without a mouth—
such is their nature.

The crane lives a thousand years,
exhausting its wanderings;
the *shānshū* (蛶疏) is born at dawn and dies at dusk,
yet it fulfills its joy.
Life’s span and purpose each find their measure.

Zhòu (纣) slew Mèi Bó (梅伯),
while King Wén (文王) plotted with the feudal lords.
*Gòu* (构) means "to scheme."

Jiè (桀) slew his advisors,
while Shàng (汤) sent mourners to weep for them.
*Kū* (哭) is like *diào* (吊)—
a lamentation.

The maddened horse does not strike the wood,
the fierce dog does not hurl itself into the river;
though the deaf insect does not fall into a pit of its own accord,
how much more so is this true of humans!

Deafness, here, means ignorance.

To love the bear yet feed it salt,
to love the otter yet give it wine—
though one may wish to nurture them,
this is not their Dao/Way.

The bear dies from eating salt,
the otter perishes from drinking wine,
thus it is said: *This is not their Dao/Way.*

What the heart desires, it wrecks the boat to make a staff;
what the heart desires, it shatters the bell to make a *diào* (大铃).
A *diào* (大铃) is a large bell.
A *jīn kǒu mù shé* (金口木舌) with wooden tongue is called a *mù diào* (木铎),
and one with a golden tongue is called a *jīn diào* (金铎).

*Zhù* (杕) is the stern of a boat—
in reciting the *Shī* (诗), there is the autumnal *shè* (社).

Guan Zhòng (管仲) turned small humiliation into great honor.
Guan Zhòng served Prince Jiǎo (子纠) of Qi (齐),
yet could not die for him,
and was imprisoned by Lu (鲁)—
this was his humiliation.
In the end, he served Duke Huán (桓公) of Qi,
and thus attained hegemony—
this was his great honor.

Sū Qín (苏秦) turned a hundred untruths into one sincerity;
sincerity is trust.

When the target is raised, bows and arrows gather;
when the forest flourishes, axes and hatchets enter—
not summoned by any, yet drawn by circumstances.
To wait for profit before rescuing the drowning,
one will surely also drown others for profit.
He who profits from another’s drowning
is one who takes advantage of another’s misfortune for his own gain.

A boat can sink or float,
yet the fool does not dare to add weight.
A boat can carry floating objects,
yet the fool does not dare to add his own foot,
for fear it will sink.
This is the meaning of the *Shī* (诗) passage:
*"Ten thousand boats drift on the waters,
some sink, some float."*

The swift steed urged on does not advance,
pulled back does not halt—
yet a ruler does not take this as a measure of distance.
He who criticizes my conduct
wishes to engage with me in debate,
he who scorns my goods
wishes to trade with me.
*Criticize* is akin to *deny*.
*Scorn* means *to disparage*.

Mixing water with water makes it unfit to drink,
a single-stringed *sè* (瑟) cannot be heard.
Because it lacks harmony,
it cannot be heard.
*Criticize* is to single out faults.

The fine horse is restrained to death,
the upright scholar is driven to ruin;
the virtuous are cast aside from court,
the beautiful women are rejected from the palace.
*Cast aside* means *to abandon*.

The traveler thinks of the Dao/Way,
while the recluse dreams in his bed;
the tender mother sings in the lane,
the wayward son pines in the wilderness of Jīng (荆).
Their spirits are in constant exchange.

When fresh meat is hung, crows gather,
when the eagle and falcon appear, other birds scatter—
the gathering and scattering of things
arise from mutual resonance.

He who eats the food does not damage the vessel,
he who plucks the fruit does not break the branches.
To block its roots is to exhaust its strength,
to sever its origin is to wither it.
Interlocking lines are not smooth,
linked rings cannot be undone—
yet it is not the *jié* (解) that undoes them.
*Smooth* means *unobstructed*.
They cannot reach the unobstructed end.
*Interlocking* means *to stop*.
To undo linked rings is to say:
*"If this cannot be undone, then speak of virtue and Dao/Way to resolve it."*

To gaze at fish by the river
is not as good as returning home to recognize the net.
*Gaze* means *to covet*.

The pearl of the bright moon
is a *shuǎng* (蠬) worm’s ailment yet my gain;
the tiger’s claws and elephant’s tusks
are the harm of beasts yet my ruin.
*I* is the same as *man*.

A good horse is made to desire speed,
drinking wine brings joy and makes one want to sing.
To do this is called *duàn* (断);
to do the opposite is called *luàn* (乱).
*Duàn* means *to govern*.

An arrow flies swiftly,
yet it does not pass two *lǐ* (里);
but by steady pacing,
a thousand *shè* (舍) can be traversed without rest,
and a thousand *lǐ* (里) can be reached.

The sage dwells in the *yīn* (阴),
the common man dwells in the *yáng* (阳);
the sage walks on the *shuǐ* (水),
the common man walks on the *shuāng* (霜).
Water has form yet cannot be destroyed,
so the sage walks upon it leaving no trace;
footprints remain on frost and snow,
so the common man walks upon them.

Those with different sounds cannot be heard under one *lǜ* (律),
those with different forms cannot be united into one body.
*United* means *the same*.

The farmer toils while the *jūnzǐ* (君子) nurtures him,
the *jūnzǐ*, the sovereign lord.
Nurturing him means to transform and benefit with *huà* (化) and *zé* (泽),
so that he may rest in contentment.

The foolish speak while the wise select what to use.
They choose what is useful and apply it accordingly.
Abandoning lush forests to gather at withered trees,
not hunting the crane but hunting the crow,
such actions reveal no grand design.
*Design* means *planning*.
This illustrates their foolishness.

The *yín* (寅) mound has no great ravines,
its spring source does not spread wide;
*Yín* refers to the small, murky waters.
The *yín* mound lacks deep ravines,
so its waters cannot flow broadly.
Even ordinary streams can irrigate vast marshes—
this speaks of a proper source.

If the path is clear, dwell upon it like jade and stone;
if the path is dark and obscure, one must still ponder its course.
Jade and stone, here, signify discernment;
*dark and obscure* means unclear.
*Ponder* means to think and plan.

To entrust the whole world’s weight upon one man’s talent
is like suspending a thousand *jūn* (钧) in burden upon a single branch of wood—
this speaks of its impossibility.

is called an ill omen,
for one man falls while another perishes.
*Carrying* means embracing.
*Falls* means to tumble.

Those who excel in undertaking matters
are like riding a boat while singing mournful songs—
one sings, and a thousand respond in harmony.
This speaks of their ability to win the hearts of the people.

Unable to farm yet craving millet and wheat,
unable to weave yet delighting in embroidered garments,
seeking rewards without effort—
this is truly difficult.

Where there is splendor, there must be decay;
where there are fine silks, there must be coarse hemp.
This speaks of rise and fall being inevitable.

Birds that stir the waters into waves
make the *Hé Bó* (河伯) retreat and not rise,
for he fears their sincerity.
*Birds* refers to the *Dà Péng* (大鹏).
Soaring above the water,
they fan the fish, causing waves to boil,
then seize and devour them—
thus the *Hé Bó* hides deep in the abyss,
fearing their earnest devotion,
and remains unseen.
Hence, one man’s resolve to risk death
makes a thousand chariots not dare to act lightly.

The *Zhǔshù* (主术) chapter states:
"War is never more dreadful than when waged by a determined individual;
the blade that cannot be deflected is the inferior one."
This speaks of a commoner’s resolve to risk death ensuring victory,
so even if a great state has a thousand chariots,
they will not act lightly against him.

When locusts or snakes sting a man,
applying *héqiàn* (和堇) will heal him—
*héqiàn*, wild *gě* (葛), *dú lè* (毒乐).
This shows that some harms can become benefits.

In a chaotic age, the sage endures like summer’s heat awaiting evening’s cool—
*summer* refers to the intense midday heat,
*evening* refers to the refreshing time.
This speaks of the sage enduring turmoil with patience.

Between the *sāng* (桑) and *yú* (榆),
crossing is easier to bear—
this speaks of chaotic times nearing their end,
like the sun passing through the *Sāngyú* (桑榆) interval toward sunset,
making endurance easier.

Though water may be level,
waves will inevitably arise;
though a balance may be true,
it will inevitably tilt.

Though a ruler’s measure may be uniform,
inevitably there will be discrepancies.
*Incongruity* means variation.

Without compass and square, one cannot establish the square and round;
without plumb and level, one cannot rectify the crooked and straight.
Yet those who use compass and square, plumb and level
also have their own compass and square, plumb and level.
The one who levels and straightens can only level and straighten—
thus it is said that even they have their compass and square, plumb and level.

Only when a boat capsizes does one see the skill of the swimmer;
only when a horse bolts does one see the skill of the charioteer.
The skilled swimmer, though the boat capsizes, does not drown;
the skilled charioteer, though the horse bolts, does not crash—
thus they are revealed.

What is chewed without flavor cannot be swallowed;
what is seen without form cannot be contemplated in the mind.
*Form* refers to image.
What is invisible to the eye cannot be contemplated in the mind.

Though a rhinoceros and tiger lurk behind,
and the *Suíhóu’s Pearl* lies before,
one who cannot reach it first avoids the peril and then seeks the gain.

*Suíhóu* was a state east of the Han River, of the *Jī* clan lineage.
While hunting in the wild, its ruler saw a great snake cut in two on the ground.
He ordered a physician to suture and bind the severed snake,
and the snake recovered and departed.
Later, it returned bearing a great pearl—
the *Moonlight Pearl*—
and thus it was named the *Suíhóu’s Pearl*,
treasured by the world ever since.

The hunter of deer does not chase the hare;
the merchant selling a thousand *jin* of goods does not haggle over *zhū* or *liǎng* of price.
This speaks of focusing on the great and neglecting the small.

A bow must first be bent before seeking its strength;
a horse must first be broken before seeking its excellence.
*Strength* means power; *broken* means trained.
A person must first be trusted before seeking their ability.
A person cannot stand without trust.

The potter discards his rope—
the charioteer picks it up;
the butcher discards his knife—
the swordsmith collects it.
Their priorities differ in urgency.

The light of a hundred stars
does not compare to the light of one moon;
a hundred windows fully open
cannot match the brightness of one door.

An arrow shot from ten paces pierces rhinoceros hide—
yet at its limit, it cannot penetrate *Lǔ silk*.
This speaks of limits in power.

Tai Mountain’s height, when viewed from behind, is unseen;
the tip of an autumn hair, when examined, is discernible.
*Discernible* means to distinguish.
This speaks of the application of clarity.

Mountains produce gold, yet it returns to carve itself;
Trees breed worms, yet they consume themselves;
Humans create affairs, yet they harm themselves.
*Harm* means ruin, means destruction.
Things follow their natural course.

A skilled caster can melt wood,
Yet a craftsman cannot carve gold—
Such is the nature of their forms.
Unpolished white jade remains beautiful,
Unengraved fine pearls retain their luster—
Their substance is already complete.
Nature is self-sufficient; no further adornment is needed.

Thus, even halting steps, if unceasing,
Can carry a lame tortoise a thousand *lǐ*;
*Halting* means a short stride.
Accumulation without pause
Can raise a mound or hill.
*Pause* means to stop.

A city built above, wood straight below—
No artificial effort is required;
It is simply the way things unfold.

In the way of using people,
It is like striking fire with a flint:
Too slack, and you fail to ignite;
*Slack* means delay.
Too hasty, and you miss the mark;
*Hasty* means speed.
The key lies between slackness and haste.
Master the rhythm, and fire will arise.

Follow the crooked to straighten it—it shifts;
Follow the bent to align it—it falters.
*Bent* means perverse.

The Sage harmonizes with things
Like a mirror reflecting form,
Revealing their true nature.
*Harmonizes* means aligns.

Yangzi wept at the sight of a crossroad,
For it could lead south or north.
*A crossroad* is called *duì*—
He pitied its divisions.

Mozi wept at white silk being dyed,
For it could become yellow or black.
*White* is *liàn*—
He lamented its transformation.

The Way of approaching and departing aligns with things,
Like the harmony of bronze and stone when tuned together—
Though separated by a thousand years, they resonate in one sound.
Bronze is called *zhōng*—the bell,
Stone is called *pán*—the chime-stone.
Though ages pass without change,
It is said they still resonate in one sound.

Birds that do not perch upon the snares,
Though near, are not trapped—
For they do not belong to that category.
When they cross the Dao,
Though distant, they are not released—
*Cross the Dao* means they become obstacles,
Hence they are not released.

Sour wine and rotten meat,
Yet sour wine and rotten meat do not stray from the butcher’s and merchant’s homes—
Hence, seeking things must be done among the near.

With deceit to meet deceit,
With guile to meet guile,
It is like wearing a raincoat to extinguish fire,
Or breaking a sacred vessel to stop the waters—
The more you do, the more it increases.

Xi Shi and Mao Qiang,
Their features could not be the same—
Yet the world calls them both beloved,
For beauty is equally balanced.

Emperor Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang,
Their laws and decrees were of different kinds,
Yet they all won the hearts of the people in one way.
All were united in their alignment with humanity.

The Sage acts according to the times,
Establishes merit based on resources—
In flood, they prepare the *zhuóduì* to hold water,
In drought, they craft the *tǔlóng* to summon rain.
*Zhuóduì* are water reservoirs,
*Tǔlóng* are rain-inducing implements.

The women of Linzi,
Seeing fine silk and thinking of its use,
Are troubled by its coarse and vulgar nature.
*Linzi* is the capital of Qi.
*Troubled* means crude and harsh.

A house with fine adornments,
Yet the silks are left unrefined—
Because the intention is not sealed,
The mind is stirred by their imperfection.
*Unrefined* is read as *jùn yì*—to refine and weave.

The music of *Zheng Yu*,
Does not enter the ears of common folk—
*Zheng Yu* is the proper tone,
Which people do not know.
When it is turned and adjusted,
All present are pleased.
*Turned* means to shift its harmony,
Changing to a more urgent rhythm—
The refined and elegant sounds,
Though not true music, are thus praised.

Passing by a granary with hands clasped,
Few would harbor thieving intent—
A granary is where goods are stored.
Hence, those who mock the spirits,
Pass by the ancestral shrines and shake their branches.
*Mock* means to harm.

At Jinyang, the *Chùfù* of the State of Dai,
Saved Chu by rescuing the Jiang—
Hence, loosening the *jiēgé* is not about cutting the ropes,
But about striking and pushing.
*Strike* means to hit,
*Pushing* means to thrust at the vital junctures.
Great trees have deep roots,
High mountains have sturdy bases—
Yet their lower parts are vulnerable.
Massive creatures have distant ambitions,
Large bodies have loose restraints.

The mad harm others,
Yet none blame them;
Infants revile the elderly,
Yet none take offense;
Thieving intent is natural.

The loyalty of *Weisheng*,
Is not as good as the *yán* of *Suiniu* and *Xian Gao*.
*Weisheng* pledged faith to a woman,
Yet his loyalty was lost.
*Suiniu* and *Xian Gao* feigned to disobey their lord’s commands,
Though they did so, their intent was to preserve the state—
Hence, their *yán* is not as good as *Suiniu’s* and *Xian Gao’s*.
And much less so for those who never act with faith or feigning.

Those who grieve for their father’s illness are sons,
Those who heal it are physicians.
*The Analects* say: "Only for their parents’ sickness do the children grieve."
Hence, it is said: "Those who grieve are sons."

Those who present offerings are *zhù*,
Those who conduct sacrifices are *fū*—the officiants.
