**The Tuoyuezi: The Three Ways Illuminate the True and Return to the Root (Chapter One)**

The Tuoyuezi said: Heaven possesses its essence, Earth possesses its numen. Should a person obtain them, they may attain longevity. In heaven, they form images; on earth, they take shape. Shape and image receive qi, and from qi arise essence and numen. One cannot abandon shape to seize image, nor abandon image to seize shape. To seize shape is to lose image; to lose image is to have no shape.

Someone asked: What is the essence of heaven? What is the numen of earth? And how can they determine a person’s life and death?

He replied: The essence of heaven is treasure; the numen of earth is treasure.

Asked: What is treasure?

Gold and jade. In ancient times, the Dark Emperor refined gold within the Grotto-Heavens, and the Azure Youth buried jade in the Hidden Palace. Thus we know: without treasure, heaven’s sun and moon would not shine so brightly; without treasure, earth’s mountains and peaks would not remain eternally still; without treasure, a person’s form and spirit would not endure in wholeness.

Asked: From whence does treasure arise, that it is thus?

He replied: Yin and yang congeal qi. Heaven and earth cover and bear all. Spring warms with benevolence; summer heats with propriety; autumn chills with righteousness; winter freezes with wisdom. Through such transformations, treasure is accomplished. When yin prevails, it becomes gold; when yang abounds, it crystallizes as jade. This is how I know it to be so.

Asked: Can other medicines be used to produce it?

He replied: All medicines that are wrought do so by revolving yin to activate yang, turning softness into hardness. They are nourished by the qi of the Five Phases and invigorated by the qi of the four seasons. Thus their transformations likewise accord with nature.

Asked: Heaven and earth endure forever—can they be without treasure?

He said: Indeed.

Asked: Are humans the same as heaven and earth?

He said: The same.

Asked: Why then do humans not equal heaven and earth in longevity, but perish in an instant?

He replied: Heaven and earth are without desire, so their treasure remains ever-present, and thus they endure. The human heart harbors desire, and so its treasure is lost—hence the fleeting moment.

Asked: I now recognize the treasure of heaven and earth. But the treasure within humans remains unclear. I wish to hear its principle.

He replied: The treasure of humans lies in taking bone as gold, marrow as jade, spirit as essence, and numen as consciousness. Once a person is stained by desire, marrow is exhausted and bones wither. When marrow is exhausted, essence loses its spirit; when bones wither, numen loses its consciousness. When numen loses consciousness, spirit scatters; when essence loses its spirit, qi perishes. Thus the heart grows senile, the face wrinkles, the brain shrinks, and the hair turns white—all because the body’s treasure gradually departs. When it is entirely gone, death follows.

Asked: My face is already wrinkled, my hair already white—am I to die?

He replied: Yes.

Asked: If I rid myself of desire, can my treasure be restored?

He said: It cannot be restored.

Asked: Earlier you said heaven and earth are without desire and thus endure forever. Since humans are no different from heaven and earth, if I emulate their lack of desire, why can my treasure not be restored?

He replied: Treasure is difficult to obtain but easy to lose. You have already lost it—it is difficult to recover.

Asked: Are you deceiving me? You claim that with treasure one lives, without it one dies. Yet I see that I have not died, so my treasure must still remain. If treasure remains, then without desire I should endure forever. Why do you now say that without desire my treasure cannot be restored? In matters of life and fate, one should not jest.

He said: I do not jest with you.

Asked: What other method can restore my treasure?

He said: You are not a spirit-inspector—you confuse others with such questions.

Thereupon, for three days and nights, he neither slept nor rested, pondering without cease until his bones stood stark. Yet the principle of spirit-inspection remained utterly obscure. He reflected on the master’s words and entreated him to impart the hidden secret.

He replied: Spirit-inspection means inspecting things and inspecting oneself—hence the name.

Asked: I see only inspection of things—where is the inspection of oneself?

He said: Without self-inspection, how can it be called spirit-inspection? Since you do not understand, I shall explain further.

Now, heaven and earth are without desire, so their treasure remains ever-present. Yet even they are steamed by the four seasons, and their treasure threatens to wither; they are turned by the Five Phases, and their treasure threatens to be exhausted. Thus the Dark Emperor and the Azure Youth buried gold and filled with jade—to replenish the withering and exhaustion of heaven and earth. This is why brightness does not cease and stillness does not move. But you, with desire in your heart, have nearly exhausted your treasure, yet you do not comprehend the principle of replenishment. Instead, you vainly cling to withered bones and depleted marrow—how can you compare to heaven and earth?

He said: I understand! The dull and the wise are divided; dawn and dusk obscure themselves. Now that I have heard these words, I truly know that a withered face can be rejuvenated and white hair can turn black again.

He said: It is not that gold cannot rejuvenate the face, nor that jade cannot darken the hair. If you but diligently seek, you shall obtain it.

I revere the master’s teaching. You are teachable, and I shall follow you devotedly. I will surely transmit it to you.

**The Five Phases Establish Positions; Springs and Stones (Chapter Two)**

The Tuoyuezi said: Heaven generates the Five Materials—none can be lacking. How much more so for the Way of the Golden Elixir—how can it be forgotten? Seeing your accumulated diligence and unwavering reverence for secrets, I now wish to expound. Calm your heart and still your form.

The Five Materials extend upward to heaven, where the Five Luminaries are established; they accumulate downward on earth, where the Five Peaks stand firm; they take form within humans, where the Five Viscera arise. They circulate through the myriad things yet never fail in their true origin.

Asked: What is the true origin?

He replied: The primordial qi.

Asked: Are the primordial qi and the Five Materials the same?

He said: The primordial qi—vast, it envelops the eight directions; minute, it hides within a single hair. It exhales Kun and inhales Qian, emerging from existence and entering non-existence. The Five Materials receive its governance and thus become the forerunners of all things.

Thus, the Five Materials do not depart from primordial qi, nor does primordial qi depart from the Five Materials. When their names are blended, they are one; when their functions are distinguished, they are distinct. Therefore, primordial qi is the lord of the Five Materials, and the Five Materials are the ministers of primordial qi. Thus, lord and ministers stand in mutual attendance, and neither can be set aside.

Asked: Does the Golden Elixir employ primordial qi and the Five Materials?
He replied: It does employ them.
Asked: Do primordial qi and the Five Materials possess form?
He said: Primordial qi is originally formless. Through essence it generates form, and those who ingest it neither die nor live.

Primordial qi departs from the Five Materials and becomes invisible; the Five Materials lose primordial qi and cease to function.
Asked: From my youth, I have explored the mysterious arts for over a decade. What I have heard from you, Master, are profound teachings that astonish both ear and eye, stirring the spirit and moving the true. I wish to be shown the forms of primordial qi and the Five Materials within the Golden Elixir.
He said: How could I have obtained this apart from the supreme art? The distinctions in names and terms are merely apparent.

Now, primordial qi is quicksilver; the Five Materials are the Five Metals.
Asked: The meaning of quicksilver as primordial qi is clear, but the Five Metals remain obscure to my dull mind.
He said: The Five Metals are black lead.
Asked: Lead is of a single color—are there others besides it?
He replied: Since you do not yet understand this, you must be deeply perplexed. Truly, listen to my discourse!

The reason quicksilver is called primordial qi is that quicksilver is chaotic and undifferentiated, beyond description by form or image. When it flies upward, it becomes cinnabar—this is Lesser Yang. When cinnabar reverts to quicksilver, this is Lesser Yin. As for black bismuth, when it transforms into yellow lead, this is Greater Yang; when yellow lead changes into black lead, this is Greater Yin. These two substances are beyond the reckoning of gods and the knowledge of sages. One Yin, one Yang, they govern the four directions, undergo a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, subdue all minerals, serve as the root of the Dao, and are the source of the Elixir.

Moreover, lead is black externally, and its number is one; cinnabar is white internally, and its number is four. When one is paired with four, the principle of five is established.
Asked: The Dao is nearing its culmination in the Divine Elixir! Now that I have received your explanation, sorrow and gratitude intertwine. Should these two substances be used directly, or are there branches and leaves? Are these two the root, and the eight minerals the stem?
He said: I have heard you say before, Master, that gold and jade fill and mend heaven and earth—how much more so for humans! I wish to hear it all, to open my heart and eyes.
He replied: Since you follow me, why fear you will not attain it? The Dao cannot be obtained in haste, nor can the true be sought and gained suddenly. Let us wait for another day, when I will discourse for you in full.

**Chapter Three: The Eight Trigrams Illuminate Images and Indications**
Cui Yaizi said: The essence of the Eight Trigrams strikes its image in the moon. This Dao is supremely great and cannot be conveyed by mere speech. I will draw a diagram for you, so you may distinguish them.

On the evening of the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*; its image is *chen*, its essence is wood, its flavor is sour, and its name is green.
On the evening of the eighth day, the moon emerges at *ding*; its image is *dui*, its essence is metal, its flavor is acrid, and its name is white.
On the evening of the thirteenth day, the moon emerges at *jia*; its essence is metal, its flavor is acrid, and its name is white.
At dawn on the sixteenth day, the moon appears at *xin*; its image is *xun*, its essence is wood, its flavor is sour, and its name is green.
At dawn on the twenty-third day, the moon appears at *bing*; its image is *gen*, its essence is earth, its flavor is sweet, and its name is male.
At dawn on the twenty-ninth day, the moon sets at *yi*; its image is *kun*, its essence is earth, its flavor is sweet, and its name is female.

Cui Yaizi said: If you wish to ponder this, you must concentrate your spirit and mind on the Dao, and you will naturally connect with the celestial tally.
Asked: I have heard you say, Master, that the Eight Trigrams correspond to the eight minerals. Now I see only six—may I hear the remaining two?
He replied: These two images are still hidden by heaven and earth. How dare I reveal the heavenly Dao? In truth, I have not received transmission from a teacher; it is through the communion of refined essence that I have gained understanding. When I sought to speak of it, my heart turned inward to the formless. For seven days and six nights, I came to realize it. It was as if I had met the Immortal Lords of the Five Metals, who expounded the Dao of Three Transformations and Five Revolutions. I knew not how it came to be!

Walking along the path, I drummed my belly and sang, then came to your gate and said: "Little one, I have understood!" I said to him: "Excellent! You have attained the Dao of long life!"

**Chapter Four: The Four Seasons’ Hard and Soft Complete the Year**
Tuo Yaizi said: Heaven completes the myriad things through the four seasons; humans nourish their forms through the four qi. How much more should the wondrous Dao of the furnace and fire emulate this?
Asked: What is the wondrous Dao of the furnace and fire?
He replied: The Dao of heaven: Yang moves at *zi* and ascends at *si*—this is spring and summer. Yin germinates at *wu* and descends at *hai*—this is autumn and winter. When the qi of the four seasons flow in order, a year is completed. On the ninth day, when the heat is at its peak, the Five Metals take flight.
Asked: What I have heard from you, Master, is like emerging from a ravine to cross the vast sea!

**Chapter Five: The Ninefold Dao Attains Non-Action**
Tuo Yaizi said: The Dao is called the unity of one Yin and one Yang. The Dao begins with one and ends with nine. Thus, the Golden Elixir undergoes nine revolutions and must embody the Five Constants. The August One arises from Yin and Yang, and thus all under heaven serve it. When the myriad images are penetrated and the spirit is numinous, even if one aspect is lacking, how is it different from mere tiles and stones?

Therefore, it can transform bones and flesh, refine the body into light qi, and attain boundless freedom. It roams the Great Veil in carefree abandon. Thus, life and death melt like ice, the dust and filth vanish like smoke. One bows before the Jade Emperor in the radiant scenery, pays homage in the Palace of Pure Life, may receive a mandate from the Eastern Flower, or hold a decree in the celestial clouds. It also clarifies the blessings of seven generations. Accumulating goodness through non-action, it achieves greatness without striving.

The Master of Abandoning the Key states: "#1 '柔' should be rendered as '弃'."
