**Preface to the Houguanzi**
Hanzi said:
*The Houguanzi* contains sixteen chapters, its language blending *Huang-Lao* (Yellow Emperor-Laozi) thought with *Xíngmíng* (Legalist-Nominalist) theory. The *Bó Xuǎn* chapter’s doctrine of fourfold verification and fivefold attainment is correct—if such a person encountered the right time, grasped the Dao, and applied it to governance, what great virtue and achievement would not follow?

In the *Xué Wèn* chapter, it speaks of how the lowly arise from uselessness, how one loses their vessel in midstream, and how a single jar may hold a thousand gold coins—I have read these words three times and felt sorrow for them.

The text contains thirty-five errors: three *yǐ* (transpositions), twenty-two *zāng* (omissions), and twelve *zhù* (corruptions). I have corrected them.

Lüzi said:
Houguanzi was a man of Chu, dwelling in Tànshān, wearing a crown of *guàn* (hoopoe) feathers, hence his name. His teachings are inconsistent—beginning with *Huang-Lao* but later veering toward *Xíngmíng*.

The *Transmission* says: Shen Buhai and Han Fei refined *name* and *reality*, cutting to the core of affairs. Though their methods were harsh and lacked benevolence, they still drew from the intent of *Dao* and *De*. This is how learning can go astray.

Thus, after Confucius and Mozi, the *Rú* (Confucian) school split into eight, and the *Mò* (Mohist) into three. Alas, must one not be cautious?

Though this book blends *Huang-Lao* and *Xíngmíng*, its core—like scattered fragments without a home—still occasionally reveals profound and subtle truths. From *Bó Xuǎn* to *Wǔ Líng Wáng Wèn*, there are nineteen chapters in total. Yet Han Yu, upon reading, claimed there were sixteen—this was not the complete work.

Though the book now exists in full, its text is riddled with errors, many beyond recovery. The saying goes: *"A book copied three times becomes a fish, a tiger, or the Emperor of Lu—is this not true?"* I lament this, so I have clarified what can be known and marked the rest as doubtful, awaiting scholars of broad learning.

**Houguanzi (Volume One)**
*Annotated by Lü Diàn*

**Chapter One: On the Selection of Talent**

*"The first principle of broad selection"*—King Fú#1 is not a tool for a single generation; he embodies **virtue/power** and eminent talent. King Fú#1 refers to the **Dao/Way** of governance. Master Jià#2 said: *"Authority and legal ordinances—these are the ruler’s axe and adze."* If one relies solely on legal ordinances without tempering them with **virtue/power**, yet still hopes to endure, how difficult will that be!

The **Dao/Way** is measured in four ways: first, by Heaven; second, by Earth; third, by humanity; fourth, by **commanding fate**. **Commanding fate** is what gives rise to it. Human **authority** has five degrees of response:
1. **Bóji**—those who are a hundred times better than oneself.
2. **Shíji**—those who are ten times better than oneself.
3. **Ruòji**—those equal to oneself.
4. **Sīyì**—those who serve as laborers for one.
5. **Túlì**—those who are mere commoners, even lower.

What is called Heaven is the **Dao/Way** of natural principles and human emotions. The **Dao/Way** does not dwell in one place; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Heaven, and thus it is as it is. What is called Earth is the **Dao/Way** of constant and unchanging affairs. The **Dao/Way** does not settle in one state; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Earth, and thus it is as it is.

What is called the **Dao/Way** of humanity is the aversion to death and love for life. What is called **commanding fate** is that none dare disobey. To say none dare disobey is to speak of **commanding fate**. The ruler is one who embodies clarity and **spiritual luminosity**. He governs without action yet commands reverence. **Spiritual luminosity** is to take humanity as the foundation. Following humanity brings ease, relying on oneself brings toil.

Humanity is to take the **virtue/power** of sages and worthies as the foundation. The **virtue/power** of sages and worthies is to take broad selection as the foundation. Shùn emerged from the fields, Fù#4 was raised from the laborers’ walls, Jiēgé from the fish and salt markets, Guān Yíwú from the ranks of scholars, Sūn Shū’áo from the seaside, Bǎilǐ Xī from the marketplace—thus, the path of selecting talent cannot be too narrow!

Broad selection is to take the five degrees of response as the foundation. Therefore, when one faces them respectfully and serves them, the **Bóji** will come. To face them respectfully and serve them is called *receiving* them. To hasten forward and then rest, to question first and then remain silent, the **Shíji** will come. To go before others and rest after them, to question before them and remain silent after them—though this also means lowering oneself—it differs from *receiving* them. Hence, the **Bóji** depart, while the **Shíji** arrive.

When others hasten and oneself hastens, the **Ruòji** will come. To hasten with others and rest with others is like flying in formation with them. Leaning on a table, propping on a staff, and issuing commands with gestures—then the **Sīyì** will come. To sit and lean on a table, to stand and prop on a staff, and to issue commands with gestures is still a matter of propriety. To delight in exclamations and despise sharp orders—then the **Túlì** will arrive.

Humanity is the foundation of all things—*the people are the people*. To delight in exclamations, to despise sharp orders—this is utterly lacking in propriety. If not for shameless men, who would willingly endure this?

Thus, the sage ruler dwells with his teachers, the king with his friends, and the fallen lord with his retainers. Therefore, one with **virtue/power** over a hundred is called *juàn*#9, and one with **virtue/power** over a thousand is called *háo*#10—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of joyful harmony. One with **virtue/power** over ten thousand is called *yīng*#11—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of the outstanding in grass. The *Máo Shī Zhuan* says: *"One ten thousand is called ‘yīng’."* The *Records* say: *"Five is called ‘mào’#12, ten is called ‘xuǎn’#13, a hundred is called ‘shǐ’#14, a thousand is called ‘yīng’."* Now, this text also says that ten thousand is called *shǐ*#14 and a hundred is called *yīng*#11—this is yet more difficult to reconcile.

The *Lǐwén Zhì*#15 says: *"The most distinctive of beasts is the ‘xióng’#16, the most outstanding of plants is the ‘yīng’#17."* Hàn Xīn is the *xióng*#16, Zhāng Liáng is the *yīng*#17—this is apt.

**Virtue/power** in speech is what is called *shēng*#18—yet no speech has ever been heard where the echo surpassed the voice. The noble have wisdom, the wealthy have resources, the poor have their bodies. Without wisdom, one is lowly; without resources, one is poor. What they possess are merely the unique forms bestowed by Heaven and Earth.

To encompass all the limbs is called the *body*; to see all the features is called the *form*. If trust and oaths do not align, undertakings will not succeed. If one does not die or live, and does not make decisive judgments, how can one ever reach a conclusion? To always occupy the ground of indecision—how can this suffice to make a judgment?

To reward based on merit and to weigh **virtue/power** with authority—here lies King Fú#1. Who can wield it?

**Chapter Two: On the Rarity of the Sage**—The **Dao/Way** is measured...

With the **Dao/Way** as the core,
**Virtue/power** has its foundation.
**Virtue/power** serves as the standard.

When the sovereign does not heed the essentials,
the upright becomes routine,
and the **Dao/Way** of Yao#12 is lost—
yet the shift from non-being to being is already evident.
The **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are housed within,
yet their command remains unfulfilled.
Righteousness should be met,
yet there is no correction.

The troubles of **Sui#15** and **Sha#16** are of this kind.
*Format* means to rectify.

Because the sovereign does not heed the essentials,
then how can he be ignorant of his duties?

To abandon the meal and let it cool,
then ask for teeth—
this is no better than doing nothing.
If left as is, though it may seem secure,
it is not truly settled.
To speak of fortunate security—
one who embraces fire and rests it upon piled kindling,
then sleeps above it—
though it may not yet ignite,
it will surely burn in the end.

The upright rely on their station,
yet their titles remain unfulfilled.
Their deviation from the **Dao/Way** is profound;
what remains is but the name alone.

Thus, those who seek the people must not betray their nature,
and those who seek the world must not misalign with their guests.
In such times, those who bow to conform to customs
and look upward to flatter the times will surely arrive.

In the wilds of ritual and propriety,
they align with beasts—
though lambs and geese may have kneeling, suckling, and orderly processions,
when subjected to human norms, their wildness is abundant.
How much more so for those without such natures—
how can they be compared?

Their speech is as violent as that of barbarians.
Barbarians are those with twisted tongues.

The noble are easy to approach but difficult to familiarize,
they fear calamity and are difficult to provoke.
They die for righteousness—
thus, they are difficult to provoke.
They crave profit but do not act unjustly—
only then do they take.
They act only when moved,
and only take when necessary.
Though their bodies may be at ease,
they dare not dwell there—
only then does propriety arise.
The noble restrain themselves and return to propriety—
this is how they fulfill it.

Though their hearts may desire,
they dare not fully trust—
only then does righteousness arise.
*One variant reads:* "stand."

Trust is like entrusting—
the noble restrain themselves and embrace righteousness—
this is how they fulfill it.

Righteousness restrains desire and governs,
propriety counters nature and distinguishes—
thus, the noble do not act on impulse.

In chaotic times,
they rely on crude understanding to devise plans—
plans are subtle; how can crude intelligence grasp them?
They use mediocre tastes to discern the **Dao/Way**—
*This refers to the perverse and deceptive.*

「If one uses profit as the basis for *emotion/virtue*,
unless they do not share in the same hatred of evil,
they cannot truly be close—
but if they share in the same hatred of evil,
they will come to despise one another.
The petty-minded are so hard to approach.

When speaking of *ren* (仁),
they call it deceit;
when speaking of *righteousness* (義),
they call it boasting.
If one speaks with an honest heart and straightforwardly,
they will not believe it.
Profit blinds the mind—
one cannot reason with them like this.

Thus, the wise in chaotic times
cut off all joy and have no way to communicate,
are of different kind and have no means to convey their words,
how bitter it is!
Yet they are further harmed by it.

When the wise conceal themselves in a chaotic world,
above, they follow the ruler’s will,
below, they dare not speak truth directly.
The ruler may act in arrogance,
the people may refrain from speaking openly,
so though their hearts may not be at ease,
they dare not fail to praise.
*This echoes Yang Xiong’s* *Xian Xin* (《羡新》).
This is not something that can be done lightly and abandoned.
If one is like this yet cannot uphold *righteousness* (義) as a standard,
it is because they have the *Dao/Way* (道).

The people of Lu said:
*"Liu Xia Hui was indeed worthy, but I am not—
Confucius praised him."*
Yet if one lacks the *Dao/Way* (道),
they float like a boat in a murky world,
fawn upon superiors in servile manner,
and still wish to compare themselves to the worthy,
how confused they are!

Though their undertakings may not be virtuous,
they dare not fail to exert their utmost strength—
this is what *Ru Fen* (《汝坟》) exhorts.
Though not the *Dao/Way* (義) of *Yin Qi Lei* (《殷其雷》),
it is what they must do given their circumstances.

Though their actions may not align with propriety,
they dare not fail to comply.
If all that is within them is beyond another’s ability to change,
then even if they praise what others do not,
exert strength where others do not,
and comply where others do not—
this too is a way of adapting to the world.

Thus, observing the wise in chaotic times,
one may see them act in one way,
yet their utmost caution is not truly caution—
*caution* is better rendered as *conforming to circumstances*.
What they do is merely to avoid harm,
how could they truly be in harmony?
*This is the third chapter of* *Ye Xing* (《夜行》),
*text* (文) *is the* *Dao/Way* (文),
*earth* (地) *is* *principle* (理).」

「The moon, *punishment* (刑) *is*. *Yin* (陰) uses it to carve and restrain.
The sun, *virtue/power* (德) *is*. *Yang* (陽) uses it to reveal and awaken.

The four seasons, *examination* (检) *are*. There are clear laws yet no debate.
Measurements and numbers, *regulation* (节) *are*. Indeed, the *principle* (理) of heaven and earth lies in their measurements and numbers.

*Yin* and *Yang*, *qi* (氣) *are*. The Five *Phases* (五行), *actions* (業) *are*.
The Five *Phases* dwell in the earth and manifest form, hence called *actions*.
The Five *Officials* (五政), *Dao/Way* (道) *are*. The Five *Celestial Stems* (五辰), *Dao/Way* (道) *are*.
They reside in heaven and form *symbols* (象), hence called *Dao/Way*.

The Five *Notes* (五音), *harmony* (調) *are*.
When *sound* (聲) forms *text* (文) and *variation* (變) forms *shape* (方), it is called *Note*, hence *harmony*.
The Five *Sounds* (五聲), *custom* (故) *are*.
The Five *Sounds* differ through usage; in *Qi* (齐) they are called *Qi* (齐言), in *Jin* (晋) they are called *Jin* (晋语), hence *custom*.

The Five *Flavors* (五味), *affairs* (事) *are*.
*Rewards* and *punishments* (赏罚), *restraints* (约) *are*.
Rewards are used to restrain so that they may fulfill their duties,
punishments are used to restrain so that they may avoid blame.
These all have *verification* (验).

What has its *reason* (所以然者), when followed does not reveal its end,
when met does not reveal its beginning—
its *reason* (所以然者), *Dao/Way* (道) *is*.
The *Dao/Way* has no beginning nor end,
yet to follow its manifestations is like trying to catch the wind;
to oppose it, there is no beginning,
to comply with it, there is no end.
Even *Yan Zi* (颜子) was bewildered and could not grasp this,
how much more so the likes of *Zi Yu* (赐之流)?

When achievements and affairs are accomplished,
no one knows their *form* (状).
Who truly knows them?

*Plans* (图) cannot be fully conveyed,
*names* (名) cannot be fully expressed.
If a skillful artisan cannot depict it,
then a clever speaker cannot describe it either.

Forcing an explanation, one might say:
*Fen-hu* (茴乎) and *Mang-hu* (芒乎), within there is a *symbol* (象)?
*Mang-hu* (芒乎) and *Zi-hu* (兹乎), within there is a *thing* (物)?
*Mang* (芒) is like the *ancestral* (祖), the *poor* (贫) seem to lack it?

*Officialdom* (官乎) and *obscurity* (冥乎), within there is *refinement* (精乎).
To *attain sincerity* (致信) and *investigate principle* (究情),

the *Dao/Way*, indeed has *principle* (情) and *sincerity* (信),
not like *emptiness* (断空).
Though it lacks form, it is not without *principle* (理);
its essence lies in *governance* (政) and must be investigated.

*Returning* (复反) has no *appearance* (貌).
If *appearance* (貌) is already absent,
how much more so *form* (形)?
*Ghosts* (鬼) cannot see what cannot be done by humans,
*dew* (露) then lacks *spiritual potency* (神),
how could they suffice to establish achievements and affairs?

Thus, those who skillfully perform human *actions* (業) are subtle,
mysterious—
even *ghosts* (鬼) cannot peer into their secrets.
Hence, the *Sages* (圣人) value *Ye Xing* (夜行).

Heaven, the fourth.
The *Sage Kings* (圣王者), have the *Dao/Way* of listening to the subtle
and resolving doubts,
able to *block out slander* (屏谗权实),
to *oppose false speech* (逆淫辞),
such as the followers of *Yang* (杨) and *Mo* (墨).
They sever *common talk* (绝流语),」

The followers of Guan and Cai must be dismissed.
Abandon what is useless—
the skill of slaying dragons, the art of carving *zhu* (楮),
though praised as lofty and wondrous, are of no practical use.

Close the gates of factions and cliques,
those who hoard wealth to curry favor, betraying the public for private gain—
let their schemes wither like stagnant water,
their empty words fade like fleeting whispers.
How could such be tolerated?

The envious and the bold shall not gain prominence;
let them remain in obscurity.
Only the virtuous and the upright may stand before the throne,
thus evil cannot deceive, and calamity cannot strike.

Heaven and Earth abide by the boundless,
guarding measure and limit without excess—
this is the meaning of *"evil cannot deceive, calamity cannot strike."*

The sun does not deviate from its appointed hour;
the conjunction of sun and moon forms the *chen* (辰).
The moon occupies its listed station—
speaking of its sequence in the *chen*.

When the name is invoked, the duty is fulfilled:
if named *Ji* (箕), then perform the duties of *Ji*;
if named *Dou* (斗), then perform the duties of *Dou*—
and so on for the rest.

The stars remain steadfast in their domains,
each confined to its proper territory.
The phases of *xian* (弦) and *wang* (望), *hui* (晦) and *suo* (朔),
cycle endlessly, one following the other—
some texts read *"selected"* (选).
The earth’s fields yield harvests, completing *hui* and *suo*,
while the moon wanes and waxes, forming *xian* and *wang*—
repeating in endless succession, like the turning of a millstone or the pull of a saw.
How could there ever be an end?

The year accumulates into decades—
a year yields one harvest of grain,
while a decade spans two full cycles of abundance.
Its use is solemn, not lax or careless—
*manman* (缦缦) is the appearance of fading and extinction.

This is the celestial grasp by which Heaven rules over the *Dou* [Fight/Constellation]—
or, as some texts read, *calculates* it.
It speaks of the *Dou* governing the four quarters,
moving through the four seasons, eternal without end,
while Heaven’s Way, as previously stated, shifts its dominion accordingly.

The *San* [Three] intermingles to form its station—
some texts read *Wu* [Five], others *Five*.
It speaks of the *San* harmonizing with Heaven and Earth to establish its station within.

The Four *Qi* [Energies] govern as ministers,
their laws following the four seasons.
*Zhang* [Extending] precedes, *Ji* [Polar] follows—
*Zhang*, the star of the Southern Quarter;
*Ji*, the star of the Northern Quarter.
Sometimes *Zhang* is named, sometimes *Ji*—
they mutually embrace each other.

*Jiao* [Horn] on the left, *Tie* [Iron] on the right—
some texts read *Yue* [Jade].
*Jiao*, the star of the Eastern Quarter;
*Tie*, the star of the Western Quarter.
The *San* strikes down *Yǔ* [Axe] and *Tie* [Iron].
The Nine Patterns follow their natural order,
to inspect the officials of the realm—
great and small, all accounted for.
This is to say: concise yet nothing is omitted.

Before, there is no grievance of *Tiao* [Condemnation],
after, no blame of ruined reputation and failed conduct—
thus its authority reaches above and below, intersecting.
Some texts read *Jiao* [Cross-examining].
Its blessings spread in all four directions without obstruction.
Eastward it extends, westward it covers,
northward it reaches—
abundant and unstoppable, none can resist it.

Heaven’s non-deviation lies in its adherence to *One*;
this is called *trending toward things without duality*.
If Heaven departs from *One*, it reverses to become *things*.
What distinguishes Heaven from all things is its embrace of *One*.

*The Zijié* [Character Explanation] says:
*One* yet vast is Heaven;
*Two* yet small is *Shì* [This].
It neither creates nor acts,
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth in *virtue/power*,
constantly aiding the natural self-so of all things without daring to interfere—
Heaven does not create, yet all things transform;
Earth does not act, yet all things nurture.

The *Zhì* [Seal] and *Xìn* [Trust] are reliable,
like the moon responding to the sun—
the sun advances and retreats along the stars,
the moon lives and dies in response to the sun—
this is the utmost of trust.
This is how the Sage governs the world.

Knowledge suffices to smooth what is correct,
brevity suffices to avoid calamity—
this is why a perilous state cannot be secured,
a ruined state cannot be restored.

Strength suffices to repel enemies,
eloquence suffices to adorn deceit—
this is why corruption cannot be cured.

Thus, Heaven’s Way first values the *covered*—
Heaven can only cover those who are covered;
if they cut themselves off, even Heaven cannot act.
Earth’s Way first values the *borne*—
Earth can only bear those who are borne;
if they abandon themselves, even Earth cannot act.
Human Way first values the *served*—
as Gōuxià Jì said:
*"A son who does not heed his father’s command,
a younger brother who does not receive his elder’s teaching—
even if you were to bind him with ropes,
what could you do?"*

*Selling wine* [or, as some texts read, *borrowing*] first values the *fed*—
the wine-seller is an example.
This further illustrates Heaven’s valuing of the *covered*,
Earth’s valuing of the *borne*,
and humanity’s valuing of the *served*.

*Dài* [Attending] to things—
some texts read *Lǐng* [Leading] or *Gù* [Observing]—
*qi* [energies] at their proper times.
The Four Seasons each lead the *qi* of their quarter.

Life and death are the law.
Following the measure to decide—
this is Heaven’s *jié* [node].
Things cannot be left entirely unrestrained,
so the measure is consulted.
Nature and fate are the natural *jié*.
The land is ordered and guarded,
the people are divided and assigned—
some texts read *zhǐ* [stopped].
Thus, the Sage follows Heaven’s *jié*,
consulting the measure to decide,
so the land each has its guardian,
the people each have their allotment.

The cold receive clothing,
the hungry receive food,
the wronged receive justice,
the weary receive rest—
this is what the Sage aspires to.

To cut cloth and know how to choose the artisan,
to govern a state and know how to select its people—
this is indeed what all ages recognize.

As when weaving silk and teaching someone to cut it—
the result is inevitable.

Only through *same* can Heaven be seen—
Heaven’s Way is *One* without *Two*,
so when viewed from their sameness,
*Yí* and *Mò* are of one family.

Only through *different* can humanity be seen—
Human Way is *Two* without *One*,
so when viewed from their difference,
the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue.

Only through *change* can time be seen—
constantly moving without pause.

「To observe *change* is how one may perceive the **Dao/Way**—the **Gēngsāngzǐ** says: A **Yue** chicken cannot brood a **Hú** goose or a **Ru** cock, yet a **Ru** chicken can; when the **Zhào** traveler goes south to see **Lǎozǐ**, then the **Dao/Way’s** hierarchical distinctions are revealed.

Only when facing profit can one perceive **truthfulness/faith (xìn)**, only when facing wealth can one perceive **benevolence/ren (rén)**, only when facing danger can one perceive **courage (yǒng)**. Under severe frost and fierce winds, one may then distinguish the true nature of grasses and trees.

Only when encountering matters can one perceive **guardians and officials (wèishù zhī shì)**.

The **Nine Sovereigns (Jiǔ Huáng)**’s system, as the *Spring and Autumn Annals’ Commentary (Chūnqiū Wěi)* states: The **Human Sovereign (Rén Huáng)** had nine brothers who ruled the world together.
Are the **Nine Sovereigns’** titles truly derived from this?

The **Sovereign (Zhǔ)** does not falsely confer **kingship (wáng)**, for their **virtue/power (dé)** is complete.
The **minister (Chén)** does not falsely receive **nobility (guì)**—the ranks and titles are awarded without omission.
**High and low (Zūn bēi)** are defined by their **names and titles (mínghào)**.
This refers to the **humble** in **high** titles.

From the **lords, officials, and commoners (jūn lì mín)**, each **lord, official, and commoner** governs their own.
Those of lesser rank have no **state (guó)**, so they are sent to administer it.
**Alternating favors and records (Lì chǒng lì lù)**, records here mean **literary and official distinctions (wénjiàn zhī mào)**.
It speaks of **cycling through bestowal and honor**, their splendor changing accordingly.
The *Mao’s Commentary on the Shijing (Máo Shī Zhuàn)* says: **To hold and record**—this is the meaning.

**Harmonizing with Heaven and humanity (Yǔ tiān rén cān xiàng jiēlián)**, Heaven and humanity are **unified (yī guàn)** and cannot be separated.
The **tools of governance (gōumòi)** are incomplete because of this.

**Hooks and chains (Gōu mòi)**—the **means of supervision and discipline (dūzé zhī wèi)**—are absent.
It means that **only through the Dao/Way’s transformative influence (hùadào)** without coercive measures can such harmony be achieved.
Thus it is said: **Burn them, probe them, carve them, bind them**, and **three-fourths of the horses will die**.
The **nature of horses (mǎ zhī xìng)** is inherently true, yet their **wisdom becomes deceitful and thievish (zhì dào guǐ qiè zhě)**, this is the fault of the **Master Horse Trainer (Bólé)**.

Though so, the **Nine Sovereigns’** system is also **allegorical (yùyán)**—the **Supreme Sovereign (Tàishàng)** governs without laws, how could there be a system of conferring titles?
Those who **grasp the principles (Qièlǐ zhī shì)**, **focus on their convergence (yào qí huì guī)** and **abandon their external forms (ér yí suǒ jì)**, is acceptable.

The **flaws of the lower realm (xià zhī suǒ wǔ)**,

The contradictions arise from obstruction—**dry** (gān) in speech.

When the **Highest** can be obscured, this is where one strays from human sentiment and loses the **Heavenly Principle** (tiān jié).

To slacken is to exhaust, to press is to constrain—when opportunity arises, one counters with the **unexpected** (qí), this is human nature.

To **distress** (dá) the nature of things: slackness breeds negligence, haste breeds constraint.

Thus the ancient sages’ parable of **driving chickens** warns against **excessive urgency** (jí nà).

**"Question"** (wèn) refers to **flags and gaps** (zhì xì).

When the **bars are locked tight**, even with the most cunning schemes, how could one breach them?

Since the **Heavenly Principle** has been discussed above, here we elaborate on human sentiment.

To **uphold the Eight Extremes** (bā jí) with **trust yet skepticism**—this is the **Heavenly Pattern** (tiān zhī zé).

The **Eight Extremes** are the utmost reaches of the eight directions. The **four corners** are the four angles.

*The Huainanzi* says: Beyond the eight **gaps** (yán) lie the eight **strings** (xián), beyond the eight **knots** (jié) lie the eight extremes.

Though the **Eight Extremes** exist, yet by **traces that do not reach**, they seem like **empty boasts**—thus it is said: *"trust yet do not trust."*

Still, observing from **suspended metaphor**, the eight directions—above and below—are **boundless**, yet also **not without bound**, and **not without extremity**, hence it is called the **Heavenly Pattern**.

**"Difference and error"**—speaking of what cannot be reconciled.

The **Dao of Confucius and Mozi** both **observed** the **Sages Yao and Shun**, yet **condemned** the **tyrants Jie and Zhou**, yet ultimately could not be reconciled—this flaw stems from here.

**Flatness not aligning with pitch**. Even if **level**, if it fails to meet the **standard pitch**, it is off.

A **thousand-li misstep** originates from a **hair’s breadth error**; yet over **years of neglect**, the mistake lies in **fleeting moments**.

Thus the **Noble One** is cautious of the small.

When the **moon is full**, yet dawn arrives—when the **moon is eclipsed**, the **pearls and clams** rise from the depths, the **water channels form shallows**.

Above and below are **both estranged**.

It is said that **like qi** adheres to **estrangement** without question—even though **beasts hide in deep pools**, their rise and fall mirror the moon’s waxing and waning, as if governed from above.

*The Huainanzi* says: When the sun reaches its zenith, **deer and elk shed their antlers**; when the moon is eclipsed, **pearls and clams ascend**.

Before the command is given, their actions are known; before the order is issued, their movement is foreseen. The **Sovereign does not exert effort**, yet the people act with **spontaneous perfection**—this is the **standard of transformation**.

If ordered yet they do not go, if forbidden yet they do not stop, when **above and below are misaligned**, their **Dao cannot harmonize**.

When the **Sovereign above** is **harsh** (xié) and the **people below** are **oppressed**, this is the **corruption of the masses**.

When **Yin and Yang fail to interact**, their **principles cannot reach each other**.

When **calculations are mismatched**, the people **do not respond to the Sovereign**.

Without **matching talismans and seals**, how could they ever align?

To **act without harm**, to **achieve without failure**, when **one leads and ten thousand respond**, like **the body following the mind—this is the standard of governance**.

Just as **a single lever** (gāng) moves **all the spokes**, its **essence lies in unity**.

Just as **a single pole** (gāng) lifts **all the beams**, its **essence lies in the pole itself**.

Thus the **Enlightened Sovereign** favors **unity**, using **one to lead ten thousand**.

Because it **binds the beams with silk** (jǐn) to the pole, it is called the **"silk-pole"** (jǐngāng).

*The Erya* says: **"Plain silk binds the pole."**

Yet **seeing without understanding** cannot **remove one’s ailments**.

When **Wen and Wu** alternate in governance yet **fail to implement reality**, it is because **laws are issued yet not enforced**.

**"Urgent"** (niè) refers to **capital punishment**.

This is when **laws are ineffective**, and **the petty dare to act corruptly without restraint**.

Though **Qin relied on harsh scrutiny**, its **flaws were mere formalities**, yet it collapsed into **total ruin**, worse than having **no laws at all**, because it lacked **true compassion and urgency**.

From this, it is seen: **Without inner sincerity and genuine urgency**, to **enforce everything through law** is to **verify authenticity**—yet this only **breeds deceit**. To **examine governance** is to **invite chaos**.

To **abandon this and cling to that**—how could it ever succeed?

**Southward bound yet steering north**.

To **obscure the yellow** (míng) yet speak as if easy—**speech without action is difficult**.

Thus **fathers cannot command sons**, nor **Sovereigns command ministers**.

Even in **ruler-subject, parent-child relationships**, this is so—**how much more for the lowly?**

We have already seen **how Heaven’s trust in things** operates.

**Heaven’s Dao is without deceit**.

We have not yet seen **how humans trust in things**.

Unable to **conform to speech**.

**Discarding things and relying on force**—this is **Heaven’s way**.

All things are **exhausted**; it **relies solely on force**.

**Discarding things and relying on force**—*"discarding"* may also be read as *"damaging"*.

Thus **none can govern without premature decline**.

Alternatively: **"Obtaining the first"**—this is the **principle of the Dao**.

Because it **discards things and relies on force**, none can govern without **premature decline**.

Its **Dao is as above**, thus none can govern without **all declining**.

**"Things"**—because **the crooked can be straightened**, and **people can be directed**.

It is said: **If things are merely things**, there is **no end to this**—thus **Heaven’s unchangeability** is made clear.

**Heaven’s Dao** **patterns things yet does not claim them**.

Though **laws vary in kind**, when **measured against Heaven’s Dao**, how could they **ever suffice**?

**Temporarily adapting to the world** is all—**this is far from self-assured**.

For those who merely serve as loyal ministers offering counsel, they are not to be relied upon.
This is because their influence extends only to the existence of laws.
Thus, laws are **artificial regulations**—**artificially imposed measures**.
Officials are established to fulfill the ruler’s needs.
Each official guards their duties to fulfill the ruler’s needs.
Promoting the virtuous is not done through official ranks,
Nor is it done by concealing the bright to elevate others.
Only when their merit is evident is it then recognized.
Exposing faults is not done in secret,
Nor is it done by concealing others’ errors—
only when their guilt is manifest is punishment then applied.

This is the **true value of law**.
If laws are ignored, even if rewards are lavished,
there will still be those who fail to respond.
Those who bestow rewards seek to sharpen the dull instruments of the world,
yet rewards cannot fully motivate,
punishments cannot fully deter,
and if laws are disregarded and not enforced,
or if punishments fall on the innocent,
then it is like demanding results from unused grinding stones—
even if jade and silk are offered in abundance,
there will still be those who fail to respond.

When ruler and subjects are divided,
defenses arise, and mutual obstruction follows.
If measures are set to weigh things,
then both the scales and the weights are stolen;
if measures are set to measure things,
then both the measuring tools and the goods are stolen.
Thus, governance falls into private hands and cannot be reclaimed,
while officials wield power arbitrarily and cannot be restrained,
rewards are given to the undeserving and cannot be revoked,
laws are abandoned and cannot be reinstated,
and punishments are meted out unjustly and cannot be stopped—
this is because they are not shared with the people.
If governance is shared with the people,
and ruler and subjects uphold the Dao in harmony,
how could it ever reach such a state?

A leak in the roof is known by those below,
a leak in the boat is known by those above.
To make the people abandon self-interest and instead focus on the ruler’s intentions—
this is what proper teaching aspires to.
Even the **Eight Extremes** cannot always be praised in time,
thus they may be obstructed.
What is called **"unobstructed"** is the **Four Openings and Six Directions**—
how could one doubt that the **Eight Extremes** cannot be praised in clarity?
This is like Tang’s inquiry at Ji.

In the past, those who governed with the Dao did not rely on their ears and eyes.
Through divine intuition—**the vague yet profound, the descending yet ascending**—
they questioned beyond the **Eight Extremes**,
so that what was before their ears could not be heard,
and what was beyond their walls could not be seen.
Thus, the sage’s governance relied on the Dao,
not on ears and eyes.
The ears govern hearing, the eyes govern sight—
a single leaf obscures the view, and the great mountain is unseen;
two beans block the ears, and thunder is unheard.
Even the smallest things can obstruct perception—
how can they be trusted?

When the Dao is open, there is no obstruction—
this has never been heard of.
This proves the Dao’s reliability.
When the Dao is open,
clouds and mist cannot hinder vision,
thunder cannot disrupt hearing—
even if the ruler holds a gnat’s antenna before his eyes,
he sees it as vast as the slopes of Mount Song,
and if he listens to the clash of shells,
he hears it as the tumult of the armies of Qi and Wei.
Who could obstruct this?

To see what is abandoned without taking it—
this is not human nature.
It is said: **"There is no such thing."**

This too has never been heard of—what more can be said?

When trust in emotions and adherence to the Way are cultivated, it is not the work of Heaven’s punishment, nor does it defy the fate of humankind. To act against one’s nature is to fail in one’s duty. Without fear of Heaven’s calamities, human misfortunes, or perilous fate, yet still pursuing life as if it were a task—this is like an ant trying to wear a mountain as a crown. How could it bear such a burden?

Those who seek success and gain are merely pursuing what they hope for. If success comes from Heaven, it is called fate; if not, it is called destiny—there is nothing else to rely on. This is the Way, not mere action. To act for the people is the essence of the Way. What the people are not yet at ease with, the Sage does not force upon them; what the people are not yet weary of, the Sage does not remove. Only when the people reach their limit does the Sage not intervene.

He who relies on others without taking responsibility himself—this is Heaven’s way. If the people truly reach their limit, how could the Sage overstep and take their place?

The Grand Tutor said: *"Let the people cultivate the virtuous, and appoint leaders to guide them; let the people cultivate their abilities, and let others govern them."* This is how the Sage King transmits his teachings, preserving the institutions of governance.

If teaching is harsh, the people’s conduct becomes shallow. If discipline begins only after childhood, it is too late. Losing sight of the roots, they contend over the branches. Fish vanish from the rivers and lakes, yet they still quarrel in the muddy shallows.

Humans have their place in their dwelling, dwellings have their place on the land, each with its own domain. The land has its place under Heaven, and the land is vast. Heaven has its place in time—like the early cold of Qin or the early heat of Chu. Time has its place in the numbers—like spring aligning with the Wood phase or autumn with the Metal phase. The numbers have their place in measurement—extending the many or shortening the few. Measurement has its place in unity.

Unity is the origin of measurement and numbers, adapting to their divisions. It is like the moon illuminating all waters. Heaven, though high, has its lowly ears—this is why. Heaven’s body is vast, yet its ears are even lower, for its spirit pervades all things universally. Thus, the Sage King follows Heaven’s timing, and the people follow the land’s order. There is no idle skill, and effort yields much.

The Three Powers converge to make a king—this is drawn from here. Revering the ruler and humbling the subjects is not about favoring kin. Appointing the worthy and employing the capable is not about personal preference. It is about maintaining the old ways. Words should not abandon public justice for private favor.

Water and fire do not mix—this is Heaven’s decree. Water and fire serve as metaphors for favor and justice. In ancient governance, when private favor was extreme, public justice could not be overridden; when public justice was extreme, private favor could not interfere. Like water and fire, they aid each other yet do not blend.

Still, this is merely human conduct. As for Heaven’s Way, it lies beyond this realm. Hence, it is said:

The enlightened cannot illuminate what is already bright—this is why the blind man Li Zhu could not grasp it. The Way cannot be obtained.

The compass cannot encircle what is already complete—this is why strength cannot lift it. Though Heaven and Earth may subtly shift, their true essence remains. It is not like a boat in the night being carried away by currents—who could lift it?

When wisdom arises from self-awareness, wisdom arises. To turn jade into a broken ring is to make governance slippery. Uncarved jade does not shatter—why would it become a broken ring? A ring is a half-circle.

*The Rites* say: *"Severing with a half-ring, then reuniting with a full ring."* Fields cannot flourish without adapting to the land’s shape. Rice thrives in lowlands, millet in uplands. Governance cannot transform the people without adapting to their customs. Excessive severity or leniency, inappropriate joy or anger—these four, when extreme, are not the Sage’s method. Though they differ, they all stray far from the Great Way. How could they claim the Sage’s seat?

*The Liezi* says: *"To hold onto them all is to be swayed by them."* The body, though restrained, still causes greater chaos, for form and influence do not govern each other. If form cannot restrain influence, and influence cannot restrain form, this is their ruin.

Virtue and life are intertwined in existence and decay—this cannot be the standard. The bones of Yao and Shun have long decayed, yet they are still sung of today. Is it because their bodies endure? This is the law of the ten thousand ages.

Those who govern the world have never separated themselves from Heaven or been without Heaven’s mandate while still benefiting the people. To benefit the people is to benefit the land. Heaven and humanity do not act independently—humanity without Heaven does not succeed, nor does Heaven without humanity. To deviate from Heaven and humanity is to fail in self-governance, let alone governing the world.

The Sage Kings’ great names were never established without the scholars’ contributions. It is Heaven that elevates them. Excess arises from above, punishment from below—this is how corrupt ages become commonplace.

Ah, how brief is life! This is the limit of fate. These are words of lament, saying that fate has reached its peak in the ruler. Now, with such a dire situation, how can it not be mourned?

The deeper the sorrow, the more restrained the words—this is the poet’s art.

*[Environmental shift: The text transitions to a new section, "Environmental Flow" (环流第五)]*

There is One and there is qi—

The One is the origin of the Primordial Qi.

Qi exists, and with it, *yi*—
*Yi* is born from the undifferentiated Qi.
With *yi*, there are patterns—
which can be mirrored.
With patterns, there are names—
which can be spoken.
With names, there are forms;
with forms, there are affairs;
with affairs, there are regulations—
these eight aspects are complete,
yet the undifferentiated remains unseparated—
this is what is called *Hun Dun*.

Regulations take center and give rise to time;
time gives rise, now acting, now establishing.
The next stage is speech—
to distinguish.
When established, things are born.
*Hun Dun* is now opened,
and thus the Four Seasons move,
and all things are born.

Hence, qi accumulates to form time,
regulations accumulate to form periods,
periods accumulate to form deeds,
deeds accumulate to form gain and loss,
gain and loss accumulate to form auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,
all things accumulate to form victory and defeat—
all originate from qi,
and qi is what makes them manifest.
They are in accord with the Dao,
and the Dao is what makes them accord.
They are constrained by affairs,
and knowing the Dao while #26 then becomes chaotic.
They are aligned with time,
and knowing affairs alone leads to error.

When *li* is separated, it becomes mixed with names—
*li* as in the *li* of "detachment."
It is perfected in law.
Law that is here is called *near*,
its transformation beyond is called *far*.
Near and reaching completion is called *shen* (divine),
clarity in the Dao is *shen*,
and *shen* in things is clarity.
Far and returning is called clarity.
As Laozi said:
*"The passing day is distant, distant returns."*
Clarity is here,
its light illuminating or revealing there;
its affairs form here,
its deeds complete there.

The *Odes* say: *"Hold the reins like a rope."* This is what is meant.

To make a rope, one gathers the threads here and weaves the pattern there.
It speaks of movement in the near and action in the far.

Confucius said: *"The one who composed this ode must have understood governance!*
To hold this law and govern the people—how could there not be transformation?"

The sincere warning of *Ganxián* is profound.
From this to that is law.
The one who generates law is *I* (the Sage).
Without *I*, there would be no law.
The one who fulfills law is *them* (the people).
Without *them*, there would be no use for law.
The one who generates law is the sun, ever present without surfeit.
The circulation of spirit-qi follows the sun’s renewal each day.
To generate and fulfill within oneself—this is the Sage.
*I* and *them* are mysteriously one; the utmost of virtue.

Only the Sage exhausts the nature of the Dao,
only the Dao’s law.
If not truly the primal chaos, who could do this?

Public governance is illuminated.
When the Dipper’s handle points east, all under heaven is spring.
When it points south, all under heaven is summer.
When it points west, all under heaven is autumn.
When it points north, all under heaven is winter.
The Dipper’s handle moves above, and affairs are established below.
When the Dipper points to one direction, all four quarters are harmonized.
This is the Dao’s application of law—
the ancient Sages governed the world without leaving their seats,
their complexions like polished cinnabar, their skin like ice and snow—
this is the use of the Dao.

Yet the world’s withered ones take this as yellow,
claiming Yellow Emperor’s skin was smooth and instructive,
while Yao and Shun were pale like dried meat—
this is Mozi’s doctrine.

Thus, the sun and moon are insufficient to speak of brightness,
the four seasons insufficient to speak of function.
Their brightness and function surpass the four seasons and the sun and moon.
One law is established to complete its work—
thus all follow the Dao.
The people all use it.
One law is set, and all things come to belong to it.
Because it arises from One, all things cannot be divided.
Law is precious as speech.
Without trust, it cannot stand.
Speech is the root of all things.
*Is* is what law holds close;
*Non-is* is what law rejects.
*Is* is close to law, hence strong;
*Non-is* is distant from law, hence perishes.
If law does not conform to speech, it disrupts its root.

Thus, the one who generates law is *ming* (fate);
the one generated by law is also *ming*.
All is *ming*.
*Ming* is natural.
None can make it so, nor can any prevent it—
this is called natural.
What *ming* establishes, the virtuous do not necessarily gain,
the unworthy do not necessarily lose.
*Ming* says:
Pengzu’s wisdom did not surpass Yao and Shun’s,
yet he lived a hundred years;
Yan Yuan’s talent did not exceed the common man’s,
yet he died at eighteen;
Confucius’ virtue did not fall below the feudal lords’,
yet he was困 in Chen and Cai;
Zhou’s cruelty did not fall below the Three Virtuous Ones’,
yet he held the throne.
This is what is meant.

*Ming* is the father who lifts one from the grasslands to the floating honors above.
Yet bowing and rising a hundred years—
it is fleeting, like a dream.
This is *wen* (pattern), not reality.
Thus there is the *ming* of a day,
the *ming* of a year,
the *ming* of a season,
the *ming* of a lifetime.
The *ming* of a lifetime is never fully realized.
Thus *ming* is everywhere, everywhere applied, everywhere sufficient.
It is said: *"There is no place without *ming*, no time without *ming*."*
If delayed in time yet obtained, it is *ming*.
Since there is *ming* in time,
time is the movement of Heaven,
*ming* is Heaven’s decree.
The *South华* says:
*"To avoid ruin for long is futile—one cannot escape *ming*;
to seek passage for long is futile—one cannot find the time."*
To draw forth its resonance and align it with its name—
if in accord with time, it is called *tiao* (harmony);
if out of time, spirit and qi perish together—
this is called *kuai* (contrariness).
Though the vessel’s interior is the same,
if a homely man presents it, its ugliness is only increased.
Only the Sage can regulate time and *ming*.
The *South华* says:
*"To know when to seek passage and when ruin is fated,
to face great peril without fear—this is the Sage’s courage."*

Though the ancient kings’ Dao was complete,
yet the world has troubled rulers—
their loss lies in this.
Rites, propriety, law, and measures adapt to the times;
time and *ming* do not cease, and law follows accordingly.
Yet the ignorant cling to the past like a girded pillar or a carved boat,
guarding the ancient kings’ remnants—
though their Dao is complete,
they only deepen their困 and ruin.
This is like resting on a dog of straw outside the gate
and then encountering a nightmare—
how could it be easy to endure?

Thus the so-called Dao is without *ji* (self) and without *ji* (self again);
it is only to follow.
The so-called *de* is the ability to obtain others—
yet it does not lose oneself.
The law of Dao and *de* is what all things take as their work,
the so-called resource without depletion.
Formless yet apportioned—
its name is *Da* (Great Thickness).
Unknown whose child it is.
Thus the Dao of east, west, south, and north
stands uniformly in its divisions.
The *South华* says:
*"To know the opposition of east and west yet not reject them—
then the apportionment of function is fixed."*

Yin and yang differ in qi,
yet their harmony is the same.
Sour and bitter, sweet and bitter tastes oppose,
yet their goodness is balanced.
The *South华* says:
*"The pear and the loquat, their flavors oppose,
yet both are pleasing to the mouth.
The five colors differ in hue,
yet their beauty is uniform.
The five tones differ in pitch,
yet their joy is one."*

These five things illustrate the ancient kings’ Dao:
not proud of uniformity but proud of governance.
Thus no thing lacks its kind,
no motion or stillness lacks qi.
Therefore, if one person’s *jiang* (endeavor) succeeds,
one person’s qi is auspicious;

There is a household general—one who governs a household.
If he succeeds, the household’s qi is auspicious;
there is a national general—one who governs a nation.
If he succeeds, the nation’s qi is auspicious.

The ancients said: War is like gambling—
abundant resources make one’s qi bold and victorious,
scarce resources make one’s heart timid and lead to defeat.
Thus, the general’s fortune or misfortune rests in qi.

The *Art of War* says:
Morning qi is sharp,
noon qi is slack,
evening qi returns.
A skilled commander avoids its sharpness and strikes when it is slack and returning.

If the general’s fortune is reversed,
then *same* is called *one*,
*different* is called *Dao*,
*mutual overcoming* is called *executing*,
*fortune and misfortune* are called *success and failure*.

The virtuous—though ten thousand actions yield one failure—
the unworthy—though ten thousand actions yield one success—
yet their aspirations are not the same.
Thus, what they do cannot be uniform.
Knowing that *one* cannot be uniform,
therefore, *Dao* is prized.
*Different* is called *Dao*.

*Empty* is called *one* [or *same*],
*empty* [or *same*] is called *one*.
All things have no lack.
No lack of completeness is called *Dao*.
All things have no excess.
*Establishing* is called *qi*,
*communicating* is called *kind*.

Qi that harms people is called *inappropriate*,
flavor that harms people is called *poison*.

The *community altar*—originally *Heaven’s altar*,
or *Heaven’s Du*—if not carved, then no mist forms.
*Du* means *reaching*—
this speaks of a ruined kingdom’s altar not receiving Heaven’s sun,
thus lacking mist.
Great altars are not housed but are platforms,
to receive frost and dew’s qi,
then mist arises.

Properly speaking, *altar* and *mist*—
*altar* establishes *qi*’s meaning,
*mist* communicates *kind*’s meaning.
Qi thus mutually benefits and harms.
Duke Zhou’s *Tuning* says:
Yin and yang mutually illuminate,
mutually shelter and regulate;
the four seasons mutually succeed,
mutually generate and destroy.

Kinds thus mutually complete and ruin.
Summer is spring’s kind;
winter is autumn’s kind.
All others follow this.

*Accumulated past* generates *differences*—
craftsmen take them as models.
*Differences* means *limping*—
models are like shamans’ models.
Shamans walk with a limp,
so accumulated past generates *differences*,
craftsmen take them as models.

Yangzi said:
In ancient times, the Sì clan governed water and land,
and shamans imitated Yu’s gait;
Biàn Que was from Lu,
and physicians imitated Lu’s ways.
Accumulated poison becomes medicine,
craftsmen take them as physicians.
This speaks of medicine’s origins arising,
then physicians emerge.

Generally, the world’s flaws arise from past precedents,
so great thieves borrow righteousness to steal a nation,
petty scholars use poetry and ritual to enrich their families.
Thus it is said:
How do we know that Zēng and Shǐ were not spies for Jiè and Yòu?

Good and evil adorn each other—
this is called *reciprocal completeness*.
Things pushed to extremes reverse—
this is called *cyclic flow*.
Speaking of its circulation like an unbroken ring.

**Chapter Six: The Dao’s End**

Heaven is what allows all things to stand.
All things depend on it to exist—this is Heaven.
Earth is what allows all things to rest.
Heaven is the Father of the Dao,
Earth is the Mother of the Dao.
Thus Heaven ordains it,
Earth arranges it,
Time activates it,
Things receive it,
Sages emulate it.

The changes of cold and warmth
are not the work of a single essence alone;
the five essences transform into qi,
then cold and heat are formed.

The affairs of the world
are not what one person can know alone;
the vast waters
are not the flow of a single stream alone.
Yáo’s nine-year floods did not increase the waters,
Táng’s seven-year droughts did not decrease them—
was it because he relied on a single stream’s measure?

Thus, the enlightened ruler’s governance
urgently seeks people,
does not act alone,
but shares with them.
Sharing with Heaven and Earth,
also sharing with Heaven and Earth.

Establishing the four supports—
*ritual, righteousness, kindness, and shame*—
these are called the four supports,
to assist national governance.

Hooks and lines spread out,
cornerstones and plumb lines regulate,
balanced in their arrangements,
positions then become firm.

Qi has its constants,
ordered by Heaven and Earth.
Acting contrary to seasonal times brings misfortune,
disasters arise,
affairs fail without virtuous officials.
Exhaust its Dao externally,
probe its changes internally.

Deploying armies to guard the borders,
disaster returns within—
as when Ji Sūn’s worry was not in Zhuántú,
but within the inner walls.

What is prepared is distant,
the enemy lies in what is cherished.

Thus, the ancient kings appointed officials—
selecting the virtuous, employing the capable,
without partiality toward the world.
The benevolent man stands at left,
spring generates life—symbolizing benevolence.
The loyal minister stands before,
the south is visible—symbolizing loyalty.
The righteous minister stands at right,
autumn completes—symbolizing righteousness.
The sage stands behind,
the north is secret—symbolizing sagacity.

Left follows benevolence, then spring generates;
before follows loyalty, then summer’s achievements stand;
right follows righteousness, then autumn’s harvest matures;
behind follows sagacity, then winter’s concealment is complete.

The ancient kings used them,
elevated yet not fallen,
secure yet not ruined.
This is the root of all things,
Heaven and Earth’s gateway.

The four great ministers—
the king’s external appointments.
The king is Heaven.
Left, right, before, and behind follow the four seasons,
thus the king emulates Heaven.

If Heaven does not open its gateway,
it allows harm below.
West does not follow righteousness,
south does not follow loyalty,
north does not follow sagacity,
then Heaven’s gateway is sealed.

Advancing the virtuous earns supreme reward,
then those below do not conceal the good.

The *Hall of Literature* quotes *The Crow’s Crown*:
“Advancing the virtuous earns supreme reward,
then those below do not conceal the good.”

For those who govern, rewards are few yet the people rejoice,
punishments are few yet the people stand in awe.
This is called advancing those already in office who are virtuous.

They do not wait for the meritorious deeds of those who serve well—
though they are not yet proven in service—
to promote and reward them,
then those entrusted with affairs will be encouraged.

Thus the following text states:
*"Then those entrusted with affairs will not fail to give their utmost loyalty."*

*The Profound Dew* says:
"One act of loyalty is loyalty itself;
a second act is called *xi* (cessation)."
The common folk admire righteousness,
the states and kingdoms take delight in it—
this is clear.

When governance is upright, even flies do not covet rotten meat,
yet ants are drawn to rancid flesh.
Thus, though others may admire righteousness,
our governance must itself be upright.

When governance is upright,
it means the ruler’s demeanor is correct,
facing south in reverence.
This is the Way’s fulfillment,
virtue’s completion.

Its origin lies in One—
thus it is called *Heaven*.
There is no second sovereign.
All receive their mandate,
unable to be named—
thus it is called *Spirit*.
It subtly permeates all things and is called *speech*.

At the utmost of Spirit,
it is seen without force.
*(One text reads: "or.")*
Those who align with this Way—
how could they differ?

The *Xiongnu* rebels are undeterred,
yet they strive to govern a single state.
When calamities strike,
they are not dismayed—
merely examining the great principles of the world
to rectify their own nation’s errors.
Who says that Heaven’s changes belong to a certain event,
or that my actions caused them?

The punishments of a single state
are all embodied in the ruler’s person.
Punishments begin with a minor wife,
extending to brothers,
to govern the family and state.

The ruler ages by governing the world,
to save the world and then age.
Correcting with precision,
embracing righteousness and practicing benevolence,
to unify the king’s domain.

Benevolence is the ruler’s essence;
righteousness, the ruler’s conduct;
loyalty, the ruler’s governance;
truth, the ruler’s teaching;
the Sage, the ruler’s mentor and tradition.

The ruler’s Way lies in knowing people,
the minister’s art in knowing affairs.
Thus, when handling wealth and distributing resources, use benevolence;
when facing danger or crisis, employ courage;
when receiving words and articulating speech, rely on eloquence;
when deliberating and deciding, depend on wisdom;
when governing the people and maintaining equity, practice humility;
when receiving guests and delivering edicts, uphold propriety.
*(When receiving guests and delivering edicts, the term is *bīn zòu*;
when assisting and presenting, the term is *zàn jiàn*.)*

*The Records* say:
"Propriety has *bīn zòu* and *zhào*,
music has *xiāng bù*—
this is the pinnacle of warmth."

Using the people to gain the masses requires virtue,
sending envoys to distant lands requires trust,
commanding Heaven and Earth, controlling the feudal lords requires sagacity.

This, then, is the broad outline of the principle of appointment.

Let us test this theory:
The ancient enlightened kings governed without action yet ruled the world—
was it merely to make them benevolent, courageous, eloquent, wise, humble, proper, virtuous, trustworthy, or sagacious?
Even those left over from Heaven’s punishments and human executions
were not abandoned.

Thus, the crippled and lame were employed,
the blind and deaf were given tasks,
dwarfs and the deformed were utilized,
the blind were made fire-keepers,
the one-eyed were set as overseers,
those with severed noses guarded gates,
those with amputated feet tended forests,
and the maimed and infirm filled the frontier lands.

Thus, above there were no neglected duties,
below there were no wasted talents.
This is how the Three Dynasties achieved enduring stability.

Yet still—
to know whom to employ with benevolence but not recognize the scale of their benevolence,
to know whom to employ with wisdom but not grasp the depth of their insight—
this is insufficient.

Thus it is said:
Meng Gong Chuo could be a counselor for Zhao and Wei in their old age,
but he could not serve as a great minister for Teng and She;
Yan Yuan could rule as sovereign;
Chi Lu could converse with guests.

「Qiu Ye could be the steward for a household of a hundred chariots,
and You could govern a thousand-chariot state by managing its taxes.

From this, one may observe that the teachings of this book
are also based on the magnitude of the responsibilities entrusted.

*The Zhuangzi* says:
*"When the assignment of duties is clear, then the examination of their origins and principles follows.
Only when duties are properly assigned can one examine their origins."*

Thus, it is said:
The **virtue/power** of the benevolent,
is that they do good without striving for gain,
and those below do not resent those above.

The **virtue/power** of the eloquent,
is that they resolve grievances and untangle disputes.

The **virtue/power** of the wise,
is that they address matters as they arise,
and respond to difficulties with appropriate measures.

The **virtue/power** of the loyal subject,
is that they speak truthfully and act uprightly,
correcting the ruler’s errors with firmness.

The **virtue/power** of the righteous subject,
is that they preserve the living and continue the extinct,
and rescue the weak while punishing the violent.

The **virtue/power** of the trustworthy subject,
is that they affirm what is right without wavering in speech.

The **virtue/power** of the upright and modest,
is that they discard personal interests and uphold the public good.

*The Han Feizi* says:
*"Self-promotion is the way of the petty,
while abandoning private interests for the public is the way of the noble."*

The **virtue/power** of the ritualist,
is that they honor the ruler’s carriage and attendants.

The **virtue/power** of the worthy,
is that enemy states fear them,
and the four borders remain unbreached.

The **virtue/power** of the sage,
is that they establish laws in the unseen,
achieve what they seek and obtain what they desire,
are obeyed without question,
draw near and distant alike,
and their wisdom shines in all four directions.
From this up to the unseen,
the responsibility of the sage is clear.

Within, they hold fast to their principles,
using them as a measure for verification—
this is what is meant by **"Dao/Way" as a guiding standard**.

Then comes the ability to judge by a single root or principle,
and to assess people with two words.

Without inner restraint,
one cannot discern the things they observe.
A wealthy man’s generosity reveals his **virtue/power of benevolence**.
A noble man’s promotions reveal his loyalty.

Observe their **great conduct**—
whether they defer to the young or the old,
whether the noble defer to the lowly—
this reveals their sense of **ritual/propriety**.

Observe what they refuse to do,
and this reveals their **righteousness/principle**.

Observe their acceptance of office and governance,
and their decisions to leave or stay—
this reveals their **insight/wisdom**.

Observe whether they are unyielding when pressed,
and this reveals their **courage**.

Observe whether their speech is sharp and their words skillful,
and this reveals their **eloquence**.

Observe whether they do not conceal when entrusted,
and this reveals their **trustworthiness**.

Observe what a poor man refuses to take,
and this reveals their **cleanliness/integrity**.
Observe what a lowly man refuses to do,
and this reveals their **worthiness**.

Measure their depth and observe their Heavenly alignment,
and this reveals their **sageliness**.

The essentials of assigning duties and examining origins
lie in knowing people,
and knowing people lies in having a way to observe them.

Confucius said:
*"Observe the way they act,
consider the circumstances that lead them there,
and examine where they find rest—
how could one fail to know them?"*

Thus, this is further elaborated upon:
The ranks are never misaligned,
and the principles do not contradict each other.

Near and distant are harmonized,
and the prepared are vigilant against change—
*"Prepared"* is how they avoid being constrained,
*"Vigilant"* is how they do not grow weary from adapting.

They understand their duties and act accordingly,
measuring affairs with their own principles.

A ruler without the **Dao/Way** employs the **petty and unworthy**—
the petty and unworthy are those of little virtue,
whose opposite is **noble and strong**—
and their actions bring only confusion and disorder.

A ruler with the **Dao/Way** employs the **noble and strong**,
and their actions are clear and harmonious.

These two principles, once established,
are like the **Mingqi**—
the **Mingtai** below, the **Mingqi** above.

*"Mingqi"* refers to the **sacred vessel**,
and *"Mingtai"* refers to the **spiritual platform**.
*"Sympathy"* and *"verification"* are complementary.

The ruler aligns with their **virtue/power** above,
and the subjects confirm its truth below.

The **ruler’s timing**—
some texts say *"ruler’s intentions"*—
awaits the moment to act.

When the **ruler’s timing** is clear,
they respond to the **Dao/Way** and issue commands.

The worthy in their domains,
though different in nature,
share a common understanding of **timing and circumstances**.

The **ruler’s timing**—
originally *"timing and circumstances"*—
when encountering a person of **virtue/power**,
they do not need to speak to be trusted,
and all the people naturally turn to them in kinship.

When encountering a violent and arrogant person,
the people scatter and flee.
Above and below grow suspicious of each other,
and their conflicts spiral like an unbroken ring,
day and night without end.

Those who offer counsel are not heeded,
those who speak are placed in danger,
and there is no way to hear of mistakes—
thus, great ministers feign loyalty but are not truly so.

Therefore, a ruler who loves their people like a father
does not need to summon them;
this is the effect of the **sacred platform**.

Thus, they shine with **light/clarity**,
and their reputation ends in splendor.

If they punish without first instructing,
or love while demanding closeness—
some texts say *"love while seeking intimacy"*—
then they invite **calamity**,
and their end is in misfortune.

When the worthy serve their ruler,
they adjust and harmonize—
some texts say *"know and unite"*—
their **Dao/Way** is pure and steadfast,
like the **unyielding**—
some texts say *"fortified"*—
**worthy subjects** who act with restraint.

They lead and transform them,
and the world follows in approval.
Their **Dao/Way** grows ever more aligned,
and thus their end is certain to flourish.

When the petty serve their ruler,
they strive to obscure their ruler’s clarity,
block their hearing,
exploit their authority,
and make people cold or hot with their schemes—
some texts say *"create discord"*—
relying on the ruler’s power,
they manipulate others’ comfort.

The world despises them,
and their rise is marked by ruin—
some texts say *"their height is ominous"*—
thus their end is certain to fail,
and their misfortune extends to their kin.

This is the transformation between ruler and subject,
the distinction between order and chaos,
the key to the rise and fall of states,
and the critical juncture for a nation’s fate.

*"Critical juncture"* can also mean *"warning"* or *"checkpoint"*.
The path of **reversal and compliance**, **benefit and harm**, arises from here.

In general, what can be done without study or learning,
is only **breathing and eating**.

Thus, the ancient kings passed down the **Dao/Way**—
some texts say *"broadened the Dao/Way"*—
the ancient kings, or alternatively *"the first teachers"*,

to emulate and inherit.

Worthy rulers follow established laws,
and their legacy endures for generations.
Unworthy rulers do not comply,
and their dynasty perishes in their own time.

The laws of **Yu** still exist,
yet the **Xia** never became a perpetual dynasty—
this is why.

Nearly the same as *"repeatedly"*—
some texts say *"seventh"*—

Pang Zi asked the **Lu Guan Zi**:
*"What does the sage’s **Dao/Way** prioritize?"*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Prioritizing people."*

Pang Zi asked:
*"What does the **Dao/Way of people** prioritize?"*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Prioritizing arms."*

Pang Zi asked:
*"Why abandon Heaven and prioritize people?"*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Heaven is vast and difficult to know,
its blessings cannot be requested,
and its calamities cannot be avoided.
To model oneself after Heaven is to oppose the **Dao/Way**."*

The Earth is vast and profound,
its benefits are many—*or, its use is broad*—yet its punishments are few,
Heaven is exalted yet distant,
Earth is near yet not unexalted.
To model oneself after Earth is to bring shame;

**Time** arises, shifts, and changes without pause—
to model oneself after **Time** is to falter.
These three cannot be relied upon to establish **Dao/Way** or shape customs,
thus the sage does not follow them.

Pang Zi asked:
*"What of **Yin** and **Yang**?"*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Their **spiritual vitality** and luminous clarity align with Heaven,
their **spiritual essence** is truly responsive.
**Yin**’s latent stirrings act in concert with Earth,
**Yang**’s daily arc **Yin** follows.
**Yin** and **Yang**’s cold and heat, along with **Time**’s shifts,
these three: when the sage preserves them, order ensues;
when they perish, chaos reigns—
thus, he prioritizes people.

Wealth brings arrogance,
honor brings decay.
War is a tool not employed every hundred years,
yet one cannot forget it for a single day—
this is why the **Dao/Way of people** prioritizes arms.

Pang Zi asked:
*"How does one prioritize arms?"*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Arms are the embodiment of **ritual propriety (礼)**, **rightness (义)**, **loyalty (忠)**, and **trustworthiness (信)**."*

Pang Zi asked:
*"I wish to hear the **Dao/Way of arms**."*

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"Without **Dao/Way**, one dares to defy the noble with the base;
without **rightness (义)**, one dares to encroach upon the great with the small.
When one acts unjustly, **shame and restraint (枉耻禁)** are enforced;
when one returns to correctness, the punishment is abandoned—
thus, one does not slay those who surrender.
A hawk does not strike a fallen bird—how much more so with people?
The highest **Dao/Way** esteems **ritual propriety (礼)**,
nothing is more noble than **restraint (约束)**.
To gain land yet lose **trustworthiness (信)**, even a **sage-king (圣王)** would not rely upon it;
to double one’s words and break one’s **pledges (约)**, each will have their own reasons."*

Pang Zi said:
*"My disciples have heard that: ‘The larger the land, the stronger the state; the more numerous the people, the mightier the army; the mightier the army, the sooner one attains one’s ambitions in the world.’
But now, the armies of great states retreat in disgrace and their words are exhausted—**shame and restraint (枉耻禁)** fail to control them, and orders cannot be enforced. Why is this so?
Orders command what should be done; prohibitions forbid what should not be done.

The **Lu Guan Zi** replied:
*"To know what will come, examine what has passed;
to know the ancient, observe the present.
The ruler who **selects (择) people** and then **employs (用) them** will thrive; the ruler who **employs people** without first **selecting (择) them** will perish.
When **rebellious conduct (逆节)** arises, the unworthy encroach upon the virtuous—**daily (日) oppressing (凌)** them;
when **the low oppress (凌) the high**, it is called **victory (胜)**.
**The high overpower (胜) the low**—this is the way of things.
Now, the question you ask, my friend, **be cautious not to speak of it (子慎勿言)**.

When a state’s land is vast and its people numerous, its army is strong—this is called **sufficiency (足)**.
But if its scholars have **excessive strength (余力)** yet cannot **attain their ambitions in the world (先得志於天下)**, then its ruler is **not virtuous (不贤)** and **acts with arrogance and constraint (骄缢)**.
To **be self-exalted (己亢)** is arrogance; to **be self-satisfied (己满)** is excess.
If a ruler is **not virtuous (不贤)**, he cannot **avoid action (无为)**, nor can he **be trusted to act together (与致为)** with others.
Mencius said: ‘There are things a man **will not do (不为)**, and only then can he **do what is proper (有为)**.’
When one is arrogant, he **despises his enemy (轻敌)**;
when he despises his enemy, he **plots with those he favors (所私谋)**, acting against what he does not know.
He **assigns tasks beyond their strength (非其任力)**, seeking **victory over those not his true enemy (非其敌)**,
without considering the **long-term calamities (终身之患)** of his state,
but instead delighting in **temporary success (须臾之说)**.
Thus, the ruler **suffers slander from his subjects (被过听之谤)** and is **held in contempt by the world (丑於天下)**,
while his ministers **bear false accusations (负滥监)**.
The **blame is directed at enemy states (首之责于敌国)**;
when enemy states **lay the blame upon him (乃责则却)**, they **retreat or are plundered (却或作劫)**,
using **words to evade (以辞那之)**.
If they **retreat (却)**, the speaker is **shamed by his weakness (说者羞其弱)**;
if they **evade with words (以辞却之)**, then the speaker **is shamed by his weakness (则说)**,
while those who **lay the blame (责之者)** are **shamed by his weakness (羞其弱)**—
this **leads to the exhaustion of their strength (其势铃)** until they **must resort to arms (至於用兵)**.
A thousand **base (万贱)** may not **straighten (挠)** one **noble (贵)** who **bows (曲)**;
and those **below (在下者)** have **no means to counter (回)** them."

The state **suffers from grievances (被伸)**, or **is struck by divine punishment (作神创)**,
as **wrongs grow ever larger (浸大日伸)**.
When they **burst forth (其发)**, there is **war (则战)**.
When **grievances erupt into war (其创之发则战)**,
war **brings the common people to their deaths (则是使元元之民往死)**.

The **mistakes of evil ministers (邪臣之失)**—
**blame arises from above (蓟音策也，过生於上)**,
**punishment descends from below (罪死於下)**—
**once they are exposed (俨既外结)**,
the **feudal lords accumulate their crimes (诸侯畜其罪)**,
then **they may be accused of endangering the state (或作责危覆社稷)**,
causing the **rulers of the age to tremble in fear (世主慑惧)**,
**isolating them in cold dread (寒心孤立)**.

If they **are not punished (不伐)**,
though **they may be replaced (伐或作代)**,
**there is still the threat below (下有威字)**.
Such a man **becomes a source of perpetual conflict between two states (二国之难不解)**,
and the **sovereign’s authority is lost (君立不复)**.

**Regret comes too late (悔曩或作晨邮过)**,
**plans shift and change (谋徙计易)**.
Even **a single error (滥一作监首)** is **not enough to bear (不足)**—
**yet it is piled upon him (盖以累重)**;
**if he is the mastermind (滥为谋首)**, his **faults are grave indeed (其过重矣)**.
**How can one man’s hands block the world’s eyes (而一人之手岂足以障天下之目哉)**?

**Extinction of his clan and ruin of his kin (灭门残族#33)**—
**this is the house punishment (灭门，周官所谓屋诛)**.
**The sovereign apologizes to all (公谢天下)**,
**to atone to enemy states (以让敌国)**.
If not,
then **the Dao of war (战道)** will **never cease (不绝)**,
and **the state’s wounds will never heal (国创不息)**.
**This is called “exhausting grievances” (谓之伸创)**—
**for such is their fate (以此故也)**.

**Ah, the great harm of ignorance (大或作天乎哉，夫弗知之害)**!
**For the harm of not knowing is vast indeed (以言弗知之害大矣)**.
**Alas, the extremity of their calamity (悲乎哉，其祸之所极)**!
**For their misfortune is truly sorrowful (以言其祸可悲也已)**.
**This is leaning on nobility while abandoning the Dao (此倚贵离道)**,
**a fate of few men and many faults (少人自有之咎也)**—
**excessive self-reliance, neglect of others (多己少人)**.
**Thus, before the army even advances (师未发轫)**, its **defeat is already foreseen (而兵可迭也)**.
**“The Near Defeat” (《近迭》)** is a **famous chapter (名篇)**,
**taken from this very principle (盖取诸此)**.

Now, **the sovereigns of great states (今大国之君)**,
**do not heed the teachings of the ancient sages (不闻一作问先圣之道)** but **pursue their own desires (而易事)**,
**while their ministers lack wisdom (旱臣无明)** to **assist in great matters (佐之大数)**,
yet **possess cunning (滑正之碎或无碎字智)**—
**they act contrary to principle (反义而行之)**,
**govern against virtue (逆德以将之)**,
**their armies are disgraced (兵讪)**,
**their words exhausted (而辞穷)**,
**their commands ignored (令不行)**,
**their prohibitions defied (禁不止)**—
**what is there left to wonder at (又奚足怪或作恃哉)**?

**Pangzi said: What of this cunning (庞子曰：何若滑正之智)**?**
**Zhuanguanzi replied: The laws cannot be bent (鹖冠子曰：法度无以噫一本作遂意为摸)**—
**to grasp (噫，读为噫彼小星之噫)**.
**Even sages, following patterns and laws (圣人按数循法)**, still **fall short (尚有不全)**.
**Thus, he who does not master his own laws (是故人不百其法者)**,
**cannot rule the world (不能为天下主)**.

Now, **without principle (无数)** yet **self-reliant (而自因)**,
**without law (无法)** yet **self-sufficient (而自备)**,
**following no higher sage’s guidance (循无上圣之或作圣人检)**,
**but judging by his own limited understanding (而断於己明)**—
**though his affairs may seem complete (人事虽备)**,
**how can such a ruler ever perfect himself (将尚何以复百己之身乎)**?**

**For perfection is not his alone (夫百己者，岂独彼有之)**.
**Man is born between heaven and earth (盖人受天地之中以生)**,
**to nurture his form (形体)**,
**to preserve his spirit (保神)**,
**and all marvels are complete within him (而众妙悉备)**.
**Yet in truth (据今言之)**,
**his body contains myriad times more than he knows (其身盖有千百於己者)**,
**and he ends in oblivion (然而所知才止一二)**,
**for he cannot even perfect himself (而卒於泯没无问者)**—
**he cannot master it (不能复之而已)**.

**If the sovereign’s knowledge is unclear (主知不明)**,
**he takes nobility for the Dao (以贵或作责为道)**,
**and personal whim for law (以意为法)**,
**tying or restraining (牵或作牢，或作罕)**.
**The times are deceived (时诳一作诅)**—
**or perhaps rejected (或作拒)**.
**The world is misled (世)**,
**as the low obscures the high (迢下蔽上)**,
**and affairs become disjointed (使事两乖)**—
**both are lost (两失之矣)**.

「Nourishing is not a lasting loss. To take stillness as disturbance, to regard ease as peril—
the common folk suffer hardship, and people grieve.
What calamity could be greater than this?

If one acts thus, on the day he flees north,
his army will be defeated that very day.
When he realizes his fate is lost,
he will have already cast himself into the land of death long ago.

Pangzi said: *"How can one govern with myriad laws?"*
The **Huguanzi** replied: *"Cangjie created the laws.
The original form of the character *fǎ* (法) was written beneath *shū* (书).
Cangjie, the scribe of the Yellow Emperor,
first observed the tracks of birds and beasts receding into the distance,
and thus invented writing and contracts.
Writing begins with *jiǎzǐ* (甲子).
The sun begins at *jiǎ* (甲),
and the earthly branches at *zǐ* (子).
Established scribes, the **Liguan** (李官),
—*chéngshǐ* (成史), meaning those who completed and reported cases to the ruler,
and *Liguan* (李官), meaning the judicial officers—
did not follow the Dao.
Yet without Cangjie, there would be no rise of script and ink.
Though Cangjie invented writing without teaching the scribes and judicial officers,
script and ink began to sprout from this moment.
This is the origin of myriad laws.

Even if the laws are recorded in diagrams,
their purpose—illustrating the heart,
expressing intentions,
and promoting the Dao—
is but a fraction, perhaps one-tenth,
of what they truly contain.
How could one without script and ink
ever fully exhaust their intentions in diagrams?

From the perspective of later ages,
writing is for practical convenience,
seals are inferior to cursive script,
and cursive script is inferior to草书 (*cǎoshū*).
Thus, the bluntness of diagrams in responding to affairs is evident.

Therefore it is said:
*"To weave together the affairs of the world,
to record what endures and lasts far into the future,
to depict what is unseen by the eye,
and to transmit what the heart cannot comprehend—
nothing surpasses writing."*

*"Unseen by the eye"* refers to what is subtle and barely perceptible,
*"uncomprehended by the heart"* refers to what is profound and elusive.
Thus, those who know myriad laws
are the **Jiexiong** (桀雄) [tyrants and heroes].
If one understands them as *"transcending form, the unseen, and the yet-to-be"*—
then he knows the will of ten thousand people.
This is the power of virtue (*dé*), not merely the knowledge of tyrants and heroes.
Thus, his understanding surpasses that of ten thousand people,
for it spans these three realms beyond ordinary perception.

*"The yet-to-be"* is superior to *"the unseen"* (*wúxíng*),
and *"the unseen"* is superior to *"the formless"* (*húnlún*).
In analogy, if one speaks of the **Taiji** (太易),
it is *"the yet-to-be"*;
while *"the Taichu"* (太初),
is the formless;
*"the Húnlún"* (浑沦),
is the yet-to-be in its primal state.

One without the wisdom of ten thousand people
cannot dwell above the teachings of the world.
Pangzi said: *"I have received strict instruction,
and studied my craft with questions and answers."*
Yet when he consulted his teacher,
his disciples grew ever more fearful.

**Lǔ Diàn’s Commentary on *Húguānzǐ* (卷中) – Chapter 8: *Dùwàn* (度万)**
**Pángzǐ asks Húguānzǐ:**
*"The Sage and the Divine deliberate together—
how does one respond?"*

**Húguānzǐ replies:**
*"The Dao differs; they do not deliberate together.
The Dao fulfills itself with humanity."*

**Pángzǐ asks:**
*"If not the proper person, the Dao does not act in vain.
I wish to hear the essentials of measuring the Divine’s deliberation and fulfilling its purpose—how so?"*

**Húguānzǐ says:**
*"Heaven is the Divine; Earth is form.
When Earth is damp, fire arises—
the utmost Yang blazes forth, blazing from the Earth.
When Heaven is dry, water arises—
the utmost Yin solemnizes, solemnizing from Heaven.

When laws are fierce and punishments excessive, the Divine grows damp—
laws and punishments are Yin.
If the Divine grows damp, Heaven does not generate water.

When sounds and tones are inverted, form grows dry—
sounds and tones are Yang.
If form grows dry, Earth does not generate fire.

If water and fire do not arise,
Yin and Yang lack the means to form *qi*,
measurements lack the means to establish order,
the Five Phases lack the means to wield their dominion.
All things lack the means to manifest their kind,
a hundred undertakings perish, ten thousand beings suffer.

Teeming and chaotic—who comprehends their cause?
Heaven and humanity share the same principles;
Earth and humanity share the same order.
Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s arrangements align with humanity.

The worthy and unworthy differ in ability—
thus, the Sage cannot be disordered,
as when Yáo and Shùn slew those who sought evil—
like Gōnggōng and Huàndōu—
nor can the foolish be discerned,
as when Jié and Zhòu slew those who sought good—
like Lóngróng and Bǐgān.

Yin and Yang are the rectitude of *qi*.
Heaven and Earth are the rectitude of form and spirit.
The Sage is the rectitude of *virtue*.
Laws are the rectitude of the four seasons.
If late spring enforces winter’s decrees, cold prevails;
if late autumn enforces summer’s decrees, warmth prevails.

Thus, one principle lost here disrupts ten thousand there—
the loss is slight, yet the ruin is vast.

What is called Heaven is not the vast *qi* of the sky;
what is called Earth is not the bare soil beneath.
*Bó* (膊) means ‘boundary of form.’

What is called Heaven speaks of that which governs all things without being overcome—
Heaven is the Way of the Sovereign,
over whom nothing under Heaven prevails.
What is called Earth speaks of that which balances all things without disorder—
Earth is the Way of the Minister,
leveling all things under Heaven without chaos.

Sound is its deliberation—
harmonized comparisons form deliberation.
Tone is its action—
dispersed implementation forms action.
Sound is Heaven’s three luminaries—
the three luminaries harmonized above.
Tone is Earth’s five senses—
the five senses dispersed below.

When form and spirit align, life’s principles are refined—
if form does not suffer from excessive dryness,
if spirit does not suffer from excessive dampness,
then life’s principles are refined.

To nurture life excessively beyond its root is to lose *virtue*—
if one over-nourishes its root beyond reason,
without attaining comprehensive harmony,
what is moderate becomes too much,
and its *virtue* fails in response to things—
how could it speak to the *Classics* of nurturing life?

Thus it is said:
*A master of nurturing life, like tending sheep,
goes behind the stragglers and urges them on.*

[Missing character]—
One version omits a character; another reads [missing character], or [missing character] as *rú* (*如*).

*"Knowledge without the Dao*
*disrupts Heaven’s patterns above,*
*erases Earth’s arrangements below.*
*Heaven and humanity share principles,*
*Earth and humanity share order—*
*this is now evident.*

*Severing harmony within humanity,*
*governance falters from beginning to end.*
*It speaks of governance that progresses from first to last*
*yet loses the central path.*

Thus, hearing without perception,
seeing without vision—
*all things under Heaven sink into obscurity.*
*Bright daylight grows dark,*
*as when the Dipper appears at noon.*

*There is principle yet no clarity—*
*what humanity possesses,*
*it cannot eulogize.*
*Losing the eulogy, it is confused.*
*Blaming what others lack,*
*it must exceed what others cannot reach—*
*driving progress far away and punishing what is unreachable.*

*Examining officials after their deeds yet failing to exhaust their love—*
*‘Shǐ’ (史) means ‘envoy.’*
*From ‘shěng’ (省).*
*It speaks of not exhausting one’s own love yet demanding others’ exhaustion.*

*Driving the people to completion yet not seeking their substance—*
*‘Qū’ (区) means ‘to drive.’*
*From ‘shěng’ (省).*
*It speaks of not exhausting one’s own loyalty yet expecting others’ achievement.*

*Empty reputations vie in height,*
*pure clarity turns to darkness.*
*Seeking hollow fame while distorting reality.*
*‘Black’ may also be ‘mò’ (墨).*
*Mò is also black.*
*The *Shījīng* says:*
*‘The fox’s pelt is gray,*
*yet black is made bright.’*

*Motion and stillness pivot like a knot—*
*adapting to things as a knot is turned.*
*The spirit severed, defiance arises—*
*defiance reports upward,*
*insubordination speaks upward,*
*speaking of the spirit’s countenance repelling others a thousand *lǐ* away.*

*The *jing* of *qi* is unnatural,*
*form departs from proper naming.*
*The *Shūjīng* says:*
*‘There is form and there is name.’*
*Form is what designates this thing.*
*Name is what commands this thing.*
*If the *jing* of *qi* strays,*
*then form does not adorn name.*

*The Five *qi* lose their proper order,*
*the four seasons fail to manifest.*
*Yin and Yang clash,*
*the four seasons do not arrive,*
*the harmony of cold and heat fails to form.*
*Excess arises above,*
*guilt brings death below—*
*the age is nearing its end.*

*They drive toward calamity,*
*as if urging a chariot toward it.*
*They open gates to flee fortune,*
*as if fleeing fortune like one fleeing through an open door.*
*The worthy are mocked.*
*The foolish govern the state,*
*Heaven’s retribution is foreseen,*
*disaster—*
*or ‘qǐ’ (蔷), also ‘qiáng’ (蔷).*

「Harm and disorder intermingle,
Humans grasp at omens as calamities arise—
Who can truly know their limits?

They see only form,
Yet remain blind to its underlying *Dao/Way*.
They behold the sun and moon yet do not gain true clarity,
They hear thunder yet do not become truly wise.
When matters arise, those who debate *dharma/virtue* (or *yì* 義) cannot alter fate’s inevitability.
They cannot extinguish it before its sprouting.

Thus, those who skillfully navigate change observe its roots:
If the roots are strong, all will be fulfilled;
If weak, then *virtue/power* (德) must be thin,
And soldiers must grow weary.
How can they wield *biǎn* (褊, narrow-minded) materials
To praise *shāng yǐn* (襄隐, concealing virtues) or broaden *dharma/virtue* (博义)?

Those whose words are smooth yet their actions yield no fruit,
Whose deceit does not cease—
They arise from roots that are insufficient.
It is not a fault of few words or lack of martial prowess.
Hence, rulers have two *zhèng* (政, governance),
And ministers have two *zhì* (制, measures).
If ministers do not apply them,
The ruler cannot enforce them,
Ministers must perish,
And the ruler cannot halt it.
Therefore, the sage-king perceives alone,
And establishes officials to entrust *cháng* (长, longevity/authority) to those within,
And *hé* (和, harmony) to those without.
When officials wield *cháng* (长, longevity/authority),
Within, they uphold justice;
Without, they defend the borders,
And enforce laws to maintain order.

Humans are inherently without harm,
By aligning with the proper order of Heaven and Earth,
Commands flow from singularity—
Many gates are sealed.
Dispersed without direction,
Transforming all things—
All things (or *wúwù* 无物, nothingness) arise from *order* (令).
Guarding the singular *Dao/Way*,
Regulating all things—
This is *law* (法).
*Law* (法) is the guardian within boundaries.
*Order* (令) is the one who issues regulations.
*Order* (令) is what implements *law* (法).

If *law* (法) does not fail in its principles,
These principles arise from *dharma/virtue* (義) that cannot be fixed,
And thus they pursue change.
If *order* (令) does not harm *principle/rightness* (理),
The king issues it from singular *principle* (理一),
And it cannot be altered—
This is what upholds *law* (法).
Hence, the virtuous obtain *respect* (尊),
The petty obtain *caution* (谨),
And all are preserved—
*Cháng* (昌, flourishing) or *mǐ* (靡, decline).

The mind is complete in its *divine* (神) essence,
The form is complete in its *Dao/Way* (道).
It fulfills the virtues of Heaven and Earth,
And embodies the *divine* (神明) countenance.

Humans rely on established *principles* (则),
And on established *law* (法).
The scholar uses them as his measure.
*Law* (法) is adjusted while *Yin* and *Yang* are harmonized.

The *fènghuáng* (凤凰, phoenix) is the bird of *zhēnhuǒ* (鹑火, or *wúzhēnhuǒ* 无鹑火, perhaps no bird),
The *xiāngxiū* (玄枵, dark void) beast—
The essence of *Yang*.
The male is called *fèng* (凤),
And *huáng* (凰) is its female counterpart.
*Zhēnhuǒ* (鹑火) is the second star of *Nánxīng* (南星, Southern Dipper).
The *qílín* (麒麟, kirin) is the *xiāngxiū* (玄枵) beast,
The essence of *Yin*.
The female is called *lín* (麟),
And *qí* (骐) is its male counterpart.
*Xiāngxiū* (玄枵) is the second star of *Běixīng* (北星, Northern Dipper).
*Qí* (骐) resembles *lín* (麟) yet lacks horns.

The *wànmín* (万民, ten thousand people) are the essence of *virtue/power* (德),
For *virtue/power* (德) can gather them—
Or *jùn* (骏, swift/strong).
When their essence fully arrives,
Pangzi asks:
*How does one gather them?*

The **Huluguanzi** says:

The **Heaven and Earth**, *Yin* and *Yang*, take their measure from the body,
Thus the **Five Rectitudes** are arranged to govern the **Five Clarities**#12.
The **Five Rectitudes** are explained below.
The **Five Clarities** should be understood as:
*Clarity of the Vital Essence* (名尸气皇),
*Clarity of the Divine Mind* (名尸神明),
*Clarity of the Virtuous Sage* (名尸贤圣),
*Clarity of the Sovereign Ruler* (名尸后王),
*Clarity of the Noble Minister* (名尸公伯).
The **Ten Transformations** and **Nine Ways**—
Their details I have not yet heard.
The measure begins with the body.
The **Five Tones** and **Six Pitches** take their origin from the body.
Great **Yǔ** established **sound** as the **pitches** and the **body** as the **measure**—
This is what is meant by *"taking measure from the body."*
**Five times five** makes **twenty-five**, by which the world is governed.
**Five** refers to the **Five Tones**.
**Six times six** makes **thirty-six**, by which the **yearly pattern** is established.
**Six** refers to the **Six Pitches**.
The **pattern of a year** corresponds to **thirty-six decads**.
*Qi* is generated by the **Spirit**,
The **Way** is completed by the **Spirit**.
To **shed** *qi* is called **emptiness**,
To **shed** emptiness is called the **Way**.
Yet the **Spirit**—
It exists yet is not *qi*,
It does not exist yet is not the **Way**.
Though not *qi*, it gives rise to *qi*,
Though not the **Way**, it completes the **Way**.
Only the **Sage** can rectify the **tones** and harmonize the **sounds**,
Thus his **virtue/power** ascends to **Tàiqīng**—
**Tàiqīng**, the Heaven—
Descends to **Tàiníng**—
**Tàiníng**, the Earth—
And permeates all **ten thousand beings**.
Glistening dew descends,
White **elixir** emerges,
**Liquor-spring** flows,
**Liquor-spring**, its taste like *lì* (fermented rice wine), can nourish the aged.
**Crimson grass** grows,
**Crimson grass**, which can dye for rank distinction.
All auspicious signs are complete.
The *Transmission* says:
The **Sovereign** unifies *Yin* and *Yang*,
The **auspicious *qi*** fills the world,
The **auspicious signs** all arrive,
Responding to **virtue/power** and appearing.
When **virtue/power** reaches Heaven, the **Polaris** shines bright, the sun and moon radiate light, and sweet dew descends.
When **virtue/power** reaches Earth, fine millet grows, *bìngjiá* (a type of bean) sprouts, and *jùshāng* (a sacred wine) emerges.
When **virtue/power** manifests in culture, the **august star** appears, and the **Five Celestial Stems** move in harmony.
When **virtue/power** reaches plants, **crimson grass** grows, and trees bear connected branches.
When **virtue/power** reaches birds and beasts, the **phoenix** soars, the **luán** (mythical bird) dances, the **qílín** arrives, the **white tiger** appears, the **white pheasant** descends, the **white deer** is seen, and the **white crow** alights.
When **virtue/power** reaches mountains and hills, **august clouds** emerge, **lingzhi** mushrooms flourish, hills yield strange **elixir**, mounds produce *yúfú* (a medicinal herb), mountains bear chariots and vehicles, and marshes yield divine tripods.
When **virtue/power** reaches deep waters and springs, the **yellow dragon** appears, the **liquor-spring** surges, the **Yellow River** reveals dragon scriptures, the **Luo River** presents turtle books, the **Jiang River** yields great shells, and the **sea** produces bright pearls.
When **virtue/power** reaches the **eight directions**, the **auspicious wind** arrives, the **auspicious *qi*** is timely, the **bells and drums** are attuned, the **musical measures** are applied, the **four barbarians** are civilized, and the **Yùzhōu** (southern peoples) offer tribute.
Thus, when all auspicious signs are complete,
The **Way of the Outer Sovereign and Inner Spirit** is fully realized.
The **august star** shines luminous.
The **august star** is the **star of virtue/power**.
Its form is not constant,
Yet it always appears in lands of the **Dao**,
And when the month dies, it appears to assist the moon in illuminating the people’s nightly labors.
In times of **culture**, it causes the world’s armies to rest;
In times of **martial might**, no army in the world can resist it.
One version reads: *"In times of martial might, none in the world can resist."*
Without the word *"armies"*.
Far becomes near,
Hidden becomes manifest,
Great becomes small,
Many become few—
None do not begin from the subtle.
Thus what is **obtained** in its completion cannot be fully described;
What is **lost** in its defeat cannot be fully named.
One version reads: *"cannot be fully named"* instead of *"described."*
From this onward—or one version reads *"From life onward"*—
Your son cannot answer,
Nor can I speak of it.
The essentials of inquiry:
To know the near and foresee the far,
To govern the **One** and transform the **Ten Thousand**.
A ruler without desire cannot be spoken to of governance.
What does this mean?
According to my learning,
The ruler’s affliction lies in excessive desire.
This is why **Mencius**, though he saw the **King of Qi** three times, spoke not,
Saying: *"I first attack his perverse heart."*
Thus it is said:
*"Within, he is filled with excessive desire,
Yet outwardly, he practices benevolence and righteousness—
How can he hope to emulate the governance of **Tang** and **Yú**?"*
The *Nánhuá* (Southern Flower) says:
*"If desire follows harmony, the *qi* becomes even,
If desire seeks the Spirit, the mind becomes still,
If desire strives for correctness, it follows necessity."*
This differs from the *Huluguanzi*.
In ancient times, **Guǐgǔ** wrote a book
To persuade the **Marquis** through eloquence,
Using **open** and **closed** tactics,
Necessarily aligning with their likes and dislikes, joys and sorrows, to **open or close** accordingly.
Yet when one reaches the **desireless**,
One cannot persuade them.
If so, a ruler with excessive desire becomes the **Horizontalist’s** target,
Seeking to sell their schemes.
But the *Huluguanzi* speaks of the **Way**,
Yet its later currents descend to this—
Is it not too base?
If the **virtuous** are not employed,
The state cannot be made prosperous—
This is its essential point.

**Pángzǐ** asked: *"May I ask about the **Five Rectitudes**?"*
The **Huluguanzi** replied: *"There is **Spirit-transformation**, **Official governance**, **Teaching governance**, **Adaptive governance**, and **Action-governance**—or one version reads **‘Contention-governance’**."*

**Pángzǐ** asked: *"I wish to hear their forms."*
The **Huluguanzi** replied: *"**Spirit-transformation** acts before creation,
**Official governance** follows the **root**,
**Teaching governance** cultivates within oneself,
**Adaptive governance** does not alter customs,
**Action-governance** corrects—or one version reads **‘rectifies’**—at the end."*

**Pángzǐ** asked: *"I wish to hear their practices."*
The **Huluguanzi** replied: *"**Spirit-transformation**—
It stabilizes Heaven and Earth,
**Prefigures** the **Four Seasons**,
Its **essence** is always thus.
It **extracts**—or one version reads **‘teaches’**—*Yin* and *Yang*,
It **transfers** cold and heat.
Its **essence** changes thus.
The *Transmission* says:
The **True Person** of antiquity
**Lifted** Heaven and Earth,
**Grasped** *Yin* and *Yang*.
The **flow** was rectified, and all things were born without harm,
All classes were fully realized—
This is called **Clarity of the Vital Essence**.
**Fúyì** obtained it,
To inherit the **Essence-Mother**.
Is this not close?
**Official governance**—
It **models** *Yin* and *Yang*,
*Yin* and *Yang*, the **root of royal affairs**,
Responding to what should be.
**Spirit-transformation** acts before creation,
Thus it ascends to a higher rank.
Earth is tranquil, Heaven is clear,
All beauties gather—
This is called **Clarity of the Divine Mind**.
**Teaching governance**—
It **establishes** the **Four Seasons**,
Such as reciting in spring, playing strings in summer, studying rites in autumn, and reading books in winter,
Following the seasons and aligning with *qi*—
Thus its **achievements** are easy."

**Translation:**

*"To govern by aligning with the Dao—
Bow low to govern, rise high to align with the Dao.
This is called **Exalted Sagehood**.

For those who rule,
They summon **Exalted Sagehood** and cultivate the **Art of the Dao-heart**,
With reverence in service, harmony in life—
This is called **Later Sovereignty**.

For those who govern,
They summon **Ren-Sainthood** and seek wisdom within,
Yet cannot summon **Exalted Sagehood** nor attain the **Art of the Dao-heart**—
Only **Ren-Sainthood** and wisdom.

**Sainthood** is the **Dao of Heaven**.
**Exalted Sagehood** is the **Dao of Earth**.
**Ren-Sainthood** is the **Dao of Man**.

If one **refines the herding of the Spirit**—
*Refinement* is urgent command,
*Herding* is driving and restraining.
Officials are appointed, their roles defined,
Yet the **Spirit-essence** grows weary,
Unable to **pervade universally**,
Thus additional officials are established.

**Teaching** is bitter yet its benefits are distant—
Though teaching is bitter, its benefits are distant.
From this arise **laws and institutions**.
The myriad laws are in tumult—
From here they arise.

**Law** is to make one abandon private gain for the public good—
**Law** is to remove, not to bestow.
**Uniform knowledge and unified warning**—
It is to have those of shared principle,
Not to force private conformity.

Thus, in the **most refined governance**, it is not so—
Yet it is called **Public Lordship**.
*Public* as in the **Public Lord**,
*Lord* as in the **Dominant Sovereign**.

**Chapter Nine: The Hammer of Kings**
Pangzi asked the **Crowned Crane Master**:
‘The **Dao of the Supreme Sage**—
When one clan upholds it, it lasts ten thousand years.
The *Transmission* says:
*"When Heaven and Earth were first established,
The **Celestial Sovereign**—also called **Heavenly Spirit**—
Ruled for ten thousand years.
Thus, the **Supreme Sage** was likely another name for the **Celestial Sovereign**.

Yet in the world, armies grew strong,
And the age could not be seized.
When Heaven and Earth were first established,
How could there already have been armies?
This is but a **fishing net and trap**—
A metaphor, not fact.’

The *Southern Bloom* says:
‘Allegory is nineteen parts,
Repeated speech is seventeen parts.
To endure with Heaven and Earth,
Long since severed from all resemblance.
*Severed*—the most refined distinction.’

The *Central Harmony* says:
‘Even hair retains its order.
To equal the disparate—
The vast difference between **Peng and Wild Goose** in size,
The varying lengths of **Teal and Crane**—
This is insufficient to describe their divergence.
Such is their utter separation.’"*

The world has none who do not speak of **cultivating customs and establishing transformations**—
yet how could he alone **practice the Dao** to reach such an extreme?

The *Lüguanzi* says:
*"He achieved the Dao of the Peng Sovereign of Heaven."* (A pause.)

Thus, none could **augment his virtue/power** or **exalt his spiritual essence**.

Pangzi said:
*"What is this Dao of Heaven?*
*How does it manifest so that none can augment his virtue/power or exalt his spiritual essence?"*
This is to **inquire into its origin**.

The *Lüguanzi* replied:
*"The Dao of Heaven is the **authenticity of the Sun’s virtue/power**.*
*The Sun either has its name or does not—*
*when the solstices come,*
*winter brings the Sun’s retreat to the north,*
*summer brings its return to the south.*
*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as a principle.*
*He takes the **centrality of the Sun’s virtue/power**.*

*The Dao of Heaven is the **trustworthiness of the Moon’s phases**.*
*The Moon trusts in death and trusts in birth,*
*ending to begin anew—*
*when the new moon arrives, the light is born,*
*when the full moon arrives, the light dies.*
*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as governance.*
*He takes **rectitude from the Moon’s phases**.*

*The Dao of Heaven is the **illumination of the stars’ alignment**.*
*The stars are the great stars—*
*those of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.*
*Though their ranks may be **eroded or arranged**,*
*they proceed in their proper order,*
*so that none can disrupt their **chaptered harmony**.*
*Small stars do not vanish when obscured.* (Missing character: *#18*)

*The Dao of Heaven is the **adherence to seasonal order**.*
*The four seasons follow their names,*
*replacing or **transforming** each other without **encroaching or clashing**.*
*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as an inevitable law.*
*He takes **timely regulation** from the seasons.*

*The Dao of Heaven is the **unity of its singular method**—*
*whether it be **manifest or latent**,*
*its **identity remains unchanged**.*
*Before and after, left and right,*
*past and present—all align naturally.*
*Yet why should people **worry over their own decline and fall**?*
*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as a constant.*
*The Dao of Heaven is **authenticity, trustworthiness, illumination, adherence, and unity**—*
*authenticity in the Sun’s virtue/power,*
*trustworthiness in the Moon’s phases,*
*illumination in the stars’ alignment,*
*adherence in seasonal order,*
*unity in its singular method.*
*It does not act as a **universal progenitor**.*
*Or it **transforms** into a universal progenitor.*
*It **transforms** into a universal progenitor.*
*Changing its unity, yet not abandoning it,*
*unity alone is insufficient to **contain** it.*
*Thus, none can exalt or augment it.*
*Peng achieved this unity,*
*so none dare fail to **submit to his governance**.*
*This is what is meant by a **sage-king who upholds the Dao** for the world.*

Pangzi said:
*"I wish to hear of his governance."*

The *Lüguanzi* replied:
*"The governance of Peng is to **harmonize with the divine and the luminous**,
**upright in body and principle**.* (Missing character: *□*)
*To **fathom the depths below and measure the heights above**—*
*to **restrain and gather all things** yet never grow weary,*
*to **flow and illuminate everywhere** without obstruction.*
*Returning to the **totality of Heaven and Earth**,*
*thus he could **plan for the world**.*
*To **go forth without returning**,*
*how could he **share in the people’s joys and sorrows**?*
*He was **clear in foresight**,*
*never confused, **far-reaching in discernment**—*
*preserving the **auspices of life and death**,*
*observing the **patterns of safety and peril**.*

Pangzi said:
*"I wish to hear of these patterns."* (Missing character: *#20*)

The *Lüguanzi* replied:
*"To **settle the lower realm in tranquility**—"

*"A pile of earth—*
*too low to bear a load,*
*or perhaps it can,*
*but its feet are stacked precariously.*
*Yet even the highest mound cannot stand firm—*
*such is the nature of peril and safety.*
*To heap the low and seek stability above*
*is difficult indeed.*
*What then of those who stand upon it?*
*How could their footing not falter?*
*‘Stacked feet’ means to tread,*
*‘planting’ means to stand,*
*‘curved’ means to bend.*

*Discerning human nature,*
*probing the principles of all things,*
*harmonizing with Heaven and Earth—*
*‘harmonizing’ means to measure,*
*to govern without peril.*
*Surveying mountains and rivers,*
*to move and align all things with order—*
*the slow and the swift,*
*the confined and the free.*
*Nurturing life without harm,*
*parents without blame.*
*Generous in taking and giving,*
*thorough in teaching the Dao—*
*teaching for others,*
*the Dao for oneself.*
*Concise in speech,*
*‘speech’ means direct words,*
*‘language’ means questioning doubts.*
*Faithful in agreements,*
*fulfilling promises without evasion,*
*returning promises as one’s own.*
*The *Rites* say:*
*‘Better to bear resentment*
*than to break a promise.’*
*Neither joy nor anger oversteps—*
*joy does not exceed generosity,*
*anger does not exceed taking away.*
*His armies are not martial,*
*but rooted in custom,*
*and his influence stems from this.*

Pangzi said:
*'I wish to hear of human nature and the principles of things,*
*how to restrain all things,*
*harmonize with Heaven and Earth,*
*and embody the divine and upright.'*

The *Lüguanzi* replied:
*'The Way of Chengjiu*
*has never strayed from Heaven’s curves or the Sun’s methods.*
*Heaven’s curves are clear and easy to follow.*
*The Sun’s methods are essential and easy to practice.*
*Heaven’s curves are like organizing five families into a *wu* and five *wu* into a county.*
*The Sun’s methods are like using household heads for daily oversight and *dian* officials for decadal reviews.*
*This system arose in the late Zhou,*
*yet it is said Chengjiu employed it—*
*as if today’s innovations were yesterday’s truths.*
*Thus, this text contains many allegories.*

Pangzi said:
*'I wish to hear of Heaven’s curves and the Sun’s methods.'*

The *Lüguanzi* replied:
*'In governing the towns,*
*let those skilled in five families form a *wu*,*
*and its leader oversee them.*
*Ten *wu* form a *li*, and the *li* appoints officials.*
*Four *li* form a *bian*—*
*—*though *bian* should be *dian*.*
*—and its leader governs.*
*Ten *bian* form a *xiang*, and the *xiang* appoints a teacher.*
*Five *xiang* form a county, with a *shefu* to administer.*
*Ten counties form a prefecture, governed by a great official.*
*These are called ‘official attendants.’*
*The prefecture’s great official inspects his counties,*
*the *shefu* inspects his *xiang*,*
*the *xiang* teacher inspects his *bian*,*
*the *bian* leader inspects his *li*,*
*the *li* officials inspect their *wu*,*
*and the *wu* leader inspects his households.*
*Matters are mutually verified,*
*residences mutually observed,*
*comings and goings mutually supervised.*
*—*‘Supervised’ means to watch closely.*
*Fathers speak of righteousness to fathers,*
*children speak of filial piety to children.*
*Elders speak of goodness,*
*the young of respect.*
*Morning and evening, they permeate one another,*
*thus cultivating filial devotion.*

*If any move or settle,*
*households receive them,*
*people entrust one another;*
*the missing or stolen have no place to hide.*
*This is the nature of human affairs and things.*

*If a *wu* has surplus or shortage in dwellings,*
*or violates orders without cause,*
*they must report to the *li* officials—*
*yet if they fail to report,*
*it is called ‘disorder in the household,’*
*and the *wu* leader shares the blame.*
*—*‘Shares the blame’ means the *wu* leader is held accountable for the *wu*’s offense.*

*If the *li* has disrespect for elders or neglects the young,*
*or behaves differently from others,*
*and does not fully report to the *bian* leader,*
*it is called ‘disorder in the *li*,’*
*and the *li* officials are punished,*
*while the offending household is made an accessory.*
*—*‘Accessory’ means secondary.*

*If the *bian* fails to timely inspect and teach,*
*and does not fully report to the *xiang* teacher,*
*it is called ‘disorder in the *bian*,’*
*and the *bian* leader is punished,*
*while the offending household is made an accessory.*

*If the *xiang* fails to timely inspect and teach,*
*and does not fully report to the county *shefu*,*
*it is called ‘disorder in the *xiang*,’*

*If the county *shefu* fails to timely inspect and teach,*
*and does not fully report to the prefecture,*
*while good deeds go unrecognized*
*—*called ‘obscuring clarity’—*
*or evils are concealed*
*—*called ‘lowering comparisons’—*
*it is called ‘disorder in the county,’*
*and the *shefu* is executed without pardon.*

*Heaven employs the Four Seasons,*
*Earth employs the Five Elements,*
*The Son of Heaven holds One to govern the center,*
*to oversee the balance between the two realms.*

*He harmonizes with the Five Tones,*
*rectifies with the Six *Lǘ* (Lutes),*
*regulates with measures,*
*and executes with *virtue/power* and punishment,*
*from root to branch,*
*ranking with *jiǎ/yǐ* (first/second).*

*Heaven begins with the *Yuan* (Primordial),*
*Earth begins with the *Shuò* (Beginning).*
*The *Yuan* refers to *qi*,*
*the *Shuò* refers to direction.*

*The movement of Heaven begins with *Xuányuán* (Dark Primordial),*
*the station of Earth begins with *Xuánshuò* (Dark Beginning).*
*The Four Seasons begin with the *Lì* (Calendar).*

*Thus, the Sage-King solemnly entrusts governance to the people,*
*and the true beginning of time lies in the *Lì*.*
*Hence, within the household, one uses *tí* (New Moon),*
*—the *tí* being the zero day of the month._
*The *Gōngyáng Zhuàn* (Public Sprouts Annals) states:*
*‘For *tí* months, only this month is reached,’*
*—the zero day of the month.*

*The *biǎn* (District Officer) employs *xún* (Decades),*
*The *xiāngshī* (Village Teacher) employs *jié* (Nodes),*
*—such as *Jīngzhé* (Awakening of Insects) and *Mángzhǒng* (Grain in Ear).*

*The *xiàn shè fū* (County Treasurer) employs months,*
*The *gōng dàfū* (Prefectural Grandee) employs the arrival of *qì fēn* (Qi divisions),*
*—such as the *èr fēn* (Two Divisions) and *èr zhì* (Two Terminations).*

*The *Zhǔguó* (Chief Minister) employs the Six *Lǘ* (Lutes).*

*The household reports to the *biǎn* (District Officer) every five days,*
*using *tí* (New Moon).*
*The *biǎn* reports to the *xiāng* (Village) every ten days,*
*using *xún* (Decades).*
*The *xiāng* reports to the *xiàn* (County) every fifteen days,*
*using *jié* (Nodes).*
*The *xiàn* reports to the *gōng* (Prefectural) every thirty days,*
*using months.*
*The *gōng* reports to the *Zhǔguó* every forty-five days,*
*using *qì* (Qi).*
*The *Zhǔguó* reports to the Son of Heaven every sixty days,*
*using *lǘ* (Lutes).*

*The Son of Heaven, after seventy-two days,*
*sends an envoy,*
*—alternate reading: sends an envoy to the prefecture.*
*This follows the division of the Five Elements over the year.*

*Indeed, the cycle of a year,*
*each of the Five Elements rules for seventy-two days.*
*Reward the meritorious,*
*punish the unworthy.*
*—Sentence structure unclear; possibly a concluding or explanatory remark.*
*This is how one aligns with the totality of Heaven and Earth.*

The *xiàqíng* (lower officials) report upward every sixty days,
and the *shànghuì* (upper officials) bestow favors every seventy days—
this is the *tiāncù rìshù* (Heaven’s rhythmic art of days).

Thus, the unworthy do not escape their lowliness,
while the virtuous do not lose their brilliance—
*—alternate reading: the Son of Heaven’s favors are bestowed in order,*
*and all affairs proceed smoothly.*

Those who act contrary to the Way are not rewarded!
Under Heaven’s rule, all is serene—
though in darkness there may be those who seek to act contrary,
they find no opportunity to exploit.

Thus none can thwart its strength,
and so it governs the fullness without overflowing,
*—alternate reading: it does not increase what should not be increased,*
*to cause overflowing.*

It sustains the great without diminishing—
*—alternate reading: it does not harm the great,*
*to cause them to wither.*
Withering (*máng*) for speech, means smallness.

The Son of Heaven declares—
*—alternate reading: issues a proclamation on the first day of the month (甲正)—*
that envoys dare not alter their words,
for the ruler’s authority expands—
*—alternate reading: without expansion,*
*they risk obstruction below and concealment above.*
If envoys change their words,
granting pardons or bestowing praise,
the ruler’s authority expands even further,
then their faults lead to obstruction below and concealment above.

Their punishment is execution or flogging without reprieve.
All officials, if they teach harshly and their virtue is thin,
or oppress the people, are immediately dismissed—
*—alternate reading: their mother is dismissed.*
Corrupt officials who disrupt governance,
do not obey commands, or violate the law,
are punished as the people are,
and their evil is spread among the masses.

They profit but do not take advantage of profit,
they govern but do not take advantage of their position—
*—alternate reading: they dare not take advantage of their position.*
Thus, the four quarters follow them,
fearing only that they might come too late.

Hence, they govern Heaven,
*—alternate reading: they govern the great.*
and maintain the four supports.
*The Classic of Guanzi* says:
If the four supports are not maintained,
the state will perish and fall into ruin.

The land is vast and its virtue is manifest,
the world is at peace and joyful,
and the years bring prosperity.
Each official is assigned to oversee a season’s affairs,
and the uppermost virtue is not like that of the *Lìngyīn* (Ordering Minister).
*—alternate reading: the Ordering Minister reports to the ruler,*
*and if he is twice demoted,*
*—alternate reading: if he is then dismissed—*
*his faults are not pardoned.*
*—alternate reading: three times, his faults are not pardoned.*

Governance does not overstep its bounds,
and the *Shǐlǐ* (historians and scribes) do not err.
The public markets are fair,
and the living do not rejoice—
*—alternate reading: not because they are rejoicing.*
The dead do not grieve—

The faults are not pardoned because they are not willfully killed.
The people obtain what they desire, and the state knows no calamity.
Rewards are bestowed upon those with merit, and virtue extends to three generations.
If a father—*alternate reading: each*—has committed a crime, his guilt cannot be erased.
He is named *Yōulì* (Afoul/Illustrious), and even filial sons and kind grandchildren cannot alter this—*alternate reading: establish rites for him*.
Matters are decided by one or two, and thus endure forever without turmoil.

It is better to do good in the neighborhood than in the village.
To do good in the village is better than to do good in the family.
If one is executed—*alternate reading: punished*—
then those who do good may be elevated, and those who do evil may be punished—*alternate reading: admonished*.
No one dares speak of a single day’s goodness, all taking a lifetime as their measure.
Since there are no transgressions in order, transformation is established, and the world has no wickedness.

When transformation is established and customs are formed,
the young align with their peers—*alternate reading: elders*—
the old with their friends,
their leisure and play are of equal rank,
their sacrifices bring shared blessings,
life and death are held in equal love,
calamities and disasters bring shared concern,
residence and dwelling bring shared joy.
Disasters do not disrupt their homes—*alternate reading: daily lives*—
their conduct is harmonious,
their condolences and congratulations are sincere,
their weeping and joy are genuine.
Joy is sufficient to aid one another,
*—missing character*—*alternate reading: conspiracy*—is sufficient to restrain one another.
*—Missing character*—*annotation: "to probe the Way"*,
*—alternate reading: espionage*—*annotation: "secret plotting"*—
they live in mutual peace and docility,
their armies protect one another,
in night battles they trust one another,
in daylight battles they stand firm—*alternate reading: are disciplined*.
Entering to suppress violence,
exiting to rectify wrongdoing,
thus their armies can march and subdue,
and none dare resist them.
Hence, their punishments are set but unused,
they do not contend yet their authority is heavy,
their chariots and armor are not displayed yet the world has no rival—*alternate reading: no way to compare*.
*—alternate reading: the world is without proper conduct*—*alternate reading: is at its end*.

If the Way is lost, the low dare defy the noble,
if righteousness is abandoned, the small dare encroach upon the great.
The *Chéngjiū* (Gathering Birds) having witnessed the succession of ancient ages—
*—alternate reading: the ancient sages*—
losing the Way, their deeds perishing,
*—alternate reading: betraying*—*alternate reading: trusting*—
their original virtue destroyed,
thus they established an enduring—*alternate reading: stunted*—*alternate reading: cultivated*—
nation, with fixed rites and solemn sacrifices—*alternate reading: thus*—
if one cannot preserve their state, their rites are not fixed,
if one cannot preserve their ancestral temple, their sacrifices are not solemn.
Thus the spirits and gods declare:
*—alternate reading: say*—
"Rules cannot be expanded, measures cannot be altered—
this means the law is perfect, lacking nothing and exceeding nothing.
The compass cannot be enlarged, the square cannot be extended.
Not only do people trust it, but even the spirits and gods have no doubt."

The Sage’s laws are like the body:
add to them and they become superfluous,
remove from them and they become deficient.
For the descendants who follow in the end,
only this can be upheld—*alternate reading: there is only this to uphold*—
*—alternate reading: only this can be carried forward*—.
*—Annotation: "effect" as in "demonstrate," as in "effect a dog, effect a sheep"*—
This means to demonstrate to the descendants of later generations:
what is established can be upheld,
what is practiced can be carried forward—
only this is sufficient.

*—Annotation: "carry forward" as in "nurture auspiciousness"*,
*—alternate reading: "bestow blessings"*—those who do not are inauspicious,
*—alternate reading: "release"*—
*—annotation: "full" as in "complete"*—*alternate reading: "entire"*—
*—annotation: "pure" as in "unblemished"*—*alternate reading: "whole"*—
*—annotation: "correct" as in "properly aligned"*—*alternate reading: "heavenly"*—*alternate reading: "cultural"*—
*—annotation: "not grassy" as in "refined"*—*alternate reading: "not dim"*—*alternate reading: "enlightened"*—
The refined and enlightened are the proper order of sacrifice;
the sacrificial animals serve as their assistants.

*The Rites say*: "Away from the temple is the *Táo* (Peach Platform),
away from the *Táo* is the *Tán* (Altar),
away from the *Tán* is the *Zhuàn* (Sacrificial Mound)."
Now, only the *Zhuàn* is mentioned here,
so by the *Zhuàn*, one may infer what follows up to the *Tán*.

The four seasons are honored with sacrifices,
and the ancestral spirits are served as *Jiāráng* (Family Kings)—
*—annotation: "sacrifices continue unbroken, called 'serving as Family Kings'"*—
as divine offerings.
The sacred tokens of ritual efficacy are stored in the ancestral temple
to authenticate—*alternate reading: command*—the lords—*alternate reading: feudal princes*—
*—annotation: "to make them credible symbols, stored in the ancestral temple,
and further authenticated with their seals,
to clarify what later generations must uphold"*—
Thus, their descendants preserve the teaching completely.

The ears and eyes do not weary,
the mind is not distracted—
they do not perceive strange things and stray,
abandoning one’s own desires and removing others’ ills—
*—annotation: "abandoning one’s own desires, removing others’ ills"*—
*—annotation: "This passage has the character 每 above 钩, with one variant reading as 均"*—
*—annotation: "Inwardly profound, or variant reading: wise"*—
intelligence is sufficient to encompass it.
*—annotation: "Firm in what one upholds, virtue is sufficient to safeguard it"*—
*—annotation: "Renewed and yet surpassingly fresh, cycling and yet ever new, the longer the more pristine"*—
the Upper Primordial is the standard—
*—annotation: "All share in receiving its blessings, elevating each other without alteration"*—
*—annotation: "The ancestral order is clear; Tang did not precede Ji, nor did Wu and Wen precede the unenlightened"*—
*—annotation: "Ru elevated Duke Min of Ji, yet lost this principle"*—
*—annotation: "Possibly refers to 'inviting scholars,' though uncertain. This passage first establishes a principle (#26), then applies it without deviation. If one first accepts the principle, it is fixed; thus, what follows cannot alter it. This is the utmost attainment of knowledge"*—
*—annotation: "Extreme, as in 'the utmost of the Upper Primordial'"*—
Pangzi asked: *"May I hear the Dao/Way by which one neither alters nor renews?"*
Huguanzi said: *"Chengzhou—he who received the transmission of the Sovereign’s Dao/Way"*—
*—annotation: "The Sovereign’s Dao/Way is not limited to a single age"*—
Pangzi asked: *"What is the Sovereign’s Dao/Way?"*
Huguanzi said: *"The Sovereign’s Dao/Way is not confined to one era.
It fulfills life through death,
stops killing with killing.
It follows the teaching of balancing inner and outer.
*—annotation: "Teaching may also be read as 'numbers/principles'"*—
*—annotation: "Later variants read '世后成至' instead of '以新续故'"*—
*—annotation: "Sun’s reading omits 灵, with one variant as 虚, another as 羽埋, or 虚村理"*—
*—annotation: "Symbol may also be read as 'modify'"*—
*—annotation: "Though the wise may excel, they dare not falter"*—
*—annotation: "Though the foolish may be clumsy, they dare not abandon"*—
*—annotation: "Luo□ and drought, or variant reading: 'Luo and lowly'"*—
*—annotation: "Possibly 'early' instead of '旱'"*—
It sustains the old with the new."*

The four seasons must be followed with precision,
their effects held firm—*or* [variant: *copper* does not *run wild*].
*—annotation: "Unclear; possible corruption in text"*—

When entering the ancestral temple,
*—annotation: "Confused or altered: *or* [variant: *bright* *or* [variant: *□* does not *succeed*], *or* [variant: *assist*]"—*
*—annotation: "Also read as *greed*"—*
it is called *fán*—*or* [variant: *excessive*].
Fire is generated in great abundance,
yet its harmony is consumed by *fán*.

*The Liezi* says:
*"The skin burns with a scorched hue,
the face darkens with deceitful stains,
the five passions are confused and deluded."*

*—annotation: "Ancestral mandate is blemished in the world.
*—annotation: *Blemished* (忝), as in *unworthy of*.
*—annotation: *World*, as in *generations of virtue*"—*

The heir does not lead the rites in court,
*—annotation: "Does not participate in court ceremonies"*—
the *Delong* does not enter the temple,
*—annotation: "Does not participate in temple rites.
*—annotation: *Delong* (奉常), the ritual officer.
*—annotation: Later Han emperor Jing changed this to *Taichang* (太常), overseeing rites with the ancestral temple"*—

The spirits do not partake in sacrifices,
*—annotation: "Their ghosts do not receive the sacrificial offerings"*—

the clan king does not perform the ancestral rites,
heaven will bring calamity,
the august deities will not be honored.

*—annotation: "If the clan king usurps and performs the rites,
he will incur guilt before heaven,
the august deities—though offered at the *jiao* altar—will not be honored.
*—annotation: *August deities*, the *Wudi Shangdi* (吴天上帝)"—*

This is why the way of not altering, not renewing, not exceeding the new is not changed.
Thus, the sovereign holds no contrary intentions.

The sovereign, once misled and confused, does not succeed—
*—annotation: "If the ruler is misled and confused, his lineage does not endure"*—
his guilt shall be as described above,
then those who follow shall adhere to the old and inspect the new,
*—annotation: "They shall not dare to deviate"*—
for the people’s hearts remain steadfast,
and when aligned with Heaven’s decree, it is so.

**A single standard for ten thousand years,**
*—annotation: "Standard" (范), as in the *Xunzi*’s "standard of form" (范形)*—
nearby shall love his virtue,
distant shall emulate his power without end.
Thus, his teachings are never exhausted,
his governance never impaired,
and he can **unify the Four Seas as one household,**
while the **barbarian and savage tribes** of all nations come at their appointed times
*—annotation: "To pay tribute in their ceremonial attire"*—
to offer their tribute,
*—annotation: "Yet none dare to increase or decrease"*—
**or act presumptuous.**
*—annotation: "This means they submit tribute in proper form, neither adding nor omitting"*—

This is why the **Law-Speech** says:
*"Clad in my pure tribute,
bound with my golden girdle."*
*—annotation: "This is the very meaning"*—

When heard, it is transmitted and translated to return to its original intent.
*—annotation: "Even to the distant"*—
None can alter their customs or shift their teachings,
*—annotation: "As the *Mencius* says: *‘Using the ways of Xia to transform Yi, but never have we heard of transforming into Yi’s ways.’*"—

Thus, his authority stands firm and unassailed,
his influence extends far yet never fades.
This is the **law of the Primordial Sovereign within the Divine,**
*—annotation: "Divine" (帝), Heaven’s title;
"Sovereign" (王), a human designation;
"Primordial" (皇), the comprehensive name of Heaven and humanity, signifying greatness and perfection.
*—annotation: "To call it the law of the Primordial Sovereign within the Divine is to speak of its utmost essence—
truly the convergence of humanity and divinity"*—
and in the lower realm, the **Dao/Way of the Mysterious Sage without the Sovereign,**
*—annotation: "In the lower realm"*—
while in the higher, the **law of the Primordial Sovereign within the Divine.**

**The lineage of Chengjiu** surpasses all others,
*—annotation: "Chengjiu" (成鸠), a legendary sage;
"surpasses" (枋), handle—
meaning its foundation is unshakable"*—
unassailable through generations.
Its merit grows daily and monthly,
thus it can endure alongside Heaven and Earth.

This is why it harmonizes with the **Divine and Bright,**
*—annotation: "To align with the Divine and Bright" (神明) or "proper rituals" (礼正)*—
**without relying on scholars or scribes**
*—annotation: "Scholars" (士), ritual officials;
"Scribes" (史), record-keepers;
"Female Cangjie" (女苍颉), the mythical inventor of Chinese characters"*—
to compose writings,
so later ages cannot fault its governance.

In **Primeval Times, there was governance without laws,**
no appointment of ritual officials,
no creation of written contracts,
yet virtue and the Dao were profoundly unified.
*—annotation: "Those who followed it could not comprehend it,
and those who comprehended it could not name it—
how could they then discuss its faults?"*—

The **Transmission** says:
*"When Cangjie invented writing,*
*the spirits wept at night,*
*and Heaven rained millet."*
*—annotation: "At that time,*
*the utmost virtue had declined.*
*—annotation: "No one has ever heard of*
*not exhausting the study of virtue and the Dao,*
*yet still calling it ‘good’"*—

**Master Pang** said:
*"Is this the shared Dao/Way of past and present?"*

**Master Lùguān** said:
*"The ancients also made me endure,*
*and the multitude also made me vast—*
*what difference is there?"*
*—annotation: "If aligned with virtue,*
*it shall never be forgotten through ten thousand generations.*
*—annotation: "If aligned with the Dao/Way of evil,*
*calamity shall befall even its own lineage.*
*—annotation: "How could there be any doubt?"*—

**Master Pang** said:
*"Observing the ancient ways through modern affairs,*
*boats and carriages connect,*
*garments share colors,*
*speech is mutually understood,*
*and they mark the earth to defend it,*
*—annotation: "Yet none dare to trespass"*—
**though their rulers differ and their leaders vary,*
*—annotation: "Yet none dare to command others"*—
**and rebellious words are met with death,*
*—annotation: "Armor and weapons are worn for defense"*—
**yet even a hundred generations of parents and children**
*—annotation: "How could they increase or decrease?"*—
**cannot alter it.**
*—annotation: "How could their rulers and leaders differ?"*—

If one can **rectify the singular,**
all nations shall align at the same pole,
and the utmost virtue **shall govern the Four Seas—**
*—annotation: "What need then for unification?"*—

**Master Lùguān** said:
*"If this is indeed true,*
*—annotation: "Then when yin and yang disperse,*
*the 360 days each return to their original order,*
*—annotation: "Heaven and Earth are bound by their natural cycles—*
*how could there be any room for doubt?"*—
*—annotation: "Bound" (局局), narrow and confined"*—
*—annotation: "As the *Mencius* says:*
*‘The height of Heaven, the distance of the stars—*
*if one seeks their original order,*
*even the solstices of a thousand years can be understood while seated.’*"—

The **Sage’s** grandeur and depth
*—annotation: "Within, they grasp the profound logic of deep and shallow, far and near"*—
**pierce the mysteries of divinity and spirit,**
*—annotation: "If even one principle is lost,*
*—annotation: "Lost" (一失), to lose its essence"*—
**and there is no return to stillness.**

The Dao/Way moves yet never halts.
*—annotation: "Its motion is eternal"*—
It **veils Heaven and Earth** while **not ashamed**.
*—annotation: "蔽 (veils/overshadows)"—
*—annotation: "To veil" (蔽), as if a mother enfolding her children*—
*—annotation: "不耻 (not ashamed)"—*
*—annotation: "To veil" (蔽), as if a mother enfolding her children*—
*—annotation: "至今尚在 (still persists today)"—*
*—annotation: "以钲面达行 (through the resonance of the *zhēng* bell)"*—
*—annotation: "钲 (zhēng), a ritual bell"—*
*—annotation: "达行 (reaches its course), harmonizes action"*—
**Doubt it?** It is fitting indeed—
*—annotation: "宜乎哉 (how fitting!)"*—
for the **Great Crow (Chéngjiū)** to span **eighteen thousand years**.
*—annotation: "成鸠 (Chéngjiū), a mythic figure representing primordial unity"—*
*—annotation: "万八千岁 (eighteen thousand years), an age of boundless duration"*—

The **Dao/Way**, indeed,
*—annotation: "夫 (now/indeed), a rhetorical particle emphasizing truth"*—
is the **mother of Heaven and Earth**,
*—annotation: "天地之母 (mother of Heaven and Earth), the primal source"*—
**contracting to refine the self**,
*—annotation: "缩 (contracts), draws inward"*—
**expanding to govern the realm**,
*—annotation: "伸 (extends), reaches outward"*—
**both yielding enduring virtue/power**.
*—annotation: "皆可以长久 (both can endure), their effects are lasting)"*—
This is why **Guangchéngzi** lived **a thousand two hundred years**,
*—annotation: "广成子 (Guangchéngzi), a legendary Daoist sage)"*—
and why **Great Crow (Chéngjiū)** spanned **eighteen thousand years**.
*—annotation: "故 (thus), explaining their longevity)"*—

Hence, it is said: **"Guangchéngzi is called Heaven,"**
*—annotation: "广成子之谓天 (Guangchéngzi is termed Heaven)"*—
**and again, "Great Crow is Heaven."**
*—annotation: "又曰成鸠氏天 (Great Crow is also termed Heaven)"*—
Thus, none can **exalt his grandeur**,
*—annotation: "增 (exalt), raise beyond measure"*—
**or revere his spirit**.
*—annotation: "尊 (revere), honor as divine)"*—
Those who **grasp this Dao/Way**—
*—annotation: "得此道者 (those who attain this Dao)"*—
what need is there to **distinguish whose realm they serve**,
*—annotation: "何辨 (what need to distinguish), discern differences"*—
when the **world is already benefited**?
*—annotation: "而天下利 (yet the world is benefited)"*—

**Apply it, and it is right**; how could one **distinguish who is wrong**?
*—annotation: "用之则是 (apply it, and it is correct)"*—
*—annotation: "安辨孰何 (how could one distinguish who is wrong), rhetorical inversion"*—

---

**Tàihóng the Tenth**,
*—annotation: "泰鸿 (Tàihóng), a mythic sovereign of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors era"*—
**Tàiyī, the Sovereign of Great Unity**,
*—annotation: "泰一 (Tàiyī), the Heavenly Sovereign, Great Emperor"*—
**holds the system of Great Harmony**,
*—annotation: "执大同之制 (adheres to the Great Harmony system)"*—
*—annotation: "制 (system), or 作利 (as profit/benefit)"*—
**Tàiyī differs from none**, hence it is called **"holding the system of Great Harmony."**
*—annotation: "无所不同 (differs from none), universal accord"*—

The **people of Chu forgot their bows**,
*—annotation: "楚人忘弓 (Chu people forgot their bows), metaphor for losing one’s native identity"*—
yet **could not forget Chu**.
*—annotation: "未能忘楚 (yet could not forget Chu), lingering attachment"*—
**Confucius said: "Alas, they have not yet attained Greatness!"**
*—annotation: "惜哉，其未大也 (alas, they have not yet attained Greatness), lamenting partial realization)"*—

**He attunes the *Tàihóng* qi**,
*—annotation: "调泰鸿之气 (attunes the *Tàihóng* qi)"*—
for **Tàiyī is the one who contains the primal qi**.
*—annotation: "含元气者 (one who contains the primal qi), the source of all"*—
*—annotation: "元气 (yuángǐ), primal qi, the undifferentiated breath of Heaven and Earth"*—
*—annotation: "泰鸿 (Tàihóng), the beginning of the primal qi"*—
**the one who rectifies the divine and luminous position**.
*—annotation: "正神明之位者 (rectifies the divine and luminous position)"*—
*—annotation: "神明 (shénmíng), divine luminosity, the radiant intelligence of the cosmos"*—

As the *Nánhuá* says:
*"Heaven is exalted, Earth is humble—*
the **divine and luminous position**."*
*—annotation: "《南华》 (Nánhuá, *Zhuangzi*), the canonical text"*—

Thus, the **Nine Sovereigns received instruction from Fù**,
*—annotation: "九皇受傅 (Nine Sovereigns received instruction from Fù)"*—
*—annotation: "傅 (Fù), the Sage who teaches them"*—
**to seek their origin’s source**.
*—annotation: "以索其然之所生 (to seek their origin’s source)"*—
Fù is called **"one who attains Heaven’s essence."**
*—annotation: "得天之解 (attains Heaven’s essence)"*—
*—annotation: "或作天然之解 (or attains the natural essence of Heaven)"*—
**Not bound by law, nor seeking to escape law.**
*—annotation: "不与法缚 (not bound by law)"*—
*—annotation: "法 (law), the fixed principles of the cosmos"*—
*—annotation: "不求法脱 (nor seeking to escape law)"*—
Fù is called **"one who attains the beginning of Heaven and Earth."**
*—annotation: "得天地之所始 (attains the beginning of Heaven and Earth)"*—

**He generates Heaven and Earth.**
*—annotation: "生天生地 (generates Heaven and Earth)"*—
Fù is called **"the Dao/Way,"** **"the constant of attaining the Dao/Way."**
*—annotation: "傅谓之道 (Fù is called the Dao)"*—
*—annotation: "得道之常 (constant of attaining the Dao)"*—
**Not recklessly calling it constant.**
*—annotation: "不妄曰常 (not recklessly calling it constant)"*—
Fù is called **"the Sage,"**
*—annotation: "傅谓之圣人 (Fù is called the Sage)"*—
for the **Sage’s Dao/Way** aligns with **divine luminosity**,
*—annotation: "圣人之道 (Sage’s Dao)"*—
*—annotation: "与神明相得 (aligns with divine luminosity)"*—
hence it is called **"Dao/Way and virtue/power."**
*—annotation: "故曰道德 (hence it is called Dao/Way and virtue/power)"*—
**Virtue/power is what is attained by this.**

The **Dao/Way** is nowhere absent—
Thus it is said: **Heaven, Earth, and human affairs** are but one in three.

The **Sun** is trustworthy in rising and setting,
With **South and North** having their limits—
This measures the **extremes of direction**.
The **Moon** is trustworthy in death and rebirth,
Advancing and retreating with constancy—
This verifies the **cycles of time**.
When **three fives** are full, when **three fives** are void,
Their **gain and loss** follow a fixed measure.
The **stars** do not stray in their courses,
Alternating in succession without interference—
This confirms the **order of celestial positions**.

The **Twenty-Eight Mansions**, five stations each,
Each with its fixed sequence.
**Heaven’s clarity** is defined by **three** to establish **one**—
*(Explanation follows in the text below.)*
Thus, all things attain their fullness.

Or it is said: **Three times** for growth and lengthening,
**One time** for decline and punishment,
And in **four seasons**, all is settled—
Heaven and Earth are complete.
When things **grow and lengthen**, it is **three**—
Not delayed by **one**.
When they **succumb to punishment**, it is **one**—
Not delayed by **three**.
Thus, the **threefold Dao/Way** is revealed—
None know which is more urgent.

At their **beginning**, things are **tilted and uneven**,
*(Or: vast and boundless.)*
**Tilted and uneven**—the form not yet upright.
When they **take shape**, they are **strained and constrained**,
*(Unable yet to flow with the constant current, hence "strained.")*
When they **achieve form**, they are **upright and sovereign**,
*(Upright—opposite of tilted; sovereign—opposite of constrained.)*
**Do not**—*(or: "Let not")*—**deplete or augment**,
**Youth suffices**—each follows its nature fully,
Without need for aging.
**Above**, follow the **Teacher**;
**Below**, follow the **common ways**.
Do not alter **Heaven’s birth**,
Do not scatter **Heaven’s purity**.
**Stillness** brings clarity,
**Movement** brings turbidity.
The **human heart** is like water in a basin—
If undisturbed, it is level;
If unperturbed, it is clear.
But even a **gentle breeze** passing over it
Makes it impossible to restore its original form.

The **Divine Sovereign** treads the **Winged Position**—
*(The Winged Position: the Heavenly realm.)*
**Before and behind** are **supported**,
**Left and right** are **winged**.
To **align with the Divine Emperor** in **virtue/power**;
*(The Five Celestial Deities are called the Divine Sovereigns; thus, the Divine Emperor refers to the Great Brilliant One.)*
**Adjust the diagram’s center** to reach the **Heavenly Pole**.
**Twofold governance**—*(or: "Upper and lower scrutiny")*—
**Fourfold extension**—*(universal reach to the four quarters.)*
**Intermittent cessation**—*(or: "Upper stillness").*
Responding to **conditions and sensations** without omission,
As previously stated—this is **perfection**.

Yet **movement ceases in stillness**,
**Speech ceases in silence**—
How could one **constantly depart** from this **tranquil state**?

**Returning to the times**, **separating the qi**,
To **fulfill myriad affairs**.
*(Separating: adhering.)*
Take, for example, the **Five Celestial Deities**—
Each **Dao/Way** pervades the five directions,
Yet the **Great Brilliant One** governs **Spring**,
The **Lesser Brilliant One** governs **Autumn**—
Thus, **returning to the times**, **separating the qi**,
To **fulfill myriad affairs**.

**Coming and going**, **observing the balance**—
*(Like a chariot’s yoke, ever upright.)*
**They come here, depart there**, yet **constantly uphold the balance**—
Thus, they align with humanity.
*The Rites say:*
"The **King of the State** gazes with **calm composure**,
The **Great Officer** gazes with **measured balance**."
It is also said:
"When holding the **Son of Heaven’s instruments**, the gaze is **upright**;
When the **King of the State** holds them, the gaze is **level**;
When the **Great Officer** holds them, the gaze is **calm**."
Or it is said: **"Balance"**—like the **beam of a steelyard**—
Its **rise and fall** respond to things—
What room is there for the **heart** to interfere?

The **Five Organs and Six Palaces**,
Their **allocation** follows **Dao/Way**.
Without **hooks or cords**,
In **primordial unity**, undivided.
The **crooked** need no **hooks**,
The **straight** need no **cords**—
Yet **primordial unity** remains whole.
Thus it is said:
**Pluck the six pitches**—
**Blind** the ears of **Shī Guāng**;
**Scatter the five hues**—
**Glue shut** the eyes of **Lí Zhū**;
**Destroy all hooks and cords**—
**Pair the fingers** of **Gōng Tú**—
And only then will **all under Heaven** return to their **primordial simplicity**.

When the **Great Form** is not yet complete,
**Affairs lack structure**.
**Spirits** clash—
And **hundreds of clans** are harmed.
This reveals that **primordial unity** must not be **severed**.

For when **artifice** arises and **truth** dies,
**Primordial unity** is **divided**—
Then **spirits** contend,
And **hundreds of clans** are restless.
*The South华 says:*
"Above, **outshining the brilliance of sun and moon**,
Below, **piercing the spirits of mountains and rivers**."
Does this not refer to this?

**Stealing the harmony of yin and yang** to **sustain their forms**,
Yet **returning** to **align with the times**.
First **determine their advantage**,
Then **await**—**without forcing**—
**Things will come of their own accord**.
**Follow the natural order** with **law**.
When things arrive, they **conform to law**—
This is the **proper instrument of Heaven and Earth**.
If **law is not applied correctly**,
**Mysterious virtue/power** cannot be achieved.
As it is said:
"To **disrupt Heaven’s patterns**,
To **contradict the nature of things**—
**Mysterious Heaven** will not be fulfilled."

The **Supreme Sage** interfaces with **Heaven and Earth**,
*(Sentence structure: "interfaces" as in **interlocking and unbroken**—
Six connections, the **Six Harmonies**.)*
As *Laozi* says:
"The **skilled binder** uses no cords,
Yet **tightly bound**, it cannot be undone."
Thus, **Dao/Way** is achieved.

**Facing south**, holding **governance**,
To **guard the Divine Clarity**—
**Left, right, front, back**,
**Stillness**—*(or: "without attendance")*—**at the center**.
This speaks of the **Sovereign’s non-action**,
While the **ministers** also **do not act**.

**Opening the original flow**, vast as the **ocean’s expanse**,
*(Ocean: like the modern term "洋," the boundless sea.)*
**Subtle essences** flow to and fro—
**Tilted and uneven**, **strained and constrained**,
*(Or: vast and boundless, **strained and constrained**.)*
**Internally**, held by **threads**,
**Externally**, knotted by **ropes**—*(or: "threads")*—
**Guided by principle**, **grasped by end and beginning**,
**Uniting the disparate**, **harmonizing the singular**,
Establishing **five clear officials**—
*(The five officials: the five tones.)*
**Four seasons**, each following their **kind**,
**Tasting the Mysterious**—*(or: "reveling in the Mysterious")*—**to produce color**,
*(The blossoms of spring and summer emerge from the **Mysterious Winter**.)*
**Sounds** are **balanced**—*(balanced: level.)*
The **Eastern Direction**—
Here, **all things stand and cease**.

「Stop, just like planting.
Thus, the **tuning** is with **Zheng**—
The **Southern Direction**, where all things bloom with **feathers**,
Thus, the **tuning** is with **Yu**—
The **Western Direction**, where all things form **patterns**,
Thus, the **tuning** is with **Shang**—
The **Northern Direction**, where all things **record and store**,
Thus, the **tuning** is with **Jue**—
Though **Zheng** belongs to the **Southern Direction**, this **tuning** is applied to the **Eastern Direction** alone,
Not to assign it to the **Eastern Direction** itself.
*(All the following cases are similarly treated.)*
The **Central Direction**, the **position of Taiyi**—
The **Northern Pole**, the **center of Heaven and Earth**,
And its **single luminous point**, the **seat of Taiyi**.
All **spirits** look up to it for **regulation**,
Thus, the **tuning** is with **Gong**—
**Dao** is taken as the **foundation**,
For **Dao** is supreme,
Yet it is further **advanced** as the **foundation**.
The *Records* say:
**Rites**, indeed, originate from **Taiyi**,
And are divided into **Heaven and Earth**,
Transformed into **yin and yang**.
They **elevate and load** the **spirit-brightness**,
Bloom in **Heaven** and **ascend**—
*(Or: "Bloom in all things and ascend to Heaven.")*
Perhaps the name of this **musical chapter** is like *Huanghua* or *Xiyang*.
It **originates** from the **Yellow Bell**,
Beginning with the **Eastern Direction**—
*(All things here **thrive**.)*
With **wood** blooming all things,
The world is **all wood**,
So it is placed in the **Eastern Direction**, presiding over **Spring**.
With **fire** illuminating all things,
The world is **all fire**,
So it is placed in the **Southern Direction**, presiding over **Summer**.
With **metal** cutting all things,
The world is **all metal**,
So it is placed in the **Western Direction**, presiding over **Autumn**.
With **water** sinking all things,
The world is **all water**,
So it is placed in the **Northern Direction**, presiding over **Winter**.
**Earth** is the **great capital**,
The world is **all earth**,
So it is placed in the **Central Direction**, guarding the **land**.
The world is **all people**,
And the **Son of Heaven** is the **proper ruler**.
This means **Taiyi** governs **Heaven** and delegates authority to the **five directions**,
And the **Son of Heaven** administers them.
**Adjusting its qi**—
Adjusting the **qi of the five phases**.
*(Examples: **wood** as warm, **metal** as cool.)*
**Balancing its flavors**—
*(Balancing the flavors of the five phases.)*
*(Examples: **water** as salty, **fire** as bitter.)*
**Hearing its sounds**—
*(Examples: **fire** as sharp, **metal** as harsh.)*
**Rectifying its forms**—
*(Examples: **wood** as round, **earth** as square.)*
**Alternatingly observing the past and present**—
*(Or: "Commanding.")*
Thus, **affairs** can be **followed**—
*(Or: "practiced.")*
**Heaven and Earth** are in **harmony**,
The **past** does not differ from **ancient times**,
The **present** does not differ from **today**,
And when **retrospectively observed**, its **affairs** can be **followed**.
The *Chapter on Near Alternation* says:
*"The teacher has not yet set out, yet the troops can be ordered to march."*
*(This likely refers to the earlier term "alternatingly.")*
The **head and tail** of **Heaven** **reverse their orientation**—
*(Or: "face.")*
**Spring and Summer** come first,
**Autumn and Winter** come after,
Each **direction** has its **orientation**,
How can it be **reversed**?
If the **principles of Earth** **deviate from the classics**,
Then **Heaven’s head and tail reverse their orientation**,
And the **principles of Earth** will **lose their classics**.
**Seize what they love and bring disorder**.
Seize what they desire and **disorder** ensues.
If the **sequence of Heaven** is **disrupted above**,
And the **principles of Earth** **deviate below**,
Then will there be any **humans** who remain **orderly**?
If **Heaven’s patterns** are **extinguished above**,
Then **principles** cannot be **known**.
If **Heaven’s patterns** are **extinguished**, how can the **principles of Earth** be **known**?
Thus, it is said:
**"Patterns and principles mutually illuminate each other."**
**Spirit-brightness** is **lost**.
*(Or: "If.")*
**Deviating from the classics**—
*(Or: "mere patterns")*—**reversing principles**—
*(Or: "fatherly principles")*—
These are the ones that **mutually illuminate**.
**Colors and flavors** are **mutually measured**,
**Ornament and bloom** are **mutually completed**,
*"Ornament"* refers to **patterns**,
*"Ornament"* like the **stems of grass**,
*"Bloom"* like the **flowers of wood**.
The **many**—
If the **many** originate from **my self**,
Then they can be **unified** with a **single standard**.
*(Standard: **Gong**.)*
**Request**—
*(Request: as in "ask for further instruction.")*
If the **many** originate from **my self** and number in the **thousands and ten-thousands**,
Then even their **unification** lies within **my self**.
**Request** with a **single standard**,
And there is **nothing** that cannot be **accomplished**.

「The governance of **affectionate compliance** *(Or: "politics of harmonious love")*—**distinct types mutually accommodate** *(Or: "diverse natures find mutual harmony")*;
*The Liezi* states: *"The tiger and man differ in kind, yet if the tiger curries favor with those who nourish it, that is compliance."*

The governance of **contrary compliance**—**same types mutually perish** *(Or: "like natures mutually annihilate")*.
*The Classic of Transmission* says: *"How do we know that father and son will not become wolves and jackals?"*
Thus, the **Sage** establishes **Heaven as Father** and **Earth as Mother**,
*(Or: "Heaven as Father, Earth as Mother")*—
not to **force** *(Or: "compel")* all to be **identical** *(Or: "the same")*,
but to **know the singular principle** *(Or: "the unified Dao")*
so as to **harmonize one person** *(Or: "guide a single individual")*.

**Permeating** *(Or: "Wandering freely")* **erratically** *(Or: "without fixed bounds")*
between **Heaven and Earth**,
yet **every person** is **enveloped** *(Or: "encompassed")* by its **harmony**.
*(Or: "everyone is nourished by its concord.")*
This means the **Sage** **knows the singular principle** to **harmonize one person**,
and **only the heart** is thus.
*(Or: "yet only the heart is the key.")*

**Permeating** *(Or: "Wandering freely")* **erratically** between **Heaven and Earth**,
every person is **enveloped** by its **harmony**,
not to **force** them to be **identical**.
Thus it is said:
*"The emotion of one person—
that is the emotion of thousands and ten-thousands of people."*

**Harmony** is **formless yet imbued with flavor** *(Or: "taste")*.
**Harmony** is **the Dao**.
Indeed, **the Dao** is **formless yet imbued with flavor**.

**Conformity to harmony** is **Ren** *(Or: "benevolence")*.
**Conformity with the Dao’s harmony**—
**mutual accommodation** *(Or: "intimate closeness")*—is **Yi** *(Or: "righteousness")*.
**Conformity with the Dao’s harmony**—
**mutual accommodation**—is **Yi**.
Indeed, **without the Dao**, **Yi** cannot **accommodate** *(Or: "hold sway")*,
and **without Yi**, **the Dao** cannot **accommodate**.
**Ren and Yi** are **what one delights in** *(Or: "the shared essence of self-naming")*—
**what one delights in** *(Or: "the self-called")*—
**formless internal governance** *(Or: "internalized law")*.
This means: **if one conforms to the delight of Ren and Yi**,
then **government and law**, though they exist, are **truly void within**.
*(Or: "the true emptiness of the heart.")*
Indeed, **what is called "true emptiness"** *(Or: "true void")*—
**that is because there is nothing that does not allow for existence** *(Or: "nothing that hinders being")*.

Thus, the **Sage** **knows the divine method** *(Or: "the divine plan")*,
**adjusting** *(Or: "harmonizing")* **without form**,
and **all things** follow accordingly.
**Heaven** receives **breath and bloom** *(Or: "the vital essence of patterns and splendor")*
as the **root of divine luminosity** *(Or: "the origin of Heaven’s brilliance")*.
**Heaven** receives **the Dao’s vital essence**,
thus **giving birth to divine luminosity**.
*The Liezi* states:
*"The clear and light ascend to become Heaven,
the heavy and turbid descend to become Earth."*

**Earth** receives **time** *(Or: "seasons")*
as the **source of all things**.
**Earth** receives **Heaven’s seasons** to **bear all things**.

**Divine Saints** *(Or: "The Sage and the Divine")*—
*(Or: "The Sage and the Divine, who deeply grasp the principles")*—
*(Or: "The Sage and the Divine, who deeply grasp the principles")*—
**are distant from the grasp of command** *(Or: "hold no sway over life and death")*.
*(Or: "The grasp of command: perhaps omitting *‘are distant from’*")*
*The Laozi* says:
*"Fish cannot be taken from the deep,
sharp tools cannot be shown to the people."*

**Concentrating and dispersing** *(Or: "Refining and dispersing")*
**vital essence and splendor** *(Or: "the vital breath and refined essence")*
to **soothe Earth’s burden** *(Or: "assuage Heaven’s responsibility")*—
*(Or: "to assuage Heaven’s responsibility to Earth")*—
this is **the Divine Sage’s way**.
This means: **the Divine Sage deeply grasps the principles**,
and **thus has means to govern life and death**,
yet **grinds all things to dust** *(Or: "reduces them to powder")* **without causing harm**,
though **soothing Earth’s burden** *(Or: "assuaging Heaven’s responsibility")*—
it is **possible**.

In ancient times, **Laozi** ascended to **destroy the Five Emperors** *(Or: "overthrow the Five Sovereigns")*,
**reaching back to the Three Sovereigns** *(Or: "extending to the Three August Ones")*,
yet **Western Domain’s** *(Or: "the Western Regions’")* **scholars** have **those who shout Buddha and curse the Ancestors**,
are they **near this truth**?
*(Or: "are they close to this?")*

**Adjusting flavors, refining colors, rectifying sounds**,
to **establish** the **three affairs of Heaven, Earth, and Man**—
this is **complete**.

If **the Dao** is as **above** *(Or: "as stated earlier")*,
then **Heaven, Earth, and Man’s affairs**—
how could they **transcend this**?

**The Grand Concordance, Chapter Eleven** *(Or: "The Grand Concordance, Section Eleven")*—
**Entering to discuss the Grand Abyss within** *(Or: "the vastness of the Great Void")*,
**exiting to observe the divine luminosity without**,
**establishing the measure of the Grand Unity’s core**—
*(Or: "the core of the Grand One")*—
**core** *(Or: "the word ‘core’")*—**the central** *(Or: "the middle")*.
**To have no exit nor entry is to establish** *(Or: "the fixed point")*.
**This is to govern all things** *(Or: "to make them conform")*.

**Entering to discuss the Grand Abyss within**,
**exiting to observe the divine luminosity without**,
**establishing the measure of the Grand Unity’s core**—
**this governs all things** *(Or: "to make them conform")*.

**Heaven** has **nine expanses** *(Or: "nine vast regions")*.
*The Record of Lost Recollections* says:
*"Gazing at three cauldrons like heaped rice,
beholding eight expanses as winding belts."*
Scholars say:
*"Eight expanses—
the eight directions’ names.
**Expanses**—**vast and grand** *(Or: "the word ‘expanses’ means ‘vast and grand’")*.
Thus, **the nine expanses** are **perhaps nine encircling regions**?"

**Earth** has **nine provinces**—
*(Or: "this is what Master Zhou [Zhou Dunyi] called the nine provinces")*—
**not the same as Yu’s division**.

**The Grand Unity’s Dao** *(Or: "The Dao of the Grand One")*—
**the transmission of the Nine Sovereigns** *(Or: "the teachings of the Nine August Ones")*—
**I request** *(Or: "I ask")* **its completion at the end of the Grand Beginning** *(Or: "the Grand Origin")*.

**The Grand Unity’s Dao** is **perfected** *(Or: "complete")*,
thus the **upper section** *(Or: "previous chapter")* says:
*"The Nine Sovereigns receive transmission,
to trace where their **‘thusness’** *(Or: "‘so-being’")* originates."*
And now it is said again:
*"Their transmission was perhaps completed at the Grand Beginning"*—
**indeed, without the Grand Beginning, one cannot truly know it**.
The **‘end’**—
**this means to comply with the lower winds and request** *(Or: "to follow the lower currents and ask")*.

**Seeing** *(Or: "Upon seeing")*—
*(Or: "Perhaps omitting *‘seeing’*")*—**the details beyond mere names and principles**,
this means: **only the outline is revealed**,
**yet more must be sought in their convergence**.
Thus the **following text** says:

**Governing without form** *(Or: "The formless standard")*,
**adjusting without flavor** *(Or: "The flavorless adjustment")*—
to **seek the convergence of names and principles**.
**Governing**—**the rectification of form**.
**Adjusting**—**flavor**.
**Rectification**—as in *"covering grievances with their rectification"*—
**this means form is nourished by flavor**.

**Flavor**—**the parent of qi** *(Or: "the parent and mother of qi")*.
If **qi** is insufficient, **supplement it with essence**.
If **essence** is insufficient, **supplement it with flavor**.
**Essence**—*(Or: "perhaps omitting ‘essence’")*—**the subtle and clear** *(Or: "the pure and refined")*—
**the beginning of Heaven and Earth** *(Or: "the origin of Heaven and Earth’s transformation")*.

**Speaking of form, speaking of flavor, yet also speaking of this**—
**this is to seek the convergence of names and principles**,
and **also to attain these three things**.

**Seeing** *(Or: "Perhaps omitting *‘seeing’*")*—**form ground into mincemeat** *(Or: "form butchered")*,
**yet all under Heaven call it beautiful**—
**this is the Great Dao** *(Or: "the right path")*.

**Erratic movement** *(Or: "Misaligned actions")*—**harmonizing intentions** *(Or: "uniting wills")*,
**supporting righteousness** *(Or: "upholding Yi’s foundation")*—**Ren is its root** *(Or: "its origin is Ren")*.
**Accumulating what compliance brings** *(Or: "The accumulated fruit of compliance")*—
**this is what the ancient Sages produced**.

**Those who walk the Dao** have **its name**,
**those who perform its deeds** have **its function**.
This means: **the governance of Ren and Yi**,
thus **those who walk the Dao** have **its name**,
**those who perform its deeds** have **its function**.

If **the Sage** has **no name**,
and **the Divine Person** has **no function**,
**riding upon virtue and power** *(Or: "surfing the Dao and its transformations")*,
**wandering freely above all things**—
then **how could they be confined to the domain of Ren and Yi**?

Thus the **following text** says:
Hence, **Heaven and Earth** are **completed in the Original Qi** *(Or: "the Primordial Void")*,
and **all things** **ride upon Heaven and Earth**,
**Original Qi**—**the Great Emptiness** *(Or: "the Grand Primordial")*.
The **Great Emptiness** contains **Heaven and Earth**,
**Heaven and Earth** contain **all things**,
thus **its words** are such.

**Divine Saints** **ride upon** *(Or: "hold fast to")* **virtue and power**,
*(Or: "as in *Zhuangzi*’s ‘without blame or praise, like a dragon or a snake’")*—
to **investigate their principles**.
*(Or: "Perhaps: ‘to rescue their divine essence, to investigate the principles of Heaven, Earth, and all things.’")*

If the **Supreme Sage**—the **August Heavenly Sovereign**—is the **First Sage’s** foundation of **威威** *(威: awe/authority)* and **establishment of command**,
then **Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, and the Three Dynasties’** edicts never failed to invoke **Heaven**—
for they relied solely on **威威** and **command**.

But when it comes to **achieving governance** in its own right,
how could it depend on **Heaven**?
This is something **within oneself**.
This is how **King Zhou** falsely invoked **the Supreme Deity** to no avail in his chaos.

Thus the **following text** says:
**Achieving governance** lies within oneself.
**Summon the lofty**, and it rises;
**summon the lowly**, and it descends.
This speaks of governance’s **corruption or flourishing**—
it depends on how **one summons it**.

There has never been one **confined to the humility of Guan Zhong and Yan Ying**
who could summon the **loftiness of Yao and Shun**.

Thus, **what is formed yet unchanging** is **measure** *(度)*;
**what remains external yet within oneself** is **familiarity with chaos** *(狎沤)*#39.
As in **familiarity with chaos**—
when the heart stirs within, the **chaos-black** *(沤乌)* dances yet does not descend—
this is **what remains external yet within oneself**.

**Establishing form and principle** unaltered for ten thousand generations—
this is the **position of Heaven and Earth**.
**Distinguishing things by name**, with **patterns and principles clearly marked**—
this is the **harmony of the Divine Saints**.
*Harmony*, as in **leveling measures**.

**Conforming to Heaven, dwelling on Earth**,
**abandoning the square, embracing the round** *(or: **supervising**)*#40.
The **square** by **intelligence** becomes **obstructed**,
the **round** by **spirit** becomes **flowing**.
This is the **mirror of the Divine Saints**.

**Embodied forms and named things**—
**imitating them** is **embodiment** *(象)*,
**discussing them** is **explanation** *(说)*.
**Accomplishing deeds and completing affairs**—
**hidden and manifest** never separate—
the **teaching of the Divine Saints**,
**neither immediate nor distant**,
yet where **the utmost subtlety converges**, the **coarsest** prevails;
where **the utmost height reaches**, the **lowest** returns.
**Hidden and manifest**—how could they separate?
This is the **teaching of the Divine Saints**.

**Heaven** holds one position,
**Earth** holds one position,
and the **Sage harmonizes** between the two.
**Harmonizing**, using **one to mirror the other**,
using **this to teach that**—
then the **principles of the world** are attained.

Only then do **all things fulfill their nature**.
Thus the **following text** says:
**When the flow divides, spirit is born**—
*Flow divides* refers to **water**.
**Heaven’s One** generates **water**,
and its **essence** in things is **precision**.
**Precision** gathers, then **spirit** follows.

**When movement ascends, clarity is born**—
*Movement ascends* refers to **fire**.
**Earth’s Two** generates **fire**,
and its **spirit** in things is **divine essence**.
**Divine essence** converges, then **awareness** follows.

**Clarity reveals form**,
**form establishes function**.
Thus, **patterns** are what **distinguishes things**,
**principles** are what **names or records them**#40.
**Heaven and Earth** are **cooperative yet distinct in domain**—
**Heaven’s domain** is above,
**Earth’s domain** is below.
**Without a compass**, the **round** is **Heaven’s pattern**,
**without a square**, the **straight** is **Earth’s principle**.
**Heaven** follows **patterns** in motion,
**Earth** follows **principles** in creation.
These two **ends** *(or: **Sage-ends**)* are **the law of spirit**#41.
The **law of spirit and clarity** is as such.

The **Sage-person**—
**later than Heaven and Earth yet more honored**—
**later than Heaven and Earth in birth**,
yet **knows their beginning**;
**earlier than Heaven and Earth in death**,
yet **knows their end**.
**The Way** encompasses them;
thus **they know measure**;
their **Way** encircles **outside Heaven and Earth**,
so **they know what can be known**,
**what can be measured**.
**Honored and weighty**,
they **can alter motion** *(or: **without motion**)*;
**transcend yin and yang**, **shift cold and heat**.
**Keen** *(or: **numerous**)* in **clarity**,
they **can judge and decide**.
**Spirit-essence** is the **most noble and vast** of things;
**outside spirit-essence**, all else is **its residual dross**.
**Inner Sagehood** is the **source of spirit-essence**;
**outer kingship** is its **residual dross**.
Thus **Inner Sagehood** is the **source of spirit-essence**—
none is more noble, so **all defer to its governance**.
**Governance** is what **protects essence, elevates spirit, and refines qi**.
**Essence** desires **frugality**,
**spirit** desires **nurturing**,
**qi** desires **unity**—
thus the **language** is as such.
*Elevate* means **to excel and surpass**.

**Secluded**, it does not **leak**;
**heard**, it does not **weary**—
not wearying, **essence and clarity** reach through.
**Clarity overused** becomes **dim**,
**essence overused** becomes **exhausted**.
Thus they **command the capable**,
**make them spirit-bright**—
**without action**,
they **can employ the world with surplus**.
**Hundred transformations** follow and change,
**beginning and end** proceed and **foresee**#42.
*Foresee* means **leisurely ease**.

**Spirit-clarity** is the **accumulation of refined essence**,
**Sage-Way** is the **ultimate convergence**#43.
**Essence** gathers, **spirit** forms—
**this is the extreme**.
**Imperial decree, divine transformation**—
this is the **goal of governance**.
**Utmost**, **exhausted**—
nothing more can be added.
Thus **the teacher** *(or: **the ruler**)* **as sovereign**,
**the student** *(or: **the subject**)* **as minister**.
The **highest virtue** becomes **Emperor**,
the **next virtue** becomes **the Three Ministers**,
the **highest rank** becomes **the feudal lords**.
**High rank** is what **makes them feudal lords**.
**Changing surnames to rule**,
not **using ancestral records** *(or: **rites**)* as **sovereigns**—
they **seek uniformity in the security of goodness**.
**Yao passed rule to Shun**,
**Shun passed rule to Yu**—
this is the **Way** they used.

**Heaven and Earth’s movements** stir within the **chest**,
then **deeds are accomplished externally**;
**all things emerge and return**,
then **harmony follows without harm**.
The **Sage’s heart** has **no external law**,
yet **qi aligns with spirit**,
**spirit aligns with the Void**.
**Heaven and Earth’s vastness**, **all things’ multitude**—
their **movements, emergences, returns** all within the **chest**,
then **how could deeds fail to succeed**,
**how could things fail to prosper**?

**Opening and closing the four seasons**,
**guiding yin and yang’s shifts**,
**drowning grievances**, **clarifying things**—
*(doubtful)*
**The world** assumes it is **natural**,
**the people** say, *“This is how it is of itself.”*
This is how the **Divine Saints surpass all others**.

**Zigong** said:
*“Master Kong is Heaven—
one cannot ascend by steps.”*
**Sagehood’s root** is **spirit-pattern**,
**verified yet unseen**.
**Emotion and nature** exist,
**without action, without form**.
Thus **exceeding others is visible**,
**transcending others is not distant**.

The *Nanhua* [1] asks: *"When traveling southward, one reaches Ying [2].
Facing north, yet not seeing the Ming Mountains [3]—why is that?
It is because one is far removed from them.
This is how the **Divine Saints** align in kind.*

Thus, the **Divine Saints** bind and knot their **threads** [4],
**Zhuan** [5] takes analogy from the **cap** [6],
while binding and knotting the clouds [7] serves to make clear
there is no fear of **precipitous fall** [8].
Kind upon kind brings forth creation,
**using the One without exhaustion** [9].
Or, **One acts, exhausting all uses** [10].
This is what is called **Zhongni’s** [11] **Divine Luminance** [12]:
small things **prosper small things**, great things **prosper great things**,
down to **mountains, rivers, crows, beasts, grasses, and trees**—
**abundant and effortless** [13].

**Shadows** follow **forms**,
**echoes** either **arise in response to sounds** [14]—
thus, **forms and sounds** are **Heaven and Earth’s models** [15].
They follow and respond in kind,
hence they are called **models**.
The **functions of the four seasons** [16],
**yin and yang** cannot **single-handedly** fulfill [17].
The **Sage Kings** [18],
do not lose **beginning and end** [19],
thus the **Divine Luminance** **endures from start to finish** [20].
They **assist, guide, and lead** [21]
**yin and yang** in their **start-to-finish functions** [22]
and the **four seasons’ operations** [23].
**Ultimately**, the **changes of the eight winds** [24],
the **three luminaries** [25],
or the **swirling *qi* that is not constant** [26]—
who does not **revere and follow** [27]?
*"Revere"* means **to gather** [28],
read as in *dūbǐ* [29].
This says that **people** **protect** the **Sage** [30],
so when **yin and yang** lose **harmony**,
they **summon and request** [31] him
to **gather and oversee** [33].
Even so, the **root of great disorder** [34]
truly **begins here**.
This is why **Gengsang Chu** [35] **refuses to let go** of Lao Dan’s words.
Hence, the following text says:

Thus, **Divine Spirits** **radiate** with **Awe-Luminance** [36],
**Lao Dan’s** *"Awe-Luminance above"* [37] **contradicts the brightness of sun and moon** [38].
**Swift and slow, relaxed and urgent**—
**the *qi* moves within** [39].
**Lao Dan’s** *"Within, it falls from the four seasons’ application*" [40].
**Extinguishing, harming, ruining, and bringing disaster** [41]—
**below, it scatters the essence of mountains and rivers** [42].
**Lao Dan’s** *"Below, it dissipates the **vitality** of mountains and rivers*" [43].
Thus, **Heaven and Earth’s** **yin and yang** **receiving their mandate** [44],
**take their models** from the **Divine Saints’** **manifestations** [45],
which have already been **seen**.
Their **effects**, as described above,
have also been **seen**.
Even so, **can one truly dispense with the Sage’s governance** [46]?
Hence, the following text says:

**Heaven** is where **the *qi*** **collectively emerges** [47];
**rainbows**, **frost and dew**, **winds and rains**—
these are **accumulated *qi*** **forming Heaven** [48].
**Earth** is where **principles** **must necessarily** [49] **be** [50].
**Without limits, without prohibitions** [51],
this is the **Dao of Heaven** [52].
The **Dao of Earth** then **takes necessity** [53].
Thus, the **Sage** **emerges from Heaven** [54],
his **Dao** always **emerges from Heaven** [55].
**He confines it to Earth** [56].
He **does not allow it to emerge from Earth** [57].
Within **Heaven and Earth**, like **yin and yang** [58],
he **blocks dryness and dampness** [59] **with righteousness** [60],
**adapting with the times** [61].
Or, **without the word "thus"** [62],
**if yin**, he **blocks dryness with righteousness**,
**if yang**, he **blocks dampness with righteousness** [63].
**Du Wan** [64] says:
*"If **Divine Dampness** [65] arises, **Heaven** will not **generate water** [66].
If **forms become dry**, **Earth** will not **generate fire** [67].
These three** [68],
the **Sage** either **preserves** [69] **or** **loses** [70]—
**Heaven loses its *pattern***, **Earth loses its *principle*** [71].
**By this**, one **knows the former spirits** [72]—
the **former spirits**, the **spirits of the ancient kings** [73].
**The kings** who **embody all things** [74],
**hold the supreme virtue** and **grasp the Great Dao** [75].
All these are **the leaders of things** [76].
**Until** the **world of Zuji’s** [77] **descendants**,
who **inherit** the **ruling position**,
though their **bodies** are not **virtuous** [78],
yet **facing south** [79] **and claiming sovereignty** [80]
still **do not utterly perish** [81],
it is because they **can accept teachings** from **scholars of the Dao** [82].
Otherwise, **to guard ancestral temples** and **preserve the state** [83],
there has never been such a case.

Things have their own reciprocating strengths, hence water and fire can be utilized.
East, west, south, and north—thus the forms and names can be trusted.
Once there are fixed methods, then forms and names are firmly established.

The Five Sages came before, the Three Kings after; when the virtue/power above declines, martial arts and knowledge both arise.
The Yellow Emperor fought a hundred battles—yet the full count of his wars is unknown.
It is said he fought the Yan Emperor three times at the wilds of Bàn Quán (阪泉), and Chiyou seven and twenty times at Zhúlù (涿鹿)—these are the rough outlines.
Chiyou’s *"seven and twenty"*—some say it lacks the two characters *"无"* (without).

Yao subdued Yǒu Táng (有唐).
*The Commentary* says: *"Yao assisted Emperor Zhì, receiving the fief of Táng, and at twenty years ascended the throne."*
Now it says *"Yao subdued Yǒu Táng"*—this is unclear.
*"Subdued"* may also be read as *"replaced"* (代).

Yú’s service—some read *"subdued Yǒu Miáo"* (伐有苗)—
Heaven does not alter its constancy,
Earth does not change its norms,
Yin and Yang do not disrupt their *qi*,
Life and death do not shift their order,
The Three Luminaries do not vary their functions,
The spirit and brilliance do not abandon their laws.
Thus, the adept martial artist follows the Dao/Way in this manner.

Gain and loss do not exist in duality,
Success and failure do not stand in opposition.
What is called *"the virtuous and the unvirtuous"*—this is the same in ancient and modern times.

The gentleman does not grow weary,
The true person does not slacken#1.
Slackening leads to dissolution,
Dissolution leads to ruin—
Hence the gentleman speaks of *"ruin"*,
The true person speaks of *"slackening."*
*The Rites* say: *"Three days without slackening, three months without dissolution."*
Never does one see long-term poverty or lowliness.

Then there is the case of Yī Yǐn (伊尹), the wine steward of Jiān (简), who later became a minister;
and the case of the Duke of Tào (太公), the butcher of cattle, who later became a world teacher.
*The Commentary* says: *"The Duke of Tào was young and poor, selling milk, when the weather turned cold;
he sold meat as a butcher, but when the weather grew hot, the meat spoiled."*
Guan Zhòng made armor or grass mats,
and Bǎilǐ Xī (百里奚) served as a slave.
Bǎilǐ Xī was a man of Yú (虞)—when Yú fell, the Jin lord humiliated him, forcing him to cook meals for Mù Jī (穆姬), and later to tend cattle in Qin. Was this truly the *"slave"* spoken of?

When the world falls into chaos,
one rises as its teacher—
all act with Heaven and Earth’s sage-like counsel.
The sun and moon never cease,
thus the four seasons are perfected—
through meticulous practice and mastery of forms,
one attains the spirit’s likeness.
*The Nán Huá* (南华) says: *"The ironworker’s art astonishes the beholder like the appearance of ghosts and gods."*
Is this what is meant?

Who can say they possess such ability?

The spoken is not from innate ability without learning.
One must first cultivate its use,
then understand its origins.
This is what is meant by:
beginning with origins,
nurturing through nature,
fulfilling through destiny.

Tang could overthrow Jie with seventy *li*,
King Wu could subdue Zhou with a hundred *li*—
knowing one principle, no need for excess;
knowing one principle, simplicity follows.

A thousand schemes and myriad complexities,
all blending into uniformity—
when gathered under a singular essence,
they cannot differ.

The Dao of victory is not singular;
the methods of conquest are not confined to one path.
The wise calculate comprehensively—
in battle, they must prevail;
in assault, they must seize.
A sagely commander does not abandon advantage for the sake of time,
nor does a brave warrior fear death to extinguish his reputation.

Those who seek to surpass the utmost virtue
must think differently from the common crowd.
Conforming to the crowd brings sickness of the mind;
to surpass the utmost virtue is difficult indeed.

To verify the height of the Nine Heavens,
one does not walk a shortcut—
how can one reach it by asking for directions?
The Nine Heavens are fully revealed in the *Honglie Zhenjing*.
Thus, the southern realm is called the Vermilion Heaven,
the northern realm the Dark Heaven,
the central realm the Hooked Heaven, and so forth.

Therefore, loyal ministers do not prioritize themselves over their lord,
yet when isolated and abandoned,
they become suspended generals—
in open battle, the nation weakens and the people exhaust;
in city defense, they consume flesh and roast bones.
Some even boil children for food,
chopping corpses to cook.
When strategy fails,
the state is diminished, the ruler constrained,
and they become the laughingstock of the world.
Those who manage state affairs—
how can they afford to be careless?

There are indeed errors in calculation,
and there are trials—
trials may fail through negligence,
encounters may fail through overrefinement;
what matters is striking the balance.
Thus, Cao Mǐ served as Ru’s general,
fighting three battles against Qi and losing a thousand *li*.
Had Caozi not considered the aftermath,
and instead died by his own hand,
he would have been no more than a defeated general, a captured commander.
But Caozi reasoned:
a defeated general is not courageous;
a diminished state and ruined name are not wise;
dying while the lord is in peril is not loyal.
Those who die for others cannot prolong another’s life,
so he withdrew to advise the Ru lord.

When Duke Huan assembled the feudal lords,
Caozi seized the duke by the throne with a single sword,
his expression unchanging, his words unflinching.
The lost lands were recovered in a day,
shaking the world, startling the neighbors,
and his name echoed through the ages.
Had he clung to petty resentment,
great deeds would not have been accomplished.
Thus, Caozi abandoned transient anger
to establish a lifelong legacy,
discarding minor shame
to earn renown for generations.
Hence, Caozi understood the times,
and the Ru lord knew his men.

Ju Xin served as Yan’s general,
fought against Zhao, and lost the battle.
Ju Xin took his own life,
and Yan lost five cities.
He opened the door to disaster for himself,
died while endangering his lord,
and his name and reputation perished—
this was failure,
a strategy without foresight.
It was not a lack of ability,
but rather a disregard for preserving life.
Though Cao Mǐ’s actions coincided with Guan Zhong’s era,
he did not seek short-term gratification
but instead ensured Qi’s credibility among the feudal lords,
thus fulfilling his reputation.

As for Li Ling’s surrender,
he sought to repay Han
but ultimately saw his entire clan exterminated,
and the men of Longxi regarded it as shame.
How could Caozi’s bold action be considered ordinary?
Much less for a conqueror’s deeds.

As for those of *Wangde*’s virtue,
whose sincerity and clarity are innate,
they would not condemn Mǐ to death in Ru’s lands—
what is there to praise in that?

Those who attain the Dao strive to avoid great failure;
ordinary people strive for minor virtues.
Minor virtues accumulate into many vices,
many vices prevent the accumulation of virtue,
and without accumulation, misfortune follows—
some say many vices bring many misfortunes.
Misfortune brings turbidity,
turbidity brings ignorance.
Excessive desires lead to narrowness,
narrowness breeds many worries,
many worries bring turbidity,
turbidity brings ignorance.
Desires and vices—
these are what obscure wisdom.

The powerless are shamed,
and shame is disgrace.
Thus, Ju Xin could sever his fate,
yet the Yan king failed to discern talent.

In ancient times, skilled warriors
mustered armies in unison,
arrayed them according to the Five Phases,
fought with the Five Notes,
pointed to the celestial pole,
aligned with the divine,
and from this, all things took form—
using one principle without exhaustion.
The enlightened established the method,
the subtle Dao was put into practice,
advancing and retreating in harmony—
*harmony* means not overstepping.
Combining with Heaven and Earth,
emerging from substance to touch emptiness,

Wu fled southeast, while General Jia Fu prepared for the northwest—clearly understanding this truth.

When an army is about to break, its movements are swift as arrows loosed or crossbow bolts, thunderous as thunder and lightning, fierce as a collapsing wall. The soldiers grasp their weapons tightly, their stances rigid—*The Art of War* says: *"When their grip is firm, their stance is short."* Their actions are unyielding, avoiding my death ground, seeking my life ground, advancing when the time is ripe, seizing opportunities—*or* lending strength to my advantages. Thus, the soldiers never falter in retreat, the army never finds itself in dire straits.

He who masters this Dao can drive even common folk like cattle, ride the current as if gliding—*or* soar with the Dao. Soaring and seizing, securing and defending—*or* preparing defenses; breathing in and out—*or* adjusting and shifting—*stillness without movement.* Aligning with the rhythm of time, one step forward, one step back, like musical notes in harmony—*or* in service. One to the right, one to the left—*the Dao knows no impossibility.*

Receiving measure from Heaven, establishing position on Earth, attaining form through humanity. When the moment arrives, how can it be undone?—*or* how can its return be forced? *Return* means reversal; *stillness* means withdrawal. How can it be restrained or grasped? *Restrained* means drawn back; *grasped* means held fast. *Stillness* speaks of the ungovernable; *restraint* speaks of the unchecked.

Heaven and Earth do not lean—*they shift in response to ability.* Measures interact, yin and yang contend, death and life constrain, qi and power annihilate, emptiness and substance depend on each other, gain and loss drift—*or* float indeterminately. *Floating indeterminately* means without fixed form. War is won by advantage—*The Art of War says:* *"Like rolling a round stone down a thousand-zhang mountain, that is advantage."* Time does not always favor one side; early or late, one may falter while the other thrives, each generating the other’s strength. Change is boundless—how can it be fully spoken?

Water struck becomes dry; an arrow struck flies farther. Spirit vibrates and thins, oscillating in turn. Slowness and speed are fated—*fated* means *halted* or *ceased.* It must strike the three ranks. *Three ranks* refers to the three divisions of an army. Gathering and dispersing, ebbing and flowing—who can know the moment?

The perfected transcends things—*or* does not cling to them—moving alone with the Dao, unrestrained, abandoning fate, coming and going with time. Rise and decline, life and death—who can know their measure? Solemn and profound, who can fathom their depth? Calamity is the reverse of fortune; fortune is the reverse of calamity. Calamity and fortune are intertwined like twisted cords. *Three strands twisted together make a cord.* Chaos and confusion—its form is singular, yet shapes dissolve and reform. Who knows their pattern?

Without form or boundary—*or* root—only the Sage can discern its intent—*or* is able to discern its intent. Flowing and shifting, it never rests. *A brief pause is called rest.* Ending leads to beginning—who knows its limit?

A net with one eye cannot catch a sparrow—*too sparse.* A bird in a cage only peers out—*too dense.* The common crowd murmurs in agreement—how can they settle fortune and calamity? Joy and sorrow gather at the gate; good and ill share the same domain. *Mourners at the door while guests feast in the hall.* Loss becomes gain; success becomes failure.

Wu had mighty armies and strong forces—yet King Fu Zhi was brought low. Yue took refuge in Kuaiji—yet King Gou Jian became a hegemon. The enlightened observer sees the truth. *Truth* or *harshness.* A single technique—how can it suffice for roaming?

*Elliptical and square*—what use are they for adaptability? *Elliptical* is read like *Sui Dù’s* "Sui"; *square* like *Fāng Biàn’s* "Fāng." The affairs of the world demand a hundred responses, each varying to meet a hundred changes. Yet now, clinging to one technique—how can it suffice in the realm of adaptability?

From ancient times to now, what event lacks its counterpart? *Counterpart* means *a station for relaying messages.* Travelers pass through it without pause; thus, past events are called *counterparts.* Shun had unfilial conduct; Yao lacked tenderness. King Wen was bound in chains; Guan Zhong was imprisoned. Towering and vast—*or* buried in clouds—who can grasp it?

This speaks of the Great Pivot dispersing things—towering and vast without boundary, all within the *Lǔ* vessel—who can grasp it? The perfected has no partiality, drifting like an untethered boat—*simply yielding.* The capable are saved; the incapable are destroyed. Heaven cannot be schemed with; Earth cannot be plotted against. The Sage abandons things, follows nature, and lets go.

The common crowd is confined—*confined* means *narrow and shallow*—pressured by desires. The slightly wise rush to act, fearing good and evil. The arrogant die by their power, boasting in self-importance—*or* spending their lives scheming for fame. *One version omits:* "The scholar pursues fame; the greedy man pursues wealth. To chase after things with one’s body is called *serving* them."

The most expansive lacks sufficiency—*or* is bound. Governing without a key, even vastness becomes insufficient. Why? The Supreme Dao is ever concise.

The wise know time—what shame is there in that?
They feel no guilt, yet do nothing wrong.
The unworthy are bound by convention—*or, as one version reads, "enveloped by custom"*—
while the virtuous vie for influence in their age.
Knowledge is but the tool of contention.
Fame is but the clash of reputations.
*One version reads "clings to trifles," another "clings to the vulgar,"*
and yet another, *"clings to petty matters"*—*both versions imply "like a bitter herb or thorn."*

What need is there to doubt?
When deeds are done and rewards sought, what need is there to boast?
This speaks of harmony with the Way and its opposite—
there is no cause for joy or sorrow.

Thousands of words and ten thousand arguments—
in the end, what praise is given?
This means that reason is fully exhausted above,
yet even if their verbose arguments pile up to thousands or ten thousands,
still they must be judged by this.

Gōu Jiàn lacked office,
Gōu Jiàn once served as a subject to Wú.
Two kingdoms remained unsettled;
Wén Wáng lacked confinement,
*yet he was confined in Měilǐ*.
Wǔ Wáng lacked rectitude—*or, as one version reads, "did not hold to rectitude"*—
Guān Zhòng suffered no humiliation,
yet his name was not equated with the great virtuous,
and his deeds were not compared to the Three Sovereigns#16.
The *tāng* face is complete.

*Complete knowledge is the thirteenth chapter.*
Heaven is vast yet can be known,
Earth is great yet can be governed.
How can all things be at ease?
How can human nature be without taking?
Bó Yí and Shū Qí could prevent theft,
yet they could not stop people from harboring intentions against themselves.
*Can one be certain of meeting only adversity?*
Shēn Tú Dì.

The decline of the Yin dynasty was marked by withering and decay.
He deemed the world’s corruption too deep to endure,
so he bore a stone and cast himself into the river—
yet he failed to see that the chaos beneath was even worse.

When virtue flourished,
mountains lacked paths, marshes lacked bridges—
no travel between them, no passage by boat or cart.
Why?
Because its people remained as pure as infants.
*As Laozi says:*
*"Thick with virtue, like an infant."*
Males were called *chīzǐ*, females *yīng’ér*.
The wise did not deceive or enslave one another,
the strong did not lord over others as rulers.
Thus, the nests of crows and magpies could be glimpsed from below,
and the timid deer and startled elk could be easily captured.
*Crows and magpies are naturally suspicious,*
*deer and elk are naturally skittish*—
this explains the saying.

Yet when the age declined,
fathers plotted against sons, brothers doubted brothers.
Fathers and sons are by nature,
brothers by kinship—
trust and sincerity were innate, not imposed from without.
Thus, even when striking a stranger’s foot, one would feign stumbling,
and when striking a brother’s, one would feign hitting an old woman—
such was the extent of their kinship.
But when virtue waned to the point where fathers and sons became rivals,
brothers turned against one another—
was this because their nature had fundamentally changed from antiquity?
No, it was the fault of governance.
For when cultivation grew shallow and reliance on artificial means took hold,
they could not coexist without strife,
nor act without scheming—
and so their ruin reached this point.

Guo Xiang remarked:
*"Those who embody Heaven and Earth, who subtly transform without effort—
though hands and feet have distinct roles,
and the five viscera govern differently,
they never conspire to disrupt harmony,
yet all limbs move in unison—
this is to coexist without contrivance.
They never scheme to aid one another,
yet the outer and inner both thrive—
this is to act without scheming.
But if one forces the mind to labor for the limbs,
or strains the arms to nourish the viscera,
then the more they strive, the more exhausted they become within and without.
This is the truth."*

Thus, those who *do* bring ruin,
those who *govern* bring chaos.
Chaos leads to factionalism—*fǎn*—
factionalism leads to flattery—*ē*—
flattery undermines principle,
and servility erodes righteousness.

When Yao passed the Mandate to Shun,
the virtuous saw it as Yao’s wisdom,
but the self-interested saw it as folly.
Tang and Wu abandoned their sons for profit—
the virtuous condemned them as unprincipled.
*But why?*
If my teachings are correct,
then only the virtuous would deem them righteous,
while the self-interested would call them wise.
*For* in that age, the worthy were not transmitted,
so there were exiled rulers.
When rulers favored factionalism and flattery,
there were regicides.
Where exiles and regicides struck,
there the state perished—
I have never seen one who, seeing the danger,
found comfort in false security,
or, clinging to sorrow, diminished joy.

Thus, states could face mourning without ritual,
warfare without soldiers—
such outcomes could be foreseen.

Hence, Ji Zi fled—
*not to escape, but to avert calamity.*
Confucius said:
*"Miczi departed, Ji Zi became his slave."*
Yet there was also *Bóqiú Mù*—
*as the Song Genealogy records:*
*"Nan Gong Wan slew Duke Min at Mengze Marsh.
The minister Bóqiú Mù, hearing of it,
led soldiers to the duke’s gate.
Wan attacked Mù, who died with his teeth lodged in the door."*
This was the reality.

Shang Rong was imprisoned,
and Shěn Shù wept.

Shěn Shù was a subject of Qin. When Duke Mu of Qin attacked Zheng, Shěn Shù wept for it.

In ancient times, those who climbed high places—
when others below took their place,
some wrote *yù* (殪), meaning *fright* (怖).
The hands and feet would sweat from fear,
and those above, though trembling, knew no dread,
yet only then would they clutch and break branches,
hasten and grasp wood.

To stop them was to suffer mutilation,
and those who tried to halt them—
they themselves bore the punishment.

All this illustrates those in peril who forget security,
while advisors suffer disgrace.

Thus, the world grows cold-hearted,
and rulers stand alone.

Nowadays, those in precarious positions are all traitors—
their wit suffices to mislead their lords,
their words to undermine governance,
their factions to nurture mutual gain and harm.

In the past, Tang used Yi Yin,
Zhou used Tai Gong,
Qin used Bai Li—Bai Li Delin.
Chu used Shen Bao Xu,
Qi used Guan Zhong.

These great ministers—
by whom the age was elevated—
were all loyal subjects of ruined states,
who died for them.

This shows that ancient talents were equal:
some rose to prominence,
others died—
it depended on the ruler they encountered.

To observe this:
it was not their wisdom or ability that failed,
but the fate of their times that could not be reached.

This speaks of the talents of Yi, Lü, Shen, and Guan—
no one was beyond their reach—
yet Ji Zi and Bóqiú Mù met with death and humiliation,
for they lacked the right fate.

Only thus—
only thus—
was their fate denied.

When the **Way** reaches its moment, one may **seek**—
or act as **Yuan**,
or as **Biao**.

When there is a ruler but no minister,
even when the **Way** reaches its moment,
the minister **seeks** from above.

When the **Way** reaches its moment, one may **withdraw**—
when there is a minister but no ruler,
even when the **Way** reaches its moment,
the minister **withdraws** below.

When **fate** reaches its moment, one may **close**—
or act as **He**.

*Close* is like *withdraw*.
When **fate** reaches its moment, one may **open**—
or act as *Que*.
*Open* is like *seek*.

The virtuous do not necessarily meet their time,
the unvirtuous do not necessarily lose their fate—
thus, the virtuous **guard the Way**,
while the unvirtuous **guard fate**.
*Guard fate* is like *entrusting to fate*.

In this age, there are those with Shun’s conduct,
yet they do not know the reason for Yao’s rise;
there are those with Tang and Wu’s deeds,
yet they do not know the reason for Yi Yin and Tai Gong’s rise.

Fei Zhong and E Lai gained from Xin Zhe’s favor,
yet they did not know that Wu Wang would conquer him;
Ji Gan and Wu Zixu loved loyal admonition,
yet they did not know their lords would kill them.

Fei Zhong and E Lai could be said to know the heart,
yet they did not know the circumstances;
Ji Gan and Wu Zixu could be said to know the circumstances,
yet they did not know the heart.

The sage must possess both—
only then can they master an age.

**Chapter Fourteen: On Warfare**

Pangzi asked Lüguanzi:
*"The laws of warfare—
heaven’s, earth’s, and humanity’s—
reward to encourage battle,
punish to ensure the multitude.
Some say ‘terrify the multitude.’

When these five are applied,
yet the Nine Barbarians use them and victory is not certain—
why is this so?

They have obtained the battle,
but not the reason for battle—
thus, the Nine Barbarians use them and victory is not certain.*

As the saying goes:
*'One who drives a chariot by the book
does not fully grasp the horse’s nature.'*

This is what is meant.

Thus it is said:
*'When the master gallops, the horse gallops;
when the master trots, the horse trots;
when the master races and leaves dust behind,
the horse gazes back in bewilderment.'*

Is this not so?

Lüguanzi said:
*'Things have their nature—
*nature*, like *transformation*.
Thus, before they are used, metal, wood, water, and fire restrain one another.
This is called *prevailing before the appointed time*.*

Have you not seen the gate?
If you stand and lean against it,
even a woman can lift it.
If you kneel and place it,
it can be raised without regard to strength.
If you grasp its handle,
even a chosen warrior cannot sever the ground.

Though the gate is but one body,
its weight differs by how it is held—
this is because the method determines it.

Speaking of the gate,
its nature is in the hand that holds it.
The Nine Barbarians use it and victory is not certain—
because they do not grasp the nature of things.

As the *Su Wen* says:
*'The generation of things is called transformation,
their extreme is called change.'*

If one grasps the generation of things,
the five become one.

Pangzi said:
*'How can the five become one?'*

Lüguanzi said:
*'Heaven cannot make early into late,
earth cannot make high into low,
humanity cannot make male into female,
rewards cannot encourage the unworthy—
gold and silk before them cannot make the aged carry them,
punishments cannot ensure the guilty—
axes and blades behind them cannot make the mute speak.*

Pangzi said:
*'How then does one achieve success?'*

Lüguanzi said:
*'Heaven cannot command humanity,
humanity cannot command heaven.
Follow the nature of things,
and success or ruin lies within.
This is the second principle—
it lies in *authority* and *control*.

It lies in authority, so wealth may exceed abundance;
it lies in control, so warfare may exceed victory.
The generation of wealth
depends on strength upon the earth,
harmony with heaven;
victory in war
depends on harmony with the **Way**,
unity with humanity.

Those who do not know this
take disorder for harmony,
disaster for advantage.
Taking disorder for harmony,
their wealth becomes poverty;
taking disaster for advantage,
their armies are captured.

In the past, those who knew the times
harmonized with the **Way**,
or *clarified* it.
Those who did not know it
endangered their spirit and clarity.
When the **Way** is lost,
or *oppressed*,
and spirit and clarity are ruined—
what can stay the wound?
*Stay* means to halt its spread.

Thus it is said:
*'Oh **Way**, oh **Way**—
preserve spirit and clarity together.'*

Pangzi said:
*'How does one preserve them together?'*

Lüguanzi said:
*The virtuous generate the sage,
the virtuous above generate the sage.
The sage generates the **Way**,
the **Way** generates law,
law generates spirit,
one yin and one yang—this is the **Way**.
To regulate and apply it is called *law*.
Its beneficial use in entering and exiting,
all people employing it—this is *spirit*.
Spirit generates clarity.
Spirit below generates clarity.
Spirit and clarity—
this is the end of *rectification*.
Partiality generates unity,
publicness generates clarity,
sincerity and trust generate spirit.
Thus it is said: *This is the end of rectification.*
The end may have no end—
thus, they preserve each other.*

---
**Chapter Fifteen: On Learning**

Pangzi asked Lüguanzi:
*"When the sage studies under a teacher,
does he have a beginning and end?
Or does he merely collect and recite,
closing the coffin and stopping there?"*

Lüguanzi said:
*"The beginning is in the first question,
the end is in the Nine **Paths**.
If one does not hear the resolution of the Nine **Paths**,
merely collecting and reciting,
closing the coffin and stopping—
how can one be certain?

This is not just about white and black confusion—
even when the coffin is closed and study ends,
it is still insufficient to determine truth.

Thus, what is precious in studying
is not merely reciting words—
it lies in grasping the body of the text,
understanding the meaning of speech."*

Pangzi said:
*"What are the Nine **Paths**?"*

Lüguanzi said:
*"First, **Dao** and virtue;
second, yin and yang;
third, laws and orders;
fourth, celestial officials;
fifth, divine omens;
sixth, arts and skills;
seventh, human nature;
eighth, tools and instruments;
ninth, military strategy."*

Pangzi said:
*"I wish to hear of the Nine **Paths**."*

Lüguanzi said:
*"**Dao** and virtue are the conduct and principles by which one cultivates a foundation—
the foundation as clear as the offering of unblemished silk.
**Dao** and virtue are the root of conduct,
thus they are called the foundation.

Yin and yang are the divisions and harmonies
by which one observes the changes of **qi**.
The *Zhou Officials* states: ‘The Preserver of Chapters [observes] by stars and soil,
by clouds and phenomena,
by the twelve years and twelve winds,
to foretell the calamities and auspices of Heaven and Earth.’
Laws and orders are the means by which one governs **Dao**, restraining chaos and maintaining order—
the lifeblood of the state.
Celestial officials are the signs and portents of ritual propriety,
the responses of the people below.
This is the order of learning.

When **Dao** and virtue are made clear, then yin and yang follow,
and when yin and yang are made clear, then laws and orders follow;
once these three are complete,
only then can one speak of governance.

Celestial officials refer to the Grand Steward [冢宰].
All officials derive their measures from him,
thus they are called ‘signs of ritual propriety.’
He initiates the beginning,
thus they are called ‘auspicious portents.’
For he governs with stillness while others respond with action,
thus they are called ‘the people’s response.’

Divine omens are the majestic presence and radiant aura
by which one categorizes the extraordinary.
As the *Rites of Sacrifice* says:
‘When their **qi** ascends and shines above,
it becomes the manifest brilliance of *Zhaomíng* [昭明],
the sorrowful lament of *Zhúhāo* [煮蒿],
a chilling desolation.’
This is the essence of all things,
the manifestation of the divine.

Arts and skills are like the *Shèngtóng Rèn* [胜同任]—
some dwell in harmony, others in distinction.
They reveal what is singular and unique without repetition.
The *Zhou Officials* states:
‘The Six Virtues distinguish by wisdom, benevolence, sagacity, righteousness, loyalty, and harmony,
while the Six Arts harmonize by ritual, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics.’

Human nature is the vast array of small and great,
foolish and wise,
virtuous and unworthy,
heroic and brilliant—
all the myriad dispositions of the people.

Tools and instruments are aids for travel—
some serve as carriages, others as steeds.
They are the implements the world uses and the state must possess.

Military strategy is the grasp of power and authority,
the establishment of an unassailable position—
or the seizing of advantageous ground.
The Nine **Paths** embody the mind,
and when embodied, they are said to have spirit.
*Form* [形] is the visible manifestation.
Later, one can perceive changes and name them,
for when things arrive, one can name them.

Some say: ‘The strange and the unusual are called changes.’
The *Liezi* states:
‘Great Yu acted upon them and saw them,
while Bo Yi understood them and named them.’
This is of the same kind.
One follows what they do to determine them."*

「If the heart lacks *form* [形] and spirit, it may be called *emptiness* [虚].
Words may have a *transmission* [传] character, though they are *lofted and bound* [抟捆],
binding, akin to knocking with a mallet—
yet one does not know where they lead.

That heart is the sovereign—
when it *reaches* [至], it commands the inner to govern the outer.
Within, there is no *subtlety* [巧] or *verification* [验]:
its essence is insufficient to *measure* the Dao/Way [揆道],
its coarseness is insufficient to *verify* things [验物].
Close, it does not suffice; far, it does not arrive.

**Pangzi** said: *“There are those who have heard of ‘once’* [曾闻].
*Rite* [礼], *music* [乐], *benevolence* [仁], *rightness* [义], *loyalty* [忠], *trustworthiness* [信]—
I wish to hear how these harmonize with *numbers* [数].”*

**Lǔ Guānzi** said:
*“What is called *rite* [礼] is that which does not transgress.
What is called *music* [乐] is that which causes no *harm* [菑] (or *weeds* [蔷]).
What is called *benevolence* [仁] is that which unites in shared good.
What is called *rightness* [义] is that which unites in shared evil.
What is called *loyalty* [忠] is that which, though long healed, remains close.
What is called *trustworthiness* [信] is that which does not produce *dual echoes* [二响].”

The Sage employs these six principles—
though they may seem *unsubstantial* [无者],
they are the *divinatory patterns* [卦] (akin to *divination* [卜])
that govern the world’s gains and losses, obedience and rebellion.

To stray from the Dao/Way [道] is not *numbers* [数];
one cannot thus *unravel the threads of fate* [□□绪端].
To disregard the *original principles* [元法],
one cannot grasp the *heart’s essence* [心体].
The *sacrificial knife* [刽] (akin to *carving* [郀])
*—the* *Nán Huá* [《南华》] says—
“discards its limbs, exiles its wisdom.
It also says:
‘The Dao/Way [道] encompasses and sustains heaven and earth;
the gentleman cannot fail to *carve* [刳] his heart to align with it.’

Though *superficial* [浅] yet *unexhausted* [不穷],
though *vast* [博] yet *hollow* [虚]—
Pangzi bowed twice and said:
*“There is a question of admonition here.
Though not such as this, if one lacks *material* [材] yet remains *vigorous* [健],
who can *learn* [学]? What can *become* [能]?
This is the Dao/Way [道] of the world,
yet rulers abandon it—why?’”*

**Lǔ Guānzi** said:
*“To be *unworthy* [贱] arises from being *unused* [弗器];
*instruments* [器] are thus *elevated* [提].
To be *lowly* [贱] arises from having *no purpose* [无所用].
A lost boat in the mid-river [中河失船]#24,
a gourd [壶] worth a thousand gold pieces.
The gourd, *bottle gourd* [瓠], worn as an ornament,
can ferry one across.
Southerners call it a *waist-boat* [腰舟].
Nobility and lowliness are not fixed;
time dictates their nature.

To *know* [知] the good as good,
the bright and the obscure are unchanging,
one *measurement* [揆] suffices until today.
To *not know* [不知] the good as good,
thus there are *death of the body* [身死] and *ruin of the state* [国亡],
*extinction of sacrifices* [绝祀] and *obliteration of lineage* [灭宗].
Even the *common folk* [细人] struggle to preserve life,
how much more so for the *ruler* [义]?
This is said of the common folk,
yet how much more applies to the ruler himself?
Its meaning should be *self-reflected* [自况].”

**Chapter Sixteen of the World’s Worthies [世贤]**
**Zhuō Xiāng Wáng** (should be *Dào* [悼]) asked **Páng Nuǎn**:
*“Does the ruler of men also act for his state?”*
(Zhuō should be *Dào*—this is **Zhào Dào Xiāng Wáng** [赵悼襄王].)
When **Zhào Xiào Chéng Wáng** [赵孝成王] passed away,
his son **Yǎn** [偃] ascended the throne,
thus becoming the **Dào Xiāng Wáng** [悼襄王].
In the third year of his reign,
**Páng Nuǎn** prepared to attack **Yàn** [燕],
capturing its general **Jù Xīn** [剧辛].

**Páng Nuǎn** said:
*“Does the King not hear of **Yú Tū** [俞跗] as a physician?
Once the disease is formed, it must be treated;
even spirits and gods avoid it.
The **Chǔ Wáng** [楚王] sat upon the throne,
yet because of the **Suí** [随] soldiers,
he waited until night when the illness [□] was upon his body,
and then he *must* have **Yú Tū** [俞跗].
**Yú Tū**, it seems, was not a **Chǔ** [楚] man—
this is also an allegory.

The *transmission* [传] says:
‘In the upper antiquity,
there was a physician named **Yú Tū** [俞跗],
who treated diseases not with decoctions, *medicated wine* [体酒],
*appetizing stones* [馋石], *muscle-twisting* [蹻引],
*pressing peaches* [案桃], or *poisonous moxibustion* [毒熨],
but by cutting skin and severing flesh,
resolving muscle and tendon knots,
extracting marrow and brain,
cleansing the intestines and stomach,
refining the *essence* [精] and transforming the *form* [形].
Though already formed, the disease *must* be treated,
and even spirits and gods avoid it.’

**Dào Xiāng Wáng** [悼襄王] said:
*“Well said.”*

Páng Nuǎn said: *“Your Majesty, have you forgotten?*
In the past, **Yí Yǔ** [伊尹] was the physician of **Yīn** [殷],
**Tài Gōng** [太公] was the physician of **Zhōu Wǔ Wáng** [周武王],
**Bǎi Lǐ** [百里] was the physician of **Qín** [秦],
**Shēn Jū** [申麃] was the physician of **Yǐng** [郢]—
**Yǐng**, the capital of **Jīng** [荆].
**Yuán Jì** [原季] was the physician of **Jìn** [晋];
the *Guó Yǔ* [《国语》] says:
‘**Jìn Wén Gōng** [晋文公] appointed **Yuán Jì** as his minister.’

**Fàn Lì** [范蠡] was the physician of **Yuè** [越],
**Guǎn Zhòng** [管仲] was the physician of **Qí** [齐],
and thus the five states became hegemon.
Their skill was the same,
yet their **Dào** [道] differed in method.

**Zhuó Xiāng Wáng** [卓襄王] said:
*“I wish to hear of these methods.”*

Páng Nuǎn replied:
*“Has Your Majesty not heard of **Wèi Wén Hóu** [魏文侯] questioning **Biàn Que** [扁鹊]?
**Biàn Que**, a man from **Bó Hǎi** [勃海] with the surname **Qín** [秦],
named **Yuè Rén** [越人], said:
‘My elder brother is the best physician,
my middle brother is second,
and I am the least skilled.’

**Wèi Wén Hóu** asked:
‘May I hear more?’

**Biàn Que** replied:
‘My eldest brother treats illness by observing the **shén** [神],
removing it before it takes form—
this is the **shén yī** [神医], acting before disease manifests.
The *Zhōu Guān* [《周官》] says:
‘The physician of illness examines the five **qì** [气],
the five **shēng** [声], and the five **sè** [色] to determine life and death,
cross-verifying with the nine **jiǎo** [窍] and the nine **zàng** [藏].
But one who is blind to the **shén**,
yet relies on the five **qì**, five **shēng**, and five **sè**,
and further cross-verifies with the nine **jiǎo** and nine **zàng**—
this is already crude.
Yet the *Zhōu Guān* speaks only of this,
for it is the method of the mediocre.
**Qí** [歧] and **Fù** [附]—could such masters truly exist in the world?
Thus their names do not leave their families;
their fame remains within their gates.’

My middle brother treats illness at the level of **háo máo** [毫毛],
this is the **míng yī** [明医], treating it before disorder spreads—
what is called *recognizing form and awakening*.
Thus his name does not leave the neighborhood;
his fame is known only to his neighbors.

As for me, **Biàn Que**,
I probe the blood vessels,
administer toxic medicines,
and treat between the muscles and skin—
thus my name is heard by the feudal lords.
My cures are crude,
and my fame spreads far.

**Wèi Wén Hóu** said: *“Well said.”*
He then asked:
‘If **Guǎn Zhòng** [管子] practiced medicine with **Biàn Que**’s methods,
could **Huán Gōng** [桓公] have achieved his hegemony?’

**Guǎn Zhòng** rescued **Huán Gōng**,
often acting subtly—
thus he could make his lord a hegemon.
**Huán Gōng** truly grew angry at **Shǎo Jī** [少姬],
and launched a southern raid on **Cài** [蔡].
**Guǎn Zhòng** then attacked **Chǔ** [楚],
accusing it of failing to pay tribute to the **Zhōu** court.
**Huán Gōng** truly led a northern campaign against the **Shān Róng** [山戎],
while **Guǎn Zhòng** used the opportunity to command **Yàn** [燕]
to restore the policies of **Chào Gōng** [召公].
At that time, no other feudal lord knew of this.
This was his treatment at the level of **háo máo**.

All these were cases of *not treating illness as illness*—
some say *not treating what is not yet illness*.
But when illness is already severe, is it not too late?
Severe illness is called *illness*.
To treat it without a name—
some say *to treat the nameless as if it were formless*—
once the form and name of the illness are manifest,
then the physician is summoned—
this is why **Huán Gōng** died.

As for the ultimate achievement—
some say *the six extremes*—
the efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion has no basis for pride,
so the ignorant call it *natural*.
Extending this to governance,
this is why the *strike-the-soil* people [common folk]
do not recognize the efforts of **Yáo** [尧] and **Shùn** [舜].

Thus, the skilled physician transforms [disease],
while the incompetent ruins [the patient].
Even if by chance they do not die,
their limbs are crippled and their sinews stretched.
*Sinews* refers to the **jiān lěi** [牵孪, tendons].

**Zhuó Xiāng Wáng** said: *“Well said.”*
*“Though I cannot avoid injury,
who could inflict more than a hair’s breadth upon me?
Perhaps **Guǎn Zhòng** will emerge from among my subjects.”*

---
**Tiān Quán** [天权] **Chapter Seventeen**
To *lift heaven and earth* and yet be unable—
*[This refers to those who]*
like the *Nán Huá* [《南华》] says, *“flanking the sun and moon,
embracing the cosmos”*—
this is the kind described here.
It is called *returning* [还]—
or *circulating* [绎].
Those who do not return to the **míng** [名] are called **Cháng Zhù** [常住],
dwelling eternally in the true **jì** [际] without being ensnared by **míng** [名].
Those who chase externals and lose themselves,
ever burdened by **zào huà** [造化],
how could they lift heaven and earth and wander freely?
Even if their **míng zhào** [明照] is bright as the moon,
their **guāng zhào** [光照] radiant as the sun,
they cannot illuminate their own **míng** [明].
**Lí Zhū** [离朱], even in broad daylight, could wipe his eyes
and see the hairs on a man’s face a hundred paces away,
yet he could not clearly see his own **jié** [睫].
Thus, those who chase externals and fail to return to their own **líng** [灵],
even with brilliance like the moon and radiance like the sun,
how could they illuminate their own **míng**?
To **dú huà** [独化] the beginning and end,
to **suí néng xù zhì** [随能序致],
*—**zhì** [致] may also be read as **gù** [故]—*
to stand alone in the cosmos without bounds,
this is called **Huáng Tiān Dì** [皇天地].
*Without bounds* means without territorial limits.
**Gé** [革] says:
*“Beyond the four seas, without end or limit,
it is still like **Qí Zhōu** [齐州].
Travel east to **Yíng** [营], and the people are the same;
ask about the east of **Yíng**, and it is still **Yíng**.
Travel west to **Yōu** [幽], and the people are the same;
ask about the west of **Yōu**, and it is still **Yōu**.”

Floating and suspended is the **míng** of heaven and earth,
the rotation of the four seasons,
the shifting of the sun and moon—
**yì** [埶] as if floating and suspended.
**Wěi mìng xiàng lí** [委命相鬲] is called **shí** [时].
**Qǐ rán wú jiàn** [且然无间] is called **mìng** [命].
The four seasons’ rotation is entrusted to **shí** [时].
Yet wood spreads, metal contracts, fire blazes, water chills—
like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth,
each has its function, yet they cannot communicate.
If they communicate and **lì** [鬲], this is called **Dào** [道].
Thus **Dào** has what is **sè** [塞] and what is **tōng** [通].
It connects all things,
leads heaven and earth—
heaven and earth below have **jiàn bào** [建报].
*—**Shè bèi** [搏] may also be read as **yǔ zhòu** [宇宙].*
**Tóng gēn** [同根], called **yǔ zhòu** [宇宙].
*Closing heaven* is called **yǔ** [宇],
*opening heaven* is called **zhòu** [宙].
The two rely on each other to stand,
thus they are called **hé shè tóng gēn** [合搏同根].
Knowing **yǔ** [宇], thus there is nothing it does not contain—
it has substance yet no fixed place—this is **yǔ** [宇].
Knowing **yǔ**, thus there is nothing it does not contain.
Knowing **zhòu** [宙], thus there is nothing it lacks—
it has duration yet no origin—this is **zhòu** [宙].
Knowing **zhòu**, thus there is nothing it lacks.”

「Knowing **virtue/power** [德], **virtue/power** may also be written as **yǐn** [隐].
Thus there is nothing it does not harmonize with—
knowing **virtue/power**, thus all it encounters upon the earth,
it does not choose yet finds rest.
Knowing the **Dao/Way** [道], thus there is nothing it does not obey—
knowing the **Dao/Way**, thus all it receives from heaven,
it does not decline yet listens to it.
Knowing **things** [物], thus there is nothing it does not conform to—
it follows their natural state, and thus all things cannot but conform to it.
Knowing **unity** [一] yet not knowing the **Dao/Way**, thus it has not yet been fully embraced—
it cannot perceive its own clarity, hence it is said not yet to have been fully embraced.
In the past, one who traveled without knowing where to go,
if they sought it, they would certainly be confused.
The lost sheep of old was said:
*"Within the fork, there is another fork—
I do not know where to go,
thus I return."*

**Dōu Zǐ** [都子] said:
*"The **Great Dao/Way** [大道] is lost through its many forks,
the scholar is lost through their many paths.
To seek what one does not know
and inquire of **symbols** [象] is certain not to find it.
**Symbols** are the **trap and snare** [筌蹄] of the mind.
If one seeks what they do not know
by examining the **trap and snare**,
yet does not seek it beyond **words and meanings** [言意],
how can they attain its essence?"*

The **wheelwright** [轮人] said:
*"What you study
are the dregs and refuse of the ancients.
After tracing the meaning of **Hùguān Zǐ** [鹖冠子],
it is to dispel ignorance and confusion,
to guide people toward **unity** [致一]
and seek the **Dao/Way** beyond **words and meanings**,
thus there is this saying.
Therefore, people are all obscured by what they cannot see,
**lì** [鬲] by what they cannot hear,
**sè** [塞] by what they cannot open,
**qū** [诎] by what they cannot overcome,
**zhì** [制] by what they cannot master.
The multitude of the world
is confined by these five,
yet does not comprehend them.

What has not yet been seen yet has form—
though perilous moments may not yet appear,
the principle is already present.
Thus it is said:
*'There are armies without soldiers,
there are mourning without garments'*—
this is the reason people lightly regard death and life,
this is the reason people lightly regard safety and danger.
Because of this, they know it.

The mosquito and fly fall into a thousand-**rèn** [仞] deep ravine—
a ravine is called **gǔ** [谷].
Then they begin to soar and attain their **container** [容]—
*container* may also be read as **guest** [客].
They attain the **soaring and gliding** [翱翔] of their **container**.
To soar high is called **terrified flight** [翱],
to spread wings and remain motionless is called **gliding** [翔].
Oxen and horses fall there,
and are shattered—
*shattered* may also be read as **bowl** [钵].
Yet they have no **container**.
From this observation,
it is clear that the great are not harmed,
while the heavy suffer deep wounds.
This speaks of the **stumbling of the exalted** [贵高之蹶],
whose misfortune is great.

The *Laozi* says:
*"How can the lord of ten-thousand chariots
lightly regard the world with his own body?"*

Warfare is to venture death for life,
to confront peril for safety.
Thus, **words** [言] are true,
and the **Dao/Way** is fitting—
*fitting* may also be read as **rich** [富].
The **Dao/Way** is fitting, or it may be read as **"the Dao/Way establishes richness"** [道奠富].
**Words** are true,
then the **Dao/Way** is fitting.
The **Dao/Way** is like **action** [行].
Thus, a single gnat biting the skin
keeps one from sleeping till dawn;
half a grain of husk entering the eye
leaves one unable to govern the four quarters.

What is called **obscured** [蔽],
does it necessarily mean to be blocked by curtains and screens,
or concealed by **fine** [□] and **coarse** [薄] fabrics?
To see **uniformity** [周平] yet not perceive it is called **obscured**.
In the past, a man of **Qí** [齐] desired gold—
at dawn, in the market,
he snatched another’s gold,
thinking that the time for taking gold
was when only gold was seen,
not people.
This shows how **greed** [嗜欲] can so disturb the mind.
Does it necessarily mean that one is blocked by objects on all sides?

Thus, when afflicted with poor vision,
the eyes do not see;
when afflicted with poor hearing,
the ears do not hear.
**Ignorance** [蒙]—
sometimes without the word *ignorance*—
thus one knows that they can exhaust all heard and seen.
*—end of sentence.*
**Lì** [鬲] may also be read as **gāo** [高].」

Thus, when one’s **foundations** [奠] are established, all actions and their **inherent powers** [任力] come to an end—
*—end of sentence.*
**Obstruction** [塞]—
the four directions [四发] are **unified** [上统] and **unified** [上统], sometimes read as **unified** [上纥], yet they do not **continue** [续], and **vague** [□□] things **fade away** [消亡].

The **Dao/Way** [道], when it comes,
must first have its **response** [应], and only then does it arrive—
*—end of sentence.*
**Response** [至], sometimes read as **harmonize** [合至].

It is **manifest** [易] in the *Book of Changes* [观之於易].

**Actions** [事], when they are **accomplished** [成],
must first have **virtue/power** [德], and only then can they be **fulfilled** [成].
**Virtue/power** [德]—
one knows what **actions** [事] can be **fulfilled** [成] and what **virtue/power** [德] can be **obtained** [得] from them,
and only then does one say, *"I can fulfill this"* [我能成之].

**Fulfillment without effort** [成无为],
is **fulfillment** [成] in **non-action** [无为].
**Obtaining without source** [得无来],
is **obtaining** [得] from **non-source** [无来].

When **virtue/power** [德] is **complete** [至],
then the **subtle** [妙] must be understood by the **heart** [心解],
and yet the **sovereign** [君] cannot **obtain** [得] it from his **subjects** [臣],
nor the **son** [子] can **offer** [献] it to his **father** [父],
then **obtaining** [得] it lies within oneself alone—
its **source** [来] is not from anywhere else, is it?

**Examine** [详详], sometimes read as **discern** [辟#29].

**Examine** [察] its **Dao/Way** [道],
how could it be like this?

**Lost** [迷] in the past, yet **observing** [往] the present,
this is why one knows that they have not yet **fulfilled** [能] it.

Those who **erect** [立] a **standard** [表] and **observe** [望] do not **err** [惑],
those who **follow** [按] the **method** [法] and **cut** [割] do not **doubt** [疑],
for it is said that there is something to **aspire to** [希].

**Observing** [望] without a **standard** [表],
**cutting** [割] without a **method** [法],
is this not the realm of **erroneous confusion** [惑]?

**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—
it is not because there is no **brightness** [明] of the sun and moon,
no **order** [序] of the four seasons,
no **movement** [行] of stars and constellations—
but because one **inverts** [反] these things and **confuses** [兹] them,
*—end of sentence.*
sometimes read as **erroneous confusion from the West** [西之惑].

**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—
it is simply **inversion** [反之].

Is it necessarily because there is **nothing** [无]?

The *Liezi* [《列子》] says:
*"The four directions of heaven and earth,
the interplay of water and fire,
the shifts of cold and heat—
there is nothing that does not **invert and disorder** [倒错] itself,
for it is of this kind."*

**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—
**excessive** [疾] **vision** [视] leads to **greater disorder** [愈乱],
**deepening** [惇] and **changing** [易] **directions** [方].

**Excessive vision** [疾视],
is what was previously called **illness of vision** [病视] in the four directions.

Thus the *Book of Documents* [《书》] says:
*"Like one with failing eyesight seeing an empty land adorned with flowers—
the land is **empty** [空] and **without adornment** [无华],
yet it is because of **false perception** [妄见] that they see it so."*

**Deepening** [惇], is like **steadfastness** [笃].

**Changing directions** [易方],
is what the *Southern Huā* [《南华》] calls *"the four directions of heaven and earth shifting positions"* [天地四方易位].

When **excessive vision** [疾视] reaches the point where
the four directions of heaven and earth **shift positions** [易位],
then this is the **depth** [笃] of their **illness** [病],
not merely the **dimness** [昏] of their **vision** [华].

**Military** [兵] has **charms** [符],
and the **Dao/Way** [道] has **verification** [验],
for it is only those who are not **lost** [迷] who can **perceive** [见] it.

「Be prepared by making ready in advance, and plan by determining early.
Otherwise, you will be **bewildered** [惑].

**Leverage terrain** [因地利] and **counter with the Five Phases** [制以五行]:
Left—**Wood** [木], Right—**Metal** [金],
Front—**Fire** [火], Rear—**Water** [水],
Center—**Earth** [土].
Deploy troops and array soldiers—
never deviate from what is fitting.

The Five **Methodologies** [度] are aligned:
Left—**Wood**, Right—**Metal**, Front—**Fire**, Rear—**Water**, Center—**Earth**—
this is what they are.

Do not act rashly without cause.

**Shake the Handle** [招摇] is above,
**Shake the Handle**, the tip of the Dipper’s [斗] **Pivot** [柄端], guiding the **Battle Array** [主指].
When the **Marshal** [缮] **replenishes** [作] below,
*The Rites* [《礼》] say:
*"March forward with the Vermilion Bird [朱雀], then follow with the Dark Tortoise [玄武],
Left with the Azure Dragon [青龙], Right with the White Tiger [白虎],
**Shake the Handle** [招摇] above—
**replenish** [缮] their **fury** [怒], lest it grow fierce."*

This is what they mean.
**Replenish** [缮], is like **sustaining** [继].
For when **military momentum** [兵] is first **stirred** [一鼓作气],
it falters on the second **strike** [再而衰],
and **exhausts** [竭] on the third.
Thus, skilled warriors always **sustain their fury** [缮其怒],
so that the second **strike** [再] never **falter** [至於衰],
and the third **strike** [三] never **exhaust** [至於竭].
This is how the Yellow Emperor [黄帝] achieved
a hundred battles without defeat.

**Model oneself after Heaven** [取法於天].
The Four Seasons **embody** [求] or **yield** [作] **omens** [象] for **life and growth** [生象]:
Spring—**Azure Dragon** [苍龙],
Summer—**Red Bird** [赤鸟],
Autumn—**White Tiger** [白虎],
Winter—**Dark Tortoise** [玄武].
When Heaven and Earth are **mastered** [得],
what cannot be **subdued** [宰]?

That which **logic inhabits** [理] is called **terrain** [地],
That which **spirit manifests** [神] is called **Heaven** [天].
Knowing Heaven, one can **achieve unity in action** [一举] and **fourfold success** [四致],
**rise together** [并起] yet **stand alone in victory** [独或作税成].

**Crows follow** [乌乘随随], **□□ hover** [□蜚垂□] **□□** [秋].
*(Unclear—original text has missing or ambiguous characters.)*

Thus, those who were once **adept at strategy** [善计者],
did not **pursue profit** [求利],
*(or: **pursue victory** [求胜].)*
but **illuminated the numbers** [明数];
*(or: **illuminated victory** [明胜].)*
Those who were once **adept at war** [善战者],
did not **pursue victory** [求胜],
but **illuminated victory** [明胜].
Do they not see the **recluse** [隐者]?

If one **begins to know** [设始知之],
those who **know** [知之者] have **already bent** [屈]—
they **know** [已知之].
If those who do not **know** [弗知者],
even if a **teacher** [师] **explains** [说],
they still **do not grasp** [不晓].
The **recluse** [隐者] **conceals and withdraws** [韬潜],
so their **difficulty in knowing** [难知] is thus.
This is why skilled warriors **must** [必] **illuminate victory** [至於明胜].

Alas,
those who **obscure omens** [蔽象] and **block the two passes** [两塞之人],
**collapse before defeat** [未败而崩],
**are captured before death** [未死而禽].
To **take a state by force** [设兵取国] is the **glory of martial prowess** [武之美];
To **take a state without force** [不动取国] is the **refinement of civil skill** [文之华].
**Soldiers grow stronger in battle** [士益武],
**People grow more refined in peace** [人不益文].
*(These two lines essentially convey the same idea, though phrased differently.)*

**Transforming refinement** [变文],
this is how **differences arise** [是以不同].
The two are **truly** [甚] **sparingly loved** [寡爱].
*(or: **truly** [甚] **lacking in compassion** [少恩].)*
**Martial affairs are harsh and cruel** [武事刻惨],
**losing in mercy** [失之少恩].
**It is beyond measure to discuss** [不可胜论].»

The ear can hear and regulate sounds, yet cannot itself produce them.
The eye can perceive varied forms, yet cannot itself create them.
The mouth can speak of the divine and luminous, yet cannot itself embody them.

All this serves to illustrate that masters and artisans can teach others the rules and measures, yet cannot themselves impart their skill.

Thus, the sages of old who followed the Dao of the martial arts would call out to those who had strayed, *"Do not go!"*—forbidding them from proceeding.
They would open the veiled: as *Zhuangzi* says,
*"Had not the Master uncovered my shroud,
I would not have seen the vast completeness of heaven and earth."*

They would loosen bonds and remove thorns—
*bonds* as in the cords that bind,
*thorns* as in the piercing of needles—
revealing confusion and clarifying understanding.

Thus, they could halt perilous schemes,
*halt* meaning to cease and restrain.
They would traverse customs and exceed conventions,
surpassing norms and ranks,
their strategic insight leaving common folk far behind—
some read *"or"* as *"unbroken lineage"*—
those who could meet challenges ahead would confront them,
those who could discern challenges behind would reveal them.
*Reveal* as in *"to make manifest past and present."*

They would grasp the essence of all under heaven without oversight,
*oversight* meaning *"loss."*
Thus, they would illuminate the strategies of enemy states,
ensuring they were not controlled by enemies.

The ways of victory in battle and conquest,
responding to all things without exhaustion,
governing ten thousand with one yet not consolidating all—
they would grasp the essentials alone,
as if summarizing each matter thoroughly,
drawing strength and providing for all.

From this, distinctions arise,
their brilliance manifest in their renown—
the court is where renown is displayed.
The *Commentaries* say:
*"Those who contend for honor do so in the court,
those who contend for profit do so in the market."*

They would exhaust the variations of virtue,
reaching the fundamental essence of axes and shields—
*axes* as in the *"xiao"* of *"xiao xiao"* (the sound of chopping),
*shields* as in *"dry"* (the protective cover).
The axe is used to strike others,
the shield to defend oneself.
To know this is to know warfare.

The character *steel* (戎) is composed of *halberd* (戈) and *armor* (甲),
for the Dao of warfare is thus alone.

This is called the transmission of the boundless—
exhausting variations and reaching the fundamental essence,
thus attaining the convergence of adaptable transformation.

The *Nanhua* [Southern Flower, i.e., *Zhuangzi*] says:

*"Now if one were to attempt to traverse Zhou in Ru [i.e., by land],
it would be like pushing a boat across dry land—
laborious yet yielding no result.
They do not know the transmission of the boundless,
the art of responding to things without exhaustion.
They are confined within the uncircumscribed realm.
[Or: *the boundless expanse*.]
Those who govern affairs internally cannot fathom their form,
[Or: *the character ‘wu’ (無) as ‘nonexistent’*].
Those who wield arms externally cannot fulfill their purpose.
If one fails within, how can one succeed without?

For warfare has three aspects:
Heaven, humanity, and Earth.
Heaven’s timing, Earth’s advantage, humanity’s harmony.
Warfare exhausts humanity—
when warfare’s purpose is fulfilled, the Way of humanity is attained.

Humanity exhausts Earth,
Earth exhausts Heaven.
When humanity is exhausted, Earth is revealed.
When Earth is exhausted, Heaven is revealed.
Heaven has its victories—
victory comes from Heaven’s timing.
Earth has its supports—
support comes from Earth’s advantage.
Humanity has its accomplishments—
accomplishment comes from humanity’s harmony.
Thus, the adept in warfare must be cautious,
for what they must guard against is battle.
They conquer with Heaven, sustain with Earth, and perfect with humanity.
When these three are clear,
what strategy cannot be realized?

What is meant by ‘Heaven’?
Not that it verifies victory through tangible means—
Heaven’s work is profound and mysterious,
requiring no material substance,
yet it cannot be overcome.
Is it not the force by which the sun’s momentum
dominates all things in their submission?
This is called *shì* [势].
It encompasses the Five Phases’ cycles of flourishing, decline, isolation, and void.
Heaven generates beings yet does not possess them—
its origin lies in yin and yang.
The Four Seasons grow, flourish, recede, and store without losing order:
As the *Nanhua* says:
‘Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter follow—
the divine sequence.’
Its *quan* [权] is its resonance.
When it strikes *jiao* [角] or manifests in *shang* [商],
[and so on].
Sound resides in what cannot be transmitted—
its power is supreme.
Its power is not mere dross,
hence it cannot be transmitted.

Thus, those who study warfare
must first master Heaven’s *quan*,
deploy the Five Phases,
and wage battle with the Five Tones.
To the left, double *gong* [宫] and *jiao* [角],
to the right, embrace *shang* [商] and *yu* [羽].
[Sentence incomplete.]"*

Thus, the **征** [Zheng] comes after.

With the **□** [or *zhuǎn*], one can summon the countless multitudes without relying on preexisting foundations.
**□** [or *zhuǎn*]—like a gathering.

Han Xin said:
*"I am not one who, like the common soldiers and officers, drives market folk to battle.
His strategy is not to place them in a position where they must fight to the death—
rather, they fight for themselves, and yet I can still use them.
This is what he understands.*

The **陆** [or *bì*], **溺** [or *nì*], **溺人** [or *nìrén*—*to drown people*], **陆溺** [or *lùnì*—*to sink and drown*].
Indeed, he employs unconventional tactics in warfare,
and his hidden schemes can stir up chaos like winds over barren earth.
Thus, he can move freely through **窦** [or *dòu*—*passages, gaps*], **决** [or *jué*—*breaks, breaches*].
If one cannot summon chaos through **风波** [or *fēngbō*—*winds and waves*],
then even if they flow like rivers,
one can make them run dry.
The *Xunzi* says:
‘Block their source, open their gaps—
the rivers and lakes can be drained.’

If it stands alone without connection,
if it relies solely on **金** [Metal] **德** [virtue/power],
exalted in slaughter and punishment,
and does not bind the Four Phases together to support it,
then its flaws are as described below.

To sever the **道** [Way]’s **纪** [or *jì*—*order, regulation*],
to disrupt the **天** [Heaven]’s **文** [or *wén*—*patterns, harmony*],
to violate **音** [or *dà*—*to reach, extend*] **物** [things]’s **情** [or *qíng*—*nature, disposition*].
Heaven’s lack of **纲** [or *xì*—*governing principles, guidance*],
its **细** [or *mì*—*delicacy, subtlety*]—
its punishment is **燥** [or *cǎn*—*harsh, cruel*] **凶** [or *xiōng*—*disaster, calamity*].
Harsh disaster—disastrous drought.
The harmony of the Four Seasons is not fulfilled,
so its **答** [or *dá*—*recompense, consequence*] is disastrous drought.
The *Laozi* says:
‘There will surely be years of calamity.’
This is precisely what he means.

To avoid disorder and rebellion,
one must carefully govern **天英** [Heaven’s virtue/power];"

To sever Heaven’s **英** [virtue/power]—or omit the two characters, Heaven’s virtue/power is lost—
the Three Armies lack substance.

If it lacks virtue/power yet has substance, who could possess such things?
This is false speech.

There are indeed things that bear virtue/power without substance,
but none that lack virtue/power yet have substance.

The **常圣** [Eternal Sage] of vast wisdom—
(□□ possibly refers to *博* [comprehensive] *□* [□] *□* [□])
—who restores the unity of past and present in a single day,
opens and closes in accordance with Heaven and Earth’s demands.

(Or: *This refers to the Sage’s eyes and ears—*
*Heaven and Earth’s dependents—*
*who open and close together.*)

If the True Sage reaches **纯** [perfection] in three ten-thousands of years,
then Heaven and Earth merge with me as one.

The Five **行** [Phases] cannot govern,
the Five **音** [Notes] cannot regulate,
though I abandon **阴阳** [Yin and Yang],
it is still possible.

If I were not in this realm,
could I then discard the techniques of Yin and Yang?
Thus, the following text states:

Thus, the *Tianquan Shenqu Wuyin Shubing Yiyan* [Heaven’s Authority, Divine Harmony, Five-Note Military Arts, and Miscellaneous Sayings]
(likely the title of a military treatise) says:

Its chapters are structured by **祸福** [calamity and blessing].
(Above *祸福* possibly has the character *斯* [this].)
If it aligns with the **符节** [divine patterns and rhythms].

All undertakings arise from **虑** [consideration],
are completed through **务** [diligence],
and fail due to **惊** [recklessness].

*Neng Tian* [Mastering Heaven], Chapter Eighteen—
the **原圣心** [primordial Sage’s intent] in action.

The sentence is hidden and subtle before it may arise—
*"Sentiment"* (情), like the sentiment of Heaven and Earth.
The Sage exhausts all the sentiments of the world,
then responds to things.

Dispersed without bounds, yet seeking, it becomes eternal oversight—
The Way is *Zhongyong* [the Doctrine of the Mean], hence it seeks oversight.
Exceeding the profound and obscure, it then becomes nothing—
*"Exceed"* (轶), like exceeding ranks.
The Sage transcends all the principles of the world,
then forgets things.

Confronting the serene depths, he thinks with solemn caution—
The Way is *Zhongyong*, hence he thinks with solemn caution.

Severing the six extremes without constraint—
Sentiment is vast and subtle, yet it seeks oversight;
Exceeding the profound and obscure, he thinks with solemn caution—
This is how the Way is great yet unerratic, small yet unconfined.
Thus, he can sever the six extremes without constraint.
The six extremes are the six directions.
*"Constraint"* (绞) is a term for urgency.
Severing with this as the boundary—
Beyond the six directions, the Sage exists yet does not deliberate;
Within the six directions, the Sage deliberates yet does not argue.

Observing the boundless—
*"Naomo"* (孰莫), like *"what then?"*
Listening to the unerring,
Extending to the unconstrained,
Discussing the abyssal darkness,
Deeply tranquil, unperturbed by chaos—
Thus, he can cut off the dust and stand in *Taqing* [Supreme Clarity].

Going forward with none accompanying,
Alone he goes.

「Coming without company,
Alone he comes.

Sparse in preparation, few in his retinue—
He feeds at the fields of *Gujian* [Modest Sufficiency], hence it is called *Hibei*.
He wanders in the lands of *Jimo* [Silent Solitude], hence it is called *Guashu*.

Solitary yet unpaired,
He never sets up an opposing counterpart.
Thus, he remains without blemish.
When the *Zao Xue* [Purifying Waves] reach their peak—
*"Bao"* (彼), like *"that"* or *"there"*—
*"Bao"* (保), meaning *"secure"* or *"stable"*—
*This is what is meant by "arriving without movement."*

Transmitting what has not yet been,
He perceives it before its sprouting.
Guiding the leaderless in sequence,
He harmonizes yet does not lead#37.
Measuring the *Shiqi* [Ten Directions]#38,
He employs *Shi* [affairs]—
Or, *"Measuring the comings and goings, he regulates their rise and fall"*—
Those who have gone are diminished,
Those who are yet to come are ascendant.

Following the interplay of *dòng* [movement] and *jìng* [stillness],
He binds *shēng* [life]—
*"Sheng"* (笙), like *"harmony"* or *"resonance"*—
*"Jie"* (结), meaning *"to fulfill"* or *"to complete"*—
*"Hua"* (华), meaning *"to flourish"* or *"to manifest"*—
He can act in accordance with Heaven and Earth.

*Heaven and Earth* (天地), are the *form* (形) of *naturalness* (自然),
Which cannot be altered.
*Odd and even* (奇耦), are the *numbers* (数) of *Dao* (道),
Which cannot be increased or decreased.
*Success and failure* (成败), are the *omens* (兆) of *virtue* (德),
*"Er"* (而), meaning *"you"*—
*"Chang"* (长), as in *"long-lasting"* or *"permanent"*—
Thus, when one attains the Dao to stand firm,
Earth can establish him;
When one attains the Dao to fall or topple#39,
Earth cannot establish him.
When one attains the Dao to rest securely,
Earth can secure him;
When one attains the Dao to be in peril,
Earth cannot secure him.
When one attains the Dao to flourish in life,
Heaven can nurture him;
When one attains the Dao to meet death,
Heaven cannot nurture him.
When one attains the Dao to persist,
Heaven can preserve him;
When one attains the Dao to perish,
Heaven cannot preserve him.
*That which is secure or perilous*—
*"Bao"* (彼), *"an"* (危), like *"these"*—
How can one blame Heaven’s Dao or the spirits and gods?
Straightforward, he pushes it forward;
Curved, he follows it naturally.
Self-secured, self-perilous, self-persisting, self-perishing—
Heaven’s Dao, how could it favor one over another,
And what role do the spirits and gods play in this?

*One* (一), or *"sun"* (日)—
The *virtue* (德) of the *worthy* (贤).
Not yet departed from *numbers* (数).
The *Sage* (圣), the *love* (爱) of the *worthy*,
*"Ai"* (爱), like *"reverence"* or *"admire"*—
The *Dao* (道), that which the *Sage* (圣) *rèn* [undertakes]#40,
*"Shì"* (史), like *"to govern"* or *"to direct"*—
The *attainment* (至) of the *perfect* (至).
Not departing from *truth* (真), he is called the *perfect* (至人).
Thus, the *Dao* is that which the *Sage* undertakes,
And the *perfect* attains—
With *perfection* (至) or *sainthood* (圣),
It cannot be borne by the world,
Cannot be named by reputation,
Cannot be conveyed by words,
Cannot be established by appearance—
Like the *symbols* (象) of the Dao, which are as the *doorways* (门户) of the Way.

*Dao* (道), like *"speech"* or *"expression"*—
The worthy and unworthy, the foolish and the wise,
Enter and exit through it yet remain unchanged.
The *Dao* is the *opener* (开) of things,
Able to make them *follow* (由) of their own accord.
It is not the *equalizer* (齐) of things,
Unable to *order* (序) them.
Thus, the *Sage* is the *Dao*,
Yet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.
The *Sage*, as the *master* (主) of the Dao,
Thus, the *Sage* is the *Dao*,
Yet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.

The *Dao* is the *unifier* (通) of things,
The *Sage* is the *sequencer* (序) of things—
Hence, there are the *Dao* of the ancient kings,
Yet no *ancient kings* of the *Dao*.
This further explains the distinction:
The *Sage* is the *Dao*,
Yet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.

The *Sage* is not as powerful as Heaven and Earth,
Yet knows their *rèn* [burden/role]#41;
His *qi* is not as vast as *yin-yang* [dark-light]#42,
Yet can serve as their *jīng* [canon/regulation]#43.
Not as numerous as all things,
Yet can act as their *zhèng* [standard/rectifier]#44.
Not as splendid as all beauties,
Yet can point out virtues and faults.
Not as rich in *virtue* (道德),
Yet can elevate them.
The *Yijing* says: *"Elevated and noble, none are greater than wealth and honor."*
*"Gao"* (高), meaning *"noble"*—
*"Chong"* (崇), meaning *"wealth"*—
Not as radiant as the *Shenming* [Divine Illumination]#45,
Yet can act as their *ruler* (主) or *king* (王)#46.
Not as subtle as the spirits and gods,
Yet can embody their *ling* [refined essence]#47.
Not as enduring as metal and stone,
Yet can temper their *jìng* [rigor/strength]#48.
Not as refined as the square and round,
Yet can manifest their *treatment* (治) or *vitality* (活)#49.

Of old, those who attained the Dao to stand firm,
Remain unshaken to this day—
The *four seasons* (四时), *Taishan* [Great Mountain]#50 is such;
Those who attained the Dao to be in peril,
Remain unsecured to this day—
The *Ling* [willow]#51, *Lingluán* [Willow Ravine]#52 or *Zhēnxī* [True Stream]#53—
*"Ling"* (苓), like *"to scatter"* or *"to fall"*—
*"Yin"* (堙), meaning *"to block"* or *"to obstruct"*—
The *shuìmù* [slender wood]#54 brings down the wind;
This is such—
」

Those who attained the Dao to thrive,
Remain undying to this day—
The sun and moon, the stars and constellations, are such;
Those who attained the Dao to perish,
Remain unpreserved to this day—
The willow leaves when frost strikes,
The morning dew when exposed to the sun—such is their fate.

Thus, the Sage takes from *wù* [the concrete/manifest]#55,
Yet does not seek in *chá* [the scattered/insubstantial]#56.
*Wù* is that which is concentrated within oneself;
*Chá* is that which disperses into things.

Things among things—
Fragrant and scattered, chaotic in appearance—
Who does not arise from One,
All arising from One.

To reach the One is easy?
To reach the One is indeed easy.

Thus, one establishes certainty in humanity,
Observes transformations in things.

The mouth is that by which one expresses sincere intent,
Yet some cannot *yú* [affirm/receive]#57 or *ài jiù* [love and comprehend]#58.
*"Yú"* means "to affirm and accept."
To proclaim what one says,
Yet sometimes exceeds the truth.

Thus, those whose actions differ criticize each other,
Those whose Dao differs oppose each other.

*Guǎncí* [deceptive speech]#59 is that which transforms things—
*Guǎncí*, like the followers of *Gàozǐ* [Gaozi]#60.
Gaozi rejected inherent meaning; the Sage does not possess this,
Thus it is called "transforming things."

The Sage knows what it departs from.

*Yíncí* [excessive speech]#61 is that which follows things—
*Yíncí*, like the followers of *Mòzǐ* [Mozi]#62.
Mozi practiced universal love; the Sage possesses this,
Thus it is called "following things."

The Sage knows what it aligns with.

*Zhàcí* [deceitful speech]#63 is that which obstructs things—
*Zhà*, akin to "evil."
The Sage knows what it adorns.

And further, it composes speech for it.

The *túncí* [reclusive speech]#64 is that which requests things—
The *Yí* [Rites of Zhou]#65 says: *"It is called 'commanded.'"*
The Sage knows its ultimate reach.
*Jí* [extreme], akin to *"exhaustion."*

The *zhèngcí* [proper speech]#66 is that which benefits things—
Neither deceptive, excessive, nor deceitful, nor reclusive—
This is called *zhèngcí* [proper speech].
The Sage knows its foundation.

*Lì* [foundation] is that which can be demonstrated or known in its reach,
Yet none can articulate what lies beyond.
Subtle and profound, the mind cannot grasp it.
How much less can speech?

Illuminating discourse distinguishes inner and outer,
Later generations can thus determine truth.
Surface and depth must both be understood,
Only then can verification be achieved.

One exists yet is unseen,
The Dao exists yet cannot be monopolized.

A fitting analogy is the abyss—
Its depths are unfathomable,
Endless waves surge yet never cease.
Encompassing and flowing, none can exhaust it.

Even the Sage, refining spirit and senses,
Polishing body and form,
Adjusting movements to harmony—
Small and great, curves and measures—
Nothing is overlooked, near or far, crooked or straight.

Thus, one who benefits ten thousand is called *jùn* [exalted],
One who benefits a thousand is called *háo* [heroic],
One who benefits a hundred is called *yīng* [exceptional].

Hence, the Sage’s speech is *fán* [ordinary].
*Fán* [ordinary]—the comprehensive and essential words.

**武灵王第十九**
武灵王问庞暖曰：
*"Wu Ling"*—the King of Zhao—asked *Páng Huàn* [Pang Wan]:
*"I have heard flying words say: 'A hundred battles won is not the highest excellence; victory without battle is the highest excellence. I wish to hear its explanation.'"*

Páng Huàn replied:
*"The skilled value not contending."*

*"Skilled"*—akin to *"excellence."*
Thus, the highest strategy uses *calculations and schemes*,
The next relies on *human affairs*,
The lowest resorts to *war and conquest*.

Those who use *calculations and schemes* confuse enemy rulers,
Causing them to abandon proper customs,
To be swayed by licentious trends,
To act without the Sage’s principles—
Granting rewards without merit,
Bestowing honors without labor,
Pardoning crimes in favor,
Executing the innocent in anger,
Claiming caution while oppressing the people,
Narrowing the populace while boasting of prosperity,
Multiplying useless rituals,
Obsessing over divination,
Relying solely on fortune-telling.

[Unclear text]—those who do not align with inner harmony.

What is meant by *relying on human affairs* is:
Using wealth and gifts,
Silencing close advisors,
Bribing ministers to obey,
Turning their *"yes"* to *"no"* and *"no"* to *"yes,"*
Severing the ruler’s connection to loyal ministers.

What is meant by *war and conquest* is:
When a state is already broken,
Army follows to attack—
As *Gōu Jiàn* used this, *Wú* perished,
*Chǔ* used this, *Chén* and *Cài* were subdued.
In the eighth year of *Líng Wáng*’s reign,
*Qì Chì* was annihilated.
In the tenth year,
*Qì Chì* was pacified.
Thus, *Chén* and *Cài* were conquered.
The *Sān Jiā* [Three Families] used this—*Zhì* was destroyed.
The *Sān Jiā*—*Jìn*, *Hán*, and *Wèi*—
*Hán* used this to split eastward.
In the twelfth year of *Jìn Hèng Gōng*,
*Hán Xuān Zǐ* divided *Qí Shì* and *Shàn Shè* with *Zhào* and *Wèi*.
*"Eastward split"*—is this correct?

Now, those who speak of war say:
The strong must prevail, the weak must perish.
Thus, small states have no kings,
And great lords never fall.

In the past, *Xià* was vast while *Tāng* was narrow,
*Yīn* was great while *Zhōu* was small,
*Yuè* was weak while *Wú* was strong—
This is called *"victory without battle,"*
The highest excellence.

This is the law of the *Yīn Jīng* [Dark Classic],
*The Yīn Jīng*—a text of *Huángdì* [Yellow Emperor].

The Way of nighttime warfare is akin to the *Tian Wǔ* [Heavenly Martial].

Now, some may see a hundred thousand corpses lying in wait,
Blood flowing a thousand *lǐ* [miles], yet victory still undecided.
If judged by military gains alone,
Such results are never as favorable.

Thus, the sage reflects with clarity and discernment,
And sometimes gains *virtue/power* [德] through this.
In quiet contemplation, he rejoices alone.
But those who merely hear the clamor of drums and cymbals,
And hope for martial prowess,
Who see the banners and flags,
And hope for battle formation,
Who grasp the weapons of war,
And hope for combat,
Who advance and retreat in the chaos of battle,
And hope for victory—
Such are the lords who meet their downfall.

*Wǔ Líng* sighed deeply and lamented:
"Life and death rest upon my own insignificance—
How slight a thing it is to nurture the roots of fortune!"

I have heard this, and now I measure my days and months with self-reflection.
In the past, those who conquered through *virtue/power* [德] did not deceive their mandate,
And those who seized the essentials spoke with precision.

*"Yīn Jīng"* [Dark Classic] continues:
The Way of nighttime warfare—
A text of the *Huángdì* [Yellow Emperor].
