**Preface to the *Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure***

The Dao cannot be transmitted through words, nor can it be recorded by name. Since ancient times, those who ascended as immortals and attained the Dao have been many.

I, in my aspiration, have long admired the sages of old and cherished the Great Dao in my heart. Yet, as the times turned to the chaos of war and the world fell into peril, I first sought refuge, wandering among rivers, lakes, and mountain valleys. In retreat, I came to know my nature and turned my mind toward purity, stillness, and the subtle.

Having perused the alchemical classics and repeatedly consulted with fellow Daoists, I found that they spoke only of minor arts for nourishing life, never of the great Dao of true immortality. Then, within the stone cliffs of Mount Zhongnan, I obtained the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* in thirty scrolls:
- The *Upper Section: Golden Proclamations*, composed by the Primordial Beginning;
- The *Middle Section: Jade Records*, expounded by the Primordial Sovereign;
- The *Lower Section: True Source of Reality*, transmitted by the Most High.

Together, they comprise several thousand words. Through nights of vigil and days of diligent study, deep reflection led me to awaken to the truth: within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—this is the principle of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent, the pattern of the sun and moon’s union. Qi generates water, and water generates qi—this is also the principle of the heart and kidneys’ communion.

By comparing the images of things, the Dao is not distant from humanity. Matching *jia* and *geng* confirms the precision of the golden elixir. Extracting and augmenting *mao* and *you* naturally ensures the accuracy of the fire times. Red lead and black lead, when thoroughly refined, do not form the great medicine. Golden liquor and jade liquor, only at the culmination, become the returned elixir.

From non-being into being, one must ever hold the mind of martial endeavor. From below ascending to the heights, one gradually enters the realm of the subtle and formless. Drawing out lead and adding mercury dissolves the yin of the two eights. Exchanging bones and refining form causes the yang of the nine threes to grow. The clarity or turbidity of the water’s source is discerned at the moment of *ji ji* (completion). The inner vision of true emptiness is recognized on the day of *zuo wang* (sitting in forgetfulness).

The profound subtleties of the mysterious mechanism cannot be fully expressed in written methods. The wondrous principles of the Numinous Treasure may be employed to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. Thus, they are synthesized into the three vehicles’ methods, titled *Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure*.

The sacred words of the Great Dao dare not be kept for private use. I transmit them to Dongbin, and when the Dao is achieved, do not conceal them—pass them on to those who come after.

**Four Gates of the Lesser Vehicle’s Method for Peace and Longevity**
**First Gate: Harmonizing Yin and Yang**

The *Jade Scripture* states: The Great Dao has no form, and cannot be perceived by sight or hearing. The Great Dao has no name, and cannot be measured by calculations or reckoning. It gives rise to form through the Dao, and names are established based on form. The greatest of names are Heaven and Earth. Heaven attains the Qian Dao and accumulates qi, covering all below. Earth attains the Kun Dao and supports substance, bearing all above. Between the covering and bearing, above and below are separated by eighty-four thousand li, and their qi and substance cannot interact. Heaven seeks Qian within Kun and returns to the center of Earth, its yang carrying yin upward. Earth seeks Kun within Qian and returns to the center of Heaven, its yin embracing yang downward. With each ascent and descent, they move through the Dao, and thus Heaven and Earth endure forever.

The *True Origin* states: Between Heaven and Earth, that which is close to above is yang; from above downward forty-two thousand li is called the yang position. That which is close to below is yin; from below upward forty-two thousand li is called the yin position. Once forms and names exist, they cannot escape measurement. Consider one year: four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four qi, seventy-two hou, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty periods. Twelve periods make one day, five days make one hou, three hou make one qi, two qi make one node, two nodes make one season, and four seasons make one year. The year begins with the Winter Solstice node, at which time yang ascends from within Earth. Each qi lasts fifteen days, ascending seven thousand li. Three qi make one node, one node forty-five days, with yang ascending a total of twenty-one thousand li. Two nodes make one season, one season ninety days, with yang ascending a total of forty-two thousand li, reaching precisely the center of Heaven and Earth, where yang meets the yin position. At this point, yang is half within yin, its qi becoming warm, corresponding to the Spring Equinox node. Beyond this, yang ascends into the yang position, now truly gaining qi and ascending, just as after forty-five days comes the Beginning of Summer. After the Beginning of Summer, forty-five days bring the Summer Solstice. At the Summer Solstice node, yang has ascended a total of eighty-four thousand li to reach Heaven, where yang is within yang, its qi hot. Accumulated yang generates yin, and one yin arises within two yang. Beginning with the Summer Solstice node, yin descends from within Heaven. Each qi lasts fifteen days, descending seven thousand li. Three qi make one node, one node forty-five days, with yin descending a total of twenty-one thousand li. Two nodes make one season, one season ninety days, with yin descending a total of forty-two thousand li to reach the center of Heaven and Earth, where yin meets the yang position. At this time, yin is half within yang, its qi becoming cool, corresponding to the Autumn Equinox node. Beyond this, yin descends into the yin position, now truly gaining qi and descending, just as after forty-five days comes the Beginning of Winter. After the Beginning of Winter, forty-five days bring the Winter Solstice. At the Winter Solstice node, yin has descended a total of eighty-four thousand li to reach Earth, where yin is within yin, its qi cold. Accumulated yin generates yang, and one yang arises within two yin. After the Winter Solstice, one yang ascends again, circulating endlessly as before, never deviating from the Dao.

At the Winter Solstice, yang is born, ascending to return to Heaven. At the Summer Solstice, yin is born, descending to return to Earth. When yang ascends to Heaven at the Summer Solstice, one yin arrives; when yin descends to Earth at the Winter Solstice, one yang arrives—hence the term "Winter Solstice." After yang ascends above, it passes the Spring Equinox to enter the yang position, departing from the yin position; yin descends below, passing the Autumn Equinox to enter the yin position, departing from the yang position—hence the terms "Spring Equinox" and "Autumn Equinox." After yang ascends at the Winter Solstice, from above downward, yin does not cease descending; the descending yin is merely the residual yin within yang, dissipating within the yang position. Even if it descends to its proper position and encounters ascending yang, its qi is exhausted. After yin descends at the Summer Solstice, from below upward, yang does not cease ascending; the ascending yang is merely the residual yang within yin, dissipating within the yin position. Even if it ascends to its proper position and encounters descending yin, its qi is exhausted. The ascent and descent of yin and yang, above and below, do not exceed eighty-four thousand li, and their coming and going cannot escape three hundred sixty days. Through the four qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, one recognizes yin and yang; through the eight nodes of yang ascending and yin descending, one understands Heaven and Earth. Measuring this with the celestial mechanism, one may grasp the remnants of the Great Dao’s thread. If one relies on superficial learning to weigh the Dao of Heaven and Earth, how can calculations ever comprehend it?

For example: The Dao gives birth to the myriad things, and Heaven and Earth are the greatest among them. Humans are the most spiritually endowed among things, and when seeking the Dao separately, humans are akin to Heaven and Earth. The heart is likened to Heaven, the kidneys to Earth; the liver is the yang position, the lungs the yin position. The distance between heart and kidneys is eight cun and four fen, comparable to the space between Heaven’s covering and Earth’s bearing. Qi is likened to yang, and fluids to yin. The hours of *zi* and *wu* correspond to the Summer and Winter Solstice nodes; the hours of *mao* and *you* correspond to the Spring and Autumn Equinox nodes. One day is likened to one year, and the eight trigrams’ hours of the day correspond to the eight nodes. At the *zi* hour, qi is born within the kidneys; at the *mao* hour, qi reaches the liver. The liver is yang, and its qi flourishes as yang ascends into the yang position—this is the analogy of the Spring Equinox. At the *wu* hour, qi reaches the heart, and accumulated qi generates fluids—this is the analogy of yang ascending to Heaven at the Summer Solstice, where yin is born. At the *wu* hour, fluids are born within the heart; at the *you* hour, fluids reach the lungs.

The lungs are yin, and their fluids flourish as yin descends into the yin position—this is the analogy of the Autumn Equinox. At the *zi* hour, fluids reach the kidneys, and accumulated fluids generate qi—this is the analogy of yin descending to Earth at the Winter Solstice, where yang is born. Circulating endlessly, like the cycles of the sun and moon, without loss or deficiency, one may thereby prolong life.

The *True Formula* states: Heaven and Earth attain unity through the Dao, yet upon entering, one receives form from father and mother. Within form, form is born, and one drifts ever farther from the Dao. After the fetus is complete and qi is full, the six desires and seven emotions dissipate primordial yang, causing true qi to scatter and flee. Though qi and fluids naturally generate one another, they no longer follow Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent. With each exhalation, primordial qi departs; with each inhalation, primordial qi enters, connecting with Heaven and Earth’s qi. Yet once drawn in, it cannot be retained—following the breath, it departs again. The qi of one’s own palace is instead seized by Heaven and Earth. Thus, scattered qi struggles to generate fluids, and scant fluids struggle to generate qi.

When qi is at its peak, employ the *mao* trigram in daily practice: inhale more and exhale less, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen. That which naturally ascends from below does not exit; that which enters from without temporarily abides. The two qi converge, accumulating to generate the fluids of the five viscera. The more one returns to the origin, the greater the accumulation. With daily cultivation and persistent effort, results will appear in due course.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: To meet the eldest son of yang, one must inhale more and exhale less. Let the children contend with one another, and in time, seek the true. This is the method of accumulating qi to generate fluids, and accumulating fluids to generate qi—matching and pairing qi and fluids to engender one another. In practice, no more than a year is needed; with concentrated effort, one achieves threefold progress in one. A hundred days as a term, and signs appear within ten. One gains appetite and dispels illness, clarity in head and eyes, lightness in heart and abdomen, strength with little fatigue. At times, the sound of wind and thunder arises within the abdomen—countless other signs cannot all be recorded.

Explanation: The "eldest son of yang" refers to *qian* seeking *xu* from *kun*, like qi ascending upward. The "son" is qi, rising from the kidneys. The "daughter" is fluid, descending from the heart. Their contention causes ascent and descent. By restraining qi, fluids are generated; when matched in balance, true water is naturally obtained after a time.

**Gathering and Dispersing Water and Fire, Second Scroll**

The *Golden Teachings* state: The Great Dao is lofty yet without superior—look up, and its summit cannot be seen. The Great Dao is lowly yet without inferior—look down, and its base cannot be seen. It has no beginning, so its origin cannot be perceived; it has no end, so its conclusion cannot be seen. Within the Great Dao, Heaven and Earth are born. Heaven and Earth possess the measures of high and low. Within Heaven and Earth, yin and yang exist, with their cycles of beginning and end. Observing upward and downward, one may fathom their mechanism. Contemplating beginning and end, calculating their measures, one may grasp their principles. From this, the Great Dao may be known.

The *True Origin* states: From the positions of Heaven and Earth above and below, one knows their height and depth. From the cycles of yin and yang’s beginning and end, one knows the sequence of Heaven’s Dao. Heaven and Earth do not depart from their measures, which conclude in one year. Yin and yang do not lose their proper order, dividing into the eight nodes. At the Winter Solstice, one yang is born; at the Spring Equinox, yang is half within yin. Beyond this, pure yang prevails, and yin is exhausted. At the Summer Solstice, yang reaches its extreme, and one yin is born—its ascent and descent follow as before. Though the cycles of above and below, beginning and end, do not fully encompass the Great Dao, they do not depart from its essence. To comprehend the Great Dao, one must model it upon Heaven and Earth and examine the proper order of yin and yang.

Analogy: The heart and kidneys are likened to Heaven and Earth; qi and fluids to yin and yang; one day to one year. The daily use of the *gen* trigram corresponds to the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) node in a year; the *qian* trigram to the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) node. Within Heaven and Earth, that which is closer to below is yin. From below upward, forty-two thousand *li* is called the yin position. At the Winter Solstice, yang is born and ascends; at the time of *Lichun*, yang rises within the yin position to twenty-one thousand *li*—this is yang’s struggle to overcome yin. Within Heaven and Earth, that which is closer to above is yang. From above downward, forty-two thousand *li* is called the yang position. At the Summer Solstice, yin is born and descends; at the time of *Lidong*, yin descends, departing sixty-three thousand *li* from Heaven and twenty-one thousand *li* from Earth—this is yin attaining its position and yang being cut off.

Within a year, *Lichun* corresponds to the *gen* trigram in a day’s hours. Kidney qi transmits downward to the bladder, weak and struggling to ascend within fluids. Within a year, *Lidong* corresponds to the *qian* trigram in a day’s hours. Heart fluids descend, about to return to the origin and re-enter the kidneys—this is the time of yin’s flourishing and yang’s severance.

The cause of human illness lies in the disharmony of yin and yang, with yang weak and yin excessive—thus, illness is common. The *True Formula* states: At *Lichun*, yang ascends from below; before long, yang is half within yin. At the *gen* trigram, qi is faint in the *chou* and *yin* hours. At *Lidong*, yin descends from above; before long, yin is half within yang. At the *qian* trigram, qi scatters in the *xu* and *hai* hours. Such is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Yet humans, when qi is faint at the *gen* trigram, do not know the means to nurture qi; when qi scatters at the *qian* trigram, do not understand the principle of gathering qi. Day and night, the six desires and seven emotions dissipate primordial yang, causing true qi to weaken and scatter, true fluids to fail to generate. Thus, one cannot attain the longevity of Heaven and Earth—this is the reason.

Therefore, the ancients practiced *zhun* in the morning and *meng* in the evening, employing two trigrams daily to achieve long life in the world. *Zhun* in the morning takes the meaning of one yang coiled and unextended. For oneself, one nurtures and extends it, preventing dissipation.

At dusk, *meng* takes the meaning of an unenlightened child seeking me to attain brightness and abandon darkness—this is the principle of yin seeking yang. For oneself, one obscures and then illuminates it, preventing its dissipation.

Thus, at sunrise, when the *gen* trigram governs, one nurtures primordial qi. Do not let profit or fame stir the heart, nor let likes and dislikes disturb the mind. Instead, don a robe and sit in stillness to cultivate qi. Banish thoughts and forget emotions, gently performing *daoyin*. Alternately stretch and contract the hands and feet three to five times, so that the qi of the four limbs arises evenly, inwardly preserving primordial qi to ascend and gather at the heart’s palace. One may swallow saliva once or twice and rub the head and face twenty to thirty times, exhaling the foul, stagnant qi accumulated through the night. With time, one’s complexion will glow with radiance, and the skin will become lustrous.

The *gen* trigram nurtures primordial qi. Furthermore, at sunset, when the *qian* trigram governs, one gathers primordial qi. Enter a chamber and sit in stillness, swallowing qi and contracting the external kidneys. Swallowing qi draws the heart’s fire downward. Contracting the external kidneys gathers the bladder’s qi inward. The *qian* trigram gathers primordial qi. When the upper and lower kidney fires unite, the three fires merge into one, warming and replenishing the lower elixir field. Without fluids, one gathers qi to generate fluids; with fluids, one refines them to produce qi. This is called "gathering fire" or "the Supreme Unity containing true qi."

In the early morning, swallowing saliva, rubbing the face, and alternately stretching the hands and feet is called "dispersing fire" or "minor refinement of form." As the *Daoist Essentials* states:

> When blossoms wither and leaves fall in late autumn,
> The consort grows weary of ascending the high tower.
> To harmonize ruler and people,
> One must frequently gather after the feast.

This means drawing in the heart’s qi and gathering the bladder’s qi, preventing dissipation so they may unite with kidney qi to receive the qi of the *kan* trigram—the newly arisen qi from the sea. One must begin at the Winter Commencement solar term and continue until results appear. The practice should not exceed a year; the work of one merges into three, with a hundred days as the period and verification appearing in ten. The complexion will grow luminous, the skin full and joyful, the lower elixir field warm, urination reduced, the four limbs light and strong, the spirit clear and refreshed, and chronic illnesses entirely dissolved.

If one cherishes time and practices without weariness, even within the work of harmonizing yin and yang, slight results may appear. This method is then incorporated into daily practice, with the *gen* trigram added. When the three *yuan* of the *qian* trigram take effect, one ceases upon verification. The three *yuan* are *qian*, *gen*, and *zhen*.

A Commentary states: When flowers wither and leaves fall in late autumn, it is like the time when a person’s qi weakens at dusk—yang qi scatters and fails to ascend, hence the saying, “Too weary to climb the high tower.” The tower refers to the *chonglou* (double-storied structure). The heart is the sovereign fire, the bladder the ministerial fire; swallowing qi and drawing in the external kidneys cause the heart and external kidneys to unite their qi as one—this is called *hehui* (harmonious union). *Yan* means swallowing, and *shou* means drawing in.

If the morning practice is unbroken, this method becomes the foundation. **The Third: The Union of Dragon and Tiger**

The *Jingao* says: When the Great Primal first divided, there was the Great Beginning; within the Great Beginning was the Great Non-Being; within the Great Non-Being was the Great Void; within the Great Void was the Great Emptiness; and within the Great Emptiness was the Great Substance. The Great Substance is Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth, clear and turbid, take the form of an egg with a dark and yellow hue—merely one thing within the Great Emptiness. When yang ascends to the Heavenly Supreme Ultimate, it generates yin, which in profound obscurity embraces yang and descends. When yin descends to the Earthly Supreme Ultimate, it generates yang, which in a state of indistinctness bears yin and ascends. With one ascent and one descent—yin descending and yang ascending—Heaven and Earth follow the Dao, and the myriad things are born and formed.

The *Zhenyuan* says: Heaven is like an overturned basin, making it difficult for yang to ascend when it reaches its limit. Earth is like a stone slab, making it difficult for yin to penetrate when it reaches its limit. At the Winter Solstice, yang within the earth ascends; at the Summer Solstice, when it reaches Heaven, yang attains the Supreme Ultimate and generates yin. The reason yin is generated is that yang arises from within yin, emerging from the earth in a state of indistinctness—within qi there is water, though this water has no form. When the Summer Solstice reaches Heaven, it transforms into water; this is yang attaining the Supreme Ultimate and generating yin. At the Summer Solstice, yin within Heaven descends; at the Winter Solstice, when it reaches Earth, yin attains the Supreme Ultimate and generates yang. The reason yang is generated is that yin emerges from within yang, issuing from Heaven in a state of profound obscurity—within water there is qi, though this qi has no form. When the Winter Solstice reaches Earth, accumulated water generates qi; this is yin attaining the Supreme Ultimate and generating yang.

As an analogy: Compare the body’s exterior to the Great Emptiness, the heart and kidneys to Heaven and Earth, qi and fluids to yin and yang, and the hours of *zi* and *wu* to winter and summer. The *zi* hour corresponds to the *kan* trigram, when qi is born in the kidneys. The *wu* hour corresponds to the *li* trigram, when qi reaches the heart. When kidney qi and heart qi unite, the Supreme Ultimate generates fluid. The reason fluid is generated is that qi arises from within the kidneys—within qi there is true water, though this water has no form. When the *li* trigram reaches the heart and meets heart qi, the Supreme Ultimate generates fluid in this manner. When fluid is born in the heart (*li* trigram) and reaches the kidneys (*kan* trigram), the fluid unites with kidney water, and the Supreme Ultimate regenerates qi. The reason qi is generated is that fluid arises from within the heart—within fluid there is true qi, though this qi has no form. When the *kan* trigram reaches the kidneys and meets kidney water, the Supreme Ultimate generates qi in this manner. This can be likened to yang ascending and yin descending, reaching the Supreme Ultimate and generating one another. The yin and yang thus generated contain water within yang and qi within yin.

The *Zhenjue* says: Qi is born in the kidneys, and within qi there is true water. Fluid is born in the heart, and within fluid there is true qi. True water and true qi are the true Dragon and true Tiger. When yang reaches Heaven and struggles to ascend, the Supreme Ultimate generates yin. When yin reaches Earth and struggles to penetrate, the Supreme Ultimate generates yang. Such is the principle of Heaven and Earth. Only humans cannot compare to Heaven and Earth because the six desires and seven emotions, stirred by external things, scatter their original yang and dissipate their true qi. When kidney qi (*li* trigram) reaches the heart, the spirit and consciousness settle inwardly; the breath enters slowly through the nose and exits gently, continuous yet subtle. Saliva fills the mouth—do not spit or swallow it. Naturally, kidney qi and heart qi unite, and the Supreme Ultimate generates fluid. When fluid unites with true water, true qi clings to fluid, and true water clings to qi. Though they are not inherently united, within fluid there is true qi, and within qi there is true water. They intermingle, cling to one another, and descend—this is called the *jiaogou* (union) of Dragon and Tiger. If the firing times are without error and the withdrawal and addition are appropriate, after three hundred days of nurturing, the true embryo forms into the great medicine. This is the foundation of refining the body, burning away the physical form, attaining the origin, and transcending the mundane.

The *Daoyao* says: When the primal qi first returns to its original movement, true yang is about to reach the *li* palace. Seize the true Dragon and true Tiger—within the Jade Pool, spring waters flow gently. This is to prevent the leakage of original qi and the loss of true water beyond the body. If qi scatters, fluid is difficult to generate; if fluid is scant, there is no true qi. If qi and water do not unite, how can the great medicine be formed? During this year, take the Winter Solstice as the beginning; within the day, take the *li* trigram as the period. For those who embrace the Dao in later years, whose roots are unstable, and who suffer from depletion and insufficiency of qi, ten years of depletion require one year of practice to restore—this is called *caibu huandan* (gathering and replenishing the elixir). If the replenishment exceeds the required measure, cease this method and practice *shuihuo jiji* (the harmony of water and fire). This can prolong life and extend years—it is called the *renxian* (human immortal). The effects of the practice cannot be fully recorded. If the replenishment is sufficient, sweet saliva will arise in the mouth, the mind’s afflictions will vanish, desires will not stir, the hundred bones will be free of illness, and within the darkness, the radiance of the spirit will appear before the eyes like lightning. Taking the Winter Solstice as the starting point and practicing the method for three hundred days, the embryonic immortal is complete.

A Commentary states: Externally, the *wu* hour is the *li* palace, and the great yang is the true yang. Within the person, the heart is the *li* palace, and original yang is the true Dragon; the true Tiger is the water within the kidneys. The true Dragon is the qi within heart fluid; the mouth is the Jade Pool, and saliva is the spring water.

**The Fourth: Refining the Elixir**

The *Jingao* says: Heaven and Earth are the forms of the great Dao. Yin and yang are the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—within form there is qi.

Clouds, mist, rain, and dew—within qi there are images. Earth’s qi ascends, rising to become clouds and dispersing to become rain. Heaven’s qi descends, scattering into mist and condensing into dew. When accumulated yin exceeds, dew transforms into frost and then snow. When accumulated yang exceeds, mist becomes smoke, clouds, and rosy dawn. Within yin, yang lies concealed; if yang qi does not descend, it strikes and collides to generate thunder and lightning. Within yang, yin lies concealed; if yin qi does not congeal, it hardens to produce hail and graupel. When yin and yang fail to unite, they oppose each other to generate lightning. When yin and yang are mismatched, their chaotic union produces rainbows. Accumulated true yang forms spirits, which adorn the heavens as stars. Accumulated true yin forms shapes, which strengthen the earth as soil and stone. The greatest of stars are the sun and moon; the most precious of soil and stone are gold and jade. Yin and yang manifest in the visible forms of the sun and moon above, and gold and jade below.

*The True Origin* states: Yin cannot generate without yang; yang cannot complete without yin. Accumulated yang becomes spirit, adorning the heavens in grandeur—such are the sun and moon. The sun and moon are true yang that achieves completion through true yin. Accumulated yin forms shapes, strengthening the earth in preciousness—such are gold and jade. Gold and jade are true yin that attains generation through true yang.

Practice during the *xu* and *hai* hours: in the *Li* trigram, gather the medicine; in the *Qian* trigram, advance the fire. As an analogy: true yang corresponds to the true qi within heart fluid; true yin corresponds to the true water within kidney qi. True water cannot generate without true qi; true qi cannot complete without true water. When true water and true qi harmonize in the *Li* trigram—above the heart and below the lungs—they cling to each other like mother and child, or husband and wife in mutual affection.

From *Li* to *Dui*, when the *Dui* trigram’s yin flourishes and yang weakens, it resembles the moon’s waning crescent or gold and jade hidden in darkness, awaiting the dawn when their measure is fulfilled to shine anew. Gold and jade, refined by yang to generate yin, become treasures when qi is sufficient—this is achieved by advancing yang to fullness. The sun and moon renew their brightness when their measure is fulfilled and they receive the soul. This is analogous to advancing the fire in the *Qian* trigram, refining yang without declining flame, so that yang perpetually regenerates through incremental addition.

*The True Formula* states: When the Dragon and Tiger unite in the *Li* trigram, it is called "gathering the medicine." When the time arrives at the *Qian* trigram, qi and fluid prepare to return to their origin, generating above the bladder, below the spleen and stomach, before the kidneys, behind the navel, to the left of the liver, to the right of the lungs, to the right of the small intestine, and to the left of the large intestine. At this moment, spleen qi flourishes and lung qi thrives, while heart qi ceases and liver qi weakens. True qi, originally united with yang qi, now finds yang qi diminished and has nothing to cling to—practice at this time is laborious, yet the gathering and union must occur precisely then.

With spirit and awareness inwardly guarded, the breath flows gently through the nose. The abdomen subtly presses against the navel and kidneys; when the heat becomes too intense, slightly relax the pressure, gently restraining the navel. Before heat arises, tighten the restraint; as warmth grows, maintain steady pressure, allowing the mind to roam freely until it fills the cosmos—this is called "restraining the Yang Gate to refine the elixir." Thus, qi does not ascend but unites with true water, passing through the spleen palace and, with each breath, circulating into the life palace of the Yellow Court. As qi and fluid transform, they first become essence, then pearl, then mercury, then cinnabar, and finally gold—this is called the Golden Elixir. Its achievement is no small matter.

*The Essentials of the Dao* states: Gathering the medicine relies on the Jade Hare—heart qi is the medicine, and kidney water is the Jade Hare. Union must be facilitated by the Yellow Matron. When they meet in Yongzhou, the *Qian* trigram, perform a melody of the Yang Song. This practice aligns with daily cultivation for gathering the medicine.

For those seeking to restore vitality in later years, apply the method of "one supplement for every ten depletions"—this is called "refining mercury to supplement the cinnabar field." Once the supplement’s measure is fulfilled, cease daily practice.

Gather the medicine in the *Li* trigram and refine it in the *Qian* trigram, restraining the Yang Gate. In spring and winter, gather more and refine less—*Qian* requires one part effort, while *Li* demands twice as much. In autumn and summer, gather less and refine more—*Li* requires one part effort, while *Qian* demands twice as much. Adjust gathering and refining according to the seasonal flourishing of qi. With practice, results will manifest, extending years and abiding in the world as a Human Immortal.

If, after fulfilling the supplement’s measure, results are evident, advance with care and discipline. After one hundred days of gathering the medicine, its potency is complete. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo solidifies. After three hundred days, true qi is born, and the embryonic immortal is perfected.

Once the medicine’s potency is complete, advance the fire by increasing the measure—this is called "fire timing." After the sacred embryo solidifies, increase the fire timing to the measure of the Small Celestial Cycle. When the embryo is rounded and true qi is born, advance the fire timing—this is called the "Celestial Cycle fire timing."

Only by gathering the medicine through the union of Dragon and Tiger, and refining it by advancing the fire, does one enter the Dao. One must retreat to seclusion, focusing the mind on inner observation, so that inner visions do not leak out and outer distractions do not intrude—like a woman nurturing a fetus or a dragon tending its pearl. Even in eating, sleeping, speaking, or silence, one must move like an infant or a maiden in her chamber, ever cautious of loss or harm, never allowing the heart to stray from the Dao for even a moment.

A Commentary states: The medicine is the true qi within the heart; the hare is the true water within the kidneys; the Yellow Matron is the fluid within the spleen. They harmonize qi and water, entering the Yellow Court. Yongzhou is the *Qian* trigram, where one restrains the flanks and abdomen—also called restraining the Yang Gate.

Here concludes the four gates of the lesser vehicle, leading to Human Immortality. *Secret Transmission of the Orthodox Yang Immortal’s Numinous Treasure Complete Methods*, Volume One.

**Three Gates of the Middle Vehicle for Long Life and Deathlessness**

**Fifth: Flying Gold Essence Behind the Elbow**

The *Golden Proclamation* states: Yin and Yang ascend and descend, never beyond the bounds of Heaven and Earth. The sun and moon revolve, yet move outside Heaven and Earth. Their rising and setting in the east and west divide day and night; their coming and going in the south and north determine cold and heat. Unceasing day and night accumulate into months—this is the lunar phase. The accumulation of months into a year follows the principle of *lü* arising from *lü* and *lü* arising from *lü*. The sun and moon’s movements align with the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, never departing from the numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*. Though the generation of the myriad things depends on Yin and Yang, their transformation also relies on the sun and moon.

The *True Origin* states: The form of Heaven and Earth resembles an egg. The Six Harmonies within are round as a sphere. The sun and moon rise and set, revolving above one Heaven and below one Earth. Above and below, east and west, they circle like a flying wheel. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, traveling the Yang path; the moon rises in the west and sets in the east, traveling the Yin path. Within a single day, they divide day and night. After the winter solstice, the sun rises from the south and moves north. After the summer solstice, the sun rises from the north and moves south. Winter’s night is summer’s day; summer’s night is winter’s day. Within a year, they determine cold and heat. The sun and moon each measure eight hundred and forty *li* in circumference. Four *chi* make one *bu*, and three hundred and sixty *bu* make one *li*. Eight *ke* and twenty *fen* make one *shi*, and twelve *shi* make one day. One month consists of thirty days, totaling three hundred and sixty *shi*, amounting to three thousand *ke* and one hundred and eighty thousand *fen*.

Now, Yang moves through *Qian*, its number being nine. Yin moves through *Kun*, its number being six. The spirit (*hun*) is born within the lunar phase (*po*), originating from the dawn sun. Since nine does not pair with six, three days later, the lunar phase gives birth to the spirit. In one day and night—one hundred *ke* and six thousand *fen*—the spirit advances seventy *li* within the lunar phase. Over six days and nights, it advances four hundred and twenty *li*, reaching half within the lunar phase—this is called the first quarter. After another six days and nights, advancing another four hundred and twenty *li*, totaling eight hundred and forty *li*, the spirit fully occupies the lunar phase, and Yang fills the Yin position—this is called the full moon.

Beginning on the sixteenth day, the spirit generates the lunar phase. Over six days and nights, advancing four hundred and twenty *li*, the lunar phase reaches half within the spirit—this is called the last quarter. After another six days and nights, advancing another four hundred and twenty *li*, totaling eight hundred and forty *li*, the lunar phase fully occupies the spirit. The remaining light in the moon exists because six does not exhaust nine; thus, three days later, the lunar phase fills the palace—this is called the dark moon.

After the new moon, nine arises from six. Before the dark moon, six arises from nine. Though the numbers are not yet exhausted, the next cycle begins in due course. Days accumulate into months, and months into years. Speaking of a year in terms of months, the six *lü* and six *lü* begin with six, exhausting the six positions. Six sixes make thirty-six—the completion number of Yin. Speaking of a year in terms of days, five days make one *hou*, and seventy-two *hou* make the number eight nines. Reaching the double nine, the number begins with nine, exhausting the six positions. Six nines make fifty-four—the completion number of Yang. One six and one nine together make fifteen. Fifteen is the number of *qi*. The twenty-four *qi* correspond to the eight nodes, revealing the proper ascent and descent of Yin and Yang. One six and one nine, when applied fourfold, transform into the Yang number two hundred and sixteen and the Yin number one hundred and forty-four, totaling three hundred and sixty to complete the celestial cycle.

By analogy: The ascent and descent of Yin and Yang within Heaven and Earth resemble the method of harmonizing the heart and kidneys, *qi* and fluids. The revolution of the sun and moon outside Heaven and Earth resembles the practice of flying gold essence behind the elbow. The union of the sun and moon resembles the method of advancing and reducing fire. The ascent of Yang and descent of Yin are no different from the spirit and lunar phase of the sun and moon. The sun’s departure and moon’s arrival are no different from the *qi* and fluids of the heart and kidneys.

After the winter solstice, the sun rises in the *yi* position and sets in the *geng* position, with forty *ke* of daylight, moving from south to north. After the winter solstice, over nine days, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, advancing sixty *fen* to the spring equinox. Day and night balance, with the summer solstice as the term, when daylight reaches sixty *ke*, the sun rises in the *jia* position and sets in the *xin* position. After the summer solstice, over nine days, the sun moves from north to south, rising in the east and setting in the west, retreating sixty *fen* to the autumn equinox. Day and night balance, with the winter solstice as the term, when daylight returns to forty *ke*. Following the previous pattern, advancing from south to north, the number uses nine.

After the new moon, on the third day, the spirit is born, arising from the lunar phase. On the sixth day, they balance; after another six days, the spirit is complete—the number uses six. At the summer solstice of the year and the sixteenth day of the month, one employs the method of the *Li* trigram—this is the *wu* hour for humans. At the winter solstice of the year and the new moon, one employs the method of the *Kan* trigram—this is the *zi* hour for humans. Though the proper ascent and descent of Yin and Yang in Heaven and Earth and the principles of the sun and moon’s spirit and lunar phase follow numerical order, their union is sequential and their revolution without error. How could the *qi* and fluids of the human heart and kidneys, the spirit and lunar phase of the liver and lungs, though following a daily rhythm, not require adjustment over months and years?

The *True Formula* states: When Yang is born in the *Kan* trigram, it corresponds to the true *zi* hour—neither beginning nor end. The *Gen* trigram governs the *qi* of the kidneys harmonizing with the *qi* of the liver. Before the union, in a quiet chamber, don robe and clasp hands, sit upright with crossed legs, tuck in the abdomen, and after a moment, raise the body forward, chest out, and slightly tilt the head back.

Then close the double gates of the *Jiaji* behind the spine, gently fan the elbows backward once or twice, and stretch the waist. From the *Weilü* point, a fire-like sensation arises, ascending from the waist to gather at the *Jiaji*. Take care not to open the gates—immediately, the heat intensifies and the *qi* swells. Gradually open the *Jiaji* gates to release the *qi* past the barrier.

Still facing upward, tilt the head firmly back to close the upper gate. Guard against opening it, and soon the heat peaks and the *qi* surges, ascending into the crown to replenish the *Niwan* and the Sea of Marrow. Only when the body withstands cold and heat is this the foundation of longevity.

Next, employ the method of *Huandan*: proceed as before—extend the chest, stretch the waist, close the *Jiaji*, and crouch to raise the *qi* through the waist. If the fire does not rise, sit in stillness and inwardly observe; repeat the method until the fire ignites. Begin at the *chou* hour and continue until the end of *yin*. This is called *"Flying Golden Essence behind the Elbow"* or *"Drawing Lead"*, whereby kidney *qi* generates liver *qi*.

Moreover, the human spine has twenty-four vertebrae. The three lowest, from the bottom upward, correspond to the inner kidneys. The three highest, from the top downward, are called the *Heavenly Pillar*. Above the *Heavenly Pillar* lies the *Jade Capital*. Below the *Jade Capital* and above the *Weilü* point, where the inner kidneys align, are eighteen vertebrae—nine above and nine below—collectively called the *Double Gates*. After one hundred days of practice, the *qi* traverses all eighteen and enters the *Niwan*.

This must be performed during the *Kan* trigram’s true Yang hour. This is *"Flying Golden Essence behind the Elbow"*. The *Li* trigram governs the gathering of the elixir, the *Qian* trigram the stoking of the fire to refine it. After restraining the *Yang* gate for one hundred days, the *Golden Essence* flies into the brain. At one hundred days, the elixir’s power is complete. With a single thrust through the three gates, it ascends directly into the upper palace of *Niwan*.

Begin with the *Kan* trigram and conclude with the *Gen* trigram. When gathering the elixir under the *Li* trigram, no kidney *qi* unites with it; instead, liver *qi* naturally generates heart *qi*. The two *qi* become purely Yang, dissolving the eight Yin. Steaming the lungs, the lung fluid descends, enveloping the true *qi*. Daily, a grain of millet’s worth enters the *Yellow Court*—only then is it the material for the inner elixir. After one hundred days without error, the elixir’s power is complete.

When gathering the elixir under the *Li* trigram, follow the method precisely, inwardly observing with ever-greater refinement. For stoking the fire and restraining the *Yang* gate under the *Qian* trigram, begin with the *Dui* trigram and conclude with the *Qian* trigram. After another hundred days, *"Flying Golden Essence behind the Elbow"* proceeds from the *Kan* trigram to the *Zhen* trigram. When gathering the elixir under the *Li* trigram, the method remains unchanged, aligning with practice from the *Kun* to the *Qian* trigram. After three hundred days without error, the sacred embryo naturally solidifies. At three hundred days, the sacred embryo is firm.

The method of restraining the *Yang* gate begins with the *Kun* trigram and concludes with the *Qian* trigram. After another hundred days, the *Niwan* is fully replenished, and one reverts from old age to youth, no longer resembling ordinary people. The elixir is gathered, the embryo perfected, and true *qi* is born—round as a pellet, red as a tangerine—permanently settled in the *Dantian*, making one an immortal upon the earth.

After three hundred days, cease gathering the elixir under the *Li* trigram and restraining the *Yang* gate under the *Kun* trigram, then practice the *Jade Fluid Returning Elixir* method. Thus, only after the winter solstice does one begin the practice. After three hundred days, the embryo is complete, the *qi* is full, the inner elixir is achieved, and true *qi* is born. Only then is this the reversal of the Five Phases and the inversion of the Three Fields.

Before beginning the practice, first harmonize Yin and Yang to ensure *qi* and fluids generate one another, ceasing only when verification appears. Next, gather and disperse water and fire to solidify the root and ensure *qi* flows and fluids infuse, ceasing only when verification appears. Then unite the *Gou* Dragon and Tiger to refine the elixir, gathering and supplementing the returning elixir while forging lead and mercury, ceasing only when verification appears. When the count of *"Ten Losses and One Gain"* is complete and *qi* and fluids generate one another, cease only when verification appears.

The above practice is a lesser vehicle method, sufficient for prolonging life and extending years. Only after supplementation is complete and firmness verified may one select a month—specifically the winter solstice—and within that month, a day—specifically the *jiazi* day—and within that day, an hour—specifically the hours of the *Kan*, *Li*, and *Qian* trigrams—to begin.

For the first hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Gen* and from *Dui* to *Qian*. After two hundred days, proceed from *Kan* to *Zhen* and from *Kun* to *Qian*. For all such practice, one must be in a secluded chamber within a tranquil dwelling, far from women and girls, ensuring no sound of chickens or dogs reaches the ears, no foul odors enter the nose, no flavors pass the lips, and the seven emotions and six desires are extinguished. Regulate the quantity of food and drink, and maintain moderation in cold and heat. Even in waking and sleeping, guard against loss or damage. If practice is not diligent, the Dao will be difficult to achieve. After three hundred days, observe the results.

The *Dao Essentials* states: *"Sun and moon move together in the *Fu* trigram; at the *zi* hour, crouch and ascend for several days to open the gates. Greedily hasten to Yangzhou for the gathering; under the *Li* trigram, unite the *Gou*, and the six palaces’ fire fills the Golden Field of *Qian*.*
Explanation: *"Sun and moon move together in the *Fu* trigram"* refers to the time when a single Yang is born—in the day, the *zi* hour; in the year, the winter solstice. This is the selection of month, day, and hour. *"Crouch and ascend"* was described in the previous method. *"Several days"* means a fixed hundred days. *"Opening the gates"* means first opening the middle gate, then the upper gate. *"Greedily hasten to Yangzhou for the gathering"*—in the body, this is the heart; in the day, the *wu* hour; in the trigram, *Li*. *"Gathering"* means the union of true Yin and true Yang, hence *"gathering the elixir"*. *Qian* is the six palaces; *"fire"* is *qi*. Restraining the *Yang* gate gathers the *qi*, and as the lungs are metal, the *qi* descends to the lower field below the buttocks—thus *"fire fills the Golden Field"*, meaning the *Qian* trigram’s restraint of the *Yang* gate gathers fire in the lower field.

*"On the road to Zhongnan, mountains are encountered; frequently ascend past the three gates, greedily hastening to Yangzhou for the gathering—how could it compare to the maiden burning the heavens?"*
Explanation: *"Zhongnan"* implies the sage’s hidden meaning in the *Middle Son*—the *Middle Son* is the *Kan* trigram.

*Gen* is the mountain; the mountain is the *Gen* trigram’s flying golden essence, which enters the *Xun* trigram only after two hundred days. When practicing the downward work, frequently ascend past the three gates. The greed for gathering in Yangzhou has already been discussed. How could it compare to the maiden burning the heavens? The maiden is the *Dui* trigram. Restraining the *Yang* gate continues until the *Qian* trigram, where it finally ceases.

From Yanzhou to Xuzhou, rising to walk harms the cart and ox—yet for the sake of the Nine Provinces’ joyous gathering, fire from the southwest enters Yongzhou.

**Explanation:** Yanzhou is the *Gen* trigram; Xuzhou is the *Xun* trigram. The flying golden essence departs from *Gen* and only ceases at *Xun*. "Rising to walk harms the cart and ox"—the cart is *Yang*, the ox is *Yin*, signifying the single *qi* of the spine’s *Jiaji* flying into the *Niwan* palace. The Nine Provinces in the body are the heart; in the day, the *wu* hour—identical to the earlier gathering of the elixir. The southwest is the *Kun* trigram; Yongzhou is the *Qian* trigram. Restraining *Yang* from *Kun* to *Qian* ceases only after three hundred days of practice. This is the daily work, called the "Three Primes’ application."

The flying golden essence enters the brain, returning the lower field to the upper field. Gathering the elixir in the lower field returns it to the middle field to refine the medicine; advancing the fire from the middle field returns it to the lower field—this is called the "Three Primes’ work." The method of the Middle Vehicle is already that of an earthly immortal, and one ceases only upon seeing verification. At first, one may notice frequent startling dreams and palpitations, while the four limbs and six viscera’s ailments heal without treatment. In a dark room with eyes closed, a radiant light like a canopy encircles the body. The Golden Gate and Jade Lock seal firmly, preventing dream emissions or leaks. With a thunderous roar, the joints’ *qi* flows freely. In dreams, one may embrace an infant and return, or soar freely at will. The eight perverse *qi* cannot enter; the heart’s realm is naturally cleansed of desire. Inward contemplation is bright and unobscured; by day, the spirit’s countenance is clear and refined; by night, the cinnabar field is naturally warm. All these are verifications of obtaining the elixir. Once verified as correct, one must diligently regulate practice, augmenting with the previous method. After three hundred days, the fetal immortal’s gestation is complete. Only after its completion does one proceed to the subsequent work.

**The Sixth: Jade Fluid Returning Elixir**
*The Jade Book* states: True Yin and true Yang mutually engender and complete one another. That which appears above is accumulated *Yang* forming spirit. Within spirit lies form, clinging to heaven—these are the sun and moon. That which appears below is accumulated *Yin* forming shape. Within shape lies spirit, clinging to earth—these are gold and jade. The essence of gold and jade hides within mountains and rivers; their refined and radiant *qi* floats above, where the sun and moon exchange light. Plants and trees receive it, becoming auspicious omens; birds and beasts obtain it, becoming extraordinary species.

*The True Origin* states: When *Yang* ascends to heaven, the Supreme Ultimate generates *Yin*; *Yin* is insufficient while *Yang* is surplus, hence accumulated *Yang* generates spirit. When *Yin* descends to earth, the Supreme Ultimate generates *Yang*; *Yang* is insufficient while *Yin* is surplus, hence accumulated *Yin* generates shape. Above, the sun and moon; below, gold and jade—true *Yang* possesses spirit, true *Yin* possesses shape. Their *qi* intermingles, shooting upward and downward, filling heaven and earth with light. Thus, gold and jade are precious—truly for this reason. Know then that when the *qi* of gold and jade congeals in the void, it becomes auspicious mist and propitious vapor. When it enters the earth, it transforms into sweet springs and lingzhi mushrooms. People who receive it become heroes; birds and beasts who obtain it generate marvels. Though the essence of gold and jade is born from accumulated *Yin*’s shape, it embraces the *qi* of true *Yang*, further influenced by the sun and moon formed from accumulated *Yang* becoming spirit. The downward projection of true *Yin* and true *Yang* causes treasure to congeal.

**Analogy:** Accumulated *Yin* forms shape yet internally embraces true *Yang* to become gold and jade—comparable to accumulating the elixir and embracing true *qi* to become a fetal immortal. The *qi* of gold and jade entering the earth to become sweet springs and lingzhi mushrooms is like the jade fluid returning to the cinnabar field. The *qi* of gold and jade congealing in the void to become auspicious mist and propitious vapor is like refining form with *qi*. Whenever the *qi* of gold and jade surges into heaven, it rises with *Yang*. Whenever it enters the earth, it descends with *Yin*. Since it follows *Yin* and *Yang* in ascent and descent, there are four seasons in which the fluid can return to the cinnabar field. Refining form with *qi* adjusts by adding or subtracting a day according to the four seasons.

*The True Formula* states: Upon verifying the effects of gathering and supplementing, choose the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day. Apply the Three Primes’ work: after one hundred days, the elixir’s power is complete; after two hundred days, the sacred fetus is firm; after three hundred days, true *qi* is born, and the fetal immortal is perfected. Diligently regulate practice, augmenting in accordance with the seasons. Only after completing the three hundred days does one proceed with the method of returning the elixir and refining form.

The method of flying golden essence from the *Gen* trigram into the brain ceases at the *Xun* trigram—this refers to the completion of the golden essence after three hundred days. *Li* ceases gathering. The *Li* trigram stops gathering the elixir; the *Kun* trigram stops restraining the *Yang* gate. Only the *Dui* trigram begins restraining the *Yang* gate, continuing until *Qian*. Having ceased the *Li* trigram, add the swallowing method to refine form.

The swallowing method: stir the tongue between the upper palate and cheeks, first swallowing the foul and turbid saliva, then retracting the tongue’s tip to fill the Jade Pool. Saliva is generated without rinsing and is swallowed. In the three months of spring, when liver *qi* is flourishing and spleen *qi* is weak, apply the swallowing method daily using the *Li* trigram. In the three months of summer, when heart *qi* is flourishing and lung *qi* is weak, apply the swallowing method daily using the *Xun* trigram, filling the upper and lower tongue to the Jade Pool, swallowing the emptiness of both cheeks as the method. In the three months of autumn, when lung *qi* is flourishing and liver *qi* is weak, apply the swallowing method daily using the *Gen* trigram. In the three months of winter, when kidney *qi* is flourishing and heart *qi* is weak, apply the swallowing method daily using the *Zhen* trigram. The method of flying golden essence does not hinder swallowing.

In the months of the four seasons, when spleen *qi* is flourishing and kidney *qi* is weak, as people regard kidney *qi* as their root, it is weak in all four seasons.

In the eighteen days following each seasonal transition month, apply the swallowing method daily using the *Dui* trigram, continuing alongside the previous swallowing methods. Only during autumn, cease the *Gen* trigram’s practice and exclusively use the *Dui* trigram’s swallowing method.

For all swallowing methods, first follow the preceding method. If saliva does not arise between the teeth and the Jade Pool, simply fill the upper and lower tongue, close the Jade Pool, gather both cheeks, and swallow the emptiness as the method—only the *qi* is swallowed, for within *qi* there is naturally water. The swallowing of *qi* should number thirty-six to forty-nine times in one year, then eighty-one times in the next year, and one hundred eighty-one times thereafter. This is the method for verifying the return of Jade Liquid Elixir. Practicing this for no more than three years will irrigate the Cinnabar Field, bathe the Embryonic Immortal, and cause true *qi* to flourish ever more.

If one does not practice this Jade Liquid Return Elixir method but instead nurtures the Internal Elixir for three hundred days, true *qi* will only just begin to arise. Then, using the *Gen* trigram’s Flying Golden Essence, strike through the Three Passes to ascend to the Mud Pill Palace. At that point, one must practice the Golden Liquid Return Elixir method: from the crown’s center, let the golden water descend in a single stream to return to the Yellow Court, where it transforms into gold and congeals into the Elixir, called the Golden Elixir.

When practicing the Golden Liquid Return Elixir, choose a secluded chamber where wind, sunlight, and ordinary people cannot reach. Burn incense, clasp the hands, sit cross-legged, and after settling the body, rise. As soon as the fire is felt, sit upright, extinguish all thoughts and emotions, and inwardly observe the *Gen* trigram’s Flying Golden Essence entering the crown. Slightly raise the head and tilt the neck back, allowing the fire to fill the throat. Then nod forward, lower the head, and curve the neck, retracting the tongue’s tip to press against the upper palate. There, cool and refreshing water will appear, its taste sweet and fragrant, ascending to the crown’s gate and circulating through the hundred meridians. A true fragrance will naturally arise in the nose, and an extraordinary flavor will linger on the tongue. Without rinsing, swallow it down to return to the Yellow Court—this is the Golden Liquid Return Elixir.

Regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, after the Flying Golden Essence enters the brain following the *hou* method, proceed step by step with this practice, moving from *Gen* to *Xun*. At night, apply the Yang Barrier Restraining method, progressing from *Dui* to *Qian*. If one meticulously follows this method, it surpasses the previous techniques, enabling the fulfillment of one’s will. However, this only refines the form to abide in the world and attain longevity without death—it does not achieve liberation.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: "Recognize the root and foundation of the Five Phases, and you will understand the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Drink several cups of nectar, then wander drunkenly to the Moon Palace."

The explanation: "Recognize the root and foundation of the Five Phases" refers to understanding the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases, which necessitates different trigram applications for swallowing methods, thereby knowing the seasonal shifts of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. "Nectar" is Jade Liquid. "Moon Palace" is the Cinnabar Field. "Drunk" means swallowing abundantly.

"Gazing eastward at Fusang before dawn, rising behind and reclining ahead without rest, a galloping steed roams the cosmos, while the eldest son only reaches Yangzhou."

The explanation: "Gazing eastward at Fusang before dawn" refers to the time before sunrise, when the *Gen* trigram’s Flying Golden Essence rises. "Reclining ahead" is the Jade Liquid Return Elixir. "Galloping steed" is the firing of Jade Liquid to refine the form. "Roaming the cosmos" means filling the four limbs. "Eldest son" is the *Zhen* trigram. "Only reaches Yangzhou" is the *Li* trigram. Refining the form with Jade Liquid begins with the *Zhen* trigram and ends with the *Li* trigram.

After gathering the medicine for three hundred days, the embryo is complete, and the Flying Golden Essence reduces by one trigram, while the Yang Barrier Restraining remains unchanged. Cease gathering the medicine and incorporate the swallowing method, which follows the four seasons. This pertains to the method of refining the form. When adding the trigram timing to refine the form, begin with the *Zhen* trigram and conclude with the *Li* trigram, without limiting the years, months, or days—only stopping upon verification.

The body will become radiant, the spirit refined and graceful, and one will gradually develop an aversion to foul odors that offend the abdomen. Worldly emotions and attachments will naturally dissolve, true *qi* will become abundant and constantly satiating, food intake will lessen while wine capacity increases, the mortal frame will transform into spiritual awareness, and movement will be as swift as a galloping horse. The eyes will be as dark as lacquer, the body as smooth as congealed fat, white hair will turn black again, wrinkled skin will smooth out, and old age will permanently retain a youthful appearance. One will see autumn down at a hundred paces, old scars and blemishes will naturally fade, and tears, saliva, and filth will no longer appear. The Sacred Elixir will generate flavor, the numinous liquid will exude fragrance, and true fragrance and extraordinary taste will constantly linger in the mouth and nose. The saliva will congeal into refined butter, capable of curing illnesses, and the entire body will become white cream. All these are verifications of refining the form with the Jade Liquid Return Elixir.

Once verification is confirmed, one must diligently follow the method and proceed with subsequent practices according to the season.

**Golden Liquid Return Elixir, Seventh**

The *Golden Edict* states: "Accumulated yang forms spirit, and within spirit there is form—once born from the sun, the sun is born from the moon. Accumulated yin forms the body, and within the body there is spirit—once born from metal, metal is born from jade. That which follows yin and yang in arising and vanishing is the light of the sun and moon, for light arises from number, and number originates from *Qian* and *Kun*. That which follows yin and yang in ascending and descending is the *qi* of metal and jade, for *qi* arises from time, and time originates from heaven and earth."

The *True Origin* states: "The numbers of the sun and moon employ six and nine. The numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*, the *qi* of metal and jade, ascend in spring and summer and descend in autumn and winter. Ascending and descending are the seasons of heaven and earth. Metal is born from earth, earth from stone, stone from jade—this is how form manifests below. The golden crow in the sun, the jade hare in the moon, the sun awaits the moon’s essence to shine—this is how spirit manifests above."

The analogy: "The sun and moon correspond to *qi*; kidney *qi* corresponds to the moon, and heart *qi* corresponds to the sun."

Metal and jade correspond to the *essences*; kidney essence corresponds to metal, and heart essence to jade. The so-called *jade essence* originates from kidney *qi*, ascending to the heart to merge with heart *qi*. When the two *qi* intersect and pass the *Double Towers*, the mouth is sealed, and the *saliva* fills the *Jade Pool*. Swallowing it is called *jade essence returning cinnabar*; refining it upward is called *jade essence refining form*. This essence arises from the kidneys yet is born in the heart—analogous to stone emerging from earth and jade from stone.

The so-called *golden essence* occurs when kidney *qi* merges with heart *qi* without ascending, instead steaming the lungs. The lungs, as the *flowery canopy*, enshroud the two *qi*. Drawing lung essence at dawn, one guides it from the *Lower Field* upward through the *Weilü* cavity, calling it *flying golden radiance into the brain* to replenish the *Mud Pill Palace*. Once replenished, it descends from above back to the *Lower Field*, called *golden essence returning cinnabar*. After returning to the *Lower Field*, it ascends again, suffusing the four limbs and rising front and back—this is *golden essence refining form*, also illustrating how metal is born from earth.

For those refining form and flying golden radiance, one must be in a pure chamber, strictly avoiding wind and sunlight. From afar, burn incense and silently invoke: *"Three Pure Ones and Supreme Sages, may your servant dwell long in the world, transmit the Great Dao, and teach others. First, I shall practice the method of refining form, to transcend cold and heat, abstain from grain, and escape beyond yin and yang."* After the incantation, swallow.

*The True Formula* states: *"The cavity behind the tailbone is the Lower Pass; the spine’s sides are the Middle Pass; below the brain is the Upper Pass."* Begin by flying golden radiance to open the *Three Passes*. The kidneys correspond to earth, the heart to heaven, ascending to the crown to mirror the *Nine Heavens*. Jade essence refining form rises from the heart to the crown, connecting the *Nine Heavens*. After three hundred days of swallowing, the great elixir is complete, the *embryonic immortal* perfected, and true *qi* is born. Rising forward follows the old path of jade essence refining form; rising backward follows the old path of flying golden radiance. As golden radiance and jade essence circulate, verification begins with the *Kan* trigram. Afterward, rise once to the crown, lightly cover the ears with both hands, and inwardly observe. As prescribed, gently swallow the saliva. Press the tongue against the teeth, seal the *Jade Pool*, and await the essence from the upper palate before swallowing. After swallowing, rise again, concluding at the *Gen* trigram. In spring and winter, swallow once per two risings; in autumn and summer, swallow once per five risings. Each swallow’s count should not exceed fifty in autumn and summer, nor one hundred in spring and winter. After swallowing, rise forward to suffuse the head, face, limbs, and fingers until the *qi* is abundant. Rise again, concluding at the *Li* trigram. Thereafter, rising backward to swallow saliva is called *golden essence returning cinnabar*. After returning cinnabar, rise forward again—this is *golden essence refining form*. From the *Gen* trigram onward, refine form until the *Li* trigram. At the *Dui* trigram, restrain the *Yang Pass* until the *Qian* trigram. Rising backward to the crown, then descending, is called *golden essence returning cinnabar*. The *qi* of the golden elixir rising forward from below is *golden essence refining form*. When golden blossoms appear like jade trees, if the golden essence returning cinnabar has not yet reached the *Lower Origin* but rises both forward and backward, it is called *fire rising to incinerate the body*—this occurs when golden essence returning cinnabar and refining form rise simultaneously. In such practices, one must be meticulous, resolute, and unwavering, proceeding only until verification is achieved.

*The Dao Essentials* states: *"After rising, close the ears all night, drink the golden waves in due time, and feast until reaching Qingzhou before stopping. At sunset, listen again to the yang song."* The explanation: *"After rising, close the ears all night"* refers to the practice of golden essence returning cinnabar, where one must fly golden radiance from behind the elbow, striking the *Three Passes*. As the *qi* rises, swiftly cover the ears with both hands. The ears are the gates of kidney *qi*; one must prevent its leakage outward, ensuring it enters the brain. *"Drink the golden waves in due time"* means that upon sensing the *qi* enter the brain, immediately follow the previous method: nod the head, curve the neck, retract the tongue, and press it against the upper palate. The clear, sweet water that emerges is the sign—sweet as honey. At the *Gen* trigram, fly golden radiance and swallow once, concluding at the *Zhen* trigram. *Qingzhou* corresponds to the *Zhen* trigram; *sunset* to the *Dui* trigram. *"Listen again to the yang song"* refers to restraining the *Yang Pass* from the *Dui* trigram to the *Qian* trigram, using the *Li* trigram daily without gathering medicine.

After drinking all night, fire rises, ascending forward and lifting backward to incinerate the body. Though unbound by years or months, within each day lies heaven and earth. The explanation: This is the method of golden essence refining form. *"After drinking all night, fire rises"* follows the previous method of golden essence returning cinnabar, where refining form at the *Gen* trigram ignites the fire. *"Ascending forward and lifting backward"* refers to flying golden radiance to ignite the fire. During jade essence refining form, first rise backward to guide golden radiance into the crown, then return cinnabar and rise forward to refine form—this distinguishes the method of golden essence refining form. When flying golden radiance ignites fire into the crown, rise forward to refine form. Rising both forward and backward is called *incinerating the body*. When refining cinnabar with fire, adjust the count according to the four seasons. This practice is not bound by years, months, days, or hours; one must be meticulous, single-minded, secluded, and withdrawn. *"Within each day lies heaven and earth"* means that before noon, one refines *Qian*; after noon, one refines *Kun*. From the body’s front and back: the abdomen is *Kun*, the back is *Qian*. *"Refining Qian before noon"* refers to flying golden radiance from behind the elbow and rising forward to refine form. *"Refining Kun after noon"* refers to restraining the *Yang Pass* from the *Dui* trigram to the *Qian* trigram. This method should only be practiced after verifying jade essence returning cinnabar and refining form, with meticulous seclusion, burning incense, and strict adherence.

When refining the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir and subsequently tempering the form by restraining the *Yang Pass*, only after a full year may one proceed to *fenshen* (incineration of the body). *Fenshen* is the refinement of form preceding the *Kan* trigram. Regarding the body’s front and back: the abdomen is *Kun*, the back is *Qian*. For *fenshen*, refine *Qian* before noon and refine *Kun* after noon while restraining the *Yang Pass*. In refining *Qian*, the fire rises from below to above, activating both front and back. In winter and summer, completion occurs in three days; after five days, the method of *jiji* (Completion) is applied to prevent excess, ensuring the Golden Elixir remains supple. This is the ignition of *fenshen* fire within the central throat. Cease only upon verification.

The inner will becomes pure and lofty, merging with the Great Void; the hun and shen spirits do not wander, banishing dreams and sleep. The *Yang* essence solidifies the body, fortifying the spirit’s abode. One becomes impervious to the cold and heat of the four seasons, and one’s countenance naturally transforms. Even when facing ordinary people—though they may be wealthy or noble—one perceives only foul odors, for they remain of mortal bone and vulgar form. When merit and practice are fulfilled, the Three Clarities’ true registers are secretly conferred. The transformations of yin and yang, the fortunes and misfortunes of human affairs, and the movements of spirits—all may be foreknown. The eyes meet only dust and clutter, yet the mind severs all mundane realms. True *qi* fills the body, eliminating the need for food and drink. Extraordinary *qi* emanates a golden hue, and the immortal flesh rivals jade blossoms. Wherever one goes or stays, divine beings appear of their own accord, obeying commands as if by one’s own will.

When true *qi* becomes purely *Yang*, it can dry external water. The above describes the verification of refining form with the Golden Liquor after the Returned Elixir. All that precedes is the secret to longevity and immortality.

**Three Gates of the Great Vehicle for Transcending the Mundane and Entering Sagehood**
**Morning Audience (Eighth)**

**The Golden Proclamation** states:
At the primal division of the singular *qi*, the Great Dao took form and arrayed the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes settled into their positions, the Great Dao acquired names and divided into the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors, each dwelling in distinct lands, guarded their respective directions; the five directions, each governed by distinct *qi*, each guarded one celestial stem. The Azure Emperor’s stems *jia* and *yi* received the nine *qi* of Heaven’s true Wood virtue. The Vermilion Emperor’s stems *bing* and *ding* received the three *qi* of Heaven’s true Fire virtue. The White Emperor’s stems *geng* and *xin* received the seven *qi* of Heaven’s true Metal virtue. The Black Emperor’s stems *ren* and *gui* received the five *qi* of Heaven’s true Water virtue. The Yellow Emperor’s stems *wu* and *ji* received the singular *qi* of Heaven’s true Earth virtue. From the One arises the True One; the True One emerges through Earth, thus all things are born and completed in Earth. The Five Phases are generated and completed in the One. The Dao of the true origin is entirely born of the singular *qi*.

**The Jade Book of Registers** states:
One, three, five, seven, nine—these are the Dao’s divisions manifesting as numbers. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—these are the Dao’s transformations manifesting as images. East, West, South, North, Center—these are the Dao’s arrangements manifesting as positions. Azure, white, vermilion, yellow, black—these are the Dao’s dispersals manifesting as substances. When numbers return to the unnumbered, images revert to the imageless, positions reach the positionless, and substances return to the unsubstantial—then to attain the Dao’s unnumbered state, one must not divide it; to attain the Dao’s imageless state, one must not transform it; to attain the Dao’s positionless state, one must not arrange it; to attain the Dao’s unsubstantial state, one must not solidify it. The unnumbered is the Dao’s source; the imageless is the Dao’s root; the positionless is the Dao’s truth; the unsubstantial is the Dao’s subtlety.

**The True Origin** states:
Once the Dao’s origin divided, it descended from root to branch. Those who awaken to its truth cultivate truth through truth, and when truth is internal, external truth naturally responds. Those who recognize its subtlety attain subtlety through subtlety, and when subtlety is internal, external subtlety naturally responds. Heaven and Earth grasp the Dao’s truth, yet their truth remains unmanifest, thus they have not escaped position. Heaven and Earth grasp the Dao’s subtlety, yet their subtlety remains unmanifest, thus they have not escaped substance. With substance, images may be sought; with position, numbers may be deduced. Within the realm of Heaven and Earth, amid the ten thousand things, none is more noble than humanity. Since Heaven and Earth possess images to be sought, we know their substance, *qi*, and water. Since Heaven and Earth possess numbers to be deduced, we know their positions, far and near. By examining this, we see that the Dao is not distant from humanity.

For analogy: Heaven and Earth have the Five Emperors, just as humans have the five viscera. The Azure Emperor, *jia-yi* Wood—*jia* as Yang, *yi* as Yin—corresponds to the liver’s *qi* and fluids. The Black Emperor, *ren-gui* Water—*ren* as Yang, *gui* as Yin—corresponds to the kidneys’ *qi* and fluids. The Yellow Emperor, *wu-ji* Earth—*wu* as Yang, *ji* as Yin—corresponds to the spleen’s *qi* and fluids. The Vermilion Emperor, *bing-ding* Fire—*bing* as Yang, *ding* as Yin—corresponds to the heart’s *qi* and fluids. The White Emperor, *geng-xin* Metal—*geng* as Yang, *xin* as Yin—corresponds to the lungs’ *qi* and fluids. Though the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter differ, the flourishing of the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys occurs in specific months.

**The True Formula** states:
During the three months of spring, the liver’s *qi* flourishes. When the liver flourishes, the parents’ true *qi*, following the celestial movements, resides in the liver. On Wood days (*jia-yi*), rescue Earth at the hours of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* by kindling the fire to refine the spleen’s *qi*. On other days, during the *dui* trigram hours, diminish Metal to deplete the lungs’ *qi*—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *kan* trigram hours, kindle the fire according to method to refine the kidneys’ *qi*. During the *zhen* trigram hours, enter the chamber, emphasizing inhalation over exhalation as optimal; prolonged breath retention is secondary. Count to one thousand breaths as the measure. At that time, internally visualize according to method, concentrating the mind with closed eyes. Azure light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace. From *yin* to *chen*, fill the *zhen* trigram. Exceeding one thousand breaths is especially excellent. If the breath becomes urgent, gradually reduce it, exhaling and then pausing—do not force continuity.

During the three months of summer, the heart’s *qi* flourishes. When the heart flourishes, the parents’ true *qi*, following the celestial movements, resides in the heart. On Fire days (*bing-ding*), rescue Metal during the *dui* trigram hours by kindling the fire to refine the lungs’ *qi*. On other days, during the *kan* trigram hours, diminish Water to deplete the kidneys’ *qi*—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *zhen* trigram hours, kindle the fire according to method to refine the liver’s *qi*. During the *li* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice breath regulation as before. Vermilion light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace. From *si* to *wei*, fill the *li* trigram. Exceeding one thousand breaths is especially excellent; the method is as described above.

During the three months of autumn, the lungs’ *qi* flourishes. When the lungs flourish, the parents’ true *qi*, following the celestial movements, resides in the lungs. On Metal days (*geng-xin*), rescue Wood during the *zhen* trigram hours by kindling the fire to refine the liver’s *qi*. On other days, during the *li* trigram hours, diminish Fire to deplete the heart’s *qi*—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *xun* trigram hours, kindle the fire according to method to refine the spleen’s *qi*. During the *dui* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice as before. White light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace. From *shen* to *xu*, fill the *dui* trigram.

During the three months of winter, the kidneys’ *qi* flourishes. When the kidneys flourish, the parents’ true *qi*, following the celestial movements, resides in the kidneys. On Water days (*ren-gui*), rescue Fire during the *li* trigram hours by kindling the fire to refine the heart’s *qi*. On other days, during the hours of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, diminish Earth to deplete the spleen’s *qi*—at this time, one must not engage in practice. During the *dui* trigram hours, kindle the fire according to method to refine the lungs’ *qi*. During the *kan* trigram hours, enter the chamber and practice as before. Black light will naturally appear, gradually ascending the body to enter the *niwan* palace. From *hai* to *chou*, fill the *kan* trigram.

Explanation states: In spring, refine the liver for a thousand breaths, and green *qi* emerges. During the final eighteen days of spring, one need not practice as before; instead, adopt the method of settled breathing and sit in stillness throughout the day to nourish the spleen and refine one’s true *qi*. Only then may one kindle the fire during the *kan* trigram hours to refine the kidneys, lest their true *qi* be depleted.

In summer, refine the heart for a thousand breaths, and red *qi* emerges. During the final eighteen days of summer, one need not practice as before; instead, adopt the method of settled breathing and sit in stillness throughout the day, nurturing and refining as before. Only then may one kindle the fire during the *kan* trigram hours as previously described.

In autumn, refine the lungs for a thousand breaths, and white *qi* emerges. During the final eighteen days of autumn, one need not practice as before; instead, adopt the method of settled breathing and sit in stillness throughout the day, nurturing and refining as before. Only then may one kindle the fire during the *kan* trigram hours as previously described.

In winter, refine the kidneys for a thousand breaths, and black *qi* emerges. During the final eighteen days of winter, one need not practice as before; instead, adopt the method of settled breathing and sit in stillness throughout the day, nurturing and refining as before. Only then may one kindle the fire during the *kan* trigram hours as previously described.

When yellow *qi* forms into light, silently observe myriad rays encircling the body.

The method of settled breathing does not lie in forcefully restraining or tightly closing the breath. Rather, it should be continuous as if present, applied without strain, moving from non-being into being, allowing it to reside naturally.

The method of gathering the elixir involves holding the saliva and clasping the hands firmly to prevent the heart’s true *qi* from scattering.

When entering the chamber, one must close the door in a secluded and quiet dwelling, far from chickens, dogs, women, and all disturbing influences. Slightly open a small aperture to discern objects, but ensure neither wind nor sunlight enters, nor any sounds from the left or right.

One should settle the mind and still all thoughts, casting aside worldly concerns. Internally and externally, all must be serene, with nothing to disturb the intent. For the yang spirit is newly gathered and the true *qi* just congealing, one must tend to it as a newborn infant.

Before half the work is complete, burn incense and silently pray to Heaven day and night. Those who conceal themselves in the mountains and forests, with half their merit accomplished, become earthly immortals.

Kneeling and bowing with reverence, silently pray to Heaven, dwelling in remote caves or secluded grottoes. Establish great merit for the world, and remove great harm for the people. Those who remain hidden become heavenly immortals. After three bows are completed, sit in stillness, forgetting all schemes, and proceed with this method.

One must still follow the preceding methods step by step to witness verification. If one merely engages in this practice casually, one may labor in vain and see no fruition, ending only as a ghostly immortal whose yin spirit departs the body.

*The Essential Dao* states: In practicing this method, there is no fixed duration of years, months, or days. Follow the preceding method each month until verification is achieved, and the *qi* will naturally manifest. One must be diligent and unwavering, abandoning all external affairs and focusing the will within the chamber. Discern the proper times and employ two pure yang youths. Alternatively, take on disciples, but beware of betrayal or reversal. After serving for a thousand days, one may complete a single cycle of *qi*. One can overcome ten with one, and in a hundred days, signs of progress will appear. In five hundred days, the *qi* will be complete, allowing one to practice inner observation of *qi* afterward. Gather the yang spirit to merge with celestial spirits, refining it to unite with the Dao, entering sagehood and transcending the mundane.

The verification of refining *qi* lies in feeling the body exceedingly harmonious, often ascending as if in flight, with the elixir’s light penetrating the bones and extraordinary fragrance filling the chamber. Next, in stillness, observe outwardly—purple radiance fills the eyes. Looking downward from the crown, golden light envelops the body. Strange signs and verifications are too numerous to record in full.

This is the ninth method of inner observation.

The *Golden Proclamation* states: The Great Dao is fundamentally formless, residing within *qi*. Its vastness knows no bounds, and no thing can contain it. The Great Dao is fundamentally functionless, yet operates through things. Its depth is unfathomable, and no principle can exhaust it. Speaking of the Dao in terms of its body, it then begins to have distinctions of inner and outer. Speaking of the Dao in terms of its function, it then begins to have a basis for observation and perception. Observe inwardly and not outwardly, and though nothing external remains unexamined, clarity is attained within. Observe the spirit and not the form, and though no form is left unprepared, the spirit becomes visible.

The *True Origin* states: With one mind observe the myriad things, and the myriad things are not said to be in excess. With the myriad things disturbing the one *qi*, the one *qi* is not said to be insufficient. When the one *qi* returns to the mind, the mind cannot be seized by things. When the one mind moves the one *qi*, the *qi* cannot be enslaved by methods. When the source of the mind is clear and penetrating, one illumination shatters ten thousand delusions, and one is unaware of the existence of things. When *qi* wages a fierce struggle, ten thousand sensations are stilled in a single breath, and one is unaware of the existence of methods. Things are no-things, returning to the original image. Methods are no-methods, thereby fulfilling the true nature of self-attainment.

For analogy: form arises from image, and names are established from form. With names, one infers their numbers; with numbers, one grasps their principles. Such is the discourse of analogy. Yet the supreme and void Dao transcends all things, and nothing can serve as a comparison. What can be likened is this: as in human cultivation, the seasons and sequences are without error, and accomplishments follow in order. The harmonious *qi* congeals without dispersing; the true nature, utterly serene, is without action. The spirit merges with the Dao and returns to spontaneity. At this juncture, take non-mind as mind. How then is one to respond to things? Take non-things as things. How then is one to employ methods? In true joy, one is blissfully unaware of having a body. Gradually entering the Dao of non-action, one reaches the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, becoming a guest who has entered sagehood and transcended the mundane.

The *True Formula* states: This method accords with the Dao, resembling the principle of visualization often discussed, or like the moment when Chan monks enter samadhi. Choose an auspicious site to establish a chamber. Kneel, pay respects, burn incense, sit upright with legs crossed, let the hair down, loosen the robes, clench the fists to retain spirit, empty the mind, and close the eyes. Before noon, slightly raise the body to kindle the fire and refine *qi*. After noon, slightly gather the body to concentrate the fire and burn the elixir. Regardless of day or night, when the spirit is clear and *qi* harmonious, one naturally delights in sitting. During sitting, if sounds are heard, do not listen; if visions appear, do not acknowledge them, and the illusory realms will disperse of themselves. If one acknowledges the illusory realms, demonic forces will intensify and not retreat. Immediately, slightly gather the body, then stretch the waist; afterward, slightly recline the chest without stretching the waist. Wait briefly until the fire rises before and behind, then raise the body without moving—this is called "firing the body." When the fire rises, demonic forces scatter beyond the body, and yin evil does not enter the shell. Repeat this two or three times. Then visualize all between heaven and earth as a raging fire, entirely cool and devoid of things. Only then may one see carriages, horses, singing, dancing, canopies, silks, wealth, splendor, and joyous multitudes—processions in rows, five-colored clouds ascending, as if ascending to the celestial realms. Upon arriving there, one sees towering pavilions of jade green, courtyards stretching endlessly, pearls, jewels, gold, and jade scattered ungathered upon the ground, flowers, fruits, ponds, and pavilions beyond count. Suddenly, exotic fragrances arise on all sides, and the sounds of music and revelry fill the air. Guests and friends sit in full assembly, with delicacies of land and sea laid out. Laughter and conversation abound, celebrating great peace, and precious objects are exchanged as gifts. At this moment, though these are not yin ghosts or demonic forces, one must not regard them as auspicious. The true cultivator renounces external affairs, willingly endures solitude, conceals traces in rivers and lakes, or withdraws to secluded corners, cutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions, ever vigilant in conduct, enduring hardship and enjoying freedom. Once the work is accomplished and the method established, one may suddenly witness such splendor. Though not considering it a demonic illusion, one might mistake it for a true arrival in the celestial palace. Little does one know that the transcending of the mortal womb occurs within one’s own celestial palace atop the head. If one becomes attached and takes it for reality, failing to employ the method of transcendence, the yang spirit will remain within the body, and the embryonic immortal will not transform. One may then claim to have emerged above the dark paths, becoming an earthbound immortal, achieving longevity without death—but one cannot shed the mortal form to ascend as an immortal and return to the Three Isles as a celestial being. This is truly lamentable. Disciples must consider that though transcendence is difficult, it cannot be neglected.

The *Essentials of the Dao* states: The inexhaustible Dharma has already extinguished past faults.

**Transcendence: Tenth Method**

The *Golden Proclamation* states: The Dao is fundamentally non-being; to speak of it as being is not the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally void; to speak of it as substantial is not the Dao. Being formless, even questions and responses cannot apply to it. Being imageless, even seeing and hearing cannot apply to it. Taking the mysterious and subtle as the Dao, the mysterious and subtle still cannot escape the burdens of inquiry and perception. Taking the subtle and imperceptible as the Dao, one still cannot avoid the burdens of seeing and hearing. If even the subtle and imperceptible are not the Dao, then the Dao is also beyond knowing how it is so.

The *Jade Scripture* states: Its coming has a beginning, yet one does not know the beginning of the Great Dao. What is this? Its going has an end, yet one does not know the end of the Great Dao. What is this? Above the loftiest heights, though there is an "above," one does not know that above the Great Dao there is no limit. Below the deepest depths, though there is a "below," one does not know that below the Great Dao there is no end. Profound and unfathomable, it is called the Dao. It accords with what beings attain and arranges distinctions. The Dao of non-action cannot be exhausted.

The *True Formula* states: "Transcend" means transcending the mortal body to enter the ranks of sages. "Liberate" means shedding the mundane womb to become an immortal child.

When the spirit enters the qi-womb, the qi is complete in the true formula. Only when prior merits manifest verification at every stage may one dwell in a chamber of purity to enter the realm of the subtle and formless. There, one inwardly observes and recognizes the yang-spirit, then kindles the fire to subdue demons, burning the body to gather qi. The true qi ascends to the celestial palace, and within the shell, all is emptiness—nothing remains. Where to choose a secluded abode? Simply follow the practice of inward contemplation.

After the three bows are completed, sit upright without rising or adjusting posture, close the eyes, and still the mind. When stillness reaches its utmost and the primordial is invoked, the body seems suspended in space, the spirit and qi drifting freely, difficult to restrain. In silent inward contemplation, clarity shines unobscured: mountains and rivers appear resplendent, pavilions and towers faintly discernible. Purple qi and crimson light swirl in formation, auspicious simurghs and rainbow-feathered phoenixes sing with flute-like voices. Amidst such wondrous splendor—truly the delight of the alchemical crucible, a separate realm within the grotto-heaven—one roams carefree, oblivious to the burdens of the dusty world.

At this moment of true emptiness, the qi turns of itself, without need for method or adherence to time. If a blue-green qi emerges from the east, accompanied by the resonant strains of reed pipes and the procession of banners, chariots, and attendants—uncountable in number—before long, a crimson qi appears from the south, a white qi from the west, a black qi from the north, and a yellow qi from the center. The five qi converge to form radiant clouds, the air filled with joyous music and exuberant harmony. Golden lads and jade maidens escort one’s form, now riding a fiery dragon, now mounting a dark crane, now astride a rainbow phoenix, now bestriding a fierce tiger. Ascending into the void, rising from below, one traverses realms where towers and temples defy description, and divine officials and spirits surpass enumeration.

Arriving at another place, ten thousand rows of female musicians stand in array, officials ranked in order, like the court of an earthly emperor, with sages and worthies all in attendance. At this time, one remains unmoved by all around, ascending further until reaching a gate where guards stand solemn and inviolable. The officials and musicians linger behind, unable to follow, and as one passes through, a canopy veils the face. Descending once more, one returns to the former dwelling. Such ascent and descent occur countless times—this is the method of adjusting the spirit’s emergence from the shell.

With days of accumulated practice, one ascends directly to the celestial palace and descends back to the original place, moving freely without obstruction. The ascent begins from below, like climbing a seven-tiered pagoda or ascending a three-story crimson tower. At first, one ascends step by step, and upon reaching the seventh level, one must not look down, for the spirit, startled, clings to the body and refuses to depart. Only after reaching the summit may one leap with eyes closed, as if in dream or waking. A body exists outside the body, its form like an infant’s, skin fresh and radiant, spirit luminous. Looking back at the former shell, one sees nothing—only a heap of filth, a withered tree—shame and remorse arise, yet it cannot be abandoned at once for distant wandering.

For the spirit’s emergence is not yet perfected, and the sagely qi has not fully coalesced. One must re-enter the original body, mastering the art of coming and going until effortless. At first, one may wander but a step or two, then two or three *li*, and with accumulated practice, like a stalwart warrior, one may stretch an arm to traverse a thousand or ten thousand *li*. The spirit grows mighty, the form robust, and courage unshakable. Then one may entrust the mortal frame to the mountains and rivers, dwelling beyond the world’s responses, no longer mingling with the vulgar.

Thus, when merits are fulfilled, one receives the celestial writ, riding simurghs and phoenixes, straddling tigers and dragons, journeying east and west to enter the Purple Court. First, one meets the True Lord of the Grand Tenuity, then resides on the lower isles. To ascend to the grotto-heaven, one must transmit the Dao and accumulate merit among mortals. Receiving the celestial writ, one ascends to the grotto-heaven as a celestial immortal.

Few in ancient or modern times have succeeded in this practice, for many seek swift progress before merits are complete, or attempt transcendence through mere quiet sitting before verification is attained. Some, with lingering yin-spirits, emerge as ghost-immortals, unseen in form, wandering without destination, only to seize mortal shells and become human immortals. Others, unskilled in coming and going, lose the way back to their original body, their spirit adrift—this is the "sitting transformation" of Buddhist monks or the "corpse-liberation" of Daoist adepts.

Therefore, this practice demands that prior merits be verified at every stage. One must choose a site and construct a chamber, far from all foul odors, putrid vapors, worldly noises, and the allure of women, lest they disturb the true qi or repulse the spirit. If one emerges and re-enters, enters and does not emerge, then form and spirit attain perfection, enduring as long as heaven and earth, undying through eons. If one emerges and does not re-enter, like a cicada shedding its husk, the spirit ascends to sageliness—transcending the mortal and shedding the vulgar to become a true immortal, dwelling beyond the dusty world on the isles of the Three Mountains.

The above is the secret of transcending the mortal to enter sageliness.
The Great Vehicle’s Three Gates pertain to celestial immortals.
