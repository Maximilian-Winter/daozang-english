**Chart of the Three Powers’ Fixed Positions**

**Chapter Titles of the *Chart of the Three Powers’ Fixed Positions***

Presented by Zhang Shangying, Grand Master for Thorough Service, Guardian of the Right Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, Concurrently Palace Attendant of the Secretariat, Grand Pillar of the State, Duke of the Principality of Qinghe, with a fief of 2,900 households and an actual enfeoffment of 900 households.

**Upper Chapter**
The *Spiritual Pivot* states: The summit of Kunlun Mountain is called Jade Capital Mountain. The Jade Capital Heavenly Thearch rules as the One of Heaven, surrounded by thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs in the four directions—altogether thirty-three Thearchs, which the Grand Historian referred to as the concealment of the sun and moon to form day and night.

The palace where the Jade Capital Heavenly Thearch resides, the *Biography of the Brilliant Sage* calls the Hall of Pervading Radiance, where the Thearch’s bodily light and the hall’s light illuminate each other.

The *Spiritual Pivot* states: Above the Jade Capital Heaven are the Three Pure Heavens.
The Grand Clarity Heaven, also called the Great Scarlet Heaven.
*Liezi* also says: "Looking up, one sees neither sun nor moon; looking down, one sees neither rivers nor seas." This describes this heaven.

The Highest Clarity Heaven, also called the Yu-Yu Heaven.
The Jade Clarity Heaven, also called the Qingwei Heaven. Here, the Nine August Ones descend with *qi*, initiating yin and yang, manifesting divine transformations, and bestowing joy upon self and others—this is this heaven.

The Heaven of the Void Thearch: This is where the True Nine August Ones descend with *qi* from above, and the wind below moistens the marsh to create the world. As *qi* possesses yin and yang, so people possess male and female, which the *Cavern Scripture* calls Jade Lads and Jade Maidens. This is why I have arranged the Three Pure Heavens as follows: Jade Clarity as the Qingwei Heaven, Highest Clarity as the Yu-Yu Heaven, and Grand Clarity as the Great Scarlet Heaven.

**Lower Chapter**
The eight trigrams of the *Book of Changes* originate from the *qi* of the True Nine August Ones. Pure yang is *Qian*, residing in the northwest; pure yin is *Kun*, residing in the southwest. When the yang of *Qian* descends and seizes the yin within *Kun*, the center of *Kan* becomes solid and forms the moon. When the yin of *Kun* ascends and seizes the yang within *Qian*, the center of *Li* becomes hollow and forms the sun.

The moon receives the *qi* of the sun and moves through the twelve earthly branches. At the new moon, it is the body of *Kun*; at the full moon, it is the body of *Qian*. From the third to the seventh day, it emerges at *Geng* as *Zhen*; from the eighth to the twelfth day, it emerges at *Ding* as *Dui*; from the thirteenth to the seventeenth day, it emerges at *Jia* as *Qian*; from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day, it emerges at *Xin* as *Xun*; from the twenty-third to the twenty-seventh day, it emerges at *Wu* as *Gen*; from the twenty-eighth to the second day, it sets at *Yi* as *Kun*. Thus, five days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, and the divisions of solstices, equinoxes, beginnings, and closings are thereby precise to the finest measure.

Among the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, *Li* is fire and lightning, *Kan* is water and clouds, yet they do not represent the sun and moon. For the sun and moon transform *Qian*, *Kun*, *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Gen*, and *Xun* to complete the years, months, days, and hours. If they were confined to the images, their transformations would be hindered. The Han Confucians’ designation of the four cardinal trigrams as the lords of the directions and the six children as the functions of *Qian* and *Kun* are all conjectural theories.

The Three August Ones, the Five Thearchs, and Confucius used this to exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and attain destiny. If one does not unite with the spirit but relies on intellect, is this not what is meant by "beyond this, there is nothing to be known"?

The Eight Trigrams Descend in Darkness
The Dao speaks: Prior to the Supreme Unity, its form was spontaneous.

The Supreme Unity is the primordial qi of the Original One, first born within the Great Void. It resides within the boundless and infinite, dwelling at the inception of formlessness and imagelessness—hence it is called the Supreme Unity. Above is wind, below is water; these two qi intermingle and settle. Above the Great Void lies the Heaven of Jade Capital, which is Jade Capital Mountain. The "contained lotus" refers to the qi of the Six Origins, which, moved by the numinous spirits of the Nine August Celestial Perfected, descend to divide the semblance of primordial chaos. At the first flourishing, transformation begins, and the uncarved simplicity arranges itself into the wheel of wind and water; at the second flourishing, the qi intermingle and settle.

Above Jade Capital, to the east, south, west, and north, lie eight heavens each—thirty-two heavens in total, with one hundred and twenty-two Thearchs. Above Jade Capital lies the Three Clarities Heaven, which comprises the Heaven of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Heaven of Highest Clarity’s Perfected Realm, and the Heaven of Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Realm. Above the Three Clarities Heaven lie the Ten Heavens of the Void August, wherein dwell the Void August Primordial Elders, Void August Primordial Lords, Void August Primordial Thearchs, Void August Primordial Venerables, and the Celestial Perfected Nine August Realized Ones.

The Celestial Perfected August Ones descend the Nine Flourishings of Celestial Perfection, dividing the Six Origins to form the semblance of primordial chaos. Lesser Yang corresponds to Qian, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the first flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within water, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, red; below, black; left, azure; right, white; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this qi. Lesser Yin corresponds to Xun, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the second flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within wind, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, black; below, red; left, white; right, azure; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this flourishing.

Greater Yin corresponds to Kan, its emblem being the virtue of water reversing fire; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the third flourishing of the Water Virtue Fire Perfected, born within water, its form like an embraced egg. Greater Yang corresponds to Li, its emblem being the virtue of fire reversing water; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fourth flourishing of the Fire Virtue Water Perfected, born within wind, its form like an embraced egg. Yang Brightness corresponds to Zhen, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fifth flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within water, its form like a contained lotus. Greater Yin corresponds to Dui, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the sixth flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within wind, its form like a contained lotus.

The Three Yangs converge at Gen, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the seventh flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to be born in the upper expanse. It scatters and transforms into heaven—thus pure yang becomes heaven, while the remaining flourishings scatter and transform into the sun, moon, and stars. The Three Yins converge at Kun, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the eighth flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to open below. It scatters and transforms into earth—thus turbid yin becomes earth, while the remaining flourishings fuse and congeal into mountains, rivers, metals, and stones, thereby manifesting the true Dao of spontaneity.
