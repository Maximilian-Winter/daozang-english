**Secret Transmission of Embryonic Breathing: Five Gates**
1. *Natural Embryonic Breathing Formula*: Practicing this enables one to shed the mortal husk and ascend as an immortal.
2. *True Embryonic Breathing Formula*: Practicing this grants longevity and deathlessness, with clarity in departure and abiding.
3. *Great Embryonic Breathing Formula*: Practicing this brings peace, extends years, reverses aging, and strengthens bones while lightening the body.
4. *Chaos-Origin Embryonic Breathing Formula*: Practicing this reverses aging, transforming the skin to jade-like smoothness.
5. *Embryonic Breathing Formula*: Practicing this merely dispels illness and nourishes the skin.

The above embryonic breathing formulas each align with the proper timing and correspond to the Five Phases. Within non-action, there is action. They do not rely on visualization or guided movement, nor do they require avoidance of taboos. Practiced for ten days, their effects manifest. The profound mechanisms and subtle principles are too vast to fully expound!

**True Dragon-Tiger Conjugation Internal Elixir Diagram**
The essence of the heart conceals the true yang qi, called the *Yang Dragon*.
The qi of the kidneys bears the true unified water, called the *Yin Tiger*.

**Secret Transmission of Internal Elixir: Seven Gates**
1. *Purple Gold Elixir Formula*: Gathering the dragon-tiger internal elixir, with six hundred days of firing completed, and the water-fire balance perfected—this is called the *Purple Gold Elixir*. Once achieved, one may ascend.
2. *Gold Elixir Formula*: Gathering the dragon-tiger to form the internal elixir, then refining it with the golden liquid returning elixir to complete the gold elixir firing—six hundred days fully accomplished—one may attain deathlessness.
3. *Dragon-Tiger Internal Elixir Formula*: Refining to complete the firing in just three hundred days, one may achieve longevity.
4. *Azure Gold Elixir Formula*: Refining the true qi of the liver to completion.
5. *Crimson Gold Elixir Formula*: Refining the true qi of the heart to completion.
6. *Western Florescence Elixir Formula*: Refining the true qi of the lungs to completion.
7. *Supreme Mystery Elixir Formula*: Refining the true qi of the kidneys to completion.

The above internal elixir formulas operate within non-action yet contain action, without reliance on visualization or guided movement.
- When the *Purple Gold Elixir* is achieved, one sheds the husk and ascends as an immortal.
- When the *Gold Elixir* is achieved, one becomes a terrestrial spirit.
- When the *Dragon-Tiger Elixir* is achieved, one attains longevity and deathlessness.
- The remaining elixirs can reverse aging.
- Gathering them may take a single day to complete, not years or decades.
- A person with the elixir is like a dragon with a pearl—ascending and soaring freely, the power of the elixir.

**Circulating Heaven Fire Timing Diagram**
**Secret Transmission of Fire Timing: Five Gates, totaling six hundred chapters**
1. *Circulating Heaven Hourly Fire*: The first fire timing. One hour seizes a year’s firing work.
2. *Circulating Heaven Daily Fire*: The second fire timing. One day seizes a year’s firing work.
3. *Circulating Heaven Monthly Fire*: The third fire timing. One month seizes a year’s firing work.
4. *Circulating Heaven Qi Fire*: The fourth fire timing. One qi cycle seizes a year’s firing work.
5. *Circulating Heaven Fire Timing*: The fifth fire timing. One year’s natural count completes one year’s work.

The above fire timings:
- Refining form strengthens bones and lightens the body.
- Refining essence reverses aging and restores youth.
- Refining qi unites with the yang spirit.
- Refining spirit returns to the true and enters the Dao.
The numbers of fire timings are profound and inexhaustible; the methods of firing are unpredictable in practice.

**Elbow-Behind Flying Gold Essence Diagram**
**Secret Transmission of Elbow-Behind Guard: Three Gates**
1. *Elbow-Behind Flying Gold Essence Formula*: Using the true qi of the lungs to form the daily gold essence, striking through the three passes to directly enter the *Niwan* (Mud Pill Palace). When the marrow is full, the bones strengthen, naturally reversing aging. After the dragon-tiger internal elixir is formed, the kidney qi must subtly bear the true qi of the lungs, drawing it to the crown and combining it with the divine water to descend.
2. *Elbow-Behind Technique Formula*: This uses the kidney qi to subtly bear the true qi of the lungs, passing only through the three passes to replenish the *Niwan*. It restores black hair and smooths wrinkled skin.
3. *Returning Essence to Replenish the Brain Formula*: While guarding internally, one may still encounter external stimuli. Thus, one must regulate and refine to prevent leakage, returning essence to replenish the brain and attain longevity and deathlessness.

The above elbow-behind techniques prevent the kidney qi from transmitting to the five viscera. Instead, it passes behind the *Weilü* (Tail Gate) lower pass, then through the *Jiaji* (Spine Flank) middle pass, and finally enters the *Yujing* (Jade Capital) upper pass to fill the sea of marrow.
For those cultivating the true who gather the dragon-tiger and form the true elixir embryo in a single day, this technique must be practiced to draw out the yin lead afterward, thereby swiftly attaining pure yang. If one fails to awaken to the true Dao and does not recognize the dragon-tiger conjugation but merely seeks to reverse aging, practicing this guard will yield results before stopping.

**Returning Elixir Diagram**
From the *Weilü* (Tail Gate) pass, striking through the three passes to reach the *Niwan*, harmonizing with the divine water to descend and return to the elixir field—this is called the *Great Returning Elixir*.
From the kidneys transmitting to the liver, the liver to the heart, the heart to the spleen, the spleen to the lungs, and circulating back to the elixir field—this is called the *Lesser Returning Elixir*.

**Secret Transmission of Returning Elixir: Six Gates**
1. *Nine Cycles Returning Elixir Formula*: Using the true qi of the five viscera and the field’s true qi, harmonizing with the divine water to descend into the elixir field—this is called the *Nine Cycles*. Once accomplished, one may immediately shed the husk and ascend as an immortal.
2. *Seven Returns Elixir Formula*: With three yin and three yang, three returns, circulating day and night once through the three fields—this is called the *Seven Returns*. Once accomplished, one may immediately shed the husk and ascend as an immortal.
3. *Great Returning Elixir Formula*: With the three fields circulating once in return—this is called the *Great Returning Elixir*. Once achieved, one not only attains longevity in the world but may also ascend with the mortal bones, becoming a feathered transcendent.

**Lesser Returning Elixir Formula***: With the five viscera circulating once—this is called the *Lesser Returning Elixir*. Once accomplished, one not only attains peace and longevity but may also achieve long life and reverse aging.

**Golden Liquid Returning Elixir Formula***: Using the true qi of the lungs combined with the divine water in the crown, called the *Golden Liquid*, descending to return to the mother field—this naturally transforms the bones to a golden hue, and the body radiates golden light.

**Jade Liquid Returning Elixir Formula***: Using the true qi of the kidneys combined with the divine water in the heart, called the *Jade Liquid*, descending to return to the elixir field—this naturally refines the blood into essence, and the body becomes like a jade tree.

The above Returning Elixir formulas involve issuing forth and then returning to the original place—hence the name *Returning Elixir*. They are not mere rinsing of saliva or swallowing of spittle. For one without an inner elixir, the Returning Elixir can still transform the skin and alter one’s appearance. For one with an inner elixir, the Returning Elixir irrigates the true qi, hastening the attainment of pure yang. From the crown, it descends into the Yellow Court.

As the scripture states: *The Golden Liquid Returning Elixir returns from the kidneys to the Yellow Court—this is called the Jade Liquid Returning Elixir!*

**Illustrated Secret Methods for Refining the Form**

**Secret Transmission of Refining the Form Methods** (Four Gates):

1. **Solar Refining of the Form Formula***: With an inner elixir, using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the form—after a hundred days, one may naturally ascend and fly.

2. **Lunar Refining of the Form Formula***: Using the true divine water in the crown to refine the form—after a hundred days, the blood transforms into essence; after a thousand days, the flesh transforms into qi.

3. **Golden Liquid Refining of the Form Formula***: Using the true qi of the lungs combined with divine water, at the moment before the elixir returns, ascending to refine the body—one’s appearance becomes like a jade tree, and golden flowers appear before the eyes.

4. **Jade Liquid Refining of the Form Formula***: Using the true qi of the kidneys to circulate through the five viscera, at the moment before the elixir returns, ascending and entering the four limbs—transforming the blood into essence, the skin like a jade tree, and the refined essence like jade, rendering one impervious to cold and heat.

This not only irrigates the elixir field and dissolves the sovereign fire but also steams the five viscera, aiding the generation of qi.

The above four methods for refining the form are fundamentally the same. Since ancient times, perfected beings have not wished to remain in the world with their forms but have preferred to shed the husk and become true persons. Yet refining the form also has its methods—it is simply that few attain them.

**Illustrated Methods for the Three Fields’ Mutual Accomplishment**

**Secret Transmission of Mutual Accomplishment Methods** (Two Gates):

1. **Mutual Accomplishment Formula***: With the qi of the kidneys subtly carrying the true qi of the lungs, both fly down the Pass, ascending to replenish the Mud Pill Palace. Once the Sea of Marrow is full, employing the method to harmonize with divine water and descend to return to the elixir field. Then, using the pure yang qi within the elixir to ascend—one ascent and one descent meeting beside the Double Towers—this is called *Mutual Accomplishment*. Each Mutual Accomplishment yields one grain of golden millet Returning Elixir. One grain of golden millet Returning Elixir produces one beam of golden light, emerging from between the skin and hair. With myriad beams of golden light, one may naturally shed the husk and ascend as an immortal.

2. **Lesser Mutual Accomplishment Formula***: Using the fire kindled from the Returning Elixir—this is called *Lesser Mutual Accomplishment*. Each Lesser Mutual Accomplishment enables one to refine the form and remain in the world, forever impervious to cold and heat.

The above Mutual Accomplishment methods are not the rinsing and swallowing of saliva, nor the sending of intention to the lower field, nor the visualization of heart fire raising the intention to the Double Towers to meet the descending divine water—where the taste is sweet and the spirit refreshed. Naturally, when the true fire ascends, the body grows warm and the qi clear, rising of its own accord. The profound mechanism and wondrous subtleties are difficult to express in writing.

**Illustrated Methods for Refining Qi into Spirit and Audience at the Origin**

**Secret Transmission of Refining Qi into Spirit and Audience at the Origin Methods** (Six Gates):

1. **Refining Qi into Spirit and Audience at the Origin Formula***: Using the true qi within the elixir to refine the qi of the five viscera, ascending to become spirit and entering the Heavenly Palace.

2. **Three Flowers Audience at the Origin Formula***: The pure yang within the elixir—one flower ascends to audience at the Heavenly Palace; the true yang within the heart—one flower ascends to audience at the Heavenly Palace; the correct yang within the kidneys—one flower ascends to audience at the Heavenly Palace.

3. **Refining Liver Qi into Spirit Formula***: Using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the liver—enabling one to see ghosts and spirits with the eyes.

4. **Refining Heart Qi into Spirit Formula***: Using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the heart—enabling one to know past events.

5. **Refining Lung Qi into Spirit Formula***: Using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the lungs—enabling one to be forever impervious to cold and heat.

6. **Refining Kidney Qi into Spirit Formula***: Using the pure yang qi within the elixir to refine the kidneys—enabling one to reverse aging and return to youth.

The above methods for refining qi require the presence of an elixir to refine the qi. When the qi is true, the spirit manifests of itself; when the spirit manifests, the Dao is naturally attained! If one merely visualizes with the heart fire, it is futile—like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. The profound subtleties are difficult to expound.

**Illustrated Methods for Internal Visualization and Kindling the Fire, Exchanging Mortal for Immortal**

**Secret Transmission of Internal Visualization and Kindling the Fire Methods** (Seven Gates):

Internal visualization and kindling the fire to expel the Three Corpses,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to expel the Seven Po,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to subdue the myriad demons,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to slay the Five Ghosts,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to descend the Nine Worms,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to eliminate illnesses,
Internal visualization and kindling the fire to refine the form and substance.

Also called *Burning the Body*.

The above methods for kindling the fire require the presence of an inner elixir to ignite the pure yang qi within the elixir—this is called the *true and correct fire*. If one takes the heart as the sovereign fire, the kidneys as the ministerial fire, and the bladder as the popular fire—this is called the *Threefold Samādhi True Fire*. Though called true fire, it is dim and unclear, not the internal visualization and kindling of fire from the inner elixir.

When the inner elixir kindles the fire, ghosts and spirits dare not approach, and water and fire cannot harm. One sees it oneself—flames blazing ten thousand zhang within the fire!

**Illustrated Methods for Shedding the Husk, Ascending as an Immortal, Entering Sagehood, and Transcending the Mortal**

**Secret Transmission of Shedding the Husk Methods** (Twelve Gates):

When Master Zhongli achieved the Dao, he emerged from a seven-tiered pagoda;
When Master Lü achieved the Dao, he emerged from a three-story red tower;
When Master Haichan achieved the Dao, he emerged as a crane soaring through the Heavenly Gate;

When the Yellow Emperor achieved the Dao, he emerged upon a fire dragon;
When Perfected Master Shi achieved the Dao, he emerged from a forest of blossoms.

There are also those who depart by gazing at the moon and riding forth, or by the earth surging with five-colored clouds—these are not recorded here. For whether a Buddhist monk sits in transformation or a Daoist attains *shijie* (corpse liberation), if they have not first cultivated foundational work, and if their shedding of the husk arises from fixed concentration rather than spontaneous awakening at the Heavenly Gate, they become *guixian* (ghost immortals), not true *chunyang* (pure yang) immortals.

In truth, they are ghosts—refined and numinous ghosts, not pure yang immortals.
