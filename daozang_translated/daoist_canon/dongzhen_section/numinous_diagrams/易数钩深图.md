**Preface to the *Yi Shu Gou Yin Tu***

By Liu Mu of Sanqu

The *Yi* speaks of the intermingling of yin and yang qi. When yin and yang have yet to intermingle, the Four Images remain unestablished; when the Eight Trigrams remain undivided, how can the myriad things come into being? Thus, the Two Modes transform and generate the Four Images, the Four Images transform and generate the Eight Trigrams, and the Eight Trigrams double to form the sixty-four hexagrams—herein lies the consummation of all affairs under heaven.

The hexagrams were established by the sages to observe their images. Images are the responses of formless reality. Tracing their root, form arises from image, and image is established through number. Without number, there would be no means to perceive the origin of the Four Images. Thus, when Confucius expounded upon the *Yi*, he necessarily invoked the utmost numbers of heaven and earth to elucidate the Dao of accomplishing transformation and enacting the way of spirits and gods. From this, we know that the *Yi* as a text must exhaust numbers to comprehend its foundation.

Examining the commentarial traditions, though they excel in dividing the classics and analyzing their meanings with marvelous precision, when it comes to explaining the intricate numbers of heaven and earth, their words remain overly concise, failing to align with the *Appended Judgments*. This is why scholars find their meanings difficult to grasp. Here, I have gathered the odd and even numbers of heaven and earth, from the Supreme Ultimate generating the Two Modes down to the *Fu* Hexagram, totaling fifty-five positions, and marked them into charts. Beneath each chart, I have provided explanations of their meanings, so that those who peruse them may find clarity.

The Dao of the *Yi* is profound and distant; even the sages of old struggled to fathom its ultimate traces. As for myself, a humble student who follows in their footsteps, I am indeed cowed by my own reckless presumption. Yet the images have fixed positions, and transformations have fixed numbers—one cannot recklessly force interpretations upon them. May the learned and refined gentlemen examine this work in detail.

*Yi Shu Gou Yin Tu, Juan One*

**The Supreme Ultimate, First**
The Supreme Ultimate has no number or image. Here, I depict the qi of the Two Modes merged as one, intending to clarify their origin.

**The Supreme Ultimate Generates the Two Modes, Second**
The *Classic* states: *"The* Yi *has the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes."* The Supreme Ultimate is a single qi. Before heaven and earth divided, primordial qi was blended as one; when this qi split, it became the Two Modes. The *Yi* speaks not of "heaven and earth" but of "Two Modes"—why? Because the Two Modes mark the first division of the two qi, whereas "heaven and earth" denote their manifest forms. As they are the initial division of the two bodies, they are called the Two Modes.

How to demonstrate this? Briefly: the qi above is light and pure; the qi below is heavy and turbid. The light and pure, being round, form heaven’s image; the heavy and turbid, being square, form earth’s image. At this stage, when above and below have yet to interact, only their modes are distinguished. When the two qi interact, heaven descends once to generate water, and earth ascends twice to generate fire—this is the beginning of form. Once the Five Phases are complete, they give rise to the animate and inanimate, as it is said: *"In heaven they form images; on earth they form shapes."* Thus, the Two Modes are the images of heaven and earth, while heaven and earth are the substances of the Two Modes.

Here, heaven is drawn rotating left, taking the positions of heaven-one and heaven-three. Earth is drawn moving right, taking the positions of earth-two and earth-four. Their separation into distinct places clarifies the image of above and below before interaction.

**Heaven-Five, Third**
Heaven-one, earth-two, heaven-three, and earth-four are the generating numbers of the Four Images. As for heaven-five, it resides at the center, presiding over transformation—no one knows what it truly is. It is forcibly named the qi of central harmony, for it is so of itself, without cause. It intermingles with the qi of heaven and earth, completing the substance of the Five Phases, pervading and interweaving all without omission. Once the Dao of the Three Powers is complete, it withdraws into concealment, quiescent and inactive—this is what is meant by *"the unfathomable workings of yin and yang as spirit."*

Though the *Classic* states that the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams, it requires the transformations of three and five, fulfilling the completing numbers of seven, eight, nine, and six, before the Eight Trigrams can be generated and their positions fixed.

**The Number Fifteen of Heaven and Earth, Fourth**
Someone may ask: *Why does the number of heaven and earth derive its transformations from heaven-five?*

Answer: The generating numbers of heaven and earth are sufficient to produce transformation. The number of heaven and earth is fifteen, from heaven-one to heaven-five, totaling fifteen numbers. Heaven-one, heaven-three, and heaven-five sum to nine—this is the number of yang, hence *"The* Qian *origin employs nine."* Earth-two and earth-four sum to six—this is the number of yin, hence *"The* Kun *origin employs six."* Including the completing numbers of the Five Phases, forty, the total is fifty-five, the ultimate number of heaven and earth, by which transformations are accomplished and the workings of ghosts and spirits are enacted.

**Heaven-One Descends to Generate Earth-Six, Fifth**
**Earth-Two Ascends to Generate Heaven-Seven, Sixth**
**Heaven-Three Moves Left to Generate Earth-Eight, Seventh**
**Earth-Four Moves Right to Generate Heaven-Nine, Eighth**
The *Classic* states: *"Combine and arrange them to vary, interweave their numbers. Through their variations, the patterns of heaven and earth are completed; by exhausting their numbers, the images of the world are fixed."*

Explanation: *"Combine"* means to unite; *"arrange"* means to pair. For example, heaven-five unites with heaven-one, descending to generate earth-six. By communicating their variations and interweaving them, the numbers of the Four Images and Eight Trigrams are formed. *"Completing the patterns of heaven and earth"* refers to the manifest patterns when yin and yang interact. *"Exhausting their numbers"* means exhausting the numbers of heaven and earth—the ultimate number being fifty-five. *"Fixing the images of heaven and earth"* means that once the numbers of heaven and earth are established, the images follow and are fixed.

**The Two Modes Generate the Four Images, Ninth**
The *Classic* states: *"The Two Modes generate the Four Images."* Kong’s *Subcommentary* says: *"Metal, wood, water, and fire receive their existence from heaven and earth, hence it is said the Two Modes generate the Four Images."* Earth, however, rules in the four seasons and is a distinct element within the earth—thus only the Four Images are mentioned. Yet metal, wood, water, and fire are tangible things; how can they be called "images"? Kong’s interpretation is far off the mark.

It is also said: *"The* Yi *has Four Images to demonstrate."* Zhuang states: *"The Four Images refer to the sixty-four hexagrams, which contain real images, borrowed images, images of meaning, and images of function."* This has already been refuted in the section on hexagram interpretation.

He [He Xinyin] says: *"Heaven generates numinous things, which the sage models—first; heaven and earth transform, which the sage emulates—second; heaven displays images to reveal fortune and misfortune—third; the Yellow River yields the Diagram, the Luo River yields the Writing, which the sage models—fourth."* These four matters, I contend, are separate achievements of the sage outside the *Yi*, not exclusively within it. To say *"the* Yi *has Four Images"* and then add *"the* Yi *has Four Images to demonstrate"* alongside *"the* Appended Judgments *are to inform"* suggests that images and judgments are corresponding entities. Judgments are the texts beneath the lines and hexagrams, while images refer to the images of the lines and hexagrams. Here, *"the Two Modes generate the Four Images"* refers to seven, eight, nine, and six.

Some scholars take seven, eight, nine, and six as the Four Images, and I now follow this interpretation. Yet if the subcommentators claim that these Four Images—seven, eight, nine, and six—are the Four Images to be demonstrated, their reasoning is excessively convoluted. Why? Seven, eight, nine, and six represent the positions of young yin, young yang, old yin, and old yang, generating the Four Images of the Eight Trigrams—they are not the Four Images that the *Yi* demonstrates.

Let us briefly examine this: the Four Images possess two meanings. The first refers to the Four Images generated by the Two Modes. The second refers to the Four Images of the *Yi*, those by which it demonstrates its teachings—such as Heaven-one, Earth-one, not Heaven-three, Earth-four—encompassing the transformations of Heaven-five. Through the mutual exchange of above and below, the Four Images complete their numerical configurations, and only then can the Eight Trigrams arise. Thus, Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui occupy the cardinal positions of the Four Images. It is not called the Five Images because five has no fixed position; by enumerating the four, the five is thereby understood.

Now, Heaven-five rides above Heaven-one and generates Earth-six below; it rides below Earth-two and generates Heaven-seven above; it rides to the right of Heaven-three and generates Earth-eight to the left; it rides to the left of Earth-four and generates Heaven-nine to the right—these are the forty-five numbers of the *Hetu*. Thus, the Four Images generated by the Two Modes are what the *Yi* possesses as its Four Images for demonstration.

As the *Appended Judgments* states: "Fortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss"—this is the first. "Regret and remorse are the images of anxiety and apprehension"—this is the second. "Transformation is the image of advance and retreat"—this is the third. "Firmness and yielding are the images of day and night"—this is the fourth.

Moreover, Master Kong’s *Subcommentary* states: "Images and judgments are corresponding entities. Judgments are the texts beneath the lines and hexagrams, while images refer to the images of the lines and hexagrams." The preceding sentence says, *"The Yi possesses Four Images by which it demonstrates,"* while the following sentence says, *"It strikes the judgments to inform."* Scrutinizing these four images—fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, transformation, firmness and yielding—since they are expounded in the *"striking of judgments,"* they align precisely with the images of the lines and hexagrams. Yet Master Kong further invokes the Four Images generated by the Two Modes, citing the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six—this is incorrect, is it not a grave error?

The Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams, tenth. The completion numbers of the Five Phases are: water, six; metal, nine; fire, seven; wood, eight. Water resides in Kan and generates Qian; metal resides in Dui and generates Kun; fire resides in Li and generates Xun; wood resides in Zhen and generates Gen. These occupy the four cardinal directions and generate Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun, together forming the Eight Trigrams.

The Two Modes attain ten to complete transformation, eleventh. These are the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases, originally belonging to the *Luoshu*. The illustrator of this diagram intends to encompass the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven’s numbers, twelfth. Earth’s numbers, thirteenth. The numbers of Heaven and Earth, fourteenth. Within these, fifteen are the functional numbers of Heaven and Earth—the numbers of nine and six. Including the forty numbers of the Five Phases, their sum is fifty-five, completing the numbers of Heaven and Earth.

The numbers of the Great Expansion, fifteenth. The *Classic* states: "The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five; this is how they complete transformation and enact the spirits." It further says: "The numbers of the Great Expansion are fifty, thus concealing the five numbers of Heaven and Earth." Master Han states: "To evolve the numbers of Heaven and Earth, what is relied upon is fifty," without mentioning the concealment of the five. Thus, Master Kong’s *Subcommentary* holds that fifty-five are the odd and even numbers of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, not the counting rods for evolving the numbers of Heaven and Earth.

Moreover, when various scholars divide the numbers of the Great Expansion and speak of *"dividing them in two"* as the central meaning, they describe the function of the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth, while in the end they expound the principles of the four operations completing the *Yi* and the eighteen changes forming the hexagrams. How can these be conflated as one, differing only in their central numbers? How can the numbers of tiles and milfoil stalks, which symbolize Heaven and Earth, be abandoned to seek their images? This is also an error of the subcommentators, who do not seek the meaning of Heaven-five withdrawing and concealing itself in secrecy.

Now, fifty-five are the ultimate numbers of Heaven and Earth. The numbers of the Great Expansion are the functional numbers of Heaven and Earth. It is because Heaven-five is unused that the numbers of the Great Expansion are five fewer than the numbers of Heaven and Earth. Some ask: "Heaven-five is unused—how is its disuse explained?" The answer: "Heaven-five is not unused; it is that the Four Images are used. Now, Heaven-one, Earth-two, Heaven-three, Earth-four—these are the generative numbers of the Four Images. Heaven-five steers the generative numbers of the Four Images to complete the Four Images of seven, nine, six, and eight, meaning that within the Four Images, five is present in all. Thus, it is known that five encompasses the Four Images, and the Four Images are all functions of five. By enumerating the four, five is thereby included. Therefore, the *Yi* speaks only of the Four Images to demonstrate that it does not speak of the Five Images."

Now, the meaning of milfoil divination is to esteem prognostication, to symbolize the functional numbers of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the numbers of the Great Expansion conceal the five numbers of Heaven and Earth.

Its use is forty-nine, sixteenth. Discussing the above: The numbers of the Great Expansion are fifty, but their use is forty-nine. Master Han’s commentary states: "To evolve the numbers of Heaven and Earth, what is relied upon is fifty. Their use is forty-nine, meaning one is unused. Though unused, it is used to achieve communication; though not a number, it is a number by which completion is achieved—this is the Supreme Ultimate of the *Yi*." Forty-nine is the ultimate of numbers. The origin cannot be illuminated by the origin itself; it must rely on existence. Thus, it is tested at the ultimate of existing things to necessarily clarify its originating source.

Master Kong’s *Subcommentary*: Jing Fang says: "Fifty refers to the ten days, twelve earthly branches, and twenty-eight constellations—totaling fifty. The one that is unused is Heaven’s unborn, which seeks the substantial through the insubstantial; thus, forty-nine are used." Ma Jichang says: "The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, referring to the North Star. The North Star generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the sun and moon; the sun and moon generate the four seasons; the four seasons generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases generate the twelve months; the twelve months generate the twenty-four qi."

The North Star remains fixed in its position, while the remaining forty-nine are set in motion and employed.

Xun Shuang says: "Each hexagram has six lines, and six times eight is forty-eight. Adding the two operative lines of *Qian* and *Kun* makes fifty. The *Initial Nine* (潜龙勿用) is not used, hence forty-nine are employed." Zheng Kangcheng says: "The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. The Five Phases’ *qi* permeates all things, so five is subtracted. The *Great Expansion* (大衍) further subtracts one, leaving forty-nine." Yao Xin and Dong Yu say: "The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. The six represents the number of lines in a hexagram, so it is subtracted, leaving forty-nine." Gu Ju says: "This number of fifty is established to enumerate the spirits. Though spirits transcend number, they are revealed through number. Thus, one number is left empty to illustrate the ineffable."

Now, examining the explanations of these various scholars, their interpretations diverge, each adhering to their own reasoning, yet none fully aligns with principle. I venture to discuss this:

Han’s *Commentary* takes the "empty one" as the Supreme Ultimate, yet it does not clarify the source of this interpretation. Why? The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; once the Two Modes are divided, Heaven first generates the one, initiating the sequence of numbers. Thereafter, the numbers of the Four Images and Five Phases arise, combining to make fifty-five—this is the ultimate number of Heaven and Earth. If the Supreme Ultimate were taken as the "empty one," then the *Great Expansion* should employ fifty-four. Otherwise, the remaining five would be superfluous. Moreover, the *Great Expansion* expands the numbers of Heaven and Earth, thus it pertains to the numbers *after* Heaven and Earth. Since the *Great Expansion* follows the numbers of Heaven and Earth, the Supreme Ultimate cannot correspond to the "empty one"—this is evident.

Furthermore, "the origin cannot be illuminated by the origin itself; it must rely on existence." Here, the Supreme Ultimate is termed the "origin." Yet the Supreme Ultimate is the time when primordial *qi* is undifferentiated and unified. Once *qi* begins to manifest, it is no longer called the origin. Thus, Han’s *Commentary* is also convoluted.

Some say: Han’s *Commentary* follows the intent of Fu Si. Fu Si’s *Commentary* stands unrivaled through the ages—how can one casually dismiss it? I reply: This must be Han’s figurative expression, not Fu Si’s original meaning. To speculate recklessly from one’s own mind is mere presumption. Now, let us verify it with the words of the sages. The *Yi* states: "The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes." Since the *Yi* speaks of "possessing," it does not refer to the origin. Is this not so?

As for the theories of Jing, Xun, Ma, and Zheng—all these worthies—each gathers the names and numbers of Heaven and Earth, forcibly matching them to the text. If one were to arbitrarily pair the names and numbers of Heaven and Earth, there would be no limit to such interpretations. Yet the numbers of Heaven and Earth arise and complete one another in mutual dependence, their principles linked like strung pearls, not to be redundantly appended. Though they may forcibly establish their meanings, upon deeper examination, they fail to align with the originating source. I shall discuss this further in the latter section.

**Discussion Below**

The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifteen, residing within and governing without. The numbers of the Five Phases total forty—why then are only forty-nine used? It is because Heaven’s five marks the beginning of transformation, dispersed across the positions of the Five Phases, thus establishing the central origin and fixing the image. Moreover, Heaven’s one, residing in supremacy and unmoving, serves the virtue of Heaven. Heaven’s virtue is nine. Heaven’s one is the beginning of images, the source of life, and the master of creation—hence it resides in supremacy and does not move.

Only the numbers of Heaven’s three, Earth’s two, and Earth’s four combine to form the yang number nine. Heaven’s three corresponds to *Qian*’s three lines, while Earth’s two and four correspond to *Kun*’s six lines. The Way of Earth is formless and complete, alternating in cycles of endings. Yang encompasses the meaning of yin. Thus, *Qian*’s three incorporates *Kun*’s six to form yang’s nine, governing the completed numbers of the Five Phases and facilitating their transformations. This is the meaning of "stirring and grasping" to symbolize these numbers.

Someone asks: The *Yi* states, "*Kun* fundamentally employs six"—now *Qian*’s three incorporates it. Does this mean *Kun*’s six is not used? I reply: No, it is contained within. The *Yi* speaks of the majority to imply the whole. The number six is the lesser, so by stating the greater, the lesser is understood. Thus, when yang advances, *Qian* fundamentally employs nine; when yang retreats, *Kun* fundamentally employs six. This is like the appointed day, where only the numbers of old yin and old yang are combined, while the numbers of young yin and young yang are contained within. Stating the greater includes the lesser—this is the consistent principle of the *Yi*.

**Young Yang: Seventeenth**
**Young Yin: Eighteenth**

**Old Yang: Nineteenth**
**Old Yin: Twentieth**
**Seven, Eight, Nine, Six Combined as Numbers: Twenty-First**

Moreover, the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six—when these four positions are combined and reckoned—yield: old yang, four nines, as thirty-six; young yang, four sevens, as twenty-eight; old yin, four sixes, as twenty-four; and young yin, four eights, as thirty-two.

**Qian’s Three Lines: Twenty-Second**
**Kun’s Three Lines: Twenty-Third**

Qian’s lines are odd; Kun’s lines are even. When the positions of Qian and Kun are divided, the odd and even positions are arrayed, and thus the sequence of yin and yang is established.

**Yin Within Yang: Twenty-Fourth**
**Yang Within Yin: Twenty-Fifth**
**Qian as Pure Yang: Twenty-Sixth**
**Kun as Pure Yin: Twenty-Seventh**

The *Classic* states: "One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao." Han’s *Commentary* says: "Dao is the name of the Origin. The Origin is not penetrated, nor is it derived from anything." When we speak of it as the Dao, it is quiescent and formless, beyond all imagery. Yet when its function reaches its utmost, the power of the Origin becomes manifest. Thus, only when the *Yi* attains the realm of the spirit does its fundamental substance become visible, and the Dao may be perceived.

Therefore, by exhausting change to fathom the spirit, and through the spirit to illuminate the Dao, though yin and yang differ, they are united in awaiting the One. In yin, it is called primordial yin, by which yin is generated; in yang, it is called primordial yang, by which yang is completed. Hence it is said: one yin and one yang.

Kong’s *Commentary* further states: "One refers to primordial yin and primordial yang—this is called the Dao." Observing the exegetes, they all take the Origin as their guiding principle, yet none expound the wondrous function of the Dao.

Moreover, though the Dao is formless, it must be set forth in its essential purport. The *Yi* declares "one yin and one yang—this is called the Dao," and thus necessarily imparts the meaning of one yin and one yang. Let us briefly discuss this:

Now, one yin and one yang refer to pure yin and pure yang. Yet pure yin and pure yang alone cannot generate things; they must await the union of one yin and one yang, only then can their wondrous function operate to bring about transformation. The Four Images arise therefrom, and the myriad things are born thereby. Thus it is said: "That which is not derived from anything—this is called the Dao."

As for pure yin and pure yang, they are what Heaven and Earth receive. Heaven is pure yang; Earth is pure yin. As for the things of the Five Phases, each contains the essence of one yin and one yang and is thereby generated. Thus, Heaven One and Earth Six combine to produce Water; Earth Two and Heaven Seven combine to produce Fire; Heaven Three and Earth Eight combine to produce Wood; Earth Four and Heaven Nine combine to produce Metal; Heaven Five and Earth Ten combine to produce Soil. These are the substances of the Five Phases, each receiving the essence of one yin and one yang.

As for animals and plants, they are generated by combining the essences of the Five Phases. Now, to clarify this meaning, we first set forth the forms of Heaven and Earth as pure yang and pure yin, then array the images of the Five Phases containing the two essences, and finally expound how humans receive the substance of the Five Phases.

**Li as Fire: Twenty-Eighth**
**Kan as Water: Twenty-Ninth**
**Zhen as Wood: Thirtieth**
**Dui as Metal: Thirty-First**
**Heaven Five and Earth Ten Combine to Form Soil: Thirty-Second**

Soil has no fixed image and flourishes in all four seasons. Earth is the accumulation of yin essence; receiving only pure yin, it cannot generate things. But when Heaven Five and Earth Ten combine to produce Soil, its form and substance are completed, adhering to Earth and bearing all things—thus it becomes one of the Five Phases. Therefore, the *Subcommentary* states: "Soil is but a distinct aspect within Earth." Hence Earth is called pure yin, while Soil receives the two essences.

**Humans Receive the Five Phases: Thirty-Third**

The *Yi* as a book is vast and all-encompassing. It contains the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. It combines the Three Powers and doubles them—thus the six hexagrams are none other than the Dao of the Three Powers.

Now, the Dao of the Three Powers occupies the positions of above, middle, and below. In their function, the Three Powers rely on the Five Phases, for without them, nothing can be accomplished. As for human life, externally it draws upon the benefits of the Five Phases, and internally it possesses the nature of the Five Phases. The Five Phases are Wood, Fire, Soil, Metal, and Water. The nature of Wood is benevolence; the nature of Fire is propriety; the nature of Soil is trustworthiness; the nature of Metal is righteousness; the nature of Water is wisdom. Thus, beings with rounded heads and square feet—the most spiritually endowed between Heaven and Earth—embody these natures.

Though humans may be utterly foolish, in their external conduct, they daily rely on the function of the Five Phases; in their internal nature, some obscure their inherent nature and fail to follow the teaching of the Five Constants. Can this not be lamented?

*Yi Shu Jun Yin Tu, Scroll One*

Here begins the transcription notes from the base text, with the *Siku Quanshu* edition supplying the missing character "Xi" (羲). #1 The base text leaves a blank space here, and the *Siku* edition reads "originates" (元之). It is suspected that the base text omits the character "Xi" (羲).

#2 The character "trustworthiness" (信) is missing in the original; supplied from the *Siku* edition. The base text leaves a blank space here.

#3 The character "J" (likely a graphical component) is missing in the original; supplied from the *Siku* edition. The base text leaves a blank space here.

#4 Following "its meaning" (其義), the base text is missing several characters, as is the *Siku* edition, which notes "lacuna" (闕).

#5 After "cannot" (不可), the base text contains missing text, and the *Siku* edition notes "lacuna" (闕).

#6 The character "position" (位) is missing in the original; the *Siku* edition also lacks it. Here it is supplied based on the context and preceding patterns.

#7 The character "then" (則) is absent in the *Siku* edition, which instead notes "lacuna" (闕) to indicate missing text in the original.

The foregoing arrangements of natural images serve to elucidate the principle of spontaneous interaction and mutual generation between above and below, thereby fulfilling the meaning of the eight trigrams’ transformations.

**Kan Gives Birth to Fu, Forty-Third Diagram**
**Li Gives Birth to Gou, Forty-Fourth Diagram**
The *Yi* posits the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams. Once the eight trigrams are arrayed, their images reside within; by doubling them, their lines reside within. Thus, the Supreme Ultimate is the origin of the Two Modes, while the eight trigrams are the origin of the hexagrams.

Why does the sequence of hexagrams begin with *Fu*? It is the inception of yang’s resurgence. Let us briefly discuss this: The four cardinal trigrams divide the positions of the four seasons and twelve months, while Qian, Kun, Gen, and Zhen serve to convey their transformations. By doubling them, their transformative functions are manifested.

Observing the Dao of their transformations, their meanings have a source. Thus, *Fu* arises within Kan, moves upon Zhen, interacts with Kun, and concludes by transforming into two Zhen, two Dui, and two Qian. From *Fu* to *Qian* spans six months—this is the meaning of yang lines ascending.

*Gou* arises within Li, wanes beneath Xun, interacts with Qian, and concludes by transforming into two Xun, two Gen, and two Kun. From *Gou* to *Kun* spans six months—this is the meaning of yin lines descending.

From *Fu* to *Kun*, twelve hexagrams govern twelve months. Each hexagram governs a month, dividing the twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal markers to encompass the reckoning of days and months.

Thus, Li and Kan divide Heaven and Earth: from midnight to noon is yang, and from noon to midnight is yin. If one further intermingles the images of other hexagrams, the total of three hundred eighty-four lines exhausts the Dao of the Three Powers.

Someone may ask: According to the numerical diagrams, the hexagrams and their lines divide the positions of the four seasons and twelve months, while Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun convey their transformations. Moreover, *Fu* arises within Kan, moves upon Zhen, and interacts with Kun. The *Yi* states: "Thunder within the earth—*Fu*." This precisely accords with its meaning. Yet *Gou* arises within Li, wanes beneath Xun, and interacts with Qian. The *Yi* states: "Wind beneath Heaven—*Gou*." Since Xun is not one of the four cardinal trigrams, its meaning differs from *Fu*. Now, the hexagram’s structure shows Xun succeeding Qian, altering its position to follow Dui—what does this signify?

The answer lies in adopting the image of *Guimei*. The *Yi* states: "*Guimei* is the great meaning of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not interact, the myriad things do not flourish. *Guimei* is the beginning and end of humanity." It relies on the meaning of the eldest son interacting with the youngest daughter. Yet when the youngest daughter governs the hexagram, it clarifies that the younger sister follows her elder sister in marriage, and the younger sister is not the principal wife—this is the meaning of the niece and concubine.

If the eldest son were to interact with the eldest daughter, though it might be called the enduring Dao of husband and wife, it would not fully embody the principle of broad continuity. Thus, only by concluding as it began—through *Guimei*—does it merit the *Yi*’s designation as the great meaning of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, in the hexagram’s transformation, it must follow *Guimei*. Since the younger sister is not the principal wife, the elder sister must govern the hexagram. Thus, its structure takes Dui to unite with Zhen, while its name takes Xun to succeed Qian. Does not the meaning of transformation reside herein?

**The Three Powers, Forty-Fifth Diagram**
Previous scholars’ explanations of the Three Powers all posit the arrangement of firm and yielding lines to form two qi, distributed across three positions to symbolize the Three Powers. They claim the sages drew them arbitrarily—yet this does not thoroughly accord with the meaning of the *Xici*.

The hexagrams are the natural images Heaven bestows. The sages first received them from the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, then observed the odd and even numbers of Heaven and Earth, and accordingly drew them to form the eight trigrams. Thus, they did not arbitrarily draw their numbers.

Let us briefly discuss this: The three lines that form a hexagram derive from the natural odd and even numbers of Heaven and Earth. Qian’s three lines, divided into three positions, represent Heaven’s odd number three, hence three positions. Earth’s even number three also occupies three positions. The remaining six hexagrams are all children of Qian and Kun, their bodies unified, hence they too are arranged in three positions.

Moreover, Heaven is solely yang, and Earth is solely yin. In isolation, pure yang or pure yin cannot generate things. Only when the qi of Heaven and Earth and the numbers of the Five Phases are established can they begin to produce the animate and inanimate. Thus, the *Classic* states: "Only after Heaven and Earth exist do the myriad things arise." How could the Dao of the Three Powers reside within a single qi?

The phrase "combining the Three Powers and doubling them" refers to the sage’s principle of doubling the hexagrams, not to the eight pure hexagrams. The Three Powers are Heaven, Earth, and Humanity; "doubling them" means to repeat them. The upper two lines represent Heaven, the middle two lines represent Humanity, and the lower two lines represent Earth. Since Humanity’s qi is born from the union of Heaven and Earth, it occupies the middle position between them. Thus, the second line of the ninth position is called "in the field," clarifying the Dao of Earth; the fifth line of the ninth position is called "a flying dragon in Heaven," clarifying the Dao of Heaven. This principle is thus clear and evident.

If one insists otherwise, let us consult the *Xici*: "The movement of the six lines embodies the Dao of the Three Extremes." It also states: "There is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them yields six." The six lines are none other than the Dao of the Three Powers. Furthermore, it says: "In ancient times, the sages created the *Yi* to accord with the principles of nature and destiny. Thus, they established the Dao of Heaven as yin and yang, the Dao of Earth as softness and hardness, and the Dao of Humanity as benevolence and righteousness. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Yi* forms hexagrams with six lines." All these passages speak of six lines encompassing the meaning of the Three Powers, so there is no theory of three lines representing the Three Powers. Is this not so?

As for the six lines all pertaining to human affairs, they embody the human order as images of Heaven’s laws and Earth’s patterns. Thus, the first and sixth lines also encompass the meaning of human affairs.

**Seventh Day’s Return (Discourse Forty-Six, Three Essays)**

**On the *Zhengyi* Commentary:**
The yang qi begins to be exhausted in the *Bo* hexagram, meaning the yang qi starts after the exhaustion of *Bo* and returns in the *Fu* hexagram after seven days. This interpretation is clear. However, Master Chu and Master Zhuang both state: "In the fifth month, one yin arises; by the eleventh month, one yang arises, totaling seven months." They speak of seven days rather than months to show that the growth of yang must be swift, hence changing "month" to "day."

Now, Han Si argues: "From the exhaustion of *Bo* to the return of *Fu* spans seven months." If one counts from the fifth month, how can it be called the "beginning of exhaustion"? Moreover, the *Lin* hexagram also describes yang growth in the eighth month, yet the *Fu* hexagram uniquely changes "month" to "day." Examining the intent of the commentary, this cannot be so. It likely follows the *Yiwei*’s theory of "six days and seven parts," aligning with Zheng Kangcheng’s view, though the text omits a full explanation.

According to the *Yiwei Qilan Tu*: "The qi of the hexagrams arises from Gen, Xun, Li, Kan, Zhen, and Dui, each governing a direction. The sixty hexagrams comprise 360 lines, corresponding to 360 days. The remaining five and a quarter days are divided: each day into eighty parts, totaling 400 parts for five days, and the quarter-day into twenty parts, making 420 parts in all. Dividing these among the sixty hexagrams (6 × 7 = 42) yields seven parts per hexagram, so each hexagram governs six days and seven parts."

The exhaustion of yang qi in the *Bo* hexagram occurs at the end of the ninth month. The tenth month is governed solely by the *Kun* hexagram, which precedes the six days and seven parts. From the exhaustion of *Bo* to the return of yang in *Fu*, one *Kun* hexagram intervenes, totaling six days and seven parts. Rounded to whole numbers, Fu Xi thus speaks of "seven days."

Yet the meaning of "seven days’ return" in Kong’s commentary, though correct in part, errs in its conclusion. Why? The *Yi* states "seven days’ return," and Fu Xi’s commentary also speaks of seven days. While he rightly cites the *Classic* and commentary to refute the errors of Chu and Zhuang, his later invocation of the *Yiwei* and Zheng’s "six days and seven parts" contradicts the *Classic* and commentary.

Moreover, the *Yiwei* and Zheng’s claim that each hexagram governs six days and seven parts fails to explain how this duration completes a hexagram’s meaning. Let us briefly discuss this: Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui are the four cardinal hexagrams, occupying four positions and generating the hexagrams Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun. Each position governs a season, and each line governs a month—this applies to the four pure hexagrams. If one counts the doubled hexagrams from *Fu* to *Qian*, six lines span six months; from *Gou* to *Kun*, six lines also span six months. Thus, each line clearly governs one month. To speak of "six days and seven parts" is a grave oversight by the commentator.

The "seven days’ return" signifies that at the end of the tenth month, the *Kun* hexagram concludes, yin retreats, and yang qi is reborn. Heaven has ten days, and yang ascends. At seven, it becomes young yang, where yin and yang interact to generate life. When yang returns, it is old yin. After yin’s numbers are exhausted, it becomes young yang on the seventh day. Thus, "seven days’ return" aligns with the *Classic* and commentary.

**In the *Xici*, it is said:**
"Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten"—these are the generative and completed numbers of the Five Phases. Heaven one generates water, Earth two generates fire, Heaven three generates wood, Earth four generates metal, and Heaven five generates earth—these are the generative numbers.

Thus, yang stands unpaired, and yin stands unmatched. Therefore, Earth six completes water, Heaven seven completes fire, Earth eight completes wood, Heaven nine completes metal, and Earth ten completes earth. Only then do yin and yang each find their counterparts, and the myriad things attain completion—hence these are called the "completed numbers."

It is further said: "Heaven’s numbers are five, Earth’s numbers are five; the five positions interact and each finds its union." This is how transformations are accomplished and the workings of spirits and gods are set in motion.

Moreover, the origin of numbers lies in yin and yang; the alternation of yin and yang unfolds along the sun’s path. From the winter solstice of the eleventh month to the summer solstice, yang advances. The first month marks spring, the phase of wood, when the sun reaches its southern extreme—yang arrives as yin recedes. Winter is the phase of water, where the arising of the first yang is reckoned as water’s number. At the summer solstice in the fifth month, the sun reaches its northern extreme—yin advances as yang retreats. Summer is the phase of fire, where the arising of the first yin is reckoned as fire’s number. Yet yin is not named by odd numbers; only in the sixth month, when the second yin arises, is it reckoned as fire’s number.

Thus, the *Yi* states that *Qian* holds correctness in the eleventh month, and *Kun* holds correctness in the sixth month, both advancing leftward. From the winter solstice to the summer solstice, yang advances. The first month is spring, the phase of wood, where three yang have arisen—hence three is wood’s number. From the summer solstice to the winter solstice, yin advances. The eighth month is autumn, the phase of metal, where four yin have arisen—hence four is metal’s number. The third month, late spring, is the phase of earth, where five yin arise—hence five is earth’s number. Such is the sequence.

Furthermore, the root of the myriad things arises from the primordial, and their flourishing begins in the subtle. For the myriad things to take form, they must progress through the subtle and the manifest. The sequence of the Five Phases likewise follows the subtle and the manifest. In the Five Phases’ constitution, water is the most subtle, numbered one; fire gradually manifests, numbered two; wood takes solid form, numbered three; metal is firm in substance, numbered four; earth is vast in nature, numbered five—this is the proper order.

Liu and Gu both held that water, fire, wood, and metal attain completion through earth’s number. Thus, water’s number completes at six, fire’s at seven, wood’s at eight, metal’s at nine, and earth’s at ten—this interpretation is also valid.

Yet upon examining the theories of many scholars, taking Heaven one to Heaven five as the Five Phases’ "generative numbers" fails to explain the principle by which they generate. Taking Earth six to Earth ten as the "completed numbers" fails to explain the principle by which they complete. Thus, scholars have not fully grasped their essence. This arises from not distinguishing the meaning of "image" and "form," nor the Dao and the instrument, nor the principles of above and below.

Let us briefly discuss this: The *Yi* states, "That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the instrument." Thus, what lies above Earth six is called the Dao, and what lies below Earth six is called the instrument. Heaven one and Earth one, Heaven three and Earth four—these four images have not yet taken on physical form, hence they are called "that which is above form," the Dao. Heaven five governs transformation: above, it rides Heaven one to generate Earth six, water’s number; below, it rides Earth two to generate Heaven seven, fire’s number; to the right, it rides Heaven three to generate Earth eight, wood’s number; to the left, it rides Earth four to generate Heaven nine, metal’s number. Earth ten responds to five and resides at the center, earth’s number. These have already taken on form and number, hence they are called "that which is below form," the instrument.

As for "image" and "form," the *Yi* says: "What is seen is called image"—the *Hetu* reveals its images. "What takes shape is called instrument"—the *Luoshu* arrays its forms. That which originates in Heaven inclines upward; that which originates in Earth inclines downward. Thus it is said: "The *He* [River] flows to communicate *Qian* and issue from Heaven; the *Luo* flows to convey *Kun* and emanate from Earth." The *Yi* speaks of the Dao and the instrument, which is why the sages created it in response.

The *Classic* states: "The *He* issued the *Tu*; the *Luo* issued the *Shu*; the sages took them as models." This is what it means.

Moreover, the numbers of the *Hetu* total forty-five, for it does not display earth’s number. It omits earth’s number because the *Hetu* arrays the images of the eight trigrams—if earth’s number were included, it would enter the realm of formed numbers. Thus, it encompasses their function without displaying their completed numbers. The *Luoshu*, with its fifty-five numbers, accomplishes transformation and manifests formed instruments. Therefore, the *Hetu* arrays the four images without speaking of the Five Phases, while the *Luoshu* unfolds the Five Phases without describing the four images. Yet the four images are also the completed numbers of metal, wood, water, and fire. In the *Hetu*, these are the numbers of old yang, old yin, young yang, and young yin; in the *Luoshu*, they are the numbers of metal, wood, water, and fire. The difference arises because the four images, when attached to earth’s number, form substance—hence the four images differ from the Five Phases. Yet all transform from Heaven five.

As for "Heaven’s numbers are five, Earth’s numbers are five; the five positions interact and each finds its union," this fully sets forth the generative numbers of the Five Phases. Though the Five Phases have completed numbers, without each finding its union, they would have nothing from which to generate. Thus, Heaven one unites with Earth six to generate water; Earth two unites with Heaven seven to generate fire; Heaven three unites with Earth eight to generate wood; Earth four unites with Heaven nine to generate metal; Heaven five unites with Earth ten to generate earth.

From Fuxi onward, the numbers were merely followed, but it was the Yellow Emperor who first named them. [Text missing: *yi bing ding*...] Now, many scholars take the arising of one yang as water’s number, the arising of two yin as fire’s number, the arising of three yang as wood’s number, the arising of four yin as metal’s number, and the arising of five yang as earth’s number—this forced matching [text missing: *shuo qiang pei*...] does not accord with the natural numbers of Heaven and Earth.

As for those who take the subtle and the manifest as gradual [stages], this is also not a comprehensive argument—why? Consider firmness and solidity: earth should not come after metal; consider vastness and magnitude: fire should not come after water. The essence of the Five Phases is each endowed by nature, arising from coincidental conjunctions and mutually dependent upon numbers. The theory of subtle and manifest truly does not align with the *Classic*’s intent.

Moreover, regarding the eleventh month when the first yang arises as an odd number: this refers to Heaven’s movement within the center of *Kan* (☵). The fifth month when the first yin arises as an even number: this refers to Earth’s movement within the center of *Li* (☲). As for the sixth month when the second yin arises as an even number, its origin remains unknown.

Below, let us examine the *Yiwei Qilan Tu* and Zheng’s theory of "six days and seven divisions," which draws from the stalks of *Qian* (☰) and *Kun* (☷), the old yang and old yin. The *Classic* states: "*Qian*’s stalks number two hundred and sixteen; *Kun*’s stalks number one hundred and forty-four—altogether three hundred and sixty, corresponding to the days of a year." The *Subcommentary* notes: "This presents a general outline, omitting the quarter-day of five days." It further states: "The two hexagrams together comprise three hundred and eighty-four lines, with yin and yang each half. The yang lines number one hundred and ninety-two positions, each line having thirty-six, totaling six thousand nine hundred and twelve. The yin lines number one hundred and ninety-two positions, each line having twenty-four, totaling four thousand six hundred and eight. Together, yin and yang sum to eleven thousand five hundred and twenty, corresponding to the number of all things."

Moreover, the *Classic* assigns the three hundred and sixty stalks of *Qian* and *Kun*, the old yang and old yin, to the days of a year, without separately initiating another count. As for the relationship between hexagrams and lines, the meaning of the *Yiwei* and Zheng’s "six days and seven divisions" remains unclear. The total lines of yin and yang number three hundred and eighty-four. Though the *Yiwei* and Zheng’s theory align the lines of the four cardinal hexagrams—*Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen* (☳), and *Dui* (☱)—with the number twenty-four to match the days of a year, this again differs from the Sage’s words.

How do we know this? From *Zi* to *Hai*, the twelve months govern the lines of the twelve hexagrams. The lines of the twelve hexagrams span from *Fu* (䷗) to *Kun* (䷁). How can one adopt the theories of miscellaneous texts and worthies to disrupt the *Classic*’s meaning?

Some may object, citing the *Tuanzhuan*: *"Lin* (䷒) reaches the eighth month, and there is misfortune." The *Xiang* says: "*Lin*: the firm gradually lengthens, joyful and compliant, firm and central with response—greatly penetrating, rectifying Heaven’s Dao. Reaching the eighth month, there is misfortune, for decline does not last long." The annotations of various scholars differ. He [Xiao] states: "From the establishment of *Zi* when yang arises to the establishment of *Wei* is the eighth month." Chu states: "From the establishment of *Yin* to the establishment of *You* is the eighth month." Kong’s *Subcommentary* further says: "Now, examining this annotation: 'The way of the petty man lengthens, and the way of the noble man declines.' It should refer to the time of *Pi* (䷋), with *Lin* established in *Chou*; thus, reaching *Pi*, established in *Shen*, is the eighth month." The reasoning is untenable. Let us briefly discuss it:

The explanations of various scholars all fail to align with *Lin*’s meaning. How do we know? The words of the hexagrams and images each discuss the body of a single hexagram. *Lin* governs the month of *Chou*. If He counts from the establishment of *Zi* when yang arises, the hexagram’s words should belong to *Fu*, not *Lin*. If Chu counts from *Yin*, the words should belong to *Tai* (䷊), not *Lin*. If Kong’s reasoning takes *Shen*’s *Pi* as the eighth month, then *Pi*’s six-three should diminish *Tai*’s nine-three, which does not correspond to *Lin*’s nine-three. Now, if we take the establishment of *Wei* as the eighth month and diminish *Lin*’s nine-two with *Zhu* (䷒)’s six-two, this aligns with the meaning.

Why? *Lin*’s *Xiang* says: "Gradually lengthening." The *Commentary* states: "The yang way turns and advances; the yin way daily diminishes." *Zhu*’s *Xiang* also says: "Gradually lengthening." The *Commentary* states: "The yin way desires to advance and lengthen; the right way is not yet entirely extinguished." Now, as the lines of the two hexagrams correspond and their *Xiang* words both speak of yin and yang gradually lengthening, their meaning must be so—hence designating the establishment of *Wei* as the eighth month.

Some may ask: When King Wen arranged the hexagrams, it was the late Shang era. How could the first month be determined by Zhou’s system? The answer: The Duke of Zhou composed the line statements, building upon his father’s foundation, so the line words often concern events after King Wen. Thus, we know King Wen’s intent was completed by the Duke of Zhou, who fixed the Zhou system. Moreover, the *Changes* has two names: under Xia, it was called *Lianshan*; under Shang, *Guicang*; under Zhou, *Zhouyi*. *Lianshan* was the title of Shennong; *Guicang* was the title of Xuanyuan. Since *Lianshan* and *Guicang* are both dynastic titles, the Zhou named theirs to distinguish it from others, just as the *Rites of Zhou* does.

Moreover, since the *Changes* was titled *Zhou* to establish its proper name, the Duke of Zhou could not but determine its months according to the Zhou calendar. Who could claim otherwise? Yet He Shi’s interpretation, taking the first month as the eleventh (*zi*) and the eighth month as the sixth (*wei*), merely examines the branches without tracing the root. As for Kong Yingda’s citation of Fu Si’s *Commentary*, which holds that the Dao of the noble one wanes while the Dao of the petty man waxes—this must refer to the meaning of the *Pi* hexagram. Yet when yin prevails, the Dao of the petty man waxes, and when yang prevails, the Dao of the noble one waxes; this principle is not confined solely to the *Pi* hexagram.

Furthermore, *Wang’s Summary of Hexagrams* states: In *Zhun*, the petty man gradually waxes, difficulty lies within while prosperity lies without—this stands in opposition to the *Lin* hexagram. In *Lin*, when yang waxes, yin is imperiled; in *Zhun*, when yin waxes, yang is imperiled. In *Lin*, two yang lines reside within, and the Dao of the noble one daily waxes; in *Zhun*, two yin lines reside within, and the Dao of the petty man daily advances. As for the ominous portent of the eighth month: the Way of Heaven, like the cycles of cold and heat, sees yang retreat while yin waxes. When yin reaches two lines and attains its proper position in the center, a warning of decline is thus conveyed. Yang revives in the eleventh month as *Fu*; by the twelfth month, it becomes *Lin*. Yin wanes in the fifth month as *Gou*; by the sixth month, it becomes *Zhun*. From the eleventh month (*zi*) to the sixth month (*wei*) spans eight months.

**Eight Trigrams in the River Chart, Fifty-Second**
**Generative Numbers of the Five Phases in the Luo Writing, Fifty-Third**

Someone asked: The *Luo Writing* states: one is water, two is fire, three is wood, four is metal, five is earth. Why does this not align with the positions of the Five Phases’ numbers in the *Dragon Chart*?

The answer: This refers to the arrangement of their generative numbers. Though it presents the generative numbers, these are already the numbers of interaction. In the lower section, earth’s dominion over the four seasons is explained, where the completion numbers are fully set forth.

Moreover, the *Luo Writing* and the *Nine Categories* derive solely from the numbers of the Five Phases. Thus, it first presents the already-interacted generative numbers, then supplements them with the earth number, thereby revealing the completion numbers.

**Ten Generates the Five Phases and Their Mutual Generation, Fifty-Fifth**

*Discourse on the Dragon Chart and Turtle Writing, Upper*

The *Book of Changes* states: "The River yields the Chart, the Luo yields the Writing; the sage takes them as his model."

**From the *Chunqiu Wei*:**
The Yellow River flows to convey the Heavenly Embryo, issuing the celestial treasure; the Luo River courses to release the Earthly Talisman, bearing the terrestrial tally. The Yellow River’s Dragon Chart emerges, the Luo’s Turtle Writing responds.

The *River Chart* comprises nine scrolls; the *Luo Writing*, six. The *Book of Documents: Justice* states: “The Luo Writing’s nine categories each bear script—this is the Writing. It is said: ‘Heaven then bestowed it upon Yu.’ What Heaven thus granted Yu was none other than the *Luo Writing*.”

The *Han Records of the Five Phases* records Liu Xiang’s view: Fuxi succeeded Heaven and ruled; the River yielded the Chart, and he thereby drew the Eight Trigrams. Yu governed the floodwaters, received the *Luo Writing*, and modeled the *Great Plan* upon it. Kong Yingda adopted this account, asserting that the turtle bore the *Luo Writing*—though the *Classic* contains no such event. The *Central Candidate* and various *Weft* texts recount how the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu received the Chart and Writing, all describing dragons bearing the Chart and turtles bearing the Writing. The authorship of the *Weft* texts remains unknown; scholars investigating their origins deem them forgeries arising during the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping. These works first appeared at the end of the Former Han, their originator unidentified. Earlier scholars transmitted this tradition, so Kong’s commentary treats the *Nine Categories* as a divine turtle bearing script upon its back, arranging numbers from one to nine. Observing these marks, he ordered them into the *Nine Categories*. When implemented, they ensured the constancy of the Dao in its proper sequence. The attribution to Yu’s ordering stems from the assumption that celestial speech must be concise; it should not exhibit such meticulous arrangement or repetition. Thus, Yu is credited with arranging and ordering them.

Yet once Yu obtained the *Nine Categories*, the constant Dao gained its sequence. Before the *Luo Writing* existed, how was the Dao’s order maintained? Eras differed in purity and turbidity; teachings varied in clarity and obscurity. Before the Three Sovereigns, governance thrived without texts—why would the *Luo Writing* alone be indispensable? After receiving the *Nine Categories*, however, adhering to its model brought order, while defiance brought chaos.

Moreover, the original *Luo Writing*’s celestial speech was concise, lacking any inherent numerical sequence. Tradition holds that Yu merely followed and ordered it. Kong’s commentary thus attributes the ordering to Yu: the first twenty-eight characters—“First Day,” and so on—must have been Yu’s additions. The eighteen characters beginning with “Reverent Use” and “Agricultural Use” are, according to the elder Liu and Master Gu, the turtle’s own script. The younger Liu, however, ascribes these to Yu’s ordering. The turtle’s script originally contained only twenty characters, without clear evidence of their origin; thus, both interpretations are preserved.

Upon examining the arguments of these scholars, most contradict the *Classic*’s intent. In essence, the *Nine Categories* represent Yu’s ordering of the *Luo Writing*, which he then established as a model—this was not a divine turtle bearing the Writing to Yu in his time. How can this be demonstrated? Consider the following:

Jizi said: “In former times, Gun dammed the floodwaters, confounding the Five Phases. The Lord was enraged and withheld the *Great Plan* and *Nine Categories*, disrupting the constant norms. Gun hastened to his death, and Yu then succeeded him. Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Great Plan* and *Nine Categories*, restoring the constant norms.” Nowhere does this mention a divine turtle bearing the Chart. Only Kong’s commentary states that Heaven granted Yu the *Luo Writing*, a divine turtle bearing script upon its back, arranging numbers up to nine. Later scholars expanded upon this, embellishing the celestial text’s words and characters. Subsequent generations followed these accounts, asserting that Yu personally received the *Luo Writing* and arranged the *Nine Categories*.

Yet the *Classic* contains no record of the Chart or Writing, save the *Changes: Appended Judgments*, which states: “The River yields the Chart, the Luo yields the Writing; the sage takes them as his model.” This refers to Confucius’s composition of the *Changes*. Thus, the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* originated in the era of Fuxi. In ancient times, the River issued the Dragon Chart, the Luo the Turtle Writing. Fuxi □□□ drew the Eight Trigrams, then doubled them to form the sixty-four hexagrams □□□□□□□□□□□□□□. King Wen composed the *Hexagram Statements*, the Duke of Zhou the *Line Statements*, and Confucius appended the *Ten Wings*—thus the Dao of the *Changes* was illuminated.

Observe the present *Dragon Chart*: its positions number nine, encompassing the Four Images and Eight Trigrams. Its vertical and horizontal alignments conform to the natural numbers of Heaven and Earth—surely no later forger could fabricate this. The Dragon Chart reveals the trigrams; only a sage could draw them. The trigrams contain all images; only a sage could elucidate them. By this reasoning, the *Luo Writing* did not emerge in Yu’s time.

The *Book of Documents* states that Heaven bestowed the *Nine Categories* upon Yu. This means Heaven endowed Yu with sagely virtue, enabling him to comprehend the *Luo Writing*’s principles. He ordered and arranged it, leaving a model for posterity. The *River Chart*, transmitted through the ages, contains numbers from one to nine, embodying the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and the numbers of the Five Phases. The *Luo Writing*, however, pertains solely to the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases. Fuxi merely drew the trigrams to transmit teachings, leaving the Five Phases’ numbers unmanifest. Thus, Yu further expounded the Five Phases, clarifying the *Nine Categories*.

Modern scholars claim Yu received the *Luo Writing*, which recorded celestial speech with enumerated characters—this is not a sound argument. “What words does Heaven speak? The sage models himself upon it”—surely it cannot be otherwise.

Some may ask: “Is this not so? Let us consult the *Classic*.” Yao entrusted nine ministers, each overseeing one duty. The *Nine Categories* correspond to the nine ministers’ offices.

As for the Eight Governances of agriculture, the offices of Minister of Works and Minister of Education were already established in the eras of Tang and Yu. The Five Regulations were rectified by the Xi and He clans. Thus, these institutions were not established only after Yu received the *Luo Writing*. Moreover, Heaven hangs forth its images to reveal fortune and misfortune, and the sage models himself upon them; the Yellow River yields the *Chart*, the Luo River yields the *Writing*, and the sage takes them as his standard. Heaven’s images are... Though their meanings are interwoven, none but the utmost sage can illuminate them... As for the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, none but Fuxi could have drawn them. The trigrams unite their images, and none but King Wen could have elaborated them. The rise of line-images was such that none but the Duke of Zhou could have expounded them. Thus, Confucius said: “After King Wen’s passing, does not his culture reside here?” He also said: “Heaven has endowed me with virtue,” thereby knowing that Heaven endows sages with wisdom, silently investigating the subtle and the manifest—this is called bestowing upon them. Thus, the proclamation of Zhong Hui states: “Heaven then bestowed upon the king courage and wisdom, to rectify the myriad states.” Moreover, when the Kong clan cites Jizi’s words that “Heaven then bestowed upon Yu the *Nine Categories*,” and thereby claims it was the *Luo Writing* emerging from the turtle’s back, they fail to consider that the sage’s words—“The River yields the *Chart*, the Luo yields the *Writing*”—precede the composition of the *Changes*. Furthermore, the Nine Regulations were already practiced before the Tang and Yu eras. To claim that only after Yu received the *Luo Writing* did the constant Dao emerge—is this not a distortion?

Below is a discussion:
The *Spring and Autumn Weft* states: “The *Luo Writing* comprises six chapters.” The Kong clan says: “The *Luo Writing* was borne by a divine turtle, its patterns arrayed upon its back, with numbers from one to nine.” Yet the turtle writings transmitted in later ages only summarize the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases, and it remains unclear which is correct. Let us briefly examine this: The *Spring and Autumn Weft* records six chapters of the *Luo Writing*, which do not align with the numbers of the Five Phases or the *Nine Categories*, nor is their meaning clear. The Kong clan claims the *Luo Writing* contains numbers from one to nine, referring to the *Nine Categories* in the *Book of Documents*, from the Five Phases to the Five Blessings and Six Extremities. Yet among the *Nine Categories* in the *Book of Documents*, only the Five Phases encompass the natural numbers of Heaven and Earth; the remaining eight regulations were devised by Yu after weighing celestial timing and human affairs—these are not the patterns borne by the turtle. Now, examining the *Hongfan Wuxing Commentary*, whenever disasters and anomalies are discussed, the Five Phases are invariably taken as their foundation. Moreover, when Gun, though not a sage, muddled the Five Phases, the constant norms were thereby taught. Thus, it is known that the Five Phases are the natural numbers bestowed by Heaven, their patterns borne by the divine turtle; the remaining eight regulations were extended by Yu, just as the *Dragon Chart* only bears the Four Images and the eight pure trigrams, while the remaining sixty-four hexagrams were elaborated by Fuxi through observing and examining the suitability of things, extending them with line-images. Moreover, the Five Phases encompass natural properties, the Eight Trigrams convey natural images, and the sage further transforms them, classifying each by kind to observe fortune and misfortune. Thus, the turtle writings transmitted today are not false. Yet if doubts remain, let us refine them through question and answer.

Someone may ask: “If the *Chart* and *Writing* both emerged in Fuxi’s era, then the *Nine Categories* were also set forth in Fuxi’s time. Why should it be said that Yu ordered and arranged them?”
The answer is: The *River Chart* of the Eight Trigrams conveys their images, so their positions can be fully arrayed; the *Luo Writing* of the Five Phases contains their properties, and their kinds must be distinguished through writing. In Fuxi’s era, the world was simple and the people unsophisticated, and writing had not yet been created. Thus, the *Nine Categories* could not be transmitted, and only their numbers were extended. It was the sage Yu who later elaborated the *Nine Categories*, establishing them as a model for the world. The *Nine Categories* began with Yu.

Someone may ask: “If the *Dragon Chart* encompasses the Five Phases, then the Five Phases were already present in the *Dragon Chart*. Why would the turtle writing be needed?”
The answer is: Though it encompasses the Five Phases, it has a central position but lacks the number of Earth, totaling only forty-five. Thus, it has their image but not their full form—only the meanings of the Four Images and Eight Trigrams. The turtle writing, however, fully contains the generative and completion numbers of the Five Phases, totaling fifty-five. The *Changes* encompass both image and vessel, so the sage relied upon the *Chart* and *Writing* to compose it.

Someone may ask: “The *Book of Documents* states that ‘Heaven then bestowed upon Yu the *Hongfan* and *Nine Categories*,’ which must be the *Luo Writing*. Now, your conjectures dismantle this...”
The answer is: Confucius spoke of the *River yielding the Chart* and the *Luo yielding the Writing* before Fuxi drew the *Changes*, so it cannot be said that they emerged in the era of Yu of Xia. If it were otherwise, the *Luo Writing* would have appeared again in Yu’s time. If this were true, then before Yu there were no *Nine Categories*. How, then, could the *Nine Regulations* in the *Canon of Yao* be so clear and evident?

Someone may ask: “The *Dragon Chart* and *Turtle Writing* transmitted today are not recorded in the *Classics*, and the meanings of the weft texts are obscure—are these not wild claims?”
The answer is: Though the *Dragon Chart* and *Turtle Writing* are not recorded in the *Classics*, they have been transmitted in succession by former worthies. Moreover, their numbers and images align with their positions, the trigrams pair without excess or deficiency, and they accord with nature—these are not things human intellect could devise. Furthermore, all books on yin and yang from ancient times to the present take them as their foundation. As for penetrating the virtue of spirit and light and the principles of Heaven and Earth, their responses are like echoes and shadows—how could they be false?
