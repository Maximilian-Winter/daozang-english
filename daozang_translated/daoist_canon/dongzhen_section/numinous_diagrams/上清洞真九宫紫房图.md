### **Nine Palaces Purple Chamber and Three Cinnabar Fields Formula**

When one speaks of "retreating inward," it refers to moving from the south backward to the north at the nape. Measuring upward from the space between the eyebrows:

- Retreating inward by three *fen* forms the **Guard-Inch Double Field**;
- Retreating inward by one *cun* forms the **Hall of Light Palace**;
- Retreating inward by two *cun* forms the **Cavern Chamber Palace**;
- Retreating inward by three *cun* forms the **Cinnabar Field Palace**;
- Retreating inward by four *cun* forms the **Flowing Pearl Palace**;
- Retreating inward by five *cun* forms the **Jade Emperor’s Palace**.

One *cun* above the **Hall of Light** is the **Celestial Court Palace**; one *cun* above the **Cavern Chamber** is the **Ultimate Real Palace**; one *cun* above the **Cinnabar Field** is the **Mysterious Cinnabar Palace**; one *cun* above the **Flowing Pearl** is the **Grand Sovereign’s Palace**. Altogether, there are nine palaces within the head.

The **Upper Cinnabar Field Palace** lies above the space between the eyebrows; the **Middle Cinnabar Field Palace** resides in the **Crimson Palace** of the heart; the **Lower Cinnabar Field Palace** is three *cun* below the navel. These constitute the **Three Cinnabar Fields**.

The **Red Child** dwells in the Upper Cinnabar Field; the **Perfected Person** resides in the Middle Cinnabar Field; the **Infant Sovereign Lord** abides in the Lower Cinnabar Field.

Within the Cinnabar Field Palace dwells the **Upper Prime True Unity Sovereign Lord**, who, together with another, jointly governs the Cinnabar Field Palace—this is the Way of guarding the **Three Primes’ True Unity**.

The **Guard-Inch Double Field** contains within it the **Yellow Gate and Purple Portal**, as well as the **Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber**, which together form the left and right structures of the Guard-Inch.

On the left side of the Guard-Inch stands the **Crimson Terrace**, and on the right, the **Yellow Gate**. The Perfected Persons of this palace enter and exit through the passage between the **Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace**. Thus, the terrace and gate are placed to the left and right of the Way to regulate extraordinary *qi* and await the comings and goings of the Perfected Persons.

Within the **Guard-Inch Double Field** dwell two great deities.

In the **Hall of Light Palace**, on the left resides the **Luminous Youth Perfected Lord**, on the right the **Luminous Maiden Perfected Official**, and in the center the **Bright Mirror Spirit Lord**. These three lords jointly govern the palace, all clad in brocade robes, their waists adorned with four red bells, their mouths holding red mirrors—all bells and mirrors are of red jade. Their forms resemble infants, seated either facing outward or toward one another.

In the **Cavern Chamber Palace** dwell three Perfected Ones: on the left, the **Peerless Noble Son**; on the right, the **White Prime Lord**; and in the center, the **Yellow Old Lord**. These three jointly govern the palace—this is the **Flying Perfected Way**.

The **Cinnabar Field Palace** is perfectly square, each side one *cun* in length.

The **Flowing Pearl Palace** is the abode of the **Controller of Destiny**, where the subtleties of its Way are enacted.

The **Jade Emperor’s Palace** is inhabited by the **Jade Clarity Divine Mother**.

The **Celestial Court Palace** is occupied by the **Upper Clarity Perfected Maiden**.

The **Ultimate Real Palace** is the dwelling of the **Supreme Ultimate Empress**.

The **Mysterious Cinnabar Palace** is one *cun* square, a **Purple Chamber and Green Chamber** filled within with vermilion mist. Therein resides the **Mud-Pill Great Unity Perfected Lord**, whose form resembles that of a newborn infant. Seated upon a golden couch within a jade canopy, he wears a robe of purple embroidered brocade, his waist adorned with **Flowing-Fire Bells**. These **Flowing-Fire Bells** are without substance yet radiate crimson light; when moved, their sound carries for a hundred thousand *li*—they are the treasured bells of the **Central Yellow Great Unity Perfected Person of Upper Clarity**. Seated upright in the **Mysterious Cinnabar Palace**, facing outward without attendants on either side, he is thus called the **Great Unity Perfected Lord**.

The **Three Ones** are the spiritual essence of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids and humors, and the jade chamber of the soul’s essence. Thus, the **Stomach Pool** is square in form to receive things, while the **Brain Palace** is round and empty to accommodate the Perfected. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit mist; virtue is complete as Heaven and Earth, and the cavern is one with the **Great Mystery**—hence it is named the **Mud-Pill**.

The **Mud-Pill** is the spirit of the bodily form.

The **Grand Sovereign’s Palace** is inhabited by the **Supreme Lord and Queen**.
