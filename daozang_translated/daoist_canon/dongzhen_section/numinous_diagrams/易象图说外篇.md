**Outer Chapters on the Diagrams of the *Yi* Symbols, Juan One**
*By Zhang Li of Qingjiang, a later scholar*

The *Yi* is the Dao.
The Dao of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—the Three Powers.

When we examine the sages and divine beings of antiquity, who followed Heaven to establish the ultimate and initiated the cultivation of human norms, they feared that later generations would fail to awaken or comprehend, and thus first revealed this Dao to humankind.

This Dao—when pursued, its beginning cannot be fathomed, for yin and yang have no origin; when traced, its end cannot be measured, for following principle knows no limit.
In its minuteness, it penetrates the infinitesimal; in its vastness, it encompasses Heaven and Earth.
Heaven attains it and hangs forth the sun and moon in constant motion; Earth attains it and bears the rivers and mountains without tilting.

The sages, gazing upward, observed its mysterious images and thus drew two lines to emulate Heaven;
looking downward, they examined its compliant patterns and thus drew one unbroken and one broken line to emulate Earth.
The *Yi* diagrams, with an odd line above and an even line below, are what is called "the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes."
Master Zhou said: "The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; it rests and generates yin."
Heaven has yin and yang; Earth has softness and hardness. Thus, odd and even each generate odd and even, and the Four Symbols are complete.
Heaven’s images descend; Earth’s qi ascends.
The yin-yang and hard-soft of the *Yi* diagrams are what is called "the Two Modes generate the Four Symbols."
Master Zhou said: "Yang transforms and yin unites, generating water, fire, wood, metal, and earth."
Heaven has the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer; Earth has the four directions—east, west, south, north. Thus, the Four Symbols each generate odd and even, and the Eight Trigrams are manifest.
*Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* arise above—gazing upward and observing in reverse, these are the images of Heaven.
*Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* arise below—looking downward and examining in sequence, these are the forms of Earth.
This is what is called "the Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams."
Master Zhou said: "The true of the Limitless, the essence of the two and five, wondrously unite and congeal: the Dao of *Qian* completes the male, the Dao of *Kun* completes the female."

Pure yang is the vigor of *Qian*.
Yielding yin is the origin of *Kun*.
Yang with outward brilliance is *Li* as fire.
Yin with inward clarity is *Kan* as rivers.
Yang that rises is the image of *Gen*.
Yin that hollows is the source of *Dui*.
Drumming and stirring, moving like *Zhen* thunder.
Breathing and swaying, spreading like *Xun* wind.
The eight images interact, and the Dao of the *Yi* becomes evident.

Only humanity stands uniquely within them, able to emulate them.
The *Record* says: "Humans are the virtue of Heaven and Earth, the union of yin and yang, the convergence of ghosts and spirits, the finest of the Five Phases."
The roundness of the crown is *Qian* as the head.
The hanging of the hair is *Kun* as the abdomen.
*Zhen* arms reside above, moving the hands; *Xun* thighs reside below, following the feet.
*Gen* is the nose and *Dui* the mouth; *Kan* the ears and *Li* the eyes.
Thirsty, one drinks; hungry, one eats.
At dawn, one labors; at dusk, one rests.

Amidst the tumultuous and rushing currents, how does humanity differ from other beings? By not being enslaved to things, one emerges as what is called a sage. The common people use these principles daily yet remain unaware, while only the sage rises above their kind, standing apart from the multitude.

The sage’s virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, their illumination rivals the sun and moon, their grasp encompasses the cosmos, and their governance regulates yin and yang. Benevolence and wisdom blanket the world, their virtuous influence extends abundantly to posterity, achieving central harmony so that "Heaven and Earth take their proper places, and the myriad things are nurtured." Sincerity moves the spirits to draw near, and even birds and beasts grow tame.

Only when the Way of the sage is thus does one truly "embody their form." Mencius said: "All people may follow their greater nature to become great persons, or their lesser nature to become petty persons." Yet all things are complete within me—one need only turn inward to achieve sincerity. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are inherently mine. Benevolence and wisdom emulate Heaven’s yin and yang, while righteousness and propriety model Earth’s softness and firmness. Separately considered, benevolence is yin and wisdom yang; propriety is soft and righteousness firm.

"Heaven’s Way moves vigorously"—I embody this to strive unceasingly. "Earth’s power is receptive"—I follow this to "bear virtue and embrace all things." I emulate *Li* to illuminate, and practice *Kan* to preserve constant virtue. I rest in *Gen* to ensure my thoughts do not overstep their bounds, and act through *Zhen* with reverent caution. I repeat *Xun* to issue commands and conduct affairs, and adorn *Dui* to engage in discourse and learning with friends. The six hexagrams from *Qian* to *Zhen* return to the self, while *Xun* and *Dui* instruct others.

In times of *Tai*, one "shapes and assists," as the *Image* of *Tai* states: "Heaven and Earth unite in *Tai*." Thus, one "shapes Heaven and Earth’s Way, assists their proper functions, and guides the people." In times of *Pi*, one practices frugal virtue and rejects glory, for the *Image* of *Pi* says: "Heaven and Earth do not unite in *Pi*." The noble person "practices frugal virtue to avoid calamity, refusing to be honored with rank."

In *Yi*, one transforms toward goodness and corrects faults, as the *Image* of *Yi* declares: "Wind and thunder are *Yi*." The noble person "sees goodness and adopts it, recognizes faults and reforms." In *Sun*, one curbs desires and tempers anger, for the *Image* of *Sun* states: "A mountain above a marsh is *Sun*." The noble person "tempers anger and curbs desires."

Whether in grand acts of yielding or expelling tyranny, or in minor matters of movement and stillness, speech and silence, the Way is fully contained in the *Yi*. Manifest, it becomes ritual and music; hidden, it governs ghosts and spirits. The Three Bonds and Five Constants endure across a hundred generations. As the *Commentary* says: "Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them." Cultivating one’s nature to preserve it is the gateway to the Way and righteousness.

The *Yi* is how the sage elevates virtue and expands endeavors. Fearing later generations would fail to understand, they created the *Yi* to awaken people to its Way. Though I am but a foolish novice, I dare aspire to emulate the worthy, the sage, and Heaven itself. Observing the images and expounding the diagrams, I arrange them in order, calling this *The Origins of the Great Yi’s Hexagrams*.

**Image and Number I**
The *Commentary* states: "The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate."
Master Zhu said: "The *Yi* concerns the transformations of yin and yang; the Supreme Ultimate is its principle." The term "Supreme Ultimate" signifies the utmost extremity, combining the meaning of a standard. It is the pivot of creation and the root of all things. Devoid of form, sound, or scent, it was first depicted as a circle by Master Lianxi of the Song, and later diagrams followed this convention. The *Explanation of Script and Symbol* says: "Only in the beginning was the Supreme Ultimate. The Way established itself in the One, giving rise to Heaven and Earth and transforming the myriad things." The One is the beginning of numbers.

**Image and Number II**
To the right: the images of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, each with its own Supreme Ultimate.
Shao Kangjie said: "Heaven opens at *zi*, Earth splits at *chou*, and humanity is born at *yin*." The Xia dynasty took the month when the Dipper’s handle first points to *yin* as the first month, calling it the "human alignment." The *Yi* says *Lian Shan* takes *Gen* as its head, for *Gen* represents humanity. The *Zhou Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram also takes the human body as its image. The Shang dynasty took the month when the Dipper points to *chou* as the first month, calling it the "Earth alignment." The *Yi* says *Gui Cang* takes *Kun* as its head, for *Kun* represents Earth. The Zhou dynasty took the month when the Dipper points to *zi* as the first month, calling it the "Heaven alignment." The *Yi* says *Zhou Yi* takes *Qian* as its head, for *Qian* represents Heaven.

Commentators explain that mountains emit clouds, Earth contains all things, and Heaven encompasses the six directions—this aptly describes *Qian* and *Kun*, but does not fully capture *Gen*. *Gen* is how the myriad things achieve completion and renewal. Humanity, as the spirit of all things, thus takes precedence in discourse. The Xia valued loyalty, embodying humanity’s righteousness; the Shang valued substance, embodying Earth’s principle; the Zhou valued culture, embodying Heaven’s image. The Three Dynasties rose in succession, each revering a different alignment, yet when Confucius answered Yanzi’s question on governance, he said: "Follow the Xia calendar, ride the Shang chariot, and wear the Zhou cap." Emulating Heaven’s Way, enacting Earth’s benefits, and employing humanity’s principles—this is evident. Such is the unchanging great law of a hundred kings.

Thus it is said: "Confucius inherited the legacy of Yao and Shun, and took Wen and Wu as his models, aligning above with Heaven’s seasons and below with the earth and waters." Master Han said: "What takes form above is called Heaven; what takes form below is called Earth; what is endowed between them is called humanity. Above, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are all Heaven; below, grasses, trees, mountains, and rivers are all Earth; between them, the barbarians, birds, and beasts are all humanity." Master Cheng said: "Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things are born between them—only then are the Three Powers complete. Humanity is the most spiritually endowed, thus the chief of all things."

All that arises within Heaven and Earth belongs to the human Dao.

**Symbolic Numbers 3**
Within the numbers of Heaven and Earth, five holds the center. The images of the Charts and Writings manifest through five, and the sovereign’s ultimate position is established in five. Five is the center, and the center is the convergence of the four directions. East is Wood, West is Metal, South is Fire, North is Water—their sequence of movement is: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water. Wood and Fire are yang; Metal and Water are yin. Earth resides in the center, both yin and yang.

Their sequence of generation is: Water, Wood, Fire, Metal, Earth. Water and Wood are yang; Fire and Metal are yin. Heaven generates Water with one, and Earth completes it with six, thus in the *River Chart*, one and six occupy the North as Water. Earth generates Fire with two, and Heaven completes it with seven, thus in the *River Chart*, two and seven occupy the South as Fire. Heaven generates Wood with three, and Earth completes it with eight, thus in the *River Chart*, three and eight occupy the East as Wood. Earth generates Metal with four, and Heaven completes it with nine, thus in the *River Chart*, four and nine occupy the West as Metal. Heaven generates Earth with five, and Earth completes it with ten, thus in the *River Chart*, five and ten occupy the center as Earth, interpenetrating the four qi and serving as their pivot.

Thus, the images of the Five Phases appear in Heaven, while their essences reside in Earth. Humanity, modeled after Heaven and Earth, possesses life, embodies the five qi to form its shape, and receives the five natures to perfect its virtue. Therefore, those who discourse on human nature and the Dao invariably trace their origins here. Those who attain the correct and unobstructed flow of qi become sages or worthies; those who receive its bias and blockage become fools or the unworthy.

Yet the customs of the five directions each follow their partial perspectives. Their desires and preferences also differ. The East is the land of generation, where the sun rises, so its people are accustomed to witnessing birth, giving rise to the Laoist doctrine of longevity. The West is the land of harvest, where the sun sets, so its people are accustomed to witnessing death, giving rise to the Buddhist doctrine of quiescent extinction. The South is bright and flourishing, where yang expands and spiritual numinosity manifests. The North is dark and shadowed, where yin contracts and ghosts and spirits appear.

Only the sage stands at the center of the world, stabilizing the people of the four seas, governing by turning toward the light. Without deliberation, without action, serene and unmoving, yet responding and penetrating the world’s affairs—this is the utmost spirit of the world. Master Zhou said: "The sage establishes the human ultimate by fixing it in centrality, uprightness, humaneness, and rightness, and by making quiescence its master."

**Symbolic Numbers 4**
Master Zhou said: "Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth. The five qi are distributed in order, and the four seasons proceed. The Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity. The true essence of Non-Polarity and the refined essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal. The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female. The two qi interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things ceaselessly generate, and their transformations are inexhaustible. Only humanity receives their finest essence and is most spiritually endowed. Once the form is born, the spirit issues forth in awareness; the five natures are stirred, and good and evil diverge, giving rise to the ten thousand affairs. The sage establishes the human ultimate by fixing it in centrality, uprightness, humaneness, and rightness, and by making quiescence its master. The noble person cultivates this and prospers; the petty person violates it and meets misfortune. How great is the *Yi*! This is its ultimate."

**Symbolic Numbers 5**
To the right, the five and ten of the center intersect with the numbers of the Nine Palaces, which are the numbers of the *Luo Writing*. One, three, nine, and seven are the numbers of Heaven. Heaven’s numbers are odd; the image of the odd is round. They participate in threes, their sequence moving leftward, beginning with one, residing in the true North. One times three is three, so three follows in the true East. Three times three is nine, so nine follows in the true South. Three times nine is twenty-seven, so seven follows in the true West. Three times seven is twenty-one, returning to one.

Two, four, eight, and six are the numbers of Earth. Earth’s numbers are even; the image of the even is square. They pair in twos, their sequence moving rightward, starting from the Southwest. Two times two is four, so four follows in the Southeast. Two times four is eight, so eight follows in the Northeast. Two times eight is sixteen, so six follows in the Northwest. Two times six is twelve, returning to two.

This is the wondrous natural movement of yin and yang, left and right. Yet two, seven, four, and nine shift positions, differing from the *River Chart*. The *Inner Canon* states: "Heaven’s numbers begin with one and end with nine. One is Heaven, two is Earth, three is humanity. Three makes Heaven, three makes Earth, three makes humanity. Three times three is nine, and nine divides into the nine regions: the true North is Jizhou (present-day Dadu, Yannan, Hejian, Pingyang, and other circuits); the true East is Qingzhou (present-day Yidu, Yimi, Dengzhou, Laizhou, and other prefectures); the true South is Yangzhou (present-day the Two Huai, Two Zhe, Jiangdong, Jiangxi, Ou, and Min regions); the true West is Liangzhou (present-day Sichuan, Yunnan, and other regions); the center is Yuzhou (present-day Henan, Xiangyang, and other regions); the Northeast is Yanzhou (present-day Jinan, Dongping, Dongchang, Jining, and other regions); the Southeast is Xuzhou (present-day Xu, Peng, Su, Bo, and other prefectures); the Southwest is Jingzhou (present-day Jingzhou, Tanzhou, Huguang, and other regions); the Northwest is Yongzhou (present-day Shaanxi, Gansu, and other regions)."

Thus, Yu the Great distinguished them and composed the *Tribute*, and Jizi unfolded them in the *Hongfan*. Other systems—such as those of cosmic qi, Taiyi, yin-yang, and medicine—though varying in purity and mixture, all ultimately derive from these numbers of the Nine Palaces.

In the right diagram, the numbers one, three, five, seven, and nine are present, and within them lie the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams. The yang leads while the yin responds; the yang is solid while the yin is hollow. Though the Modes are two, they are in truth three; though the Images are four, they are in truth five; though the Trigrams are eight, they are in truth nine. From this, we see that in the realm of heaven and earth, nothing is born without yang, and nothing is completed without yin—this is the fundamental origin of creation’s natural processes.

**Image and Number Six**
This depicts the fifteen generative and consummate images of the River Chart and the Luo Writing. As the *Tradition* states: "The River yields the Chart, the Luo yields the Writing, and the sage takes them as models." To "take as models" is to emulate their images and numbers. Numbers begin with one; through minor evolution, they form five, and through major evolution, they form ten. Five and ten are the culmination of numbers, while the Chart and Writing rely on the great origin of numbers and serve as the standard for trigram configurations. This image, with its fifteen numbers in vertical and horizontal alignment, precisely embodies the central symbol of the River Chart, where heaven’s five multiplies earth’s ten.

Within it lies the *Yi*, that is, the center of the five in the Chart and Writing. When active, yang ascends to align with heaven, its image being ☰; when still, yin descends to align with earth, its image being ☷. Heaven below generates ☳ as yin-yang, while earth above generates ☶ as softness and hardness—these correspond to the upper, lower, left, and right of the five in the Chart and Writing. Their numbers are yang one and yin four, hardness three and softness two. Evolving further, they become one-six, two-seven, three-eight, and four-nine, which correspond to the four cardinal directions—east, west, south, and north—in the Chart and Writing. Divided, they form the Eight Trigrams; combined, they form the Five Phases. In the generation of the Five Phases, each retains its nature.

This diagram’s images trace their origins to generation, the River Chart’s positions reflect their flourishing, and the Luo Writing’s positions encompass their transformations, while the *Great Evolution* reveals their essence. In the River Chart, wood is east, fire south, metal west, and water north—this is the norm. In the Luo Writing, metal and fire exchange positions, with metal in the south and fire in the west—this is the transformation.

Regarding the sequence of initial generation: Kan (☵) and Xun (☴) arise from earth’s hardness, which Master Zhu called "lesser yang." Lesser yang’s position is *yin* (寅), corresponding to spring, its number three. Through minor evolution to five, it gains two; through major evolution to ten, it gains seven. Two and seven represent fire, so fire is born in *yin* and flourishes in *wu* (午). Consulting the River Chart, one and seven occupy the south, while Qian (☰) and Dui (☱) hold their positions. Qian is seven, Dui is two. Qian and Dui arise from heaven’s yang, which Master Zhu called "greater yang." Greater yang’s position is *si* (巳), the culmination of six yang. In time, this is summer; its number is one. Through minor evolution to five, it gains four; through major evolution to ten, it gains nine. Four and nine represent metal, so metal is born in *si* and flourishes in *you* (酉). Consulting the River Chart, four and nine occupy the west, while Xun (☴) and Kan (☵) hold their positions. Xun is four, Kan is nine.

Qian interacts with Kan, and Kan interacts with Qian; Xun exchanges with Dui, and Dui exchanges with Xun. Li (☲) and Zhen (☳) arise from heaven’s yin, which Master Zhu called "lesser yin." Lesser yin’s position is *shen* (申), corresponding to autumn; its number is four. Through minor evolution to five, it gains one; through major evolution to ten, it gains six. One and six represent water, so water is born in *shen* and flourishes in *zi* (子). Consulting the River Chart, one and six occupy the north, while Kun (☷) and Gen (☶) hold their positions. Gen is one, Kun is six. Kun and Gen arise from earth’s softness, which Master Zhu called "greater yin." Greater yin’s position is *hai* (亥), the culmination of six yin. In time, this is winter; its number is two. Through minor evolution to five, it gains three; through major evolution to ten, it gains eight. Three and eight represent wood, so wood is born in *hai* and flourishes in *mao* (卯). Consulting the River Chart, three and eight occupy the east, while Li (☲) and Zhen (☳) hold their positions. Zhen is three, Li is eight.

Kun interacts with Li, and Li interacts with Kun; Zhen exchanges with Gen, and Gen exchanges with Zhen. Thus, the prior-heaven images derive from the Chart: Qian seven and Dui two occupy the hard positions, while Li eight and Zhen three occupy the soft positions—heaven’s Four Images interact with earth. Kun six and Gen one occupy the yin positions, while Kan nine and Xun four occupy the yang positions—earth’s Four Images interact with heaven.

The posterior-heaven images derive from the Chart: Qian and Dui arise from heaven’s yang, with Qian one and Dui nine summing to ten (Qian at one, Dui at nine). Li and Gen arise from heaven’s yin, with Zhen reversed as Gen. Li seven and Gen three sum to ten (Li at seven, Gen at three). Kun and Zhen arise from earth’s softness, with Gen reversed as Zhen. Kun two and Zhen eight sum to ten (Kun at two, Zhen at eight). Kan and Xun arise from earth’s hardness, with Kan six and Xun four summing to ten (Kan at six, Xun at four). In the present posterior-heaven diagram, Xun is two and Kun is four—what Master Shao referred to as "the eldest daughter replacing the mother."

When the prior and posterior heaven’s images and numbers intermingle, the diagrams and trigrams truly reveal their profound significance.

*Yixiang Tushuo Waipian*, Volume One, concludes.

**Trigram and Line One**
Right: Diagram of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Six Positions.

The *Commentary* states: In ancient times, when the sages composed the *Yi*, they sought to align with the principles of nature and destiny. Thus, they established the Dao of heaven as yin and yang, the Dao of earth as softness and hardness, and the Dao of humanity as benevolence and righteousness. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Yi* forms hexagrams with six lines. Dividing yin and yang, alternating softness and hardness, the *Yi* completes its patterns with six positions.

The right diagram shows heaven’s yin and yang divided into Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen; earth’s softness and hardness divided into Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun. Together, the Two Modes, Four Images, and Eight Trigrams constitute the six positions. Above and below, left and right intersect: Qian below joins Kun, Xun above joins Zhen, Li below joins Kan, and Gen above joins Dui. Humans stand amidst this qi-interchange, observing the qi of heaven and earth, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams to form their bodies, while principle is also bestowed upon them. The round head, positioned above, corresponds to Qian; the hollow abdomen, capacious, corresponds to Kun; the limbs, moving and acting, correspond to Zhen and Xun. Li governs sight in the eyes, Kan excels in hearing in the ears, Dui enables speech in the mouth, and Gen resides silently in the nose. The eyes and mouth, being yang, receive heaven’s qi and thus are active. The ears and nose, being yin, receive earth’s qi and thus are still. This is what is meant by obtaining this qi to become this form.

Knowledge emulates heaven’s yang, corresponding to Kan in the hexagrams—water governs knowledge. Benevolence emulates heaven’s yin, corresponding to Gen—mountains govern benevolence. Ritual follows earth’s softness, corresponding to Li—fire governs ritual. Righteousness follows earth’s hardness, corresponding to Dui—metal governs righteousness. This is what is meant by obtaining this principle to become this nature.

Yet, having this form and possessing this principle, humans cannot be without desires. The eyes seek beauty, the ears seek sound, the mouth seeks flavor, the nose seeks scent, and the four limbs seek comfort and ease. Desires stir, emotions prevail, love and aversion contend, and from this arise fortune and misfortune. The sages, aligning with the principles of nature and destiny, composed the *Yi* to teach people to cultivate their virtue and expand their endeavors.

Gazing upward, they observed the images of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, the changes of cold, heat, day, and night. Looking downward, they examined the forms of mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, the transformations of water, fire, earth, and stone. Rain, dew, wind, and thunder, the swirling of wandering qi, the flight of birds and movement of beasts, the myriad things flowing into form—above and below, ascent and descent, closure and openness—these they harmonized with the Five Constants and rectified with the Five Affairs. Works such as the *Yi*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Songs*, *Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Rites*, and *Music* are how the sages encompassed the Dao of heaven and earth and assisted in the transformation and nurturing of all things.

**Hexagram and Line Two**
Right: Diagram of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Six Nodes.

The qi of the four seasons arises from Qian and Kun, opening and closing, movement and stillness, yin and yang, ascent and descent, waxing and waning. At the winter solstice, yin reaches its extreme and generates yang; at the summer solstice, yang reaches its extreme and generates yin—this is the union of Qian and Kun, yin and yang. At the autumnal equinox, yin is at its midpoint, Kun closes; at the vernal equinox, yang is at its midpoint, Qian opens. The two solstices of winter and summer are the union of yin and yang; the two equinoxes of spring and autumn are the separation of yin and yang. Examining the diagram, this meaning is clearly visible.

Thus, measuring the hexagram lines and verifying them against the celestial seasons: the thirty days before and after the winter solstice form one node (from *Xiaoxue* to *Dahan*); the sixty days before the vernal equinox form one node (*Dahan* to the vernal equinox); the sixty days after form another node (vernal equinox to *Xiaoman*). The thirty days before and after the summer solstice form one node (*Xiaoman* to *Dashu*); the sixty days before the autumnal equinox form one node (*Dashu* to the autumnal equinox); the sixty days after form another node (autumnal equinox to *Xiaoxue*). Six times six make three hundred and sixty days.

The outer trigrams—Xun (warmth), Qian (heat), Zhen (cold), and Kun (chill)—are the proper qi of heaven and earth’s four seasons. The central trigrams—Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui—correspond to rain, sunshine, warmth, cold, and wind, the wandering qi of heaven and earth’s four seasons. When the wandering qi swirls in disorder, uneven and irregular, and the five arrive in their proper seasons, the hundred grains mature, the myriad grasses flourish in response, and auspicious omens manifest. When they reach extremes of excess or deficiency, the hundred grains fail to mature, and inauspicious omens appear. Only when the sage occupies his position, achieving harmony and balance to fulfill his nurturing role, do the Five Affairs align and heaven and humanity respond—so subtle is the resonance.

The *Inner Canon* states: Responding to heaven’s qi, it moves without ceasing. Cold, heat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire are heaven’s yin and yang, which humans uphold with the three yin and three yang. Responding to earth’s qi, it remains still and guards its position, which humans emulate below with the five viscera and six bowels. The Five Movements circulate, giving rise to excesses and deficiencies; the Six Qi ascend and descend, producing counterflow, dominance, and retaliation. What is meant by "remaining still and guarding its position" refers to the annual host qi, the earth qi of each day, and the daily qi. Each qi governs sixty days and eighty-seven and a half ke. From *Dahan* to the vernal equinox, *Jueyin* wind-wood is the first qi—wind qi flows, and the myriad things arise. From the vernal equinox to *Xiaoman*, *Shaoyin* sovereign fire is the second qi...

**Hexagram and Line Three**

Here is the translation:

---

The diagram above illustrates the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Six Configurations.

The *Book of Changes* states: "When Qian and Kun are arrayed, the *Changes* are established between them." This principle is fulfilled in humanity, for humans receive the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the Five Phases to form their bodies. In essence, the human body mirrors heaven and earth. The back faces yang, the abdomen yin; the head is round, symbolizing the odd, while the orifices are yin, symbolizing the even. The upper half of the body corresponds to heaven, the lower half to earth.

The *Du Mai* (Governor Vessel) is a yang meridian, originating at the *Xiajī* point, ascending along the spine to *Fengfu*, and entering the brain. The *Chong Mai* (Thoroughfare Vessel) is a yin meridian, arising at *Qichong*, running alongside the *Shaoyin* channel, flanking the navel upward to disperse in the chest.

Thus, in the diagram, the right image—from the middle line of *Xun* to the upper line of *Qian*—represents the body from the corpse to the crown, tracing the path of the *Du Mai*. From the middle line of *Zhen* to the lower line of *Kun*, it symbolizes the chest to the lower abdomen, marking the course of the *Chong Mai*.

The *Inner Canon* states: the back is yang, and within yang, the heart is yang—*Li* represents heart-fire. The back is yang, and within yang, the lung is yin—*Dui* represents lung-metal. The heart and lungs reside above, their positions elevated, corresponding to *Li* and *Dui*. The abdomen is yin, and within yin, the kidney is yin—*Kan* represents kidney-water. The abdomen is yin, and within yin, the liver is yang—*Gen* reversed to *Zhen* represents liver-wood. The kidneys and liver lie below, their positions low, corresponding to *Kan* and *Gen*. The spleen, the supreme yin within the central region, thus occupies the middle.

All these reflect the mutual resonance of yin and yang, exterior and interior, aligning with heaven’s yin and yang. The *Sanjiao* (Triple Burner) has a name but no form, serving as the thoroughfare for all qi. The *Spiritual Pivot* states: the upper burner is like mist, irrigating the channels; the middle burner is like a fermentation vat, ripening water and grain; the lower burner is like a drainage ditch, storing water in the bladder.

If one can harmonize the Five Qi to nurture life, balance the Five Flavors to nourish the body, clarify the Five Natures to perfect virtue, and follow the Five Constants to practice the Dao, then one may assist in the work of creation and transformation. Such is called "fulfilling one’s form." Thus it is said: humanity embodies the virtue of heaven and earth, the union of yin and yang, the convergence of ghosts and spirits, and the essence of the Five Phases.

Master Chengzi said: "People of the world strive to exhaust the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad phenomena, yet few know to return to the five viscera, six bowels, hair, sinews, and bones within themselves. The good learner draws from their own body alone." Observing heaven and earth through one’s own body—this is the meaning.

*The Diagram of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Six Meridians*

In the diagram above, summerheat, heat, and dryness—three qi—connect to heaven and pertain to fire. Dampness, cold, and wind—three qi—connect to earth and pertain to water. Summerheat is the flourishing of yang, *Qian*; *Qian* is great red, the color of fire. Heat is the transformation of fire, *Li*. Dryness is the mutation of yang, *Zhen*; *Zhen* governs decisiveness and dryness. Dampness is the flourishing of yin, *Kun*. Cold is the transformation of water, *Kan*. Wind is the mutation of yin, *Xun*.

The heart, lungs, and pericardium reside above, belonging to the hand meridians. From *Wu* to *Hai*, the six yin arise above and descend. The liver, spleen, and kidneys lie below, belonging to the foot meridians. From *Zi* to *Si*, the six yang arise below and ascend. The upper [pulses] diagnose the exterior, the floating [pulses] diagnose qi; the lower [pulses] diagnose the interior, the deep [pulses] diagnose blood—thus the essentials of diagnosis may be known.

Cold, summerheat, dryness, dampness, wind, and fire are the six qi of heaven. Pungent, sweet, salty, bland, sour, and bitter are the six flavors of earth. The three yin and three yang of the hands and feet are the six meridians of humanity. Humans receive the harmonious qi of heaven and earth, the form of the Five Phases’ transformation. Yin and yang, hardness and softness, gather in one body, connecting above and below to form the Three Powers. The root of generative qi lies within, called the "spiritual mechanism."

When the six qi harmonize externally and the six flavors nourish internally, with regulated daily life and moderated diet, one may attain harmony. The abode of spirit and qi becomes the master of the mechanism’s activation, ensuring bodily peace and freedom from illness. Yet when external circumstances entangle one in benefit and harm, desires deplete the center, and only then do the six qi and six flavors begin to disturb, giving rise to illness.

Cold and dampness are yin; cold damages construction and first afflicts the foot meridians below. Heat and fire are yang; heat damages qi and first afflicts the hand meridians above. Wind is the yang within yin, swift and ever-changing. When wind prevails, it harms the liver, which governs the sinews—thus spasms and convulsions are the work of wind. Dryness is the yin within yang, contracting and astringent. When dryness prevails, it harms the lungs, which govern the skin and hair—thus desiccation and cracking are the work of dryness.

Qi are overcome by flavors. The methods of treatment are as follows: for upper [disorders], induce vomiting; for lower [disorders], promote purgation; for middle [disorders], harmonize and resolve; for deficiency, tonify; for excess, drain. For neither excess nor deficiency, treat according to the meridians—these are the general principles. The details are fully expounded in the Yellow Emperor’s canon. The present record serves to demonstrate the *Book of Changes*’ universal applicability.

Master Yi Feng of the Han heard from his teacher: "Heaven and Earth establish their positions, suspend the sun and moon, array the stars, divide yin and yang, determine the four seasons, and arrange the five phases—thus revealing themselves to the sage, who names this the *Dao/Way*. The sage perceives the Dao/Way and then understands the patterns of royal governance. Therefore, he delineates the lands of the provinces, establishes ruler and minister, sets forth laws and calendars, and arrays success and failure—thus revealing them to the worthy, who names this the *classics*.

The worthy perceive the classics and then comprehend the tasks of the human Dao/Way. These are the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Changes*, *Spring and Autumn Annals*, *Rites*, and *Music*. Thus, the sage composed *Music* to emulate Heaven and instituted *Rites* to match Earth. *Music* arises from yang, while *Rites* emerge from yin. *Rites* and *Music* are the yin and yang of Heaven. The *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Songs*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals* correspond to the four seasons. When the four seasons harmonize above, the four teachings circulate throughout the state, and *Rites* and *Music* flourish.

Master Shao said: "The *Book of Changes* arose in the era of the Three Sovereigns, corresponding to spring; the *Book of Documents* arose in the era of the Five Emperors, corresponding to summer; the *Book of Songs* arose in the era of the Three Kings, corresponding to autumn; and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* arose in the era of the Five Hegemons, corresponding to winter."

I have heard from Master Qingbi Du: "The *Book of Changes* reveals the origins of *Rites* and *Music*; the *Book of Documents* records their flourishing; the *Book of Songs* conveys their transformations; and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* rescues *Rites* from death and *Music* from decay. When the Dao/Way of the Six Classics is illuminated, the Dao/Way of Heaven and humanity is complete."

Thus, the *Book of Changes* guides yin and yang; the *Book of Documents* clarifies governance and affairs; the *Book of Songs* chants human nature and emotions; and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* meticulously distinguishes good and evil. The systems of pitch standards, divination, verification, and calculation are the remnants of the *Book of Changes*. Lyrics, eulogies, songs, and satires are the offshoots of the *Book of Songs*. Edicts, memorials, discourses, and memorials to the throne are the descendants of the *Book of Documents*. Commentaries, records, biographies, and inscriptions are the extensions of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Though the five phases alternate in dominance and new works arise, how could they surpass these four? Therefore, exalting *Rites* and esteeming *Music*, dwelling in benevolence and following righteousness—these are the teachings of the former kings. Violating norms and altering the Dao/Way, seeking the obscure and practicing the bizarre—these are the harms of heterodoxies. When the teachings of the Six Classics prevail, the harms of heterodoxies cease. In the flourishing eras of the Three Dynasties, the Dao/Way of the sage-kings was luminous. At such times, how could heterodox harms arise? It is only when classical learning dims and perverse doctrines spread that they gain swift traction.

Alas! How can scholars fail to devote themselves to the root and instead indulge in chaotic debates? The failure to illuminate learning is truly lamentable.

**Hexagram and Line Six**
Right: Diagrams of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and Six Pitch Standards.

The *Image* of *Yu* (豫) states: "Thunder emerges from the earth in arousal; this is *Yu*. The former kings composed *Music* to exalt virtue, offering it reverently to the Supreme Di and matching it with ancestral spirits." When the king’s achievements are complete and governance is settled, the Three Bonds are rectified, the Nine Categories are ordered, and the hundred clans are harmonious, then *Music* is composed to propagate the qi of the eight winds. At the *Beginning of Spring*, *Gen* (艮) governs the *Tiaofeng* (条风), also called the *Rongfeng* (融风). At the *Spring Equinox*, *Zhen* (震) governs the *Mingshu Feng* (明庶风), also called the *Gufeng* (谷风). At the *Beginning of Summer*, *Xun* (巽) governs the *Qingming Feng* (清明风). At the *Summer Solstice*, *Li* (离) governs the *Jingfeng* (景风), also called the *Kaifeng* (凯风). At the *Beginning of Autumn*, *Kun* (坤) governs the *Dongfeng* (冻风). At the *Autumn Equinox*, *Dui* (兑) governs the *Wenhe Feng* (闻阖风). At the *Beginning of Winter*, *Qian* (乾) governs the *Buzhou Feng* (不周风). At the *Winter Solstice*, *Kan* (坎) governs the *Guangmo Feng* (广莫风). These winds categorize the natures of the myriad things.

The qi of Heaven and Earth interact to achieve great harmony. The responses to the arrival of qi are precise to the moment. Thus, the method of creating pitch standards begins by establishing the central tone to serve as the foundation. From there, tones are sequentially derived through mutual generation and reduction, culminating in twelve, thereby embodying the meaning of the Three Sequences.

Heaven opens at *zi* (子), which is the celestial sequence, as yang accumulates to form Heaven. Yang numbers begin at one and culminate at nine. Nine is the function of yang, so the pitch pipe of *Huangzhong* (黄钟) is nine inches and three fen in length. *Sun* (损) descends once to generate *Linzhong* (林钟) at *wei* (未). *Wei* is the opposition of *chou* (丑). Earth opens at *chou*, which is the terrestrial sequence, as yin accumulates to form Earth. Yin numbers begin at two and center at six. Six is the function of yin, so the pitch pipe of *Linzhong* is six inches and three fen in length. *Yi* (益) ascends once to generate *Taicu* (太簇) at *yin* (寅). Humanity is born at *yin*, which is the human sequence. Humanity is the intersection of yin and yang, participating in three and uniting in eight. Thus, the pitch pipe of *Taicu* is eight inches in length. Eight is what Fuxi used to draw the Eight Trigrams, aligning with Heaven and Earth and communicating with the divine luminaries.

The Three Sequences interconnect, and the Three Calendars alternate in use. Yang pitch standards take wives, and yin pitch standards bear sons. The six pitch standards and six complementary tones correspond to the twelve earthly branches, cycling through each other as the fundamental tone, their meanings endless.

The *Rites of Zhou* states: "The Grand Master oversees the six pitch standards and six complementary tones to harmonize the sounds of yin and yang." *Huangzhong* (黄钟), *Taicu* (太簇), *Guxi* (姑洗), *Ruibin* (義宾), *Yize* (夷则), and *Wuyi* (无射) are the yang sounds. *Dalü* (大吕), *Yingzhong* (应钟), *Nanlü* (南吕), *Linzhong* (林钟), *Xiaolü* (小吕), and *Jiazhong* (夹钟) are the yin sounds. The sun and moon meet twelve times, moving rightward in sequence; the sage created the six complementary tones to emulate this. The handle of the Dipper revolves through the twelve earthly branches in a leftward rotation; the sage created the six pitch standards to emulate this. The six pitch standards are yang, rotating leftward to unite with yin. The six complementary tones are yin, turning rightward to unite with yang. Those sharing the same position emulate husband and wife; those in different positions emulate mother and child. Those rooted in the *qian* (乾) lines constitute the six pitch standards.

Those rooted in the *kun* (坤) lines constitute the six complementary tones. The six pitch standards rotate leftward to generate the complementary tones, which share the same position to emulate husband and wife. The six complementary tones turn rightward to generate the pitch standards, occupying different positions to emulate mother and child. They are generated through eight divisions, emulating the eight trigrams. Rotation through five positions yields the *guan* (官), emulating the Three Powers. The Dao of yang is ever abundant: from *zi* (子) to *si* (巳), it follows the yang path, and its pipes are all long. The Dao of yin is ever deficient: from *wu* (午) to *hai* (亥), it follows the yin path, and its pipes are all short. Thus, they are modulated by the five notes—longer pipes produce lower sounds, shorter pipes produce higher sounds; lower sounds are heavy and turbid, slow and leisurely, while higher sounds are light and clear, swift and sharp.

*Gong* (宫) represents the ruler, for the ruler governs as the master, residing at the center to harmonize the four directions. As the initiating chant that engenders life, it serves as the warp of the four sounds. Thus, sound is centered in *gong*, touched in *jiao* (角), blessed in *zhi* (徵), manifested in *shang* (商), and contained in *yu* (羽). Peaceful, deep, and rich, broad and low—this is the sound of *gong*. Vigorous, congealed, bright, and distinct, descending from above to return to the center—this is the sound of *shang*. Rounded, long, and penetrating, balanced and upright—this is the sound of *jiao*. Flowing and melodious, ascending from below to return to proper balance—this is the sound of *zhi*. Faint yet far-reaching, fine and high—this is the sound of *yu*.

The *Commentary* states: Hearing the *gong* tone makes one warm and expansive; hearing the *shang* tone makes one upright and fond of righteousness; hearing the *jiao* tone makes one compassionate and loving; hearing the *zhi* tone makes one joyful in goodness and fond of giving; hearing the *yu* tone makes one orderly and fond of ritual.

*Gong* represents the ruler, *shang* the minister, *jiao* the people, *zhi* affairs, and *yu* things. *Gong* governs effortlessly to shelter all things, emulating the ruler. *Shang* acts to connect all things, emulating the minister. *Jiao* is easily provoked yet hard to govern, emulating the people. *Zhi* emerges from non-being to verify being, emulating affairs. *Yu* expands and contracts with the seasons, emulating things. *Gong* as ruler suffices to govern ministers; *shang* as minister suffices to govern the people; *jiao* as people suffices to initiate affairs; *zhi* as affairs suffices to complete things; *yu* as things suffices to serve their purpose. Such is their order.

They are rooted in the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—measured by the five norms: compass, square, weight, balance, and plumb line; rectified by the five affairs: appearance, speech, vision, hearing, and thought; disseminated through the eight sounds: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, clay, hide, and wood; and threaded by the eight trigrams. Thus, the heavenly bestowal and earthly transformation, the principles of human affairs, are complete.

The length of the *Huangzhong* (黄钟) pipe is divided into ten *fen* (分) to make one *cun* (寸), ten *cun* to make one *chi* (尺), ten *chi* to make one *zhang* (丈), and ten *zhang* to make one *yin* (引). The five measures—*fen*, *cun*, *chi*, *zhang*, and *yin*—are carefully determined to fix lengths. For measurement, the *Huangzhong* pipe is nine *cun* long, containing twelve hundred grains of black millet to form a *yue* (龠). Ten *yue* make one *ge* (合), ten *ge* make one *sheng* (升), ten *sheng* make one *dou* (斗), and ten *dou* make one *hu* (斛). The five measures—*yue*, *ge*, *sheng*, *dou*, and *hu*—are carefully determined to equalize quantities.

For weighing, the twelve hundred grains of millet in the *Huangzhong* pipe weigh twelve *zhu* (铢); two *yue* weigh twenty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the twenty-four lines of the eight trigrams. This makes one *liang* (两), sixteen *liang* make one *jin* (斤), totaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, matching the three hundred eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams. Thirty *jin* make one *jun* (钧), totaling eleven thousand five hundred twenty *zhu*, equaling the eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods of the two *Yijing* scrolls. Four *jun* make one *dan* (石). The five weights—*zhu*, *liang*, *jin*, *jun*, and *dan*—are carefully determined to balance light and heavy.

Thus, the pitch standards accord with Heaven and Earth, are rooted in yin and yang, respond to human relationships, and originate in temperament and nature. Governed by virtue and moved by music, the people are thus unified, and the world is transformed and perfected.

The *Record of Music* states: Humans receive the mean of Heaven and Earth to live, none failing to embody the essence of the Five Phases and the virtue of the Five Constants. Their transformation is achieved through nothing more than the harmony of the five sounds to express the nature of the Five Constants. Thus, hearing the *gong* tone awakens the heart of sincerity and truth as one’s nature; hearing the *zhi* tone awakens the heart of reverence and respect to become ritual; hearing the *shang* tone awakens the heart of shame and aversion to become righteousness; hearing the *yu* tone awakens the heart of right and wrong to become wisdom; hearing the *jiao* tone awakens the heart of compassion to become benevolence. In this way, music is practiced and human relationships are purified; outwardly, the ears and eyes become keen, and inwardly, the blood and qi are harmonized. Customs are transformed, and the world is at peace.

*Hexagram lines: seven. Right four images. Eight trigrams. Six canons diagram.*

The *Rites of Zhou*’s Six Ministries mirror Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons, with their three hundred sixty subordinate offices corresponding to the three hundred sixty days of the year and aligning with the three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial circuit. As the *Book of Documents* states: “In the high antiquity of Yao and Shun, offices were established, numbering only a hundred.” Within were the *Hundred Stewards* and the *Four Peaks*; without were the *Provincial Governors* and *Regional Lords*. Since the time of Zhuanxu, the Southern Director Chong was charged with Heaven, and the Northern Director Li with Earth, known as Xi and He. Yao inherited this system, commanding Xi and He to reverently observe the vast Heaven and respectfully impart the seasons to the people, restoring their former duties to oversee the affairs of Heaven and Earth. He further divided their authority, appointing Xizhong, Xishu, Hezhong, and Heshu to govern the four seasons, thus fulfilling the roles of the Six Ministers. Shun, assuming the Hundred Stewards, renamed the Ministry of Earth to *Minister of Instruction*, the Ministry of Autumn to *Minister of Justice*, the Ministry of Winter to *Minister of Works*, and the Ministry of Spring to *Minister of Rites*. The Shang dynasty’s system of the Son of Heaven’s Five Ministries included the titles *Minister of War* and *Minister of Punishments*. By the time of King Cheng of Zhou, he synthesized the Shang system and composed the *Rites of Zhou*, dividing the duties of Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons. The *Minister of Heaven* (Prime Minister) oversaw state governance, unified the hundred officials, and harmonized the four seas. The *Minister of Earth* (Minister of Instruction) managed state education, disseminated the Five Constants, and pacified the myriad people. The *Minister of Spring* (Minister of Rites) administered state rituals, harmonized the divine and the human, and reconciled high and low. The *Minister of Summer* (Minister of War) directed state administration, commanded the six armies, and pacified the feudal states. The *Minister of Autumn* (Minister of Justice) enforced state prohibitions, eradicated treachery, and punished violence and disorder. The *Minister of Winter* (Minister of Works) managed state lands, settled the four classes, and ensured timely utilization of the earth’s resources. The Six Ministers, each fulfilling their duties and leading their subordinates, enriched the lives of the people and perfected the hundred affairs. The Three Dukes—Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Protector—were established to discourse on the Dao and govern the state, harmonizing and regulating yin and yang. The Three Orphans—Junior Preceptor, Junior Tutor, and Junior Protector—assisted the Dukes in propagating transformation, reverently illuminating Heaven and Earth, without being confined to a single office. This system mirrored the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth and the cyclical movement of the four seasons. As the Zhou declined, offices were lost, and the hundred institutions fell into disrepair. During the Warring States period, each state made its own alterations. By the time of the mighty Qin, abandoning ancient models, the feudal lords were abolished and governors installed, establishing the titles of Chancellor, Censor, and Grand Commandant. From the Han onward, these changes persisted, leading to chaotic official systems, fragmented governance, and affairs lacking unity and order. Just as Heaven and Earth have four seasons, and the hundred officials have six ministries, all matters under Heaven are encompassed within, like the main threads of a net or the collar of a fur garment—though a hundred generations pass, they cannot be altered. Later rulers, in examining antiquity and rectifying names, must rely on the *Rites of Zhou*—what else could they use?

*Hexagram lines: eight. Right: Four Images, Eight Trigrams, Six Armies diagram.*

The *Commentary* states: “An army is a multitude, and a multitude must have organization.” From this organization arise the designations of *squad*, *platoon*, *company*, *battalion*, *army*, and *legion*. The Son of Heaven’s Six Armies, and the Three Armies of great states, with their regular and irregular formations and combinations, all derive from the images of the *Book of Changes*. By the Han dynasty, Zhuge Liang of Shu mastered this system and expanded it into the Eight Formations. *Heaven*, *Earth*, *Wind*, and *Cloud* correspond to the four corners of the Later Heaven arrangement; *Dragon*, *Tiger*, *Bird*, and *Serpent* correspond to the four cardinal directions. The regular formations establish the framework, while the irregular formations adapt to change. Regular and irregular mutually generate each other, forming an unbroken cycle. Round as a wheel’s hub, square as a chessboard’s layout, concealed beneath the Nine Earths, still and contracted; moving above the Nine Heavens, dynamic and expansive. Flowing without obstruction, like water; steadfast and unyielding, like a mountain. Strong, resolute, and decisive, embodying the virtue of the Lake trigram’s metal; awe-inspiring and sternly clear, reflecting the nature of the Fire trigram. Swift as thunder, the spirit of sudden arousal; dense as wind, the speed of swift movement. These eight principles are what generals must master. The *Classic of the Grasped Opportunity* states: “Four are regular, four are irregular, and the remaining odd number is the grasped opportunity.” There are nine formations, with the central position held by the commander-in-chief, from which the eight directions are regulated. Within the formations, one formation contains another; within a unit, one unit contains another. The front becomes the rear, and the rear becomes the front. Advancing, there is no reckless charge; retreating, there is no hasty flight. Four heads and eight tails, wherever engaged, become the lead. If the enemy strikes the center, both ends respond. Five men form a squad, five squads form a unit. Numbers begin with five and culminate in eight—five pertains to squad organization, while eight pertains to formation structure. Small formations consist of eight units, medium formations of sixty-four units, and large formations of five hundred twelve units. The Zhou military system organizes five men into a squad, five squads into a platoon, and four platoons into a company, totaling a hundred men. Thus, multiplying by five yields a small formation of five hundred men, a battalion. Multiplying again by five yields a medium formation of two thousand five hundred men, a legion. Multiplying once more by five yields a large formation of twelve thousand five hundred men, an army—this is the threefold multiplication by five. In the Eight Formations, five men form a squad, five squads form a unit. Multiplying by eight yields a small formation of two hundred men. Multiplying again by eight yields a medium formation of one thousand six hundred men. Multiplying once more by eight yields a large formation of twelve thousand eight hundred men—this is the threefold multiplication by eight. Sunzi said: “Governing the many is like governing the few—this is a matter of organization.” With clear organization, the more there are, the more efficiently they can be managed. The grasped opportunity corresponds to one-eighth of the whole. The *opportunity* is the central authority, like the pivot of a door, operating within yet leaving no visible trace. Thus, eight in reality becomes nine, with the commander-in-chief at the center and the eight directions arrayed around. Nine vertical and nine horizontal lines encompass the greater within the lesser, forming a camp when stationary and a formation when in motion. The Bird to the south, the Serpent to the north, the Dragon to the east, and the Tiger to the west; Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Cloud occupy the four corners. The four cardinal directions are regular, the four corners are irregular, and regular and irregular mutually generate, giving rise to inexhaustible transformations.

**Section on Degrees: The Diagram of the Celestial Revolutions and Qi-Nodes**

The *Xiang* of the *Ge* hexagram states: "Fire within the marsh: *Ge*. The noble person thereby regulates the calendar and clarifies the seasons." The transformations of the four seasons are the greatest of *Ge*’s changes. Those who regulate the calendar reckon the shifts of the sun, moon, and stars to illuminate the sequence of the four seasons—yet why is this spoken of as "fire within the marsh"?

The *Shuo Gua* says: *Li* is fire, the sun; *Dui* is the marsh, water. Yet Master Shao’s *Book of the World’s Order* assigns *Dui* to the moon and *Li* to the stars. Stars are the remnants of the sun. Thus, the two hexagrams *Li* and *Dui* contain the images of the three luminaries: sun, moon, and stars. Hence, the *Xiang* further states: "Water and fire mutually rest." Water is the moon, fire is the sun; sun and moon push one another, and brightness arises. Water is cold, fire is heat; cold and heat push one another, and the year is completed.

Of the celestial bodies that display brightness, none surpass the sun and moon. Heaven hangs forth its images, and the sage models them. Observing the sun and moon’s movements over a full year, their conjunctions form the *chen* (celestial markers), twelve in number. The calendars of former dynasties underwent countless reforms. According to the *Shoushi* calendar:

- In the first month of spring, the sun and moon conjoin at *Xuanleng*;
- In the second month, at *Zouzi*;
- In the third month, at *Jianglou*;
- In the first month of summer, at *Daliang*;
- In the second month, at *Shichen*;
- In the third month, at *Chunshou*;
- In the first month of autumn, at *Chunhuo*;
- In the second month, at *Chunwei*;
- In the third month, at *Shouxing*;
- In the first month of winter, at *Dahuo*;
- In the second month, at *Ximu*;
- In the third month, at *Xingji*—twelve *chen* in all.

According to the *Monthly Ordinances*, in the first month of spring, the sun resides in *Yingshi*, and the Dipper’s handle points to *yin*; thus, *yin* aligns with *hai*. In the second month, the sun resides in *Jianglou*, and the Dipper’s handle points to *mao*; thus, *mao* aligns with *xu*. The remaining months follow in sequence. Yet as the sun and moon’s movements now differ, the established *chen* no longer align. To rely on ancient methods of qi-observation for pitch-pipe tuning may prove incompatible.

The lodgings traversed number twenty-eight:
- The Eastern Azure Dragon’s seven lodges: *Jiao*, *Kang*, *Di*, *Fang*, *Xin*, *Wei*, *Ji*;
- The Northern Dark Warrior’s seven lodges: *Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, *Wei*, *Shi*, *Bi*;
- The Western White Tiger’s seven lodges: *Kui*, *Lou*, *Wei*, *Mao*, *Bi*, *Zi*, *Shen*;
- The Southern Vermilion Bird’s seven lodges: *Jing*, *Gui*, *Liu*, *Xing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, *Zhen*—these are the twenty-eight lodges.

The degrees traversed number 365¼. Heaven has no inherent degrees; degrees arise from the sun’s movement. The twenty-eight lodges vary in breadth, for the sun’s path differs in depth. The Eastern lodges span seventy-five degrees; the Northern, ninety-eight; the Western, eighty; the Southern, one hundred twelve. Together, they total 365 degrees. From this, the four seasons are ordered, the eight nodes established, the twelve months built, the twenty-four qi divided, the seventy-two seasonal markers fixed, and the 365¼ days set as the year’s completion.

The *Book of Changes* encompasses the transformations of Heaven and Earth without overreach. The *Changes* has four images corresponding to the four seasons: *shaoyang* for spring, *taiyang* for summer, *shaoyin* for autumn, *taiyin* for winter. The *Changes* has eight trigrams corresponding to the eight nodes: *Lì* for the Beginning of Spring, *Zhèn* for the Spring Equinox, *Xùn* for the Beginning of Summer, *Lí* for the Summer Solstice, *Kūn* for the Beginning of Autumn, *Duì* for the Autumn Equinox, *Qián* for the Beginning of Winter, *Kǎn* for the Winter Solstice. The eight trigrams correspond to the eight nodes.

The trigrams have twelve sovereign hexagrams corresponding to the twelve *chen*:
- *Fù* for the eleventh month,
- *Lín* for the twelfth,
- *Tài* for the first,
- *Dà Zhuàng* for the second,
- *Gòu* for the third,
- *Qián* for the fourth,
- *Gòu* for the fifth,
- *Dùn* for the sixth,
- *Pǐ* for the seventh,
- *Guān* for the eighth,
- *Bō* for the ninth,
- *Kūn* for the tenth—these are the twelve sovereign hexagrams.

The eight trigrams’ twenty-four lines correspond to the twenty-four qi; the sovereign hexagrams’ seventy-two lines correspond to the seventy-two seasonal markers; the twenty-eight reversed hexagrams correspond to the twenty-eight lodges; the sixty-four hexagrams’ 384 lines match the year’s days, corresponding to the 365 degrees of the celestial circuit.

Thus, one treads at the beginning, aligns the standard at the center, returns the surplus at the end, harmonizes qi, conjunctions, emptiness, and fullness—and intercalary months arise.

The *Commentary* states: "The sun and moon’s movements bring one cold, one heat." The *Great Plan* states: "The sun and moon’s movements give rise to winter and summer."

At the winter solstice, the sun travels through the northern quarter and brings cold; at the summer solstice, the sun travels through the southern quarter and brings heat. In spring, it travels through the western quarter, and in autumn, through the eastern quarter—thus day and night are balanced, and warmth and frost are equal. Therefore, the *Fengxiang* officials measure the sun in winter and summer, and the moon in spring and autumn, to distinguish the subtleties of the four seasons.

The method for measuring the sun involves erecting an eight-foot gnomon upon the earth, with four corners and four centers, and drawing the red path of the eight *jin* states. When the sun enters north of the ecliptic, it is called the Black Path. In spring, the moon travels east of the ecliptic, called the Blue-Green Path; when it enters west of the ecliptic, it is called the White Path. In winter, the moon travels north of the ecliptic, called the Black Path; when it enters south of the ecliptic, it is called the Red Path. In autumn, the moon travels west of the ecliptic, called the White Path; when it enters east of the ecliptic, it is called the Blue-Green Path. None of these follow the correct path, hence it is said: if the sun departs from the Yang Path, drought follows; if it departs from the Yin Path, rain follows. Only when it travels along the ecliptic does it follow the correct path.

Zheng Kangcheng stated: "At the spring equinox, the sun is in *Lou*; at the autumn equinox, the sun is in *Jiao*. The moon’s crescents appear in *Qianniu* and *Dongjing*, and by observing their shadows, one knows whether the qi have arrived or not." The *Hexagram Verifications* states: "The verification of the eight trigrams’ qi does not occur at the full moon but begins with the month. On the eighth day, the first quarter appears; before the eighth day ends, the last quarter appears. By observing the hexagrams’ qi, the Yin qi is properly aligned and balanced." From this, it follows that measuring the moon’s shadow also uses these days. For example, when the spring equinox sun is in *Lou*, the moon’s first quarter is in *Dongjing*, and its last quarter is in *Qianniu*. When the autumn equinox sun is in *Jiao*, the first quarter is in *Qianniu*, and the last quarter is in *Dongjing*. This is because at the spring equinox, the *Lou* star is in the west at dusk, and at the autumn equinox, the *Jiao* star is in the west at dusk. By this reasoning, the *Monthly Ordinances*’ mid-stars can all be known. Nowadays, the spring equinox sun is in *Bi*, and the autumn equinox sun is in *Han*, so the moon’s crescents appear between *Shen*, *Jing*, *Ji*, and *Dou*—this discrepancy arises from the precession of the equinoxes.

According to the *Shoushi Calendar*: At the winter solstice, the sun is at eight degrees in *Ji*, rising at the first quarter of *Chen* and setting at the third quarter of *Shen*. At the lesser cold, the sun is at fourteen degrees in *Dou*, rising at the beginning of *Chen* and setting at the fourth quarter of *Shen*. At the greater cold, the sun is at the first degree in *Nü*, rising at the fourth quarter of *Mao* and setting at the beginning of *You*. At the beginning of spring, the sun is at five degrees in *Xu*, rising at the third quarter of *Mao* and setting at the first quarter of *You*. At rain water, the sun is at ten degrees in *Wei*, rising at the second quarter of *Mao* and setting at the second quarter of *You*. At the awakening of insects, the sun is at eleven degrees in *Shi*, rising at the first quarter of *Mao* and setting at the third quarter of *You*. At the spring equinox, the sun is at eight degrees in *Bi*, rising at the fourth quarter of *Mao* and setting at the beginning of *You*. At pure brightness, the sun is at fourteen degrees in *Kui*, rising at the third quarter of *Mao* and setting at the first quarter of *You*. At grain rain, the sun is at ten degrees in *Lou*, rising at the second quarter of *Mao* and setting at the second quarter of *You*. At the beginning of summer, the sun is at twelve degrees in *Wei*, rising at the first quarter of *Mao* and setting at the fourth quarter of *Xu*. At lesser fullness, the sun is at one degree in *Bi*, rising at the fourth quarter of *Yin* and setting at the beginning of *Xu*. At grain in ear, the sun is at fifteen degrees in *Bi*, rising at the third quarter of *Yin* and setting at the beginning of *Xu*. At the summer solstice, the sun is at three degrees in *Jing*, rising at the third quarter of *Yin* and setting at the first quarter of *Xu*. At lesser heat, the sun is at eighteen degrees in *Jing*, rising at the fourth quarter of *Yin* and setting at the beginning of *Xu*. At greater heat, the sun is at the first degree in *Liu*, rising at the beginning of *Mao* and setting at the fourth quarter of *You*. At the beginning of autumn, the sun is at one degree in *Xing*, rising at the first quarter of *Mao* and setting at the third quarter of *You*. At the end of heat, the sun is at nine degrees in *Zhang*, rising at the second quarter of *Mao* and setting at the second quarter of *You*. At white dew, the sun is at ten degrees in *Yi*, rising at the third quarter of *Mao* and setting at the first quarter of *You*. At the autumn equinox, the sun is at one degree in *Kang*, rising at the fourth quarter of *Mao* and setting at the beginning of *You*. At cold dew, the sun is at seventeen degrees in *Gan*, rising at the first quarter of *Mao* and setting at the third quarter of *You*. At frost descent, the sun is at two degrees in *Kang*, rising at the second quarter of *Mao* and setting at the second quarter of *You*. At the beginning of winter, the sun is at seven degrees in *Di*, rising at the third quarter of *Mao* and setting at the first quarter of *You*. At lesser snow, the sun is at the first degree in *Xin*, rising at the beginning of *Chen* and setting at the fourth quarter of *Shen*. At greater snow, the sun is at ten degrees in *Wei*, rising at the first quarter of *Chen* and setting at the third quarter of *Shen*. These are the lengths of day and night in *ke* units.

The qi of heaven and earth circulate through the six directions. When the sun departs, the moon arrives; when cold departs, heat arrives. In the previous diagram, the round and square images establish the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams intermingle left and right, one moving forward and one backward, Yin and Yang mutually propelling. One departs, one arrives. Yang is day, warmth, and heat; Yin is night, frost, and cold. Day and night interact, and the myriad things are born; cold and heat alternate, and the four seasons are completed. Thus, five days make a *hou*, three *hou* make a *qi*, six *qi* make a season, and four seasons make a year. One year has twenty-four *qi*, hence the eight trigrams have twenty-four lines, each line corresponding to one *qi*. The lower trigram of the eight trigrams is *zhen*, and the upper trigram is *hui*; their lines correspond as follows: the first with the fourth, the second with the fifth, and the third with the top.

The winter solstice begins with the first nine of *Fu* (☳ below ☷ above). One Yang moves beneath the double Yin, where Yin is abundant and Yang is faint. Taking the ten parts before and after, one Yang corresponds to nine Yin. Considering the two *qi* before and after together, the winter solstice includes lesser snow, greater snow, lesser cold, and greater cold, along with its own position—five *qi* in total, corresponding to ten lines. The same applies to the other *qi*. Thus, nights are long and days are short, and the heavenly qi reaches its extreme cold at this time. The second and third sixes, with all corresponding lines as Yin, represent lesser cold and greater cold, where the extreme accumulation of Yin cold gives rise to the spring qi.

The beginning of spring starts with the first nine of *Bi* (☲ below ☶ above). Taking the ten parts before and after, three Yang correspond to seven Yin, so the qi gradually warms.

The sixth one and first nine correspond to Rain Water and Awakening of Insects. The spring equinox centers on the first nine of *Jie* (☱ below ☵ above), where Yin and Yang are evenly balanced. Taking the ten parts before and after, five Yang correspond to five Yin, and the heavenly *qi* reaches harmony and warmth at this time, with day and night equal in length. The second nine and third six correspond to Pure Brightness and Grain Rain, where accumulated warmth generates heat and the summer *qi* responds.

The beginning of summer arises from the first nine of *Xiao Xu* (☰ below ☴ above). Taking the ten parts before and after, seven Yang correspond to three Yin, and the climate trends toward heat. The first nine and third nine correspond to Grain Full and Grain in Ear, when the heavenly *qi* is intensely hot.

The summer solstice reaches the first six of *Gou* (☴ below ☰ above), where one Yin arises beneath the double Yang. With Yang abundant and Yin scarce, taking the ten parts before and after, one Yin corresponds to nine Yang. Thus, days are long and nights are short, and the heavenly *qi* reaches its extreme heat at this time. The second nine and third nine, with all corresponding lines as firm, represent lesser heat and greater heat, where the extreme accumulation of heat transforms into the autumn *qi*.

The beginning of autumn arises from the first six of *Kun* (☵ below ☱ above). Taking the ten parts before and after, three Yin correspond to seven Yang, and the heavenly *qi* gradually cools. The second nine and third six correspond to End of Heat and White Dew.

The autumn equinox centers on the first six of *Lü* (☶ below ☲ above), where firm and yielding are evenly divided. Taking the ten parts before and after, five Yin correspond to five Yang, and the heavenly *qi* reaches clarity and coolness at this time, with day and night equal in length. The second six and third nine correspond to Cold Dew and Frost Descent, where extreme clarity turns to cold and the winter *qi* responds.

The beginning of winter arises from the first six of *Yu* (☷ below ☳ above). Taking the ten parts before and after, seven Yin correspond to three Yang, and the heavenly *qi* trends toward cold. The second six and third six correspond to lesser snow and greater snow, where the extreme accumulation of Yin *qi* gives rise to one Yang reborn below.

Like a ring without end, it cycles and begins anew. Thus, the eight trigrams interact, one correct and eight changing, and the sixty-four hexagrams revolve in circular flow, completing the celestial degrees. The circular diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams is shown in the inner chapter.

According to *Fu*, *Gou*, *Jie*, *Lü*, *Bi*, *Xiao Xu*, *Kun*, and *Yu*—all in the eight trigram palaces—these are the first-generation hexagrams. *Fu* and *Gou* correspond to the two solstices, where Qian and Kun transform by their first lines. *Jie* and *Lü* correspond to the two equinoxes, where Kan and Li transform by their first lines. *Bi* corresponds to the beginning of spring, where Gen transforms by its first line. *Xiao Xu* corresponds to the beginning of summer, where Xun transforms by its first line. *Kun* corresponds to the beginning of autumn, where Dui transforms by its first line. *Yu* corresponds to the beginning of winter, where Zhen transforms by its first line.

The two solstices and two equinoxes, transformed by Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, are the four unchanging cardinal hexagrams. The four beginnings, transformed by Gen, Xun, Dui, and Zhen, are the four mutable corner hexagrams. Moreover, in the *Yi*, only these eight hexagrams have the first and fourth lines responding in Yin and Yang, while the second and fifth, third and sixth lines do not respond. Thus, the year has twenty-four solar terms, yet the nodes are limited to eight.

Diagram of degrees and measurements, right.
Square earth diagram of ten thousand *li* feudal domains.

The *Xiang* (Image) of *Bi* (Union) states: "Water upon the earth—this is *Bi*. The former kings established the myriad states and drew the feudal lords close."

The king demarcates and governs the realm, enfeoffing states to shield the royal house and foster kinship with the lords—thus uniting all under heaven. The systems of Xia and Yin, however, can no longer be verified. Now, following the *Rites of Zhou*, we distinguish directions and rectify positions, examining the texts on state structure and rural administration. We diagram the royal domain of a thousand *li*, along with the systems of *xiang*, *sui*, *du*, *bi*, *dian*, *shao*, *xian*, and *hua*, while the feudal lords are enfeoffed according to the nine ranks of *hou*, *dian*, *nan*, *cai*, *wei*, *yao*, *yi*, *zhen*, and *fan*, their proximity and distance thus made manifest.

The *Subcommentary* states: In an era of great peace, the land spans ten thousand *li*, with the Central Kingdom measuring seven thousand. In an age of moderate peace, the lands of Yi and Di extend to seven thousand, while the Central Kingdom spans five thousand. In a declining age, the lands of Yi and Di measure five thousand, and the Central Kingdom three thousand. Thus, *Mencius* speaks of nine regions within the seas, each a thousand *li* square, with dukes and marquises enfeoffed in domains of a hundred *li*, earls seventy *li*, and viscounts and barons fifty *li*—three grades of land division. This was the system of Xia and Yin, which the early Zhou inherited. When the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, he expanded the Nine Provinces, granting domains of five hundred *li* to meritorious dukes, four hundred *li* to marquises, three hundred *li* to earls, two hundred *li* to viscounts, and a hundred *li* to barons. Those whose domains fell short of a hundred *li* were attached to the lords as dependencies.

The *Royal Regulations* states: Each province establishes two hundred and ten states, so eight provinces comprise one thousand six hundred and eighty states—a rough approximation. The Grand Minister of Works, using the method of the *tu gui* (earth gnomon), measures the depth of the soil, aligns the sun’s shadow, and seeks the center of the earth. Where the sun is to the south, the shadow is short and the heat intense; where it is to the north, the shadow is long and the cold severe. Where it is to the east, the shadow falls in the evening and winds prevail; where it is to the west, the shadow appears in the morning and yin dominates. When the shadow at the solstice measures one foot and five inches, this is called the "earth’s center," where heaven and earth unite, the four seasons converge, wind and rain gather, and yin and yang harmonize. Only then do the myriad things flourish, and the royal domain is established.

Right: On measuring the earth’s center and establishing the royal domain.

The *tu gui* is made of jade, one foot and five inches long, used to measure the depth of the soil and the length of the sun’s shadow. Formerly, the Duke of Zhou measured the earth’s center at Yangcheng in Yingchuan, erecting an eight-foot gnomon. At noon on the summer solstice, the shadow north of the gnomon measured one foot and five inches, matching the *tu gui*, thus determining the earth’s center as the central marker. A thousand *li* south of the central marker, another gnomon was placed as the southern marker. At noon on the summer solstice, the shadow north of this gnomon measured one foot and four inches—one inch shorter—indicating a hotter region. A thousand *li* north of the central marker, another gnomon was placed as the northern marker. At noon on the summer solstice, the shadow north of this gnomon measured one foot and six inches—one inch longer—indicating a colder region. A thousand *li* east of the central marker, another gnomon was placed as the eastern marker. Here, the sun was nearer, so at midday on the summer solstice, the evening shadow appeared early, bringing frequent winds. A thousand *li* west of the central marker, another gnomon was placed. Here, the sun was farther, so at midday on the summer solstice, the morning shadow appeared late, bringing more yin. Thus, cold, heat, yin, and wind are uneven and disharmonious, while at Yangcheng, the earth’s center, yin and yang, wind and rain harmonize—this is the true center.

As for the sun’s shadow on the earth differing by one inch per thousand *li*, according to the *San Guang Kao Ling Yao*: The four movements ascend and descend within thirty thousand *li*. The shadow at the solstice measures one foot and five inches, marking the earth’s center. This is half of thirty thousand *li*—fifteen thousand *li*—matching the *tu gui*. Thus, the shadow differs by one inch per thousand *li*, as confirmed by calculation.

Artisans establishing a state level the ground with a plumb line. They set up a gnomon with a plumb line, observing its shadow to mark the sunrise and sunset shadows. By day, they compare these with the midday shadow; by night, they verify them against the Pole Star, thus aligning morning and evening.

Right: On the method of establishing the state and rectifying its position.

The royal capital is a square of nine *li*, with three gates on each side. Within the capital, nine longitudinal and nine latitudinal roads intersect, each wide enough for nine chariot tracks. The ancestral temple is to the left, the altar of soil to the right; the court faces forward, the market behind, each occupying one *fu* (a unit of land).

"Leveling the ground with a plumb line" refers to erecting pillars at the four corners of the site and suspending plumb lines to even the terrain. "Setting up a gnomon with a plumb line and observing its shadow" involves erecting an eight-foot gnomon at the center, with plumb lines suspended from its four corners and midpoints, all attached to the pillars—thus aligning the pillars. Then, at sunrise and sunset, the shadows of the pillars are marked to determine the east-west axis. By day, the midday shadow is compared; by night, the Pole Star is observed—thus aligning the north-south axis and rectifying morning and evening. This is the method of determining direction.

A *li* is divided into a well-field, and nine wells make a nine-*li* plot. Roads running north-south are called *jing* (longitudinal), and those running east-west are called *wei* (latitudinal). With nine *jing* and nine *wei*, there are three gates on each side, totaling twelve gates, corresponding to the twelve Earthly Branches. The remaining space between roads accommodates nine chariot tracks, for the width of wheel ruts. A chariot is six feet six inches wide, with seven inches added on each side, totaling eight feet—this is the width of nine tracks. Seventy-two feet make twelve *bu* (paces). Each gate has three roads: men take the left, women the right, and chariots the center. The ancestral temple is to the left, the altar of soil to the right, flanking the central gate.

The ancestral temple pertains to yang, hence it is placed on the left; the altar of soil and grain pertains to yin, hence it is placed on the right. The three courts are all places where the ruler and ministers govern affairs, pertaining to yang and thus situated in the front; the three markets are all places where profit is contested and punishments are carried out, pertaining to yin and thus situated in the rear. Each market or court occupies one *fu* (a plot of land), equivalent to a hundred *mu*—this is the method for determining proper positions.

The *Zaishi* (Land Registrar) oversees the laws of land allocation: within the capital’s districts, residential land is assigned by *chenli*; garden plots are assigned by *changpu*; near the outskirts, land is allocated as *zhaitian* (homestead fields), *tutian* (soil fields), and *jiatian* (merchant fields); in the far outskirts, land is allocated as *gongtian* (palace fields), *niutian* (oxen fields), *shangtian* (reward fields), and *mutian* (pasture fields); in the *dian* (royal domain) region, land is assigned as *gongyi* fields; in the *shao* (suburban) region, land is assigned as *jiayi* fields; in the *xiao du* (small capital) region, land is assigned as *xian* (county) fields; and in the *da du* (great capital) region, land is assigned as *hua* (divided) fields.

The above describes the system of *xiang* (rural districts), *sui* (outlying regions), *du* (capitals), and *bi* (frontier settlements) within the royal domain. Within the royal domain of a thousand *li* square, the capital city is centrally placed, with each side extending five hundred *li*. A hundred *li* constitutes one *jie* (section), fifty *li* is the near outskirts, and within a hundred *li* lie the far outskirts. The outskirts are divided into four quadrants, with six *xiang* (rural districts) of seventy-five thousand households established at the center, while the remaining land is allocated for the nine grades of fields. The four quadrants of the outskirts contain ten thousand *jing* (well-fields) and thirty thousand households, totaling forty-eight quadrants with one hundred twenty thousand households. Here, seventy-five thousand households are assigned to the six *xiang*, while the remaining forty-five thousand households are allocated to the nine grades of fields.

Beyond the far outskirts lies the *dian* (royal domain), which is divided into twelve quadrants, with six *sui* (outlying regions) of seventy-five thousand households established at the center, while the remaining land is allocated for *gongyi* (public settlement) fields. Fields are crisscrossed by irrigation ditches, overseen by the *Suiren* (Ditch Commissioner). The twelve quadrants of the *dian* should contain three hundred sixty thousand households; here, seventy-five thousand households are assigned to the six *sui*, while the remaining two hundred eighty-five thousand households are allocated to *gongyi* fields.

Beyond the *dian* lies the *shao* (suburban) region, divided into twenty quadrants, allocated for *jiayi* (private settlement) fields. Beyond the *shao* lies the *xian* (county) region, divided into twenty-eight quadrants, allocated for *xiao du* (small capital) fields. Beyond the *xian* lies the *hua* (divided) region, divided into thirty-six quadrants, allocated for *da du* (great capital) fields. Fields are organized into well-fields and pastures, regulated by the *Xiao Situ* (Minor Land Overseer).

The *Sima Fa* states: within a hundred *li* of the royal domain lies the outskirts, within two hundred *li* lies the *zhou* (province), within three hundred *li* lies the *ye* (wilderness), within four hundred *li* lies the *xian* (county), and within five hundred *li* lies the *du* (capital).

The *Da Situ* (Grand Land Overseer) is responsible for establishing the land and population of the state, distinguishing between royal domains, feudal states, capitals, and frontier settlements. He commands that five households form a *bi* (neighborhood), ensuring mutual protection; five *bi* form a *wen* (ward), ensuring mutual support; four *wen* form a *zu* (clan), ensuring mutual burial rites; five *zu* form a *dang* (community), ensuring mutual aid; five *dang* form a *zhou* (district), ensuring mutual assistance; and five *zhou* form a *xiang* (rural district), ensuring mutual hospitality.

In establishing capitals and frontier settlements, their territories are demarcated and enclosed by ditches, with the number of households determining their scale. For land of the first grade (requiring no fallow), each household is allotted a hundred *mu*; for land of the second grade (requiring one fallow year), each household is allotted two hundred *mu*; and for land of the third grade (requiring two fallow years), each household is allotted three hundred *mu*.

Capitals and frontier settlements are the fiefs of the king’s sons, brothers, dukes, ministers, and great officers, divided into three grades. A duke’s fief in a great capital spans a hundred *li* square; a minister’s fief in a small capital spans fifty *li* square; and a great officer’s fief in a private settlement spans twenty-five *li* square. The king’s closest sons and brothers share the same rank as dukes; those next in kinship share the same rank as ministers; and those further removed share the same rank as great officers.

The *Xiao Situ* (Minor Land Overseer) organizes the people into military units for deployment. Five men form a *wu* (squad), five *wu* form a *liang* (platoon), four *liang* form a *zu* (company), five *zu* form a *lü* (battalion), five *lü* form a *shi* (division), and five *shi* form a *jun* (army). These units are mobilized for military campaigns, agricultural labor, pursuit of bandits, and collection of tribute. The six armies’ soldiers are drawn from the six *xiang*. Within the six *xiang* are *bi*, *wen*, *zu*, *dang*, *zhou*, and *xiang*. Five households form a *bi*, and when laborers are conscripted, no more than one person per household is taken, hence five men form a *wu*. Five *bi* form a *wen*, comprising twenty-five households, hence twenty-five men form a *liang*. Four *wen* form a *zu*, comprising a hundred households, hence a hundred men form a *zu*. Five *zu* form a *dang*, comprising five hundred households, hence five hundred men form a *lü*. Five *dang* form a *zhou*, comprising two thousand five hundred households, hence two thousand five hundred men form a *shi*. Five *zhou* form a *xiang*, comprising twelve thousand five hundred households, hence twelve thousand five hundred men form a *jun*.

"Mobilizing for military campaigns" refers to waging war; "agricultural labor" refers to hunting and corvée labor; "pursuit and surveillance" refers to chasing bandits and apprehending thieves; "commanding tribute" refers to the tribute of the nine grains and mountain-forest resources, as well as the provision of chariots, laborers, and corvée service for the counties.

The *Suiren* (Ditch Commissioner) oversees the wilderness of the state, using land maps to regulate fields and establish the system of counties and settlements. Five households form a *lin* (neighborhood), five *lin* form a *li* (village), four *li* form a *cuo* (hamlet), five *cuo* form a *bi* (frontier settlement), five *bi* form a *xian* (county), and five *xian* form a *sui* (outlying region). Each is demarcated by boundaries, ditches, and trees, with officials responsible for their governance, laws, and prohibitions. Annually, they inspect the people, allocate fields, maintain weapons, and instruct in farming.

The "wilderness" refers to the *dian*, *shao*, *xian*, and *du* regions. According to the *Da Situ*, the *bi*, *lü*, *zu*, *dang*, *zhou*, and *shi* correspond to the *lin*, *li*, *cuo*, *bi*, *xian*, and *sui* here. Thus, Zheng’s commentary notes that the military system of the *sui* mirrors that of the six *xiang*, and the field system of the *xiang* mirrors that of the six *sui*, indicating their mutual correspondence.

The soil of the wilderness is classified into upper, middle, and lower grades, which determine the allocation of fields and homesteads. For upper-grade land, each primary husbandman is allotted one *chen* (a unit of land), a hundred *mu* of fields, and fifty *mu* of vegetable plots, with surplus laborers receiving the same. For middle-grade land, each primary husbandman is allotted one *chen*, a hundred *mu* of fields, and a hundred *mu* of vegetable plots, with surplus laborers receiving the same.

For lower-grade land, each primary husbandman is allotted one *chen*, a hundred *mu* of fields, and two hundred *mu* of vegetable plots, with surplus laborers receiving the same. For upper-grade land, each primary husbandman is allotted one *chen*, a hundred *mu* of fields, and fifty *mu* of vegetable plots. According to the *Grand Master of the Household*, land that requires no fallowing is allotted a hundred *mu* per household, with no separate fifty-*mu* vegetable plots. For vegetable plots are fallow land that is not enclosed. For land that requires one fallow cycle, each household is allotted two hundred *mu*, with a hundred *mu* enclosed and a hundred *mu* fallow. As the land lies fallow for one year before being enclosed again, it is called "one-cycle land." For land that requires two fallow cycles, each household is allotted three hundred *mu*, with a hundred *mu* enclosed and two hundred *mu* fallow. As the land lies fallow for two years before being enclosed again, it is called "two-cycle land." Upper-grade land requires no fallow because it is naturally fertile.

To the right: the land of ten thousand husbandmen spans thirty-three *li* and a third of a *li*. In this diagram, one square represents a hundred husbandmen, and a hundred husbandmen have a *xu* (drainage canal). One row represents a thousand husbandmen, and a thousand husbandmen have a *kuai* (larger canal). Nine *kuai* form a *chuan* (river) that encircles the outer perimeter. If we examine the diagram of a hundred husbandmen, the *wen* (field paths) serve as *sui* (irrigation channels). If we consider the *xu* as *sui*, then one square represents one husbandman, and one row represents ten husbandmen, each with a *gou* (smaller ditch). If we consider the *kuai* as *gou*, then nine *gou* connect to the *xu*. If we consider the *chuan* as *xu*, the breadth and depth of the *gou* and *kuai* align with Zheng’s commentary on the well-field system. However, in the well-field system, *gou* and *kuai* are sparse, whereas in this *gou-xu* system, *gou* and *kuai* are dense. The breadth and depth of this *chuan* are twice that of a *kuai*, differing from natural rivers. In the well-field system, a hundred-*li* *wen* has only one major river.

In general, for managing the wilderness: between husbandmen’s fields lie *sui*, and above the *sui* are *jing* (footpaths); between ten husbandmen lie *gou*, and above the *gou* are *chao* (narrow paths); between a hundred husbandmen lie *xu*, and above the *xu* are *xu* (wider paths); between a thousand husbandmen lie *kuai*, and above the *kuai* are *dao* (roads); between ten thousand husbandmen lie *chuan*, and above the *chuan* are *lu* (highways), all leading to the royal domain. The fields of ten husbandmen (two *lin*) correspond to a *sui*, the fields of a hundred husbandmen (one *bi*) to a *xiang*, the fields of a thousand husbandmen (two *bi*) to a *xian*, and the fields of ten thousand husbandmen (four *xian*) to a *du*. The *sui*, *gou*, *xu*, and *kuai* all serve to channel water into the *chuan*. The *jing*, *chao*, *xu*, *dao*, and *lu* all serve to facilitate the movement of carts and pedestrians to the capital. A *jing* accommodates oxen and horses, a *chao* accommodates a large cart, a *xu* accommodates a single-track chariot, a *dao* accommodates two tracks, and a *lu* accommodates three tracks.

The land of ten thousand husbandmen spans thirty-three *li* and a third of a *li*, while ninety thousand husbandmen span one *tong* (a hundred-*li* square). If we diagram this by southern fields, the *sui* run vertically and the *gou* horizontally, the *xu* run vertically and the *kuai* horizontally, and nine *kuai* form a *chuan* that encircles the outer perimeter. The *Image* of the *Shi* hexagram states: "Water within the earth: the image of the *Shi*. The noble person thereby contains the people and nurtures the masses." Just as water does not leave the earth, soldiers do not leave the farmers. The way to nurture the masses and sustain the people requires that the capital and rural districts have *wen* and well-fields with organized units, and fields with boundaries and drainage systems. *Mencius* said that benevolent governance must begin with well-defined boundaries. Thus, drawing upon the image of water within the earth and synthesizing the *Rites of Zhou*, this diagram illustrates the well-field system to align with the principles of the *Book of Changes*.

To the right: a ten-*li* square constitutes one *cheng* (field unit). If we consider it as a hundred-*li* *tong*, then the *yi* (hamlet) serves as *dian*, the *qiu* (mound) as *xian*, the *dian* as *du*, the *gou* as *kuai*, and the *xu* as *chuan*. According to the *Artificers’ Record*, when constructing *gou* and *xu*, a plowshare is five *cun* wide. Two plowshares form an *ou* (plow team), and the width and depth of one *ou*’s furrow is one *chi* by one *chi*, called a *mu*. The head of the field is doubled in size, two *chi* wide and two *chi* deep, called a *sui*. Nine husbandmen form a well-field, and the space between well-fields is four *chi* wide and four *chi* deep, called a *gou*. A ten-*li* square forms a *cheng*, and the space between *cheng* is eight *chi* wide and eight *chi* deep, called a *xu*. A hundred-*li* square forms a *tong*, and the space between *tong* is two *xun* wide and two *ren* deep, called a *kuai*. The *mu* run vertically and the *sui* horizontally; the *gou* run vertically and the *xu* horizontally; the *kuai* run vertically and natural rivers horizontally.

The *Minor Master of the Household* surveys the land and organizes the fields and pastures into well-fields. Nine husbandmen form a well-field, four well-fields form a hamlet, four hamlets form a *qiu*, four *qiu* form a *dian*, four *dian* form a *xian*, and four *xian* form a *du*. This system assigns land duties and regulates tribute and taxation. This refers to the construction of *du* and *bi* (rural districts) and the well-field system for fiefdoms, which differs from the *xiang* and *sui* systems. Fertile land is organized into well-fields, while elevated and marshy land is used for pastures. Nine husbandmen form a pasture, and two pastures are equivalent to one well-field. A one-*li* square is divided into nine sections, each of a hundred *mu*. One husbandman receives a hundred *mu*, forming a nine-husbandman well-field. Four well-fields form a hamlet, and a hamlet spans two *li*. Four hamlets form a *qiu*, and a *qiu* spans four *li*. Four *qiu* form a *dian*, and a *dian* spans eight *li*. Adding one *li* on all sides makes a ten-*li* square, forming one *cheng* with a hundred well-fields and nine hundred husbandmen. Of these, sixty-four well-fields (five hundred seventy-six husbandmen) pay field taxes, while the surrounding thirty-six well-fields (three hundred twenty husbandmen) maintain the *xu*. Four *cheng* form a *xian*, equivalent to four *dian*. Considering the center of one *cheng*, this system extends to all four sides, with *dian* serving as *cheng*. A *xian* spans twenty *li*. Four *xian* form a *du*, and a *du* spans forty *li*. Four *du* span eighty *li*, and adding ten *li* on all sides makes a hundred-*li* square, forming one *tong* with ten thousand well-fields and ninety thousand husbandmen. Of these, six thousand four hundred well-fields (fifty-six thousand seven hundred husbandmen) pay field taxes, while three thousand six hundred well-fields (thirty-two thousand four hundred husbandmen) maintain the *kuai*. The well-field system is fully realized in one *tong*.

Here, the system is only described up to the *du* because those who hold fiefdoms and receive land revenue contribute a quarter of their produce, with three grades of land allocation. In a hundred-*li* state, there are four *du*, and one *du*’s taxes are paid to the king. In a fifty-*li* state, there are four *xian*, and one *xian*’s taxes are paid to the king.

A twenty-five-*li* state comprises four *dian*, with one *dian*’s taxes paid to the king.

According to the *Methods of the Minister of War*, six *chi* make one *bu*, a hundred *bu* make one *mu*, a hundred *mu* make one *fu*, three *fu* make one *wu*, three *wu* make one well-field, and ten well-fields make one *tong*. Within one *cheng*, one *li* is divided into sections, with ten sections arranged both lengthwise and crosswise to form one row, and one row of ten well-fields making one *tong*. Each *tong* consists of thirty households, providing one warhorse, one soldier, and two attendants. Though a *tong* nominally contains ninety *fu*, the figure of thirty households accounts for the deduction of one-third for official residences and alleys, leaving only sixty *fu*. Given the variations in land quality—unalterable, once-reclaimable, and twice-reclaimable—each *tong* allots three *fu* to receive the land of six *fu*, so that sixty *fu* of land correspond to only thirty households, which supply one warhorse, one soldier, and two attendants.

Ten *tong* make one *cheng*, a *cheng* being a ten-*li* square. A hundred well-fields and three hundred households provide one chariot, ten soldiers, and twenty attendants. Ten *cheng* make one *zhong*, a *zhong* comprising a thousand well-fields and three thousand households, with ten chariots, a hundred soldiers, and two hundred attendants. Ten *zhong* make one *tong*, a *tong* being a hundred-*li* square, containing ten thousand well-fields and thirty thousand households, with a hundred chariots, a thousand soldiers, and two thousand attendants. Ten *tong* make one *feng*, a *feng* encompassing a hundred thousand well-fields and three hundred thousand households, with a thousand chariots, ten thousand soldiers, and twenty thousand attendants. Ten *feng* make one *ji*, a *ji* being a thousand-*li* square, containing a million well-fields and three million households, with ten thousand chariots, a hundred thousand soldiers, and two hundred thousand attendants.

The *Lu Song* states: “The Duke’s chariots number a thousand, and his troops thirty thousand,” referring to both soldiers and attendants combined.
