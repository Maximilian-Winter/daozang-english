**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate (*Taiji tu*)**
Before the Supreme Ultimate had images or numbers, there was only *qi*. Once *qi* divided, the light and pure ascended to become Heaven, while the heavy and turbid descended to become Earth—thus were the Two Modes (*liangyi*) born. Once the Two Modes divided, the positions of metal, wood, water, and fire were arrayed in the four directions—thus were the Four Images (*sixiang*) born. Water, numbered six, resides in *Kan* and generates *Qian*; metal, numbered nine, resides in *Dui* and generates *Kun*; fire, numbered seven, resides in *Li* and generates *Xun*; wood, numbered eight, resides in *Zhen* and generates *Gen*—thus do the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams (*bagua*).

**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate by Master Zhou (*Zhou shi Taiji tu*)**
Master Zhou Maoshu said: “From Non-Ultimate (*wuji*) comes the Supreme Ultimate (*taiji*). The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and when stillness reaches its limit, it moves again. Movement and stillness alternate as each other’s root, dividing into yin and yang—thus are the Two Modes established. Yang transforms and yin conjoins, giving rise to water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The five *qi* distribute in order, and the four seasons proceed. The Five Phases (*wuxing*) are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally Non-Ultimate. As the Five Phases arise, each embodies its nature. The truth of Non-Ultimate and the essence of the Two and Five (*erwu*) wondrously unite and congeal. The Way of *Qian* completes the male, the Way of *Kun* completes the female. The two *qi* interact and transform, giving rise to the myriad things. The myriad things ceaselessly generate, and their transformations are inexhaustible.”

**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate Penetrating the One by Master Zheng (*Zheng shi Taiji guan yi tu*)**
Master Shao Mei said: “The positions of the Eight Trigrams began with Fuxi, were doubled in the Xia and Shang dynasties, and expanded in the Zhou. When Confucius composed the *Classic*, he did not alter their orientations, for they truly derive from the original text and numbers of the *River Diagram* (*Hetu*) and *Luo Writing* (*Luoshu*). The intent of their composition all returns to the center—this is the Way of holding fast to the center and the One. The Supreme Ultimate strikes the One and resonates with the Five, yielding the number six, which is the Supreme Ultimate containing the Three and extending to the Six. None is closer to the Supreme Ultimate than *Qian*, which emerges from the center and occupies the six positions correctly—this is what Master Zeng called the *loyalty and reciprocity* of the *One Thread*. None employs the Supreme Ultimate more than *Zhen*, which is why *Zhen* occupies the third position, attaining the Supreme Ultimate’s containment of the Three in its roundness. It does not move from correctness—this is what Master Zisi called *issuing in harmony with the mean*. None divides the Supreme Ultimate more than *Kan* and *Kun*. *Kan* obtains its One, *Kun* obtains its Two—One is thus Two, and Two is thus Three. This is why water and earth both arise in *Shen*. Good and evil, yin and yang—those who grasp only one are not aligned with the Way. This is called *losing the center*, and the learning of the *Mean* does not accept it. Broadly considering the great scheme: the yang numbers one, three, seven, and nine are distributed to the four directions, embodying the principle of solstices and equinoxes; the yin numbers two, four, six, and eight are distributed to the four corners, embodying the principle of openings and closings. This is the principle of seeking the central *qi* and accumulating intercalary months.”

**Numbers of the *River Diagram* (*Hetu shu*)**
Liu Mu transmitted it from Fan Kuachang, who received it from Xu Jian, who obtained it from Li Dai, who received it from Zhong Fang, who obtained it from Master Xiyi (Chen Tuan). The diagram bears nine atop and one below, with three on the left and seven on the right. One and six form the shoulders, two and four the waist, and six and eight the feet. Vertically and horizontally, the numbers sum to fifteen, totaling forty-five. *Lie Yukou* said: “The *Changes* is One. One transforms into seven, seven transforms into nine, and nine transforms back into one.” Li Kangbo said: “This is what Fuxi observed in the *River Diagram* when he drew the trigrams.” It is also called the Nine Palaces (*jiugong*), which is why diviners regard one, six, and eight as white; two as black; three as green; four as azure; five as yellow; seven as red; and nine as purple. Does this not originate here?

**Numbers of the *Luo Writing* (*Luoshu shu*)**

Nie Shilin said: "Heavenly One and Earthly Six unite in the north to generate water; Earthly Two and Heavenly Seven unite in the south to generate fire; Heavenly Three and Earthly Eight unite in the east to generate wood; Earthly Four and Heavenly Nine unite in the west to generate metal; Heavenly Five and Earthly Ten unite in the center to generate earth." Zhu Hanshang stated: "One, three, five, seven, and nine are odd numbers, the so-called twenty-five celestial numbers; two, four, six, eight, and ten are even numbers, the so-called thirty terrestrial numbers, totaling fifty-five. This is what brings about transformations and governs the spirits." *Diagram of the Fifteen Natural Numbers of Heaven and Earth*

Nie said: "Its principles are six: first, the *River Diagram*, whose vertical and horizontal lines all sum to fifteen; second, from Heavenly One to Earthly Ten, there are fifteen numbers in total; third, the Great Ultimate is undifferentiated as One, One divides into the Two Modes, the Two Modes separate into the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams—these are the fifteen numbers; fifth, the numbers of the Five Phases, when bisected to symbolize yin and yang—seven as lesser yang, eight as lesser yin—also sum to fifteen; sixth, eight is lesser yin, yin moves and retreats to become full yin, hence it is called six; seven is lesser yang, yang moves and advances to become full yang, hence it is called nine. Six and nine combined also make fifteen—all these are the natural numbers of heaven and earth."

*The Changes as Sun and Moon*
Zheng (Hou) said: "The *Changes* (*Yi*) is composed of 'sun' (日) and 'moon' (月). 一 is the sun; － is the moon. All principles under heaven are exhausted in the alternation of odd and even. Beyond this, there is no further *Change*. Heavenly patterns, earthly principles, human affairs, the categories of things, the subtleties of nature and destiny, the wonders of transformation—all things such as prosperity and decline, gain and loss, advance and retreat, speech and silence—have their counterparts. Thus, the *Changes* employs one long line and one short line to encompass them all. This is what is meant by 'one yin and one yang are called the Dao.'"

*Diagram of the Six Positions and Three Ultimates*
Right: Corresponds to the human body
Right: Accords with earthly principles
Right: Aligns with celestial patterns

He Sha, styled Zhengshaoxi, said: "The six positions take one, three, four, and five as the warp and seven, eight, nine, and six as the weft, symbolizing celestial patterns. Heaven takes the dragon, tiger, crow, and tortoise as its warp, and the celestial stems, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus as its weft. The warp of the six positions lacks the number of the Dark Warrior because, gazing north, only the Dipper’s pivot and the Pole Star are visible. Thus, the Dipper is called the Northern Dipper, and the Pole Star is called the Northern Culmen. Though named 'north,' it is in truth the center of heaven—this is the number of the Great Ultimate, One and Six, latent within Five. In the *River Diagram*, Six and One reside in the north at *hai* and *zi*, while Five occupies the center—thus, both center and north possess the numbers of the Great Ultimate. The weft of the six positions lacks the number of Saturn because Saturn completes one circuit of the heavens in twenty-eight years, while Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and the celestial stems all traverse the lodges governed by Saturn, akin to the saying of yin-yang theorists that 'earth dwells in the central palace, ruling the four seasons.' Thus, the *Changes* has three hundred eighty-four lines in total, corresponding to the numbers of the celestial images, and the changes of fortune are divined through seven, eight, nine, and six, like the variations of the five planets."

This is Fu Xi’s Eight Trigrams. For heaven and earth arise naturally, their numbers reversing and advancing, their meaning inexhaustible. First revealed by Master Chen Xiyi, it was transmitted to Master Shao Kangjie.

*Diagram of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Yin-Yang Doubling and Multiplication*
This diagram was transmitted by Hong Ziwei Mai, who stated: "This diagram—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight—thus the sequence of the eight positions all accords with the *Prior Heaven Diagram*. One, two, three, four differ from eight, seven, six, five."

Han Shang states: On the vernal equinox, the sun first emerges at *jia*; on the autumnal equinox, it sets at dusk into *geng*. *Jia* and *geng* mark the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. The inner black halo, starting from *jiazi*, *jiaxu*, and *jiashen*, forms the three *Prior Jia*—with *jiashen* precisely aligning with the outer halo’s *geng*. Speaking of *gengshen*, one thus knows the days of the *Prior Jia*. The outer white halo, starting from *jiawu*, *jiachen*, and *jiayin*, forms the three *Posterior Jia*—with *jiayin* again aligning with the inner halo’s *geng*. Speaking of *gengyin*, one thus knows the days of the *Posterior Jia*.

*Diagram of the Eight Trigrams’ Reception of Jia*
*Li* is the sun. The moon *li* (detaches) from the sun to form the *Kun* image. It surpasses the three-day image, returns to the five-day image, and after seven days, restores its full brightness, then retreats to *xin*. The Dipper’s moon properly emanates from *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* retains the sun’s proper essence; *Li* is the moon—these are the proper essences of sun and moon, possessing brightness. From the conjunction of the dark and new moon, it emerges from *geng* as *Zhen*, appears as the first quarter at *ding*, waxes to *jia* and *ren* as *Dui*, and faces the sun, thus forming the *Qian* image. After fullness, it generates the waning phase as the *Xun* image. Over eight days, it wanes at *bing* as the *Gen* image. After seventeen days, the last quarter then reunites with the sun at the position of the celestial division.

*Diagram of the Original Images of the Eight Trigrams*

Master He Sha Zheng said: *Qian* is three lines forming Heaven—this is because the One enfolds the Three. *Kun* is six lines forming Earth—this is because the paired Two becomes Six. The fundamental numbers of Heaven as One and Earth as Two, the fundamental lines of Heaven as odd and Earth as even, are self-evident without need for comparison. Yet the sublime principle lies precisely in the One enfolding the Three and the Two enfolding the Six.

*Qian*, the One enfolding the Three, thus generates three sons, all odd. *Kun*, the Two enfolding the Six, thus generates three daughters, all even. Is this not the wondrous principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation?

*Zhen* is Thunder, which emerges from beneath the earth—hence its single yang line lies below. *Kan* is Water, which accumulates within the earth—hence its single yang line lies within. *Gen* is Mountain, whose form rises above the earth—hence its single yang line lies above. Now, yang is movement and yin is stillness; that which takes movement as its foundation is *Zhen*. That which takes stillness as its foundation is *Gen*. Movement occurring in the center—neither inner nor outer—thus flows or halts, moves or rests, which is why *Kan* is Water.

*Xun* is Wood, which sprouts from beneath the earth—hence its single yin line also lies below. *Li* is Fire, which arises from within wood—hence its single yin line lies within. *Dui* is Marsh, which collects upon the earth—hence its single yin line lies above. Yet yin is yielding and yang is firm; thus Wood begins weak but ends strong, for yang resides at its end. Yang is bright and yin is obscure; thus Fire shines outwardly but is dark within, for yang resides without. Yang is dry and yin is moist; thus Marsh is moist without but dry within, for yang resides within.

Someone asked: Why is Marsh dry within?
I replied: Dryness within enables it to generate Metal, while moisture without enables it to collect Water. That Metal generates Water and Earth generates Metal can be understood through Marsh. How could the Sage have spoken carelessly?

Master Zheng said:
*Qian* advances forward by one to become *Gou*—*Gou* is the first generation of *Qian*.
From *Gou*, advancing by two yields *Dun*—*Dun* is the second generation of *Qian*.
From *Dun*, advancing by four yields *Pi*—*Pi* is the third generation of *Qian*.
From *Pi*, advancing by eight yields *Guan*—*Guan* is the fourth generation of *Qian*.
From *Guan*, advancing by sixteen yields *Bo*—*Bo* is the fifth generation of *Qian*.
The top line remains unchanged, hence the thirty-two count is not used. Those thirty yin and thirty-two yang are all the top lines of the sixty-four hexagrams.

Hexagrams have Wandering Souls and Returning Souls, also following the pattern of eight and sixteen.
*Qian*’s Wandering Soul retreats by eight from *Bo* to become *Jin*; its Returning Soul advances by sixteen from *Qian* to become *Dayou*—this is the natural principle.
*Kun*’s reverse progression follows the same rule.

*Zhen* retreats by one to become *Yu*; from *Yu*, advancing by two yields *Xie*; from *Xie*, advancing by four yields *Heng*; from *Heng*, retreating by eight yields *Sheng*; from *Sheng*, advancing by sixteen yields *Jing*, completing the five generations.
Its Wandering Soul advances by eight from *Jing* to become *Daguo*; its Returning Soul advances by sixteen from its original hexagram to become *Sui*.

*Kan* moves right by one to become *Jie*; retreats by two to become *Zhun*; from *Zhun*, advances by four to become *Jiji*; from *Jiji*, advances by eight to become *Ge*; from *Ge*, retreats by sixteen to become *Feng*, completing the five generations.
Its Wandering Soul retreats by eight from *Feng* to become *Mingyi*; its Returning Soul retreats by sixteen from its original hexagram to become *Shi*.

*Li* follows the same pattern.

*Gen* moves right and retreats by one to become *Bi*; from *Bi*, retreats by two to become *Daxu*; retreats by four to become *Sun*; from *Kui*, retreats by sixteen to become *Lü*, completing the five generations.
Its Wandering Soul advances by eight from *Lü* to become *Zhongfu*; its Returning Soul retreats by sixteen from its original hexagram to become *Jian*.

*Dui* follows the same pattern.

**Diagram of the Emperor Emerging from *Zhen***

Master Xiyi says: Proper positions are named by their directions, thus *Zhen* is east, *Li* south, *Dui* west, and *Kan* north. The four corners denote positions, thus *Gen* is northeast, *Xun* southeast, and *Qian* northwest. *Kun* alone is called "Earth" because all eight directions are governed by Earth.

*Dui* is designated as the proper autumn, yet its direction is not specified—by naming the proper autumn, the four seasons’ governing directions become evident by analogy. *Li* is called "mutual seeing" because all things are revealed therein. *Dui* is called "joyful speech" not because autumn is a time of universal delight, but because *Dui*’s body is marsh; the marsh is where things find joy, irrespective of the season. *Gen* is called "completion" because its body brings all things to rest, lacking the meaning of generation and growth. Yet here it is spoken of as the beginning of generation and growth because *Gen* connects to *yin*, hence the special mention. *Kun* is given the word "devotion" because it devotes its function to *Qian*. All others follow by analogy.

**Diagram of Hexagrams Aligned with Directions**

Zheng Hesha says: The single *qi* of creation is the single mind of the sage. The *qi* of creation originates in generation, and the sage’s mind likewise aims to benefit the world. Thus, it cannot but move from stillness to activity, from nonbeing into being, enabling all things to fulfill their lives and secure their livelihoods. Why do people not perceive its nearness? The reason lies in this: though the *qi* of creation and the sage’s mind move, they do not depart from stillness; though they become manifest, they do not abandon nonbeing. Yet all things and all people toil, rejoice, struggle, and labor within it without self-awareness. This is why the sequence of the eight hexagrams emerges from *Zhen* and is completed in *Gen*. Is this not because the *qi* of creation and the sage’s mind are one? Is this not what is called the Emperor?

**Diagram of *Qian* and *Kun* Not Occupying the Four Cardinal Positions**

Master Shi says: *Qian* resides in the northwest, embodying the Way of the Father. The Father’s Way is reverence and solemnity; the *qi* of stern cold prevails in the northwest. *Kun* resides in the southwest, embodying the Way of the Mother. The Mother’s Way is nurturance; the *qi* of fostering life thrives in the southwest.

He further states: The northwest is the convergence of winter, the direction where all things reach completion. The southwest is where all things flourish. *Kun* is the Way of Earth, positioned in the place of growth and nurturance, fostering all things and attributing their completion to *Qian*. Just as a minister serves the king, not daring to claim personal achievement but returning all merit to the ruler, this reveals how Heaven, though nonactive, engenders all things, and how the ruler, though hands-off, governs the world.

**Diagram of *Kan* and *Li* as the Center of Heaven and Earth**

Zhu Hanshang says: *Qian* and *Kun* are Heaven and Earth, spirits and gods; *Kan* and *Li* are the sun and moon, water and fire; *Gen* and *Dui* are mountains and marshes; *Zhen* and *Xun* are wind and thunder. *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* govern the four seasons. *Kan* is the center of Heaven and Earth.

When the sage attains the center of Heaven and Earth, they harmonize with Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the four seasons, and the spirits. Acting prior to Heaven, Heaven does not oppose; the sage is Heaven and Earth. Following Heaven’s timing, Heaven and Earth become the sage. When the sage unites with Heaven and Earth as one, their actions are witnessed by all things.

Like sounds resonate—*Zhen* and *Xun* exemplify this. Like *qi* seeks like—*Gen* and *Dui* exemplify this. Water flows toward the moist, fire inclines toward the dry—*Kan* and *Li* exemplify this. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger; all living and formed things follow their kind naturally.

"Minor" refers to the offering.
In the current edition, one character "minor" (小) is omitted.

*The Appended Judgments*: "The second line receives much praise; the fourth line harbors much fear."

In the current edition, the phrase "is nearness" is mistakenly taken as part of the main text, while the character "fear" (惧) is omitted from the commentary.

*Miscellaneous Hexagrams*: "*Meng* is youthful and manifest."
In the current edition, "youthful" (稚) is mistakenly written as "miscellaneous" (杂).

The above is recorded in Hong Zimei’s *Rongzhai Suibi*, which states: Guo Jing’s *Rectifications* in three fascicles claims to have obtained the authentic transmitted edition, hand-copied and annotated by Wang Fusi and Han Kangbo, comprising one hundred and three entries differing from the currently circulating edition. I once encountered this book in the *Daoist Canon* in Fuzhou and transmitted it. Later, in the Rear Secretariat, I also saw *Explications of the Changes* presented by Chao Gongwu, which frequently cited it. Few in the world possess this book; here, I have briefly selected twenty clear instances to record.

*Illustrations of the Zhou Changes*, first fascicle, concludes.

---

*Illustrations of the Zhou Changes*, three fascicles, is a *Daoist Canon* edition without an attributed author. One theory holds that it was written by Zhang Li of the Yuan dynasty. It is not recorded in *Investigations into Classical Exegesis*, and the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* *Annotated Catalogue* mentions it under *Profound Illustrations of the Images and Numbers of the Great Changes*: "Zhu Xi and Lu Zuqian’s *Chart of Transmitted Classics* lists Zhang Li’s works as *Illustrations of the Zhou Changes* in three fascicles, *Profound Illustrations of the Images and Numbers of the Changes* in six fascicles, and *Explications of the Images of the Changes* in six fascicles. Jiao Hong’s *Bibliography of Classics* matches the *Chart of Transmitted Classics*. The latter two works are separately recorded in the *Complete Library* under the *Changes* category of the Classics section and the *Numerology* category of the Masters section, but *Illustrations of the Zhou Changes* is not mentioned at all. Upon consulting the *Comprehensive Catalogue of Chinese Collectanea*, it states that the book is included in the *Tongzhi Hall Explications of Classics*, but upon examining the *Explications*, the book is not found. The *Comprehensive Catalogue*’s claim appears to rely solely on the *Annotated Catalogue*. Upon examining other Daoist scriptures and *Changes*-related works, no different editions were found. However, it was discovered that much of the book’s content overlaps with *Profound Illustrations of the Images and Numbers of the Changes*, so it is provisionally collated with the Ming *Zhengtong Daoist Canon* edition of *Profound Illustrations*. During collation, the original text’s appearance is preserved as much as possible, with this note provided.

#7 "Exhortation and Mutual Aid" originally written as "Mutual Exhortation"; corrected according to the Ruan edition of the *Thirteen Classics with Annotations and Commentaries*. #8 "Prosperity" originally written as "Offering"; emended according to the Ruan edition of the *Thirteen Classics with Annotations and Exegeses*. #9 The text from the character "cloud" onward to the end of the preceding volume, along with the content of Guo Jing’s *Brief Rectifications of the Zhou Changes* appended earlier, was collectively published in Hong Mai’s *Rongzhai’s Random Jottings*, Volume Six, under the title "Rectifications of the Changes." Neither belongs to the works of the *Illustrations of the Zhou Changes*’ author. This note is provided to prevent later scholars from confusion.

*Illustrations of the Zhou Changes*, Volume Middle
Sixty-Four Hexagrams with Diagrams and Explications on the Simplicity of Qian and Kun, Composed by Master Sha Zheng

Qian and Kun are the numbers one and two, the shapes square and round, the qi pure and turbid, the principles dynamic and static. Thus, Qian embodies the meaning of the Two Modes, dividing the forms of the Four Images above and below, and separating the directions south, north, east, and west. The Two Modes and Four Images together number six; including the original essences of Qian and Kun, the numbers of the Eight Trigrams are complete. This is why Qian and Kun remain not far from the Supreme Ultimate.

Inner constancy and outer regret are the principles of the Two Modes. Origin, Prosperity, Benefit, and Constancy are the Dao of the Four Images. Two, three, four, and five serve as the warp; seven, eight, nine, and six serve as the weft—such is the structure of the Eight Trigrams. Thus, from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight, from eight to sixteen; from sixteen to thirty-two, from thirty-two to sixty-four—when sixty-four is reached, the Dao of Heaven is complete, the year’s work is accomplished, and human affairs are fulfilled. This is why the *Changes* consists of sixty-four hexagrams, with *Qian* and *Kun* at the forefront.

If scholars can reduce the sixty-four to one and from one awaken to the Supreme Ultimate, then Fu Xi, King Wen, and Confucius are all embodied within me. To effect transformations and traverse the spiritual—this too is the Dao.

*Diagram of the Zhun Image*
The north’s Kan is called Greater Yin. The east’s Zhen is called Lesser Yang. Yang qi enters Greater Yin; yang moves while yin is trapped—this is why it is *Zhun*.

*Diagram of Nourishing Integrity in Youth*
When youthful ignorance resides in the fifth line and is struck from above, this is external learning. What enters through the ears and eyes, though sufficient to aid me, is just enough to harm my true nature—thus, it is "not advantageous to act as a bandit."

When embracing ignorance resides in the second line and is aroused from the initial line, this is internal learning. What the heart creates values foresight; once a thought takes root in the mind, it becomes a mechanism—hence, "removing the bolt and crossbar" leads to regret. Is advantage not the bolt and crossbar of my heart?

*Diagram of Necessity and Waiting*
In *Xu*, the yang within Kan serves as assistance; the yang of the Qian hexagram seeks to wait for the uppermost yang as support. One yin avoids it and advances with it, while another yin obstructs it and causes retreat—this is why *Xu*’s auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise. Yet the sage’s intent does not blame the two yins but blames the three yangs; it does not blame the three yangs but blames the yang within Kan. Where advantage lies, blame is heavy—thus, it is further associated with the image of food and drink.

Food and drink are tools for nourishing people, the means by which people seek to wait. To be ensnared by food and drink and thereby harmed—such cases exist.

Those who first covet its advantage but ultimately suffer its harm—this is the constant way of the petty person. There must be a Dao by which to handle it, and this is why steadfast auspiciousness is prized. "Steadfast" (貞) signifies central correctness. When inner correctness is maintained, the outer is firm; when the outer is firm, one does not fall into peril.

*Diagram of Contention*
Qian resides in the *hai* position, Kan arises in the *zi* direction. Both *hai* and *zi* lie in the north, belonging to water, and thus contention has not yet begun. Once *Li* takes form, heaven tilts westward, water flows eastward, heaven coils above, and water moistens below—thus *Song* (Contention) arises.

*Diagram of the Army and Union in Governing the Multitude*
*Kun* represents the multitude, and *Shi* (the Army) also represents the multitude—this is the meaning of *Shi* as the commander of the multitude. To command the multitude, virtue is indispensable. Thus, the second yang of *Qian* enters *Kun* to form *Shi*, for the virtue of *Qian* resides in the second line. Pitch arises from number, and number emerges from the center. The *Huangzhong* pitch initiates the standards of length, volume, and weight; even a hair’s breadth of deviation is unacceptable. The northern *Kan* is the root of *Huangzhong*, hence the mention of the "elder" (*zhangren*) in the line text and "pitch" (*lü*) in the judgment. Both "elder" and "pitch" derive from standards of measure—are they not the province of those with virtue?

The north governs the dark, yin, and punitive images, while the south governs the bright, yang, and flourishing images. The six lines of the first line divide the numbers of the second, third, fourth, and fifth lines. *Quezhou*’s two twos reside in the south, the land of *Li*’s brightness—thus, the north is made to face south. The fifth line occupies the center, which is not the north. Gazing northward from heaven, only the Dipper’s pivot and the Pole Star are visible. The Pole Star is called the Northern Asterism (*Beichen*), and the Dipper is called the Northern Dipper (*Beidou*); though named "north," they are in truth the center of heaven. *Shi* faces north, hence the idea of five men forming a squad. *Bi* (Union) faces south, hence the image of five ranks of nobility.

The uppermost line occupies the fifth position, lagging behind its lord—thus it is said: "The last man is inauspicious!"

*Diagram of Great and Small Accumulation’s Auspiciousness and Inauspiciousness*
*Xun* resides in the southeast, and *Qian*’s qi flows from *zi* to *si* into *Xun*, where it is accumulated—this is called *Xiaochu* (Small Accumulation), for yin arises in *Xun*. *Xun* is the faintest of yin, hence it is called "small." *Gen* resides in the northeast, and *Qian*’s qi flows from *zi* to *yin* into *Gen*, where it is accumulated—this is called *Dachu* (Great Accumulation), for yang culminates in *Gen*. *Gen* is the exhaustion of yang, hence it is called "great." From *zi* to *yin*, the three lines form *Qian*—this is *Gen* accumulating *Qian*’s steadfastness and *Xun* accumulating *Qian*’s regret.

The reason *Dachu* gains authority is that it transforms *Xiaochu*’s nine in the fifth place to six in the fifth place, humbling itself and lowering its position—this is how it gains authority and accumulates others. The reason *Xiaochu* loses authority is that it transforms *Dachu*’s six in the fifth place to nine in the fifth place, becoming full and arrogant—this is how it loses authority and is accumulated by others.

*Diagram of Treading on the Tiger’s Tail*
*Qian* resides in the *hai* position; the first line originally forms the walls, and the second line begins to rise as *Kui*. *Kui* is connected to it—this shows the image of treading on the tiger’s tail. *Kun* resides in the *shen* position; *Shen*’s first line originally belongs to *Kun*, and when *Shen* is connected to *Dui*, this shows the tiger’s tail biting the person. When *Qian* resides below *Dui*, there is no image of treading on the tiger’s tail or of it biting or not biting. *Qian* riding *Dui* clarifies the image of treading on the tiger. The *Lü* hexagram moves from *Dui* into *Qian*, from *xu* to *hai*, in accordance with the Dao of humanity responding to heaven.

*Diagram of Obstruction and Peace’s Alternation*
Observing the image of *Tai* (Peace), one sees where *Pi* (Obstruction) arises; observing the image of *Pi*, one sees where *Tai* begins. This is the qi of yin and yang ascending, descending, rising, and falling to form images—thus, the hexagrams *Pi* and *Tai* are both called "coming and going."

*Diagram of Fellowship*
*Qian* occupies the upper three lines with thirty-six counting rods; if its middle line is changed, it aligns with *Li*. *Li* occupies the lower three lines with twenty-four counting rods; if its middle line is changed, it aligns with *Qian*. This is called "two people with one heart"—their outward appearances differ, but their hearts are the same.

*Diagram of Great Possession’s Guarding of Position*
In the *Dayou* hexagram, when the multitude of yang is flourishing, and the fifth line is occupied by six, the lord embodies the origin and occupies the correct position—how could he not know the benevolence of guarding his position? Extending this principle: the fourth line represents attendants, hence "not his greatness"; the third line represents the three dukes, hence "the duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven"; the second line represents provincial governors, hence "the great wagon bears its load"; the first line, far from the lord’s position, has the image of remote borderlands and barbarians, hence "the origin meets with harm." All these express the Dao of enacting governance and extending benevolence. If this is so, blessings will reach the ancestral temples, and the enterprise will endure for ten thousand generations.

*Diagram of Humility*
*Gen* resides in *yin*, belonging to wood, which is benevolence; *Kun* resides in *shen*, belonging to metal, which is righteousness—thus, the fifth and upper lines bear the image of punitive force. Humility takes utmost sincerity as its foundation, for words are the voice of the heart. Insincere words do not arise from sincerity; if they do not come from the heart’s foundation, they are false. Thus, humility that resides within is utmost sincerity, while that which resides without is insincere—this is why humility is merely a sound, for it is humility in appearance but competitiveness within.

*Diagram of Delight*
*Zhen* resides below *Kun*—this is called *Fu* (Return), the one yang of the hexagram, the heart of heaven and earth. Now it emerges above *Kun*—this is *Yu* (Delight) emerging from the earth, also the heart of heaven and earth. The lines within *Kun* are stillness within stillness, hence "firm as a rock." The lines within *Zhen* are movement within stillness, hence "steadfast in illness, ever undying."

*Diagram of Following and Losing Connection*
From *Zhen* to *Dui*, from east to west, this is the meaning of spring’s labor and autumn’s harvest—this is called *Sui* (Following). Yang arises from within yin, and yin follows yang’s movement. Yin comes to welcome yang and delights in it, while yang follows yin’s gathering.

Thus, the upper line of *Dui* bears the image of a tethered deer.

*Diagram of Multitudes and Decay*
*Xun* resides in the *si* position—where metal is born. When it reaches *you*, metal flourishes, and *Xun*’s work is complete, hence the fifth line of *Xun* speaks of *geng*. Below *Gen*, especially in the *yin* position of wood’s domain, it speaks of *jia*. *Jia* and *geng* divide the *zi* and *wu* positions, circulating endlessly—this is the Dao of exercising authority. Metal overcomes wood; when metal lies beneath wood, it is as if decay is born within the wood. This is the natural image of *Gu* (Decay). The ninth line, dwelling atop the mountain, possesses lofty aspirations, sufficient to rouse the corrupt winds of decay and embolden the timid to stand firm.

*Diagram of Overseeing*
What is the image of the *Lin* (Overseeing) hexagram? It is that of the ruler overseeing those below. To oversee those below lies in bestowing virtue upon them. If yang resides below, like heaven’s qi moving them, and the ruler privately nurtures sincerity in his heart above, then he acts with wisdom at the center, prioritizing sincerity and simplicity, as the lofty and bright yield with gentle strength. That sweetness of *Dui*’s mouth can nurture one but cannot act—like a king who merely issues decrees and exhortations while his benevolent influence fails to reach the people. How can this be called the Dao of bestowing virtue and nurturing sincerity?

*Diagram of Observing the Nation’s Splendor*
Four yin lines arise—this is a hexagram of yin encroaching upon yang. Compared to yang encroaching upon yin, it follows the principle of *Da Zhuang* (Great Strength). It is not called *Xiao Zhuang* (Lesser Strength) but *Guan* (Observation), for yin submits to *Xun* yet harbors no intent to encroach upon yang. If those below submit to *Xun*, those above must act with centrality and correctness—only then can they lead those below to observe and transform the encroachment of yang. Otherwise, how could this be achieved?

*Diagram of Biting and Chewing*
*Shi He* (Biting and Chewing) fundamentally takes the mouth as its image, yet the toes, nose, ears, and eyes are also struck by it, for the entire body relies on the mouth for nourishment. Nourishment with the Dao brings the blessing of *Shi He*; nourishment without the Dao brings its misfortune. Misfortune is frequent, blessing rare—this is because petty men are often driven by greed. *Shi He* begins with lightning and ends with thunder: lightning flashes, then thunder crashes; the tongue moves, then the teeth chew—this is the natural principle. Both *Shi He* and *Bi* (Adornment) contain objects within *Yi* (Nourishment). The first two lines form *Bi*, while the first line alone forms *Shi He*—*Shi He* obtains the lower movement of *Yi*, while *Bi* obtains its upper stillness. Only with lower movement does *Shi He* arise.

*Diagram of Heavenly Patterns*
*Li* represents the sun, moon, and stars—the patterns of heaven. *Gen* represents mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees—the patterns of earth. Yet Confucius spoke only of heavenly patterns and not of earthly ones, for in observing images to create the *Xiang* (Images), there is the image of the sun and moon greeting the dawn. The sun and moon meet at dawn through their greeting of light, and the alternation of dawn and dusk completes the four seasons—this is how one examines the changes of time. *Li* contains the meaning of continuing brightness, and when *Bi* transforms the fourth line of *Li*, the sun and moon embrace—this is the essential Dao of heavenly patterns.

*Diagram of Yang Qi as Seed*
The single yang below in the *Fu* (Return) hexagram is the upper yang of *Bo* (Splitting Apart) falling to earth, hence the image of a great fruit that does not ripen. Is this not the seed of yang qi? Thus, *Qian* becomes the wooden fruit, and wood is born in *hai*. *Hai* is the position of *Qian*. Wood has life but has not yet sprouted; once it sprouts, it generates offspring. Offspring means reproduction. The un-sprouted fruit originates from the upper yang of *Bo*, like a fruit at the end of a branch.

*Diagram of the Seven-Day Return*
Six advances to become seven, and retreats to become five. Five is the unfilled state of six, while six is the fulfilled state of five—surpassing it becomes seven. Six is the extreme. When one yang arises, the seventh day brings return; when two yang arise, the eighth month brings misfortune. Seven is lesser yang, eight is lesser yin. The sun is *Zhen*, the moon is *Dui*. Though *Lin* (Overseeing) grows in yang, it actually attains the number of eight *Dui*, hence it is said that misfortune comes in the eighth month. The *Fu* (Return) hexagram’s single yang returns on the seventh day—this is because *Kun*’s yin reaches its extreme in *hai*, the sixth number is exhausted at one, and return emerges from *Kan*, combining to make seven. The numbers are exhausted in the six *jia*, the cycles are exhausted in the three sequences, and return becomes the origin—this is also the meaning of the seven-day return.

*Diagram of Sincerity in Delusion*
*Zhong Fu* (Inner Sincerity) is trust. *Yuan Wang* (Delusion) is also trust. The trust of *Zhong Fu* is the natural sincerity of the self. The trust of *Yuan Wang* is compelled by external forces. Thus it is said: "The firm comes from without and becomes the master within." The Dao of sincerity and trust inherently arises from within, and the master also resides within. Now, if it comes from without to become the inner master, how can it be natural? This is how it differs from *Zhong Fu*.

*Diagram of the Spirit Turtle*
The center of *Yi* (Nourishment) is empty—this is the image of the spirit turtle. When the noble person sees it, he takes warning from the spirit turtle. When the petty person sees it, he drools with desire. The third line represents the lower teeth, the movement of biting, hence its misfortune is greater than that of the second and fifth lines. The reason the third line moves is due to the *Zhen* image of the initial line. *Li* as the turtle follows the same principle.

*Diagram of Ridgepole’s Strength and Weakness*
In the *Da Guo* (Great Exceeding) hexagram, good and ill fortune lie in the first and uppermost lines. The ridgepole’s strength relies on the thatch of earth’s reeds—this is the utmost caution. The ridgepole’s weakness relies on the water that drowns the wood—hence the *Da Guo* hexagram’s judgment appears in the third nine. Yang qi, when arrogant, becomes greatly excessive. The second nine is paired with lesser yin, thus it can sprout the shoots of the withered poplar.

The *sprout* is but the bud of the poplar. The fifth nine is paired with old yin, and the principle of generation is exhausted. Thus arises the image of the withered poplar’s blossoms—blossoms that cannot bear fruit, serving only as the first shoots of growth.

*Diagram of Practicing Danger in the Kan Hexagram*
The *Xiang* of the *Kan* hexagram states: "Only the heart is free." This heart harbors no thoughts of good or evil, no movements of joy, anger, sorrow, or delight. Once it enters into habituation, however, the same becomes altered into the different. Thus, the *Kan* hexagram, from beginning to end, presents the image of the petty person practicing danger to ensnare himself—a warning against the perils of the mind’s intent. Yin and yang are the origins of good and evil, the division of

The fourth yin position is occupied by a nine, which below corresponds to the initial six—hence the term "good," denoting mutual affinity, for a yin position exchanges with a yin line. The fifth yang position is occupied by a nine, which below corresponds to the second six—hence the term "excellent." "Excellent" signifies a consort, for a yang line in a yang position takes as consort a yin line in a yin position. When a yin consorts with me, it exchanges with me; if a petty person cannot be exchanged with, one severs ties—this is why it is auspicious. As a consort, she is but my proper mate, and cannot be severed. Thus, one need only rectify one’s intent, and licentiousness or perversity cannot enter—this is why it is "steadfastly auspicious."

*Diagram of the Ram Entangled in the Great Strength Hexagram*
In the *Great Strength* hexagram, four yang lines accumulate below, resembling the foundation of a hall’s pillars—hence the term "strength." Above is *Zhen*, below *Qian*; *Zhen* represents green bamboo, thus evoking the image of a fence. When the third nine of *Qian* transforms, it enters *Dui*, hence the image of a ram. *Dui* is west and *Zhen* east; *mao* and *you* directly oppose each other, thus forming the image of a ram butting against a fence. The initial line is the ram’s hoof. The ram uses its horns to butt, but if the hoofs exert their strength while the horns weaken, the hoofs become ensnared. The fourth nine is truly of my kind; if it were to breach the fence to open a great path, allowing the ram to advance without weakening, then the three yang lines below would instead become the crossbar of my chariot’s strength. This is why the second nine and fourth nine bear the words "steadfastly auspicious."

*Diagram of the Prosperous Marquis Kang*
Among the images of the eight trigrams, *Qian* truly represents the horse. In the *Advancement* hexagram, *Kun*’s steadfastness places a yin line in the fifth position—how could there be the image of a horse? Yet *Qian* bestows the horse, thereby leading to flourishing descendants; the image of the feudal lords is thus made clear. That it must be "brightness emerging above the earth" to symbolize the feudal lords is because fire above heaven forms the *Great Possession* hexagram, symbolizing the Son of Heaven. Both the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords are rulers who face south; they must possess bright virtue to pacify the people. When the people are at peace, their positions are secure—hence the term "Prosperous Marquis."

*Diagram of Viscount Ji in the Darkening of the Light Hexagram*
In the *Darkening of the Light* hexagram, the Sage’s commentary, through the *Xiang* and *Tuan*, is most illuminating and most evident in human affairs. The fifth line represents Viscount Ji, while the top line represents King Zhou. The third nine bears the words "hunting in the south and capturing a great chief"—is this not King Wu? "Rescuing the strong"—is this not King Wu’s ministers who aided in overthrowing the tyrannical minister? The fourth six, originally a line of *Kun*, yet below shares the human position with the third—is this not the submission of Prince Weizi and the Duke of Zhou to the Zhou? The initial nine and top six both dwell in the *Kan* water: wings drooping as if about to fly, provisions exhausted as if about to depart—does this not describe those who wished to rescue but lacked the strength, like Boyi and Shuqi?

*Diagram of the Image in the Household Hexagram*
Someone asked Master Wenzhong about the image in the *Household* hexagram. He replied: "Illuminating within and ordering without—this is the image of *Li* and *Xun*." Yet the image lies in one yin and one yang mutually consorting at the center, evoking the image of parents and husband and wife, its meaning derived from the Master’s *Xiang*. Jiao Yanshou took the top line as the ancestral temple and the fifth as the ruler. Applying this to the *Household* hexagram, the ruler’s position becomes the father. Confucius said: "In the *Household* hexagram, there is a stern ruler—this refers to the parents."

*Diagram of the Images in the Opposition Hexagram #15*
In the *Opposition* hexagram, all six lines are doubtful, for yin and yang mutually doubt each other. Yang occupies a yin position, thus positions give rise to doubt. The second responds to the fifth, yet the fifth clings to the top; the top responds to the third, yet the third clings to the second—thus responses give rise to doubt. Doubt leads to opposition and lack of harmony. Therefore, in the words for the six lines, the Sage resolves their doubts, allowing yin and yang each to settle in their proper positions. Thus, the images of things in the *Opposition* hexagram, compared to other hexagrams, are the most abundant—this is to exhaust its meaning.

*Diagram of Going and Coming in the Obstruction Hexagram*
In the *Obstruction* hexagram, the two yang lines are both trapped among yin, hence *Obstruction* concerns four instances of going and coming, while two do not involve going and coming. The four all lose the center, while the second and fifth both attain the center. By nourishing oneself with the center, though dwelling in obstruction, one is accustomed to hardship and moves through difficulty—what going and coming could there be? The fifth, in the center of the upper position, skillfully dwells in obstruction without overstepping below, causing others to gladly submit—this is why it brings friends and does not stand alone in peril. The second, in the center of the lower position, skillfully dwells in obstruction without clinging to above, taking responsibility without regard to self—this is why it ultimately incurs no blame and gains a response from the three yang lines that have lost the center. Thus, it is exhorted to turn inward and cultivate virtue. The four yin lines have lost the center, hence they are exhorted to connect with the two yang lines. The initial line is below, thus it is encouraged to cultivate its reputation and not act recklessly. The top line is near the fifth, thus it is encouraged to seek fulfillment and follow the great person.

*Diagram of Emerging from the Kan Peril*
The single yang within *Kan* is the single yang below *Zhen*; initially enveloped within *Kan*, it later emerges above *Kan* and moves below *Zhen*, like the kernel of a fruit transforming into a sprout—hence the term "obtaining the yellow arrow." The arrow represents centered straightness. With centered straightness, the sprout emerges. Though the hexagram’s yin and yang are in disorder and not in their proper positions, the top line bears the image of resolving disorder, for *Zhen* resides in *Kan*. When the noble person is bent below and mingles with petty men, their heart of spreading virtue is not forgotten. Once they escape the periphery and depart, they extend their aspirations. This is why the fourth nine and sixth three bear the image of the big toe—a warning for the noble person.

*Diagram of Using the Center in Decrease and Increase*
*(From the Sixteenth Volume of the Daoist Canon of China)*

The *Xiang* commentaries of both hexagrams speak of "moving in accord with the times." The lines of both hexagrams speak of "the tortoise of ten cowries." To speak of "the times" means that when the time calls for decrease, one decreases, and the world does not deem it stingy; when the time calls for increase, one increases, and the world does not deem it extravagant. To speak of "the tortoise" means that when tortoise and milfoil divination align, ministers and the people offer no resistance.

Now, to decide a diagram by removing five yang and eliminating one yin—five gentlemen and casting out one petty man—is not difficult. Yet when yin clings to the five positions, attaching itself to both the fifth and fourth lines, this forms the *Dui* hexagram, what is called "yin enfolding yang" and "petty men clinging to gentlemen." This is why it is difficult to rank and difficult to remove.

The ram of *Dazhuang* exerts its strength upon *Zhen*. *Zhen* is of the same kind. The ram of *Guai* exerts itself upon *Dui*. *Dui* is not of the same kind; only when it transforms me does it become aligned. This is why the fourth line bears the image of "leading the ram," for it is through the transformation of these two lines that the ram’s image arises.

*Gouyu Diagram*
Observing the primary line in its original form reveals the image of a pig, with the ninth line in the third position as its rump. Viewing the first, second, and fourth lines together reveals the image of a fish, signifying yang enfolding yin. Observing the ninth line in the fifth position reveals the image of melon vines flourishing.

*Gou* is fundamentally *Qian*. When one yin transforms its initial line, the dragon reverts to the image of a fish—"the dragon transforms into a fish, and its horns become useless." This is why the horns of *Shen* reach upward to their limit.

The single yang of *Qian* arises at *zi* and concludes at *si*. *Si* truly resides in the *Xun* direction. Thus, the six yang lines of *Qian* encounter *Xun* at the *si* position, and the single yin of *Xun* begins to sprout. This birth of yin is why it is named *Shen*.

*Cuiju Diagram*
In *Cui*, the first and top lines enfold two yang and two yin within, resembling things gathering by kind. Yang occupies the south-facing position: one as the Son of Heaven, one as the feudal lord. Below, they govern the Three Dukes, twenty-seven ministers, and eighty-one knights; above, they uphold the solemnity of ancestral temples and guard against the chaos of the multitude. Thus, the first line’s warning against losing the two multitudes is embedded in the top line.

*Cui* signifies things gathering as they ripen in autumn. Autumn is ruled by *Dui*, whose hexagram is fundamentally governed by the top line. Now, the *kun* qi of the southwest moves to the west, and the yin lines multiply. Thus, the two yang lines govern them, and the top line loses the multitude.

*End of the Middle Volume of Zhouyi Diagrams*

The first yin of *Xun* is one with the three yins of *Kun*. Yin is heavy and stagnant, while yang ascends and soars. Initially, it clings to the two yangs to rise, and the three yins become one with them, hence the image of *Yunsheng* ("trustworthy ascent"). *Yun* signifies being seen as trustworthy by others. *Kun* governs the *hai* position, and *hai* is also where wood begins to grow, though its form is not yet manifest. At the *zi* position, *Zhen* resides below *Kun*. *Zhen* is also wood, the first root and sprout of wood. If *Xun* resides below *Kun*, there are two yangs, unlike *Zhen*’s single yang in its initial sprouting, hence it is called *Sheng* ("Ascent"). *Sheng* occupies the *chou* position, and by *mao*, wood flourishes. The outer trigram speaks of position, and the fifth is the celestial position, which cannot be ascended by mere steps. Yet *zhen* means "upright." Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang ascended the celestial position with rectitude, like ascending a peaceful stairway. If not by *zhen*, would one rather stumble in reckless ascent?

**Diagram of Ten Thousand Vines and Trees in the Hexagram *Kun***
The hexagram *Kun* pertains to the ninth month, when the *Dui* qi governs and approaches the *xu* earth. Marsh water is dammed by earth, hence the *Great Image* states: "The marsh has no water; *Kun*." The hexagram is formed by the overlapping of *Dui* and *Kan*. *Dui* represents autumn, while *Kan* represents winter. The single yin of *Dui* symbolizes the beginning of autumn’s qi, when creeping vines have not yet withered, hence the entanglement of ten thousand vines. The sixth line of the third position marks the transition between autumn and winter, where vines shed their leaves but thorns remain, hence the entanglement of lush blossoms. As for the first line of the sixth position, it lies at the bottom of *Kan*, precisely the time of deep winter. Vines are killed by frost, leaving none behind, and only bare trunks remain. This is the reason for the three yin lines of the hexagram *Kun*. #1 This is explained through the imagery of plants and trees.

**Diagram of the Dual Functions of Water and Fire in *Jing* and *Ding***
In *Jing* ("The Well"), yang is the spring, for water is born from the yang of Heaven’s One. The yang within *Kan* emerges from the cold spring of the north. The north generates cold, and cold generates water. Of *Xun*’s two yangs, one is at the earth position, rushing downward to enter the valley—this is not a well. The other yang, though at the human position, lies below the well-rope, unreachable by drawing, and is not as good as the fifth line, which overflows above the well-rope. A well desires to overflow, while a *ding* ("cauldron") warns against fullness—this is the distinction between virtue and vessel. In the hexagram *Ding*, the handles, ears, and legs are all complete, except one leg is missing, which is why the first line speaks of "the cauldron overturning its legs," meaning the cauldron is inverted with its legs above. The single yin below forms the image of two ears. The fifth line is called "yellow ears," distinguishing it from the first line.

**Diagram of the Forge, Crucible, and Casting in *Ge***
Though *Ge* ("Revolution") bears the image of a *ding* cauldron transforming raw to cooked, its true essence lies in the image of the forge. This is because *Li* fire forges *Dui* metal, and metal follows revolution. After revolution comes the *ding*, for it is cast into a cauldron through forging. The Xia sovereigns cast cauldrons, and Tang and Wu followed suit, treasuring these vessels, hence the image of Tang and Wu’s revolutionary mandate. Yao and Shun ascended the throne with rectitude, like ascending a peaceful stairway.

**Diagram of the Moving Heart in *Zhen***
Of *Zhen*’s six lines, the first urges caution and fear before speaking of laughter; the second warns against losing wealth and not pursuing it. This is to prevent inner recklessness in the heart and outer greed for profit. The third speaks of *susu* ("trembling"), urging one to examine hidden faults and discern delusions, lest one ultimately fall into confusion—all are essential to the moving heart. The outer trigram discusses the boundaries of movement: "loss" signifies the completion of affairs, while the top line’s "inauspicious advance" warns against failure.

**Diagram of the Back in *Gen***
The image of *Gen* speaks of cheeks and jaws but not the mouth, of the body but not the belly, of the spine and waist but not the navel—it presents the image of standing with one’s back turned, hence it is said: "*Gen* its back." Observing the entire hexagram, the lower part does not distinguish calf or toe, nor does the upper part separate body or spine. The four yins are arranged like a backbone. The top yang is the shoulder, and the middle yang is the spine, which merely runs through the center. The ninth line of the third position is the master of *Gen*, with yang in a yang position, its nature restless and moving—like the waist. When it bends or moves, it truly strikes the heart, hence the image of a heart consumed by fire. The sixth line of the second position, with yin in a yin position, is inherently still, #2 hence the image of the calf. If the heart desires movement but the calf does not lift to walk, how can there be joy? Thus, the sage appends the words "its heart is not pleased."

**Diagram of the Wild Geese’s North-South Migration in *Jian***
The hexagram *Jian* ("Gradual Progress"), with *Gen* below and *Xun* above, corresponds to the period after the *lichun* ("Beginning of Spring") in the first month, when wild geese gradually arrive. Hence, all six lines are associated with geese. Geese are birds that follow the yang. Since *Gen* and *Xun* are bounded by the yang of *zi* and *wu*, it is fitting to associate them with geese. The third line resides at the top of *Gen*, and the top line at the top of *Xun*—these are the southern and northern lands. The third line, with one yang amid many yins, coincides with the time when wild geese migrate north and beasts begin to mate, hence the image of a husband traveling while his wife is pregnant. It also interacts with the fourth line at the human position, hence pregnancy. As for the fifth and second lines, one resides in heaven and the other on earth, far apart yet distinct as male and female, hence they do not conceive.

**Diagram of the Sleeves of the Lord and Concubine in *Guimei***
*Zhen* represents green bamboo, hollow above and solid below—like a basket. The hexagram *Guimei* ("Marrying Maiden") resembles *Tai*, with the two lines at the human position intersecting, forming the image of overlapping sleeves. The body’s left is yang and right is yin; their intersection is like two sleeves crossing. The concubine occupies the lower position, its line yang; the lord occupies the upper position, its line yin. The *Book of Changes* regards yang as good and yin as evil, yang as noble and yin as base. Thus, the lord’s sleeve is not as good as the concubine’s sleeve, for a woman’s conduct is not upright.

The hexagram shifts the yang of the eastern quarter to join the yin of the western quarter—this is the qi of *Zhen* entering *Dui*, wood being constrained by metal. Thus, it is only auspicious near the full moon. If one marches forth, it is inauspicious; there is nothing to be gained, for one’s conduct is not upright.

**Diagram of the Dipper Visible at Midday in *Feng***
When Fuxi placed *Zhen* in the east and *Li* in the south, he signified that the lesser yang’s qi stirs in the east while the greater yang’s brilliance flourishes in the south. King Wen doubled *Zhen* with *Li* and named it *Feng* ("Abundance"), for the lesser yang’s *Zhen* movement reaches the south, uniting with the greater yang’s *Li* brightness to achieve fullness. Thus, in the *Feng* hexagram, King Wen illustrated the principle that extreme abundance must decline, saying it is fitting for the sun to be at its zenith; in the *Feng* lines, he showed that extreme brightness must darken, speaking of the sun at midday revealing the Dipper and the faint stars. The judgments King Wen appended to the hexagram and lines concern only the sun and the Dipper. Why, then, did Confucius in the *Xiang* commentary discuss the moon? Because *Feng* falls at the cusp of the fifth and sixth months, when the sun is in the degree of the Willow constellation and the Dipper points between noon and the *wei* position. The Willow’s degree spans three celestial markers, hence the possibility of seeing the Dipper.

**Diagram of Temporary Lodging in *Lü***
The second line, by following the central Way, carries resources and gains servants. The fourth line, through the harmonious blending of firm and yielding with resonance, obtains the resource of an axe. Both secure nearby advantages, yet neither matches the fifth line. The reason *Li* brings clarity is that it proceeds with wisdom in compliance; thus, it says, "Tending a cow brings good fortune." The top line’s loss of the ox signifies the loss of its brightness. *Lü* follows *Guai* and precedes *Qian*, when yang flourishes as guest qi, hence the name *Lü* ("Travel"). The top line, wielding power as the host, lodges itself atop blazing flames yet remains unaware of the disaster of a burning nest. The third line, hastening toward the blaze in restless advance, does not foresee the calamity of its lodging consumed by fire. Though the second and fourth lines travel by the yielding Way—one carrying resources, the other obtaining an axe—both gain advantage in their time, yet the second must act with its person to avoid error, while the fourth’s heart remains unsettled. Is this not a warning against seeking profit while traveling? As for the fifth line, it begins with the pheasant of *Li*, adorned with the beauty of civil brilliance, yet when shot, the arrow is lost, and the bird is not retrieved—this is the Way’s failure to proceed.

**Diagram of the Forest Beneath in *Xun***
*Xun* takes yang as the forest’s canopy and yin as the forest’s roots. The form resembles a pig’s legs below, while the four yang lines in motion evoke the image of a basket. The second line marks the forest’s eastern boundary, and the top line marks its western boundary, hence both are said to be *Xun* beneath the form, with the forest’s roots attached. The fifth line is *Qian*’s fifth line, the flying dragon, which transforms into the tiger. The flying dragon corresponds to *jia*; the tiger’s transformation corresponds to *geng*—this is but a shift within the same qi. The top line’s loss of the axe stems from excessive firmness. The second line employs scribes and shamans due to its firm centrality yet lack of proper position. The third line’s frequent frowns arise from its excess and loss of the center. From this, we see that authority is exercised by one who holds position and attains the center. If not the fifth line, then who?

**Diagram of the Image in *Dui***
The initial line of *Kan* governs the winter solstice; the initial line of *Li* governs the summer solstice. The initial lines of *Zhen* and *Dui* govern the spring and autumn equinoxes. Thus, in *Dui*, the lower two lines, where yang qi is especially abundant, represent the seventh month; the middle two lines, where yin and yang are evenly divided, represent the eighth month; and the upper two lines, where yin surpasses yang, represent the ninth month. This is why the *Dui* hexagram’s four lines speak of "trading joy," revealing the notes of *Zhen*’s horn, *Li*’s zither, and *Kan*’s flute; its fifth line speaks of "sincere stripping," illustrating the principles of *Zhen*’s *fu*, *Li*’s *gou*, *Kan*’s *fu*, and *Gen*’s *fu*.

**Diagram of the Body Dissolving in *Huan***
One yang arises at *zi*, and six yangs reach their peak at *si*. *Zi* belongs to *Kan*, and *si* to *Xun*; *Xun* doubled with *Kan* forms *Huan*. *Huan* means "dissolution." The hexagram’s qi corresponds to the period after the summer solstice and before the great heat, when yang qi disperses outward. Though yang disperses externally, within it lies the inexhaustible source of generation—this is the one yang within *Kan*, akin to human primordial qi. Yang governs qi, yin governs form; one yang disperses outward, hence the mention of sweat and blood. Two yins divide within, hence the mention of the body and its parts. The body divides into the four limbs; the parts divide into the five viscera and six bowels—all formed by the dispersion of primordial qi. Primordial qi emerges from *Kan* water, the essence of Heaven’s One, steaming into sweat, flowing into blood, nourishing the four limbs and five viscera.

**Diagram of Seasonal Nodes in *Jie***
The one yang of *Dui* draining downward presents the image of caution against desire. The one yin of *Kan* rising upward presents the image of caution against indulgence. Caution against desire leads to "not going beyond the door and courtyard." Caution against indulgence leads to the flavors of sweet and bitter. When the initial line changes, it becomes *Kan*. Heaven’s One water is the source of true essence; if the noble person is careful and secretive, not venturing out, closing the gate of essence, this is the key to nurturing life. The second line of *Kan* is fire; the door and courtyard represent the openings of the heart. The heart’s fire is noble when it descends to aid water; the heart’s brightness is noble when it shines outward upon things. Not venturing out loses the central Way—this, too, is the meaning of caution against desire. The third line speaks of sighing, regret without restraint. The fourth line speaks of peace, contentment in restraint—both clearly reveal where advantage and harm lie.

The Way of nurturing life culminates in *Huan*.

**Diagram of *Zhong Fu* and *Xiao Guo*: Eggs Nurturing Life and Growth**
*Zhong Fu* generates yang—feathered creatures are born from eggs.
The *Xian* hexagram generates yin—creatures of blood and flesh are born from wombs.
Thus, *Zhong Fu* marks the inception of yang’s generation, while *Xiao Guo* signifies its completion.
Birds and sparrows lay eggs throughout the four seasons, but most abundantly in spring, hence it serves as the image of the Beginning of Spring. The eggs of the Winter Solstice are also present.
*Zhong Fu* embodies the image of avian eggs.
Birds, by nature, ascend in flame, yet they require the offering of pig and fish to attain auspiciousness.
Water resides in the northern *zi* position—the domain of pig and fish.
The misfortune of *Xiao Guo*’s flying birds entangled in nets arises from their eastward flight toward the center, where the snares of the southern direction lie.
These snares capture the *Li* yang, and upon reaching *Li*, yang becomes excessive, giving rise to yin.

**Diagram of *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* Harmonized with Pitch Pipes**
The Yellow Emperor’s pitch pipes divide into *Qian* and *Kun*, then pair as *Kan* and *Li*.
*Qian* and *Kun* separate into six yin and six yang lines, while *Kan* and *Li* form *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*.
The yang within *Kan* ascends to reach *Zhong Lü*, and the hexagram unfolds as *Qian*—this is called *Qian*’s "nine in fullness, its head unseen."
The yin within *Li* has entered *Kan* and extends to *Ying Zhong*, and the hexagram unfolds as *Kun*—this is called *Kun*’s "ten in emptiness, guiding the latent dragon’s qi."
The inception of *Ji Ji* is the inception of *Qian*.
The conclusion of *Wei Ji* is the conclusion of *Kun*.
*Qian*’s end connects to *Kun*’s end—nine followed by ten.
*Kun*’s beginning follows *Qian*’s beginning—two preceding one.
All is the principle of nature.

**Diagram of Like Gathering by Direction**
*Kan* is the north; *Qian* gathers with water’s completion number in the northwest.
*Zhen* is the east; *Gen* gathers with wood’s completion number in the northeast.
*Li* is due south; *Xun* gathers with fire’s generation number in the southeast.
*Dui* is due west; *Kun* gathers with metal’s generation number in the southwest.
Thus, the eight trigrams each gather by their respective directions according to kind.

**Diagram of Things Divided by Groups**
All that moves in the world cannot be straight, for it inclines toward yang.
All that is planted cannot move, for it inclines toward yin.
Things of yin and yang are thus divided into groups by these qualities.
Only humans can both move and stand upright, and both be planted yet move—thereby possessing the fullness of yin and yang.
This is why they surpass all creatures in spirit and are set apart.

**Diagram of Interlocking Changes through Three and Five**
Wang Dabao said: "Three interlocked form *can*; five interwoven form *wu*."
Using the lines of *Qian* to interlock with those of *Kun* transforms them into *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*.
Using the lines of *Kun* to interlock with those of *Qian* transforms them into *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*.
This is what is meant by "interlocking to transform"—the image of heaven and earth uniting their powers, yin and yang interacting.
One pairs with nine, two with eight, three with seven, four with six, and five with five—these are called "ranks," combining to form the Great Expansion’s number of fifty. This is what is meant by "interweaving to transform."

**Diagram of Three Heaven and Two Earth**
Geng Nanzhong said: "Three of heaven—heaven one, heaven three, heaven five—sum to nine.
Two of earth—earth two and earth four—combine to six.
When casting milfoil stalks, seven, nine, eight, and six are all employed.
Yet when forming hexagrams, seven is set aside for nine, and eight for six.
Relying on one side is called 'biased numbers.'"

**Diagram of *Qian* and *Kun* Harmonized with Pitch Pipes**
Zheng’s commentary on the *Rites of Zhou* states: "The pitch pipes generate one another, structured by the six bodies of yin and yang."
Yellow Bell’s first nine below generates Forest Bell’s first six; Forest Bell then generates Great Budding’s first two above.
Great Budding then generates Southern Bell’s six two below; Southern Bell then generates Maiden Purity’s nine three above.
Maiden Purity then generates Responding Bell’s six three below; Responding Bell then generates Luxuriant’s nine four above.
Luxuriant then generates Great Bell’s six four below; Great Bell then generates Level Standard’s nine five above.
Level Standard then generates Cleaving Bell’s six five below; Cleaving Bell then generates Without End’s top nine above.
Without End then generates Central Bell’s top six below—thus Central Bell regenerates Yellow Bell, completing the cycle.

**Diagram of Hexagrams Divided by Pitch Pipes**
Yang said: "In the eleventh month, *Fu*’s single yang arises, corresponding to Yellow Bell’s qi. By the fourth month, six yangs form *Qian*—hence the opening of the door is called *Qian*.
In the fifth month, *Gou*’s single yin arises, corresponding to Luxuriant’s qi. By the tenth month, six yins form *Kun*—hence the closing of the door is called *Kun*."

**Diagram of Four Images and Eight Trigrams**
Fan Kuichang said: "The Four Images, in terms of form, are water, fire, wood, and metal; in terms of numbers, they are old yang, old yin, young yang, and young yin—nine, six, seven, and eight.
Only earth lacks form; when the Four Images each pair with central earth, they become the completion numbers of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*.
Water’s number is six, so three lines form *Kan*, and the remaining three lines are distributed above *hai* to form *Qian*.
Metal’s number is nine; subtracting three lines forms *Dui*, and the remaining six lines are distributed above *wei* to form *Kun*.
Fire’s number is seven; subtracting three lines forms *Li*, and the remaining four lines are distributed above *si* to form *Xun*.
Wood’s number is eight; subtracting three lines forms *Zhen*, and the remaining five lines are distributed above *yin* to form *Gen*.
Thus, the Four Images generate the eight trigrams."

**Diagram of Using Nine and Using Six**
Zheng Hou said: "One, three, five, seven, and nine are all yang numbers, yet only the yang line uses nine.
Two, four, six, eight, and ten are all yin numbers, yet only the yin line uses six."

Why is this so? Nine is the utmost of yang numbers; when utmost, it can transform. Yang governs transformation, thus only the *Qian* hexagram uses nine. Six is the mean of yin numbers; the mean abides in constancy. Yin governs constancy, thus only the *Kun* hexagram uses six.

Moreover, one, three, and five sum to nine—these are the generative numbers of Heaven. Two and four sum to six—these are the generative numbers of Earth. That which generates life is called *Change*, thus *Qian* and *Kun* employ these numbers.

**Diagram of Qian and Kun as the Great Father and Mother**
*Qian* first transforms into *Gou*, then into *Dun*, then into *Pi*, and by the fifth transformation becomes *Bo*, where it halts. Things cannot be utterly exhausted; when *Bo* reaches its extremity above, it turns back below, thus it is followed by *Fu*. *Kun* first transforms into *Fu*, then into *Lin*, then into *Tai*, and by the fifth transformation becomes *Guai*, where it halts. *Guai* must meet its counterpart, thus it is followed by *Gou*.

**Diagram of Fu and Gou as the Lesser Father and Mother**
One yang arrives in *Fu*; transforming into *Lin*, it becomes two yang; transforming into *Tai*, it becomes four yang; transforming into *Dazhuang*, it becomes eight yang; transforming into *Guai*, it becomes fourteen yang. Its transformation culminates in *Guimei*, completing sixteen yang. One yin begins in *Gou*; transforming into *Dun*, it becomes two yin; transforming into *Pi*, it becomes four yin; transforming into *Guan*, it becomes eight yin; transforming into *Bo*, it becomes fourteen yin. Its transformation culminates in *Sui*, completing sixteen yin.

**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams Governing Transformation**

**Diagram of the Five Positions Mutually Attaining Their Unions**

Nie Shi states: The odd numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—are the singularities of yang. The even numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—are the pairs of yin. The five positions attain one another through yin and yang, each possessing its union. That which is born of yang is completed by yin; that which is born of yin is completed by yang. Thus, the heavenly number is twenty-five, and the earthly number is thirty, by which transformations are accomplished and the spirits operate.

**Diagram of the Eighteen Changes Completing the Hexagrams**

The union of male and female: In the *Upper* and *Lower Canons*, there are only twelve positions. The proper positions are the eight hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Xian*, *Heng*, *Sun*, and *Yi*. These are divided into eighteen positions:
- *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Yi* and *Daguo*;
- *Yi* and *Daguo* transform into *Kan* and *Li*;
- *Kan* and *Li* transform into *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo*;
- *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* transform into *Xian* and *Heng*, completing human relations.

**Diagram of the Thirteen Hexagrams Taking Their Images**

The doubling of *Li* contains the body of *Xun*. *Xun* is the cord, *Li* is the eye; the mesh of the net is called the *gu*, thus possessing the image of nets and traps, serving the purposes of hunting and fishing.
- *Xun* wood moves forward, forming the image of the *wei*.
- *Zhen* wood moves behind, forming the image of the *si*, manifesting in the use of plows and plowshares.
- *Li* is the sun at midday; *Li* originally belongs to *Kun*, and *Kun* as the multitude forms the market.
- *Zhen* below, where hard and soft first interact, thus takes the image of exchange.
- *Qian* heaven above, thus is clothing.
- *Kun* earth below, thus is the lower garment—this is the sage’s "hanging of robes and skirts to govern the world," reflecting the non-action of *Qian* and *Kun*.
- *Xun* is wood, *Kan* is water; wood upon water forms the image of boats and oars, serving to cross that which is impassable.
- *Dui* originally belongs to *Kun* and is the ox; *Zhen* is the moving foot of the horse. Harnessing the ox and riding the horse provide the benefit of drawing heavy loads over great distances.
- The inner door is called *Kun*. *Zhen* moves it, possessing the image of striking the watchman’s clapper, serving to guard against violent intruders.
- *Zhen* moves above, *Gen* halts below—this is the image of pestle and mortar, serving the needs of the myriad people.
- *Li* is silk, *Dui* is the inversion of *Xun* wood, possessing the image of the bow. Carving straight wood into arrows serves to overawe the world.
- *Zhen* wood is the ridgepole, *Qian* heaven is the roof—thus forming the image of *Dazhuang*.
- *Xun* wood lies beneath the marsh, with four yang residing within—this is the image of the coffin and bier.
- *Dui* originally belongs to *Kun*; *Kun* is pattern, and *Qian* decisively hardens it—thus forming the image of written contracts.

*The Collected Sayings* states: The ancient sages’ creation of implements followed patterns, all possessing inner and outer doubled images, and their uses were likewise doubled. Nets and traps, plows and plowshares, market goods, robes and skirts, boats and oars, oxen and horses, gates and watchman’s clappers, pestles and mortars, bows and arrows, ridgepoles and roofs, coffins and biers, written contracts—these are the doubled images. Hunting and fishing, plowing and weeding, exchange, the hanging of robes and skirts, crossing the impassable, drawing heavy loads over great distances, guarding against violent intruders, serving the myriad people, overawing the world, withstanding wind and rain, governing the hundred officials, observing the myriad people, and marking the mourning period for the deceased—these are also doubled images.

**Chen Shi’s Three Arrangements of the Nine Hexagrams**

**First Arrangement:**
- *Lǚ* is the foundation of virtue;
- *Qiān* is the handle of virtue;
- *Fù* is the root of virtue;
- *Héng* is the firmness of virtue;
- *Sǔn* is the cultivation of virtue;
- *Yì* is the enrichment of virtue;
- *Kùn* is the abundance of virtue;
- *Jǐng* is the ground of virtue;
- *Xùn* is the regulation of virtue.

**Second Arrangement:**
- *Lǚ* arrives in harmony;
- *Qiān* is reverent and radiant;
- *Héng* is small yet discerning in things;
- *Sǔn* is mixed yet not wearying;
- *Yì* is difficult first, then easy;
- *Kùn* is long-abundant yet not contrived;
- *Jǐng* is exhausted yet penetrating;
- *Xùn* abides in its place yet moves;
- *Qiān* is measured yet concealed.

**Third Arrangement:**
- *Lǚ* acts in harmony;
- *Qiān* regulates ritual;
- *Fù* knows itself;
- *Héng* unifies virtue;
- *Sǔn* distances harm;
- *Yì* promotes benefit;
- *Kùn* arouses advantage;
- *Jǐng* reduces resentment;
- *Xùn* discerns rightness;
- *Qiān* exercises authority.

Hīnayāna says: The *Dragon Diagram* scattered the heavens to reveal it; Fuxi gathered and employed it; Confucius silently gave it form. The three arrangements of the nine virtues explore its meaning—thus is it known.
- Therefore, *Lǚ* is the foundation of virtue, illuminating the use of ten;
- *Qiān* is the handle of virtue, illuminating the use of fifteen—also illuminating that the five uses lie in *Qiān*;
- *Fù* is the root of virtue, illuminating the use of twenty-four.
Thus, the three hexagrams belong to the *Upper Canon*, illuminating that the use of *Qian* is subsumed under *Kun*; the six hexagrams belong to the *Lower Canon*, illuminating that the use of *Kun* is encompassed by *Qian*. This is the meaning of heaven’s three-threes and earth’s two-twos.

**Diagram of the Sequence of Hexagrams**

Hanshang states: King Wen composed the *Yijing*, taking *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the uses of the *Upper Canon*, and *Gen*, *Dui*, *Zhen*, and *Xun* as the uses of the *Lower Canon*. The *Upper Canon* concludes with *Kan* and *Li*; the *Lower Canon* concludes with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. *Yi*, *Daguo*, *Xiaoguo*, and *Zhongfu* are the norm for the two canons.
- *Qian* and *Kun* are the root of the *Yi*.
- *Kan* and *Li* are the uses of *Qian* and *Kun*.
- *Li* resembles *Qian*; *Kan* resembles *Kun*; *Zhongfu* resembles *Qian*; *Xiaoguo* resembles *Kun*; *Yi* resembles *Li*; *Daguo* resembles *Kan*.

**Jiji** is the union of *Kan* and *Li*. **Weiji** is the convergence of *Kan* and *Li*. That *Kan* and *Li* serve as the uses of *Qian* and *Kun* is because they attain the mean of heaven and earth. Thus the sage responds to intoxication without bias, and in a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, never strays from this mean.

Master Kangjie said: How profound was King Wen’s composition of the *Yijing*—did he not grasp the uses of heaven and earth? Only with the Master’s *Sequence of Hexagrams* was the ceaseless generation of life fully illuminated, and the essence of heaven and earth exhausted. Thus, the *Upper Canon* encompasses heaven, earth, and the myriad things, completing the human Dao; the *Lower Canon* completes the human Dao, thereby perfecting heaven, earth, and the myriad things. How could this be a one-sided bias?

Han Kangbo read the *Sequence of Hexagrams* yet failed to perceive this.

**Diagram of Miscellaneous Hexagrams**
Hanshang said: The *Miscellaneous Hexagrams* focuses on the interplay of firmness and yielding, ascent and descent, reversal and recurrence to derive its meaning. It interweaves the hexagrams to unfold their boundless uses, so that even if a sage were to arise a hundred generations later, he would not go beyond this.

Shao Kangjie said: *Qian* and *Kun* undergo three changes; *Kan* and *Li* remain unmoved. This refers to the collapse from *Daguo* onward, but the later bamboo slips are disordered. For that day:
- *Yi* is the rectification of the usurper;
- *Daguo* is collapse;
- *Gou* is encounter (originally written as *shen*, meaning "pregnancy"), the yielding encountering the firm;
- *Guai* is severance, the firm deciding the yielding—here the Dao of the noble person flourishes, while the Dao of the petty person declines;
- *Jian* is the woman’s return awaiting the man’s journey;
- *Guimei* is the woman’s end;
- *Jiji* is settlement;
- *Weiji* is the man’s exhaustion.

This is the text.

**The Great Expansion Number**
Han Kangbo said: The number of the Great Expansion is used with forty-nine, while one is not used. Though unused, it is employed to achieve penetration; though not a number, it is through it that numbers are completed—this is the *Taiji* of the *Yi*. Forty-nine, when gathered, becomes one; when dispersed, becomes forty-nine—thus the *Taiji* is within it.

Master Liu said: Movement and stillness share a single source; the manifest and the subtle are without distinction. To know the use of forty-nine as one is to know the substance of one as forty-nine. Some seek to reconcile the number fifty with the heavenly stems, earthly branches, celestial lodges, eight trigrams, and yin-yang—this is likely mistaken.

**Method of Divining with Milfoil Stalks**
First division, second division, third division—first suspend from the little finger’s gap: not five, then nine.
Second suspend from the middle finger’s gap; third suspend from the index finger’s gap: in both cases, not four, then eight.

Five, four, four: old yang.
Su Dongpo said: Three divisions all yielding the lesser is the image of *Qian*. The sum of three lesser numbers is thirteen. Subtracting thirteen from forty-nine stalks leaves thirty-six, which is the number of four nines—this is old yang.

Nine, eight, eight: old yin.
Three divisions all yielding the greater is the image of *Kun*. The sum of three greater numbers is twenty-five. Subtracting twenty-five from forty-nine stalks leaves twenty-four, which is the number of four sixes—this is old yin.

Five, eight, eight: young yang.
One lesser and two greater divisions is the image of *Zhen*.

Nine, four, eight: young yang.
One greater, one lesser, and again one greater division is the image of *Kan*.

Nine, eight, four: young yang.
Two greater and one lesser division is the image of *Gen*.
In all cases where two are greater and one is lesser, the sum is twenty-one. Subtracting twenty-one from forty-nine stalks leaves twenty-eight, which is the number of four sevens—thus all are young yang.

Nine, four, four: young yang.
One greater and two lesser divisions is the image of *Xun*.

Five, eight, four: young yin.
One lesser, one greater, and again one lesser division is the image of *Li*.

Five, four, eight: young yin.
Two lesser and one greater division is the image of *Dui*.
In all cases where two are lesser and one is greater, the sum is seventeen. Subtracting seventeen from forty-nine stalks leaves thirty-two, which is the number of four eights—thus all are young yin.

**Diagram of the *Tai Xuan* Aligned with the *Yi***

**Diagram of the *Ni Xuan Dongji Jing* by Guan Ziming**

When Heaven and Earth open, the myriad things are born. Born, they must first sprout, then rest;
resting, they blossom; blossoming, they flourish. Yet things do not remain forever flourishing—thus they can come to stillness.
Still, then they find tranquility; tranquil, they attain their warmth. Warm, they bear fruit; fruitful, they become resources.
Resources must have their use; used, then they reach fulfillment. Fulfilled, they can rise; rising, they can be elevated. Elevated, they become disordered—yet nothing remedies disorder like stillness. Still, they can be nurtured.
Nurtured, then they achieve harmony; harmonious, they gain order. Ordered, things do not remain forever harmonious.
Prolonged harmony leads to obstruction; obstruction must give rise to action. Acting, they approach correctness.
Utmost correctness must be restrained; restrained, they enter obscurity. Yet things do not remain forever obscure—thus they end in penetration.

*Huangji Jingshi Xiantianshu Tu*
This diagram was expounded by Master Shao Kangjie.
All numbers of antiquity and the present begin with one, yet the numbers of the *Huangji* truly originate from Fu Xi’s *Xiantian*.
*Qian* is one, *Dui* two, *Li* three, *Zhen* four, *Xun* five, *Kan* six, *Gen* seven, *Kun* eight—these are the generative numbers of the eight trigrams.
Yang is one and yin two; thus, the generation of yin from yang is two multiplied by six, yielding twelve.
The generation of yang from yin is three multiplied by ten, yielding thirty.
Therefore, *Qian* begins as one, and *Dui* becomes twelve; *Li* becomes twelve multiplied by thirty, yielding three hundred sixty; *Zhen* becomes twelve multiplied by thirty-six, yielding four thousand three hundred twenty.
From *Xun* to *Kun*, all are the generative numbers of the odd and even.
When expanded into sixty-four hexagrams, the numbers are multiplied by their generated values to know the total sum.
For example, *Dui*’s *Zhen* yields the number one hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred twenty.
The cyclic generation of numbers among the sixty-four hexagrams follows this pattern.
If the sun, moon, stars, celestial stems, water, fire, earth, minerals, heat, cold, day, night, flying creatures, walking creatures, grasses, and trees are assigned to the eight trigrams, one may know their generative numbers and thus understand their generation; one may know their transformative numbers and thus understand their transformation.
For the scholar, profound contemplation of this will yield understanding.
