**Preface to *The Cultivation of the True and Supreme Polarity Primordial Unity Chart***

The Golden Elixir is the untransmitted secret of the supreme sages, the true source of the Great Dao, encompassing heaven and earth. Vast beyond all externality, minute beyond all internality, its movements are unfathomable. It establishes heaven and earth, and is shared alike by humanity. Yet it is not that the sages withheld its transmission and blocked the immortal path—rather, the world’s people have grown shallow and degenerate, their karmic affinities too meager to receive it. The scriptures state: it is transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas, not out of celestial stinginess, but because it must be entrusted to the right person, and thus cannot be lightly disclosed. From the Three Clarities above to the supreme sages in the middle and the host of immortals below, all attained sagehood through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. How could it not be secret?

I, by virtue of karmic blessings from past lives, have been favored with a master’s guidance, not through any merit of my own. For years, my resolve remained unwavering, and I wandered far and wide, seeking the transmission of the supreme Dao. At last, I encountered my late master, who took pity on my diligence and toil. He bestowed upon me the secrets of the returning fire of metal and flame, the knife-point and the cinnabar tally, and the mysteries of the alchemical flame. Overjoyed beyond measure, I returned to test and refine them. In a single breath, the Dragon and Tiger contended, shaking the Kunlun Mountains, surpassing Fusang, and tracing the path of the Yellow Emperor. Wondrous indeed!

Yet how laughable are today’s students, who fail to grasp the source of the Great Dao, seeking only emptiness and quiescence, mistaking these for enlightenment. Though they may enter samadhi and project their spirit, their essence and spirit remain yin, their dwelling unstable. How can they gather the Three Flowers and return the Five Qi, sever yin and transform their bones, ride the light and mount the simurgh, to become pure yang immortals? Those who clarify emotion and still their nature become but ethereal ghost-immortals.

I hold that among the Nine Elixirs, the Golden Liquid is supreme. Through the ninefold transmutation, the number of pure yang is fulfilled. Thus, the yang spirit leaps forth, the hun endures while the po dissolves, and one’s transformation becomes one with heaven and earth. As for the crucible’s interaction with the myriad things—fortune and misfortune, waxing and waning, floating and sinking, host and guest—the addition and withdrawal of lead and mercury, the waxing and waning of gui, the yang Dragon and yin Tiger, the ascent and descent of water and fire, and the hundred subtle mechanisms—none lie beyond the copulation of Dragon and Tiger, the nurturing of gui’s growth, the extraction of yang from Kan to supplement the yin of Li, the subduing of the latent Dragon and the receding waves. In a single breath, one seizes the creative power of heaven and earth.

Yet within the twelve double-hours, one must keenly observe the subtle and wondrous, discern the moment to act, and never falter in confusion, lest the timing be misaligned and the celestial tally unmet. Then, winter’s depths would bring scorching heat, and summer’s height would yield thick frost—such is the reversal of creation!

Upon examining Master Shi’s *Chart of the Cultivation of the Supreme Polarity Primordial Unity*, the positioning of heaven, earth, and humanity as the Three Powers, and the essentials of elixir refinement, I found the mysteries brilliantly revealed. As the ancients said: “Having caught the hare and fish, one discards the snare and net.” In creating this chart, I rejoice privately, knowing this body cannot perish. Thus, I recognize that enlightenment has long been destined. I now set forth this preface for the benefit of fellow seekers. Respectfully inscribed by Xiao Daocun of Zhang-Gong.

**The Cultivation of the True and Supreme Polarity Primordial Unity Chart**

To knock upon the Mysterious Pass, one must rely on a master’s hand; without a true teacher, the Great Dao remains obscure. I traveled through Jiangnan and, in Nanjing, encountered the Perfected One of Huayang, Shi Jianwu. Clad in a blue turban, purple slippers, a black sash, and flowing robes, his radiance dazzled the eye, and his presence commanded awe. Yet in conversation, he expounded the celestial mechanisms, unfolding the Great Dao in terms both ancient and unprecedented. He then transmitted *The Cultivation of the Mysterious*, its principles so clear and luminous it could be called the true immortal’s secret treasure. Following his guidance, I dared not conceal it for private use. Thus, I transcribed this text to transmit to gentlemen of the Dao. Do not show it to the unworthy, for it is no ordinary worldly book.

**Chart of the Three Luminaries**

This marks the beginning of the Great Dao, arising naturally and dwelling above the thirty-six heavens. Though formless in origin, it manifests in images: above, the Three Clarities; below, the Five Ultimates. The Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity is the abode of the Primordial Beginning beneath the Jade Capital. Below lies the Perfected Realm of Supreme Clarity, where the Most High Lord of the Dao resides. Further below is the Immortal Realm of Supreme Clarity, where the Old Lord dwells. Beneath this lies the Realm of Supreme Void, within which is the Realm of Supreme Non-Being, and within that, the Realm of Supreme Emptiness. Within the Realm of Supreme Emptiness is the Realm of Supreme Substance, and within that, the primordial chaos of heaven and earth, divided into the colors of dark and yellow.

Should one practice the true Dao, one transcends the Three Clarities in a single bound, escaping the wheel of rebirth.

**Discussion:** The Three Clarities correspond to humanity’s Three Fields; the Five Ultimates, to the Five Phases. Refining the essence-qi of the Five Phases yields the inner elixir; uniting the true qi of the Three Fields forms the yang spirit. When the inner elixir is complete, one endures forever; when the yang spirit manifests, one ascends as an immortal.

**Chart of the Three Powers’ Positioning and Dao’s Division**

The *Scripture of Jade Splendor* states: “The One Qi divides to array the Two Modes; the Two Modes established, the Three Powers are deployed.” That which is light and pure ascends as heaven; that which is heavy and turbid descends as earth. Heaven has nine heavens; earth has nine springs.

From the human center, ascending upward: Wind Heaven, Cloud Heaven, Mist Heaven, Qi Heaven, Rosy Heaven—above these, realms exist in name but not in form, for they are pure yang. Azure Heaven, Bluegreen Heaven, Cinnabar Heaven, Scenic Heaven mark the celestial boundary, with the center as the measure.

Descending downward: Dust Spring, Sand Spring, Mud Spring, Stone Spring—below these, realms exist in name but not in form, for they are pure yin.

**Yellow Spring, Black Spring, Dark Spring, and Nether Spring mark earth’s divisions. Between the boundaries of heaven and earth, within the realm of wind and dust, lies the human world. In the human world, those who accumulate blessings and deeds do not transcend the Nine Springs; those who reincarnate in the mortal realm, upholding the Dao and serving the Perfected, may ascend to the Nine Heavens.**

**Master Xishan observes:** *Inward matters are like this: qi resembles the human heart—above the heart, there is no yin. The Nether Spring resembles the human kidneys—below the kidneys, there is no yang. When heart and kidneys unite, the two qi harmonize without error, and ascent and descent naturally bring peace and longevity, much like the accumulation of blessings. Refining the true qi of heart and kidneys to form the inner elixir grants immortality, just as devotion to the Dao does.*

**Diagram of Heaven and Earth’s Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent**
*The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure and True One* states: *Heaven is like an overturned basin—yang struggles to ascend, and accumulated yang generates yin. The reason yin arises is that yang, from within the earth, secretly bears true yin upward. Earth is like a slab of stone—yin struggles to descend, and accumulated yin generates yang. The reason yang arises is that yin, from within heaven, secretly envelops true yang as it descends. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born. Yin and yang arise in reverse, and thus the Dao of heaven and earth is established in opposition. If one comprehends the principle of yin-yang ascent and descent and awakens to the Dao of heaven and earth’s inverted stance, one may cultivate and refine qi to congeal true essence. Within essence, qi is born—this is my qi; within qi, spirit is born—this is my spirit.*

**Master Liu observes:** *The heart is like heaven, the kidneys like earth; qi is like yang, fluid like yin. If qi does not intermingle, they do not unite. Essence resides in the womb of women, giving birth to mortals; essence resides in the Yellow Court of men, giving birth to spirit. When spirit gathers and qi coalesces, the fetal qi emerges from its shell, and one ascends as an immortal!*

**Diagram of the Moon’s Phases**
*The Hidden Writ of the Supreme Lord* states: *The sun and moon each span eight hundred li in circumference. The sun is the essence of Great Yang, moving by the Qian trigram’s reckoning; the moon is the essence of Great Yin, moving by the Kun trigram’s reckoning. Their rising and setting in the east and west divide day and night; their journey south and north determine cold and heat. The sun is purified by the moon’s po-soul; the moon is brightened by the sun’s hun-soul. Clarity and brightness are the qi of the sun and moon; radiance and splendor are their substance. Yin and yang are the Dao of the sun and moon; the crow and hare are their symbols. Mao and You are their paths; day and night are their measures. Their union is their function. Their movements never err, and thus they remain undiminished for ten thousand ages. If one awakens to the Dao of the sun and moon, one may likewise endure for eons without death. The Qian trigram’s reckoning uses nine as its number; the Kun trigram’s reckoning uses six. One nine and one six sum to fifteen, which accounts for the waxing and waning, new and full moons, not exceeding three hundred and sixty days.*

**The Twelve Perfected of Xishan observe:** *What is external reflects what is internal. Heaven and earth resemble the human heart; the sun resembles one’s true yang—yet yang is not kidney qi. The moon resembles one’s true yin—yet yin is not heart qi. True yang and true yin are one’s true water and fire. When water ascends and fire descends, it is called "already crossed," and one becomes an immortal of the terrestrial realm. When fire precedes and water follows, it is called "fire timing," and upon completion, the elixir is formed and one attains immortality.*

**Diagram of Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Seasons, and Human Correspondences**
*The Xishan Cantong Qi* states: *The principles of heaven, earth, sun, moon, and humans are without discrepancy. Heaven and earth have twenty-four qi; the sun and moon have twenty-four degrees; humans have twenty-four hours. Heaven and earth have eight nodes; the sun and moon have eight phases; humans have the eight trigrams. Heaven and earth have spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the sun and moon have waxing, full, waning, and new phases; humans have zi, wu, mao, and you—none differ in the slightest! Only humans fail to awaken to heaven, earth, sun, and moon. If one awakens to the principle of yin-yang ascent and descent in heaven and earth, one naturally knows where the heart and kidneys unite. If one awakens to the reckoning of the sun and moon’s movements, one naturally knows when the liver and lungs transmit and convey. Using heart qi as fire, following the sun’s degrees and adding or reducing without error; using kidney qi as essence, following the moon’s rising and setting, drawing and supplementing without loss—heaven, earth, sun, and moon endure without cause, and by emulating them, one too shall not die.*

**Diagram of the Loss of Qi Through Neglect of Cultivation**
*The Scripture of Purity* states: *The Great Dao is formless, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth; the Great Dao is passionless, yet it moves the sun and moon; the Great Dao is nameless, yet it nurtures the myriad things. Among all things, the most numinous and noble is humanity. Humans are also born of the Dao—how can they not emulate the longevity of heaven and earth or the steadfastness of the sun and moon? Yet the seven emotions disrupt within, and the six desires entice without. Above, the towering pavilion exhales ceaselessly; below, the golden turtle leaks continuously. When qi is born, one does not know to nurture it; when qi flourishes, one does not know to gather it; when qi scatters, one does not know to collect it; when qi weakens, one does not know to supplement it. Thus, qi becomes disordered and illness arises; qi declines and old age comes; qi is exhausted and death follows.*

**It is said:** *If qi is harmonized and not disordered, there is fetal breathing; if qi is firm and not weakened, there is qi refinement; if qi is true and spirit is formed, there is spirit refinement. Before desires are severed, there are arts of the youthful maiden; when weary of practice, there are methods of the outer elixir.*

**Diagram of the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands**
*The Record of Blessed Lands* states: *Blessed lands are not in the mountains but within the human world. The twelve highest-grade blessed lands bestow wealth, honor, beauty, and longevity, and descendants flourish therein.*

**The Lower Thirty-Six Blessed Lands** bring poverty, low status, premature death, ugliness, punishment, and illness. **The Middle Twenty-Four Blessed Lands** are inconstant in fortune and misfortune, unstable in wealth and poverty—some die young yet have descendants, some are ugly yet suffer many ailments. Status rises and falls, gains and losses cycle endlessly. If one accumulates virtuous deeds, one may ascend; if one commits transgressions, one must descend. Those who uphold the Great Dao transcend the wheel of rebirth. If an immortal path exists for ascension, yet one fails to cultivate, one will repeatedly fall, reborn into other realms, forever trapped in the sea of suffering.

**It is said:** The highest-grade blessed lands are humanity’s upper fields, akin to refining spirit and shedding the mortal husk. The middle-grade blessed lands are humanity’s middle fields, akin to refining qi to reverse aging. The lowest-grade blessed lands are humanity’s lower fields, akin to refining essence to abide in the world. Outward appearances reflect inner truths—one mistakes the false for the real.

**Diagram of the Three Islands and Ten Continents in the Sea**
*The Record of the Ten Continents* states: Beyond the dusty world lie the Four Seas; within the Four Seas stand Three Mountains; within the Three Mountains lie the Ten Continents. The **upper islands** are Fangzhang, Penglai, and Yingzhou; the **middle islands** are Furong, Guiyuan, and Yaochi; the **lower islands** are Chicheng, Xuanguan, and Taoyuan. Among them lies a single continent called **Zifu**. Zifu is the abode of the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, where immortals’ merits and practices are recorded. If one refines qi into spirit, sheds the mortal husk, and ascends as an immortal, one first meets the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity to verify one’s origins, examine one’s merits, and confirm one’s practices. One first resides on the lower islands, then gradually ascends.

**It is said:** The dusty world is like the human abdomen—karmic retribution and consequences, like the five phases of human creation, yield only peace and longevity. The Three Islands are like the three barriers behind the elbow—shedding the husk and ascending as an immortal transcends the effects of the five phases. One must first refine golden essence to replenish the ninefold elixir, filling the marrow and strengthening the bones, enabling ascent. Moreover, as divine water descends, golden light gradually emerges, and soon one sheds the husk to become an immortal!

**Diagram of the Void Cavern-Heavens**
*The Record of the Cavern-Heavens* states: If one upholds the Great Dao, refines essence into the elixir, and attains longevity; refines qi into spirit, and the husk ascends as an immortal—one first resides on the Three Islands. If weary of dwelling there, one may return to the dusty world to transmit the Dao and deliver others. When merits are fulfilled and practices perfected, one receives the Purple Edict and the Cinnabar Script, ascending from the Three Islands into the Cavern-Heavens. The Cavern-Heavens exist within the Void, the abode of celestial immortals. If weary of dwelling in the Cavern-Heavens, one may serve as an immortal official: **upper** as Heavenly Officials, **middle** as Earthly Officials, and **lower** as Water Officials. Those who render great service to Heaven and Earth, whose deeds span past and present, become True Lords and ascend to the Yang Heaven, never to return to the mortal world.

**It is said:** The dusty world’s blessed lands are like the human operation of the five phases, confined within the heart and kidneys. The Three Islands beyond the sea are like the three qi behind the elbow, not departing from the three barriers. The Void Cavern-Heavens are like refining spirit to enter the crown, gradually nearing the time of immortal ascension. Thus, to master the five phases, one begins with the three fields; to witness the fruition of transcendence, one relies on the three barriers.

**Diagram of the Paths of Life and Death, Right and Wrong**
One cannot but seek fame and profit, yet seeking them has its destined limits—those who see through this are free from entanglement. One cannot but fulfill love and affection, yet fulfilling them has its destined conditions—those who see through this are free from attachment. Worldly people, failing to awaken, amass gold and jade, believing they will endure for ten thousand kalpas; they dote on children and grandchildren, hoping to live together forever. Yet they do not realize: when gold and jade fill the hall, what can withstand illness when it comes? When children and grandchildren fill one’s eyes, who can take one’s place when qi is cut off? Unceasing sorrow gives rise to illness; unchecked illness leads to aging; unended aging brings death. If one turns the heart to uphold the Dao, one must first cultivate qi—when qi is robust, the body naturally becomes firm. Next, one must refine spirit—when spirit is clear, life naturally attains longevity. Then, one forms the inner elixir, and pure yang qi arises; one refines true qi, and the primordial spirit manifests. Thus, one transcends the ordinary and enters sagehood, escaping the wheel of rebirth.

**Diagram of Immortal and Mortal Paths for the Faithful**
**It is said:** Learning the Dao is not difficult, but finding a true teacher is; finding a teacher is not difficult, but recognizing the method is. Worldly people, failing to grasp this principle, follow trends in seeking teachers, unable to discern truth from falsehood. Some take as teachers those with ancient, Daoist appearances; some, those with eloquent speech; some, those with false reputations and illusory forms; some, those who are wild and deluded. Their entire lives yield nothing, and they sigh at their meager fortune. If such a one transmits a method, pointing to the liver as the dragon and the lungs as the tiger—how can they unite? Mistaking *li* for mercury and *kan* for lead—how can they be drawn and replenished? Swallowing saliva as medicine—how can it transform? Gathering qi as the elixir—how can it remain? Lofty discourse, all empty and void—mere ear-and-mouth learning, of what use is it? Years and months pass in error, days and hours in chaos. Unaware of the beginning and end of the Three Powers, how can one know the roots of the five phases? Thus, one reenters the wheel of rebirth, dismissing immortals as empty words and immortality as falsehood. Yet this is humanity’s own regret, not the fault of former teachers for failing to teach earnestly.

**Diagram of the Three Fields and Five Phases in the Correct Dao**
*The Scripture of the Subtle Cavern* states: When the primordial qi divides, the upper, middle, and lower form the Three Powers; when the Two Modes separate, east, west, south, north, and center arrange the five positions. The five positions transmit and convey the one qi; the Three Powers intersect and unite the one Dao. From ancient times to the present, this cycle has never erred, and the Great Dao remains without birth or extinction.

**Xishan’s Discussion** states: In internal practices, when the fetus is complete and qi is sufficient, after three hundred days of separation from the mother, the four vessels and hundred channels—once the external form is fully developed—divide into the upper, middle, and lower fields, akin to the Three Powers.

**The Five Viscera and Their Correspondences**
The kidneys pertain to Water, the liver to Wood, the heart to Fire, the lungs to Metal, and the spleen to Earth. When the qi of the Five Viscera converges, it forms the elixir; once the elixir is achieved, one may attain longevity and immortality. The lower field stores essence, the middle field holds qi, and the upper field houses spirit—the convergence of these Three Treasures completes the Dao. With the Dao accomplished, one may ascend to sagehood and transcend the mundane.

The Most High has taught: Within the mysterious lies further mystery—within my life-force resides essence, within my qi resides qi, and within my spirit resides spirit. Such is the natural Dao. Thus, the verification of the Dao through the Five Phases and Three Fields cannot be achieved without grasping these subtleties; otherwise, one’s efforts are but vain exertion of spirit and mind.

**Diagram of the Five Phases’ Correspondences**
*The Upper Clarity’s Discourse on Symbols* states: Within the human body, myriad symbols reside! In terms of the Nine Provinces, the kidneys are Jizhou, the bladder Xuzhou, the liver Qingzhou, the gallbladder Yanzhou, the heart Yangzhou, the small intestine Yuzhou, the lungs Liangzhou, and the large intestine Yongzhou. In terms of the Eight Trigrams, the kidneys correspond to Kan ☵, the bladder to Gen ☶, the liver to Zhen ☳, the gallbladder to Xun ☴, the heart to Li ☲, the small intestine to Kun ☷, the lungs to Dui ☱, and the large intestine to Qian ☰. These are but symbolic designations, too numerous to record.

Yet within the profound lies further profundity: the qi of the kidneys becomes the Infant, the fluid of the heart the Maiden, the residual fluid of the spleen the Yellow Dame, and the surplus qi of the lungs the Metal Elder. Even these are but mysteries! Moreover, within the qi of the kidneys, the True One’s Water is concealed, called the Yin Tiger; above the fluid of the heart, the True Yang’s qi is borne, called the Yang Dragon. When Dragon and Tiger unite, it is called the Inner Elixir. When the numinous water descends from the crown, it is called Spirit Water; when the true qi of the elixir ascends, it is called True Fire.

**Diagram of the Inverted True Five Phases**
*The Dragon-Tiger Scripture of the Central Elixir* states: The kidneys are Water, yet Fire is born within Water; the heart is Fire, yet Water is born within Fire; the liver is Wood, yet it flourishes in the West; the lungs are Metal, yet they are born in the East. Such is the principle of the Five Phases’ inversion. If one comprehends this principle, one may nourish without disorder, replenish without depletion, and thereby attain the efficacy of prolonged life.

The kidneys are Water, and Fire is born within Water; within this Fire lies the True One’s Water, manifesting as the abstruse and obscure Yin Tiger. The heart is Fire, and Water is born within Fire; within this Water lies the True Yang’s qi, manifesting as the ethereal and indistinct Yang Dragon. If one comprehends this principle, one may attain longevity and immortality. By inverting the lower field to the upper field and the upper field to the middle field, not only are the Five Phases inverted, but the Three Fields are also reversed. With the Three Fields reversed, one may shed the mortal husk and ascend as an immortal.

Thus, the ancestral master’s formula states:
*If the Five Phases are not inverted, Dragon and Tiger do not unite;*
*If the Three Fields are not reversed, the fetal immortal’s qi remains insufficient.*

**Diagram of the True Five Phases’ Convergence and Transmission**
*The Celestial Origin’s True Calendar* states: The Five Emperors transmit the one qi, and the Dao of Heaven and Earth does not err; the Five Viscera transmit the one qi, and the Dao of humanity does not err. Thus, the true qi of humans follows the great cycles of Heaven and Earth. In spring, it resides in the liver; in summer, in the heart; in autumn, in the lungs; and in winter, in the kidneys.

The primordial qi of humans arises in the kidneys at the *zi* hour; at the end of *chou* and beginning of *yin*, the qi of the kidneys, together with the qi of the bladder, is transmitted to the liver. At the *mao* hour, the qi of the liver arises; at the end of *chen* and beginning of *si*, the qi of the liver, together with the qi of the gallbladder, is transmitted to the heart. At the *wu* hour, the fluid of the heart arises; at the end of *wei* and beginning of *shen*, the fluid of the heart, together with the fluid of the small intestine, is transmitted to the lungs. At the *you* hour, the fluid of the lungs arises; at the end of *xu* and beginning of *hai*, the fluid of the lungs, together with the fluid of the large intestine, is transmitted to the kidneys. Thus, fluid generates qi, circulating endlessly in an unceasing cycle.

Those skilled in cultivation converge the qi of the Five Phases to form the Returned Elixir; they gather the qi of Yin and Yang to form the Inner Elixir. Once the elixir is achieved, longevity is assured and qi is sufficient—shedding the husk, one ascends as an immortal!
