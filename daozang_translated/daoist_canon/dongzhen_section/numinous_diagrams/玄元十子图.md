**Preface to the Chart of the Ten Mysterious Worthies**

The *Chart of the Ten Mysterious Worthies* is rendered in brushwork of lofty antiquity. Daoist Lu Daotong of Changchun Lodge, residing in Qiantang, gathered patrons to carve it in green stone. Upon its completion, a traced copy was brought to me, and I bow in reverence to compose this eulogy.

Draped in plain silk, radiant as spring, the figures seem to gaze back at us—ten worthies made manifest. The sages of old, whether in the gardens of Zheng or the parks of Liao, though distant in years and generations, stand before our eyes as if present. Moon and stars shine clearly, adorning the heavens above. Only through such wondrous works do we grasp the profundity of the Mysterious.

Master Zhao’s spirit roamed as his brush gave them form, leaving even Zhang Sengyou in wistful awe. In an empty hall, a pristine desk, an ancient tripod wafting faint smoke—though their faces are but a foot away, one can almost hear their voices.

In the first winter month of the *yisi* year of the *Dade* era, Zhang Yucai, the Hereditary Celestial Master, inscribed this.

Lu Yunxi of Zhao presented Jiangxi’s Yao Yun with a carved copy of the *Ten Worthies*, transcribed by the eminent scholar Zi’ang, saying: *"I beg you to compose a verse for it."*

Alas! The immortals and all that cannot be transmitted have long since passed—yet this alone remains. For ages, the people have yearned for good governance; might the ancients return once more? Thus, we assemble these images to summon them.

The perfected of old possessed dragon-like virtue, hidden in the heavens, their thunder-chariots submerged in the abyss. None could fathom their turning of the cosmos, as spring traverses ten thousand flowers, yet who could grasp its shadow? Here, ten worthies appear, their fragrance lingering on silk, one stream reflecting a thousand moons, a thousand windows framing two eaves. Solemn and serene, each word carries deeper meaning. Riding the wind, suspended in the celestial vault—why do their forms take such shape?

The compilers of this immortal gathering, steeped in thought within vermilion courts, wielded brushes of transformative power, severing the bounds of Penglai’s gardens. The immortals and sages, moved by their art, brought the ten worthies into view. Their spirits roamed, their conduct pure, as the Five Peaks traced the void. In a trance, in obscurity—they seemed to step from the very frame.

Master Lu stood in solemn awe, as if handling coral or pearl. Gold was amassed to hire artisans, carving jade-like leaves of paper, that men of a thousand generations might behold this gallery. The great Dao in motion, the heroes of the Three and Five, our martial might and tenfold rectification—here, one hears without sound, perceives without form, finds models to emulate. In the solemn vastness of the Great Darkness, though virtue differs, humanity grows ever more constrained.

The sagely and wise tread slowly, sometimes erasing their traces, their transformations vast and wondrous, soaring without cease. Heaven pities the people’s hardships, and thus, in a dream, Mengfu is born.

The grand response aligns with the seeking of images, bringing refinement to governance and clarity. Inscribed on the Shangyuan Festival of the year Wushen in the Dade era.

The Ten Masters of the Mysterious Origin are like the Ten Worthies of the Sagely Confucius. While the Ten Worthies are venerated in ancestral rites, the Ten Masters of our tradition have seldom been thoroughly explored. Since the establishment of the Bureau for Cultivating Literature and Assisting the Dao, few have pursued this study, leaving the teachings of the Ten Masters obscured and concealed, stagnant and obstructed. Now, as the true wind spreads afar and the mysterious customs return to purity, the lineages of Confucius and Laozi stand as one household, sharing the same reverence for the Dao and virtue. Scholars of the Assembly of Worthies have depicted them in paintings, and the Perfected Master of the Teaching has extolled them—these two marvels proceed in tandem, and the learning of the Ten Masters shines forth with radiance. Thus, Nan Gu Xi has not betrayed his lifelong aspiration.

Alas! In the sacred mountains and grotto-palaces, the pearl halls and jade temples, there is no place without them. How could one find scholars who penetrate the mysteries and fathom the subtleties to lecture and recite daily among them, so that all disciples might have models to emulate and return to the Dao and virtue? This would truly be a flourishing affair for the Teaching. I, in my foolishness, hope to witness it—not merely to gaze upon words and images.

The Quanzhen disciple Lu Yunxi once requested inscriptions for *The Celebratory Gathering of the Mysterious Wind* and *The Transmission of the Seven Perfected*. Now, he makes another request, and I rejoice in his earnest devotion to defending the Dao, so I reluctantly inscribe these words.

On the day of Lichun in the year Bingwu of the Dade era, the disciple of the Orthodox Unity, Huang Zhonggui of Sanmao Hall, bows in reverence.

In the Pingchao campaign years ago, Master Shi followed the Perfected Master of the Teaching. Later, he met Teacher Nan Gu, who drew forth from his sleeve the *Chart of the Ten Masters of the Mysterious Origin* and presented it to the Perfected Master. Not wishing to deprive him of his cherished possession, the Master inscribed the end of the scroll and returned it. Several years later, Lu Mingzhen of Changchun and others carved woodblocks for printing, and thus scholars from all directions subtly obtained copies. Lu spoke to me of the inquiry into their forms and images.

The Perfected Sun Dafang of Bianliang recently traveled to Qiantang, intending to carve a copy but had not yet done so. This printing block will now be returned to the Taiqing Temple in Bozhou, to endure for eternity.

Nan Gu’s relationship with Zongyang was such that he designed grand and magnificent structures, establishing the Hall of the Ten Masters of the Mysterious Origin, which truly complements this chart inside and out. How magnificent—is this not the flourishing of the Dao?

Inscribed on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, Jiazi, in the year Dingwei of the Dade era, by the recluse Daoist Huang Shiweng, bowing in reverence.

**Guanyinzi**
Guanyinzi, also known as Yin Xi, was a grandee of the Zhou dynasty.

When Laozi journeyed westward, Yin Xi saw a purple qi floating above the pass and knew a true person would soon arrive. He awaited the signs and beheld Laozi, who indeed appeared. Laozi, recognizing his extraordinary nature, composed a book for him. After receiving Laozi’s work, Yin Xi himself wrote nine chapters, titled *The Master of Guanyin*. Today, the Taihu Guan in Lingbao County, Shaanzhou, stands on the site of the ancient Hangu Pass, where Yin Xi awaited Laozi. The Zongsheng Gong on Mount Zhongnan marks Yin Xi’s former residence. King Mu of Zhou later restored its thatched pavilion, renaming it Louguan and establishing a shrine to Laozi. The rise of Daoist temples truly began here.

After bestowing his scripture, Laozi departed westward through the Dasan Pass and later met again at the Green Ram Market in Chengdu, where he was granted the title Master of the Literary Beginning—the "vast and true person" of whom Zhuangzi spoke.

**Wenzi**
Wenzi, surnamed Xin, named Pi, also called Jiran, was a native of Pu in Kuiqiu. He studied under Laozi. King Ping of Chu once asked him, "I have heard you received the Dao from Lao Dan. May I hear of it?" Wenzi replied, "Virtue corrects the crooked to make it straight, lifts the fallen to restore order, and revives pure virtue, bringing peace to the world—all hinging on one man. Thus, accumulating virtue makes a king, while accumulating wrath leads to ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this, while Jie and Zhou perished by it." The king said, "I respectfully receive your instruction."

Later, Wenzi traveled south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan Li admonished, "I have heard from my master that weapons are instruments of misfortune, and war is contrary to virtue. Conflict is the last resort. Plotting in secret and delighting in lethal tools—testing oneself in such extremes is unwise." Goujian ignored him and was defeated at Fujiao. Later, Wenzi declined a position above the rank of grandee and concealed himself in the Yu Mountains of Wu and Yue. Legend holds he ascended by riding the clouds.

According to the *Universal Geography* and *Annals of Wuxing*, thirty li southeast of Yuying lies Jichou Mountain, named for the terrain surveyed by Yue. Today, the Tongxuan Guan on Baishi Peak in Shanyang marks his former retreat. The Shengyuan Guan at Ziyun Pass was once the Changqing Guan, renamed during the Qiandao era of the Song. On the mountainside, an inscription reads: "The Ascending Cloud Stone stands here."

Wenzi composed twelve chapters, titled *Wenzi*. The Tang dynasty honored him as the Perfected of Universal Mystery, and his work became the *True Scripture of Universal Mystery*.

**Gengsangzi**
Among Laozi’s disciples was Gengsang Chu, a man of Chen. He fully grasped Laozi’s Dao and dwelled on Mount Weilei. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed, and his concubines who were ostentatiously kind distanced themselves. Only the crude and the toiling remained, serving him. After three years, Weilei prospered greatly.

Later, he traveled to Wu and concealed himself on Meng Peak in Piling, where he attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal. Later, the Han dynasty’s Celestial Master Zhang Daoling and the Tang dynasty’s Zhang Guolao successively cultivated there, giving rise to the name Zhanggong Tan, a blessed land. The ancient Dongling Guan was later renamed Tianshen Wanshou Gong during the Song.

He wrote nine chapters, titled *Gengsangzi*, also known as *Kangcangzi*. The Tang dynasty honored him as the Perfected of Cavern Mystery, and his work became the *True Scripture of Cavern Mystery*.

**Nanrongzi**
Nanrong Qu sought an audience with Laozi. Laozi asked, "Why have you come with such a crowd?" Qu glanced behind him in alarm. Laozi said, "Do you not understand what I mean?" Qu bowed and sighed, "Now I have forgotten my answer and thus lost my question."

Laozi asked, "What do you mean?"
Qu replied, "If I do not know, people call me foolish. If I know, I am distressed. If I am unkind, I harm others; if I am kind, I am distressed. If I am unjust, I injure others; if I am just, I am distressed. How can I escape this?"

Laozi said, "Can you embrace the One without losing it? Can you abandon others and seek within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be compassionate? Can you be like a child? A child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes, its body like a withered branch, its heart like dead ashes. In this state, neither fortune nor misfortune arrives. Without fortune or misfortune, how can there be human calamity?"

Initially, Qu studied under Gengsangzi. Gengsangzi said, "My talent is too meager to transform you. Why not go south to see Laozi?" Thus, Qu sought Laozi, saying, "I wish to ask through Chu."

**Yinwenzi**
Yin Wen studied Laozi’s Dao and wore a cap from Mount Hua as his emblem. His way was unburdened by worldly customs and unadorned by material things. He desired the world’s peace, the preservation of people’s lives, and that all—self and others—have enough and no more. He saw insult without shame, sought to end wars and halt conflicts, and thus traveled the world, persuading rulers and teaching the people, never forgetting the world.

His work comprises two chapters, titled *Yinwenzi*.

**Shichengzi**
Shicheng Qi, a recluse of Zhou, traveled a thousand li with weary feet to see Laozi. He said, "I have heard you are a sage. I have come from afar without hesitation to ask about cultivating the self."

Laozi replied, "The Dao is not exhausted in the great nor lacking in the small; its vastness embraces all. Its depth is unfathomable. The utmost person reaches the essence of things, guards their root, and thus transcends heaven and earth, forgets the myriad things, yet their spirit is never wearied."

Shicheng Qi gained insight from this.

**Cuijuzi**

**Cuijuzi**
Cuiju, a worthy minister of Zhou, asked Laozi, "Without governing the world, how can one secure the hearts of the people?"

Laozi replied, "Beware of tampering with the human heart. The human heart pushes downward yet strives upward; it is imprisoned and slain between these forces. Its heat burns like fire, its cold congeals like ice, and its swiftness rivals the flick of a glance. Though it may traverse beyond the four seas in an instant, its abode is deep and still, while its movements soar to the heavens. Fierce and unruly, it cannot be tethered—such is the human heart.

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to tamper with the human heart. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Joy and anger bred mutual suspicion; the foolish and the wise deceived one another; the virtuous did not reproach the wicked, and truth and falsehood mocked each other. Thus, the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and the nature of life dissolved into chaos. The world prized cunning, and the people exhausted themselves in pursuit. Then came the saws to carve, the inked lines to sever, the mallets and chisels to shape—yet the world grew ever more fractured. The fault lies in tampering with the human heart."

Laozi, grieving over the decline of virtue, used Cuiju’s question to warn the world.

**Bojuzi**
Boju, a minister of Zhou, studied under Laozi. Traveling in Qi, he saw an executed criminal. Removing his court robes to cover the body, he wailed to heaven, "You! You! The world suffers great calamity, and you alone have met it first. It is said: 'Do not steal, do not kill.' Yet once honor and disgrace are established, suffering becomes visible. Once wealth and property accumulate, strife appears. When the people are driven to exhaustion without respite, how can they avoid such a fate?

In ancient times, those who ruled the world took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and wrongdoing as their own. Thus

The *Illustrations of the Ten Disciples of the Mysterious Origin* concludes. The character "有" was originally written as "为"; it has been emended according to the *Record of the Mysterious Lineage*.
