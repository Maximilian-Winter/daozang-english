**Preface**
The Dao is fundamentally wordless; words are provisionally established to clarify the Way.
The divine is inherently imageless; images are provisionally employed to seek truth.
Within, it harmonizes yin’s corporeal soul; without, it refines yang’s ethereal spirit,
Accordant with the principle of being and non-being, responsive to the mechanism of movement and stillness.
One ascent, one descent—transforming the wondrous origin of the Three Palaces;
One floating, one sinking—guiding the soaring mystery of the Six Caverns’ flying qi.
Non-action as action perfects the nature of the One True;
Non-doing as doing tempers the elixir of the Nine Yang.
When the elixir attains the pearl’s coagulation, essence flows as celestial water;
Meeting the sun, it ascends in rosy clouds, transcending the myriad forms at their very inception.

**Eulogy:**
Before awakening, one must rely on the myriad methods;
Once the heart opens, not a single thing remains.
Within, the Mystery Pearl manifests—
Silent, companionless, vast as the Void.

**The Great Mystery’s Chaos Diagram**
Now, chaos is the void’s expanse, the dark abyss without light;
Mysterious essence unmanifest, heaven and earth undivided.
The body is pure, profound, and nonexistent—
Not knowing the *how* yet thus it is.

**Eulogy:**
Profoundly still, without sound or hue,
Silent, boundless, obscure, and dark.
Before the forms of heaven and earth emerged,
The essence of the Great One lay deeply concealed.

**Chart of Principles:**
*Qingleng* (Pure Cold)          *Wuwei* (Non-Action)
*Daode* (Virtue/Power)         *Ziran* (Spontaneity)

**The Unseen Diagram**
Now, the unseen arises from the cultivator of truth who has not opened the eye of the Dao. Though facing the brightness of sun and moon, one cannot know one’s own nature. Day and night pass in movement, yet the myriad existences remain obscure. Thus, the clarity of things depends on the essence of the *mao*-blurred.

**Eulogy:**
Unseen, the eye bears flaws and disease;
Once the heart opens, the Dao’s vision is cleansed.
Awakened, the Dipper appears at noon;
Deluded, the Mystery Pearl is lost in waves.

**The Great Mystery’s Spirit-Restraining Diagram**
Within, no form is visible—luminous, void, and still. The image resembles dark frost, for it is the root of life’s fixed stem.

**Eulogy:**
Gentle, weak, and utterly empty—supreme virtue,
Humble, hidden, and selfless.
Closing the eyes, refining thought, forsaking reflection,
Silent, inwardly guarding true compassion.

**The Great Mystery’s Spirit-Refining Diagram**
The Dao is not seen by ordinary sight but by true vision.
Wondrously, the spirit transforms, radiant in all directions,
Brilliant as the mingled yang-soul,
Roaming before the Emperor of Images.

**Eulogy:**
Eyes bright beneath brows, light resplendent,
Piercing the hollow wall of Mount Jing.
Dazzling, the numinous treasure grows pure,
Pervading the subtle vastness of the Great Void.

**The Great Mystery’s Movement and Stillness Diagram**
The Dao is without intent, profoundly still and unmoving.
Silent and mysterious—this is stillness.
The spirit responds when stirred, connecting through resonance,
Dispersing in wondrous subtlety—this is movement.
One movement, one stillness—thus the true Dao is accomplished.

**Eulogy:**
Shattering Mount Jing to seek jade,
Rending the world’s net to search for the Mystery.
Two points of pure light, luminous and clear,
A single wheel of the red sun fills the sky.

**The Great Mystery’s Being and Non-Being Diagram**
The Great Dao acts without acting yet lacks no action.
Acting, it has being; in essence, it is non-being.
Non-being in function yet possessing being.
Penetrating the mysterious to enter the wondrous,
Revealing the Dao’s numinous power—
This is the principle of being and non-being giving rise to one another.

**Eulogy:**
Jade cassia hidden in the moonlit sea,
Jewel forests gleaming with cold light.
Mysterious illumination, perfectly one,
Embracing the boundless, vast and without limit.

**The Great Mystery’s Ascending and Descending Diagram**
Gazing upward, it grows ever higher—
The spirit ascends, revealing the floating signs of celestial images.
Delving deeper, it grows ever firmer—
The spirit descends, responding to earth’s sinking principles.
Balanced in emptiness and applied,
Rising and falling in harmony,
Communing with the myriad mechanisms,
Effortlessly shifting between above and below.

**Eulogy:**
The spirit transforms, ascending and descending,
The Dao’s mechanism floats and sinks.
Within the mystery, the numinous treasure grows wondrous,
Its light illuminating the heart of heaven.

**The Great Mystery’s Three Essentials Diagram**
The origin of the Great Beginning—
The Dao of emptiness and non-being.
The pervading radiance—
The brightness of the Emperor of Images.
The congealing of fetal light—
The illumination of the primordial spirit.
The three as one, perfectly blended,
Manifesting the principle of true emptiness.

**Eulogy:**
The Golden Elixir is like the red sun,
The supreme Dao resembles the blue sky.
As long as the eye’s light remains undimmed,
Why seek the Mystery outside?

**The Great Mystery’s Six Harmonies Diagram**
The Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity commune—
Emptiness containing emptiness.
The harmonious and the primordial merge—
Qi containing qi.
Wisdom’s light and the Emperor of Images congeal—
Spirit containing spirit.
The six caverns fly in mystery—
This is the Dao of the threefold union.

**Eulogy:**
Sunlight piercing the dark yang, penetrating all,
Wind splitting the summit, heaven opening.
The land fills with dragon-light, advancing in splendor,
The spirit’s work soars on two wings.

**The Great Mystery’s Nine Yangs Diagram**
As in the principles above, all mingle as one.
The transformation of the One True—
Shaping the formless form.
Brilliant, flowing light,
Illuminating the eight directions,
Inner and outer luminous and clear—
This is the truth of the nine yangs’ mysterious image.

**Eulogy:**
Illuminating the true, observing earth and heaven,
Stars flying, awakening to the profound mystery.
Even here, subtle obstructions remain—
How could it compare to the state before all beginning?

**The Nine Yangs of Supreme Mystery: Cultivating True Perfection**

**Song:**
At the dawn of primordial chaos,
Primal harmony transformed the Great Beginning.
Three palaces divide above and below,
Six caverns respond to sinking and floating.
Brahmanic qi circulates boundlessly,
Primordial radiance pervades being and nonbeing.
Heaven and earth serve as the precious crucible,
The cosmos becomes the elixir furnace.
The Emperor of Images holds the numinous essence,
Round and bright, harmonizing the Great Void.
Spirit congeals as the phoenix’s marrow,
Qi crystallizes as the azure toad’s essence.
Refined into true purity,
Pure yin is wholly eradicated.
The nine yangs gather as sacred fire,
Transforming into the Pearl of Chaos Primordial.

**Eulogy:**
Transmitted as a model,
Within it discerns being and nonbeing.
Being and nonbeing shine through to the depths,
The mysterious image transmutes into the elixir pearl.

**The Twelve Hours of Supreme Mystery**

**Midnight (*Zi*)**
At midnight, the Mysterious Origin’s Sage Ancestor imparts his teaching.
Yang’s essence shines with the wind of remote antiquity,
The Celestial Vault delights in the Unfettered Master.
Each claims ability—why exhaust yourself?
Forget the one mechanism, and all lies herein.
Zigao’s feathers descend as divine birds,
Yet why seek the monstrous roc when none appears?

**Second (*Chou*)**
At cock’s crow, in dreams one awakens the luminous primal head.
Yang’s light has yet to emerge, yet the eyes open early,
Heavenly water returns the numinous to the Dipper’s mouth.
Unlock the Mysterious Pass,
Connect the mechanism at the elbow,
Silently release nonbeing—clarity arises from within.
Only then does one grasp the art of escape,
The great sound’s simplicity—how could it roar?

**Third (*Yin*)**
At dawn’s first light, numinous yang has yet to appear, yet things renew.
The perfect bamboo’s brightness is hard to voice,
The ignorant chatter ceaselessly.
Forget the turbid form,
Exchange the defiled body,
The Dao’s companion dwells among immortals, choosing the loftiest neighbor.
Those who cannot distinguish truth from falsehood are madmen,
Stolidly contending in the dust as "I" and "others."

**Fourth (*Mao*)**
At sunrise, the cinnabar phoenix soars without entanglement.
Resplendent, its radiance embraces the vast sky,
Brilliant, it illuminates the minutest twigs.
The immortal’s mechanism,
Suddenly comprehended,
The mysterious and true, subtle and pure—yet not trifling.
The cracks in the vessel release the Central Flower’s principle,
Heaven’s luster, dustless, transmits the Six Treasures.

**Fifth (*Chen*)**
At breakfast hour, the dense celestial light illumines the Valley Spirit.
Abundant and vast, it fuses into oneness,
Entering the year through the subtle breath, discussing the Three Bodies.
The Dao is empty and still,
Nature attains itself.
Chaos primordial congeals, things grow rich and pure.
Do not equate the demonic *taowu* with the jade grove,
Between the maples, the numinous *chun* emerges anew from the old.

**Sixth (*Si*)**
At mid-morning, the Dao naturally abides: from the Three-in-One, the Two arise.
The *zi* bell’s bamboo is dim-witted, lacking deep thought,
Yet it extends and contracts, grasping the Sage’s intent.
Awaken to true emptiness,
Illuminate the teaching’s essence,
One numinous awareness pervades heaven and earth.
Dwelling in vast solitude within the Great Void,
Who can reveal this return to the origin?

**Seventh (*Wu*)**
At noon, the celestial light blazes, dazzling the earth.
The *shu* child dwells deep within the *shu* chamber,
Face serene and pale, forgetting bitterness and sweetness.
Awakening and delusion,
Each finds its place,
Assisting the upright, expelling the perverse—measurement is needed.
The Enlightened Emperor of Images emerges from prior heaven,
Wielding the pure wind of remote antiquity.

**Eighth (*Wei*)**
At afternoon decline, the courtyard is silent, the golden mastiff ceases its bark.
Silently guard the divine work’s supreme mechanism,
The numinous waves surge to the depths, filling heaven and earth.
Abide in the subtle and mysterious,
Truly pure and lovely,
Those who have not awakened must proceed with care.
Unveiling the jade gate, the starry eyes appear,
Yet who can fathom the Dao’s single character as "good"?

**Ninth (*Shen*)**
At evening meal hour, delight in heaven and know fate, free from hardship.
No envy for Qi’s three offices of beauty,
No desire for Lin Lei’s hundred springs.
The Dao as master,
Nature as guest,
The two qi congeal, uniting in utmost truth.
Gazing upward, one borrows the toad’s palace shadow,
Already encountering floating wood emerging from the wave’s ford.

**Tenth (*You*)**
At sunset, solitary and expansive, still and friendless.
Lofty peaks, the moon rises, scattering jade flowers,
By the stream, the wind gently sways golden willows.
The Dao arises of itself,
Spirit and thought guard,
Round and bright, profound and limpid—within nonbeing, being.
Essential yang bursts forth in the Great Void,
Driving back yin demons beyond the heavens.

**Eleventh (*Xu*)**
At dusk, twin painted candles illuminate the empty chamber.
Children play within its radiance,
The red child’s work is complete in this brilliance.
Wield nature’s light,
Spirit’s majestic power,
Form dissolves, the heart congeals—extending and withdrawing.
Truly, the single flavor of supreme yang’s essence,
The wise master’s nourishment—sweet as honey.

**Twelfth (*Hai*)**
At human rest, the screen is lowered, the door closed, forgetting love and hate.
Self-content, serene, beyond the world’s mechanism,
Carefree and unconstrained, nothing hinders stillness.
The Dao flourishes in talismans,
True origin abides,
Heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness reveal fortune and misfortune.
*Zhun* and *Meng* receive the hexagrams, bestowing life and completion,
Myriad sages and thousand perfected all rely upon this.
