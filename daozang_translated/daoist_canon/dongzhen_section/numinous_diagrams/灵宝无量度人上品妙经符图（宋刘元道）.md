**Middle Scroll of the Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity** *(Upper scroll originally missing)*
Compiled by Liu Yuandao, Purple-Robed Daoist of the Taiqing Chuqing Abbey and Guardian of the One

### **The Thirty-Five Divisions: The Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin**
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions comprise the Thirty-Five Divisions. They govern the primordial *qi* of the Upper Heavens, presiding over creation and transformation.

The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. As the *Records of the Celestial Offices* in the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: "The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four quarters. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, harmonizes the Five Phases, shifts the nodal measures, and determines all celestial patterns—all pivot upon the Dipper." This chart is drawn to observe the directional images. I have arranged the constellations to elucidate this chapter.

### **The Thirty-Two Heavens: A Comprehensive Summary of Hidden Mysteries**
From the Great Yellow Emperor’s *Huang* Heaven to the *Shangming* and Seven Luminaries’ *Moye* Six Heavens form the Desire Realm.
From the *Xuwu* and *Yueheng* Heavens to the *Wuji* and *Tanshi* Eighteen Heavens form the Form Realm.
From the *Haoting* and *Xiaodu* Heavens to the *Taisu*, *Xiule*, *Jin*, and *Shang* Four Heavens form the Formless Realm.
These are called the Three Realms.

From the *Taixu Wushang Changrong* Heaven to the *Taiji Pingyu Jiayi* Four Heavens are the Heavens of the Seed People.

Upon examining this scripture, I have divided it into ten matters:
1. **Heavenly Names** – The names fixed at the beginning of the kalpa.
2. **Imperial Titles** – The titles bestowed by the Primordial Beginning.
3. **Imperial Taboo Names** – The names of the Heavenly Emperors.
4. **Heavenly Emperor’s Governance** – The office of the Eternal Dao.
5. **Constellation Qi** – The *qi* descending in connection with the Twenty-Eight Constellations.
6. **Qi Names** – The names of the primordial *qi* as received.
7. **Qi Colors** – The colors of the primordial *qi* as divided by direction.
8. **Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech** – Established internally, composed by the Dao Lord. The details are expounded in the chapter on the origin of internal sounds in the lower scroll.
9. **Divisional Boundaries** – The ascent and descent between upper and lower.
10. **Lifespans of Heavenly People** – The measures of longevity and brevity.

This chart is the essence of the precious scripture; those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, Xue Youqi’s notes, and Yan Dong’s commentary.

### **Chart of the Primordial Harmony: The Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Chapters**
The chapter is established by the *Scripture of Jade Characters of Internal Sounds*.

**Heavenly Names | Imperial Titles | Imperial Taboo Names | Heavenly Emperor’s Governance | Constellation Qi | Qi Names | Qi Colors | Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech | Divisional Boundaries | Lifespans of Heavenly People**

### **Explanation of Constellation Qi**
The twenty-eight heavens of the cardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* of one constellation. The four heavens of the intercardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* between two constellations. Furthermore, the descending and intersecting *qi* cause the heaven of the northeast to also connect with the constellation of the northwest—this is the ascending *qi* of generation, spiraling upward like a ram’s horns. Though the profound principles are thoroughly understood, confusion may arise regarding the directions and intercardinal points; thus, this chart is made to clarify them.

### **Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors and Their Governance**
As recorded in the scriptural meaning, the Five Heavens—each embodying the *qi* of the Five Spirits—reside in the midst of the Great Void. Above, the Five Dippers are arrayed; below, the Five Peaks stand. The Five Emperors govern them. These are the directional heavens of colors, not the heavens of formed images.

The names, taboo names, and governance of the Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dippers, Five Heavenly Demon Kings, and Five Great Demon Kings should be known by those who recite the scriptures. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, the *Charts from the Essential Governance of the Shangshu*, and the *Scripture of the Five Chapters of True Writ* to establish this chapter.

All were composed by the Dao Lord.
The details are recorded in the lower scroll’s *Chapter on the Manifest Treasure Scripture’s Sealed Treasury Descending into the World* and the *Chapter on the Causes of the Inner Sounds’ Manifestation*.
Here, the beginning and end are separated, the sections divided, and the character count fixed according to the canon.

**Formulas for Reciting the Two Principal Scripture Chapters**
On days designated for scripture recitation, within a purified chamber, arrange an eastern-facing scripture table and seating. Enter the chamber, turn your back to the mat, and face east to perform the three bows.
After bowing, retreat and sit facing north.
Once the *qi* settles, gradually turn left to face east and sit upright.
Recite the incantation:
Silent, reaching the ultimate origin,
Vastly towering through kalpas’ blades.
The *Huoluo* reveals the cavernous mystery’s scripture—
Who can fathom this profound distance?
Entering the Great Vehicle’s path,
Who reckons the kalpas’ multitude?
Unborn, undying,
To be born arises from the lotus.
Transcending the Three Realms’ paths,
A compassionate heart unravels the world’s snares.
The Perfected One’s supreme virtue
Makes one a celestial household for generations.

After the incantation, rest your hands on your knees and strike your teeth thirty-two times.
Close your eyes and visualize the thirty-two heavens, each with its Emperor Lord.
Contemplate one heaven’s name and bow in your heart to its Emperor.
Begin with the Heaven of Imperial Might, rotating with the sun, circling the four directions, gradually ascending to the Heaven of *Jiayi*.
In total, thirty-two bows—though the body remains still, the heart prostrates.
After bowing, visualize yourself amid clouds of blue, yellow, and white *qi*, soon filling the chamber with dense, misty radiance.
To your left, the Azure Dragon; to your right, the White Tiger; before you, the Vermilion Bird; behind you, the Dark Warrior.
Sixteen lions sit in two rows before you, facing one another;
An equal number of white cranes stand beyond the lions.
The sun before you, the moon behind, illuminating the chamber.
A nine-colored halo emerges from your crown, shining through all heavens.
Surveying your visualization, all appears vividly before your eyes.
Silently recite the incantation:

The Most High Mysterious Prime Supreme Lord of the Dao,
summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the Left and Right Attendants and Envoys,
the Jade Lads who tend the incense,
the Jade Maidens who transmit words,
the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors,
and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each,
to open and relay all that is spoken.
What is spoken refers to matters of Heaven and Earth,
sun and moon, stars and constellations,
the sovereign, teachers and friends,
ancestors, oneself, and the multitudes of the people—all that is prayed for.
When the incantation reaches the word “relay,” name these matters.
Today is an auspicious and joyous day,
a day of long fasting and pure halls,
of cultivating the scriptures and delivering boundless beings.
This servant, together with [name], or [name]—here name the same aspiration as above—
or state: “This servant, together with so-and-so, or for such-and-such matter.”
Having recited the scriptures and received rebirth,
may all that has been relayed ascend directly
to the august presence of the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.
When the incantation is complete,
slowly draw in one breath of *qi* from each of the Thirty-Two Heavens, swallowing it in turn.
Proceed as before.
Cease.

Then open the eyes and recite the two chapters. Upon completing the recitation, face south, descend from the mat, bow again, and withdraw.

Following the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan and the methods of Zhang Wanfu, these chapters are hereby established.

**Quiet Chamber Diagram**
The Great Elixir is thus—within the illuminated chamber, there is no need to face south and open the door.

**Recitation of the Inner Sound Formulae**
Recite the sixty-four characters of the East:
From *"Danlou Ahui"* to *"Sixiang Xuyuan."*
Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.
Silently intone the incantation:
*"Vermilion brightness unfolds the chart,
Eight qi return to the true.
Governing the Mysterious Gate,
Great Azure Emperor Divine.
Flowing transformation beyond the nine,
Entwining my form.
Sacred sounds of eight writings,
Sixty-four scrolls.
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Uniting with me as immortal.
Conveying the dragon chariot,
Ascending to the imperial axle."*
Conclude, draw in *qi* nine times, swallowing it, and recite.

Recite the sixty-four characters of the South:
From *"Nanyan Dongfu"* to *"Shenying Zigong."*
Sit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize a vermilion phoenix soaring before you, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body.
Silently intone the incantation:
*"Three qi linger and circle,
Sacred phoenix comes in flight.
Jade sounds of eight characters,
Resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration,
My Dao unfolds in radiance.
Crimson cinnabar nourishes,
Gaze upward to absorb the divine light.
Body born of water and fire,
Crimson-clad in feathered robes.
Ascend the void with mystic steps,
Feet treading the phoenix ladder.
Circling the eight heavens,
Seven ancestors follow in tow."*
Conclude, draw in *qi* three times, swallowing it, and recite.

Recite the sixty-four characters of the West:
From *"Daoli Huiyou"* to *"Baikong Duxian."*
Sit upright, click the teeth seven times, and visualize white tigers and lions guarding before and behind, with seven layers of pale clouds enveloping the body.
Silently intone the incantation:
*"Seven qi of golden numen,
Eight heavens’ honored divinities.
White tiger steers the chariot,
Lions bear the axle.
Seven qi entwine,
Refining me into immortal.
Body ascends in golden light,
Shining upon the pale clouds.
Inner and outer transformation,
Rising into the cavernous gate.
Seven ancestors escape the night,
Nine dark realms turn their souls.
Eons of deliverance,
Abiding with the turning of the Dao."*
Conclude, draw in *qi* seven times, swallowing it, and recite.

Recite the sixty-four characters of the North:
From *"Juewu Ziyu"* to *"Youji Duren."*
Sit upright, click the teeth five times, and visualize flying dragons and the Dark Warrior, their feathered canopies lush and dense; divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying skirts. Five layers of black clouds envelop the body.
Silently intone the incantation:
*"Mysterious heavens linger and circle,
Flowing radiance ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Great Possession initiates the turning,
Eight characters of lofty brightness.
Flying darkness stills the void,
Yin of the cavern generates itself.
Five qi entwine,
Irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded in the Northern Loneliness,
Receiving refinement from the cavernous numen.
Kidney palace emerges from the north,
Inner and outer luminous essence.
Soaring through the Three Realms,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors share in fortune,
Rejoicing in kalpas of age.
Within the forest of seven treasures,
Return to the womb and be reborn.
Escape the long night,
Name recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow Register and White Tablet,
Generation upon generation born as immortals."*
Conclude, draw in *qi* five times, swallowing it, and recite.

**Verification of Reciting the Two Chapters of the Orthodox Scripture**
During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past lives’ souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace.
During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain divine transcendence, with names inscribed in the heavens.
Yellow Register and White Tablet erase death and grant rebirth.
During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture for the emperor and sovereign, ruler and ministers, father and son, to stabilize the nation’s destiny and preserve the heavens’ longevity.
Generation upon generation unbroken, ever ruling as sovereigns.
Stabilizing their realm, the people proclaim great peace.

On the days of the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.
On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the soul and spirit, eternally abiding in the myriad *qi*, free from suffering, the body radiant with light.
Attended by the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors, myriad spirits pay homage, and names are inscribed in the heavens above.
With merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, ascend to the Upper Clarity.
Recite ten times, and the heavens record the merit.
Recite a hundred times, and names are delivered to the Southern Palace.
Recite a thousand times, and demon kings guard and welcome.
Recite ten thousand times, and the Dao is complete—ascend to the Great Void.

If one encounters such an occasion and recites according to the formula, above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm to deliver the multitudes; in the middle, it rescues ancestors and grants oneself the Dao.
This may be called the majestic Great Brahma, the unmatched wanderer of the Jade Capital.

**Verification of Reciting the Inner Sounds**
The Great Brahma sound of the East: recite for nine years, and the eight heavens each send eight Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens and Azure-Florescence Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of Azure Teeth. The body generates radiant light, penetrating the void.
After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected—soar to the Upper Clarity, and seven ancestors share in fortune, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

The Great Brahma sound of the South: recite for three years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens and Great Yang Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the three crimson *qi*. White returns to the countenance.
Unshaken for ten thousand kalpas, seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Fortune, returning to the immortal womb to be reborn.

The Great Brahma sound of the West: recite for seven years, and the eight heavens each send eight Pale Numen Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the seven pale *qi*. Years halt, and the visage remains youthful for ten thousand kalpas.
Fortune extends to seven ancestors, ascending to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb to be reborn, generation upon generation as immortals.

The Great Brahma sound of the North: recite for five years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Prime Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the five nourishing *qi*. Years return, and radiance abides—life preserved in the Three Clarities. Fortune extends to the nine lineages, generation upon generation ascending.
If one recites the inner sounds of the four directions according to the formula, there is nothing that cannot be averted, nothing that cannot be warded, nothing that cannot be delivered, nothing that cannot be accomplished.

The Flying Celestials descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, the myriad spirits prostrate in homage, and the Three Realms attend in reverence. Subduing the host of spirits, purifying the ten directions, the Dao perfected and merit accomplished, one serves the Three Clarities as a minister. Humbly, I, Zhang Wanfu, have annotated this fixed chapter to elucidate its meaning.

The *Mingbao Sutra* was sealed and concealed upon its descent into the world.
The Heavenly Worthy, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, expounded this scripture and bestowed it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Brahma sounds were granted. After the Dao Lord compiled its sequence, it was treasured in heaven and concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its sealing is of utmost gravity—transmitted only to the sagely. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for averting the calamity of the *jiashen* year, entrusting it to practitioners of the true Dao, whence it circulated among mortals. This scripture comprises the hidden hymns of the Celestial Emperors and the secret chants of the Numinous Demon Kings, revealing the kalpic fortunes of heaven and earth, the names and titles of the myriad spirits, the conjunction of yin and yang, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully fathomed, nor its principles fully unraveled. Those who attain enlightenment shall naturally achieve profound clarity. In heaven, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas; among mortals, once every forty years. To leak or profane it lightly brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude in the nether darkness. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious! Humbly, I, Li Shaowei, have annotated this chapter to clarify its meaning.

On the Origin of the Inner Sounds
In the Crimson Clarity World, the Heavenly Worthy ascended the Cypress Terrace throne. At that moment, clouds and mist surged thickly for three days and nights, and the gloom of yin did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Such a sight has never been witnessed in our attendance today." When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, mountains and seas fell silent, and heaven and earth grew solemnly still. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the celestial and human realms tremble in fear. We, your ministers, harbor doubts—we know not the reason.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Today, the various heavens manifest auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters blaze resplendently, obscuring the light of life. Let all present close their eyes and await." In an instant, the celestial *qi* suddenly parted, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Each bore a script of numinous writing, its characters a *zhang* in size, manifesting in the void. Their brilliance dazzled, their eight corners trailing beams of light, their splendor too bright to behold.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to the assembled spirits: "This is the *Lingshu of the Eight Meetings*—its characters lack fixed form, its purport profound and subtle. You would find it difficult to trace or fathom." Thereupon, the command was given to the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe its characters and explicate its sounds, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord, totaling two hundred and fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged them into text, calling it the *Hidden Language of the Great Brahma*. It was appended to the two subsequent chapters in sequence.

The Sovereign was one who once descended upon Mount Emei during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, imparting to him the method of the Three Ones and Five Sprouts, before ascending once more to heaven. Humbly, I have collated the *Inner Sounds Sutra* with the *Biographies of the Immortals* to annotate this chapter.
