### **First Matter: The Supreme Sovereign’s Transmission of the Dragon-Horse Diagram**

**On the Diagram:**
In ancient times, when the Sovereign Xuānyuán (玄牺氏) ruled, he was blessed by the auspicious sign of the Dragon-Horse, which bore the numerical patterns of Heaven and Earth from the Yellow River—this is called the *Lóng Tú* (龙图). The arrangement followed the principle of *Dài jiǔ lǚ yī* (戴九履一), with three on the left and seven on the right, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet, and five at the center of the abdomen. Vertically and horizontally, the total always sums to fifteen—this is the *Yì·Xì* (易·系) doctrine of *"cāng wǔ yǐ biàn"* (参伍以变), weaving the numbers in intricate patterns.

The Supreme Sovereign then established the Five Phases (五行) based on these four cardinal directions. The black of *yáng* (阳) began at *Jiǎnzǐ* (建子, the first *gānzhēng* stem-branch), marking the origin of generation, while the black of *yīn* (阴) emerged at *Jiànwǔ* (建午), laying the foundation for austerity and destruction. When these two blacks intermingled, transformation ensued—thus giving rise to all things and destroying all things.

Moreover, *Tiān yī* (天一) originates from *Kǎn* (坎), *Dì èr* (地二) from *Lí* (离), *Tiān sān* (天三) from *Zhèn* (震), *Dì sì* (地四) from *Duì* (兑), and *Tiān wǔ* (天五) from the center—these are the generative numbers of the Five Phases.

Since solitary *yīn* cannot generate and lone *yáng* cannot manifest, *Zǐ* (子) was paired with *Dì liù* (地六), *Wǔ* (午) with *Tiān qī* (天七), *Mǎo* (卯) with *Dì bā* (地八), *Yǒu* (酉) with *Tiān jiǔ* (天九), and the center with *Dì shí* (地十). Having perfected the Five Phases’ complete numbers, the Eight Trigrams were established, layered to form the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines—this is the profound intent of the Sage’s divination and observation of symbols.

Yet Xuānyuán lived tens of thousands of years before King Wén (文王), during the ninth year of King Zhòu (纣). Could the author of the *Yì* have been moved by King Wén’s sufferings?

After King Wén’s death, five hundred years passed before Confucius was born. Confucius then expounded the *Yì*’s Way, saying: *"The Yellow River bore the Diagram, the Luo bore the Scripture—the Sage followed these."* Thus, the Dragon-Horse’s omen could not have been revealed without Xuānyuán’s enlightenment, nor could the River Diagram’s numbers have been fully elucidated without Confucius’ interpretation.

The intricate numerical patterns extend upward to the Two Principles (*Èr Yí*, 二仪), embrace all things within, and encompass the transformations of Heaven and humanity, the mysteries of spirits and gods—all contained therein.

How could anyone dare to contradict this Diagram without reckoning with the Sage’s words?

### **Second Matter: The Double-Layered Sixty-Four Hexagrams and the "Pushing and Rolling" Method**

The Sage observed celestial symbols and drew the Trigrams, adhering to the Dragon Diagram’s intricate numerical order. Gazing upward at Heaven and downward at Earth, drawing near to the body and extending to all things, the six-line Trigram symbols were established, and the *Sān Cái* (三才, Heaven-Earth-Human) principles were thus complete. This method exhausts the four cardinal transformations and fulfills the myriad things’ numbers.

The origin of the Eight Trigrams lies in the Four Symbols (四象), which are the complete numbers of the Five Phases. Water’s number is six; subtracting three lines leaves *Kǎn* (坎), and the remaining three lines are arranged above *Hài* (亥) to form *Qián* (乾). Gold’s number is nine; subtracting three lines leaves *Duì* (兑), and the remaining six lines are arranged above *Wèi* (未) to form *Kūn* (坤). Fire’s number is seven; subtracting three lines leaves *Lí* (离), and the remaining four lines are arranged above *Sì* (巳) to form *Xùn* (巽). Wood’s number is eight; subtracting three lines leaves *Zhèn* (震), and the remaining five lines are arranged above *Yín* (寅) to form *Gèn* (艮)—this is how the Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams.

The Five Phases omit *tǔ* (土) because each governs a season. Yet the Sage, lacking a central symbol, derived meaning beyond the diagram, thus arranging lines to form hexagrams and stacking them to create the lines.

The number of *Qián* (乾) is two hundred sixteen, and that of *Kūn* (坤) is one hundred forty-four, totaling three hundred sixty. When applied to the *Qǐ* (期) method, the two sets of divining stalks amount to one thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the myriad things’ numbers.

Great indeed! The numbers seven and nine of *yáng*, and six and eight of *yīn*, are the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth—none could have contrived them by human intellect. Even Xuānyuán, though endowed with divine wisdom, merely acted as Heaven’s instrument.

### **Third Matter: The Great Correlation’s Number Fifty**

The Great Correlation’s number is fifty, yet its application uses forty-nine. Fifty represents the divine function of the *Cáo* (曹), revealing the numbers of *yīn* and *yáng*, determining the strategies of *Qián* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤), and completing the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines. Forty-nine omits the one of Heaven, symbolizing the *Tàijí* (太极) and the unfathomable divine function.

Fifty-five is the extreme number of Heaven and Earth, the means by which transformation occurs and spirits and gods act.

Yet many ancient scholars have expounded on the Great Correlation’s number. Mǎ Jìzhǎng (马季长) and Zhèng Kāngchéng (郑康成) each held their own interpretations, their meanings clear.

Carefully examining the *Xìcí* (系辞):
*"Heaven’s numbers are five—five is odd. Earth’s numbers are five—five is paired."* The five positions interact harmoniously, each combining to form metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Heaven’s numbers are one, three, five, seven, nine; Earth’s are two, four, six, eight, ten—this is the fifty-fivefold number.

When speaking of "five positions," it refers to the odd and paired positions; "having harmony" means the union of *yīn* and *yáng*. Once *yīn* and *yáng* unite to produce the Five Phases, one must within these five positions—[missing text]—the ruler.

For instance, *Tiān yī* (天一) and *Dì liù* (地六) combine to generate water. The "combining" refers to—[missing text]—while the "generating" refers to *Zǐ* (子). When speaking to one’s parents, the empty one in the numbers signifies water, using—[missing text]—as its function, much like the Great Correlation’s omission.

Thus, *Dì èr* (地二) and *Tiān qī* (天七) combine, *Tiān sān* (天三) and *Dì bā* (地八) combine, *Dì sì* (地四) and *Tiān jiǔ* (天九) combine, *Tiān wǔ* (天五) and *Dì shí* (地十) combine—at each juncture of their union, one must omit—[missing text]—to complete the numbers of the Five Phases, including metal and earth.

Thus, the empty one in each position is not an omission. For the five positions—parental forms—conceal the functions of the five children within, and yet they seek to complete transformations, manifesting the movements of spirits and gods.

The Five Phases, capable of aiding and blessing Heaven and Earth, generating all things, are such that *yīn* and *yáng* cannot be fully measured—how much less so for humanity? Therefore, it is said that the functions of the five children are concealed within. If it were otherwise, whence would the numbers of the Five Phases arise?

That which generates all things is the numbers of wood and fire;
That which completes all things is the numbers of metal and water.
Earth has no fixed position, yet its sovereignty over the four seasons is evident.

The Sage says: *"Pure black is the essence of things; wandering spirits are the source of transformation."* This is what is meant.

Moreover, when Heaven and Earth’s paired unions generate the Five Phases, even if one perceives the principle of their union yet fails to grasp the logic of their generation, how could the five children then manifest in sequence? Thus, the five positions omit five to establish the Dao of concealing the functions of the Five Phases, making clear the Great Correlation’s fifty interruptions.

The eight trigrams transform into sixty-four hexagrams—fourth section, forming the *Yì*. Eighteen transformations produce the hexagrams; the eight trigrams are incomplete in themselves. Extending this, the sixty-four hexagrams are formed.

The Dao of the Three Powers, the source of all things, the numbers of *yīn* and *yáng*, the mysteries of spirits and gods—none can escape their patterns.

However, the variations of eight eight (sixty-four) are too extensive to enumerate fully, hence the *Qǐan* is marked as the first, serving as the model for the remaining hexagrams.
*Qǐan* is Heaven; *Kǔn* (天风*垢*), *Zhú* (天山*逐*), *Pǐ* (天地*否*), *Guān* (风地*观*), *Bō* (山地*剥*), *Jìn* (火地*晋*), *Dàyǒu* (火天*大有*)—these seven hexagrams derive from *Qǐan*.

The *Yì* says: *"Wandering spirits are transformation."* In all transformations, the seventh is the wandering spirit; the eighth, the returning spirit. To say "returning spirit" is to return to the original form of the generating hexagram. The rest follow this pattern.

Fifth section: Distinguishing *yīn* and *yáng* hexagrams.

**The *Qǐan* is Heaven, hence it is called the Father.**
The three *Sūn* (巽), *Lí* (离), and *Duì* (兑) are the daughters, derived from *Qǐan*.
The *Kǔn* is Earth, hence it is called the Mother.
The three *Zhèn* (震), *Kǎn* (坎), and *Gèn* (艮) are the sons, born from *Kǔn*.

**Yang hexagrams contain yin:**
A single yang line is the ruler, two are the people—*Zhèn*, *Kǎn*, and *Gèn* are yang hexagrams.
**Yin hexagrams contain yang:**
Two yin lines are the rulers, one is the people—*Sūn*, *Lí*, and *Duì* are yin hexagrams.
When yang has one line as ruler, its principle is orderly, hence it is called the *junzi*’s Dao.
When yin has two lines as rulers, its principle is inverted, hence it is called the *xiǎorén*’s Dao.

**The sixth section: Revealing the Heart of Heaven and Earth**
According to the *Xuān Nǔ*’s *Lóng Tú* (龙图), the sixth line appears at *hài* (亥), marking the position of the tenth month’s aged yin.
Yin reaches its blackest extreme here.
Six is the number of yin.
Moreover, *Qǐan* and *Kǔn* are the sovereigns of yin-yang transformation.
The seven days of *Lái Fù* (来复) never depart from the forms of *Qǐan* and *Kǔn*.
The yang of *Qǐan* is the nine; the yin of *Kǔn* is the six.
From *Jiànzǐ* (建子), when one yang is born, to *sì* (巳), it belongs to *Qǐan*.
From *Jiànwǔ* (建午), when one yin is born, to *hài* (亥), it belongs to *Kǔn*.
The distance between *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午) spans six days at *hài* above—thus six days.
Six is the number of aged yin; when minor yang returns in *Lái Fù*, the seven-day pattern is clear.

Thus, one yin and one yang is called the Dao.
Even when yin is at its blackest in the tenth month, yang’s blackness lies beneath, hence it thrusts upward.
In the fourth month, when pure yang prevails, yin’s blackness is suppressed beneath, hence grasses wither and die.

**Yìdá says:**
The thirty days of the tenth month at *hài* (亥).
The Sage did not wish to speak of *Lái Fù* as occurring monthly, but only to assign one hexagram to six and seven days—this is incorrect.
How may it be proven?
In *Jìjì* (既济), the second line says:
*"The wife mourns her home—do not pursue it; in seven days, it will return."*
**Jiēwéi** says:
*"Seven days later, five changes become *Fù* (复), hence the allusion to seven days."*
**Lù Zǐyún** says:
*"All yin’s movements of retreat and return are fixed at seven days. Examining this, the meaning is evident."*

As for the month of *Jiànzǐ* (建子), the celestial wheel moves leftward, the earthly axis turns rightward—
the two black forces interact, giving birth to all things.
The following winter solstice, they return to their origins.
The "origin" is the heart.
Speaking of the two black forces, it is the advance of yang and retreat of yin.
At the summer solstice, yang’s blackness returns to *sì* (巳); at the winter solstice, yin’s blackness returns to *hài* (亥)—
hence it is called returning to the origin.

**The lower commentary:**
The *Yì* says:
*"Thunder in the earth—movement and rest."*
*"Returning reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth—returning to the origin."*
Heaven and Earth nourish all things with stillness as their heart.
They do not act, yet things act of themselves;
they do not give birth, yet things are born of themselves.
Silent and unmoving, this is the heart of *Qǐan* and *Kǔn*.

Thus, the *Yì* is "easy"—
yang and yin alternate, running without beginning.
Yang is its sovereign.
When yin advances, yang is concealed;
when yang returns, yin is diminished.
Day returns when night departs;
night arrives when day returns—
there is no moment without transformation.
The Sage observes its changes—
life and death, departure and return—
without error.

Hence some say that yang’s return is the heart of Heaven and Earth.
Yet the heart of Heaven and Earth manifests through things—
seeking it, it cannot be obtained.
The Master said:
*"What does the world think and ponder?
The world takes different paths yet converges;
it is unified yet holds a hundred concerns."*
The Sage’s heartlessness aligns with Heaven and Earth—
using things as its heart.
How could the heart depart?
Thus, seeking it does not bring it near,
and even seeking it earnestly does not bring it near.
Therefore, the great Sage holds it without possession,
walking within its midst.

**The seventh section: The Unfinished (*Wèijì*)**
The *Yì* is divided into two sections.
According to the *Qǐan Zuòdù* (乾凿度), the Master said:
*"Three yang and four yin—this is the proper arrangement."*
Thus, the sixty-four hexagrams are split into upper and lower,
mirroring yin and yang.
Yang is pure and odd, hence the upper section has three *jiā* (卦).
Yin is impure and mixed, hence the lower section has three *jiā* and four *jiā*.

The upper section begins with *Qǐan* and *Kǔn*,
the origins of transformation, the source of all things.
It concludes with *Kǎn* and *Lí*,
the symbols of sun and moon,
emanating from Heaven and rising from Earth,
capable of beginning and ending all things.

The lower section begins with *Xián* (咸) and *Héng* (恒),
the origin of male and female,
the Dao of husband and wife,
able to uphold ancestral temples as Heaven and Earth’s stewards.
It concludes with *Jìjì* (既济) and *Wèijì* (未济),
displaying warnings of prosperity and decline,
upholding the duty of ruler and subject,
clarifying discernment and caution to preserve the King’s Dao.

Thus, in *Jìjì*, the third and fifth lines of nine
lose the order of above and below,
warning the petty against misuse.
In *Wèijì*, the fourth and sixth lines of nine
embody the Dao of ruler and subject,
showing the light of the virtuous.

Great indeed is the Sage’s teaching!
Having achieved *Jìjì*, one must fear the calamities of *Wèijì*;
in *Wèijì*, one must be cautious in security, awaiting the time.
Thus, the beginning of *Wèijì* follows the end of *Jìjì*;
the end of *Jìjì* already touches the beginning of *Wèijì*—
its tail must also be touched.
Head and tail are contiguous;
beginning and end alternate endlessly,
cycling without rest, matching the two principles.
Alas! Having reached *Jìjì* and becoming full,
how can one not fear?
**The fourth line of *Wèijì*:**
*"Zhèn* uses force against the Ghostly States—
in three years, there will be rewards from the great kingdom."*
**Lù Zǐ** says:
*"Three years—the number of yang’s opening."*
The Dao of the *Yì* governs years by months,
months by days, days by weeks, days by hours.
Thus, when speaking of days, one *jiā* represents one hour;
when speaking of years, one *jiā* represents one month.
Hence three days and three years are both one-ninth of a *jiā*.

Seven days are the *jiā* of **one, nine, two, six**;
A decade and ten years are the *jiā* of **nine, six, seven, eight**.

The month has its void at the *xū* (beginning),
The year has its surplus at the *rùn* (intercalary month),
Thus when speaking of months, one combines the *jiā* of **seven, eight** and halves them,
To symbolize a *xū* decade;
When speaking of years, one takes the *yáo* of **nine, six** and makes them whole,
To symbolize an intercalary day.

Three decades make one *xū* month,
The decade of the eighth month corresponds to the extreme *yīn* *jiā*—twenty-four.
Three years make one *rùn* month,
The day of one *rùn* corresponds to **two** *piān* of *yáo*—three hundred eighty-four,
Thus three hundred sixty *jiā* correspond to the *qī* (period) day—
The void division is fully contained.
Three hundred eighty-four *yáo* correspond to the *rùn* day—
The surplus division is fully gathered.

This is the subtlety of the Sage,
Not convoluted in argument nor twisted in elaboration.
Otherwise, how could *yīn-yáng* odd-coupling naturally resonate with Heaven and Earth in hidden harmony?

**Accumulating Numbers: Method Eight**
The *Dàyuàn* number is fifty,
Its use is forty-nine—
One is left void and unused.
Though unused, it is used to make them flow;
Though not a number, it is numbered to complete them.
Thus, taking the forty-nine *cáo* with both hands and enclosing them,
It is like the undifferentiated chaos before division.
Dividing into two to symbolize *liǎng* (pair),
The *cáo* are split between left and right hands—symbolizing Heaven and Earth.
Hanging one to symbolize *sān* (three),
Taking one from the left hand and storing it in the little finger—symbolizing the Three Powers.
Rubbing with four to symbolize the four seasons,
First, counting the *cáo* in the left hand in groups of four.
Returning the remainder to the *guà* (hanging one) to symbolize the *rùn* (intercalary),
For the remainder of the four-fours is merged with the hanging one.
Five years require two *rùn* months,
Thus, after two *jié* (accumulations), the hanging is done again—
Taking the *cáo* from the right hand and recounting in groups of four,
The remainder is also merged with the hanging one,
Thus it is called "later hanging."
Doing this once with the *dié* (tray),
Not five, then nine;

The *èr sān* butterfly [method], not four then eight.
Exhaust the three *tā* [rubbings], and one *yáo* [stem] is complete.
Eighteen transformations, and one *guà* [hexagram] is complete.

**Yīnyáng Lǜlǘ Tú** [The Diagram of Yin-Yang Pitch-Pipes], the Ninth

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor commanded Ling Lun to take the longest pipe from the Kunlun Mountains in the western regions of Great Xia, and fashioned twelve *pú* [pipes], tuning them to the six calls of the male phoenix and the six calls of the female phoenix. From the pure *gōng* [tone], all could be generated. Thus, the Yellow Bell became the foundation of the *lǜ* [pitch-pipes].

Therefore, the initial *jiǔ* [nine] of *Qián* [the Creative], the first of the *lǜ*, is the variation of *yáng* [male].
Taking six times its measure, with nine as the standard, the *Línzhōng* [Forest Bell] is obtained. Multiplying six by the nine of the Yellow Bell yields fifty-four—*Dàlǜ* [Great Pitch].

Therefore, the initial *liù* [six] of *Kūn* [the Receptive], the first of the *lǜ*, is the variation of *yīn* [female].
All follow the laws of Heaven and Earth in threes.

Nine and six are the Dao of *yīnyáng*, husband-wife, and parent-child.
Dissimilar types as parent-child: the Yellow Bell generates the Forest Bell, requiring the Great Pitch to produce [it].
Similar types as husband-wife: the Great Pitch must wed the Yellow Bell—this is the husband-wife relationship, and they can generate six months.
This is the sentiment of Heaven and Earth.

Moreover, when the *yáng* qi first returns to the *wù-jǐ qīng guān* [pure pentatonic tones of *wu* and *ji*], this is the mother of the Yellow Bell.
Once the fifth month’s *luó-bīn* [interaction] is attained, its *lǜ* is already entrusted to the eldest son, to be used at the winter solstice.
The Yellow Bell, from the eleventh month, begins to generate *yáng* qi and takes effect—this is the foundation of the *lǜ*.
Yet, in the fifth month, a *yīn* [female] arises; later, when the pure tone returns, it is entrusted and collected, giving birth only to *Zhònglǜ* [Middle Pitch].

According to the *Jìn Shū* [Book of Jin], Han Jingfang knew the numbers of the six *lǜ* and five tones, and the law by which sixty *lǜ* generate one another. From above generating below, it is always three generating two; from below generating above, it is always three generating four. *Yáng* below generates *yīn*, *yīn* above generates *yáng*, culminating in *Zhònglǜ*, and the twelve pipes are complete. *Zhònglǜ* above generates *Zhíshǐ* [Holding-Start], *Zhíshǐ* below generates *Qùmiè* [Departing-Extinction]; above and below generate one another, culminating in *Nánshì* [Southern Affairs], and the sixty *lǜ* are complete.

The variations of the twelve *lǜ* reaching sixty are like the sixty-four *guà* [hexagrams].
The law: *yáng* below generates *yīn*, *yīn* above generates *yáng*—
The Yellow Bell weds the Great Pitch and generates the Forest Bell.
The Great Gourd weds the Middle Pitch and generates the Southern Pitch.
The Forest Bell’s consort, *Luóbīn*, generates the Great Gourd.
The Southern Pitch’s consort, *Yízé* [Righteousness], generates *Gūxiǎn* [Ancestral-Wash].
*Yuànshè* [Original-Shoot] consorts with the Response Bell and generates the Clasp Bell.
The Clasp Bell’s consort, the Great Gourd, generates *Yízé*.
*Yízé* weds the Southern Pitch and generates the Great Pitch.
The Great Pitch generates *Luóbīn*.
*Luóbīn* consorts with the *wù-jǐ qīng guān* [pure pentatonic tones of *wu* and *ji*].
The pure tone then entrusts it to the eldest son.

The Yellow Bell is nine inches—this is the foundation of the *lǜ*.
Dividing by three and subtracting one, below it generates the Forest Bell, mutually generating until the fifth month, when *Luóbīn* interacts with *wù-jǐ*, entrusting it back to the Yellow Bell, thus generating the pure tone.

The longest pipe is one *chǐ* two *cùn* three *fēn* [12.3 inches]; subtracting the nine inches of the Yellow Bell leaves three inches three *fēn*, generating the Middle Pitch.

The Great Pitch is three inches seven *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one added; above it generates *Luóbīn*.
The Great Gourd is eight inches—this is three divided by three with one subtracted; below it generates the Southern Pitch.
The Clasp Bell is four inches two *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one added; above it generates *Yízé*.
*Gūxiǎn* is seven inches one *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one subtracted; below it generates the Response Bell.
The Middle Pitch, consorting with the Great Gourd, is three inches three *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one added; it generates *Zhíshǐ*.
*Luóbīn*, four inches nine *fēn*, begins as minor *yáng* and ends as the later husband—this is three divided by three with one subtracted, consorting with the *wù-jǐ qīng guān* [pure pentatonic tones of *wu* and *ji*].

The Forest Bell is six inches—this is three divided by three with one added; below it generates the Great Gourd.
*Yízé* is five inches six *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one subtracted; above it generates the Great Pitch.
The Southern Pitch is five inches three *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one added; below it generates *Gūxiǎn*.
*Yuànshè*, consorting with the Response Bell, is six inches three *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one subtracted; it generates the Clasp Bell.
The Response Bell is four inches seven *fēn*—this is three divided by three with one added; it consorts with *Yuànshè* as the leading voice.

*Zhíshǐ* is beneath the Yellow Bell’s domain and above the Middle Pitch’s generation.
Now it descends to generate *Qùmiè*, beneath the Forest Bell, and dare not fail to consort with *Nánshì*.
Thus the cycle is complete.
*Nánshì* generates *Diànbīn* beside [the sequence].
