**The Western Peak Mount Hua Record**

**Scripture Title:** *The Western Peak Mount Hua Record*. Compiled by Wang Chuyi of the Jin dynasty. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Records and Biographies* category.

**Preface to *The Western Peak Mount Hua Record***

Of old, those who sought to compound divine elixirs invariably entered renowned mountains and blessed lands, never confining themselves to lesser hills. Why? Lesser mountains lack true deities to preside over them, being instead inhabited by the spirits of trees and stones—aged beings of a thousand years, whose qi harbors perversity and who care not to bring fortune to humankind.

According to the *Classic of Mountains*, the peaks where one may refine the mind and concoct divine elixirs are Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, and Mount Song. The rest lie within the Central Plains or beyond the five marches of the feudal lords. Though mountains called "renowned" number in the hundreds, they cannot all be enumerated. Yet all these possess true deities within their bounds, or else reclusive earthbound immortals. They also nurture magic mushrooms. Should a practitioner of the Dao ascend such a mountain, its spirits will surely bestow blessings, and the elixir will assuredly be perfected.

My homeland, Jincheng, spans a thousand *li*, commanding the three rivers. Amid its rivers and peaks, the majesty of Mount Taihua stands preeminent. Taihua, embracing the Three Dukes in its embrace and rivaling the Four Sacred Peaks, forces even Zhongnan and Taibai to stand in awe, while Shouyang and Wangwu dare not vie for supremacy. To the west, it gazes upon the dimming twilight of Mu Valley; to the east, it beholds the dawn of Fusang. No summit surpasses it in height—only the vault of heaven crowns its peak. It has received the primordial essence of the Great Simplicity and the pure qi of the Metal Heaven, shaping the myriad things and presiding over the *dui* direction. Among the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, it is named "Utmost Perfection." It cradles the sun and moon, exhales and inhales clouds and mist, giving rise to towers beyond the realm of form, to landscapes not of this mortal world.

Among the Eighteen Water Palaces, its Chexiang holds a deep pool, where the southeast rivers and seas subtly connect through hidden earth veins. It is enshrined in the sacrificial canon as an enduring norm. Here, golden dragons are cast and jade tablets presented. When the Immortal’s Palm pierces the clouds and the Azure Dragon heralds the sun, a thousand peaks bow to the mountain, while mist and qi flow like rivers. The verdant hues brush against travelers’ robes, lingering long after they depart.

Then, as the slanting sun gilds the peaks, the Lotus Peak plays with hues—now golden, now jade—neither crimson nor azure, a thousand marvels beyond description. Amber pines glow at night, and the earth yields sweet springs, a national auspice. Thus, it is fitting that the Five Numinous Elders descend here, that the True Man of Hangu Pass conceals himself, that some in star-crowned feathered robes ride clouds to audience with emperors, or that others in jeweled chariots and feathered canopies mount dragons to behold the Great Veil. Summoning perfected sages and gathering divine spirits, Mount Hua becomes a grand assembly.

My friend, Master Wang Ziyuan, awakened early to guard the Dao, standing alone yet preserving harmony. He often told others: "I long to wander clouded groves with staff in hand, to raise a cup upon misty peaks—this aspiration has endured for years." Soon after his marriage, he abandoned his home for the renowned mountains, refining the Golden Fluid. If not Mount Taihua, where else would he fix his intent?

People said: "It is fitting." Thereupon, Master Wang took an old copy of the *Record of Mount Hua*, fearing omissions, and further consulted the *Illustrated Classic* of his prefecture and Liu Xiang’s *Arrayed Transmissions of Immortals*, gathering all accounts of Mount Hua to supplement it. He arranged each entry in its proper place, ensuring nothing was misplaced.

Viewed through its landscapes, the peaks and caves, forests and valleys, cliffs and grottoes, pools and wells, streams and ravines, springs and deep pools—all may be seen. Viewed through its temples and sanctuaries, the palaces and monasteries, alchemical furnaces and altars where deities descend—all may be known. As for its medicinal produce, the *fuling*, *acorus*, *asarum*, and *aster*—all meet the Flame Emperor’s selection. Recording its immortals, the Pure Void Lord Pei, the White Ram Lord, Huang Chuping, and the Sixteen Perfected Ones—all are included. Even the Jade Emperor’s feasts here do not concern the mortal realm.

Alas! The immortal traces and sacred vestiges of Mount Hua are now fully encompassed, nothing left unrecorded.

Herein lie but seventy-odd essays, entrusted to craftsmen for carving onto woodblocks, that their circulation may be wide—how could this be deemed a trifling contribution? Once completed, I was entreated to compose a preface to crown the work. Though I demurred, I also rejoiced, saying: My talent is meager as the clouds of Qi, too weak to wield the thousand-jūn brush. Yet I delight to see that your aspiration is mine as well—I too long to enter the famed mountains and concoct the divine elixir, though the path remains unclear. Now that you have accomplished this, you have fulfilled my own desire.

In truth, to enter the famed mountains and concoct the divine elixir, one must have a foundation. As the *Book* states: The shaman invokes spirits, and spirits must attend; the image is set, and the deity must preside. How much more so for refining immortal medicines within the sacred peaks—would the mountain’s true spirits not protect me? The elixir’s completion may be awaited at once.

Yet do not assume the azure heavens are empty, that the white dragon will descend to bear you away, that one morning you will ascend to the Dark Continent, meet the assembled immortals, soar through the Purple Empyrean, pay homage to the Great Unity, listen to the Music of the Spheres, feast on the Nine-Fold Fungus, and wander without losing sight of other paths. There are the hidden words of the heavens, the numinous chapters of the Void—let us pledge to pursue these together on another day.

Written in the twelfth month, the *ren-shen* day of the *gui-mao* year of the Dading era, by Liu Dayong of Niyang.

**Preface by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang**

Heaven has its four seasons, with the stars and constellations marking their positions; earth has its five directions, with mountains and peaks anchoring their domains. When yin and yang harmonize, the forms of things take shape; when the two essences of *qi* intersect, the divine and luminous manifest.

The Western Peak, Mount Taihua, governs when *shaoyin* holds sway, when all things bloom—hence its name, Huashan. Seated in the west of the Central Land, it occupies the seventh palace’s true position, thus called the Western Marchmount. Consulting the maps, one sees its sheer, four-sided form—undeniable; measuring its height with a gnomon, one finds it towers five thousand *ren*—unmistakable. Its stone walls rise in majestic splendor, its might unyielding; the surrounding mountains rush forth in homage. Its *qi* is solemn, its presence awe-inspiring; its nature aligns with metal, its celestial hour corresponds to *you*. Before it lies Huayang Valley; behind, it presses upon Huayin Prefecture. To its left, it cradles the Peach Grove Barrier; to its right, it yields the jades of Lantian. Below lie the golden tripods and stone chambers of adepts and perfected beings; above dwell the Bright Star Jade Maiden, the immortal herbs, and the nectar of jade.

*The Record of Mount Hua*
Compiled by Wang Chuyi, the Recluse of Lotus Peak

*The Huazhou Illustrated Classic* records in *The Annals of the Zhaowen Pavilion*: The Lotus Flower Peak comprises three summits, their heights touching the Three Luminaries. Within it lie twenty-eight stone pools, corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Green pines and verdant bamboo thrive upon the lofty ridges; clouds and mist gather in swirling embrace about the secluded hills. Here, a trove of gold and jade lies concealed, harboring the winds and thunder—this is the Great Emperor’s detached palace, the very grotto-dwelling of immortals and transcendents.

*The Gazetteer of Regions* states: Mount Hua stands within the bounds of Huayin County, Huazhou. Huazhou, according to *The Tribute of Yu*, falls under the celestial division of Yongzhou. In the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, his younger brother You was enfeoffed at Xianlin, establishing the state of Zheng. By the eleventh year of Duke Wu of Qin, Zheng was made a county. Later, the First Emperor of Qin divided the realm into thirty-six commanderies, placing Zheng under the jurisdiction of the Neishi. The Han dynasty assigned Zheng to the capital district of Jingzhao. The Western Wei established Huazhou. Through the Sui, it remained part of Jingzhao, until the first year of Emperor Gong’s Yining era, when it was formally designated Huazhou. In the second year of Empress Wu Zetian’s Chuigong reign, it was renamed Taizhou. During Emperor Zhongzong’s Shenlong era, it reverted to Huazhou. In the first year of Emperor Suzong’s Shangyuan reign, it was renamed ZhenGuo Army, only to be called Taizhou again in the second year. In the first year of the Baoying era, it reverted once more to Huazhou. In the fourth year of Emperor Zhaozong’s Qianyou reign, it became Xingde Prefecture. In the second year of the Guanghua era, it was restored to Huazhou. The Song renamed it ZhenTong Army, and Huayin was accordingly named Huayin County. Later, it was variously called Taihua County, Jinyin County, Ningtai County, and Xianzhang County.

**Lotus Flower Peak**
Ascending forty *li*, it stands solitary at five thousand *ren*. At its summit lie the detached chambers of the Bright Star Jade Maiden, the central shrine of the Golden Heavenly King, the Twenty-Eight Constellation Pools, Black Dragon Pond, the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basin, Sweet Flag Pool, Sky-Gazing Pool, Eight Trigrams Pool, Great Unity Pool, and the Supreme Spring. Nearby is the Jade Well, where thousand-petaled white lotuses bloom; those who partake are said to ascend as immortals. An ancient poem reads:
*At the peak of Great Hua, the jade-well lotus,*
*Ten fathoms wide its blooms, its roots like boats.*
*Fair as frost and snow, sweet as honey,*
*A single petal in the mouth cures all ills.*
*I long to seek it, undeterred by distance,*
*Yet the azure cliffs offer no path to cling.*
*If only a ladder stretched to pluck its fruit,*
*To plant its seeds in the seven marshes, roots entwined.*

**Supreme Mountain**
**Laozi’s Grotto**
**Supreme Spring**
**Sweet Flag Pool**
**Laozi’s Alchemical Furnace**
When Laozi witnessed the decline of Zhou, he journeyed west beyond the Flowing Sands to the Hangu Pass. Yin Xi, the Pass Keeper, divined from the black aura that a true sage would soon pass, and indeed, he encountered Laozi. Recognizing Yin Xi’s extraordinary nature, Laozi composed for him the two-part *Book of Dao and Virtue*, then retreated into seclusion on Mount Hua. *The Annals of the Zhaowen Pavilion* states: Lotus Flower Peak is also called Supreme Mountain. Its four faces are sheer-cut, rising five thousand *ren*. Encircling ridges converge, three peaks thrusting skyward, their summit spanning ten *li*, where neither bird nor beast dwells. On the southeastern spur of its summit lies Laozi’s Grotto; to the north, the Supreme Spring. Beside the spring is Laozi’s Sweet Flag Pool, where the sweet flag’s leaves are as slender as a sword’s spine, its roots bearing nine nodes per inch. Consuming it strengthens the body, prolonging life and enhancing vitality. On the northeastern spur of Canglong Ridge stands Laozi’s Alchemical Furnace. At Xixin Flat, on the southwestern corner of the mountain’s summit, a plot of three to four *mu* is entirely overgrown with *Asarum*, whose consumption imparts a fragrant aroma to the body, perceptible a hundred paces away. Ancient records describe a plant resembling silk or cloth—what is now called "Western Peak Cloth."

**Purple Mulberry**
Atop the northeastern spur of the mountain’s summit grows the Purple Mulberry. Its leaves exude a jade-like dew; when collected in an oil-silk pouch on the fifth day of the fifth month, those who consume it may become earthbound immortals.

**Five-Seed Pine**
Atop the southwestern spur of the mountain’s summit stands the Five-Seed Pine, its canopy flat as an overturned parasol. From it hangs green vine a hundred feet long, beneath which grows *fuling* in human form. At times, amber crystallizes, glowing at night like a lotus, by day like an ox’s eye. Those who consume it ascend to distant realms, and its resin may be used to write at night.

**Bright Star Jade Maiden, Jade Maiden’s Stone Horse, Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basin**
The shrine of the Bright Star Jade Maiden stands upon the tortoise-shaped back of the central peak’s summit. Within the shrine’s hall is a stone chamber housing a sacred statue of the Jade Maiden and a stone horse, whose divine nature is extraordinary—its neighing and stamping are heard at night. Hermits dwelling on the summit often witness these marvels. Before the shrine lie five stone mortars, each filled with water, known as the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basins. Their waters are jade-green and limpid, never depleting in drought nor overflowing in rain.

*The Scripture of Divine Mists* states: The Bright Star Jade Maiden holds jade nectar; those who partake attain transcendence.

**Jade Maiden’s Window**
The Jade Maiden’s Window lies on the southern spur of the Cloud Terrace Peak. Above it is a stone gate; entering a *zhang* or so, one ascends to a stone recess like a window, through which the detached chambers of the Bright Star Jade Maiden on the southern peak may be glimpsed.

**Stone Tortoise Steps**
The shrine of the Stone Tortoise Jade Maiden rests upon a rock resembling a tortoise. From east to west, it spans eight or nine paces; from north to south, over twenty *zhang*. Its two ends rise sheer, its form like a tortoise. Before it lie stone steps, cracked as if split, about five inches wide, their depth unfathomable. When objects are cast within, the sound from below lingers for the time it takes to eat a meal—this is the ancient site where memorials were presented to the mountain’s abode.

**Black Dragon Pond**
Black Dragon Pond lies on the southern spur of the summit, where the Sky-Gazing Pool and Black Dragon Pond are found. In times of drought, prayers for rain are invariably answered. In the second year of the Chongning era of the Song, the dragon was enfeoffed as Marquis Xianrun of Manifest Moisture.

**Cavern of Mystery Stone Chamber**
The Cavern of Mystery Stone Chamber of the Western Peak stands upon the northwestern spur of the summit, its four sides sheer.

Long ago, the Perfected Master of Pure Emptiness, Lord Pei, entered this chamber to cultivate the Dao with single-minded devotion. After twenty-three years of practice, he was visited by the abode of the Five Numinous Elders of the Mysterious. The stone chamber has two doors, one to the east and one to the west. The entrance is barely wide enough for a person to pass, but once inside, the chamber expands to five or six *zhang* in circumference. The eastern door opens onto the clouds and mist, while the western door overlooks the earth below. Within stands a stone statue, three *chi* tall, wearing a crown of the Three Luminaries and the Embracing Dawn. Its stone robes bear patterns like those of nine-colored brocade, and the statue is adorned with many ancient coins—some with one head and many legs, others with a single hole and one side inscribed with the characters "Great Cloth" in large seal script.

**Counting Field and Reed-Flower Pool**
The Counting Field lies atop the summit. During the Later Wei, the Daoist Master Kou Qianzhi, well-versed in the armillary sphere and particularly skilled in celestial portents, once calculated the Heavenly Origin and Five Eras. His calculations contained errors, but later, the Perfected Master Cheng Gongxing arrived in feigned madness, posing as a merchant. He waited for Kou to cast his counting rods, and only then did the calculations align. Kou, filled with remorse, withdrew to the mountains and forests, following the Perfected Master and abandoning his remaining calculations. The counting rods transformed into water caltrops and reeds—hence the name Reed-Flower Pool.

**Twilight Stone**
The Twilight Stone stands atop the summit’s southeastern spur, upon a solitary peak.

From afar, a stone appears square as a well-side couch, truly resembling a *go* board at dusk.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a figure suddenly appeared before him—clad in feathered robes and a star-crowned cap, riding a cloud chariot drawn by a white deer, descending from the heavens. The emperor, startled, asked who he was. The figure replied, "I am Wei Shuqing of the mountains." The emperor said, "If you are a man of these mountains, then you are my subject." Suddenly, Shuqing vanished. The emperor, filled with regret, immediately dispatched his envoy Liang Bo to the mountains to search for Shuqing, but he was nowhere to be found. Only his son, named Du Shi, was located. The emperor asked, "Where is your father?" Du Shi replied, "My father, from youth, favored the Dao of immortals. He abandoned his family and entered Mount Hua over forty years ago." The emperor then sent Liang Bo and Du Shi to seek him at the summit of Mount Hua. There, they glimpsed his father playing *bo* with several immortals upon the stone, enveloped in thick purple mist. Several youths bearing banners and staffs stood behind them. Du Shi and the others prostrated themselves in reverence from afar. Shuqing asked, "Why have you come?" Du Shi said, "The emperor regrets that the other day, in haste, he failed to speak with you." Shuqing replied, "Previously, I was sent by the Supreme Lord to admonish the emperor for his reckless extravagance. Yet the emperor, arrogant and self-important, sought to make me his subject. He is unworthy of speech—that is why I left." He then sternly warned Du Shi, "Beware of becoming a Han minister, and do not speak of this to the emperor." Liang Bo and Du Shi then bowed in farewell and returned. This account appears in *The Biographies of the Immortals*.

**Stone Immortal**
**Waterfall**
**Stone Immortal Cave**
**Zhaoyang Cave**
**Zhengyang Cave**
**Xixuan Cave**
**Water Curtain Cave**

The Stone Immortal lies midway up the northern face of the mountain. *The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states: "The mountain’s cavern extends three hundred *li* deep, within which are jade terraces and chambers. Its trees are fragrant grasses and lush groves; its azure springs flow with stone marrow and golden essence. From afar, the cavern appears roughly a *zhang* in circumference. A bird’s path cuts off all passage, and few human traces reach it. At times, clouds of strange hues emerge. At the cavern’s mouth rests cinnabar stone, while nearby green stone resembles an immortal painted in ink and cinnabar—crown, robes, and garments all perfectly rendered, its height and proportions like those of a human. Thus, it is called the Stone Immortal. Above it hangs a waterfall, cascading straight down over three thousand *zhang*. The Stone Immortal Cave is also known as the Water Curtain Cave. The mountain possesses four caves: to the east, Zhaoyang; to the west, Xixuan; to the south, Zhengyang; and to the north, Water Curtain."

**Crab’s Abandoned Cave**
The Crab’s Abandoned Cave lies on the northwestern peak of the summit. *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* records: "On Mount Hua dwells a beast with wings, six legs, and the body of a serpent. When it emerges, the world suffers great drought."

**Giant’s Palm and the Stone Moon**

The Giant’s Left Palm features a half-wheel Stone Moon atop the northeastern peak. *The Diagram of Hidden Mechanisms for Mountain Opening* states: "The Giant attained the Dao of Primordial Mystery and was born simultaneously with primordial *qi*, serving as the master of the Nine Ancestors of Chaos."

Emperor Wu of Han once observed the Immortal’s Palm within the county and specially established a shrine to the Giant Spirit there.

**Marvels of Mount Hua**

The summit of Mount Hua is a place where celestial perfected beings descend and immortals gather, with countless manifestations of divine presence. Here are but a few examples:

At times, one first detects an extraordinary fragrance, then beholds auspicious mists. Sometimes, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders appear; at others, jade maidens and golden lads, or hundreds of youths with double topknots. One may see a thousand feather-robed Daoists in *yu* meditation, or pearl-canopied golden parasols, or crimson staffs and rainbow banners. Some witness riders on dragons or tigers, or visitors astride phoenixes and simurghs. At times, golden light fills the earth; at others, flames stretch to the heavens, or purple haze soars into the sky, or propitious clouds blanket the summit. The tolling of golden bells may also be heard.

These apparitions vary in form and location—sometimes on the highest peak, sometimes atop the Immortal’s Palm Peak, or gathering on Three Ministers Mountain, or assembling at the Western Mystery Cave.

In former times, the Perfected Master of Pure Emptiness, Lord Pei, secluded himself on the northwestern peak. Once, the Five Numinous Mysterious Elders of the Central Direction descended upon the Great Luo Peak. The Queen Mother of the West appeared several times, now clad in yellow robes, wearing a golden crown, riding a jeweled carriage drawn by nine multicolored, spotted dragons. Above her was a feathered canopy, flanked by golden lads, jade maidens, immortals, and celestial officials—numberless in their ranks. Later, a shrine was built at the site of her manifestation.

During the Zhenguan era of the Tang, a Temple of the Queen Mother was constructed at the mountain’s base. To the west of Mount Hua lies a mountain called Luofu, where in the fifth year of the Dali era, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water descended. Their visitation moved Emperor Daizong in a dream, prompting him to order the construction of the Three Officials’ Abbey. By the Xianping era, it was renamed the Temple of Heaven’s Mandate.

**Divine Grove**

Upon Mount Hua—whether on its slopes, within its valleys, or along the paths near its temples—all trees, whether living or dead, are called the Divine Grove. Their felling is forbidden, and those who violate this prohibition bring calamity upon themselves.

On the southwestern side of the mountain stands a grove of towering pines and cypresses, where the Mountain Spirit holds feasts. It is named the Black Mountain Grove. Those who secretly cut its trees have perished in fires or been devoured by tigers in great numbers.

**Imperial Path**

The Imperial Path lies north of the Immortal’s Palm Peak and serves as the route to ascend the mountain. Emperors Wu of Han and Xuanzong of Tang once traveled this way, hence its name. Today, stone mortars remain on either side, used in their time to anchor railings and drape brocade for protection against perilous drops.

To reach the peak, one must traverse the Imperial Path, cross the Azure Dragon, and pass the Cloud Terrace and Heavenly Well. The path descends steeply for a hundred *chi*. From the summit to the Green Branch Plateau spans twenty *li*, and from the Green Branch Plateau to the valley’s mouth, another twenty *li*.

**Zhang Chao Valley**

Zhang Chao Valley is where Zhang Kai, styled Gongchao of the Later Han, built his hut. Scholars gathered there like a marketplace. He was also capable of summoning a five-*li* mist, earning the place the name "Zhang Chao’s Misty Market." Each day, he would ride a donkey to the market and return in the evening, carrying a flask of wine.

**Stone Ram City and Immortal Valley**

Stone Ram City lies west of Zhang Chao Valley, where the brothers Huang Chuping and Huang Chuqi attained immortality. The valley is thus named Immortal Valley.

Huang Chuping, a native of Dan Creek, was sent by his family to herd sheep as a youth and did not return for a long time. His brother, Chuqi, searched for nearly forty years before hearing of a Daoist in the market who could divine fortunes with divine accuracy. Chuqi asked the Daoist, "In the Great Flower Mountain, there is a shepherd boy named Huang Chuping. Is he your younger brother?"

Chuqi bowed in gratitude and followed the Daoist into the valley, where he joyfully reunited with his brother. After their conversation, Chuqi asked, "Where are your sheep now?"

Chuping replied, "They are just east of the mountain."

Chuqi went to look but saw only stones before returning.

The brothers then said, "Let us both go together." Chuping then shouted at the stones, "Sheep, arise!" At once, all the white stones transformed into sheep—tens of thousands of them. Chuqi kowtowed and asked, "My brother, you alone have attained immortality. May I also learn the Way?"

Chuping replied, "If you are resolute, it can be achieved." Chuqi then abandoned his wife and children, bowed to his brother as his master, and later, both ascended together as immortals. The place where the stones were commanded is spacious on all sides, resembling a fortress; it is now called Stone Sheep City.

**Wenxian Valley**
Wenxian Valley was the secluded abode of the Perfected Lord Lü. When the Perfected Lord came here, he changed his surname to Ji and his given name to Dongming, with the Daoist name Baozhenzi. He dwelled beneath Huashan’s Lotus Peak, within Wenxian Valley, constructing a hut where he lived for forty years, unknown to others.

On the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *bingzi* year of the Shaoxing reign, he said to his disciple Liu Yu, "Elder Zhang and Mother Li have long awaited my ascent to the Mystery. I shall leave a verse:

*Above, one mouth; below, one mouth.*
*In the world, it is firm and true.*
*Though it holds water, it does not leak.*

Having entrusted these words to Yu, he serenely departed this world.

Liu Yu then concealed the remains in a stone chamber. Several years later, the Master’s spirit manifested at the pagoda in Sizhou, where he inscribed a poem:

*A scholar from Jizhou, transformed on Three Peaks.*

Years afterward, he appeared to Yu again, leaving another poem:

*Once I dwelled here long ago,*
*Forty springs concealed my name.*
*How many wanderers pass through this red dust—*
*Who among them knows this man?*

Yet another poem read:

*For ten years I toiled at brush and ink,*
*Ten thousand scrolls of verse and prose locked in my breast.*
*Like duckweed or drifting clouds, I made my home in green,*
*Dwelling on Lotus Peak, unknown to all.*

Later signed by Master Hui.

Yu searched for the place where the body had been seated and found only an empty coffin, within which lay two interlocking *lü* characters. From this, people at last realized he was the Perfected Lord Lü. The Perfected Lord had attained the Dao during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, and five hundred years had since passed.

During the Yuanfeng era, a poem on the zither terrace read:

*A rustic was I, a visitor from Tiantai,*
*With a dwelling south of Stone Bridge.*
*Father and son—just the two of us—*
*When the son sang well, I clapped in delight.*

Another poem said:

*A wanderer roaming the four seas,*
*Two flasks of frost and snow—my spirit’s essence.*
*When the trigram’s elements are gathered,*
*Dragon-tiger elixir moves like flowing mercury.*

His stele still stands in Wenxian Valley, now called Feather Valley Hermitage.

**Oxheart Valley**
Oxheart Valley was where Yang Zhen, in his early years, lived in seclusion, lecturing on the classics. Scholars gathered like a marketplace, and the valley was thick with locust trees, hence the name "Yang Zhen’s Locust Market." Among its cliffs, multicolored auspicious birds often appeared. Snow blanketed the mountain, and within it, the sacred traces of the Heavenly King could be seen—only his form clad in silver armor, mounted on a white steed, was visible.

**Yellow Spirit Valley**
Yellow Spirit Valley lies east of the mountain and was the secluded abode of the Perfected Yellow Reed Master. The Master, surnamed Ge and named Yue, was a native of Chu. He dwelled on this mountain, styling himself Lord of the Western Peak. Many came from a thousand *li* away seeking his healing, and those who sent only their names found their illnesses cured. He could restrain tigers and wolves so they dared not move, and birds dared not fly away.

Receiving instruction from Red Pine Master, he surpassed eighty years yet could lift a thousand *jin* and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. During a great drought, he summoned the dragon from the deep pool, urging it to ascend to heaven, and heavy rain fell. One morning, he rode away on a yellow dragon.

**Hidden Horse Valley**
Hidden Horse Valley lies east of the mountain. When Emperor Wu of Han sought immortals at the foot of Mount Hua, he built the Palace of Assembled Spirits, the Hall of Preserving Immortals, and the Gate of Gazing at Immortals. A divine horse emerged from Mount Hua, and the emperor ordered it kept in the imperial stables. The horse did not stay long, so men were sent to search for it. They found it in this mountain valley beneath a stone shelter, hence the names "Hidden Horse" and "Valley of the Hidden Horse Shelter." In the northeastern ravine, hoofprints remain imprinted on the stone.

**Maiden of Fur Peak**
Maiden of Fur Peak stands west of the mountain. The Maiden, named Yujian, was a palace woman of Qin Shihuang. Witnessing the fall of the dynasty, she took up her zither and retreated to this peak on Mount Hua to live in seclusion. She ate pine seeds and leaves, drank from mountain springs, and her body grew green fur. The world named her the "Maiden of Fur" after the place where she was seen, and to this day, the sound of zither music lingers in the cave. A Daoist once beheld this grotto. Below the peak stands White Stone Temple, long since abandoned.

**Cloud Terrace Peak**
Cloud Terrace Peak stands to the northeast of the mountain. Its two peaks rise sharply, sheer on all sides, crowned by radiant clouds above and rooted in earth’s veins below. Towering in solitary splendor, it resembles a celestial terrace. Beneath it lies a cavern. Long ago, a man entered this cave and emerged far away at Fangshan, having passed beneath the Yellow River’s bed, where he heard the sound of flowing water.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, the Daoist Jiao Daoguang dwelt alone on this peak. He abstained from grains, feeding only on mist and cloud essence. Three azure crows would foretell events yet to come. Emperor Wu personally visited the mountain court, leaning from his chamber to inquire of the Dao, and thus established Cloud Terrace Abbey at the valley’s mouth. Later, his disciples Hong Xian and others saw their master, Jiao Daoguang, ride away upon a creature like a qilin, never to return.

**The Trial Chisel Cavern**
On the northern face of Cloud Terrace Peak’s northern summit lies the Trial Chisel Cavern, a hundred feet high and unfathomably deep. Beside it stands a stone as hard as iron, its size and shape as though freshly chiseled—this is the cavern where Master Xiyi shed his mortal form.

**White Cloud Peak**
White Cloud Peak rises to the northeast of the mountain. It was the place where Princess Jinxian, sister of Emperor Ming of Tang, cultivated the Dao, naming it White Cloud Abbey. The Eight Immortals Cave, Viewing Peak Pavilion, Upper Bamboo Garden, Lower Bamboo Garden, jujube trees, chestnut groves, flower gardens, medicinal plots, and stone mortars remain there to this day. Beside White Dew Cliff lies the stone cavern of the Perfected Jiao.

**White Ram Peak**
White Ram Peak stands five *li* northwest of the mountain. Its layered cliffs gleam bright, its grottoes vast and misty. On the three Primes, the eight festivals, and all fasting days, divine lamps—sometimes three, sometimes five—appear upon the rock walls. Once, a recluse dwelt upon this peak, his name and surname unknown. He often rode a white ram through the mortal world. Later, he and his disciple Jie Dan ascended together as immortals, and so he was called the Perfected of the White Ram. The Perfected left behind his *Prohibitions of the Mountain* and seventy talismans for subduing tigers, leopards, wolves, and bears, which circulate in the world.

**Pine and Cypress Peak, Dawn Peak, Jade Pillar Peak, Jade Beauty Peak**
These four peaks are covered entirely in verdant pines and cypresses, perpetually veiled in clouds of strange hues. Their emerald summits rise in solitary grandeur, seldom trodden by human feet.

**Cavern of Master Jiao**
The Cavern of Master Jiao lies to the southeast of the mountain. The Perfected was surnamed Jiao, styled Xiaolong, a native of Hebei. He often consumed white stones, sometimes sharing them with guests, their taste like taro. Once, a wildfire burned his hermitage. When people from neighboring peaks came to see, they found the master seated calmly amid the flames. Though the hut was reduced to ashes, he rose unhurriedly, his robes untouched by scorching. Years later, when a great snow fell, he vanished. Suddenly, he appeared beyond the snow, clad in a single unlined garment, his complexion radiant as though it were summer. Some saw him as old, others as young—even now, some claim to encounter him.

**Divine Soil Cliff, Immortal Oil Slope, Evasion of Summons Cliff**
Divine Soil Cliff lies a hundred paces southeast of Cloud Terrace. When Jiao Daoguang concentrated his thoughts to build halls and corridors, divine soil welled forth from the stone. Though used without end, it ever renewed itself—so it remains today.

Immortal Oil Slope lies within the cliff face of Cloud Terrace Peak. Whenever Jiao Daoguang held vegetarian feasts or Daoist rites, oil descended from heaven upon this slope. After he rode the qilin away, the oil was seen no more.

Evasion of Summons Cliff lies southwest of Mount Hua. Here, recluses and fugitives of old concealed themselves to evade imperial decrees.

**White Deer Shelter**
White Deer Shelter stands to the east of the mountain, on the right of the path ascending the peak. It was established by the immortal Lu Nüsheng. A flying spring drips within the shelter.

Lu Nüsheng was an ancient immortal of Mount Hua who attained the Dao. She dwelt upon the mountain for two hundred years, her whereabouts unknown. Then, one day, she appeared before the mountain shrine, riding a white deer, accompanied by ten jade maidens. She bade farewell to the people and departed.

**Grotto of the Supreme Ultimate and All Immortals**
The Grotto of the Supreme Ultimate and All Immortals lies within the western cliff of Maiden of Fur Peak. Floating above is the cavern called the Grotto of the Supreme Ultimate and All Immortals, and below it lies Carriage Box Pool.

**Three Caverns of Wang and Diao**
The Three Caverns of Wang and Diao lie to the east of the mountain. The immortal Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a native of Poyang. Though married, he had no children. He was skilled in healing, curing all ailments without rituals, talismans, acupuncture, or medicine. When malevolent spirits caused mischief, he would draw a prison on the ground, strike a stone, and summon them—foxes, weasels, and serpents would appear, and he would slay and burn them.

The Perfected Wang had a bamboo basket, which his disciple Qian Ge carried with a nine-jointed bamboo staff for over a decade, never once seeing it opened. When he encountered Daoist adepts, he remained unassuming, and at night, torches would light his way. Later, he came to this cavern, where he found his friend Diao Ziran. Wang opened the bamboo basket and took out three five-tongued bamboo flutes. The three played together, and when Wang Yao departed, Diao Ziran said, “You should return soon. Do not linger long in the mortal world. We shall meet again in this cavern.” Later, Wang, Diao, and Qian Ge all ascended as immortals.

The upper cavern remains inaccessible. The middle cavern is barred by a flying stone at its entrance. The lower cavern is where recluses dwell.

**Azure Cloud Cavern and Azure Cloud Stream**
Azure Cloud Cavern and Azure Cloud Stream lie to the east of the mountain. They were the secluded abodes of four lofty recluses: Zheng Ao, Luo Yinzhi, Zhai Shiduan, and Zheng Yin.

Zheng Ao, styled Yun Sou, was a native of Southern Yan. Of unyielding integrity, he abandoned his wife and children. Hearing that the five-needled pines of Mount Hua, with their resin like congealed fat, could extend life and reverse aging, he came to this cavern to dwell in seclusion. During the Tiancheng era, when summoned to court as Reminder, he refused to rise, and was granted the title Master Carefree.

Luo Yinzhi was a Daoist of Jade Beam Abbey on Jade Bamboo Mountain in Xingan County, Linjiang Prefecture. He came to dwell on Mount Hua, sometimes by the water, sometimes upon the peaks, drinking wine and composing poetry, his lofty spirit at ease. During the Tianfu era, he was granted the title Master Xiyi.

Zhai Shiduan, styled Biaozheng, was a native of Qi. Well-versed in the Nine Classics, during the Xiangfu era, when Emperor Zhenzong visited Fenyin, he was summoned to court but did not rise. Without illness, he passed away; seven days later, his limbs remained warm. When cremated, a sound like thunder erupted, and a five-colored radiance blazed forth.

Zheng Yin, styled Mingchu, was a native of Fengfu in Dui. Upon his left arm was a black mole shaped like the Northern Dipper. He dwelled at the mouth of Wang Diao’s Three Caverns, never emerging from winter into spring, and people marveled at him. During the Xiangfu era, when Emperor Zhenzong offered sacrifices to the Earth Goddess and halted at the post station, an imperial edict was issued at the temporary palace, granting him the title Master Zhenhui. The emperor also bestowed upon him *The Return-to-the-Mountain Writ*, among the recluses of the Five Peaks. He often played the zither and raised his cup to suit his mood, reciting:

> By flowing streams I watch the water’s hue,
> At times I lean in stillness, listening to the pines.
> Through ten thousand ravines I wander, a joyful recluse,
> Amid a thousand peaks I dine, in perfect peace.
>
> I discourse on the subtle, delve into the profound,
> Nourishing my heart, I am called the Boundless.
> I leave the palace gates, return to mountain and forest,
> Rejoicing in your will—how deep your resolve!
>
> I scorn the fleeting splendor, cherish purity’s tone,
> With song and whistle, my carefree heart expands.

**Hugong’s Stone Chamber**
Hugong’s Stone Chamber stands atop a solitary peak in the northwest of the mountain, with a cavern large enough for over ten people and a spring within. To the northeast lies Wushi Valley, where the Eastern Valley holds the former grounds of the Northern Wei Daoist Kou Qianzhi, and the Western Valley contains the pierced stone couch of Master Xiuyang.

Hugong’s name and origins were unknown. He often suspended an empty gourd above his seat, and after sunset, he would leap into it. Fei Zhangfang studied under him and was made to dwell in this stone chamber. There was a square stone over a *zhang* wide; Hugong struck it with a straw rope and hung it in midair, then had Zhangfang sit beneath the outer stone while serpents and insects swarmed to gnaw at the rope. Though the rope nearly snapped, Zhangfang remained unperturbed, showing no fear. Hugong sighed in admiration: "You are teachable." He bestowed upon him the title Earthly Overseer and bade him ride a bamboo staff home. Later, upon reaching Ge Marsh, Zhangfang cast the staff into the water, where it transformed into a dragon and departed. He gained the power to command ghosts and spirits.

**The Three Lords’ Mountain Stone Chamber**
The Three Lords’ Mountain lies to the southeast of the peak, its three towering summits each distinct, resembling the Three Terraces. Thus, it is called the Three Lords. Yan Ji, styled Ziwei, lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. He dwelled in this stone chamber, consuming pine resin and yellow essence, his hair always unbound, save for a silk kerchief worn only on the first day of the month and festival days. At times, he played the zither and chanted poetry, and yellow and white clouds often shrouded him. Later, he bid farewell to his friends and departed upon a cloud.

**Changchun Stone Chamber**
The Changchun Stone Chamber lies beside Cloud Terrace Mountain. During the Zhenguan era of the Great Tang, the Daoist Du Huaiqian resided here. He abstained from grain and never ate, delighting in playing the long flute. He had many flutes purchased, and after playing each to its end, he would cast it into the ravine below. When his flutes were exhausted, more would be supplied from the ravine, and for months he remained unmoved. He styled himself Master Changchun. Today, the stone chamber still stands, and the sound of flutes lingers unceasingly.

**Master Xiuyang’s Stone Couch**
The stone couch lies within the Immortal’s Valley to the northwest of the mountain. In the stone chamber was a stone couch, upon which Master Xiuyang often lay, wearing it through. He never ate, and when Emperor Jing of Han asked, "What skills do you possess?" he did not answer but transformed into a stone sheep. Upon its back were inscribed the words: *Master Xiuyang thanks the Son of Heaven.* Later, the stone sheep was placed in the Tongling Terrace, but it vanished, its whereabouts unknown.

**Outer Immortal’s Flat**
Outer Immortal’s Flat lies within Zhang Chao Valley. There is a stone chamber where the True Man Zhang Chao shed his mortal form. As woodcutters and herders played nearby, a flying stone descended from the sky to seal the entrance. Today, it is known only as Outer Immortal’s Flat.

**Herb-Planting Flat**
Herb-Planting Flat was where the True Man Wang Hui often consumed pine resin and yellow essence. He possessed the art of commanding tigers and leopards, and whenever he planted yellow essence, he would harness them to plow and weed. He often rode tigers and leopards, guiding them with bamboo reins and a staff, his authority like that of a man riding a mule or horse. He frequently chanted a nine-character poem of over a hundred lines, the meaning of which no one could fathom. Later, he ascended to heaven and was seen no more.

**Liquor Spring and Jade Spring**
Liquor Spring lies directly below the Ancient Hermitage. Its waters bear a faint fragrance and mellow taste of wine, a national auspice that has repeatedly summoned phoenixes to drink. Beside it stands the shrine of the Jade Maiden. Jade Spring is situated at the mouth of Zhang Chao Valley; its waters are the color of cream, and thus the Jade Spring Abbey was established. Both springs brim with the essence of jade marrow, and those who drink them for long may cure deep-seated illnesses.

**Yellow Dragon Pool**
Yellow Dragon Pool lies at the mouth of Divine Valley. When prayers for rain are answered, the spirit is enfeoffed as the Marquis of Abundant Moisture.

**Chariot Box Pool**
Chariot Box Pool lies ten *li* within Immortal Valley, directly below the Cave of the Supreme Polarity and Assembly of Immortals. During the *Mingdao* era of Emperor Renzong of Song, the imperial court dispatched envoys each year to cast golden dragons and jade tablets into its depths. In the second year of *Chongning* under Emperor Huizong of Song, it was granted the title of Marquis of Bountiful Moisture by imperial decree. According to the *Record of the Water Palaces*, of the eighteen water palaces under heaven, Mount Hua’s Chariot Box Pool ranks as the seventh. It shares with the East Sea, South Sea, and Wen River the honor of receiving golden dragon tablets.

**Crane-Chariot Pavilion**
Crane-Chariot Pavilion stands halfway up the Central Peak, where the Golden Immortal Princess attained the Dao and ascended to heaven riding a crane.

**Divine Maiden Grove**
Divine Maiden Grove lies within Yellow Spirit Valley. To its east stands the Solitary Seated Maiden Shrine. The grove’s trees, numbering tens of thousands of pines and cypresses, form a dense canopy, and felling or gathering is forbidden.

**Ancient Wutong Avenue**
In the ninth year of *Taikang* under the Jin, Prefect Wei Junshi journeyed to the ancient shrine of the Western Peak. Along the path, wutong trees were planted in such numbers that none could count them. Beacon towers lined both sides, marked with characters from the *Thousand-Character Classic*, and grazing or gathering was prohibited.

**Tree of No Sorrow**
The Tree of No Sorrow stands beside the hermitage of Master Chen Tuan. The master, surnamed Chen and named Bo, styled himself Tunan, with the Daoist name Master Fuyao, was a native of Zhenyuan in Bozhou. During the *Changxing* era of the Tang, he sat for the imperial examinations but failed. Thereafter, he roamed mountains and rivers at will. Later, he came to the ancient site of Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua, cleared the brambles, and made his dwelling there.

He foretold fortunes and misfortunes with such precision that they matched as if tallying tokens. Later, Emperor Chai Shizong of the Later Zhou summoned him to court, detaining him within the palace for over a month. He was appointed Remonstrance Grand Master but firmly declined the post, and was bestowed the title Master of White Clouds. When Emperor Taizong of the Song issued his summons, Master Chen finally answered, donning a Huayang cap, straw sandals with dangling ribbons. He was received in the Yan Ying Hall with the courtesy due a distinguished guest, granted a seat, and engaged in prolonged conversation. The emperor then conferred upon him the title Master of Rare Serenity. His works, including *The Pointer of the Mysterious*, *The Fishing Pond Collection*, *Poems Crossing the Sea of Suffering*, *The Alchemical Formula for Entering the Chamber and Returning to the Elixir*, and *Parables of the Three Peaks*, circulated in the world.

**Upper Palace:** White Cloud Abbey
**Middle Palace:** Supreme Clarity Abbey
**Lower Palace:** Cloud Terrace Abbey (now the present-day abbey)
**Western Peak Perfected Lord’s Hall**
**Mount Hua Abbey**
**Deer Enclosure Abbey**
**Polaris-Welcoming Abbey**
**Taiping Xingguo Abbey**
**Queen Mother Abbey**
**Immortal Palace Abbey**
**Resting Root Cloister**
**Spirit Shrine of the Ministerial Divinity**
**Orchid-Stone Cloister**

The Upper, Middle, and Lower Palaces were all established by the Daoist adept Jiao Daoguang. During the *Tianbao* era of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, the Right Rectifier of Omissions and Academician of the Jixian Institute, Wei Bao, was commissioned to compose *Records of the Three Palaces’ Restoration*.

The Western Peak Perfected Lord’s Temple was renamed Chongning Wanshou Abbey during the *Chongning* era, then Baoxiao Guangxiao Abbey in the *Shaoxing* era, and later Yingxiang Abbey in the *Fuchang* era. Formerly, Minister Sima Guang memorialized the throne to establish Perfected Lords of the Five Peaks across the realm, bestowing upon them golden tablets to eternally guard the grotto-heavens and blessed lands.

Mount Hua Abbey was constructed by Emperor Wu of the Han. Later, during the *Xiangfu* era, it was revived in honor of the Four Eminent Recluses. Deer Enclosure Abbey originally stood west of Bamboo Valley Ridge but was relocated to the foot of Mount Hua during the *Daguan* era at the request of the Daoist Qiu Run. Polaris-Welcoming Abbey was built at the foot of the mountain during the *Xuanhe* era. Taiping Xingguo Abbey, originally within Pass Valley, was relocated to the foot of Mount Hua during the *Shaoxing* era at the request of the Daoist Jiao Xu. Queen Mother Abbey once stood beneath Great Luo Peak, with an ancient shrine, and was later reconstructed at the foot of Mount Hua during the *Zhenguan* era of the Tang. Immortal Palace Abbey was the residence of Princess Jinxian; after she ascended on a crane, it was repurposed as Immortal Palace Abbey. Resting Root Cloister, located within the Xiangxing district, was established during the *Taiping Xingguo* era when Emperor Taizong summoned the Daoist Resting Root to court, bestowing upon him a complete canon of scriptures and a poem upon his return to the mountain. He was granted the title Great Master of Serene Crags. His *Three Hundred Poems of Resting Root* circulated widely in the world. Orchid-Stone Cloister had long fallen into ruin, leaving only the Shrine of the Giant Spirit, originally constructed by Emperor Wu of the Han.

**Altar of the Mountain Worship**
The Altar of the Mountain Worship was the site where Emperor Wu of the Han performed sacrifices. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang, it was renovated into the Zhenyue Yiling Xian Temple, later known as Sheng Hui Cloister or Zhaoqing Temple.

**Proclamation of Blessings Pavilion**
The Proclamation of Blessings Pavilion, where Emperor Zhenzong of the Song worshipped at the mountain altar, stood beside the Taihua Post Station. On the twentieth day of the seventh month in the fourth year of the *Tianxi* era, Emperor Zhenzong performed the rites here and bestowed the name Proclamation of Blessings Pavilion. An imperial stele was erected, its base carved with dragons, and the site was once designated forbidden ground.

**Plain Spirit Abbey**
According to the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* in the *Biography of Ma Zhou*: On Mount Hua stood the Plain Spirit Abbey, home to an Immortal King who governed all grotto-heavens, the Ten Continents, and the Three Islands, as well as the divine foxes.

**Grotto-Heaven of Ultimate Perfection**
According to the *Records of the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens*: The first is the Minor Grotto of Mount Wangwu, spanning ten thousand *li* in circumference. As Du Fu’s poem states: *"Vines span ten thousand *li* to the Chouchi Cavern, / Secretly connecting the Minor Heaven."* The fourth is the Western Mystery Grotto of Mount Hua, spanning three thousand *li* in circumference, named the Grotto-Heaven of Ultimate Perfection. Within this grotto, the heavens and earth are vast, with sun, moon, stars, wind, clouds, grasses, and trees no different from the external world—save that the sun and moon pause their wheels, their radiance brilliant, directly illuminating the firmament, creating a realm of eternal spring. Palaces and towers are all fashioned from the seven treasures of gold and jade, surrounded by purple groves and fragrant blossoms, with jade sap and golden stalks, all scenes of the grotto-heaven. The Perfected Plain Spirit composed a hymn for the Grotto-Heaven of Ultimate Perfection:

*"Exotic fruits and wondrous flowers defy all names; / Why seek the Perfected in Penglai’s isles? / Azure clouds array the heavens within the grotto, / White jade towers rise beyond all semblance. / Myriad ravines of orchids and irises coil through sheer cliffs, / A thousand peaks of mist and haze soar in towering splendor. / The Eight Immortals once divided golden elixirs here, / And after consuming them, the whole family ascended to Supreme Clarity."*

**Grotto-Heaven of the Assembly of Immortals**
According to the *Records of the Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens*: The first is the Grotto of Mount Huo, spanning three thousand *li* in circumference, named the Grotto-Heaven of Huolin. The second is the Grotto of Mount Tai, spanning three thousand *li* in circumference, named the Grotto-Heaven of Pengxuan. The third is the Grotto of Mount Hua, spanning three hundred *li* in circumference, named the Grotto-Heaven of the Assembly of Immortals. The Perfected Plain Spirit praised it thus:

*"A fallen stone became an immortal, named the Seven Stars; / Five gates align with sun and moon along the mysterious path. / Clouds soar and rains scatter, vanishing into the heavens, / Yet still they govern the peaks and ridges, birthing wondrous names."*

**The Enfeoffment of Mount Hua’s Deity as the August Emperor of Golden Heaven**
The *Register of the August Emperor of Golden Heaven, the Compliantly Sacred*: The deity of Mount Hua commands clouds and summons rain, and among the western peaks, none is more revered. The Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan journeyed here to convene with the spirits; Emperor Shun gazed upon it to receive the feudal lords. From the Xia dynasty through the Sui, five lineages ruled over three thousand years, their sacrificial rites passed down without alteration. Altars and temples—what era has not restored them? Thrice-yearly sacrifices have never lapsed, for repaying the blessings of life and honoring the divine spirits has never ceased. Though the deity’s blessings are luminous, calamities and malevolence have never been absent.

The deity’s shrine lies at the mouth of Yellow Spirit Valley. During the *Yongguang* era of the Han, it was relocated north of the official road, where halls and palaces were constructed. Sacrificial rites and vessels were conducted with the same ceremony as those for the Three Dukes.

In the third year of the *Xianyuan* era of the Tang, *The Record of Mount Hua of the Western Peak* was completed.
