### *Records of Doubtful Immortals*, Fascicle One
By Master Hidden Jade Slip

The affairs of divine transcendents have existed since antiquity. Their traces, often concealed among the mundane, are not easily fathomed. I happened to record these accounts from among friends, without embellishment, and dared not rashly claim them as tales of immortals. Now, compiling various traditions into three chapters, I title this work *Records of Doubtful Immortals*.

During the reign of Emperor Ming of Tang, there was a man named Li Yuan who often wandered at the foot of Mount Hua, gathering herbs for sustenance. He was fond of wine, and the villagers below the mountain frequently offered him drink. One day, he suddenly mounted a white deer, raised his hand to the villagers, and said, “I now depart to roam Mount Tiantai.” Three old men blocked his path, wishing to detain him, and asked, “You have grown close to the people below the mountain—why this hasty farewell?” Li Yuan replied, “Elders, you do not understand: closeness must end in parting. I dare not defy the times by clinging to it.” The old men said, “You have eaten the herbs of Mount Hua and now journey to Mount Tiantai—what will you eat there?” Li Yuan answered, “On Mount Hua, I eat the herbs of Mount Hua; on Mount Tiantai, I shall eat the herbs of Mount Tiantai.” Knowing they could not detain him, the old men prepared a grass mat, poured thick wine, and offered it as a farewell libation. As Li Yuan stood at the crossroads, he left three medicinal pills for the three old men, saying, “Consume these quickly.” Then he mounted the white deer and departed. Soon after, his whereabouts became unknown.

Later, two of the old men ate the pills, while one did not. Within months, the one who refused died, while the other two lived to the age of one hundred and fifty before passing. Thus, people suspected Li Yuan was an immortal.

In Pu Prefecture, there was a wandering herb-seller who carried a medicine pouch on his shoulder, selling remedies without revealing his name. The people called him the “Herb-Selling Wanderer.” If one failed to purchase his medicine, their illness would never heal. In Pu Prefecture, there was a wealthy man named Wang Yu, of serene temperament and benevolent nature, skilled in medicine and healing. Observing the Wanderer’s extraordinary demeanor, he prepared fine meats and delicacies to invite him, intending to question him.

When the Herb-Selling Elder arrived at Wang Yu’s home, instead of bowing to Yu, he bowed to an old servant. Yu, attributing this to rustic manners, did not take offense. He poured a cup of wine and personally offered it to the elder, who laughed heartily and accepted it. After drinking, the elder said to Yu, “You wish to ask me something? Go ahead—no need for excessive courtesy.”

Yu then asked the Wanderer, “You conceal your name—who are you?”

The elder replied, “A man beneath heaven and upon earth.”

“Since man is formed by the qi of heaven and earth, his surname is ‘Man,’ and his given name is ‘Man.’ Why fabricate a name?”

Yu said, “You carry a single pouch of medicine to cure all ailments—what medicine is this?”

The Herb-Selling Wanderer answered, “Man’s illness is one—why speak of many? Man borrows qi to sustain his body; when qi is harmonious, the body is harmonious, and harmony means no illness. When qi is disharmonious, the body is disharmonious, and disharmony means illness. The root of illness is but one, yet the world insists on naming many—this is ignorance. My medicine is one, for the cause of man’s illness is one, and so I treat it with one.”

Yu asked, “Why are there those who purchase your medicine yet do not receive it?”

The Wanderer replied, “Life is truly difficult, death truly easy. To save one in health is life; to wait until illness strikes is already hard. To wait until illness lingers before saving—how can one live? When I do not give medicine to those who seek it, it is because salvation comes too late. My medicine is the medicine of inquiry, born among men. If one wishes to consume it for long life and enduring vision, one must first understand. To know life and death in treating illness is already merit enough. From youth, I have loved to take medicine and thus know well the nature of herbs. When their nature is understood, they can be used; when not, they will surely harm.”

Yu, recognizing his extraordinary nature, asked further, “Earlier, you did not bow to me but to the old servant—why?”

The Wanderer said, “The old servant is one of my kind. Seeing one of my kind, I could not help but bow.”

Yu said, “Then let me offer this servant to you as a disciple—would that be acceptable?”

The elder replied, “If you can part with him and give him to me, I will give you a scroll in return.”

Yu thus handed over the scroll and sent the servant to follow the Herb-Selling Wanderer. The elder departed, and the servant vanished without a trace, their whereabouts unknown. Yu read the scroll and gained profound mastery of medicine. Later, a Daoist priest visited him, insisting on seeing the scroll. Yu showed it to him, and both the priest and the scroll suddenly disappeared.

Zhang Yu, a man of Yan, sojourned in the capital and Luoyang, associating for nearly a decade with the dissolute sons of the wealthy, singing wildly and dancing drunkenly. One day, strolling alone along the Luo River, he beheld a scene of serene beauty: fragrant flowers, birds alighting on towering trees, and fine fish leaping in the long waves. He intoned aloud:

*“Floating life is but a dream—how long can it last?*
*Floating life is full of woes.*
*No one grants me long life’s guard—*
*By the Luo’s spring waters, I sing wild and bold.”*

As the last note faded, he suddenly looked up to see a jade-green pavilion by the water, its strings and pipes resounding clearly. Astonished, he exclaimed, “Who is this spring reveler?” Before the words left his lips, a maiden emerged from the pavilion, pacing slowly by the water’s edge, sighing to herself. Yu, unrestrained and untethered by nature, approached her without hesitation and asked, “Are you a goddess descended from the sunlit terrace? Have you come from Penglai or Yingzhou? Why do you sigh alone?”

The maiden started, her expression shifting, and after a long moment, she composed herself and said, “I was merely sighing to myself—why does this young man, so reckless and unbridled, dare to question me so boldly?”

Yu replied, “I am a free spirit between heaven and earth. From youth, I have indulged in poetry and wine. Seeing your beauty and hearing your sighs, I wished to hear a word from you.”

The maiden smiled faintly and pointed to the jade-green pavilion. “Come with me there.”

Yu followed her inside. She ordered a brocade mat laid out, took up her strings and pipes, and spoke and laughed with him as they drank from fragrant cups. As the sun set, she said, “Is not the human world fleeting? Spring is not yet spent, and autumn arrives. Youthful faces soon turn white. If one knows the world cannot be dwelled in and seeks the Dao, then one is truly worth speaking to.”

Yu lowered his head and did not answer. The maiden then sang:

*“Colored clouds enter the imperial realm,*
*The white crane circles once more.*
*To linger long is not permitted—*
*The path to Penglai is distant and long.”*

She sang again:

*“In vain one loves the guard of long life,*
*For one is not a long-lived person.*
*Today we part by the Luo River—*
*Alas for the spring within the grotto.”*

Then she bade Yu farewell and departed upon the Luo’s waves. Yu was greatly startled and suspected she was a water immortal.

The Qin-Bearing Scholar wandered Chang’an for years, spending his days in taverns begging for wine. He always carried a qin, speaking only when spoken to, and others thought him mad. Whether by the water or beneath the moon, he would take up his qin and play, his melodies always deeply moving. Li Taibai heard of him and, clasping his hand, led him out beyond the city walls. By the water, they sat on bamboo mats spread over the grass and drank together. Taibai asked him to play the qin. The scholar performed a tune, and Taibai was overcome with sorrow.

The scholar then said to Taibai, “People say the sounds of silk and bamboo delight the heart, yet the qin’s music wounds it. I thought you would not be wounded—did I not know you would be? This shows your body is free and transcendent, but your heart is not.”

Taibai, already suspecting he was an extraordinary man, heard these words and bowed, asking, “Sir, why are you so fallen in spirit? Is it your heart or your body that is fallen?”

The scholar replied, “Neither my heart nor my body is fallen. But the world calls this ‘fallen,’ so I dwell at the edge of that state.”

Taibai said, “If you know the world despises this ‘fallenness,’ why not change?”

The scholar answered, “If I despised it, I would change. Why should I change because the world despises it?”

Taibai then asked, “Sir, do you carry this qin only to play for your own enjoyment, or to bring joy to others?”

The scholar replied, “This qin is an ancient one. I carry it because I love the sounds of antiquity—who would seek to please others with it? The music within my qin is refined and pure, direct yet mournful. Those who understand its tones hear it and find joy; those who do not understand hear it and are only wounded. It is just like your writing—light and fluttering as butterflies dancing among flowers, cold and alluring as a maiden of beauty. Noble scions may call it fine poetry, but the truly discerning will not regard it as true literature.”

Taibai said, “My writing may be frivolous and seductive, unworthy of admiration, but does my bearing and spirit not reveal a transcendent talent?”

The scholar replied, “Your bones are mortal, your flesh common—you are no true immortal, only a man of rank. Moreover, your body is impure, your qi base; even your nobility will not last. Take care of yourself and do not let empty fame burden you.”

With these words, they drank together until drunk and returned. The next day, Taibai sought to bring him again to the tavern to drink, but he was nowhere to be found. Several days later, Taibai saw him beneath a great tree south of Chang’an. Overjoyed, he approached to speak with him, but the man suddenly vanished.

There was a man named Ge Yong who often wandered the roads of Qilong with a yellow dog. If someone offered him wine, he would drink but eat nothing. He enjoyed conversing with Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, and every night he slept in the wilds. The Daoist Wang Feng admired him greatly.

One day, Ge suddenly said to Wang, “Let us ride this dog together on a journey.”

Wang asked, “Can this dog be ridden?”

Ge replied, “This dog can run.”

They mounted the dog, which suddenly leapt into the air as if flying. In an instant, they had left the Central Plains behind, traveling over ten thousand *li*. They arrived at a mountain where peaks and ridges were strangely beautiful, the scenery serene and clear—unlike anything in the mortal world.

They dismounted the dog and entered a cave hand in hand. There, rare trees cast intertwined shade, and exotic flowers bloomed in profusion. Lofty pavilions and high terraces overlooked green waters. Soon, they entered a vermilion gate where three women emerged to greet them. Their jade-like beauty and graceful bearing were truly rare in the world, yet they seemed like old acquaintances.

They were led up to a tower where, leaning over emerald railings and parting crimson curtains, they were seated at a table of green jade. Served with fine wine, they drank together, the three women seated among them. In no time, zithers were plucked and flutes played, and all worldly concerns faded away. As dusk approached, they were half-drunk.

Ge then said to Wang, “These three women are all from the households of immortals, meeting here by chance on this mountain. I knew of them, so I brought you to visit. Now that we have drunk together, we should return.”

Should we linger here long, we must consider that it may hinder the women’s own wanderings and pleasures. Thereupon, he and Wang departed the grotto together, the three women seeing them off at the entrance. Ge turned and said to them, “Let us meet again on this day next year.” Having bid the women farewell, they once more rode the hound back. By the time they reached the fork in the ridge, three years had already passed.

Ge then said to Wang, “I was merely traveling east for a time—you should remain here.” With that, he vanished, and never returned thereafter.

In western Shu there lived a man named Peng Zhiwei, a man of the same ilk as Zhuang and Zheng, whose family fortune numbered in the thousands. He had but one daughter, who from childhood had been fond of the Dao. She once entreated Zhiwei to let her read Daoist texts and follow the teachings of the Dao, but he refused. When she turned sixteen, a boy riding a white crane suddenly flew into Zhiwei’s home and said to her, “I am a follower of the Dao. Hearing of your devotion, I have come to instruct you.” The girl, overjoyed at the sight of him and even more so at the prospect of his teaching, secretly concealed the boy and his crane.

After several days, a maidservant discovered the matter and asked, “What manner of spirit is this, that you would hide him so? If your father learns of it, will he not suspect impropriety?” The girl replied, “Say nothing of this. Once I have received his instruction, I shall send him away.” That very night, she fasted, purified herself, and lit incense in reverence before the boy.

The boy said to her, “Your heart’s devotion to the Dao has not wavered—you are certain to attain it.” The girl asked, “But those who study the Dao must first read Daoist texts and receive the registers of methods. I am confined to the women’s quarters, and my father will not permit it—what am I to do?” The boy replied, “If your heart is truly set on the Dao, you are no different from those who pursue it. As for those of old who ascended to the clear heavens in broad daylight, did they rely on reading texts or receiving registers? The Way of immortals lies inherently in one’s natural spirit and innate qi. Thus, the Queen Mother of the West once told Emperor Wu of Han that he lacked the bones of an immortal and was slow in spirit.”

The girl asked again, “Living in the world of men, wearing their clothes, eating their food—is it not difficult to return to the Way of immortals?” The boy said, “Not so. If your heart yearns for the Dao of immortals with unwavering devotion, you will move the immortals themselves. Once moved, they will surely record you. To be recorded is to have one’s name inscribed in the registers of immortals. Knowing this, one’s fate is subtly ordained, and there are those who attain it by consuming herbs and abstaining from grains. Yet if one retreats into the depths of empty mountains, far from the world of men, wearing clothes of grass and toiling day and night in austerities, but their heart wavers between resolve and doubt, then even if they consume herbs and abstain from grains, what hope have they?”

The girl bowed again and said, “If this is so, what then shall you teach me?” The boy replied, “Your spirit already reaches the immortals, and your qi is no longer that of the common world. If your heart now swears to remain steadfast unto death, you will soon ascend as an immortal.” Having spoken, he rose to take his leave, saying, “The Way of immortals is fully contained in these words. Cultivate them with reverence. Now, I depart.” With that, he mounted his crane and flew away.

The girl said to her maidservant, “I have grasped the Dao—I shall attain it.” Soon after, she renounced rich flavors and fine adornments, sitting in silent meditation. One day, she vanished without a trace.

Liu Jian was a man of Qi, wealthy and devoted to the Dao. Whenever he heard of a famous mountain where immortals were said to dwell nearby, he would take up his staff and journey there alone. He consumed every medicinal herb he found in the mountains. In the early Kaiyuan era, he traveled to Mount Bagong to observe its marvels when he suddenly encountered a man who called himself Master Void. The master said to Jian, “I, too, am one who pursues the Dao. Meeting you here by chance, I shall accompany you in this place, and later, we may visit another famous mountain together.”

Delighted by his words, Jian replied, “I love to wander the mountains of immortals—who would have thought I would meet you here?” Master Void then said, “Not far east of here lies a famous mountain, rich with the presence of immortals. Shall we go?” Jian replied, “I would gladly follow you.” After traveling east for several days, they saw only mountains and rivers, utterly remote from human paths.

At last, they reached a great mountain and rested at its foot. Master Void said to Jian, “We have now journeyed over ten thousand li beyond the dusty world. Entering this mountain, you will see how it differs from those of the mortal realm.” They proceeded together and soon came upon a great bridge, towering and steep. Ascending its perilous heights, they saw that the railings on either side were adorned with pearls and kingfisher feathers. Presently, they arrived at a dwelling. On all sides, the mountain peaks were like paintings, and above the gate hung a plaque that read: *Residence of Master Void*.

Jian, astonished, asked, “Why does it bear your name?” Master Void smiled and said, “Come inside.” Entering the gate, they saw pavilions and terraces unlike anything in the world of men. The master then led Jian to a waterside pavilion, where they sat together. Soon, several young attendants in blue robes stood in attendance, offering only pearl-like fruits and fragrant wine.

Master Void pointed to a plant by the water and said to Jian, “This herb alone differs from all the medicines of the mortal mountains.” Jian eagerly begged for it. Master Void instructed a young attendant to pole a small boat across the water and gather the plant’s seeds for Jian. Jian tucked them into his robe and rose to say, “You must live here—I shall return.”

Master Void stood to bid him farewell, saying, “Do not trouble yourself further with wandering famous mountains in search of immortals. Simply plant these seeds and eat their shoots—you will attain longevity. There is no need to wait for ascension as an immortal.”

Master Void added, “Retrace your path homeward, lest you lose your way.” Jian followed his advice, found the old road, and returned to his village. There, he planted the seeds by the water, gathered the shoots himself, and consumed them. Over a hundred years later, his hair remained unturned by white. One day, he suddenly took leave of his family and neighbors and departed—no one knew where he went.

Yin Fu’s *Jade Tablet* records:

Dongfang Xuan, a man of Jingzhou, built a thatched hut at the foot of South Mountain and dwelt there. He and his wife, née Fan, both cherished the Dao. One day, a Daoist wanderer passed through the mountains, and Xuan invited him into their hut. He carved bamboo into dried meat, drew water to make wine, and received the traveler with courtesy. The Daoist was greatly astonished. Then, Fan transformed a bamboo staff into a great flying bird, mounted it, and soared away. In an instant, she returned, clutching a go board, and said to the Daoist, “I wish to play a game with Xuan.” The Daoist, deeply perplexed, asked, “Where did you fetch this board?” Fan replied, “I went to my companion’s home by the Southern Sea.” The Daoist asked, “Who is this companion?” Fan said, “This companion also possesses minor arts and often comes to play with me. If my master would but wait a moment, she will surely arrive.” The Daoist then asked Xuan, “What arts are these? How did you and your wife come by such abilities?” Xuan replied, “I once happened to marry this Fan as my wife, and she passed these arts to me. Yet I have never known from whom she herself first learned them.”

As the Daoist spoke with Xuan, strains of silk and bamboo music drifted from the sky. In an instant, a woman of exquisite beauty descended from the air, laughing as she addressed Fan: “Why have you summoned this vulgar wanderer?” Fan replied, “This Daoist passed by the mountain, and I merely invited him—unlike Dongfang Xuan.” The woman asked, “Why not play a game?” Xuan then said, “Companion, go and amuse yourself. I shall converse with this Daoist.” The woman immediately traced a circle on the ground with her hand, and it transformed into a vast pool, encircled by towering pines and verdant bamboo. The banks were lush with fragrant water caltrops and lotuses, and at its center floated a painted boat. The woman boarded it, while Fan hastily tossed a single clog into the water—it became another painted skiff. Each plied her oar and sang, their voices clear and plaintive, deeply moving. The Daoist wept and sighed, “I have studied the Dao for over fifteen years, traversing mountains in search of herbs, never once resting, yet I have never met such people. Who would have thought these ladies possessed such immortal arts?”

The woman and Fan, seeing his reaction, disembarked from their boats with displeased expressions. After a long silence, the woman scolded the pool, and in an instant, the water, pines, bamboo, lotuses, and painted boats all vanished at her command. Then, each mounted a bamboo staff and ascended into the sky. Xuan smiled at the Daoist and said, “Master, you should return now. Do not linger here.” The Daoist bowed in thanks and departed.

The following year, the Daoist passed by again and inquired after them. The villagers at the mountain’s foot all said, “Dongfang Xuan has moved his family deep into the distant mountains.”

Li Yang, a man of Shu, had studied the Dao for over a decade with unwavering resolve. Once, by the riverbank, he saw a great tortoise, white as jade, and marveled at it, taking it in to care for it. Three years later, the tortoise suddenly rose into the void and vanished. Seven days later, it returned. Yang then addressed it, saying, “The Dao of immortals is profoundly mysterious, beyond all fathoming. Ever since I glimpsed the scene of *One Pure* and beheld the affairs of the Ten Isles, I have known the dusty world cannot be relied upon. For over a decade, I have devoted myself to earnest prayer—yet how can I steel my resolve without some sign? One day by the river, I saw you, a tortoise white as jade, and took you in as something extraordinary. Why did you suddenly ascend into the void and leave, only to return? You must be a tortoise of the immortals—you should come and go thus. If not, then depart forever and do not stay.” The tortoise immediately rose into the void again and vanished. Seven days later, it returned once more.

Yang grew deeply suspicious that it was a divine immortal in transformation. He led it to stroll along the riverbank, admiring the scenery. Suddenly, an old man rushed up and asked Yang, “That tortoise is one I lost—how did you come by it?” Yang replied, “Years ago, I found it by the waterside and took it in.” The old man said, “This tortoise can ride the void and wander, and it can dive into the water without getting wet. If a person mounts it, they may travel ten thousand *li* or enter the Four Seas.” He continued, “Since you have cared for it so long, I now give it to you. Try riding it, and you may roam the Eight Extremities in search of immortals.” Yang bowed in gratitude, and the old man suddenly vanished.

Yang tentatively placed one foot on the tortoise’s back, and it gradually grew until it was as large as an ox. Yang mounted it, and the tortoise bore him into the river. Yang saw the waters part before him, leaving him completely dry. For several days, he rode it—sometimes through water, sometimes through the air—traveling roughly ten thousand *li*. Fearing, Yang addressed the tortoise, “You must bear me home.” In an instant, he looked up and found himself back at his old retreat.

Realizing the tortoise was extraordinary, Yang mounted it and journeyed west. After several more days, he reached a mountain where jade forests and coral trees grew, and a jade pool shimmered. From the mountaintop, he heard singing. Unsure of what lay ahead, he addressed the tortoise and returned.

Later, Yang longed once more for the immortal realms. Mounting the tortoise, he set off eastward. In an instant, he arrived at a vast river, its expanse stretching boundless in every direction. At its center rose a mountain, its summit crowned with towers and pavilions piercing the clouds. Struck with fear, Yang dared not enter the water and instead beseeched the tortoise to return. The people of Shu found it strange that Yang would depart only to come back again. When some inquired, he replied, “I often go into the mountains to gather herbs.” When asked about the tortoise, he said, “This tortoise is a creature of long life. I once found it by the river and took it in to keep. Though its color is unusual, it has no other extraordinary qualities.” One night, a curious visitor stole the tortoise. Yang then wandered far away, and none knew where he went.

In Chang’an, a musician named Zheng Wen had a daughter who could speak from birth. By the age of seven, she possessed a dignified bearing and excelled at playing the *fangxiang*. Her family and kin called her the *Fangxiang* Girl. When the Noble Consort learned of her, she wished to take her into service. Her parents asked her about it, but the girl said, “Am I some palace servant? The Noble Consort and I are of the same rank—how could she treat me so?” That very night, she vanished. Her parents grieved deeply but had no means to search for her. Three years later, she returned home. Startled, her parents asked for an explanation, and she said, “I briefly visited the Upper Clarity Palace. People told me my parents wept without cease, longing for me, so I came back.” Her parents said, “If you are one of the immortals, why did you come to our home as our daughter?” The girl replied, “I am a *fangxiang* performer of the Upper Clarity. For secretly observing the mortal realm, I was punished. I cannot stay long in this world—do not grieve for me.” Her parents asked, “What joy is there in the immortal realms? Even in the mortal world, there is the pleasure of wealth and nobility. Why not stay here a while to comfort us?” The girl said, “What joy is there in the mortal world with its many sorrows? In the Upper Clarity, no worldly affairs burden me, no worldly cares trouble me. Beyond my duties in attendance, I ride the clouds and qi, mount simurghs and phoenixes to roam beyond the heavens. Sometimes I sip jade nectar, sometimes I visit Penglai or ascend Mount Tiantai, bow to Chang’e in the Lunar Palace, or play with the Weaving Maid by the Silver River. What joy does the mortal world hold? If you think wealth and nobility bring happiness, you do not understand—they only bring more trouble. Moreover, one moment you are born, the next you die.” Her parents pleaded, “Stay a while to comfort us. Do not speak of the differences between the mortal world and the heavens. Think of us, who gave you life.” The girl said, “If I stay, I will never return to the palaces of Upper Clarity.” As her parents wept, she suddenly vanished, and none knew where she went.

Guan Ge was a man of Zhao who, from youth, loved the Dao and did not tend to farming or labor. He often traveled between Zhao and Wei. By nature, he was neither humble nor respectful, yet he was sharp-tongued and quick-witted. One day while wandering, he chanced upon Master Zhang Guo. The master called out, “Come, Guan Ge.” Guan Ge asked, “Who are you?” Zhang Guo replied, “I am Master Zhang Guo.” Guan Ge said, “Why does Zhang Guo call me?” Zhang Guo said, “Do you not know mortal etiquette? Even mortal emperors show me respect—why do you not?” Guan Ge replied, “I am no mortal emperor, so why should I respect you?” Zhang Guo then invited him to travel together to Mount Heng, and Guan Ge followed. The master told Guan Ge to close his eyes. Guan Ge asked, “If closing my eyes allows us to travel, does not closing them mean we cannot?” Zhang Guo said, “It is because of your mortal body.” Guan Ge replied, “If your mortal body can go, why can’t I?” Zhang Guo tossed his staff, which transformed into a green ox, and bade Guan Ge ride it. Once mounted, Guan Ge entered Mount Heng with Zhang Guo. The master led him to the summit, sat down, and asked, “You have seen the mortal world’s clamor, the suffering of the dusty realm, the flourishing and withering of spring and autumn, the swift passage from youth to old age. Why, after wandering long in Zhao and Wei, do you not journey farther to the four extremes? Zhao and Wei are lands of warhorses—no place for a Daoist to wander. If you wish to cleanse your mind and dispel vexations, to first purify your form, then Zhao and Wei are not the place.” Guan Ge replied, “Why do *you* wander in Zhao and Wei? A true Daoist does not change with the land. My travels in Zhao and Wei are no different from my travels in Jade Clarity or Penglai. If you exalt emperors and belittle commoners, call me by name, and speak of imperial respect, then even if I were in Jade Clarity or Penglai by morning and in Zhao or Wei by evening, I would still be swayed by mortal sentiment. Why should I journey far? You should travel far to shed worldly affairs. If you do not, you will die in the mortal world and never be my equal.” Zhang Guo laughed but did not reply. Guan Ge continued, “Did you bring me to Mount Heng just to show me your staff turning into a green ox? Do you not know what things *cannot* be transformed? Transformations are not strange—even mortals who become immortals are found in every generation.” He rose abruptly, took leave of Zhang Guo, and descended the summit. There, he wove grass into a hut and dwelled in the mountains. Later, none knew his fate, though some claimed to have seen him on Mount Ji.

The Grass-Clad Child claimed to be a man of Lu. Handsome in appearance, he appeared to be fourteen or fifteen years old. Winter and summer alike, he wore only a cloak of grass, so people called him the Grass-Clad Child. For years, he fished by the Si River, though no one ever saw him catch a fish. This struck people as most unusual. Someone asked, “Can fish be eaten?” He replied, “I do not eat fish—I only fish.”

Others once asked his surname and given name, to which he replied, “From childhood, I never knew my father—much like Dongfang Shuo—so I cannot take a surname.” The people by the Si River secretly observed his behavior, and the Grass-Clad Child, sensing this, fled to the banks of the Han River, where he again cast his line. At first, people took him for a fisherman, but when they saw he never caught a fish, and that through scorching heat and bitter cold he wore only his single cloak of grass, unchanged for years, they grew deeply suspicious. Someone asked him, “What is your name? You’ve fished by the river for years, enduring every season in nothing but a grass cloak, yet never caught a fish—why?” The Grass-Clad Child said, “I am the Grass-Clad Child.” He added, “People call me the Grass-Clad Child. I come to fish, but fishing need not be for fish. Besides, I gain what I seek—how do you know I do not gain it? Since I am called Grass-Clad Brother, why should I need a name?”

The people by the Han River also watched him in secret, and the Grass-Clad Child, aware of this, fled once more to the Wei River to fish. Those by the water saw his handsome face and his single cloak of grass and took him for a recluse. Later, when they saw he never caught a fish, they grew doubtful. Someone asked, “What are you hiding from? Why have you come to the Wei River? Do you seek to follow in Lü Wang’s footsteps?” The Grass-Clad Child replied, “I love fishing by nature and have delighted in it since childhood. I have fished in many waters, but none were right for fishing, so I came here. People see me in my grass cloak and call me the Grass-Clad Child. Lü Wang, however, saw that the Shang king could not be admonished and wished to aid the Western Earl, so he came here to wait—not to fish. Now a wise ruler holds the realm, and there is no Western Earl to await, so why should I follow Lü Wang’s name?”

The questioner said, “If you do not await the Western Earl, whom do you await?” The Grass-Clad Child said, “I await a slab of stone.” The man laughed and asked no more. Days later, a white stone over a *zhang* long drifted down the Wei River. The Grass-Clad Child saw it, leapt for joy, and said to those by the water, “I never fished for fish—I waited to fish for this stone. For years, nothing could bear my body, but today it may bear me.” He climbed onto the stone, rode the current away, and none knew where he went.

Jushi Zhen maintained a villa at the foot of the Southern Mountains outside Chang’an. His household was exceedingly wealthy, with pines and cypresses casting deep shade, flowers and bamboo planted in profusion, a small bridge spanning a flowing stream, and a lofty pavilion whose eaves brushed the clouds upon the peaks. Zhen often wore a kudzu-fiber headscarf, light ramie robes, and carried a green bamboo staff, wandering freely on his own. Several embroidered-clad maidens accompanied him. When the mood struck, he would pour himself fragrant, rich wine and drink alone, so that few ever saw his face.

In Chang’an there was a young man named Zhao Ying, a free-spirited soul. Having heard of Zhen, he went to pay him a visit. When he knocked at the gate, a maidservant came out to receive him. Zhen, seeing Ying, asked, “Who are you, and why have you come so far to visit me?” Ying replied, “I love singing and delight in wine. I often lament that heaven and earth do not allow flowers to bloom eternally, and I fear that in this life there may be hidden vistas I shall never see. Beyond this, even high rank and sumptuous feasts hold no interest for me.” Zhen was pleased and invited him to a small terrace, where they drank together from golden goblets. He then said to Ying, “You are a man who seeks pleasure in wandering and revelry. You have seen much, but today I would like to show you something without the use of strings or pipes.” He ordered two maidservants to bring forth a pair of wooden phoenixes inlaid with pearls and kingfisher feathers, so lifelike they seemed alive. Then a maiden in a golden crown and gauze robes began to sing, and the phoenixes danced in perfect time—now gliding like wind, now whirling like snow. In a moment, the maiden’s song ended, and the phoenixes ceased their dance.

Zhen then sang himself:
*“How many days in this world till mulberry fields turn to sea?*
*Who knows the heavens hidden in the immortal’s cave?*
*Short and fleeting, all know the difference—*
*Then let us fearlessly drink while life remains.”*

Hearing this, Ying could not help but sigh deeply. Zhen then ordered a maidservant to take a pellet of elixir from a jade flask and bestow it upon Ying, saying, “Take this, and you may wander among men for two hundred years more.” Ying bowed in gratitude, took his leave, and returned home.

Later, when the imperial carriage was about to visit the Shu Mountains, Zhen’s household suddenly vanished. Ying, having consumed the elixir, indeed lived for over two hundred years.

Ding Huang often roamed Luoyang, calling himself a recluse of Mount Song. His hair was white as silk, yet his complexion was like the bloom of peach blossoms. Someone once asked him, “You must be a hundred years old—when did you withdraw to Mount Song?” Huang replied, “I was originally a scholar in the time of the First Emperor of Qin. When Li Si urged the emperor to bury the scholars and burn the books to keep the common people ignorant, I fled into Mount Song. There I met an old man who said to me, ‘I can grant you long life.’ He gave me a pellet of elixir, which I swallowed. To this day, though my hair is white, my appearance has not changed, so I no longer keep track of how many years have passed. I once knew Dongfang Shuo of the Han Emperor Wu’s time. Shuo was but a child among the immortals, wild and unruly in nature. The immortals disliked him and sent him into the mortal world. I have also paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, who spoke of him, so I sought out Shuo to ask. He only laughed and did not deny it. I have also known Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao. They were mere mortals who, by chance, entered the Peach Blossom Spring. Yet they still harbored worldly desires, so they could not attain immortality. Since then, many who pursued the Dao have ascended to heaven in broad daylight, never to return. I, however, was never truly an immortal, so I have met few of them.”

Another asked, “Since you obtained the divine elixir, why have you not become an immortal?” Huang replied, “Though I gained the Way of long life, I never mastered the art of riding the void and guiding the *qi*, so I cannot ascend as an immortal.” Every year, when spring brought warmth, Huang would come to Luoyang. He did so for several decades, and all in the city knew him. When An Lushan was about to raise his rebellion, Huang said to those around him, “I must flee the barbarians once more—unlike the scholars of old.” With that, he departed and never returned. People suspected he was but an earthbound immortal.

Jiang Cheng, of unknown origin, always carried a staff with a single scroll of scripture bound to its head. He sojourned in Chang’an for nearly a year, keeping company with frivolous men and calling himself one who had attained the Dao. Master Ye Jing learned of this and sought him out, demanding, “Why do you style yourself one who has attained the Dao? You neither purify your body nor refine your spirit, and yet you mingle with the impure—what is the meaning of this?”

Cheng replied, “My body is without filth—why should it be purified? My spirit is without disturbance—why should it be cleansed? If one has not attained the Dao, to claim it is wrong; if one has attained it, what is wrong with claiming it?”

Ye Jing asked, “What do you mean by ‘body without filth’? What do you mean by ‘spirit without disturbance’? What do you mean by ‘attaining the Dao’?”

Cheng said, “Carved jade is warm and lustrous by nature. Though it dwells among common stones, it remains unstained—how is this different from my body? The waters of the Ji River are clear by origin. Though they flow with turbid streams, they remain undisturbed—how is this different from my spirit? The Great Dao is fundamentally without deceit. Since I have attained the Dao, to speak of it is to express the Great Dao.”

Ye Jing pressed, “What do you mean by ‘expressing the Great Dao’?”

Cheng replied, “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The eternal Dao is the Great Dao. If I were to regard the noble as noble, the wealthy as wealthy, the base as base, and the poor as poor, that would not be the Dao. I know that men distinguish themselves in the world, but they do not recognize the root of the Dao. From the root of the Dao arises the One *qi*; from the One *qi* arise heaven, earth, man, and the myriad things. Now that the Three Powers are complete and the myriad things are manifest, all proceed from the Dao. I have grasped this, and so I mingle with the rich and noble without revering them, dwell among the impure without feeling debased, and simply abide in equanimity among men—how is this not ‘expressing’ it?”

Ye Jing laughed and said, “I thought you had lingered too long among men and could no longer discourse on the Dao. You should depart the dusty world—the dusty world does not depart you, but clings to your side.”

Cheng replied, “I left the dusty world not because of your words—I have already departed it for three hundred years.”

Ye Jing asked, “If you have left the dusty world, why are you still in it?”

Cheng said, “I am only temporarily here; it is not that I have not departed.”

Ye Jing bowed and turned to leave, but Cheng grasped his sleeve and said, “You are a friend of the present Son of Heaven, yet as his friend, you do not teach him the Way of ruling men. Instead, you entice him with the affairs of immortals, seeking to make him neglect governance in favor of Daoist arts—this is your error. Therefore, you cannot accuse me of error.”

Ye Jing laughed again and said, “Enough of your mad words.”

Cheng replied, “You should not believe the words of a madman—I should cease my mad words.” With that, both laughed and parted ways.

Several days later, Cheng vanished without a trace. Some claimed to have seen him riding a crane across the pass.

Shen Jing, a native of eastern Zhe, studied the Dao from childhood. Later, while wandering Mount Zhong, he encountered an old woman who said to him, “Your bones are refined, your spirit clear, and your heart upright. In ten years, you will attain the Dao—only cultivate and refine yourself.” She then gave him a piece of white stone, instructing, “Simply boil this stone in mountain spring water without ceasing the fire. When it softens like a medicinal paste, eat it. If it has not softened, do not stop the fire.” With that, the old woman disappeared.

Jing marveled at this and built a thatched hut in the mountains, drawing spring water to boil the stone. He kept the fire burning for ten years, yet the stone did not soften. At last, he ceased boiling it. One night, the old woman reappeared and asked, “I originally instructed you to boil this stone in mountain spring water—why have you stopped?”

Jing replied, “I followed your teaching and boiled this stone for ten years, yet it remains inedible.”

The old woman said, “This is no ordinary stone—it cannot be obtained lightly. Since you have received it, why not boil it with utmost sincerity and a mind free of doubt? Then it would soften in less than ten years. If belief and doubt arise in your heart, even after ten years of boiling, it will remain inedible.”

Jing asked, “What kind of stone is this? If it is not of the human world, it must naturally be extraordinary and edible. If it is extraordinary, why must it be boiled before it can be eaten?”

The old woman said, “This is the fruit of the *qiong* tree. I do not know who obtained it and left it on this mountain, where it was tainted by the noxious winds of the human world and hardened. If you boil it in mountain spring water with sincerity, it will soften. Once softened and eaten, you will attain the Dao.”

Jing bowed in gratitude, but the old woman vanished again. He then purified himself, drew mountain spring water, and boiled the stone. By the next day, it had softened, filling the mountain with a fragrant aroma. Jing bathed, ate the entire stone, and suddenly his complexion became youthful, his beard and hair black as lacquer, his heart clear, and his body light. The mountain dwellers were all astonished.

Several days later, he disappeared without a trace.

Xiao Yin was a man of Wu, of imposing and majestic bearing. He often wandered among the famous mountains of the world. From youth, he ate pine and parasol seeds, consumed raw wood, and avoided the company of worldly people, his nature solitary and aloof.

One day, while traveling in Mount Zhongnan, a young girl approached him and said, “I, too, am a student of the Dao. Today, I wish to ask you about matters within the Way. Would you clarify them for me?”

Yin replied, “What would you ask?”

The girl said, “I have heard that since ancient times, all those who cultivate the Dao speak of abandoning sensual pleasures, yet only Peng Zu expounded on the arts of yin-yang union. Which is right, and which is wrong?”

Yin said, “In my life, I have never engaged in conversation with a woman. Why do I now encounter this question from you?”

The girl replied, “Even Peng Zu, who attained the Dao, permitted the inquiries of the *cainü*. Why would you not allow my single question?”

Yin then said, “In the past, the Yellow Emperor sent the *cainü* to ask Peng Zu about the Dao of yin-yang union. Peng Zu’s response was not incorrect, for he knew the Yellow Emperor could not yet abandon sensual pleasures. Thus, he answered accordingly—though Peng Zu himself did not truly have nine wives. Since ancient times, those who study the Dao have never failed to say: ‘The superior man sleeps in a separate bed, the middling man under a separate cover. Even if one consumes a hundred packets of medicine, it is not as good as remaining alone.’ How, then, can Peng Zu’s single remark be trusted? Even the divine and sagely must await the perfect union of oneness to achieve resonance. How much more so for the Dao of immortals—can one seek it without first relinquishing worldly desires?”

The girl said, “Yet in ancient times, there were those whose entire families ascended to the azure heavens, and those who became immortals together with their wives. Did they, too, lack worldly desires?”

Yin replied, “Those were families of immortals who descended into the world and then returned to their immortal state—not immortals who cultivated for a hundred generations before ascending to heaven.”

The girl said, “I understand. As a woman, can I cultivate and attain the Dao?”

Yin said, “You may. Your body was born from the qi of yin and sustains itself by it. If you guard the Dao of yin without encroaching upon yang, you will naturally attain the Way.”

The girl thanked him and departed. Yin then left Mount Zhongnan and entered the mountains of Shu. The mountain dwellers, seeing his extraordinary bearing, often came to question him. Disliking this, he departed to wander afar, and his whereabouts were ultimately unknown.

Han Ye was a man who often traveled the world. He loved flowing water and always lingered by its banks. In the Qin Huai River, there was a fish about three feet long, its scales shimmering in five colors. It would often float upon the waves, vanishing at the sight of people.

When Ye arrived, someone by the water said to him, “There is a strange fish in these waters. Do you recognize it?”

Ye smiled and replied, “It is not a fish.”

In an instant, the creature surfaced upon the waves, its five colors resplendent. The person asked again, “If it is not a fish, what is it?”

Ye said, “This is the white dragon once ridden by Qin Gao. He has come to summon a friend.”

The person asked, “Who is Qin Gao?”

Ye replied, “Qin Gao was an immortal. In the past, he briefly appeared in the human world, sometimes riding this dragon through the waters. Fearing that mortals would be terrified at the sight of the dragon, he transformed it into a fish. Thus, the world came to believe Qin Gao rode a fish. I recognize it now.”

The person asked, “How do you know he has come to summon a friend?”

Ye said, “Qin Gao loved flowing water and often wandered within it. Now that this dragon has appeared upon the waves, it is clear he has come to summon a friend.”

Ye then entered the water, embraced the fish, and carried it ashore, covering it with woven grass. By nightfall, when people returned to observe, both Ye and the fish had vanished.

The Flute-Playing Maiden often wandered by the Han River. She was beautiful, about seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in emerald robes, and always carried a flute in her hands. At dawn or dusk, she would play it, her melodies deeply moving. She moored a small boat by the river, and if anyone approached, she would swiftly board it and depart. She had been by the Han River for years, sometimes leaving for a year before returning, or reappearing after a month. The people by the river called her the Flute-Playing Maiden.

At the beginning of the Tianbao era, Wang Yi, a dissolute young man from Chang’an, heard of her and traveled expressly to seek her out. Upon reaching the riverside, he saw no sign of her for days. Disappointed, he sighed, “In Chang’an, I heard of a divine maiden playing her flute by this river. I came from afar, hoping to glimpse her jade countenance and hear her phoenix-like music. Yet now the riverside is desolate, with no trace of her. Why does she not leave Penglai for a moment and come here?”

Just as he was about to leave in frustration, the maiden suddenly appeared, playing her flute as she approached in her small boat. She then disembarked and strolled by the water’s edge. Yi gradually drew near and said, “Divine maiden, you have wandered here for years. What have you been waiting for?”

The Flute-Playing Maiden turned to him, smiled faintly, and said, “I have been waiting for you.”

Yi said to her, “I have long been burdened by worries and dislike the company of others. I wished to wander beyond the mundane world, yet I did not know you had been waiting for me all these years.”

The maiden replied, “What is there to cherish in the human world? Before one’s youthful joys are exhausted, one is already old. And old age, too, has an end. How much better to dwell as an immortal in the secluded Penglai, within palaces of gold and silver, riding cranes and phoenixes for amusement, resting in fields of magic mushrooms, gathering by the Jasper Pool—forever ageless, without end. What worries could trouble such a life?”

Yi teased her, “Could you bear to have me as a servant to hold your flute?”

The Flute-Playing Maiden laughed and said, “You still do not realize you have been an old servant for many years.”

The Flute-Playing Maiden then bade Yi board a small skiff with her and depart. Several days later, she and Yi returned together to this waterside for another outing. Some bystanders witnessed them, and Yi said to them, “Convey this message to the young men of Chang’an: I have now been borne away by the Flute-Playing Maiden on distant travels and shall no longer wander in Chang’an.” With these words, he reentered the skiff with her, and they drifted away to the sound of her flute. Thereafter, they never returned, and none knew where they had gone.

Jing Zhong was a man of Zheng. From childhood, he was devoted to the Dao, roaming only among the mountains to gather and ingest medicinal herbs, never settling in one place. Later, passing through Shanzhou, he wished to journey westward in search of herbs. An old man in Shanzhou asked him, “Where are you bound?” Zhong replied, “I have always taken pleasure in consuming the herbs of immortals and have often wandered famous mountains to gather them. Now I intend to travel west in search of more.” The old man said, “Do you not know that the herbs of immortals lie in the Ten Isles, not within the mountains of the human world? Why seek them here?” Zhong replied, “The old man does not know that in ancient times there were those who attained the Dao by ingesting trees or yellow essence. Were trees and yellow essence gathered from the Ten Isles? Within the mountains of the human world, the herbs of immortals are without end—only men fail to recognize them and, moreover, cannot steadfastly consume them. Besides, how can the Ten Isles compare to the Central Realm? The Central Realm lies at the center of Heaven and Earth, possessing the balanced qi of their midst. Thus, its myriad things flourish, and its people are not barbarians. Those in the Central Realm who attain the Dao appear in every generation, whereas I have never heard of barbarians attaining the Dao in every generation. This is sufficient to know that the tales of the Ten Isles are but the wild fabrications of men in the time of Emperor Wu of Han. Why believe them? I swear to gather and consume herbs only within the mountains of the Central Realm.” He then set off westward in search of herbs.

Twenty years later, he passed through Shanzhou again. His temples were now streaked with white, yet he had not obtained any numinous herbs. Another old man asked him, and Zhong said, “When I passed through here on my westward journey before, an old man questioned me about gathering herbs. Now another old man wishes to question me?” The old man replied, “The former old man asked about your herbs; this old man wishes to ask about your temples streaked with white. What is strange about that?” Zhong said, “From childhood, I have been devoted to the Dao, living among men in Heaven and Earth for forty-nine years. Searching mountains and seeking herbs, my strength is exhausted and my heart weary. I have not transcended the human world, and so my temples are streaked with white. Why do you ask?” He then turned away and continued eastward, entering Mount Qin, where he consumed *fuling* for over a decade without emerging. One night, his temples suddenly turned black again, and his body became unusually light. He then left the mountain and traveled west, arriving in Shanzhou in a single day without realizing it. There, he sought out the two old men but found them by chance. Each old man smiled and said, “The old man who sought herbs has grown young again.” Before Zhong could speak, the two old men vanished. Zhong then wandered far away, and none knew where he had gone.

He Ning was the son of a wealthy family from Western Shu. From youth, he was fond of the Dao and, abandoning his home, traveled far to Mount Tiantai to study it for over a decade before returning. His family asked, “Have you learned the Dao? Why have you returned?” Ning replied, “Since entering Mount Tiantai, I have awakened to the Dao. Thus, I did not learn it but attained it.” His family said, “Can the Dao be awakened to?” Ning replied, “The Dao cannot be learned. Now I understand this. The Dao lies only in awakening. Now I, too, understand it. The Dao is originally within human nature. If one’s nature contains the Dao, one will ultimately attain it. If one’s nature lacks the Dao, one will never attain it. My nature contains the Dao, so I have naturally attained it.”

Having returned home, he ate only fresh fruit and drank wine. Later, whenever the leaves fell, the frontier crows arrived, and the wind mourned as the sun grew bleak, he would sigh, "People must have such moments to grieve the sorrowful." Then he would take up his staff and depart.

When spring arrived with its harmonious scenes—red blossoms and green leaves piled thick in forests and thickets—he would return again. Later, when a neighbor died and he heard the mournful wailing, he asked his family about it. They explained the situation. He rose at once, took a medicine pouch from the end of his staff, and drew out a cinnabar pill. Urging his family to place it in the mouth of the deceased, the neighbor, upon receiving the pill, soon revived.

He then took leave of his family, saying, "I now return to Mount Tiantai and will not come back. Each of you must take care of yourselves." He also distributed medicine from his pouch to his family, telling them, "This may grant you a hundred years." After departing, some saw him in the wilds, riding away on a tiger. Indeed, he never returned. Those who had received his medicine all lived to be a hundred years old.

Yao Ji was a man of Wei, dissolute and unrestrained by nature. In his youth, he was fond of the Dao and traveled to Dongting Lake, where he encountered a Daoist. The Daoist said to him, "You are dissolute and unrestrained, lacking self-discipline, yet you also pursue the Way of immortals. Why is this?" Ji bowed and replied, "My body delights in luxury and indulgence, but my heart seeks the Dao. I will forever pursue worldly pleasures to gladden my body, yet also seek the Way of immortals to fulfill my heart." The Daoist said, "I shall now grant you both. You must never pass them on to others." Ji bowed again. The Daoist then drew a small jade box from his sleeve, containing a single scroll, and handed it to Ji, saying, "Read this, and you will master all within."

Ji knelt to receive and read it, discovering the method for the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir, as well as the art of transmuting base metals into gold. He asked the Daoist, "That consuming the divine elixir grants transcendence, I believe. But can copper and iron truly be turned to gold?" The Daoist replied, "Copper and iron may become gold, just as the worthy and the unworthy may both attain immortality—how much more so for copper and iron, which are pure and uniform substances? Simply refine the elixir, consume it, and transmute the metals." Ji then returned to Wei to reside there, refining elixirs and transmuting gold. Within a few years, his household grew immensely wealthy, and he reversed aging to regain his youth.

Whenever flowers bloomed or moonlight shone, he would prepare fine wine and delicacies, summoning guests and entertainers to sing wildly and dance in drunkenness. At times, he would seek out secluded vistas for outings, riding a team of four fine horses, with female musicians and their stringed instruments following behind, returning only when his joy was complete. Even his household enjoyed light, warm clothing and grew weary of the hundred flavors.

Later, while out on another excursion, he unexpectedly encountered the Daoist from Dongting Lake. Ji hurriedly bowed and asked, "Why has my master not come for so long?" The Daoist replied, "Your indulgence has not ceased, so I have not come. Passing by today, I happened to grow hungry for the sight of you." Ji said, "If my indulgence has not ceased, it is because my master has not come." The Daoist said, "Now it must cease." Ji laughed and accompanied the Daoist back to his home, where he lavishly displayed brocades and silks, brought forth treasures, ordered wine, and arranged for music, drinking to their hearts' content.

The next day, neither the Daoist nor Ji could be found. His household had no means to search for them.
