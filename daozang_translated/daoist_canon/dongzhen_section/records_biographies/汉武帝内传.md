*The Inner Transmission of Emperor Wu of Han*
*Text Title: The Inner Transmission of Emperor Wu of Han*
*One fascicle. Base text from:* The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, "Records and Biographies" section of the* Dongzhen *department. Collated with:* Shoushan'ge Congshu *edition (annotated by Qian Xizuo) and the* Siku Quanshu *edition.*

Emperor Xiaowu was fond of the arts of longevity and frequently offered sacrifices at famous mountains and great marshes in search of divine immortals. In the first year of the Yuanfeng reign, on the jiazi day, he sacrificed at Mount Song, establishing a divine palace. The Emperor fasted for seven days, and upon completing the rites, he returned.

On the wuchen day of the fourth month, as the Emperor leisurely resided in the Chenghua Palace at night, Dongfang Shuo and Dong Zhongshu attended him. Suddenly, a woman appeared, dressed in azure robes, of extraordinary beauty. Startled, the Emperor asked her who she was. The woman replied, "I am Wang Zideng, the Jade Maiden of the Tang Palace, sent by the Queen Mother of the West from Kun Mountain." (Kun Mountain is Kunlun Mountain.) She said to the Emperor, "I have heard that you, though revered across the Four Seas, seek the Dao and long for life, descending from the throne of emperors to repeatedly pray at mountains and peaks. How diligent! You seem one who may be taught. From now, purify and fast for a hundred days, abstaining from worldly affairs. Do not govern. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother will briefly visit."

The Emperor descended from his seat and knelt in assent. As soon as she finished speaking, the woman suddenly vanished. The Emperor asked Dongfang Shuo, "Who was this?" Shuo replied, "She is a Jade Maiden of the Purple Orchid Chamber of the Queen Mother of the West, who often conveys decrees, traveling to Fusang, entering Lingzhou, passing through Changyang, and transmitting messages to the Mystic Capital. The Queen Mother was once betrothed to the Immortal of the Northern Candle, but was recently recalled to oversee decrees and records—a true divine official."

Thereupon, the Emperor ascended the Terrace of Extending Spirits, devoting himself to fasting and cultivating the Dao, entrusting the affairs of the four directions to his chief minister. By the seventh day of the seventh month, he had cleansed the inner palace, prepared a seat in the hall, spread purple silk upon the ground, burned incense of a hundred harmonies, hung cloud-patterned brocade curtains, lit lamps of ninefold radiance, set out jujubes from the Jade Gate, poured grape wine, and personally oversaw the dishes, preparing a celestial feast.

The Emperor, clad in his finest robes, stood below the steps, commanding that no one within the main gate dare to peek. Inside and out, all was silent and solemn as they awaited the cloud-borne carriage. After the second watch, suddenly the southwest sky stirred as if white clouds arose, swelling and approaching directly toward the palace. In an instant, it drew near, and from within the clouds came the sounds of flutes and drums, the clamor of men and horses. After half a meal’s time, the Queen Mother arrived. Her descent before the hall resembled a flock of crows alighting. Some rode dragons and tigers, others a single *jie* astride lions, or mounted white tigers, or rode white *lin* unicorns, or guided white cranes, or drove *ke* carriages. Tens of thousands of immortals illuminated the courtyard with their brilliance.

Once they arrived, her attendants could no longer be seen; only the Queen Mother remained, seated in a *jie* carriage of purple clouds, drawn by nine multicolored striped dragons. Beside her were fifty celestial immortals, each a *zhang* tall, all bearing feathered staves and wearing golden adamantine sashes, girded with celestial tallies. They all halted before the hall, while the Queen Mother, supported by two handmaidens, ascended the steps.

The handmaidens appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years old, dressed in azure silk robes with trailing sashes. Their eyes sparkled with radiant glances, their bearing elegant and luminous—true beauties. The Queen Mother, facing east, took her seat. She wore a yellow brocade robe with a high collar and wide sleeves, its embroidery resplendent, her demeanor serene and majestic. A great sash of *lingfei* hung from her waist, and she bore the Sword of Parting the Head. Upon her head was a grand floral knot, crowned with the *Tai Zhen Chen Ying* coronet. Her shoes were black, embroidered with phoenix patterns. Though she appeared to be thirty, her stature was perfectly proportioned, her celestial grace misty and ethereal, her countenance unmatched in the world—a true divine being.

As she alighted from her carriage and ascended the steps, the Emperor bowed and knelt, inquiring after her well-being. Once finished, he stood as before. She then summoned the Emperor to sit beside her. The Emperor faced south toward the Queen Mother.

The Queen Mother personally arranged the feast, which was of extraordinary refinement: sumptuous delicacies, fragrant fruits of a hundred kinds, purple mushrooms in rich broth, and dishes so abundant they seemed to fill the hall. The wine was of celestial fragrance, unlike anything on earth, its sweet aroma unparalleled. The Emperor could not name it. She then commanded her handmaidens to fetch peaches. In a moment, they presented seven peaches in a *luan* vessel, each as large as a duck’s egg, round and green in hue. The Queen Mother offered four to the Emperor and ate three herself. The peaches were so sweet and delicious that their flavor lingered in the mouth.

The Emperor ate them and kept the pits. (Keeping, that is, preserving them.) The Queen Mother asked, "Why?" The Emperor replied, "I wish to plant them." The Queen Mother said, "These peaches bear fruit but once every three thousand years. The soil of the Central Land is too poor; they will not grow. How can this be?" The Emperor then desisted.

As the wine cups passed several times around the gathering, the Queen Mother then commanded her handmaiden Wang Zideng to pluck the *balang* zither, and her handmaiden Dong Shuangcheng to play the *yunsu* reed pipe. She further ordered her handmaiden Shi Gongzi to strike the bronze bells of Kunting, her handmaiden Xu Feiqiong to sound the *zhenling* reed organ, and her handmaiden Ruan Linghua to arrange the five *ling* stones—*cun* here meaning "to arrange," and the stones resembling jade chimes. Her handmaiden Fan Chengjun was bidden to strike the *qing* of Dongting, while her handmaiden Duan Anxiang performed the *jiutian* zither. Thus, the myriad sounds rang clear and resonant, their divine music startling the heavens.

Then the Queen Mother commanded her handmaiden An Faying to sing the *Xuanling* hymn, its lyrics as follows:

*"Though the Great Image be vast and boundless,
I hold the gate of heaven and earth.
Parting the clouds, I descend in my spirit chariot,
Swiftly arriving in the lower realm.
The void forms a mysterious sound,
The utmost spirit brooks no refinement.
The Supreme Perfected exhales a chant,
Only then do I know the bitterness of the dusty world.
Nurture the spirit in the Three Fields,
Absorb essence beneath the Six Palaces.
Then ride the myriad dragons’ posts,
Galloping through the nine wilds."*

The second verse:

*"The Dark Garden halts at the Northern Terrace,
The Five Cities stand towering.
I open the boundless ford,
Crossing the Weaving Maid’s River.
Above, I ascend the crimson court,
Below, I wander the moon’s hidden vale.
Gazing beyond the eight wastes,
I beckon the nine clouds afar.
Suddenly, weariness is unfelt,
How could I reckon little or much?
I command the assembled maidens,
Singing to stir harmonious resonance.
Exquisite joy flows naturally,
Thus I sing this hymn of the dark clouds.
The music fades, yet the melody lingers,
The true sound is free of all impurity."*

When the song ended, the Emperor descended from his seat and kowtowed, declaring: "I, Liu Che, unworthy and untalented, have long been mired in the mundane world. Inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I am shackled by worldly burdens. My governance is flawed, the people disunited; wind and rain fall unseasonably, the five grains bear no fruit. Virtue and grace remain unestablished, bandits plague the four seas, the black-haired people toil to exhaustion, and households have dwindled by half. As an unfit ruler, my failures mount like mountains. Yet from youth I have loved the Dao, yearning for the immortals. I could not abandon rank and renown to dwell in the mountains and forests, nor sever worldly attachments to know where to turn. Forsaking the world to seek truth, I drilled and probed without a teacher. The years and months have worn on, and I fear my time is fleeting. Never did I imagine that today your celestial countenance would descend, granting this humble servant the fortune to behold your sacred presence. This must be my destined fate to attain transcendence. I beg your compassion, that you bestow upon me what I have failed to comprehend, and allow me to receive your personal teachings."

The Queen Mother replied: "You—hereafter the same—have scorned glory and pleasure, delighting in emptiness and savoring the Dao; this is indeed excellent. Yet you indulge your desires, your excesses and licentiousness run rampant, your killings are unlawful, and your nature is steeped in extravagance. Indulgence is the chariot that rends the body, lust the axe that shatters the years. Killing invites retribution, extravagance rots the heart, desire topples the spirit, and filth severs fate. With a body as fragile as yours, housing a ruined form, a mere foot of timber assailed by a hundred *ren* of harm—how can you hope to shed the Three Corpses, preserve your body, and endure forever? It is like a wingless heron longing to flap its wings over the celestial pond, or a mayfly wishing to enjoy the spring and autumn. If you could sweep away these myriad disorders, purge filth and restore harmony, guard your spirit’s darkness in the Crimson Palace, close the gates of excess and open the gates of enlightenment, still the extravagance in the chamber of stillness, cherish all beings without endangering them, uphold these precepts of the Dao, contemplate its numinous essence, practice kindness and harmony, refine and treasure your essence and *qi*, cast aside frivolous adornments, and let the hundred strivings swiftly recede—then perhaps you might glimpse the path. If not, it would be as futile as embracing a stone to cross a great river."

The Emperor knelt to receive the sacred precepts, vowing to heed her words. "The essentials of nurturing life I have now heard, yet my body is not of jade or stone, and my *qi* has no master within. My darkness is not of the four seasons, yet it constantly arises within. In governing, I must regulate my comings and goings, ensuring that breath is harmonious and fluids flow smoothly, that form and spirit are not disordered, and that *qi* adapts as needed. Then the hun and po will not stagnate. If I can align with my allotted portion, discerning the proper measure of *qi* and its movements, then my form may not wither, and my dwelling may not decay. Though I once received the scriptures of the Dao and diligently practiced them, I gained no true verification, no great benefit. My spirit is wearied by its comings and goings, my fluids labored by their egress and ingress. The years diminish their beginning, the months wane their past; my form gradually withers, my spirit declines. This is because I have failed to uphold the oral instructions, opening and closing the Gate of Brilliance as required. I do not know whether the arts of ingestion can ensure permanence, or whether breath control can extend the years. I beg you to bestow the art of longevity, that I may briefly awaken this walking corpse. If you would deign to instruct me today, I prostrate myself to receive the teachings of the resplendent heavens."

The Queen Mother said: "Long ago, when the Primordial Heavenly King of the Origin was at leisure, he ascended the Terrace of Nieshao. His attendants—the Heavenly Emperor of Fusang, the Nine Perfected Lords, the myriad immortals and officials of the ten directions—gathered within the cinnabar chamber to hear his profound words. He asked me why I sought to attain long life. I withdrew from my seat, kowtowed, and begged to learn the art of longevity. The Heavenly King, in his wisdom, bestowed upon me essential words—utterances profound and subtle, truly the mysterious vision of heaven and humanity, the wondrous secrets of the Supreme Emperor. Would you now wish to hear them?"

The Emperor knelt and said: "I, Liu Che, a lowly and worthless creature, a remnant of withered bones, dare to aspire with my unworthy body to the years of dragons and phoenixes, hoping with the ephemeral quality of morning flowers to attain the span of dark and bright moons. Though I long for distant currents, I know not how to cross. The path is blocked and impassable, my needs unmet. I constantly fear that one day I will die in the struggle of seeking, becoming a laughingstock to the vulgar. Never did I imagine that today I would encounter this luminous convergence, gazing upon your sacred form, my spirit soaring as if awakened from a great dream."

"Should you traverse the world for a thousand years, to rescue and safeguard the day of death’s return—then I humbly beg your compassionate instruction, that you bestow upon me the primal essence."

The Queen Mother said: "I shall now impart to you the essential teachings. I once heard the Heavenly King say: Those who seek long life must first seek it within themselves. Simply guard firmly the Three Ones and preserve your traveling clan. There are the golden radiance enfolding herbs, the yellow woods of Broad Mountain, the jade medicines of Prosperous City, the fire-jade of Night Mountain, the singing wine of Phoenix Grove, the jade wine of Western Jade, the purple honey of the Central Lands, the green mounds of Northern Tumulus, the supreme medicines of the Most High—phoenix fruits and cloud seeds, jade nectar and golden liquor, moon essence of ten thousand years, azure-sea coral greens, the patterned herbs of Penglai, the seven blossoms of Turbid River, the tall willows of Moving Mountain, the brocade flowers plucked from Dark Capital’s heights, the crimson honey sipped from Cloud Mountain’s peaks, the heavenly bones of Night River, the lacquer foam of Kunwu, the single spirit melon of the empty cavern, the fruit that ripens once in four kalpas, the unicorn gall of Proper Mound, the sun of Flame Mountain that rises in a single night, the cinnabar archives of Fusang’s east, the patterned algae dredged from the Long River’s depths. There are the white-violet lads, the nine-colored phoenix brains, the rainbow sprouts of the Great Perfected, the giant grasses of Heavenly Desert, the fire-jades of Southern Palace, the elder-supporting herbs of Western Land, the three-beamed dragon flowers, the birth herbs of the Great Dao—whoever partakes of these will age only after heaven itself. These are what the Most High consume; they are not what middling immortals preserve.

Next in rank are the medicines: the Eight Radiant Supreme Harmony, the spotted dragon’s black embryo, the striped tiger’s white foam from Western Mound, the seven dark flying nodes, the nine-holed linked pearls, cloud nectar and jade wine, the fat of Jade Garden, the white glue of Bell Mountain, the azure of Jade Chamber, the stone marrow of Boudoir Wind, the black river’s coral, the white phoenix of Meng Mountain, the blood of the azure simurgh of Spirit Mound, the crimson herbs of Eastern Ying, the nine-jointed intertwined stalks, the fine grains of Supreme Microcosm, the brain-fruits of Jade Flower, the whale eyes of Flowing Abyss, the crimson jades of Red River, the fermented milk drawn from the Great Mystery’s north, the pulses grasped from the Two Modes’ center, the cloud-stream mugwort, the divine birds of Kun Hill, the stem herbs of Broad Night, the green teals of Flowing Abyss, the thunder essence of True Mound, the level canopy of Dark Capital, consuming the divine origin on the left, hearing the dark torrent on the right, bending to gather the golden essence of Orchid Garden above, stooping to pluck the purple crabapples of Round Mound below, the spirit clams of Luan Waters, the red Yueh of Eight Gorges—whoever partakes of these will depart only after heaven itself. These are what the Heavenly Emperor consumes; they are what lesser immortals may attain.

Next are the medicines: the nine elixirs and golden liquor, the purple flowers and crimson blossoms, the nine transformations of Great Clarity, the nectar of five clouds, the dark frost and crimson snow, the leaping three yellows, the white incense of Eastern Sea, the flying life of Flame Continent, the eight stones and ten sprouts, the nine radiant perfected forms, the stone gall of Western Flow, the green coins of Eastern Sea, the surplus grains of High Mound, the essence stones of Jade Field, the returning elixir of Great Void, the golden orchids of Shengci, the ever-bright green herbs, the flying stalks of Cloud Lad—whoever consumes these will ascend to heaven in broad daylight. These are what flying immortals consume; they are what earthbound immortals may witness.

Below these are the medicines: the pines and cypresses’ resin, the essence of mountain ginger, the marsh plants and alisma, the wolfberries and poria, the calamus and asparagus, the sesame and astragalus, the flying red tablets of lepidium, the peach gum and vermilion blossoms, the pepper and hemp, the dipsacus and polygonatum, the polygonum and coptis—such lesser medicines, though I mention but a few, number in the thousands. Whoever consumes these may extend their years. Though they may not enjoy boundless longevity or ascend to the azure heavens, they can still restore their bodies’ luster, return their hair to youthful black, command plant spirits, and become earthbound immortals. The key is to record these in order, gradually seeking what is ever more excellent.

Thus the heavens’ offices are profoundly wondrous, and the numinous medicines are of distinct ranks. The divine is not singularly extraordinary, and true immortals have their domains. Now, one cannot simply claim that breathing the six blacks and securing them within the body, irrigating the three palaces and drawing near to the courtyard of the self, are shallow arts to be discarded and left unpracticed—this would be the greatest folly.

To master breath and govern essence, to preserve the luminous spirit and the black, is sufficient to ensure that when essence does not dissipate, one endures forever, and when the black remains eternal, one does not die. Having attained harmony, one’s life knows no end. Moreover, this requires neither the expense of medicines nor the toil of seeking them. It is what the people use daily, and thus the highest grade is called the natural.

Yet one may not roam the ten heavens or soar beyond the eight directions, but may freely wander within the four realms, and even there, command the multitude of spirits. For those who first wish to cultivate this, begin by nurturing the black—this is what the *True Scripture of the Most High* calls the Way of Benefit and Transformation. Benefit refers to augmenting essence; transformation refers to transforming form. Those who can augment and transform are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals. Those who cannot augment nor transform cannot escape the calamity of death.

To practice augmentation and transformation means to constantly contemplate the numinous treasure. The numinous is spirit; the treasure is essence. You need only receive essence, grasp it firmly, close the black, and swallow the fluid. The black transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into fluid, fluid into bone. Practice this without weariness, and spirit and essence will overflow. In one year, the black is transformed; in two years, the blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form is transformed and changed. When the form is transformed and changed, the Dao is achieved, and upon achieving the Dao, one is ranked among the immortals.

Exhaling and inhaling the six blacks, the mouth becomes sweetly fragrant. Desiring to taste the numinous sprouts, one may savor their flavor. With subtle breaths and embracing swallows, follow the heart’s inclination. The black is water—nothing it cannot accomplish. As the most yielding of substances, it conveys the divine essence.

These are the esoteric words spoken by the Primordial Heavenly King within the cinnabar chamber. Now, I command the jade maiden Li Qingsun to transcribe and deliver them to you. Record them well and follow them diligently."

With these words roughly concluded, the Queen Mother whistled to summon the spirit officials, ordering them to harness the dragon-drawn carriage, preparing to depart.

The Emperor kowtowed, entreating her earnestly to stay, and the Queen Mother relented.

The Queen Mother then dispatched her attendant, Guo Mixiang, to convey greetings to the Supreme Primordial Lady, saying: "The Mother of the Nine Lights respectfully inquires after you. It has been over four thousand years since we last met. Heavenly affairs have wearied me, leaving my countenance wanting. Liu Che is devoted to the Dao, and I have come to observe him. I see that he is clear-minded and may yet progress. Yet his form is sluggish, his spirit defiled; his brain blood leaks wantonly, his five viscera impure. His stomach and intestines churn, his bones lack vital fluids, his qi drifts between inner and outer, his essence scant and jing abundant. His pupils are uneven, the Three Corpses stir in chaos, and his black and white hairs come untimely. To speak to him of the utmost Dao—I fear he may not be fit for immortality. Though I have long dwelled among mortals, I still find the stench and filth unbearable. Yet at times, I may still wander, hoping to dispel these petty concerns. The mediocre lord sits opposite, sullen and displeased. Would you deign to come for a brief visit? If you could condescend to descend, I shall wait for you."

The Emperor did not know who the Supreme Primordial Lady was, and as he watched the attendant descend from the hall, she suddenly vanished from sight. After a moment, Guo the attendant returned. The Supreme Primordial Lady had sent her own attendant in reply, saying: "Ahuan bows twice and inquires after your well-being. Separated by the Crimson River and burdened by official duties, my countenance has faded for nearly five thousand years. I long for your radiance and grace, my heart ever bound to you without fail. When Mixiang arrived bearing your message, I learned of your condescension to visit Liu Che. Upon hearing this, I was overcome with joy. Yet just before, the Great Emperor Lord dispatched me to the Dark Continent to review and rectify the Heavenly Records. I must depart briefly, but I shall return. Upon my return, I shall don my sash and stay for a short while."

The Emperor then asked about the Supreme Primordial Lady’s origins. The Queen Mother replied: "She is the overseer of the Supreme Primordial Palace of the Three Heavens, the one who governs the registers of jade maidens across the ten directions."

Shortly after, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived. As she approached, the sound of flutes and drums echoed through the clouds. Upon her arrival, her retinue of over a thousand civil and martial officials—all women—appeared. They were around eighteen or nineteen years of age, their forms luminous and graceful, most clad in azure robes. Their radiance outshone the sun, for they were true divine officials. The Lady herself appeared to be in her twenties, her celestial bearing resplendent, her eyes surpassingly bright. She wore a robe of crimson frost, its hues shifting in dazzling patterns—neither brocade nor embroidery, beyond any name. Her hair was styled into a three-cornered topknot, the rest cascading down to her waist. She wore a crown of Nine Spirits’ Night Radiance, a girdle of Six-Rayed Fire Jade, a sash of phoenix-patterned lin-hua, a sword of flowing yellow essence at her waist. She ascended the hall and bowed to the Queen Mother, who sat and gestured for her to stop, inviting her to sit facing north.

The Lady prepared a feast, its delicacies as refined as those the Queen Mother had set before them. The Queen Mother urged the Emperor, saying: "This is the True Primordial Mother, a most revered deity. You should rise and bow to her." The Emperor exchanged courtesies and returned to his seat.

The Lady smiled and said: "The people of this turbid world are mired in glory and profit, addicted to flavors and lusts—such is their nature. Moreover, Che, as a Son of Heaven, is twice as prone to distraction as ordinary men. Yet here he stands in this realm of splendor, having uprooted the roots of desire—this is no small feat. He truly has resolve."

The Queen Mother said: "Indeed, he has the heart for it."

The Supreme Primordial Lady then asked the Emperor: "Do you love the Dao? I hear you have frequently summoned masters of the esoteric arts, made offerings to mountains and rivers, and supplicated the numinous spirits. You have been diligent. Yet your efforts have borne no fruit—there is a reason for this."

"Your inborn nature is violent, your inborn nature is extravagant, your inborn nature is lustful, your inborn nature is cruel, your inborn nature is treacherous—these five ever dwell within the channels of *ying* and *wei* and the five viscera. Though sharp blades and fine needles be applied, they are fundamentally difficult to cure.

Violence drives the *shen* to flee in terror, so the spirit is disturbed and the *shen* exhausted. Lust causes essence to leak and the *hun* to weary, so essence is drained and the *hun* dissolved. Extravagance severs the true and scatters the *po*, so the root wanders and the numinous fades. Cruelty forfeits benevolence and turns against oneself, so one loses benevolence and submits to chaos. Treachery makes the heart a battleground and the mouth parched, so inner strife rages and outer ties are severed. These five are the saws and knives that sever the body, the axes and blades that cleave life. Though you may exhaust yourself in pursuit of longevity, if you cannot cast off these five afflictions, why harm your nature and weary yourself in vain?

Yet even this small benefit is enough to awaken you to the path ahead. If from this day forward you abandon these five natures, return to gentleness and goodness, clarify your duties and examine those below, show compassion to the aggrieved, bestow kindness to the poor, relieve the toiling, remember the orphaned, cherish your own body, and constantly perform hidden virtues to rescue those in mortal peril—if you persist in diligence without ceasing, refrain from leaking essence, seal off lust, nurture your spirit, cast off extravagance, embrace utmost frugality, devote yourself to fasting and abstinence, moderate your diet, abstain from the five grains, eliminate rich and rank foods, sound the Heavenly Drum, drink the Jade Nectar, bathe in the Flowery Pool, strike the Golden Bridge, and practice these disciplines—then wings shall grow.

Now the Most Venerable Mother has descended from the weight of Heavenly Honor, condescending to this mole-cricket’s burrow, bending the numinous emptiness to attend this solitary crow’s altar. Moreover, the Most Venerable Mother’s solemn admonitions, her wondrous teachings of the mysterious, test your reverence and diligence, and her measured instructions are clearly set forth. If your devotion endures for a hundred years, the Most Venerable Mother will surely guide you to the precincts of the Dark Capital, welcome you within the gates of Kunlun, appoint you to the offices of immortality, and enable you to roam the ten directions.

My words are finished. Steel yourself! If you cannot do this, there is nothing more to say."

The Emperor descended from his seat and knelt in gratitude, saying: "This servant’s nature is fierce and stubborn, born and raised in chaos and filth. Facing a wall, I have never known enlightenment, nor found a way to break through. Yet I cling to life and fear death, revering the numinous and honoring the gods. Today, I receive your teachings—this is the work of Heaven. I shall humbly embrace your sacred command as the model for my conduct. Though this lowly and contemptible servant, I may yet attain life. I beg only for your compassion and protection, that you grant me the very breath of existence."

The Lady then bade the Emperor return to his seat. The Queen Mother of the West addressed the Lady, saying: "Your admonitions were most urgent and severe, which may cause those yet unenlightened to shrink from their profound intent."

The Lady replied: "If one is truly resolved upon the Dao, they would cast their body before a starving tiger, forgetting themselves to the point of destruction. They would tread through fire and water, steadfast in their resolve, without fear. But if their loyalty and will are lacking, their heart will waver between truth and doubt, and such a hesitant, deluded soul will not be deterred by stern words. The urgency of my speech is meant only to strengthen their resolve. Since the Most Venerable Mother has taken this to heart, she will surely bestow upon them the method of *shijie*."

The Queen Mother said: "This one has long been diligent in heart, yet has never encountered a true teacher, nearly causing him to abandon his rightful aspiration. He came to doubt whether immortals exist in this world. Thus, I revealed my celestial palace and briefly withdrew him from the dust and filth, both to fortify his resolve for immortality and to ensure his faith in the Way remains unshaken. Today’s meeting moves me deeply. As for the *shijie* method of the lower ranks, I do not begrudge it in the least."

Three years hence, I shall bestow upon him half a dose of the elixir of perfection and a single *Stone Elephant Powder*—then he may no longer tarry here. Yet now the Xiongnu remain unquelled, and the frontier is unsettled; why should he hastily abandon the exalted station of the world to retreat into the mountain forests? First, let us inquire into the steadfastness of his aspiration. Should he waver or turn back, I shall come no more."

The Queen Mother then laid her hand upon the Emperor’s back and said: "You have heard the profound words of the Lady of Supreme Prime—surely you shall attain long life. How can you not strive with all your might?"

The Emperor knelt and replied: "I shall inscribe these words upon golden tablets and take them as my own model."

He then noticed within the Queen Mother’s headscarf a small scroll, encased in a purple brocade pouch. He asked: "Is this a divine formula of the immortals? Might I be permitted to glimpse its title?"

The Queen Mother produced it and showed him, saying: "This is the *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortals of Qingcheng sought it from me, and I was to deliver it to them. It was issued by the Supreme One of the Three Heavens, and its secrecy and prohibitions are most stringent—how could one of your impure constitution be fit to bear it? For now, I shall give you the *Scripture of the Radiant Life*, which may open the way to communion with the spirits and strengthen your resolve."

The Emperor prostrated himself upon the ground and entreated her without cease. The Queen Mother said: "In the first year of the *Qingxu* reign of the Supreme August One, the Most High Lord of the Dao descended to survey the six directions. He beheld the length and breadth of rivers and seas, examined the heights and depths of hills and mountains, established the Pillar of Heaven, and fixed it in the earth’s pattern. He planted the Five Peaks as the supporting pillars of the realm, honored Kunlun as the abode of divine immortals, exalted Penglai as the lodge of perfected beings, settled the water spirits at the source of utmost yin, and enthroned the Great Emperor at the site of Fusang. Thus, the mound of Fangzhang became the chamber of destiny, the islands of Canglang became the hall of the Nine Elders, while Zuying, Xuanming, Changyuan, Liusheng, Fenglin, and Juqu were each named as isles, all lying amidst the vast expanse of the dark tides and the profound ford. Their waters flow both azure and black, their waves surge with the essence of the sun and moon. Immortal maidens and jade lads gather there in countless numbers, their names unfathomable, yet their reality distinct.

Observing the contours of mountain origins and the meanders of rivers and peaks—how the ridges coil and the mounds turn, how the mountains rise high and stretch long, winding and undulating like written characters—he therefore shaped their forms into names, designating their true appellations. He drew their images in secret upon the Dark Terrace, and from there they emerged as tokens of the numinous and true. All immortals who bear them do so as one would transmit a sacred text. When Daoists carry them while traversing mountains and rivers, the hundred spirits and myriad numina honor them and come forth to welcome them.

Though you are not yet perfected, your repeated visits to mountains and marshes, your unwavering resolve to seek and inquire, have not forgotten the Way. Delighted by your sincerity, I now grant this to you. You must hold it in the deepest reverence, as though serving a lord or father."

Revealing these to the common and uninitiated will surely invite calamity. The Lady of Supreme Primordium said to the Emperor: "The Celestial Mother has now unveiled the wondrous mysteries of the jade tablets, disclosed the script of the Purple Terrace, and bestowed upon you the *Eightfold Assembled Writ* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*—truly the most precious and exalted, the profound contemplation of the Supreme Thearch.

Unless one is destined by mandate and aligned with the numinous, one shall never behold these texts. Though you have now obtained the *True Forms* and glimpsed their wondrous principles, without the talismans of the *Five Thearchs and Six Jia*, the *Leftward Numinous Flight of the Six Ding*, the *Register of the Six Yu Jade Maidens of Great Yin Who Traverse the Void*, the *Writ of the Six Wu of Great Yang That Summons Spirits and the Celestial Radiance of Refined Essence*, the *Script of Left Yi That Binds Chaos and Gathers Obscurity*, the *Law of Right Geng That Restrains and Gathers Destruction*, the *Eight Arts of the Six Ren and Gui That Conceal in Earth and Withdraw*, the *Nine Crimson Talismans of Bing and Ding That Enter Fire*, the *Method of the Six Xin That Enters Metal and Draws Forth the Yellow Waters and Moon Essence*, the *Art of the Six Si That Conceals the Golden Light of Stone Essence and Transforms Form*, the *Six Numinous Dignities of the Eight Endowments and Ten Resolutions of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You*, the *Three-Five Sequential Progression of the Purple Writ of Longevity and the Pristine Formulae of Earthly Perfection of Chou, Chen, Wei, and Xu*, and the *Inner Vision of the Central Realm of the Purple Crossing and Blazing Radiance of Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai*—how can one summon the mountain spirits, convene the earth deities, command the myriad essences, drive the hundred ghosts, summon tigers and leopards, or employ dragons?

What you know is but one part; you have yet to see the rest."

The Emperor descended from his mat and kowtowed until his forehead bled, saying: "This humble, muddied subject of the lower realm knows not the purity of the true. Today, hearing the Dao, is the meeting of this life with the Sagely Mother. Now that you have bestowed the *True Forms*, I shall cultivate them to transcend the world. The Lady has now instructed me that I must also seek the arts of the *Five Thearchs and Six Jia*, the *Six Ding*, and the *Six Wu* to summon the numinous. Having received this enlightenment, the benefit is boundless. I only beg for further instruction to quench my thirst, that this withered tree may be moistened by the numinous yang, and these scorched grasses may be graced by the sweet rains. I dare not speak at length; I only wish to be granted guidance."

The Lady of Supreme Primordium said: "I do not possess these texts. Long ago, on Mount Guang, I encountered the Azure Perfected Youth, who held this golden script of secret characters. He said that to seek the Dao and prolong life, one must master a thousand threads and ten thousand strands—all requiring the arts of the *Five Thearchs and Six Jia* and the *Numinous Flight*, the names and designations of the *Six Ding and Six Ren*—to petition for life extension, attain long life and enduring vision, command the host of spirits, and employ the hundred deities. Without the essential matters of the *Six Jia*, even one who guards the *True Forms* will find no path to communion with the numinous. You have the heart for this, so I have told you of these texts. I hope you will broadly seek and inquire further."

The Emperor persisted in his entreaties, kowtowing until blood flowed. The Lady of Supreme Primordium said: "I truly do not possess these texts. The reason I have shown you these twelve matters is to urge you to seek widely and amass them, that they may complement the use of the *True Forms*."

Then the Queen Mother addressed the Lady of Supreme Primordium: "The *True Forms* and precious writs are treasured by the numinous officials. This one has sought without ceasing, vowing to obtain them, so I have relaxed the prohibitions and made an exception to bestow them upon him. Yet the arts of the *Five Thearchs and Six Jia* for communing with the true and summoning spirits are subtle and remote; they demand utmost purity and sincerity, and are hardly suited for those of turbid and common nature. Now that I have granted the *True Forms* to this one, you, Lady, must instruct him in the path to summoning the numinous.

I recall that long ago, you and I ascended the dark mounds of the northern wilds and the Radiant Perfected Mountain, where we met the Prince Youth of the Swine. The Prince Youth then entreated me for the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme*. I said that the *Secret Words of the Three Primordials* could not be transmitted even to mid-ranking immortals. You, Lady, also spoke then, supporting the Prince Youth’s resolve. Since I could not refuse his earnest plea, I did not withhold out of mere stinginess."

Here the matter bears some resemblance to that earlier occasion. Later, I journeyed to the Vermilion Fire Mound of Cinnabar, where I tasted the numinous melon—its flavor was most excellent. Yet though this memory seems recent, seven thousand years have already passed.

Since you, Lady, have already revealed to him the titles of the scriptures and the twelve methods are complete, he must now craft and perfect them. Why then should one of his station kneel and beg, kowtowing until his forehead bleeds? The Supreme Primordial Lady said: "It is not that I, Ahuan, am stingy—it is simply that I did not bring them with me. These are the texts issued by the Red Youth, Perfected of the Celestial Writ of the Great Void. Their transmission is bound by prohibitions of gender, and they ought to be conferred only upon those who have attained the Way. I fear that this one’s talents are not yet equal to their use."

The Queen Mother’s expression grew stern, and she said: "If the celestial prohibitions are violated and the luminous statutes transgressed, transmission must be to the proper person, and conferral only to one who truly understands. Why then did you, Lady, speak to one of such modest talent of the titles of the *Numinous Flight* scriptures? Idle words leak, reckless speech divulges. To speak without transmitting is to trifle with the Dao of Heaven—this prohibition is no lighter than that of transmission itself. The Three Offices of the kalpas will surely hold you, Lady, accountable for this careless disclosure.

My *True Writ of the Five Marchmounts* was issued by the Celestial August Supreme. Its script is precious and wondrous, serving as the token of Heavenly Transcendents. How could it be fitting to bestow it upon Liu Che? It is only because of his earnest heart, his repeated petitions to the rivers and mountains, his diligent observance of purification rites in pursuit of a response from the divine immortals, and his aspiration to transcend the world—yet lacking a radiant teacher—that we have deigned to descend and grant him this. As for the arts of teaching immortality, we do not begrudge or withhold their transmission.

But do you, Lady, possess methods for summoning the numinous that you alone may withhold? The reason I now bestow upon him the *True Writ of the Realized Forms* is not because I believe he will necessarily attain the Way, but to validate his sincerity, to dispel his doubts in seeking immortality, and to guide and encourage those who turn toward transformation. I also wish to let the benighted know that such true matters exist between Heaven and Earth, enough to confound the reckless who refuse to believe. This is my intent.

Yet this one’s nature is lewd and violent, his refined essence impure. How could he become a true immortal, drifting through the ten directions of the void? If he diligently practices, it will suffice only to avoid death. As the luminous statutes declare: it is not attaining long life that is difficult, but hearing the Way; it is not hearing the Way that is difficult, but practicing it; it is not practicing it that is difficult, but persisting to the end. A skilled craftsman can give another the compass and square, but cannot ensure they will be skillful. A radiant teacher can impart wondrous arts, but cannot ensure they will be realized. Why then should you conceal them?

Do you not recall, Lady, when on behalf of Master Longsang you entreated me for the *Eight Radiance Swift-Healing Elixir* and the *Jade Tree Formula*?" The Supreme Primordial Lady’s countenance briefly shifted, and she knelt in apology, saying: "Ahuan once began studying the Way on the mounds of Guangdu. In the days when I was still cultivating the cinnabar sincerity beneath the Jian Tree and my arts had not yet come to fruition, the Lord of the Inverted Scenery and the Master of No-Constancy—these two were the numinous officials of the Great Clarity and the Harmonious Heavens of the Supreme Purity—conferred upon me the twelve methods of the *Left and Right Numinous Flight of the Six Jia*. On the day they first transmitted them, the two lords told Ahuan: 'For one newly studying the Way, transmission occurs once every forty years; for one who has attained the Way, once every four hundred years; for one who has attained immortality, once every four thousand years; for one who has attained the Realized, once every forty thousand years; for one who ascends to the Supreme, once every four hundred thousand years. Women transmit to women, men to men. The statutes and prohibitions of the Supreme have already been inscribed upon the talismans of Illustrious Life.'

Since receiving these texts, I have transmitted them to sixty-eight women. The worthy Great Lady Baolan is Ahuan’s disciple. What I have transmitted cannot be conferred upon men. I have observed that the Azure Perfected Youth of Fuguang Mountain once transmitted to the Central Primordial Lord of the Great Tenuity the twelve methods of the *Numinous Flight through the Void of the Six Jia of the Five Thearchs*, the *Left and Right Strategies of Celestial Radiance*, and other arts—identical in text to what I received, without a single difference. The Azure Perfected is a male official, and I have not heard of him transmitting them further. This one was once Ahuan’s disciple in the arts of entering fire. Now, at this very moment, I am taking them to confer upon Che. The reason I previously revealed the titles to him was to pity his earnestness and to strengthen his resolve to concentrate his qi. Now that he seeks them broadly, I will one day transmit them to him, also intending to confer upon a man as a man, in accordance with the statutes. Having diligently obtained them, he will know the preciousness of the celestial perfected, not merely trifling with or leaking the Dao of Heaven.

My original intent was thus. Ahuan, your servant, hopes not to be found wanting."

The wondrous subtlety of the Queen Mother’s *True Forms* is the token by which numinous beings transmit trust. The treasures of Heavenly Transcendents are sealed in golden caskets, worn to enter the Purple Tenuity. They proceed forward with their retinue, great tigers guarding the gates, crouching at the thresholds. Passing beyond the Great Clarity, they shake their bodies in the jade chambers, roaming the eastern seas to the left, bowing to the Eastern Mount, and reaching toward the Eternal Yang to the right. Below, they gaze upon the Fusang. Crossing the eight seas, they ride entwined dragons; traversing these renowned mountains, hosts of perfected welcome them. In motion, clouds and feathered canopies attend them; in stillness, they abide in eternal peace. Such is their majestic protection—yet these were never transmitted to the terrestrial officials. Now, Mother, you bestow them upon a corpse of lewd impurity, granting them to a body of dry bones. This is most unseemly.

Moreover, Ahuan possesses the lesser arts of the Six Jia, which alone can command the hundred spirits, summon the radiant essence of the sun and moon, conceal one’s form and shadow, transform and give life to the myriad things, enter water and fire, spit and shout into the dark void, see backward and hear afar, gather and bind a thousand essences, ride tigers and leopards in swift pursuit, pluck the moon’s radiance to attain long life, vanish into the eight earths, reverse the turning of the stars, prolong vision and lighten the body, and incline toward Heaven. How could these compare to the numinous scriptures of the Supreme, the wondrous texts of the Eight Assemblies? Their use is subtle and remote, allowing one to wander the palaces of the luminous scenery, to ascend the halls of drifting rosy clouds in a whirl of fragrance, to serve as lord of the Five Marchmounts, to hold the goblet of medicinal liquor, to mount nine dragons in empty ascent, and to descend upon purple swans in dark flight."

Queen Mother of the West smiled and said, "Could the earlier lapse truly be forgiven?"

The Primordial Lady of the Upper Heavens then commanded her attendant, Ji Lirong, to proceed directly to Mount Fu Guang, where she summoned the Azure Perfected Youth to present the twelve methods of the Six Jia’s left and right spirit-flight techniques for summoning the divine, which were to be bestowed upon Liu Che.

In an instant, the attendant returned, bearing a case woven with eight-colored jade and phoenix-script patterns—its dark radiance resplendent, its true essence magnificent and dazzling—along with a greeting from the Azure Perfected Youth.

The disciple A Chang said, "Earlier, I was ordered to the Crimson River to assist the Southern Perfected Seven Sovereigns of the Primordial in inspecting the tally of grass dragons and fierce beasts. Upon completing the task, I passed by the gate to receive instruction, where I learned that the Celestial Mother had invited me to the home of Liu Che. I never imagined that the august deities of Heaven would deign to descend into this foul and turbid realm. May I inquire after your well-being?"

When Attendant Ji Lirong arrived, she conveyed the exalted one’s desire to obtain the twelve sections of the golden script’s secret characters—the Six Jia’s spirit-flight techniques for commanding left and right essences—and to bestow them upon Liu Che. She sealed one copy and entrusted it to the messenger, saying, "Though Liu Che ardently seeks and admires the Way, he is in truth no immortal talent. How could I dare disseminate this art to a mere walking corpse?"

A Chang, having recently been in the imperial presence, had witnessed many memorials submitted to the throne: mountain spirits weeping in the herb groves, lonely souls wailing in distant lands, armies raised and clans rewarded for merit, yet soldiers forgotten in reward and punished in service, white bones strewn across the land, the common folk oppressed by extravagance and turmoil, cruelty and debauchery run rampant, sins already manifest before the Supreme, resentments already visible in the qi of the people, clamorous voices heard on all sides—he could never attain transcendence.

The Perfected One, moved by these admonitions, dared not refuse.

Queen Mother of the West smiled and said, "This child’s transgressions are indeed many, but the Emperor need not be so harsh in judgment."

Those who cherish the Dao and yearn for transcendence—if they concentrate their essence and sincerity, their will and thought, fasting and reflecting on their transgressions—may eliminate a month’s worth of faults in a single month. If they restrain themselves and return to goodness, revering the Perfected Spirits, preserving their true nature and guarding Unity, practicing this for a month, they may eliminate a year’s worth of faults. A Chang has pondered the Dao for many years, and his fasting and accumulation of merit have been diligent. He has repeatedly prayed to the true spirits of the famous mountains, wishing to seek deliverance. When weighing his merits against his faults, they nearly balance. Yet from this day forward, he must cultivate utmost sincerity, heed the words of the Lady of the Primordial Dawn, and no longer indulge in extravagance, debauchery, or cruelty, lest the myriad masses suffer and perish, lest the resentful souls and destitute ghosts raise accusations of desecration and corpses drenched in blood, and lest the words of reward for merit be forgotten.

Thereupon, the Lady of the Primordial Dawn rose from her seat, holding in her hand a scroll of eight-colored jade inscribed with phoenix patterns. She raised her gaze to the heavens and prayed to the Emperor, saying:

"Vast are the Nine Heavens, radiant is the Supreme Luminance. The divine shines upon the mysterious and tranquil, the pure and void, bright and clear. Those who ascend the void attain subtlety; those who guard their qi attain life. When utmost devotion to the Dao is reached, the tranquil responds to true sincerity. To toil the spirit and humiliate the form is to secure peace, essence, longevity, and glory. I bestow upon A Chang the *Lingfei* and the Six Ding spirits of the left and right, the *Celestial Light* and *Essence-Strategy*, with which he may tread the void, conceal his form, attain long life and enduring vision, and restore youth, leaving white hair behind while retaining black.

My transmission spans forty thousand cycles; A Chang’s transmission occurs at the age of forty. Should he violate or leak these teachings, he will surely sink into the dark netherworld. Beware this calamity! I dare to admonish you, Liu, that your master is the Lesser Lord of the Azure Youth, the true master of the Central Yellow Dao Lord of the Supreme, and an inner-chamber disciple of the Celestial King of the Primordial Beginning. His surname is Yanling, his given name Yang, and his courtesy name Bihua. His form bears the appearance of an infant, hence the immortals’ title of *Azure Perfected Lesser Youth*. As for his vessel, it is luminous and all-encompassing, sagely and all-adaptive, a mysterious mirror that discerns the obscure, a talent that distinguishes truth from falsehood. Roaming the boundless, wielding the primal authority, his palace abides in the Mystic Garden, where he governs the duties of transcendents. Should you honor your master, your wishes shall be fulfilled. Should you neglect what is transmitted, your life will surely collapse."

When the Lady of the Primordial Dawn finished her prayer, she pointed with her hand to each of the instructions and methods she had bestowed upon the Emperor. The first scroll contained the talismans of the Five Thearchs and the Six Jia spirits of the left and right, the *Lingfei*. The second scroll contained the records of the Six Ding spirits, the *Passage to the True and Concealment of the Void*, and the Jade Maidens.

The third scroll contains the *Book of the Six Wu of the Great Yang, Summoning Spirits and the Celestial Radiance’s Strategic Essence*. The fourth scroll contains the *Writ of the Left Yi, the Primordial Chaos and the Binding of Meng*. The fifth scroll contains the *Statutes of the Right Geng, the White Refinement and the Restraint of Slaying*. The sixth scroll contains the *Methods of the Six Dun of Ren and Gui, the Eight Arts of Concealment and Earthly Seclusion*. The seventh scroll contains the *Talismans of Bing and Ding Entering Fire, the Nine Crimson Striated Writ*. The eighth scroll contains the *Methods of the Six Xin Entering Metal, Attracting the Yellow Water and the Moon’s Splendor*. The ninth scroll contains the *Methods of the Six Si, the Stone Essence and the Concealment of the Golden Radiance’s Shadow to Transform Form*. The tenth scroll contains the *Eight Endowments and Ten Secrets of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, the Sixfold Numinous Demeanor*. The eleventh scroll contains the *Secrets of the Earthly True and the Unadorned of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei, the Purple Writ of Longevity and the Three-Five Sequential Progression of Earth*. The twelfth scroll contains the *Purple Measure and the Blazing Radiance of Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai, the Inner Vision of the Central Realm*.

When all twelve matters were complete, she again addressed the Emperor, saying: "The Five Thearchs are the celestial essences of the cardinal directions. The Six Jia are the numinous conduits of the six positions. The Great Yin possesses the subtlety of latent emptiness, the divine spirit of the *Dun* that treads the mechanism of opportunity. Autumn harbors the sprouting of spring, giving birth to a thousand truths. When it moves, stillness responds in waves; when it rests, rivers and mountains settle into vast tranquility. Thus, not even the tip of a hair shifts, yet the loftiest peaks may be toppled.

How majestic is the Great Yang’s summoning of spirits, driving the ten thousand numina to swift obedience! The Six Wu take flight, and the spirits rejoice; the celestial radiance kindles brilliance in the light. To the west, lightning flashes and thunder resounds; at the Mulberry Fields, the void trembles to form thunder. This is the day of the yang spirit, when Bing’s fiery might manifests the primal authority of the Nine Heavens.

The Left Yi’s chaotic vastness is where the myriad things first communicate. As yang subtly ascends, the azure radiance responds with the coiled dragon. Light clouds waft their splendor, whispering winds stir the unborn; the divine, though faint, gathers in its abode, and the true resonance must inevitably converge. When the myriad springs return to their beginning, this is called the *Binding of Meng*.

The Right Geng’s white autumn gathers the scattered and assembles the dark. It commands the ten thousand spirits to serve me; the White Tiger stirs with boundless vigor, and the Maiden of Metal arises to commune with the true. Extending the gaze of the Nine Heavens’ paths, the metal essence and earthly numen come to guard the body. Against those who harbor malice, it is thus called the *Statute of Restraint and Slaying*.

The Six Dun of Ren and Gui sink into rootless depths, concealing the myriad blades. They traverse hills and mountains, hide in the earth, and obscure their shadows. They dam the rushing currents and block the rivers. The Eight Arts and Six Strategies ensure everlasting victory. Those who bear my Six Dun shall abide in enduring vision and eternal life.

Bing and Ding enter fire, soaring through the misty clouds. The Nine Crimson Dragon Writ shines with dazzling brilliance. When you employ these striated talismans, a thousand spirits will come to pay homage. Thus, the spirit of Bing revolves the cinnabar fire to disperse obstructions, and the blazing radiance ascends as a guard—marvelous beyond compare.

The Six Xin enter metal, dissolving harm and grinding away obstacles. They attract the essence of the sun to obtain the pearl of yang radiance, and seek the moon’s spirit to acquire the blossom of the Yellow Water. They can summon the numinous fungi of the Eight Stones and draw the cinnabar clouds of Fusang. They revel in the cloud nectar of the cinnabar court and soar upon the azure rivers of the Mystic River. Though their use is slight, their benefits are manifold. Those who bear these Six Xin shall surely reach my abode.

The Six Si’s stone essence flows with golden liquid radiance, transforming in myriad ways—who could withstand it for a thousand years? Those who bear my Six Si shall change form and roam freely, attaining longevity that spans the heavens without beginning or end. How profound is this writ—most essential and difficult to fathom!

Zi, Wu, Mao, and You are the great deities of the four quarters, standing sentinel at the cardinal boundaries. The Eight Endowments and Ten Secrets summon the descent of spirits, which must be preceded by purification and sacrifice. All affairs are accomplished through meticulous care, and the thousand spirits seek communion through this art. Know my name, and celestial beings may be summoned.

Chou, Chen, Wei, and Xu are the talismans of the Earthly True. Roaming the Five Marchmounts requires the Purple Writ. The secrets of the Unadorned and the arcane incantations enable one to ascend the void. Following the Three-Five sequence, you shall ride with the spirits as in the same chariot.

Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai can dispel flying calamities. The Purple Measure and Blazing Radiance, inner vision and reversed hearing, divine incantations that penetrate, the Six Jia that gather and restrain—earthly officials roam the heavens, treading the earth with the true. Have no doubt in this.

These twelve matters were sealed by the Thearch upon the Terrace of the Mystic Radiance. Guard them with utmost secrecy.

The Queen Mother of the West said: "These are all the numinous writings of the Great Spirit, compiled by the Supreme Three Heavens, or edited and finalized by the Celestial Perfected of the Three Sovereigns, or revealed by the Red Youths, the True Parents of the Nine Heavens. Such talismanic texts are concealed in the Terrace of Purple Mounds, hidden within the chambers of the Numinous Altar, sealed in caskets of resplendent jade, wrapped in silk of orchid and bamboo slips, bound with plain silk of the northern weave, and stamped with the seal of the Supreme Thearch.

The various noble and numinous perfected ones descend to roam the mountains and rivers, gazing upon the forests and peaks with distant vision, observing those who study with sincerity. Some instruct them in the Dao and virtue, while others transmit to them celestial talismans.

For those who have not yet completed their study of the Dao, these writings may be transmitted to one person every forty years. If no suitable recipient exists, two may be taught at once after eighty years. Those who have attained the Dao may transmit them to one person every four hundred years. If no suitable recipient exists, two may be taught at once after eight hundred years. Those who have attained immortality may transmit them to one person every four thousand years. If no suitable recipient exists, two may be taught at once after eight thousand years. Those who have attained the True may transmit them to one person every forty thousand years. If no suitable recipient exists, two may be taught at once after eighty thousand years. Those who ascend to the Supreme may transmit them to one person every four hundred thousand years.

Should they be transmitted to an unworthy recipient, this is called *leaking the Heavenly Dao*. To withhold transmission when a worthy recipient exists is called *sealing the Heavenly Treasure*. To transmit recklessly without regard for the proper limits is called *trifling with the Heavenly Elder*. To receive them without reverence is called *disdaining the Heavenly Ornament*. Leaking, sealing, trifling, and disdaining—these four are the blades and axes that bring death, the chariots that extend misfortune.

Those who leak them shall die by the roadside, their bodies reduced to dust and their bones shattered. Those who seal them shall be struck blind and deaf in their next life, their fate withering and their end untimely. Those who trifle shall bring calamity upon their parents and be summoned to the Dark Capital for punishment. Those who disdain shall meet a violent end and fall into evil destinies, casting aside infirmities upon future generations."

Those who exceed even these transgressions shall face the severing of their lineage and the annihilation of their clan.

Those who share the Dao are called *Heavenly Kin*; those who share the same heart are called *Earthly Love*. Those who pursue the Dao ought to transmit with mutual affection, sharing glory and disgrace alike, tending the True Unity, treasuring their essence and vital fluids, and reverently nurturing harmonious qi. When qi is whole and spirit returns, they shall surely join the assembly of the numinous.

Should they fail in this, Heaven shall send down pestilence upon them. These are the statutes and prohibitions of the Dao, and thus I now admonish you—you must not be careless.

Yet this method is meant to be transmitted, though it should be regulated by the proper time limits. If one is truly worthy, there is no need to wait until the limit is reached before bestowing it.

If you wish to transmit the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, Dong Zhongshu is a fitting recipient. If you wish to impart the *Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talismans of the Left and Right*, you may transmit them to Li Shaojun. These two are those who have attained the Dao.

The Queen Mother then commanded her attendant, Song Lingbin, to retrieve another diagram for the Emperor. Lingbin reached into her robe and produced a scroll, encased in a cloud-brocade pouch, its script and form as radiant and precise as those in the earlier vessel. The Queen Mother rose and placed it into the Emperor’s hands with her own.

She then pronounced this incantation:
*"Heaven is high, Earth is low,
The Five Peaks anchor form.
Primordial streams surge dark,
Deep marshes yield dark essence.
Heaven revolves through nine paths,
Six Harmonies sustain balance.
The Eight Assemblies of the Most High,
Achieve the flight of celestial beings.
True weariness, steadfast trust—
Through these, the numinous is reached.
Leaked or lost, decayed or spoiled,
Yet true attainment leads to long life.
Grasp this well and be vigilant—
I dare to instruct you, Liu!"*

With the incantation complete, she bestowed it upon the Emperor. The Emperor bowed, touching his forehead to the ground.

Queen Mother spoke: "Those who first study the Daoist talismans should separately offer sacrifices to the Five Peaks and the various perfected immortals, purify themselves through fasting, and then wear them. Now, with these miscellaneous matters of the Six Jia, one must observe proper regulations and coordinate accordingly—this should be clearly followed as prescribed.

If you can diligently cultivate integrity, correct your conduct, turn from evil to practice goodness, then after three years and seven months, return to inform me of your desire for the essential Dao."

Presently, from the Vermilion Bird window south of the hall, a figure suddenly appeared, peering in at the immortal officials. The Emperor, startled, asked, "Who is that?"

Queen Mother replied, "Do you not recognize this person? He is your attendant, Dongfang Shuo, my neighbor’s younger brother. His nature is playful and witty, and he has come three times to steal these peaches. Long ago, this man served as an emissary of the Most High, sent to Fangzhang to assist the Three Heavens’ Registrar of Destiny in recording the affairs of the immortals. Yet when Shuo arrived at Fangzhang, he indulged only in wandering among mountains and waters, neglecting to cultivate harmonious qi. Instead, he wantonly manipulated thunder and lightning, stirred waves, and summoned winds. The winds and rains fell out of season, yin and yang clashed, causing dragons and whales to crawl on land, mountains to collapse, borders to crumble, and the sea to dry up violently. The Yellow Bird nested in the abyss, and farming suffered. Drunk on jade wine, he lost the harmony of his office and failed in his mandated duties. Thus, the Elder of the Nine Springs reported this to the Most High, who then demoted and banished him to the mortal realm, exiling him from the court of the Great Clarity to dwell in this turbid land. Recently, the two immortals of Jinhua Mountain and the Lord of Jiuyi petitioned on his behalf, seeking clemency."

Thereupon, the Emperor realized Shuo was no ordinary mortal. As the feast neared its end and the wine flowed freely, the Supreme Primordial Lady herself plucked the *Cloud Forest* zither, her fingers striking awe-inspiring melodies. The pure notes rang clear, and a profound breeze spread in all directions. She then sang the *Step of the Mysterious* aria:

*"Long ago, I trod the true Dao of the Mysterious,
Ascending on soaring steps to the Great Rosy Clouds.
Bearing the steep peaks, I reached the Gate of Heaven,
And asked where the Most High’s abode might be.
Suddenly passing the Purple Tenuity Enclosure,
I saw perfected ones arrayed like hemp.
Green auroras rose in clear recitation,
And numinous canopies gleamed with crimson blossoms.
The Orchid Palace opened its jasper gates,
While azure skies unveiled their wondrous sands.
Cinnabar terraces wove empty structures,
Shimmering with radiant light.
Flying phoenixes perched on ridgepole peaks,
And the Torch Dragon coiled in sinuous repose.
Jade embryos came from scarlet sprouts,
Nine hues intertwining in profusion.
Embracing the light, I refined my immortal bones—
Through ten thousand kalpas, I remained youthful.
Who says life must have an end?
The Fusang tree does not wither."*

Queen Mother then commanded her attendant, Tian Sifei, to respond with a song:

*"At dawn, I ascend the Palace of Great Rosy Clouds,
Embracing these eight jade orchids.
At dusk, I enter the Gate of the Mysterious Origin,
Gathering herbs and plucking stalks of jasper.
I wash my feet in the Gourd River,
Where the Weaving Maiden stands by the ford.
Inhaling and exhaling the auroras,
Their savor suffices for a single meal.
How majestic is the Purple Tenuity!
Its wondrous wheels glow crimson.
At dawn, I depart from the Boundless Court,
By dusk, I lodge within the Enclosure of the Curved Array.
Going our separate ways, our paths diverge—
Each must abide in what brings peace.
The Two Modes endure as ever,
Why doubt the myriad eons?
Do not speak of this to worldly folk—
The walking corpses would find these words hard to bear."*

When the songs concluded, she proceeded to inform Emperor Wu of the names of the immortals’ attendants, as well as the names of their headdresses, sashes, and ritual implements—so that he might record them.

At daybreak, Queen Mother took her leave. The Supreme Primordial Lady then said to the Emperor, "As for Li Shaojun, he is wholly devoted to diligent cultivation, his principles subtle and profound—he is certain to attain the Dao. However, he seems not yet to possess the *Six Jia Numinous Flight* texts. You should present them to him."

The Emperor replied, "Very well."

Then the Lady and the Queen Mother departed together in the same carriage. As they set off, their retinue of men and horses, dragons and tigers, and their majestic procession were just as they had been upon arrival. Clouds billowed and swirled, transforming entirely into fragrant mist; gazing southwest, the sight lingered long before fading away.

After witnessing the Queen Mother and the Supreme Primordial Lady, the Emperor came to believe that divine immortals indeed existed in the world, and he began to consider plans for leaving the mortal realm. Yet he remained indulgent in sensual pleasures, unrestrained in his nature, and ceaseless in warfare. The people groaned under the burden of labor, and the dead lamented their unjust fates.

That year, he constructed the Gansui Palace and the Tower of Communion with Heaven, as well as the Lianlian Lodge in Chang’an. The King of Chaoxian attacked the eastern commandery of Liaodong, prompting the Emperor to recruit condemned criminals from across the land to strike back. In the eighth month, nine stalks of grain sprouted within the Gansui Palace. He issued an edict: *"Nine stalks of grain with conjoined leaves have grown in the Gansui Palace—Heaven’s vast presence descends no differently than in a humble chamber. The August One bestows upon me great favor; let there be a general amnesty throughout the land. Grant the households of Yunyang a hundred oxen and wine, and compose the Song of the Grain Chamber."*

By the third year of the *Yuanfeng* era, he had assembled three hundred performers for the *Jiaodi* games. In the fourth year of *Yuanfeng*, he again journeyed to Yong to offer sacrifices to the Five Sacrificial Altars.

By the fifth year of *Yuanfeng*, he conducted an inner tour of the ancestral temples, proceeding to the Shengtang Shrine to sacrifice to Yu Shun and ascending Mount Wan at Jiuyi and Mount Tianzhu. In the third month of spring, he returned to Mount Tai, expanding its sacred enclosure on the *jiazi* day. He sacrificed to his august ancestor Gaozu in the Hall of Light, offering him as associate to the Supreme God. There he received the feudal lords and kings in audience.

In the sixth year of *Yuanfeng*, he journeyed to Huizhong and constructed the Shoushan Palace. In the third month, he traveled to the region east of the Yellow River to sacrifice to the Earth Queen. Earlier, on the seventh day of the seventh month in the second year of *Yuanfeng*, the Queen Mother of the West and the Upper Prime Lady descended before Emperor Wu. The Queen Mother bestowed upon him the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* and the *Scripture of Radiant Life*, while the Upper Prime Lady conferred the *Twelve Arts of the Numinous Flight of the Six Jia Spirits*. On the day the Queen Mother and Upper Prime Lady appeared to the Emperor, they expounded at length—now the secrets of prolonging life, now the methods of summoning divine spirits, now the techniques of riding the void, now the arts of treading the mysterious. Of all these essential and wondrous teachings, the Emperor compiled a single scroll. Together with the *True Form Scriptures* and the *Six Jia Numinous Flight* texts he had received, he placed them in a casket of yellow gold, sealed in a case of white jade, its rollers of coral, its wrapping of purple brocade. He enshrined it atop the Wuliang Terrace, where he would fast and purify himself, donning ceremonial robes to approach it in reverence, burning incense and rinsing his hands before unsealing and perusing the texts.

From the time he first received the scriptures, six years passed, and his mind grew ever more at ease, his lofty aspirations ever more assured. He believed that the divine immortals had truly descended and that he would surely transcend the mortal world. Yet his vigor and strength remained untempered by utmost sincerity. He erected palaces and towers, exhausting the people; buried surrendered soldiers alive; launched distant campaigns against the barbarians. The roads swelled with lamentation, the frontier fortresses flowed with blood. In every matter, he spurned the profound admonitions of the Queen Mother and the subtle exhortations of the Upper Prime Lady. Thus the Queen Mother never came again.

In the eleventh month of the first year of *Taichu*, on the *yiyou* day, heavenly fire consumed the Terrace of the Soaring Beam. Therein, the *True Form Charts*—four scrolls in all—were lost to the flames. The Queen Mother had once warned Emperor Wu that he would fail to heed her teachings, and so she brought this conflagration upon him. Yet earlier, following the Queen Mother’s instructions, the Emperor had fasted in the seventh month of the third year of *Yuanfeng* and transmitted the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* to Dong Zhongshu, who ascended to receive it. And following the Upper Prime Lady’s words, he had fasted in the seventh month of the fourth year of *Yuanfeng* and transmitted the *Twelve Arts of the Numinous Flight of the Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirits* to Li Shaojun, who ascended to copy and receive it. These texts that survive and circulate in the world were first preserved through these two men.

After losing the scriptures, the Emperor repented his failure to cultivate virtue, realizing that his Dao had been forfeit. Later, Dongfang Shuo one day mounted a cloud-dragon and soared away. Many witnessed him ascending toward the northwest; when they looked up again, a great mist had enveloped him, and he was nowhere to be seen. The Emperor grew ever more remorseful. That year, he performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Song and the Shan sacrifice at Mount Hua, then journeyed east to the shores of the Bohai Sea, gazing toward Penglai. Facing heaven, he swore an oath, yearning for a divine response—but none came. In spring, he returned to receive the annual accounts at Gansui. In the second month, he began construction of the Jianzhang Palace.

In the fifth month of summer, the calendar was reformed, establishing the first month as the beginning of the year. The color yellow was esteemed, the number five was employed, and official titles were harmonized with the pitches of the *lü* and *lǚ*. This originated from the Queen Mother of the West’s intent.

In the third month of the second year of the *Taichu* era, the Emperor journeyed east to the banks of the Yellow River and performed the sacrifice to the Earth. In the first month of the third year of *Taichu*, he traveled east to inspect the seacoast. In the fourth month of summer, he returned and carried out the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. In the fourth year of *Taichu*, construction began on the Minguang Palace, and the reign title was changed to *Tianhan*.

In the first month of the first year of *Tianhan*, he journeyed east to the banks of the Yellow River and performed the sacrifice to the Earth. In the spring of the second year of *Tianhan*, he traveled to the Eastern Sea. Upon his return, he visited Huizhong. In the third month, he journeyed to Mount Tai, performed the Feng sacrifice, and offered rites in the Hall of Light.

In the fifth month of the third year of the *Taishi* era, he traveled to the Eastern Sea, where the mountains resounded with cries of "Long live the Emperor!" In winter, he bestowed five thousand coins upon each household along his route, and a bolt of silk upon every widow, orphan, and solitary elder.

In the third month of the fourth year of *Taishi*, he journeyed to Mount Tai and offered sacrifices to the Queen Mother of the West, seeking a divine response. In the spring of the fourth year of *Zhenghe*, he traveled to Donglai, approached the great sea, purified himself in fasting, and worshipped the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Highest Prime, yet no response came. Upon his return, he journeyed to Mount Tai and performed the Feng sacrifice. On the *gengyin* day, he offered rites in the Hall of Light and changed the reign title to *Houyuan*.

In the first month of the first year of *Houyuan*, he journeyed to the Gansui Palace to emulate the rites of the ancient Xia. In the seventh month of autumn, an earthquake struck, and springs gushed forth. In the second year, he summoned the feudal lords to the Gansui Palace and bestowed gifts upon the imperial clan. In the second month, the Emperor fell ill and traveled to the Wuzuo Palace in Zhulu. On the *dingmao* day, the Emperor passed away and was laid in state in the front hall of the Weiyang Palace. In the third month, he was interred at Maoling.

On the evening of the burial, the Emperor’s coffin stirred of its own accord, and sounds were heard outside the palace—this occurred several times. An extraordinary fragrance also filled the air. After the burial was complete, the tomb mound was enveloped in a thick mist, and the gates collapsed; the mist persisted for over a month.

Within the Emperor’s tomb, there had originally been a jade box and a jade staff, two items he had treasured and used. Suddenly, they appeared in the world of men. Those who saw them recognized their significance and reported it to the authorities. The officials questioned the seller, who turned out to be a merchant. He had come from beyond the pass to the Luoyang market, where he encountered a man in the northern carriage lane selling the two items. The price was thirty bolts of plain silk and ninety thousand coins, and he purchased them. The merchant truly did not know the name of the seller of the box and staff. He had arrived in the Luoyang market the previous day and seen the items being sold. The facts matched his account, and the officials reported them. The two items were recorded and entered into the imperial registry, and the merchant was released without further inquiry.

Before the Emperor’s passing, he had issued a prior decree that over forty scrolls of miscellaneous texts—those he had often read and cherished—should be placed in his coffin to accompany him in burial. In the second year of the *Yankang* era, Li You, a clerk in the Hedong commandery, entered Mount Baodu in Shangdang to gather herbs. Within a secluded chamber, he discovered the buried texts, stored in a golden box. On the back of the scrolls were inscribed the names of the Eastern Observatory officials and the dates of their transcription.

Among Emperor Wu’s attendants had been a scribe named Ran Deng. Upon seeing the texts and the box, he wept and said, "These are the very items placed in the late Emperor’s coffin at his burial. I personally arranged them within—how they came to be here, I cannot fathom." Emperor Xuan was deeply moved and astonished. The texts were returned to the shrine of Emperor Wu.

Maoling remained intact as before, yet the book box and jade staff had suddenly emerged from beneath the earth. Moreover, the items appeared fresh and unblemished, without a speck of dust. Those who witnessed this were greatly perplexed and could not explain it.

According to the *Scripture of the Nine Capitals and Dragon Perfections*, those who attain the lower ranks of immortality must first die, pass through the Great Yin to refine their corpses, and traverse the Earth’s Gate before achieving liberation through corpse-transformation.

Now, Emperor Wu’s box, staff, and miscellaneous texts were all interred with him in his coffin, yet they emerged inexplicably from the void—his staff sold in the marketplace, his books discovered in a mountain chamber. If this were not the work of subtle and wondrous divine transformation, how could such things occur? Thus, it remains uncertain whether Emperor Wu truly died; he may well have undergone a numinous transformation in accordance with the cosmic rhythm.

When Wang Mang usurped the throne and reached the second year of the *Dihuang* era, he dispatched envoys to perform sacrifices at the Han imperial tombs, invoking auspicious omens. Upon arriving at Maoling, the envoys heard four great sighs and long groans rising from beneath the earth. Terrified, they reported this to Wang Mang, who remarked, “Emperor Wu must resent the lateness of my sacrifices.” He then ordered an additional grand offering of the highest ritual.
