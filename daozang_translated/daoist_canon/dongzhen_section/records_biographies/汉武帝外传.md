After Emperor Wu heard the Queen Mother of the West’s words, he learned that within the vast seas of the eight directions lay the Ten Isles—places untouched by human footsteps. He then realized that Dongfang Shuo was no ordinary mortal. Thus, he summoned him to a secluded chamber and personally inquired about the locations of the Ten Isles and the names of their treasures, which the Emperor recorded.

Dongfang Shuo replied: "Your servant is merely a student of immortality, not one who has attained the Dao. Given the splendor of the imperial court, which summons Confucians and Mohists within the bounds of proper governance while suppressing the Way of the reclusive in favor of empty and strange practices, I concealed my eremitic nature to attend the royal court, hiding my arts of nurturing life to serve the vermilion gates. This was also because Your Majesty favors the Dao and sought to temper the display of imperial majesty.

I once followed my master on his travels, journeying north to Crimson Mound, Fusang, the Clam Sea, the Hills of Dark Night, the Pure Yang Tumulus, beneath the Azure Beginning, and the Abyss of the Moon Palace. I wandered within the Seven Mounds, circled the Ten Zhe Rivers, trod the Red Continent and roamed the Five Peaks, traversed marshes and rested upon renowned mountains. From my youth until now, I have traversed the Six Heavens, and the celestial radiance I have witnessed culminates in these places. Yet I am not like the transcendent beings who soar through the void, the flying immortals of the celestial bureaus, who ascend and descend the Nine Heavens, gazing upon all directions. They roam north to the Pole Star and the Celestial Enclosure, where the Canopy of Hua shines; they soar south to the Great Xia, dwelling in the Cinnabar Dawn. To the east, they reach the Radiant Yang Clouds; to the west, they approach the Frigid Caverns. These are realms beyond the reach of sun and moon, untouched by the Silver River. Above, there is nothing more; below, there is no foundation. How could my humble knowledge compare? I am ashamed that it does not suffice to answer Your Majesty’s broad inquiries."

During Emperor Wu’s imperial tour, as he passed through Hejian, a purple-blue *qi* rose from the earth and connected with the heavens. The court diviners who observed the omens declared that beneath it must reside an extraordinary woman. The Son of Heaven paid her homage, and the Emperor dispatched envoys to seek her out. They found a woman in an empty pavilion, her beauty unparalleled, both hands clenched into fists. The Emperor ordered her to open her hands, but no matter how many times they were pried apart, they would not unfurl. The Emperor then personally spread her fingers, and they immediately extended. From then on, she received his favor and was titled Lady Fist. Later, she was promoted to Swift Consort and resided in the Gouyi Palace. Skilled in the arts of the Plain Girl, she enjoyed great favor.

After fourteen months of pregnancy, she gave birth, and the child was Emperor Zhao. The Emperor remarked: "In ancient times, Emperor Yao was born after fourteen months—now Lady Gouyi is the same." Thus, he named her gate the "Gate of Yao’s Mother."

Later, when the Emperor reached Ganquan Palace, he favored her again. She told him: "By my fate, I was destined to bear Your Majesty a son. When the boy turns seven, I shall die. This year, I will not return. I pray Your Majesty take care of yourself." As her words ended, she suddenly passed away. After her burial, her body vanished, and a fragrance lingered for over ten *li*.

Thus, she was buried at Yunling. The Emperor grieved deeply and, suspecting she was no ordinary person, had her tomb opened for inspection. The coffin was empty, with no corpse—only her garments and shoes remained. He then erected the Tongling Terrace at Ganquan. Often, dark crows gathered and came and went upon the terrace, ceasing only in the reign of Emperor Xuan.

When Emperor Wu ascended Mount Tai to perform the feng and shan sacrifices, among the Daoist practitioners of Mount Tai was one known as Master Jiqiu, whom those who recognized him claimed had lived a hundred years yet appeared ever younger. On the day of the feng sacrifice, as the Emperor prepared to ascend the mountain, Master Jiqiu donned a *zhangfu* cap, wore yellow robes, and came forth bearing a zither to greet him, saying: "Do not lightly ascend the mountain, for you will surely injure your foot." The Emperor did not heed his words. After traveling several *li*, a stone snapped his toe, forcing him to halt. He performed the sacrifices and returned.

The Prince of Huainan was fond of learning and the arts, collecting Daoist texts from across the realm and summoning masters of esoteric techniques. All cultivated *qi* and could summon clouds and rain. The common folk spread tales that the prince could summon immortals to keep him company, transforming at will—now a youth, now an elder. The prince himself could conceal his form and fly, subsisting on *qi* without eating. The Emperor, hearing of this, admired his feats and wished to learn his Way. The prince refused to teach him, claiming no such arts existed. Enraged, the Emperor prepared to execute the Prince of Huainan. The prince, learning of this, issued orders to his ministers and vanished, his whereabouts unknown. The people of his state all spoke of him as a divine immortal, and some claimed to have seen him. Fearing unrest among the people, the Emperor ordered the execution of the prince’s household and displayed their heads to pacify the masses, declaring them those of the Prince of Huainan. He confiscated the prince’s esoteric texts, gaining some knowledge of alchemical arts, though not their essential methods. Trials of these techniques often proved ineffective.

Having been moved by the Way of Huainan, the Emperor summoned masters of esoteric arts from all directions—thousands emerged from Yan and Qi alone. Among them was Li Shaofang of Qi, who at two hundred years of age bore the complexion of a child. He crafted various elixirs, all of which proved efficacious. The Emperor trusted him deeply, appointing him General of Literary Accomplishment and treating him with the courtesy due a guest.

Within the Palace of Sweet Springs, he commissioned murals of the Supreme One and various deities to be worshipped. Shaoweng claimed: "First summon the Supreme One, then one may ascend to heaven; only after ascending to heaven may one reach Penglai." Yet after more than a year, no sign appeared, and the Emperor grew weary. Shaogong then employed methods to summon ghosts and spirits, all of which proved effective—save for the rites to the Supreme One, which after years yielded no response. The Emperor, impatient and severe by nature, was deeply perplexed, while Shaoweng grew ever more arrogant. Enraged, the Emperor had him executed.

A month after Wencheng’s execution, an envoy returning from the eastern passes with tribute encountered him at the Cao Pavilion. Wencheng said to the envoy: "Convey my regrets to the Emperor: could he not endure a few more days and thus ruin great matters? Let him take care henceforth. Forty years from now, seek me on Mount Laocheng, and we shall serve together without resentment." The envoy returned and reported this in full. The Emperor ordered the coffin opened, but nothing was found inside—only a single bamboo mat. Suspecting Wencheng’s disciples had stolen and concealed his body, he had them arrested and interrogated, yet no trace could be found. The Emperor deeply regretted the execution.

He once more summoned masters of esoteric arts and resumed the rites to the Supreme One at Sweet Springs. Additionally, he set up a separate altar to worship Wencheng, performing the rites himself. At that time, Dong Commandery presented a dwarf, five inches tall, fully clad in robes and cap. The Emperor suspected it was a mountain spirit. He placed it upon a table and summoned Dongfang Shuo. Shuo arrived and addressed the dwarf: "Great Spirit, why have you suddenly rebelled and come here? Has your mother not yet returned?" The dwarf made no reply, whereupon Shuo pointed and said to the Emperor: "The Queen Mother of the West plants peach trees that bear fruit once every three thousand years. This wretched child has stolen from them three times, displeasing the Queen Mother, and so has been banished here."

The Emperor was greatly astonished, all the more convinced that Shuo was no mortal. The dwarf then said to the Emperor: "The Queen Mother has sent me to inform Your Majesty that the method of seeking the Dao lies solely in purity and stillness—restlessness is unsuited to it. Five years hence, she shall meet with you." With these words, the dwarf vanished.

The Emperor grew ever more vexed and again summoned Dongfang Shuo to question him. Shuo replied: "Your Majesty ought to know this yourself; I dare not speak of it." In the end, he remained silent. The Emperor, recognizing his numinous nature, dared not press him further.

A man of Qi, Gongsun Qing, said to Suo Zhong: "I possess esoteric writings from my teacher concerning the matter of the sacred tripods. I wish to present them through you. If I am granted an audience, I shall offer a jade ram as a gift." Suo Zhong agreed, but upon examining the text, he harbored doubts and declined, saying: "The affair of the treasure tripods has already been settled; there is nothing more to be said."

Gongsun Qing then had it memorialized through the eunuch Ping. The document stated: "When the Yellow Emperor obtained the sacred tripod, he inquired of Guiyu Qu, who replied: 'The Emperor has gained the tripod and its divine radiance, prolonging his years.' On the first day of the ji-you year, at dawn on the winter solstice, he attained the celestial reckoning, marking the end and the beginning anew. Thereupon, the Emperor tracked the sun’s course and calculated the cycles—after twenty reckonings, totaling one hundred and eighty years, the Yellow Emperor ascended to immortality in the heavens. This year, the winter solstice coincides with the first day of the month, aligning with the time of the Yellow Emperor. Your servant, at risk of death, ventures to memorialize this."

Emperor Wu was greatly pleased and summoned Qing to question him.

Qing replied: "I received this text from Master Shen, who has since died, his body dissolved in transcendence."

The Emperor asked: "Who was Master Shen?"

Qing answered: "Anqi Xiansheng of Qi, who together with me received the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and this text on the sacred tripod. Master Shen often told me: 'The sage of Han lies among the great-grandsons of Gaozu. When the sacred tripod emerges and communicates with the divine, when the Feng and Shan sacrifices ascend Mount Tai, only the Yellow Emperor and the Lord of Han shall achieve this. When the Feng sacrifice is performed atop the mountain, one may then ascend to heaven. The Yellow Emperor waged war against the hundred ghosts and studied immortality, and only after more than a hundred years did he attain communion with the divine. The Yellow Emperor offered sacrifices to the Supreme Lord at the suburban altar of Yong, fasting in seclusion for three months. Guiyu’s body dissolved in transcendence and departed, whereupon he was buried at Yong. Yong—now the great tomb of Hong is its successor. The Yellow Emperor summoned the ten thousand spirits in the Hall of Light—this is Gansui. The Gate of Cold through which he ascended to immortality—this is Gukou. The Yellow Emperor mined copper from Mount Shou and cast the tripod at Mount Ke. When the tripod was completed, a dragon descended, its whiskers hanging down, to welcome the Emperor onto its back. Over seventy of his ministers and palace ladies followed him onto the dragon, but lesser attendants could not ascend. They grasped the dragon’s whiskers, which tore away, and the Emperor’s bow fell. The people gazed up as the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven, clutching his bow and the dragon’s whiskers, weeping. Thus, later generations named his tomb Dinghu, and his bow Wuhao."

Thereupon, Emperor Wu sighed: "Alas! If I could but reach the Yellow Emperor’s attainment, I would cast aside the world as dust."

The Emperor then sacrificed at the Yellow Emperor’s tomb on Mount Qiao. Turning to Gongsun Qing, he asked: "The Yellow Emperor became an immortal yet did not die—why then does he have a tomb?"

Qing replied: "When the Yellow Emperor ascended as an immortal, his ministers longed for him endlessly. Thus, they buried his robes and cap—it is not a true tomb."

Emperor Wu sighed again: "When I ascend to heaven hereafter, will my ministers also long for me, holding my robes and cap to bury them at Dongling?"

Lu Nüsheng was a native of Changle. From youth, she cultivated the Dao, first consuming sesame and water, abstaining from grains for over eighty years. Day by day, she grew younger and more radiant, her complexion like peach blossoms. In a single day, she could travel three hundred *li*, running as swiftly as a deer. The world has transmitted accounts of her for over three hundred years."

Later, she gathered herbs on Mount Songgao when she suddenly saw a woman sitting in a mountain stream. Knowing she was a divine being, Nüsheng knelt, bowed twice, and kowtowed, begging for the essentials of longevity. After a long while, the woman said: "I am an attendant official of the Supreme One of the Three Heavens. You are destined for immortality, which is why you may see me. I shall now transmit to you the secret essentials of the *Precious Writ*, with which you may command the Five Peaks and dispatch the multitude of spirits." Thereupon she produced the *True Forms of the Five Peaks Chart* and gave it to her, along with instructions on its application and regulations. Nüsheng achieved the Dao, and one day she bid farewell to her kin and acquaintances, saying she was entering Mount Hua. Fifty years later, those who had known her before encountered her before the shrine of Mount Hua—her complexion had grown even younger. She rode a white deer, accompanied by thirty jade maidens, and sent clear greetings to her hometown kin and acquaintances.

Is the *Chart of the Five Peaks* identical to the *Writ of the Queen Mother*? Those seen in the world today—could they not have descended from Li Shaojun, Dong Zhongshu, and Nüsheng? Before his departure, Zhongshu transmitted it to Yue Ba; initially, Nüsheng transmitted the chart to Ji Zixun, who later passed it to Feng Junda. Before entering Dark Mound Mountain, Junda transmitted it to Zuo Yuanfang. Feng Junda was a native of Longxi. From youth, he cultivated the Dao, first consuming *huanglian* for over fifty years, then entering Wushu Mountain. There, he refined mercury for over a hundred years before returning to his hometown, his age appearing no more than thirty. He often rode a black ox, hence his sobriquet, the Black Ox Daoist. Whenever he heard of someone gravely ill or near death—whether he knew them or not—he would offer medicine from the bamboo tube at his waist. Sometimes he would administer acupuncture, and all recovered at his touch. Many in the world benefited from his efficacy, yet he never revealed his surname or given name. People only recognized him by his black ox, so they called him by that name.

Hearing that Nüsheng had obtained the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* from a perfected one, he sought it from her for years. Later, she granted it to him and fully instructed him in its regulations. Junda had already lived among people for over two hundred years before entering Dark Mound Mountain, after which his whereabouts became unknown. Before departing, he transmitted the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* to Zuo Yuanfang, who in turn passed it to Ge Xiaoxian.

The Black Ox Daoist received Nüsheng’s words: "In the household possessing the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, each peak dispatches five spirits to guard and protect the charts and writings. For those dwelling near mountains and rivers, the river and marsh spirits also send attendant officials to safeguard one’s person and household. If malevolent forces seek to harm you, they will instead suffer calamity. If conspirators plot against you, the five spirits will slay the instigator—all verified in dreams. Moreover, it averts the five pestilences of the five directions, as well as disasters of water and fire. One may tread upon blades unharmed. When the true forms are inwardly contemplated with utmost reverence—honoring them even more than one’s lord or father—every action should begin in a quiet place by burning incense and invoking the Lords of the Five Peaks. The Five Lords constantly record the Daoist’s virtuous deeds and also oversee their transgressions and impurities, as well as the unrighteousness of others. The unrighteous bring ruin upon themselves; the impure bring ruin upon their households. Thus, one must deeply guard against and be cautious of these.

When a Daoist carries this chart or holds it while traversing mountains and forests, the spirit-lords of all mountains and earthly sources emerge from their domains to bow in welcome, manifesting in radiant forms to guard, repel evil, and honor the sacred peaks. The reverence due to the peak-forms extends even to my person—ghosts and spirits still perform the rites of humble submission, so how could ordinary people dare treat them with disrespect?"

Li Shaojun, styled Yunyi, was a native of Linzi in Qi. From youth, he loved the Dao, entering Mount Tai to gather herbs and practicing grain abstention and reclusion to preserve his body. Before achieving the Dao, he fell gravely ill in the mountains. Master Anqi happened to pass by and, seeing Shaojun, struck his head and begged for life. Moved by his sincerity and pitying his illness, which would have led to death, Anqi gave him a spoonful of *Divine Tower Powder*. Shaojun immediately rose. Thereafter, he sought to follow Anqi as a servant and disciple. Anqi accepted and took him east to Red City, south to Luofu, north to Great Heng, and west to Jade Gate, roaming the Five Peaks and observing rivers and mountains for several decades.

One day, Anqi told him: "I have been summoned by the Dark Continent and must depart today. You should not follow me there yet. We shall part here. Six hundred years from now, I will welcome you at this place." He then transmitted the methods of divine elixirs, furnace fires, and flying mysteries, along with sworn oral instructions. In an instant, Anqi mounted a dragon-tiger, leading hundreds of attendants to welcome him. Anqi ascended to heaven in a feathered carriage.

Shaojun then returned to purify himself, selling goods in markets and trading across the six states. At times, he served as an official; at others, he practiced medicine or rented out his skills. He changed his surname and given name, traveling in places where none knew he possessed the Dao. By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, hearing the emperor recruited fangshi and revered Daoist arts, yet lacking the means to compound great elixirs, he sighed deeply and said to his disciples: "Old age approaches, death draws near, yet my resources are insufficient. If I till the land, labor, or trade for money, I will never succeed in compounding the elixir. Moreover, I am clumsy in such matters. I have heard the Son of Heaven loves the Dao and wish to see him, requesting to compound the cinnabar. If granted free rein, no desire will be unfulfilled. If the emperor’s intentions align, he will succeed; if not, I shall depart. I have lived in the world for over five hundred years yet have not gained even temporary power—surely I cannot escape becoming food for worms and ants."

Thus, he presented his arts to Emperor Wu, saying: "Your servant can congeal mercury into white silver, transmute cinnabar into flying elixir, and refine it into yellow gold. Consuming the gold grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight, endless immortality, the body sprouting crimson feathers of the sun, and wings of radiant light. Refined, one soars through the heavens; at rest, one enters the unseen. Riding flying dragons, the eight distant realms are traversed; driving white swans, the nine expanses are swiftly circumnavigated. The jujubes of the Dark Sea grow as large as gourds; the plums of Bell Mountain swell like jars. Your servant has already consumed them. Moreover, my former teacher, Master Anqi, transmitted oral instructions to me, ensuring the success of these yellow substances."

Upon this, Emperor Wu summoned him for an audience, showing him the utmost reverence and bestowing upon him countless gifts, even constructing a residence for him. The Emperor believed that he could surely enable him to transcend the mortal world. On one occasion, Shaojun attended a feast hosted by the Marquis of Wu’an, where an elderly man of over ninety sat among the guests. Shaojun remarked that he had once hunted with the old man’s grandfather, and the old man, recalling his childhood, confirmed that he had indeed accompanied his grandfather and recognized Shaojun. The entire assembly was astonished. Shaojun then noticed an ancient bronze vessel in Emperor Wu’s possession; upon gazing at it, he identified it, saying, "This was once displayed in the Wuqin Chamber by Duke Huan of Qi." The Emperor verified the inscription, and indeed, it was a relic of Duke Huan of Qi. Thus, it became clear that Shaojun was a man of several hundred years. Yet, he appeared no older than fifty, his complexion radiant, his skin smooth and lustrous, his brows, eyes, mouth, and teeth resembling those of a fifteen-year-old boy. When the feudal lords and nobles heard of his ability to grant immortality and restore youth to the aged, they sent him endless gifts of gold and money.

Shaojun secretly prepared an elixir of immortality, but before he could consume it, he approached the Emperor to request the *Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirit Flight Manuals*, comprising twelve scrolls in total. In the seventh month of the fourth year of the Yuanfeng era, the Emperor granted him these texts. By the ninth month of the sixth year of Yuanfeng, Shaojun claimed illness and submitted a memorial, stating: "Your Majesty’s thoughts are profound and wondrous, earnestly seeking longevity. Thus, you have summoned and attracted Daoist arts from afar, and none have failed to arrive. Truly, the spirits of heaven have descended in response. Yet, if one’s fate is not predestined, who could achieve harmony? However, the alchemical formulas are of grave importance, and one must abstain from the foul and the impure. The Dao of immortality nurtures all things, its benevolence extending even to the lowliest creatures. Yet Your Majesty cannot forsake extravagance, distance yourself from sensual pleasures, cease warfare, or temper your wrath. Across ten thousand li, souls remain unreturned; in the markets and courts, blood still flows. Under such conditions, the great elixir and the supreme Dao cannot be attained. Now, my illness grows with the years, and my feeble attempts at healing have failed. I have not been able to personally observe the fasts and purifications, nor witness the transformations of Pengzu’s cinnabar. Alas, this opportunity is lost. My former teacher, Master Anqi, once bestowed upon me a verified formula for the golden elixir. If one follows the regulations, upholds the precepts, and adheres to the prohibitions, only then may it be cultivated and employed. When the cinnabar smolders and the rainbow soars, when the ninefold cyclical transmutations of the mysterious and the vermilion unfold, when the Six-and-One is split and its essence flows to outshine the sun, when frost and snow are gathered and the moonlight is swept away by the wind—then, amidst the swirling crimson mists, the dragon and tiger seethe and boil. Lead and tin are cast in, and yellow gold is perfected; a knife-tip’s measure enters the throat, and the breath of decay is instantly reversed. Only then may one ride the divine rainbow to ascend, or drive the cloud chariot to traverse the distant realms. This formula’s divine efficacy will then be proven, and my humble words will be shown not to have been false."

He then presented the Emperor with a minor elixir formula, claiming his illness had worsened, though this was not the formula for the great elixir. That night, Emperor Wu dreamed that he and Shaojun ascended Mount Song together. Midway, an emissary in embroidered robes, riding a dragon and bearing a tally, descended from the clouds, announcing, "The Great One summons Shaojun." The Emperor awoke and immediately dispatched messengers to inquire after Shaojun’s condition. He told his close ministers, "As in my dream, Shaojun is about to leave me." The next day, Shaojun’s illness took a grave turn. The Emperor personally visited him and ordered his attendants to receive his alchemical texts, but before the transmission was complete, Shaojun passed away. The Emperor wept, saying, "Shaojun is not dead; he has merely departed in this manner." After his body was encoffined, it suddenly vanished from the casket. Only his outer garments and belt remained, untied, as if he had shed them like a cicada’s molted husk. Thus, they buried his clothing and belongings. Over a hundred days later, travelers reported seeing Shaojun in the market of Puyi in Hedong, riding a blue-gray mule. Upon hearing this, the Emperor had the coffin opened. Inside, there was nothing left—even the nails remained undisturbed—save for a single pair of shoes. The Emperor was deeply remorseful, regretting that he had not pursued Shaojun’s teachings more diligently. The following year, a fire at Liang Terrace destroyed many of the secret and wondrous texts.

Earlier, Shaojun had been close with the Gentleman-in-Attendance Dong Zhong. Seeing that Dong suffered from a chronic ailment, his body withered and his qi depleted, Shaojun gave him two doses of a completed medicine, along with a scroll detailing its formula. The ingredients included *wuji* grass, the essence of *houtu* (Earth’s fat), the marrow of the *gen* beast, the roots of *xianyou*, the nectar of a hundred flowers, and *longxian* grass. The elixir was to be prepared in the first ten days of the tenth month, decocted in a bronze cauldron, with boys and girls who had bathed and purified themselves regulating the fire. The medicine was to be formed into pellets the size of a parrot’s egg, with three taken per dose. After finishing the first dose, the body would feel lighter. After three doses, one’s teeth would fall out and regrow.

After completing five doses, Dong’s life was no longer in peril. Dong was a man of unyielding integrity, deeply learned in the Five Classics, yet he did not comprehend the arts of the Dao. He often mocked those who took elixirs or pursued the Way, repeatedly memorializing Emperor Wu to admonish him, arguing that human life was governed by fate, and aging followed its natural course—neither could be prolonged by Daoist arts. Though he witnessed Shaojun’s extraordinary abilities, he dismissed them as innate traits, not the result of any technique. When he received the medicine, he refused to take it and did not inquire further about its formula, merely storing it away.

Months after Shaojun’s departure, Dong fell gravely ill. Emperor Wu, too, repeatedly recounted dreams of him, lamenting the loss. Only then did Dong recall the medicine Shaojun had given him. He took some as a trial and, before even finishing half a dose, found himself able to walk. His body grew light and robust, and his ailments vanished entirely. Once the medicine was exhausted, his strength returned to what it had been in his thirties. Convinced at last that the world held a path to immortality, he resigned his post and traveled in search of Daoist masters. Though he could not fully grasp the principles of the formula, his white hair turned black again, and his appearance flourished. He lived to over eighty before dying. On his deathbed, he told his son Daosheng: “I obtained Shaojun’s divine formula, yet I failed to believe in its power—my regret will follow me to the Yellow Springs. You must seek out those versed in the arts and ask them to explain it. If you take this medicine for long, you will surely transcend this world.”

Moved by his father’s dying words, Daosheng refused to enter official service. Instead, he wandered the realm in search of someone who could decipher the formula. In Jiangxia, he encountered Master Boze, who said: “This is no divine elixir of gold or jade—it can only grant a few hundred years of life.” He then thoroughly explained the formula’s principles and the true names of its ingredients. Daosheng compounded the medicine and took it, living to the age of 370 before entering Jitou Mountain. It is unknown whether he ultimately attained the Dao.

Others who took the same medicine—Zhuo Yuancheng, Zhang Ziren, Wu Shisheng, Cai Zisheng, Wei Zhongming, and Zhang Yuanda—lived to three or five hundred years. None fell ill before death; their faces did not sag, their skin remained unwrinkled, their teeth did not fall out, their hair did not turn white, and their virility did not wane. If even this humble formula of Shaojun’s could achieve such effects, what might his superior elixirs have done?

Before his departure, Shaojun secretly transmitted the *Six Jia Left-and-Right Spirit-Flight Arts* and twelve other techniques to Shuai Guo Yan, while entrusting the *Divine Elixir of Flying Mystery* to his fellow townsman Ji Zixun. Both later studied the Dao and attained immortality. Shaojun also taught Zixun the *True Form of the Kunlun Divine Continent*.

Shuai Guo Yan, styled Gongyou, was a native of Shanyang. From youth, he was drawn to the Dao, and upon hearing of Li Shaojun’s mastery, he sought an audience, kowtowing and begging to serve as his attendant—handling his toiletries, sweeping, and other menial tasks. Shaojun granted his request. Observing Yan’s diligence and sincerity, he deemed him capable of success. As his departure neared, he secretly imparted the *Five Emperors’ Six Jia Left-and-Right Spirit-Flight Arts*, the *Twelve Methods of Roaming the Void and Summoning the True*, and said: “These, too, are essential arts of the Dao. Practice them carefully, and you may ascend to heaven.” After delivering the oral instructions, he sent Yan away.

Yan returned home and compounded the *Spirit-Flight Powder*, which enabled him to write at night. In his bedchamber, his body emitted a radiance that illuminated his surroundings. Practicing the *Six Jia Left-and-Right Arts*, he could divine the fortunes of the realm. Those destined to die—whether acquaintances or strangers—he knew in advance. He commanded ghosts and spirits, subdued tigers and leopards, and performed feats beyond measure. He lived in his hometown for four hundred years without aging. In the twenty-first year of *Jian’an* during the Han, one day dozens of men arrived riding tigers and leopards to welcome him. His neighbors all witnessed this. He bid farewell to his relatives and departed, saying he was bound for the Kunlun Terrace. Before leaving, he transmitted the *Divine Elixir Formula* and the *Five Emperors’ Spirit-Flight Secrets* to Master Yin.

Master Yin, whose given name was Gui and style name Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan. In the first year of *Yuanxi* of the Jin, he entered Taihe Mountain in Nanyang and passed on the essential arts to his disciple Shan Shiyuan of Henei.

Earlier, Yan had received Shaojun’s teachings and first transmitted the *Spirit-Flight Arts* to Ji Zixun, who also received the *Divine Elixir Canon*. Ji Liao, styled Zixun, was a native of Linzi in the Qi state and a townsman of Li Shaojun. In his youth, he served in local and provincial offices, was nominated as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate, and appointed Gentleman of the Palace. Later, he joined the military and was enfeoffed as Commandant of the Imperial Carriage.

Later, Ji Zixun realized that managing worldly affairs and holding office brought no benefit to one’s lifespan. He then studied medicine and healing arts under Shaojun. Over time, he witnessed Shaojun’s attainment of the Dao of immortality. Thereupon, he served Shaojun with the reverence due a master. Shaojun, seeing Zixun’s wholehearted devotion and recognizing his potential for accomplishment, gradually revealed to him the affairs of the Daoist school. He taught him the methods of *embryonic breathing*, *embryonic ingestion*, *abiding in years*, and *halting whiteness*. After practicing these for over two hundred years, Zixun’s complexion remained youthful.

In his hometown, he conducted himself with sincerity and deference toward others. Fond of tranquility, he often secluded himself to study the *Book of Changes* and occasionally composed short essays, all imbued with meaning. Later, Shaojun also transmitted to Zixun the great arts of transformation of Master Wuchangzi. When applied, these arts invariably proved effective.

Once, he saw a neighbor holding a child and asked to hold it. His grip slipped, and the child fell to the ground and died. The family, who had always held him in high regard, dared not show grief and buried the child, saying it was not fated to live. Days passed, and they gradually ceased thinking of it. Zixun then returned from outside, carrying the child back to the family. The family, fearing it was a ghost, begged him not to trouble them further. Zixun said, “Take the child—it feels no pain. It is truly yours.” The child recognized its mother, laughing and reaching for her. The mother took the child, though still uncertain. After Zixun departed, the father returned and together they dug up the grave. In the coffin, they found only a clay figurine of a child, about six inches long. The child then grew to maturity.

Moreover, when elderly people with entirely white hair sat with Zixun and conversed, by the next morning their hair would turn black—though he had done nothing to effect this. The blackening could be expected to last a year and two hundred days. There were also cases where he did not cause hair to turn black, for these were the greatest transformations of his divine arts.

When the nobles of the capital heard of this, none failed to earnestly desire an audience with Zixun, yet none could secure his presence. Zixun had lived in the capital for some years when a young man from his neighborhood became a student at the Imperial Academy. The nobles summoned the student and said to him, “You toil over your studies in hopes of passing the examinations and attaining wealth and rank. If you can bring Ji Zixun to us, we will ensure your success without effort.” The student agreed and returned home to serve Zixun, sweeping and cleaning for him morning and evening, standing by his side in attendance. This continued for nearly two hundred days.

Zixun said to the student, “You are no Daoist practitioner—how can you endure this?” The student replied, “Though I am but a humble man from our village, the way of respect between elder and younger demands no less.” Zixun said, “Why feign sincerity when your motives are false? I know full well your intent: the nobles wish to see me. Why should I begrudge the effort of a single journey and deny you honor and position?” He then instructed the student, “Return and tell them I will come on such-and-such a day.”

Overjoyed, the student went to the capital and relayed this to the nobles. On the appointed day, Zixun had not yet set out. The student’s parents grew anxious and went to check on their son. Zixun mocked them, “Do you fear I will not go? To keep your son’s word, I shall depart.” He left his residence at mealtime. The student’s parents said to each other, “Though Ji has not arrived on time, he is surely on his way.” The student returned home the next day and calculated the distance. Zixun had reached the capital by midday—impossible for an ordinary man to cover over a thousand *li* in half a day.

Upon arrival, the student went to see Zixun. Zixun asked, “Who wishes to see me?” The student replied, “Many wish to see you, Master. I dare not trouble you, but if I may know your whereabouts, they will come to you.” Zixun said, “There is no need for them to come. I have traveled over a thousand *li*—why should I now haggle with them over such matters? Today, have each of them dismiss their guests. I will arrive at midday and choose where to go first.”

The student relayed this to the nobles, who each prepared their homes. At midday, Zixun visited twenty-three households, yet there were twenty-three Zixuns, each appearing at a different place. The nobles were all delighted, each believing Zixun had come to them first. The next day, when they compared notes, they found that at the same time, each had hosted a Zixun—identical in clothing and appearance, yet their conversations varied according to each host’s questions.

Each household prepared wine and food to entertain Zixun, and he accepted their hospitality with full courtesy. The news spread far and wide, and the nobles all wished to visit him. Zixun said to the student, “They believe I must have extraordinary eyes and a radiant countenance, which is why they seek me. But I have nothing to teach. I will not go again.” With that, he departed.

As he left, the nobles’ carriages and retinues clogged the road. When they reached his door, the student said, “He just left, heading east. The one riding the blue mule is he.” They all galloped after him, but though they saw the mule ambling along, their horses could not catch up. After half a day’s pursuit, they remained about a *li* behind, unable to close the distance, and so they gave up and returned.

Zixun, being a fellow townsman and disciple of Shaojun, was discreet and meticulous, deeply pondering the profound mysteries of the Dao. Following and serving a master of illumination, he was on the verge of synthesizing the myriad wonders.

Wang Zhen, styled Shujian, was a native of Shangdang. In his youth, he served as a minor official in his commandery. At seventy, he took up the study of the Dao.

Seeking out various immortal scriptures and miscellaneous writings, he came upon an account of the Woodcutter of the Suburbs, a man of the suburbs during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou. As he gathered firewood, he sang this song:

*"Wrap in golden cloth,
Enter the Gate of Heaven,
Call the Long Spirit,
Chant to the Dark Spring,
Drum the Celestial Drum,
Nurture the Muddy Pellet."*

None of the people of his time could understand it, save the Archivist beneath the Pillars, who said: "This is a man who dwells within the living kingdom; his words are profound and hidden." The woodcutter was in truth an ancient fisherman.

How is this known? One who has lived eight hundred years has square pupils; one who has lived a thousand years has pupils with vertical patterns. The woodcutter was a man of a thousand years.

Zhen read this passage but could not fathom its meaning. He searched far and wide among Daoist masters, and after a year, he encountered one who could explain it. The master said to him: "This is but a shallow art, sufficient only to prolong life and restore youth." He then revealed the secret method:

*"Wrap in golden cloth"* means to constantly guide the qi of the lungs into the Muddy Pellet, circulating it slowly around the body, so that the body remains radiant and lustrous.

*"Chant to the Dark Spring"* means to rinse the mouth with saliva and swallow it, which prevents aging. Practicing this for seven days yields results.

*"Drum the Celestial Drum"* means to tap the teeth thirty-six times each morning upon rising, which calms the spirits of the body.

At night, one must visualize a crimson qi entering through the Gate of Heaven, suffusing the body inside and out. Within the brain, it transforms into fire, refining the body until it shines with the same light as the fire. This visualization is called *"refining the form."*

The Muddy Pellet is the brain; the Gate of Heaven is the mouth. Practicing breath-holding and swallowing is called *"embryonic breathing."* Swishing the spring beneath the tongue and swallowing it is called *"embryonic nourishment."* These practices must never cease.

Zhen received the method and diligently practiced embryonic breathing, embryonic nourishment, and the refinement of the form. The results were remarkable. He abstained from grains for over two hundred years, yet his complexion remained full and fair. He could walk at a leisurely pace and keep up with a galloping horse, and his strength equaled that of several men. He sighed and said: "Though this art may keep me from death, how can it compare to the methods of divine elixirs, gold, and jade?"

He then became a disciple of Ji Zixun, who taught him the *"Prescriptions Behind the Elbow."* When Emperor Wu of Wei heard of him, he summoned Zhen for an audience. The emperor saw that he appeared no older than thirty and suspected deception. He verified his origins with his fellow townsmen, who all spoke with one voice—many had known Zhen since their youth. Convinced of his mastery of the Dao, the emperor held him in great esteem.

Bu Mengjie became Zhen’s disciple for over a decade. Zhen taught him the methods of steaming cinnabar and minor elixirs, enabling him to transcend the mortal world. His hometown reckoned that Zhen had lived four hundred years. One day, he ascended Mount Nüji with three young concubines and told his disciples he was going to compound the elixir. He never returned.

Zhen could walk three hundred *li* in a single day. Mengjie could sustain himself by holding a date pit in his mouth without eating, and after ten years, he could hold his breath without exhaling, remaining motionless like a corpse for a hundred days or even half a year. He also had a family. This method was the same as that practiced by the Woodcutter of the Suburbs.

Mengjie was a man of integrity, cautious and sparing with his words. Emperor Wu of Wei built him a thatched cottage and appointed him to oversee all masters of esoteric arts. During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai of Jin, there were still reports of Mengjie being seen in the markets of Chang’an.

Emperor Wu of Wei was also diligent in seeking out masters of esoteric arts and Daoist practitioners, receiving them with an open mind. Yet none of those who had attained the Dao were willing to reveal their essential teachings.

Liu Jing, styled Taixuan, was a native of Nanyang and had served as a Gentleman-in-Attendance to Emperor Wen of Han. Later, he abandoned worldly life to study the Dao under Zhang Jun of E, receiving the method of the *"Cinnabar-Essence Pill."* After compounding and consuming it, he lived to one hundred thirty years, yet appeared no older than thirty. He later became a disciple of Ji Zixun, who taught him the *"Five Emperors’ Numinous Flight of the Six Jia and Twelve Arts,"* the *"True Forms of the Ten Divine Isles,"* and other secret essentials. Jing practiced these methods according to the instructions, and they proved highly effective. He could command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain, conjure traveling kitchens, and sit or stand at will. He could also foretell the fortunes and lifespans of others, and perform rituals to extend their lives by ten years—those who died at the appointed time had all been fated to do so. Even those who did not believe him would die at the predicted time.

Jing wandered among the famous mountains and the Five Peaks, traveling alongside Wang Zhen until they had visited them all. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei, he still visited the homes of his disciples. Huangfu Long, hearing of his mastery of the Dao, became his follower. Jing taught him the *"Ninefold Cloud-Mother Pill"* and two methods of *"the Way of Union."* Long practiced and consumed them according to the instructions, and his complexion and vitality grew ever more youthful. His hair did not turn white, nor did his teeth fall out. Though he lived over three hundred years, it was unclear whether he had achieved transcendence.

In the third year of the Huangchu era of Wei, Jing entered Mount Heng and was never seen again. He told Huangfu Long: "The essentials of cultivating the body lie in swallowing the Jade Spring every morning, which strengthens the body, enhances one’s complexion, expels the Three Worms, and fortifies the teeth. The Jade Spring is the saliva in the mouth. Before rising in the morning, rinse the mouth with saliva until it fills, then swallow it. Tap the teeth thirty-four times, repeating this three times before stopping. This is called *refining the essence* and grants longevity.

The Way of Union is most difficult; only superior gentlemen can practice it. It is as perilous as riding a galloping ox or a startled horse. Your nature is prone to excess—might this serve as a warning for you?" Jing feared that Long would not achieve transcendence.

Here ends the *Outer Traditions of Emperor Wu of Han.*
