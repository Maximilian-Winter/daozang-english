**The Record of Master Dong of Ningyang’s Encounter with Immortals**
Compiled by Lu Zhaowen

The Master’s family hailed from Long’an. His original surname was Muhu, though he was commonly known as the Dong clan. His personal name was Shouzhi, courtesy name Kuanfu, and Daoist appellation Ningyangzi. By lineage, he was a Jurchen. His father never held office, and his mother passed early. He married a woman of the Xilie clan, who bore him one son and two daughters. As his ancestors had served in official posts in the Shaanxi region, he settled in the Zhongnan Mountains. In the *gengzi* year of the Dading era, a nighttime decree from the prefecture summoned him for military conscription. Later, he was appointed as a *mouke* (company commander) and transferred to defend Woyang Garrison in Longzhou, where he established his household.

The Master was of simple and sincere disposition, his bearing majestic. From childhood, he was profoundly filial; in adulthood, he stood apart from worldly customs. Though enlisted in the military, his conduct and deeds surpassed his peers. He yearned for the mystic Dao yet lacked the means to practice it. Moved by his encounters with the Three Divine Immortals—Zhengyang, Chunyang, and Haichan—who discerned his eons of cultivation and repeatedly manifested to guide him, they clarified his past causes, earnestly enlightened him, and even afflicted him with illness to disrupt his official duties, leading to his dismissal from military service. Thus, the Master devoted himself wholeheartedly to the teachings.

Thereafter, his ailment did not abate. The Supreme Immortals bestowed upon him the *daogui* (medicinal spoon) and sealed his hidden afflictions. They conferred the Iron Horse Star Seal, commanding him to wield it, and granted him the power of talismanic water and medicine to aid the world. They left poems to exhort him, offered wine to console him, tested his conduct, prodded his shortcomings, descended to his hermitage, or met him upon the road. In broad daylight, they appeared before him with such clarity—never had his encounters with the divine been so intimate.

Since his meeting with the Perfected Ones, the Master abandoned secular life, left home, and built a hermitage to cultivate his resolve. He wandered between Deshun, Qin, and Long, ever awakening to deeper truths. Wherever he lodged, he followed the conditions of his practice, and many came to believe in him. When supplicants sought medicine, it descended; when he healed the sick, they recovered. His words summoned thunder, and his prayers brought rain. He projected his spirit into dreams, manifesting as an emanation body. For all who harbored thoughts—whether good or ill—he knew them in advance. His insights flowed into songs and poems, his utterances astonishing yet free of worldly artifice.

The Perfected One was born on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month in the *gengchen* year of the Zhenglong era. In the *gengzi* year of the Dading era, he was registered in the military rolls. On the first day of the ninth month in the *yimao* year of the Mingchang era, he was dispatched to the southern fortress of Deshun Prefecture. On the eleventh day at the hour of *chen*, as he dined with his company, he suddenly saw a divine being—tall of stature, nearly eight *chi*, his hair bound in two topknots, his complexion deep crimson, his beard and whiskers thick and fine. Clad in a blue robe and straw sandals, he bore a sword and strode to the gate, calling out: *"I have concealed you within the army, so I have come to receive you. Why do you not depart?"*

The Perfected One started in alarm and fell from his bed, losing consciousness at once. The others lifted and supported him. For seven days, he remained in a stupor, his limbs unable to bend or stretch. The fortress commander reported his condition to the headquarters, where officials and physicians examined him and diagnosed paralysis. Thus, he was granted an extended leave and returned to his hometown in Woyang to seek treatment.

On the third day of the third month in the *bingchen* year of the Cheng’an era, at the hour of *wei*, he again saw the divine being—this time in a white robe—standing at his door. The figure pointed at him and laughed heartily. The Perfected One rose from his outer couch to pay homage, but the being vanished in an instant. He asked his family: *"That divine being who came—do you recognize him?"* They replied: *"We do not."* The Perfected One then instructed them: *"Tonight, sweep and purify the house thoroughly. Perhaps the divine being will descend again to save my life."* His family did as he said.

On the fifteenth day of that month, at midnight, the divine being descended once more. Light filled the room as bright as day, and a strange fragrance permeated the air. Standing before him, the being said: *"Because you failed to awaken, you fell gravely ill. I have come especially to save you."* From his怀中, he took three pellets of elixir and placed them to stabilize his three *hun*; seven doses of medicine to settle his seven *po*. He instructed: *"Take this to dispel all perverse *qi*. Your body will burn like fire—do not be alarmed."* With that, he vanished.

After consuming the elixir and medicine, the Perfected One’s illness was indeed cured. On the twenty-seventh day at the hour of *wu*, the divine being reappeared. Overjoyed, the Perfected One bowed in gratitude. The being asked: *"Do you recognize Zhong?"* The Perfected One replied: *"I do. Every temple and abbey has one."* The divine being laughed: *"You only know the bell that is struck, but not whence its sound comes. I am Han Zhongli. For generations, you have cultivated the Dao, yet your merit remains incomplete. I have come to bestow upon you an iron horse—keep it with you always and do not discard it lightly. This year, the *qi* of the times will bring widespread pestilence. I also grant you dharma-water and talismanic medicine to save others. Once your merit is fulfilled, you may burn incense each dawn to summon medicine, and I will descend it to you."*

The Perfected One followed his instructions, and the medicine indeed descended from the void. All who were ill and took it recovered. Whenever he summoned the medicine, the divine being often appeared in the sky, and those who prayed with utmost sincerity also witnessed him.

The Perfected One, when drawing dharma-water, always drank first before administering it to others. He drank copiously each day, though none could fathom the quantity. Those who encountered him by chance were invariably enlightened by his words.

On New Year’s Day in the *dingchou* year, he saw a strange figure—a tall man with a sallow face, his hair unkempt, his feet bare, his body covered in matted hair, a hemp rope tied at his waist. He carried his hands on his shoulders, walked with his face upturned, and begged in the marketplace, crying: *"Alms of a single coin!"* To those who gave him two, he said: *"A beggar asks for but one coin—why give two?"* After receiving the money, he pointed and sighed: *"You have eyes, yet it took these four words to make me wait a whole day for you."* With the coins, he bought meat, wrapped the meat and any remaining money in paper, and carried it to the riverbank. There, he scooped sand with his hands, buried the wrapped meat, and piled the earth into a mound. He planted a branch atop it, hung paper money upon it, and placed dates and pears beside it. Then, sitting with his hands on his shoulders, he waited until a crowd gathered. Pointing, he said: *"Call for dates and pears! How will you date after this? How will you pear after this?"* With that, he plunged his hands into the earth, digging up the buried meat, and scattered it forcefully, crying: *"No dates, no pears—just wait and see!"*

For months, he wandered in this manner, and the people called him the *"Hands-on-Shoulders Master."* Whenever he met the Perfected One, they spoke of cultivating the Dao, using every metaphor to urge him toward leaving the household life. The Perfected One grasped his meaning and said: *"This disciple wishes to follow you."* The master replied: *"You are not yet ready to go. When the time comes, I will take you."* The Perfected One asked: *"May I know your dharma-name?"* The master said: *"I am Huangmian Liu."* *"And where are you from?"* *"Yincheng in Xiezhou."* When asked about his practice, the master demanded paper and wrote:

*"When the Three Corpses are slain by water,
Gaze westward as it flows to Yangzhou.
When weary, it’s best to withdraw your head."*

*"One word holds spirit,
One spirit holds words.
If spirit and words are not trusted,
Can man be so?"*

*"Words disregard form,
Once spoken, they cannot be recalled."*

When essence is stabilized, qi is stabilized; when qi is stabilized, spirit abides. When essence, qi, and spirit gather without scattering, this is true daily practice. He also left a verse:

*"Coming—no cultivation, no form or substance.
Going—no cultivation, no form or substance.
Within it, seize the pivot of creation’s mechanism;
Only when weary is non-action truly possible."*

The Perfected One deeply marveled at his words.

From then on, the master departed, and the Perfected One often thought of him. In the eighth month, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Perfected One competed with others in archery, drinking and feasting to excess, and his illness flared up again. In the tenth month, an official summons from Longzhou arrived for inspection, but due to his grave condition, he was removed from military records and no longer returned to his former seclusion. That very day, he was carried by litter directly to the White Slope Hermitage. After barely half a year, medical treatments proved ineffective.

On his birthday in the final month of winter, he reproached himself: *"I suffer deeply from this illness—have the sages sent this punishment? When will I recover?"* On the New Year’s Day of the *Chengan* *wuwu* year, he suddenly heard a voice from the void: *"Having returned to the Dao, how dare you still consume wine and meat? Your illness stems precisely from this."* Upon hearing these words, the Perfected One vowed to reform and swore never again to violate the highest precepts.

At noon on the seventh day, a master appeared—yellow-faced, with a black headscarf and long beard, clad in a hempen robe and straw sandals, carrying a double load on a pole. He asked: *"What ailment afflicts you?"* The Perfected One told him of the pain in his waist and knees, rendering him unable to walk. The master asked how long he had suffered, and the Perfected One replied: *"Nearly half a year."* The master said: *"I will apply acupuncture now. By midnight tonight, you will be cured—otherwise, it will not be so."*

He helped the Perfected One sit, leaning against his knee, then palpated the points and applied the needles: first at *Tianmen*, then *Baihui*, two needles at *Hegu*, and two at *Yongquan*. After needling, the master prepared to leave, but the Perfected One asked his name. He replied: *"Liu."* Though urged to stay the night, the master refused. At midnight, a clap of thunder resounded, and the Perfected One started awake—his waist and knees were limber, the illness as if plucked away.

That night, heavy snow fell until dawn. Overjoyed, the Perfected One swept the snow and went to a neighboring hermitage, where all were astonished. They knew he had encountered the healing power of a perfected immortal.

On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the *Chengan gengshen* year, while residing at a hermitage in Woyang, he suddenly met the divine being from before. The Perfected One quickly knelt before him, and the immortal said: *"Because you failed to awaken, I first bestowed upon you the Iron Horse. Now, I grant you the Seven-Star Treasure Seal—use it for your cultivation. The seal and horse are primordial objects, the Seven-Star Wisdom Sword. Cultivate according to the method, and I will guide you further. Do not leak this secret—remember, remember!"*

The Perfected One bowed in gratitude and looked up, but the immortal had vanished.

On the seventeenth day of the first month of winter in the *Taihe renxu* year, at the hour of *yin*, he suddenly heard a voice descending from the void, saying: *"We shall meet at Sanhekou."* The Perfected One hurried forward in alarm. Arriving at the southern bank of the ravine at Xuchuan Stream, he saw two divine beings already seated upon a boulder—none other than Immortals Zhong and Lü. The Perfected One knelt before them in reverence. Immortal Zhong said: *"Your body is thick with filth and grease—why not enter the water and wash it clean?"* The Perfected One replied: *"As you command."* The immortal then pointed to a great fish in the water and asked: *"Can you catch it?"* The Perfected One waded upstream and grappled with it, but the fish eluded him. The immortal next pointed to a large turtle and said: *"Can you mount its back?"* The Perfected One strained to climb upon it, but could not. The two immortals clapped their hands and laughed: *"You cannot even catch a fish or mount a turtle—wait until you have washed away your filth and can seize them. Then I shall guide you further. Now look to the southwest."* As he raised his gaze, the two immortals vanished in an instant. He emerged from the water, dressed, and bowed toward the heavens in gratitude before returning to his hermitage. Upon arrival, he felt his entire body suffused with searing heat, which persisted for ten days. Each morning, he bathed in the Three Rivers, and soon he no longer needed to eat. He sensed a profound awakening in his heart and often fell into silent reverence for the immortals.

In the *guihai* year, though the Perfected One had entered the Dao, his family ties remained. His wife, Lady Xilie, witnessed his extraordinary encounters with the immortals and, moved by devotion, relinquished her attachments so that he might formally take monastic vows under a master. On the night of the fifteenth day of the second month in the *yichou* year, Immortal Zhong descended into his earthen chamber. Divine radiance illuminated the room, bright as daylight. The Perfected One knelt before him, and the immortal instructed: *"Do not dispense medicine to others, lest you endanger their lives and diminish your own merit. When Lü and I met you at Sanhekou and bade you wash your filth and seize the fish and turtle, did you grasp the meaning?"* The Perfected One replied: *"No."* The immortal said: *"The filth and grease are the impurities of the heart; the fish and turtle are your nature and life. In cultivation, one must only eliminate defilement and still the mind. When the spirit-terrace is empty, nature and life will naturally unite. Refine the Golden Elixir, shed the mortal husk, ascend in flight, and roam the celestial palaces—remember this well."* He then left a verse on the practice of alchemy:

*"I urge you to practice alchemy—
Yet it profits not the heart.
To save others while neglecting yourself,
Is to lose sight of your own path.
Though you may heal, and all call you good,
If resentment arises, the debt spans lifetimes.
Such alchemy—how can it not grieve?
Ponder deeply, yet the scriptures remain unread.
I now counsel you:
Alchemy wearies the spirit.
If you disobey, you shall sink forever.
Shun sound and form, let go of right and wrong.
I urge you again: do not indulge in greed or wrath.
One day, this old frame will crumble—
When will you attain liberation?
Cherish your qi, nurture your spirit,
Root yourself deeply.
Correct your faults, return to truth,
And all past karma shall dissolve.
Abide in purity and non-action,
And merge with the Dao in reality.
Receive others’ offerings with a single mind,
Devoted to the Way.
If you do not advance, ten thousand calamities shall befall.
I now reveal the secret—awaken and remember:
When nature rests and life abides,
You shall soar lightly through the heavens.
If you do not reform, one mistake is eternal.
Follow this path in cultivation,
And I shall guide you further."*

He then took a small gourd, poured wine, and offered it to the Perfected One. After drinking, he fell into a profound trance, remaining insensible for seven days before gradually awakening. He saw that the ritual implements in the earthen chamber had turned to ash, and the room was filled with an unceasingly fragrant aroma. From that moment onward, he attained sudden enlightenment.

On the morning of the Lantern Festival in the *Da’an jisi* year, while in Woyang, he suddenly heard a voice descending from the void: *"Your karmic affinity lies with De Shun—remember this well."* The Perfected One rushed out to pay homage, but saw nothing. On the twenty-fifth day of the second month, he traveled to Shunde to persuade his disciple Lu Ziran to leave the household life. Upon meeting, their words aligned as if by divine accord.

In the *gengwu* year, De Shun established a hermitage. On the seventh day of the second month of winter, as night deepened, the Perfected One strolled through the front courtyard, gazing at the celestial patterns. Suddenly, two immortals passed by on a cloud of radiant hues. Startled, he changed his robes, lit incense, and saw the Supreme Yang Immortal in a green robe and straw sandals, accompanied by another immortal with a yellow complexion, a fine beard, a black headscarf, and crimson garments. The Supreme Yang supported the other immortal’s right shoulder as they stood beneath a great apricot tree. A glow dazzled his eyes, and a fragrant breeze caressed him. The Perfected One knelt in reverence. The Supreme Yang Immortal said: *"When you were in Woyang, a man with a hunched shoulder appeared to you. For months, you did not awaken—who did you take him for?"* The Perfected One replied: *"At the time, he claimed to be Liu of Huangmian in Jiezhou."* The Supreme Yang pointed and laughed: *"That was none other than Lord Haichan. Later, at Baipo Hermitage, another master sealed a method for you, curing your illness—he, too, was Lord Haichan. In a past life, you were also a cultivator of the Dao. Haichan and I once guided you and bestowed upon you the Daoist name Ningyangzi and the Dharma name Yu Zhen. Today, Haichan and I have returned to clarify your past causes and restore your former titles, adding the name Helao Laoren and the Dharma name Shouzhi. We now teach you the Threefold Unity, the method of inverting water and fire, the art of refining the Golden Elixir and returning the cinnabar, the secret of the Yellow Sprout’s desiccation and mercury’s immobility, and the way of mercury and lead congealing, spirit and qi uniting."* He then recited a poem:

*"Preserve the spirit, nurture the qi, and the body is at peace;
Mercury congeals, lead solidifies, and all is natural.
Transcending the mundane, entering the sacred, beyond the world—
Why fear not becoming a Great Luo Immortal?"*

He continued: *"I once bestowed upon you the Iron Horse and the Seven-Star Treasure Seal, yet you still did not awaken. Now I shall explain: long ago, I transmitted the sword method to Dongbin and bade him cultivate with it. Today, I pass the Iron Horse and Star Seal to you—equal to Dongbin’s."*

He then composed two gnomic verses. The first read:

*"The Seven-Star Treasure Seal now holds true sway,
Its radiance once more illumines the boundless realm.
The Iron Horse repels evil as a sword might,
While tortoise and serpent coil in mutual embrace."*

The second verse went:

*"Seven times I have raised you from profoundest folly,
Though hoary-haired and aged, you surpass the wise.
Should you tarry and descend to the Yellow Springs,
The human form once lost will never be regained."*

The Immortal of Sea-Toad also left a verse:

*"In former lives, a poor man known as Sea-Toad,
Now I reveal the causes of past karmic threads.
Had I not cultivated through kalpas untold,
Who would repeatedly lift the worthy from their depths?"*

He then presented a long five-character poem:

*"Now I speak of the Great Dao,
Rare are those who walk its ancient Way.
Secure the mercury gourd well,
Lest it be stolen by thieves unseen.
In purity and true non-action,
Not even a mote of dust disturbs.
A single speck of black cloud gone,
The bright moon shines in crystalline clarity.
Seal the mouth, guard the tongue,
Sweep clean the six senses.
The black turtle of the Northern Sea,
The red serpent of the Southern Mountain entwine.
Within the grotto, snowflakes drift,
The crucible and furnace shape themselves.
Refine the priceless treasure,
Together we shall ascend to Penglai Isle."*

*"This is the secret formula of true cultivation—do not hoard it for yourself alone. You also have several disciples, who were your dharma kin in past lives. Once, on Mount Wannu, you established a hermitage at the Cave of Ascended Perfection, naming it the Congealed Yang Abode, and kept company with Master Tongxuan, Chen Xindao. Now, disciples such as Gushenzi Ma Shanneng follow you in cultivation. The Cave of Ascended Perfection was where the Immortal Zhang Guolao once concealed himself. Master Tongxuan is now known as Bingyangzi Chen Zhihe. I now bestow upon them dharma names and titles. First, have them take vows, then transmit the teachings—only then may they cultivate. Remember this well; be cautious and vigilant."*

The Perfected One bowed in gratitude. Looking up, he saw the two immortals once more ascend upon colored clouds. Reflecting upon the immortals’ words about his past lives, he suddenly attained profound awakening.

In the year *xinwei*, he traveled to Dezhen Hermitage, where fellow Daoists, hearing rumbling like thunder from within his abdomen, marveled. They requested two quatrains to share with the assembly.

On the twenty-sixth day of the second lunar month in the *guiyou* year of the Chongqing reign, he journeyed to Woyang with his master-uncle, Master Chen. As dusk fell and yellow dust obscured the sky, they arrived at Liujiang Gorge and suddenly encountered the two immortals—Zhengyang and Haichan—each standing astride a spotted deer. The Perfected One prostrated himself. Zhengyang said: *"I previously imparted to you the secret formulas of true cultivation, but the events of that night were chaotic, and I feared you did not fully grasp them. Now I remind you again: exhort all men and women to return to the Dao and their original nature. Refine the Great Elixir, nurture the qi of harmonious equilibrium, and employ true Water and true Fire. Let mercury and lead congeal, and through refinement, form the Elixir. If you do not settle the mind and stabilize intention, calm the qi and nourish the spirit, how can you escape the suffering of the turning wheel? Do not stir up waves or kindle the fires of desire. Anger weakens the spirit; wrath scatters the qi. When qi scatters, the person perishes; when the person perishes, they become a lowly ghost—when will their release come?*

*The* Yin Fu Jing *states: ‘Fire is born from wood, and calamity inevitably follows. Treachery arises in the state, and when the time comes, it collapses.’ One who knows this and cultivates is called a sage. When a person gives rise to anger, fire is born, and desire arises. When desire arises, form and shadow vanish, and in darkness, unawares, the body is harmed. Do not indulge the Six Bandits or the Three Corpses. Instead, eradicate the restless steed, sever all entanglements. Lest you doubt: Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire—this is the law of the Five Phases’ mutual conquest. Yet Metal generates Water, Wood generates Fire—this is the earthly cycle’s natural progression, which entails birth and death. But when Water generates Metal and Fire generates Wood, this is the heavenly cycle’s reversal—how then can there be birth and death? In essence, the key to cultivation lies in nurturing the Metal within Water—this is the method of inverting the Five Phases. Should one meet me even once, for three lifetimes they will not fall into hell. Hereafter, it will be difficult to see me again—remember this well. If you leak celestial secrets or transmit them to the unworthy, misfortune will befall you, and punishment will surely follow. When you encounter one of sincere faith, first have them swear an oath before their ancestors, then you may transmit the teachings."*

The Perfected One bowed in gratitude and asked questions, but the two immortals had already ascended. Looking around, he saw another immortal standing among the pines and rocks of a sheer cliff. Just then, his master-uncle arrived. The Perfected One asked: *"Did you see the immortal among the rocks?"* His master-uncle replied: *"I saw nothing."* The Perfected One prayed with utmost devotion and bowed again. Then, indeed, he saw the immortal—clad in a black headscarf and crimson robe—appear among the pines and rocks. His sleeves fluttered in the wind as he strolled away along the winding path. Though the others gazed and bowed, they could not see him.

The master-uncle then returned to Dezhen. It was the middle of the fourth lunar month. In the *jiayou* year of the Zhenyou reign, the Perfected One traveled from Dezhen to Woyang. He set out on the fifteenth day of the ninth month and arrived in Longzhou on the eighteenth, lodging at the South Gate. Around the *wei* hour, he suddenly saw the immortal Zhengyang standing by the river. Zhengyang asked: *"Where are you going?"* The Perfected One hastily bowed and replied: *"This disciple’s kiln in Woyang has been seized by others. I have come to address this matter."* The immortal said: *"Is the kiln worth money? Is your life worth money? You recognize only the kiln but are blind to true emptiness, clinging to false emptiness. You still do not understand—you are falling into deluded emptiness."* The Perfected One asked: *"What is true emptiness?"* The immortal replied: *"True emptiness pervades and fills the void, unstained and unattached, with the singular spirit ever-present."* *"Do you recognize it?"* The Perfected One said: *"I do not."* The immortal exhaled a breath, and the Perfected One suddenly awakened. In an instant, the immortal vanished.

Arriving in Woyang, he was filled with trepidation and dared not speak of the matter he had come to address.

After more than a month, he returned to DeShun, where he encountered Daoist friends from Zhen’an, including Zhang Yilang. They asked: *"What is the meaning of the winter solstice, when the first yang begins to rise?"* The master composed a verse in response.

In the year *Dingyou* of the Zhenyou era, Wang Jinqing of DeShun invited the Perfected One to a vegetarian feast. Afterward, he escorted the master back to the hermitage. As dusk fell, Wang prepared to take his leave, but the Perfected One insisted he stay the night. *"Take my iron horse and place it in the upper chamber,"* the Perfected One instructed. *"If you hear thunder, do not be afraid."* Wang followed the master’s words precisely.

That night, as he sat dozing, suddenly a thunderclap shook the entire building, nearly uprooting the pillars. The household cried out in alarm, but Wang remained unmoved. When they lit a lamp to check on him, they saw that the fire had singed his beard and mustache. Only then did his family rouse him, and he slowly regained awareness.

The next day, the entire household prepared incense and flowers, carried the iron horse on their heads, and returned it to the hermitage. They recounted the events in detail. The Perfected One said: *"Yesterday, when the thunder struck, you did not awaken—do you understand the reason? There was a malevolent dragon hidden in the sword hanging on your chamber wall. The celestial thunder had come to seize it. If not for my iron horse, the outcome would have been different."* Wang returned home and examined the sword, finding the dragon’s traces scorched into the blade, which had burst from its scabbard and fled. Claw marks still remained on the chamber wall. The Perfected One manifested such transformations in response to circumstances, yet none could fathom them.

In the year *Bingzi*, the Perfected One returned to DeShun from the Luo River. Arriving at Shousheng Abbey, as he walked among the pines behind the hall, he suddenly encountered two immortals: Pure Yang and Hai Chan. They said: *"Throughout the four seas, I have taken the form of a beggar, exhorting people endlessly, yet none heed me. Their karmic obstructions run deep—bound by greed, jealousy, and harmful deeds. What can be done? What can be done?"* They recited a verse:

*"Daily I wander the four seas,
A beggar in the bustling streets each day.
Exhorting endlessly, yet none heed—
Wasting spirit in vain, blinded by worldly ties.
I urge you: life and death are grave,
Yet fools persist, bound by karma’s weight.
Unwilling to cultivate truth, they break heaven’s law,
Doomed to suffer in Dengdu for ages untold."*

After reciting, they charged the Perfected One with spreading their teachings to awaken others. Hai Chan added: *"We observe the deluded masses of the world, accumulating karma in myriad ways, yet scarcely one in ten thousand awakens. You must admonish men and women alike, guiding them toward the good Dao. Cultivate hidden virtue outwardly, and inwardly fortify your spirit. If your true nature remains unobscured by desire, your true heart will naturally align with the Dao of Heaven. This illusory body is but a temporary convergence of the four elements—why cling to it, why cherish it?"* He then transmitted a verse to the Perfected One:

*"Listen closely to my teachings,
I speak to my disciples—do not obscure your true heart.
If you fail to repay karmic debts,
You’ll enter the wheel of rebirth, your human form lost.
Hair turns gray—do not complain,
Nor cling to this mortal shell.
All that is composite must decay.
In leisure, refine the elixir’s platform,
And like Pure Yang, follow me to Penglai’s assembly."*

The Perfected One received the teachings, bowed in gratitude, and asked further questions. Suddenly, the two immortals vanished without a trace.

Thereafter, he diligently propagated the Daoist teachings, instructing people far and wide. Within a few years, the influence of the Dao flourished, and none failed to believe and follow.

In the year *Wuyin*, his disciples Lu Ziran and others wished to learn the origins of the *yin* and *horse* (seals and talismans). The master composed a song to explain.

On the twelfth night of the second lunar month in the year *Renshen* of the Yuanguang era, as the second watch began, the Perfected One sat in meditation when he heard a thunderous crash in the void. Startled, he rose and received a revelation: *"Your karmic causes now lie in Long Prefecture. This place is no longer where you should focus your heart—heed these words."* The Perfected One stepped into the front courtyard to observe, but saw nothing.

In the year *Guiwei*, Daoist friends from Longzhou invited the master to teach. The Perfected One manifested in response to circumstances, compassionately guiding the people. Those who revered the Dao from all directions listened with awe, and many came to admire him. Over a dozen hermitages were built in the surrounding area, the Daoist influence grew daily, and the lineage expanded greatly.

In the year *Yiyou* of the Zhengda era, a severe drought had persisted for a long time without rain. The people of Longzhou begged the master to bring rain. Moved by compassion for all living beings, the Perfected One entered deep stillness in the great void—and the rain came of its own accord.

In the year *Bingxu*, on the Festival of Upholding the Dao, he addressed his disciples: *"I have repeatedly taught you that the great matter of life and death requires urgent attention—cultivate the Dao and refine your true nature. Yet in the twelve hours of each day, not a single moment do you abide in the Dao. You have accepted offerings from all directions, squandering time in vain. In the future, how will you repay these karmic debts and endure the suffering? Every thought and intention must align with the heart of Heaven. All the virtuous people of the past possessed vast karmic blessings, naturally moving heaven, earth, and the divine. In essence, cultivation requires accumulating merit and virtue, refining the nature to achieve truth. Rest without distraction, unstained by the myriad conditions. Be truly pure, truly steadfast. Spirit and *qi* harmonize and ascend. Nature and life naturally guard one another. The great elixir naturally coalesces. When merit is complete and conduct perfected, you will become a sage. I will guide you to join me as companions—how much longer can this take?"*

The disciples, filled with reverence and trepidation, bowed in gratitude and withdrew.

On the first day of the tenth month in the *dinghai* year, Jie’an was given the name Yanghao. From the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day, auspicious clouds enveloped the hermitage, thunderclaps resounded several times, and a wondrous fragrance filled the sky—all witnessed and heard by those present. They burned incense and inquired, "What is the meaning of this?"

The Perfected One said, "The Patriarch has summoned me to a gathering at Penglai. I shall now return. When I first encountered the Supreme Immortal of Zhengyang, he bestowed upon me a seal and a steed, commanding me to cultivate the Dao. Today, I entrust the Iron Steed to Lu Ziran and the Seven-Star Jeweled Seal to Ma Shanneng. The two of you shall establish my teachings and serve as shepherds to the disciples, just as those who received the Dharma from me in the past. You must not treat this lightly or grow negligent."

Ziran and the others replied, "We have no merit or conduct to speak of and dare not presume to inherit this burden." They declined repeatedly, but when the Perfected One saw they would not accept, his countenance darkened, his gaze piercing the assembly. All were struck with awe and fear.

The Perfected One said, "Do you not consider my teaching lineage? How dare you refuse?" The two, weeping in sorrow, had no choice but to reverently accept.

The Perfected One then summoned all his disciples and commanded them to bow to Lingyangzi and Gushenzi. Afterward, he called for water to bathe. Once finished, he asked for his robes.

The Perfected One said, "There is no need for thick silk or padded garments. Plain, unlined cloth will suffice."

They replied, "But winter is cold—how can we bear such thin clothing?"

The Perfected One said, "What did I wear when I first came?" So he donned the simple robe and sat for a long while. Then he called for brush and ink and left three verses:

**First:**
*A Dharma-boat on land,*
*I’ve plied its oars for decades.*
*Now oar and boat cast aside—*
*My life obeys no heaven.*

**Second:**
*I possess the art of gathering spirit,*
*True fire refines cinnabar.*
*Formless, heartless,*
*Yet I know the Ancestor Ama.*

**Third:**
*Mastery of spirit, transformation endless,*
*Creation knows no bounds.*
*My life is mine alone—*
*Heaven and earth cannot contain it.*

After reciting the verses, he instructed his disciples, "After my departure, you should settle near the burial mound." As his words ended, at the *wei* hour, he sat upright and passed away.

This occurred on the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month in the *dinghai* year.

After his ascension to immortality, the times were beset by turmoil, and his remains were temporarily interred at Yanghao Hermitage in Dichun Village. Twelve years later, in the *wuxu* year, his disciples Lingyangzi, Lu Ziran, and others lamented the swift passage of time and the ever-receding memory of his voice and countenance. They journeyed from Qin across the Long Mountains to exhume and relocate his remains, personally constructing a tomb and hermitage. As they wandered in reverent contemplation, they beheld upon the northern cliff of the burial mound a propitious herb, its form resembling purple *zhi*, its branches and leaves spreading like a canopy, lush and dense, overshadowing the grave.

They ordered the tomb opened, and as it was breached, a sound like thunder resounded. When the coffin was lifted, they beheld him—his complexion as in life, his robes around him white as hoarfrost, an extraordinary fragrance filling the air. The inner lining of the coffin was adorned with rare flowers and herbs, as if carved or painted. All present marveled in awe.

The following day, they bore his remains in procession and reinterred him at the foot of Guishan beneath the Long Mountains. This took place on the thirteenth day of early summer.

The Perfected One was endowed with an extraordinary nature, his innate wisdom keen. Truly, he was a divine immortal. Having received the oral transmission and personal instruction of the Three Sages, he cast aside the habits of galloping steeds and wielding swords to devote himself to the cultivation of truth and the refinement of conduct. He shed the form of one who flees the dust of the world to undertake the transcendent act of entering sagehood.

Where once he knew not the boundless void, now his brush produced scripture. Where once he had never studied, now his words formed literature. His aspirations soared beyond ancient and modern, his phrasing subtly attuned to rhythm and rhyme. Even the most learned scholars and literary talents could not surpass him. For his attainment was profound, his cultivation perfected—sages and worthies aided him unbidden, and literary mastery came to him without study. How vastly different he was from those who pilfer from ancient texts!

His disciples Lingyangzi and others, having long received his direct instruction and witnessed his ways, compiled the master’s posthumous writings—poems, lyrics, songs, and hymns—into four sections, arranged as three volumes: *Upper*, *Middle*, and *Lower*. They titled the collection *Harmonizing with the Light*, and, unwilling to keep it private, had it printed for transmission to the world.

Additionally, they compiled a separate chronicle of the Perfected One’s life and encounters with immortals, titled *Record of Encountering Immortals*, which nearly captures the origins of his ascension and realization of the Dao, the beginnings and ends of his teachings for the world. With a single glance, all becomes clear.

Here ends *Record of Encountering Immortals: The Ascension of Perfected Dong of Ningyang*.
