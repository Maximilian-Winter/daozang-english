*To the Jade Emperor,*
Your subject [Name] humbly states: The Most High has deigned to regard us, aligning with impartiality; the mandate of heaven converges in prosperity, rightfully bestowed upon the virtuous. Profound blessings descend, and the illustrious title is augmented. Though I humbly bear this blessed favor, I am inwardly ashamed of my inadequacy.

I reflect that I was born to receive radiant blessings and to guard the established foundation. Relying on the gracious regard of the celestial realm and the counsels of my ancestors, I have striven in diligence day and night, ever mindful of the Three Luminaries. Though distant and near are roughly at peace, the perfect governance of the myriad things has not yet been attained. Now, as the verdant spring aligns with the auspicious yellow register, I have reverently followed the celestial mandate and adopted the counsel of the feng memorials. Not daring to exalt this grand occasion, I only sought to respond to the vast felicity. Yet, to my surprise, the gray-haired common folk and the assembled officials, in joint memorials, have added to the title. Overwhelmed by this excess of praise, I feel unworthy of such benevolence. Though I have repeatedly expressed my reluctance, the will of the people could not be denied.

Moreover, the name "Revering Heaven and Honoring the Dao" is fitting for this sacred service, and the intent of the "Precious Response and Manifest Blessings" truly accords with the descending auspices. Unable to persist in refusal, I have humbly accepted. Only after completing the sacrificial rites will the formal investiture be undertaken. Thus, I present this memorial to express my reverent devotion. Ever mindful of my inadequacy, I am increasingly overwhelmed. I humbly submit this memorial in gratitude. Your subject [Name], with profound gratitude and awe, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**Memorials for the Cessation of Warfare (Two Documents)**

*To the Jade Emperor,*
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Since inheriting the great mandate, I have ever been wary of the perils of warfare. Unless compelled to suppress bandits and disorder, I have never lightly resorted to arms. Reflecting on the founding of the preceding dynasties, when the central realm was not yet pacified, I have occasionally launched punitive expeditions, solely to relieve the people’s suffering. Now, as the heavens and earth regard us with favor and the written mandate extends without bounds, this decree has fallen to my humble person. Trembling with reverence, I am at a loss day and night. Thus, I humbly express my earnest plea and look up in gratitude to the vast numen. I pray that the august ancestors will manifest their protective aid and that blessings will descend upon my humble self. May my utmost sincerity be upheld, and may vast responses unfold without limit. Your subject, overwhelmed with gratitude and reverence, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and trepidation, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

*To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Honored Great Emperor,*
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Reverently inheriting the grand mandate, I have ever been cautious of warfare. If the frontiers were secure, I never took up arms in haste. Reflecting on the two dynasties’ founding, when the central lands were not yet at peace, I have occasionally launched punitive expeditions, solely to fulfill the people’s hopes.

Now, by the blessings of the numinous powers, all within the realm has achieved great unity. Yet, with this humble self, I have inherited this grand legacy. Inwardly, I tremble with awe, my heart overwhelmed. I dare to offer my utmost sincerity, humbly expressing my profound gratitude. I pray that felicitous omens may descend upon the Two August Emperors and that blessings may be bestowed upon this unworthy one. May my earnest devotion from the depths of my heart evoke a vast and boundless response. Your subject, overwhelmed with reverence and trepidation, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and trepidation, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**Two Memorials of Thanksgiving and Supplication to the August Jade Emperor**
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Reverently receiving the radiant mandate, I have continued the long-enduring legacy. The virtue of cherishing life has ever been bestowed by the lofty heavens; the reproach of reckless warfare, I dare not forget from ancient teachings. Whenever I have raised armies, it has been solely in response to enemies. Reflecting on the Two August Emperors, who governed the four quarters, I recall that before the people were unified, those in distress were promptly aided. Though I extended punitive expeditions with compassion, the cessation of warfare remained my true aim. The intent behind waging war was never for conquest but to relieve suffering. Now, as all domains are united under the protection of the Three Divine Powers, I reflect upon the wars not yet stilled and reproach myself in waking and dreaming. I humbly pray that blessings be bestowed upon the ancestral spirits and that pure felicity be granted to this unworthy one. My heartfelt devotion deepens with each passing day, and my ungoverning benevolence awaits the harmony of Heaven’s favor. Your subject, overwhelmed with reverence and trepidation, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and trepidation, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Honored Great Emperor,**
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Inwardly, I recognize my inadequacy, yet reverently continue the legacy of numinous blessings. Following the Dao of Heaven, I have ever prioritized the cherishing of life and the people; in wielding military power, I have sworn never to delight in war. Whenever I have raised armies, it has been solely in response to enemies. Reflecting on the founding of the ancestral dynasty, when the realm was not yet unified, I have followed the people’s hopes, launching punitive expeditions when necessary. Yet upon achieving victory, I have immediately embraced pacification. My intent has never aligned with the ways of war; my heart has only sought to rescue those in peril. Now, as the heavens above bestow their protection and the realm enjoys great peace, I reflect upon the wars not yet stilled and fear the indiscriminate suffering they may bring. Thus, with utmost sincerity, I humbly await your vast blessings. I pray that the Two August Emperors in the celestial realms may receive your favor and that this unworthy one, in continuing their legacy, may be sheltered. With all my heart, I offer my gratitude to the August Brilliance. May my earnest devotion, never forgotten in waking or dreaming, be acknowledged, and may your boundless blessings forever protect our land. Your subject, overwhelmed with reverence and trepidation, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and trepidation, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**A Memorial Praying for Rain**
To the August Jade Emperor,
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Disasters arise from human failings, yet where utmost sincerity reaches, the numinous heart is surely moved. I, who have inherited this grand mandate, am deeply ashamed of my lack of Dao, for though I strive with vigilance, I have not achieved peace. Considering the long delay of rain and the farmers’ dashed hopes, though I have repeatedly offered earnest prayers, I have yet to receive a response. In distress, I find no respite, and my pleas remain unanswered in waking or dreaming. The Three Luminaries warn of my virtue’s deficiency, and the failure of the nine grains weighs heavily upon the people. Thus, I renew my heartfelt supplication, humbly appealing to your august brilliance. I pray that the winds of strife may cease and the moon of the Dipper may linger. May vast rains flow, nourishing all life. Though I cut my nails in devotion, I have not faltered throughout the day; may even the slightest moisture bring relief to the great fields. Your subject, overwhelmed with reverence and trepidation, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and trepidation, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**Two Memorials of Thanksgiving for Rain**
To the August Jade Emperor,
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Untimely winds and rains arise from my own inadequacies, yet the heavens’ protection has brought about a response. I, who have inherited this blessed mandate, have not attained perfect governance. Flaws in administration and justice have led to drought as punishment. The people’s spring plowing is at risk, and my heart is filled with nightly vigilance. Thus, I have repeatedly offered earnest prayers, hoping to reach the numinous powers. Indeed, timely rains have come, sparing the fields from harm. This is surely due to your august regard and boundless grace. How could my meager virtue deserve such favor? Truly, all living beings share in this blessing. Now that the land is abundantly watered, I fulfill my humble prayers; through frugality and diligence, I deepen my reverence. May I never stray from this devotion and thus repay your watchful gaze. Your subject, overwhelmed with gratitude and reverence, humbly presents this memorial in thanksgiving.

I have heard that untimely winds and rains arise from my own inadequacies, yet the heavens’ protection has brought about a response. Your subject [Name], with profound joy and gratitude, bows twice, bows twice again. Reflecting upon my inheritance of this grand mandate, I have not attained perfect governance. Flaws in administration and justice have led to drought as punishment. Yet, with the first sign of my sincerity, sweet rains have been universally bestowed. This is surely due to your sagely compassion and boundless favor. How could my meager virtue deserve such grace? Truly, all living beings rejoice together. Witnessing the promise of abundant harvests, I delight in this auspicious sign across the realm. With renewed reverence, I strive to repay the gift of life.

To the August Jade Emperor,
Your subject [Name] humbly states: Recently, the scorching sun has brought calamity, and sweet rains have yet to fall. I fear harm to the crops and the failure of a good year. Gazing upon the vast heavens, I express my earnest devotion; looking down upon the great fields, I have received no response. I dare to renew my sincere plea, hoping to move the numinous heart. May vast rains come in harmony, fulfilling the hopes of the central fields. With accumulated reverence, I await your watchful protection.

I humbly pray that your luminous wisdom may perceive my earnest plea and bestow abundant blessings. May the scorching sun retreat, and may timely rains arrive.

To the August Ancestral Heavenly Venerable Great Emperor,
Your subject [Name] states: Since the arrival of spring, the rains have been deficient, and I deeply fear the failure of the harvest, which would leave the granaries empty. Though I have gazed toward the celestial realm in prayer, the great rains have yet to fall. Ashamed of my humble and inadequate virtue, my heart grows ever more vigilant.

Once more I pray to the Auspicious Spirit, devoutly hoping for its trustworthy protection. May its blessings descend upon us, that the abundant rains may harmonize all things. Having received the favor of dawn’s ascent, how dare I relax my vigilance by evening?

Your subject, overwhelmed with utmost devotion and earnest urgency, humbly presents this memorial in supplication. Your subject [Name], with profound awe and reverence, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

Furthermore,
Your subject [Name] states: Recently, the earthen tubes have signaled renewal, yet oily clouds remain scarce.

Though I have prayed to the Auspicious Spirit and gazed toward the heavens, the desired downpour has yet to arrive. I humbly beseech Your August Majesty to look upon my utmost sincerity and bestow a grand response. May these scattered rains nourish the central fields. My heart, day and night, trembles with reverence and finds no rest. May the purple clarity of Your grace shine forth, that my gratitude may be truly felt.

To the August Heaven,
Your subject [Name] states: Though the Most High deigns to look upon us with boundless benevolence, and though I, humble and unworthy, have inherited this foundation, how could I forget to repent for my faults?

I humbly reflect: In the depths of night, flames spread through the inner city. The fire prohibitions were neglected, and thus this calamity arose. Examining my governance, I find only fear and shame redoubled. Now, waking or sleeping, I am filled with dread, unable to compose myself. I dare to lay bare my sincerest thoughts, awaiting Your celestial scrutiny.

Your subject, overwhelmed with trembling awe and earnest urgency, humbly presents this memorial awaiting Your command. Your subject [Name], with utmost fear and reverence, bows twice, bows twice again, and humbly submits these words.

**A Memorial of Thanksgiving for the Bestowal of the Heavenly Script**
To the August Heaven,
Your subject [Name] states: I, who have inherited this blessed foundation, have received the noble mandate. On the radiant dawn of early spring, I accepted the auspicious talisman from the Great Emperor. Such divine favor has arrived in abundance, deepening my reverent awe.

Your subject [Name], with profound awe and fear, bows twice, bows twice again.

I humbly reflect: Though unworthy and of meager virtue, I have reverently upheld the ancestral temple. For twelve years now, I have borne the governance of the realm, and by Your grace, all lands have known peace. I have cherished the people as my own children, ever mindful of the august heavens. Yet I fear my governance has not inspired trust, and my virtue has not matched the Dao. I have constantly striven to improve, never daring to grow complacent. Who could have foreseen that the Azure Vault would store such blessings, and the Most High would deign to look upon me? At the beginning of this new year, You have bestowed upon me the sacred script. Its words extend ten generations of prosperity and teach the purity of governance. Overwhelmed by these admonitions, I prostrate myself in awe.

I dare not but reverently uphold this divine favor and humbly accept this pure gift. I shall devoutly follow the Great Central Dao to bring peace to all under heaven. I swear to redouble my diligence, that I may repay, if only in small measure, the boundless grace that covers me.

Your subject, with profound gratitude and fortune, bows twice, bows twice again.

I humbly reflect: Having inherited this established foundation, I govern these lands, yet my meager virtue has failed to shelter the people. Though I have striven in vigilance, what deeds of virtue or teaching have I offered? Yet, by the light of Your divine wisdom, peace has been achieved. When the sacred writ descended and the people’s pleas ascended, I ascended the lofty peak to answer the primal talisman. I offered the green jade and presented the yellow cong, my sincerity exhausted. I welcomed the hundred spirits and received the myriad states, yet my humility and unworthiness fill me with shame. How could I have hoped for clouds to rise over the sacred precincts? I still feared rain might fall upon the central slopes. Now, the golden edict is proclaimed, the jade is buried, and the grand rites are complete, with wondrous signs manifest. The six steeds of the imperial carriage did not lose their way in Xiangcheng; the seven guards returned to receive blessings in the Xuan Hall. Without the Most High’s protection, how could such fortune have been bestowed?

I shall strive to govern with diligence, cherishing the people as a father cherishes his children. May all things flourish in peace, that I may repay the august heavens.

I enhanced the illustrious names within the ancestral temple, expressing my filial devotion. By Your grace and protection, the ceremonies were executed with perfection. My desire to honor the distant past was fulfilled, and Your divine wisdom has deigned to look upon me.

I dare not but govern with reverent awe, ever mindful of diligent rule. May I secure peace for the myriad states and strive to correspond with the Three Luminaries.

**A Memorial of Thanksgiving for the Autumn Harvest**
To the Jade Emperor,
Your subject [Name] states: I have heard that all things are born and nurtured by the wondrous Dao, and the decrees of the Three Heavens are all received from the August Jade Emperor. Since Your blessings have been manifest, we have truly relied upon Your auspicious grace.

I, of meager virtue, have inherited this established foundation. With the people as my heart, I constantly seek to nurture and benefit them; if even one person lacks shelter, how dare I find rest? Thus, with fear and remorse in my heart, I have received Your unseen protection. Gazing toward the southern fields, the mid-autumn season has arrived. The fields stretch far, lush with ripening grain. Though I have warned against floods and droughts, the harvest is as abundant as a thatched roof or a beam—truly, the crops have flourished without flaw.

The abundant harvest indeed marks the beginning of a prosperous year, bringing peace to the multitudes beneath every roof. This is none other than the numinous power of the upright and luminous, who deign to bestow their gaze. Through the harmonious interaction of primal qi, such auspicious responses are made manifest. How dare I not tread cautiously, ever more vigilant, as one riding a galloping steed? Below, I humbly uphold the Dao of rulership; above, I strive to embody the benevolence of nurturing all beings. Overwhelmed by gratitude and awe, I respectfully submit this memorial in profound thanksgiving.

**Second Memorial: Thanksgiving for a Peaceful Year**

To the August Heaven,

Your servant humbly states: Of meager and benighted virtue, I have reverently inherited this blessed mandate. In awe of the Three Spirits, though I remain ever vigilant, I can but feel deep shame before Your luminous power. Yet You have graciously governed the myriad states, and now the Dipper’s handle has completed its celestial circuit, the spring of the Shang sacrifice has arrived, life flourishes in due season, and propitious qi converges. This is surely due to the numinous store of the Great Vault, whence the black-haired people gather blessings. How dare I not redouble my thoughts of purification, to repay Your watchful care? My sincerity, like that of one facing peril, has grown more earnest day and night; I pray that Your boundless protection may extend to all within the Four Seas, that they may forever enjoy stability. Overwhelmed by gratitude and awe, I respectfully submit this memorial in profound thanksgiving.

Previously, You deigned to bestow Your favor, granting precious talismans and inaugurating a new era, thereby proclaiming Your great response. Now, as the months complete their cycle, Your divine grace grows ever more abundant.

Now, as the four seasons complete their cycle, a thousand blessings converge in profusion. My heart, ever solemn and reverent, remains unwavering in waking and sleeping; I pray that Your luminous protection may continue to gather upon our homeland.

*Here end the fourth and fifth fascicles of the Imperial Compositions of the Jade Capital, by Emperor Zhenzong of Song.*

**Six Memorials of Thanksgiving**

**To Heaven**
I, Your servant, early partook of the sacrificial ale and thus ascended to inherit the ancestral legacy. Ever mindful of diligence and toil, I dare not indulge in ease or pleasure. As the seasons have advanced, peace has gradually been achieved. This is but the continuation of the blessings of my ancestors, whose merit I ever attribute to the boundless Heaven. Ascending Mount Tai in the east, I humbly submitted to the will of the people below. From Your exalted court, Your gracious regard has descended, and Your blessings have reached us. Auspicious omens have arrived without cease, and portents of fortune have been repeatedly bestowed. I can but look up in praise of Your radiant majesty, never forgetting the awe and vigilance due to You. Overwhelmed by reverence and gratitude, I respectfully submit this memorial.

**Again**
I, Your servant, have inherited this great enterprise and reverently serve the Highest Heaven. Though I toil ceaselessly in myriad affairs, never neglecting my duties day or night, the peace of the Eight Directions is truly the result of Your watchful gaze. Precious talismans have already manifested extraordinary signs, and the true mandate has once more proclaimed its glorious decree. Within myself, I feel my inadequacy and am all the more burdened by trembling reverence. Holding fast to my resolve to serve with utmost devotion, I can but hope to repay the bounty of Your lofty grace. Overwhelmed by reverence and gratitude, I respectfully submit this memorial.

**To the Jade Emperor**
I prostrate myself before the One whom the Three Realms revere as their sovereign, whom the Ten Directions look up to in worship—the Most High, whose position surpasses all perfected beings. Your existence transcends the immeasurable kalpas, and even the boldest names cannot encompass Your true nature. I, Your servant, have presumptuously received the sacred mandate and succeeded in governing the multitudes. I have been favored with Your gracious regard and enveloped in Your pure blessings. Deeply aware of this great fortune, which rests upon my humble person, I find no rest in sleep, so profound is my awe and trepidation. Overwhelmed by reverence and gratitude, I respectfully submit this memorial.

To the Source of Creation, all returns to the Great Dao; the foremost of the perfected immortals resides in the highest heavens. Wherever Your gracious protection extends, how dare I falter in reverence? Within, I am ashamed of my meager virtue, yet I have presumptuously inherited this blessed foundation. Though profound peace now prevails, my awe only deepens. My utmost sincerity is thus exhausted, and Your boundless favor descends. How could I not redouble my devotion, humbly heed Your sacred teachings, and forever strive to serve with clarity, that I might slightly repay Your regard?

I prostrate myself in utmost reverence and respectfully submit this memorial.

**To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Venerable Great Emperor**
I prostrate myself before the One whose exalted station reaches the nine heavens, whose position surpasses all sages. You extend the sacred mandate, bestowing it even upon this humble servant. When the five weapons were laid to rest, it was ever by the shelter of the Dao; when the myriad realms were pacified, it was truly by the grace of the Perfected Court. Though my constant reverence runs deep in virtue and teaching, how could I deserve such repeated blessings of fortune, such uninterrupted pure favor? Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, I can find no respite, and my trepidation only grows.

I prostrate myself in utmost reverence and respectfully submit this memorial.

**Dongyue Daigong Temple of the Three Clarities**

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Sacred Ancestor’s Descent (Two Petitions)**

**To the Jade Emperor**
I prostrate myself before the One who ascends the heavens without attainment, and thus is held as supreme; whose Dao has no known beginning, and thus occupies the most exalted station. Reflecting humbly upon the sacred succession of the grand design, I have been favored with an auspicious mandate. The jade tally of Mount Qiao was already bestowed through the river’s reeds, and the burial of silk in the propitious earth was once more witnessed in the cauldron of Fen. By the gracious protection of the Most High, the rites and ceremonies have been made resplendent. Gazing upon the famed mountains of recorded titles, and beholding the sacred halls where spirits gather, I have conducted solemn purifications and offered pure libations to repay the vast blessings. May my sincere devotion penetrate the divine, and may extraordinary omens draw near in familiarity.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, I can find no respite.

Respectfully submitted.

**To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Venerable Great Emperor**
I prostrate myself before the Boundless Void of the Unoriginated, whose true footsteps cannot be fathomed. All beings endowed with form are encompassed by Your great mercy. The myriad transformations accord You the highest reverence, and the hundred kings receive their mandate from You. Though this humble servant is of meager virtue, I have inherited the extended succession of the celestial reckoning. Having trodden the true Dao-wind, I have distantly relied upon the sacred shelter. In the watchful stillness of the pure night, Your divine immortals suddenly descended; in the purple hall, where the spirit was concentrated, I reverently received Your secret instructions. How dare I not devoutly follow Your radiant favor and redouble my sincerity? I shall further refine the rites of purity and reverence to express my profound gratitude.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, I can find no respite.

Respectfully submitted.

---

**To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Venerable Great Emperor**
I prostrate myself before the One whose foundation for governing the state is to honor Heaven as supreme, and whose root for transforming the people is to exalt the Dao above all. Never forgetting the reverent devotion due, I have thus been moved to this response. Auspicious omens and prophetic dreams have manifested in accord with the appointed time. As the pure night unfolded, Your purple presence descended and lingered long. I personally proclaimed Your sacred instructions, revealing the luminous signs. To receive such vast blessings fills me with shame for my inadequate virtue. I shall diligently attend to all governance to repay Your boundless grace.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, I can find no respite.

Respectfully submitted.

**Six Petitions for Blessings to Protect the People**

**To Heaven**
I prostrate myself before the One who holds this singular qi, governing the myriad spirits. You truly nurture and shelter all living beings, and Your gaze surveys the entire realm. Reflecting humbly upon the grand foundation I have inherited and the radiant favor I have received, though I have roughly achieved peace and order, I have not forgotten the need for vigilance and caution. Yet I still fear that the myriad creatures may not attain tranquility. It is fitting to rely upon the divine power of aid from below to harmonize the governance of universal peace. Thus, I devoutly conduct pure libations to express my sincere devotion. I humbly pray that auspicious blessings descend from the Ninefold Clarity, bestowing grace upon the Six Directions, and that the stars follow their courses without deviation. May the harvests of grain be abundant, and the lands of Heng, Zhang, Tai, and Hua flourish; may the borders remain undisturbed, and the regions of Guanghan and Panyu be secure. May the counties and roads ever prosper, and all under the common script and wheels be free from pestilence and disease. Should I receive the favor of the Most High, my reverent awe shall only deepen.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, I can find no respite.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Three Clarities,

We humbly acknowledge that the teachings of the Primordial Unity and the boundless deities govern the hundred spirits and bring forth the myriad existences. Reflecting upon the solemn charge we have received to succeed and govern the central realm, we aspire to nurture the common folk yet remain in awe of the vast heavens. Fearing our virtue may prove insufficient to achieve great peace, we seek to offer resplendent blessings and thus reverently implore pure bestowals. Therefore, we devoutly conduct pure libations to express our sincere devotion. We pray that the mysterious responses shine forth, that the black-haired people enjoy prosperity and longevity, that the Three Luminaries follow their courses, and that the hundred grains ripen in due time. May the lands of Jiao River and Liao Sea forever resonate with the voice of governance; may the domains of the Five Ridges and Two Rivers ever attain tranquility. May we harmonize with benevolent pacification, truly relying on divine regard. We dare to redouble our reverent awe and earnestly seek the grace of protection.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, we can find no respite. Respectfully submitted.

To the August Ancestor, Heavenly Venerable, and Great Emperor,

We humbly acknowledge that Your radiant and majestic power has manifested in auspicious decrees. Our hearts are wholly devoted, and pure bestowals have duly arrived. To shelter the multitudes below, we rely entirely upon Your grand responses. We pray that the people be free from pestilence, that the year ensure a harmonious harvest, that timely rains fall as needed, and that the Five Stars follow their proper paths. May the seven weapons be stilled throughout the land, and may the single qi harmonize all living beings. With pure libations long prepared, we beseech Your descending gaze; may great felicity fully prevail, truly depending upon the accumulation of blessings.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, we can find no respite. Respectfully submitted.

---

Moreover,

We humbly acknowledge that in aiding the multitudes, we truly rely upon the divine Way. May the mysterious gaze above turn toward us, and may we redouble our devotion. Reflecting upon our succession in governing the central realm, we inwardly lament our deficient governance. Last autumn’s harvests fell short of the year’s potential; this spring’s planting fills us with greater dread of heavenly afflictions. Thus, we pour forth our sincere devotion below and reverently seek abundant fortune above. We pray that wind and rain come in due season, that granaries may be filled with hope. Awaiting the manifestation of Your luminous responses, our trepidation only deepens.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, we can find no respite. Respectfully submitted.

---

To the August Ancestor, Heavenly Venerable, and Great Emperor,

We humbly acknowledge that the sufferings of living beings, though silently ordained, have their appointed time; the blessings bestowed upon all beings must be sought through great felicity. Gazing upon the frontier ramparts and the borderlands below, we note the spread of great floods and fear the displacement of the people. In seeking resplendent blessings, we dare to offer our sincere devotion. May Your majestic power perceive our reverence and abundantly bestow felicity and fortune. May the people’s calamities cease, relying upon the manifest aid of Heaven.

Overwhelmed by the burden of gratitude, we can find no respite. Respectfully submitted.

With utmost sincerity and trembling devotion, we respectfully submit this prayer.

To the Jade Emperor,

Your servant, governing the central realm, is shamed by his unworthy virtue. Though Your luminous protection has been graciously bestowed, our governance has failed to strike the mean. Recently, within the princely residence, embers were left unattended, and the flames soon spread to the palace precincts. Though long since extinguished, the fire caused considerable damage. The fault lies with human error; how dare we not acknowledge our guilt? Yet we reflect in awe, striving to improve. May we humble ourselves and earnestly pray for Your gracious regard. With utmost sincerity and trembling devotion, we respectfully submit this prayer.

To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Honored Great Emperor,

Your servant, having received Your protection, has accumulated reverent awe. Yet reflecting on the recent alarm, we find no peace.

The heart that acknowledges fault trembles without respite; the earnest plea for manifest gratitude humbly beseeches Your gracious regard. With utmost sincerity and trembling devotion, we respectfully submit this prayer.

To the Northern Culmen,

Your servant, ever mindful of his unworthy virtue, reverently inherits the great legacy. Though we strive earnestly from dawn, our governance is replete with shortcomings.

With utmost sincerity and trembling devotion, we respectfully submit this prayer.

To the Hall of the Two Stars,

Reflecting on the benevolence of Heaven’s regard, we have received its protection; yet the virtue of our rule is shamed by our humble station.

How dare we forget to acknowledge our fault and offer repentance to the luminous numen? With utmost sincerity and trembling devotion, we respectfully submit this prayer.

To the Various Minor Halls,

Privately reflecting on the mandate we have received, we have abundantly attained radiant favor. Yet in our humble station, we reflect and fail to repay the great blessings.

Through negligence in guarding the princely residence, disaster spread in raging flames. The inner sanctum was shaken, the central halls consumed by fire. Reflecting on the unmanifested vastness of your virtue, we accumulate this crimson heart in self-reproach. With daring humility, we offer our gratitude, earnestly hoping for your gracious regard.

To the Three Clarities of the Supreme Clarity Palace,

This humble servant’s virtue is too meager to evoke resonance. Yet the boundless benevolence of the celestial vault has deigned to turn its compassionate gaze.

A moment’s lapse in vigilance over the princely residence allowed the raging flames to suddenly spread in alarming conflagration. Mindful of our inadequacy, how dare we neglect self-examination? With reverent sincerity, we strive to express our luminous gratitude.

To the Jade Emperor,

This humble servant, inheriting this great mandate, though never forgetting diligence and caution, momentarily faltered in vigilance. Within the princely residence, a lingering ember suddenly flared. Within the central halls, the fire swiftly spread. Recognizing our failure in careful watchfulness, we deeply reproach ourselves. With reverent humility, we offer our gratitude, trusting in your gracious regard of our utmost sincerity.

To the Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Honored Great Emperor,

This humble servant, continuing the blessed legacy, trembles in awe of the numinous mandate. Though filled with trepidation, we have failed to repay your watchful gaze. Raging flames spread disaster, arising unexpectedly in the royal residence; the encircling corridors could not be saved, and the fire swiftly reached the central gate. Inwardly reflecting on our inadequacy, we find no peace. We humbly beseech the vast source to accept our luminous gratitude, daring to extend our sincere devotion in full.
