**Memorial for Prolonging Life and Dissolving Calamities**
*Used in the Seven Luminaries Retreat*

Your humble servant [Name], in profound reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this memorial:

Though unworthy, I have been entrusted with the sacred rank, vowing to propagate the mysterious Daoist teachings. With earnest devotion, I now humbly submit this petition.

In accordance with the intent of this retreat, I reflect upon the vast expanse of the celestial vault, where the constellations trace their paths, governing the omens of the earth below and scrutinizing the fortunes and misfortunes of mortal lives. Moreover, destiny is apportioned like branches from a trunk, and fate is arrayed with blessings and punishments. The Six Jia and Three Origins cycle through the years and months, while the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities inspect the days and hours. Without the aid of various destinies to sustain the declining, how could disasters be dispelled and lifespans extended?

I respectfully present this memorial, to be heard by the Three Heavens. May the imperial grace shine boundlessly, and the celestial favor spread widely. May a mighty decree be issued, proclaiming to the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, to the jade armillary and the celestial balance, to the Three Heavenly Bureaus, the Twelve Branches of the Sky, the Sixty Jia-Zi, and the governing officials and lords: On behalf of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], may the calamities of their natal destiny be removed, and the afflictions of the current year’s transgressions be dissolved.

May the Two Cycles and Three Limits all be graced by auspicious stars, and the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces avoid encountering malevolent luminaries. May misfortunes be averted, and propitious omens continue unbroken.

I respectfully invoke:
- **The Southern Supreme Lord**, **The Lord of Longevity**, **The Cinnabar Register Lord**, **The Crimson Palace Lord**, **The Disaster-Dispelling Lord**, and **The Impurity-Dissolving Lord**, each attended by 120 officials and generals, to eradicate malevolent stars and deliver from calamities to extend life.
- **The True Unity Lord of Great Harmony**, **The Lord of Qi Circulation**, and **The Lord of Destiny-Fixing**, each with five attendants and 120 officials and generals, to harmonize the flow of the year and exorcise malevolent luminaries.
- **The Calamity-Dissolving and Punishment-Releasing Lord**, **The Lifespan-Extending and Destiny-Augmenting Lord**, **The Life-Petitioning and Life-Nurturing Lord**, **The Punishment-Restraining and Death-Repelling Lord**, **The Punishment-Cutting and Death-Severing Lord**, and **The Punishment-Enforcing and Death-Collecting Lord**, each with five attendants and 120 officials and generals, to augment destiny and prolong life, restraining punishments and death.
- **The Lord of Myriad Blessings**, **The Southern Culmen Lord**, **The Lord of Destiny**, **The Lord of Venus the Bright Star**, **The Jade Calendar Lord of Name-Fixing**, and **The Lords of the Treasury of Wealth and Treasury of Fortune**, each with five attendants and 120 officials and generals, to inscribe living names and erase the records of death.
- **The Lord of Soul-Restraining and Spirit-Controlling**, **The Lord of Jade Circuits**, and 1,200 **Plain-Clad Maidens of the Jade Calendar**, to restrain the hun-soul, guard the po-soul, record the spirits, and protect the qi.
- **The Heavenly Bureau Lord of Disaster-Dissolving and Misfortune-Removing**, **The Lords of the Five Directions’ Generative Qi**, **The Life-Extending Lord**, and the **Six Jia Generals with their attendant officials and soldiers**, to deliver from calamities, dispel disasters, expel evil, and preserve life.

May the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], enjoy harmony in their fate and limits, peace in body and destiny. In all movements and stillness, in all goings and comings, may the stars of fortune and swiftness attend them. In the divisions of the sky, may there be no clashes of disaster and punishment.

If Jupiter brings calamity, Venus shall restrain it.
If Saturn brings calamity, Jupiter shall restrain it.

If Venus brings calamity, Mars shall restrain it.
If Mercury brings calamity, Saturn shall restrain it.

Thus may the Five Phases be regulated, the Four Symbols harmonized, the foundation of fate be secured, the span of life be fortified, calamities be averted, decline be supported, disasters be dissolved, and destiny be preserved. May the blessings of life be widely extended, and the benevolence of nurturing all things be upheld.

As herein petitioned, may the mysterious favor be manifest. With reverence for the great Dao, we humbly seek mercy.

Your servant, in foolishness, respectfully submits this memorial through the Direct Envoys of the Two Bureaus, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Decree Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Just Wind Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Memorial Clerks, the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks, the Phoenix Cavalry Memorial Officers, the Cloud-Dragon Cavalry Petition Officers, the Wind-Swift Cavalry Escort Officers, the Divine Dragon Cavalry Memorial Officers, and the Flying Dragon and Flying Tiger Cavalry—each pair dispatched to present the memorial.

Your servant, on behalf of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. May the celestial grace respond in kind. Your servant, with awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully petitions for audience.

**Memorial for Earth-Thanking and House-Pacifying (Used in House-Pacifying Retreats)**

Your servant pledges his heart to the teachings and strives to deliver others. Though he measures his own inadequacy, he has long been nurtured by grace and dares to pour forth his meager devotion, aspiring to repay the boundless favor of the mountains and seas.

Your servant, in accordance with the retreat’s intent, reflects that the sponsor, [Name], in his worldly endeavors, has labored diligently to establish a household. In the construction of dwellings, the laying of foundations has been unsettled, and the shifting of earth and walls may have violated taboos. Moreover, the alignment of stars and the cycles of baleful spirits, the selection of days and hours, or inadvertent transgressions in direction and position may have invited misfortune. Seeking tranquility from the Earth Controller and refuge at the Imperial Threshold, he hopes for blessings and the preemptive dissolution of peril.

Respectfully submitting this memorial to the Three Heavens, may the August Ultimate bestow its auspicious influence, and the Azure Vault oversee and witness. May the qi of the Jade Purity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure descend and infuse the sponsor’s newly constructed dwelling, illuminating its interior and exterior, near and far, guiding myriad fortunes and repelling a thousand malevolent forces. May the true spirits be stationed to guard each corner, and any offended baleful spirits be turned toward benevolence. May generations and years be blessed with mysterious favor.

Your servant respectfully invokes:
- The Earth-Thanking Lords,
- The Earth-Restraining Lords,
- The Earth-Dissolving Lords,
- The Earth-Pacifying Lords,
- The Earth-Stabilizing Lords,
- The House-Pacifying Lords,
- The Five Directions’ Protective Lords,
- The Merit-Dissolving and Loss-Breaking Lords—each five in number,
- Their attendant officials and generals, one hundred twenty each,

to dissolve and absolve all violations of taboos incurred in the construction of the dwelling.

The Great Generals of the Grand Year and Grand Yin, the one hundred twenty official talismans, the baleful spirits of Toxic Fire, Hanging Guests, Funeral Gates, and all upper and lower malevolent forces—may they all be pacified and released. For any local deities displaced by excavation, may they be duly notified and restored to their original positions.

The Yang Direction Lords, the Upper-Pacifying Lords, the Right Capital Attendants, the Stone-Pacifying and Earth-Pacifying Lords—each one, with their attendant officials and generals, one hundred twenty each, and their inspecting officers and soldiers—are to gather and restrain the ghosts of the Earth Lords, preventing them from encroaching upon the village.

The Divine Lords of the Great Officers guarding the house, the Great Spirits guarding the house, and the Three Generals with their three hundred thousand soldiers are to expel and suppress the old qi of the Five Directions’ earth, intercept and sever malevolent spirits, and prevent them from encroaching.

The Generals of the Five Sacred Peaks, the Six Jia Divine Generals, the Five Directions’ House-Pacifying Great Generals, the House-Protecting Great Generals, the House-Guarding Great Generals, and the House-Securing Great Generals—eleven each—are to secure and pacify the dwelling, expel malevolent spirits, and dissolve the Nine Transverse Calamities, the Three Disasters, and the thousand misfortunes and myriad calamities.

May no harm come to the residents. Thus may the sponsor, [Name], from this day forward, enjoy peace in all affairs, a radiant dwelling, a serene household, and freedom from theft, loss, and misfortune. May water, fire, and official disasters not afflict his vicinity; may ghostly malevolence and illness be eradicated; may pestilence not arise; may his livelihood prosper; may his studies and arts flourish; may wealth and honor know no bounds; and may his family and dependents thrive in safety. Let this be the sign of efficacy.

**Memorial for Dispelling Pestilence and Protecting from Illness**

Your servant, unworthily appointed and presumptuously ranked among the honored, feels deep shame for his shallowness and has yet to attain the profound. Though he has repeatedly petitioned the celestial court and searched his own heart to recognize his faults, he humbly hopes for the boundless compassion of the august grace to bestow its nurturing mercy.

Your servant, in accordance with the retreat’s intent, reflects that the sponsor, [Name], though dwelling in the mundane world, must strive for his livelihood. Amid the Five Desires and Seven Emotions, how could he be free from obscuring entanglements? With the hundred wrongs and myriad transgressions, how could he avoid accumulating faults? Thus, he is assailed by cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, and his fate and destiny are beset by hardship. Suddenly afflicted by pestilential qi, he finds himself in peril. Without the imperial grace’s compassion, how could his remaining years be blessed?

Respectfully submitting this memorial to the Three Heavens, may the great virtue, in its boundless mercy, bestow the qi of the Jade Purity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure to infuse the sponsor’s body and household. May the upright qi shine brightly, malevolent influences be driven far away, disasters be dissolved, calamities be averted, life be preserved, and longevity be extended.

Your servant respectfully invokes:
- The Lords of the Nine Yi of the Northern Gate,
- The Lords of the Northern Black Heavenly Mechanism,
- The Qi-Directing and Calamity-Dissolving Lords,
- The Earth Bureau Qi-Supervising Lords—each five in number,
- Their attendant officials and generals, one hundred twenty each,

**Petition for Gathering Malevolence, Severing Anomalies, Dissolving Calamities, and Preserving Life**

Your servant, humble and unworthy, dull-witted and benighted, has long been bathed in vast grace, presumptuously overseeing the Mysterious Teachings. Vowing to ferry others with fervor, I strive to assist in the propagation of transformation. For all who take refuge, how dare I forget to make supplication?

Your servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, humbly reflects: the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, has encountered adversity in fate, his person beset by malevolent anomalies, leading to disquiet in sleep and sustenance, and derangement in spirit and mind. This has given rise to illness, where medicines and remedies prove ineffectual. Fearing entanglement in karmic grievances, which linger unresolved, as time passes, the strange symptoms grow more severe. Without petitioning the Void and Mysterious, how could grace flow to the encompassing hub?

Respectfully, I present a petition to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that boundless compassion will be generously bestowed, and special favor granted. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance be poured into the person and household of the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, illuminating within and without, brightening the gates and halls. Where the numinous light shines, malevolent spirits shall depart afar; illness shall be pacified and healed, and longevity prolonged.

Your servant respectfully invokes the Heavenly Numinous Officials of Severing Malevolence, the Merit Officers, the Spirit-Guarding Body Officials, the Malevolence-Severing Envoys, the Body-Protecting Generals, the Malevolence-Inspecting Direct Talismans, the Malevolence-Severing Piercing Treacherous Officials, and the Spirit-Seizing Envoys, who are to drive away and expel spectral beings and capture inauspicious malevolence.

The Yang Brightness Lord—one, with one hundred twenty officials and generals—together with the local true officials, various departments’ officials and soldiers, the altars of the soil and grain, the spirits of mountains and forests, and the elders of the graves, shall unite in strength with the household-guarding deities of the home, pursuing and apprehending without allowing concealment or omission, escorting them to the Heavenly Prison, and eradicating them according to the law.

Furthermore, I invoke the Left and Right Yin-Yang Grand Physician Officials to heal the source of illness; the Supreme Harmony True One Life-Preserving Lord to dissolve and dispel baleful influences. May the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, attain peace and harmony in body, the annihilation of malevolent spirits, the healing of illness, and the harmonization of medicines and diet. May his family and dependents enjoy well-being, his gates and halls be pure and solemn, his daily life proceed as he wishes, his plans and actions succeed, and may he forever preserve advantage and integrity, as a token of efficacy.

**Petition for Preserving Health and Dissolving Calamities, for Use in Blessing Fasts**

Your servant, ignorant in learning and coarse in nature, has fortunately received the blessings of former lives, presumptuously ascending the true ranks. Vowing to exert myself in salvation’s toil, I strive to repay the virtue of life’s creation.

Your servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, humbly considers: the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, suffers from calamitous decline in fate, his form and spirit withered and emaciated. The three karmas and ten evils have long burdened his conduct and reclusion; the six luminaries and five planets have temporarily aligned in adverse positions. Suddenly afflicted by illness, his sleep and sustenance are disturbed; medicines and remedies prove ineffectual, and time passes ever longer. Startled day and night, he finds no avenue for appeal. Without relying on divine shelter, how could he attain recovery?

Respectfully, I present a petition to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that boundless compassion will generously bestow beneficent grace. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance be poured into the person and household of the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, dissolving calamitous qi and illuminating with numinous light, so that his present illness may soon be pacified.

Your servant respectfully invokes the Yang Order Lord—one, with one hundred twenty Life-Commanding Officials—to swiftly heal severe, unhealed illnesses.

The Momentary Lord and Red Heaven Qi-Consuming Lord—each one, with one hundred twenty officials and generals—are to heal long-standing, debilitating illnesses.

One thousand two hundred Jade Maidens are to administer treatments according to prescriptions.

Twelve Grand Medical Officials of the Central Palace are to select formulas and compound medicines.

Twelve Heavenly Physicians, twelve Official Physicians, and twelve Grand Physicians of the Five Offices—each group of twelve—are to enter the viscera, bowels, meridians, and joints, circulating spirit and storing qi.

Twelve Heavenly Clerks of the Celestial Bureau and twelve Grand Medical Officials of the Upper Peace, along with fifteen Merit-Recording Clerks for Healing, are to ascend to the Phoenix Supreme Clarity Palace and retrieve the five-colored divine medicines.

The Harmonizing Official Lord, the Wooden Office for Healing Illnesses, the Metal Office for Holding Medicines, the Water Office for Holding Needles, the Fire-and-Water Office, and the Earth Office for Moxibustion—each one, in harmonious virtue—are to render extraordinary merit.

The East Azure Qi-Generating Lord, the South Vermilion Qi-Generating Lord, the West White Qi-Generating Lord, the North Black Qi-Generating Lord, and the Central Yellow Qi-Generating Lord—each, leading their officers and soldiers—are to expel evil and gather illness.

May the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, thus enjoy a robust qi-body, with calamities and declines dissolved, pernicious spirits kept far away, litigations and misfortunes pacified, illnesses and afflictions eradicated, life and body secured, medicines efficacious, movements and rests free from demonic interference, and destiny flourishing and propitious—all as tokens of efficacy.

**Transmission of the Dharma, Conferral of the Dao, Prayer for Grace, and Atonement for Transgressions**

Your servant, undeserving of imperial favor and overstepping to inherit the lineage of masters, aspires to guide later disciples and humbly continue the work of former worthies. Presumptuously presenting this private petition, I look up in gratitude for the profound grace of nurturance.

Your servant, in accordance with the fast’s intent, reflects that the Jade Statutes of the Female Azure and the selection of candidates are most arduous, while the Golden Regulations of the Supreme Ultimate and the responsibilities of sponsorship are especially weighty. If transmission and conferral deviate from practice, both master and disciple will transgress the statutes.

Now the disciple, so-and-so, purifies himself to seek the true, wishing to partake in the supreme Dharma. Yet upon quiet reflection, hindrances and encumbrances are manifold: perhaps his spirit-qi is difficult to preserve for cultivation of longevity, or his bone-phase does not accord with Dao-potency; perhaps the lawsuits of his nine ancestors and seven generations remain unresolved, or the grudges of four debts and three lives persist; perhaps karmic retributions from past and present lives still linger, or past errors and present misdeeds remain unforgiven. Without the gift of refinement, how can his lofty aspirations be fulfilled?

Respectfully presenting a memorial, I submit it to the Three Heavens, hoping for the gracious bestowal of mysterious favor and the compassionate regard of this red petition. May the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of Numinous Treasure be poured into the five palaces and six mansions of the disciple, so-and-so, so that his upright qi may shine brilliantly, his Dao-heart be awakened, numinous light envelop him, and delusory encumbrances dissolve.

Further, I beseech the salvation of his life, proclaiming to the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, and all relevant mystical bureaus, to specifically eradicate and dissolve his karmic retributions and litigations, absolve his transgressions, inscribe his name in the Mysterious Register, and fix his destiny in the Azure Tablet.

Your servant respectfully invokes the Supreme Nine Heavenly Thearchs, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Palace of the Sun and the Mansion of the Moon, the Five Planets and Four Luminaries, the Southern Asterism and Northern Culmen, the Star Lords of the Constellations, the Three Ministries and Five Masters, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Heavenly Clerks in charge, the True Spirits of the Four Caverns, the Grotto-Heavens of Blessed Lands, the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses, the Earth-and-Water Administrators, and the deities of the Three Realms—all to assemble at the Mysterious Altar and witness the transmission and conferral.

I further invoke the Six Divisions of Numinous Treasure, the Immortal Officials of the Three Realms, the Mysterious Bureaus of all directions, the Illustrious Immortal Bureaus, the Scripture-Attending Guardians of the Mysterious Altar, the Protectors of the Dao and Descenders of the True, the Summoned and Affiliated Immortal Clerks, the Nine Heavens’ Life-Commanding Mansion, the Azure Mystery and Yellow Register Courts, the Jade Clarity Divine Empyrean Jade Mansion, the Supreme Clarity Youthful Primordial Mansion, the Mysterious Numinous Pivot Mansion, the Northern Culmen Mysterious Model Mansion, the Numinous Treasure As-You-Wish Myriad Bureaus, the Nine Heavens’ Universal Salvation Court, and all relevant generals, divine clerks, jade lads, and jade maidens for the transmission.

Let the generals and officials swiftly divide their luminous forms, follow the incense and fire, wait upon the proceedings, and assist in the proclamation and execution.

May the disciple, so-and-so, swear oaths before the myriad spirits, pledge alliances with the host of sages, diligently cultivate and advance, study the Dao and seek the true, maintain mindfulness and practice, aid the living and deliver the departed, assume immortal office, align his heart with the Mysterious Origin, attain luminous wisdom, benefit with compassion, extinguish demonic trials, daily accumulate numinous blessings, enhance his reputation, draw near and distant followers, perfect his merits and complete his Dao, ascend bodily as an immortal, eternally propagate the true wind, glorify his lineage, vow to endure through the vast kalpas, and return to revere the Mysterious Origin.

If my petition is granted, may the sagely work be manifestly revealed.

**Atonement for Transgressions and Prayer for Rain: Memorial for the Thunder-and-Lightning Fast**

Your servant, foolish and unworthy, of no merit and full of errors, has long relied on the grace of nurturance and striven to refine his resolve. Charged with transmitting the teachings and promulgating virtue to aid others, I dutifully report all who seek refuge.

Your servant, in accordance with the fast’s intent, reflects that spring plowing and autumn harvest are the constants of agriculture, while prolonged drought and scorching yang are aberrations of qi-movement. If timely rain does not spread for sowing, how can fine grain be hoped for in abundant harvest? Moreover, the fields are parched as if burned, and the common folk are filled with sorrow and sighs—how can the year be brought to completion? Famine is imminent. Truly, the accumulated transgressions of the myriad masses are vast, and the divine reproach of the earth-administering deities is not slight. The power of the Thearch cannot attend to the people’s lamentations.

A memorial is hereby reverently submitted to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the Dao’s all-accomplishing virtue and the compassionate response of boundless mercy. May a special edict be issued, commanding all true administrations across the ten directions and three realms to absolve the hidden and manifest transgressions of the common people and to relieve the hardships of a year imperiled by famine. Let sweet rains swiftly descend to nourish the young shoots. Further, may the authorities governing thunder and lightning, the officers presiding over wind and rain, the dragon deities of deep ravines and sacred springs, the city gods and mountain spirits, the altars of soil and grain, and all subordinate deities under their jurisdiction each embody merciful benevolence. Let the Lords of Wind and Rain be summoned, the Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother be directed, that timely rains may universally moisten the parched earth and revive the withered crops.

Your servant reverently petitions the Heavenly Elder of Upright Qi, the Perfected of the River’s Edge, the Nine Seas’ Nine Rivers’ Northern Mystery Lords—one each—and their retinue of one hundred twenty officials, who govern the qi of water sources and summon clouds to bring rain. From the sea, one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens; from the rivers, thirty-six Lords of the River, including Master Lü’s Heir, who command the activation of water veins and the descent of wind and rain. The Lords of the Four Continents and Nine Valleys, the Luminous Lord of the Han Terrace, the Nine Provinces’ Mysterious Darkness Lords, the Nine Rivers’ Northern Mystery Lords, and the Nine Lords of the Feudatories—one each—with their retinues of one hundred twenty officials each, and one thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of the lakes, who summon and dispatch the River Earl’s envoys, the Azure Water Thearch, the Nine Rivers’ Water Thearchs, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the water-department spirits and river-pacifying officers, to act in concert and bring rain. May they descend in timely fashion upon the realm’s borders, driving thunder and dispatching lightning, stirring winds and spreading clouds. First, let gentle rains fall upon the rivers; next, let torrents pour across the fields and wilds. May sweet rains promptly answer the season’s call, reviving withered grain and turning barren plains to green. May the shoots flower and bear fruit, the year yield abundance, and calamities be averted. Let joy resound across the plains, and gladness echo among the aged. May the petitioner’s lifelong devotion be fulfilled, and the grace of foundational blessings be generously bestowed. Further, may all grains ripen, the nine regions prosper, locusts vanish without trace, and malevolent spirits retreat into hiding. Let the three agricultural seasons bring full bellies and warm clothing, and may all people, in serving their elders and nurturing their young, live a hundred years in radiant splendor. Should this plea be granted, the imperial favor shall shine forth in full.

A second memorial is reverently submitted to the Three Heavens, beseeching continued grace. Your servant, a lowly speck of dust, unworthy and base, has presumptuously received the true teachings yet possesses no merit worthy of record, only countless faults deserving of censure. Yet, through the boundless grace of nurturing protection, I dare to prostrate nine times in utmost sincerity and offer these humble words, trusting they may reach the celestial hearing.

Your servant, in accordance with the fast’s intent, reflects that the bond between father and child is the foundation of human relations, and the proper distinction between husband and wife is the constant of heavenly affinity. If one’s fate is afflicted by solitary stars or adverse conjunctions—whether by encountering the Widow Star, mutual imprisonment, or clashes with penal stars—so that the line of descent remains unfulfilled and the ancestral lineage finds no heir, then as twilight approaches and the years hasten toward decline, without petitioning the Dark Vault of Heaven, how can one hope to receive the grace of the Yellow Prime?

A memorial is hereby reverently submitted to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the great virtue of cherishing life and the perfect benevolence that excludes none. May a special edict be issued, commanding the Dark Bureau to absolve all conflicts and clashes in the petitioner’s present and past lives. Further, may the Jade Purity’s Daoist Blackness and the Numinous Treasure’s Wondrous Radiance be bestowed, pouring into the body and mind of the petitioner’s wife, Mistress So-and-so, that she may rise and move in peace, her womb quicken with conception, illness be averted, and her vital and protective qi flourish beyond the ordinary. May the ten months pass in fullness, and a male heir be born, fulfilling the petitioner’s deepest wish and bringing manifold blessings.

Your servant reverently petitions the Lords of Life and Record, the Southern Dipper’s Lord of Birth and Transformation, the Eastern Dipper’s Lord of Stellar Qi Communication, the Western Dipper’s Lord of Soul Formation and Fetal Conception, the Northern Dipper’s Lord of Soul Communication and Blood-Bone Solidification, and the Central Dipper’s Lord of Soul Transformation and Vocal Articulation—each charged with perfecting the womb and gathering the hun and po souls. The Lady of Birth, the Heavenly Maidens of Birth, the Heavenly Maidens of Meridian and Bone Circulation, and the Heavenly Maidens of Stellar Fetal Transformation—five each—with their retinues of twelve officials each, who harmonize yin and yang and shape the fetus. Five Ladies of Fetal Transformation, who ascend to the palaces of the Five Directions and Five Dippers, beseeching the true qi of the five directions to nurture the petitioner’s wife, Mistress So-and-so, regulating her vital and protective qi to solidify the pregnancy. The Lords of the Five Phases, the White Mystery Lord of Primordial Clarity, and the Literary Chronicle Lord—one each—with their retinues of one hundred twenty officials each, who descend qi to form the fetus, expel evil and protect the upright, resolve marital clashes, and ensure the birth of a male child. The Lords of Supreme Harmony, the Lords of Yin-Yang Generative Qi, and the Lords of the Three Primes’ Cinnabar Fields—five each—with their retinues of one hundred twenty officials each, who circulate blood and qi, envelop the white with the yellow, and draw abundant yang qi to firmly bind the male fetus. The Yang Spirit Envoys, the Male Spirit and Jade Maidens—two each—and the Lords of the First Celestial Stem, who assist in solidifying the true fetus and gathering yang qi, transforming a female fetus into a male if conception has already occurred. May the petitioner’s wife, Mistress So-and-so, conceive and carry the child without harm, bearing a male of pure yang, free from dietary restrictions. May the months of pregnancy be fulfilled, and a male child be born without delay at an auspicious day and hour. May mother and child emerge whole, serving as a sign of efficacy.

A third memorial is reverently submitted, beseeching official emolument. Your servant, worthless and filthy, has presumptuously received the grace of rain and dew, yet fears the accumulation of thunderous reproach. I humbly implore the vast creation to deign to regard me with compassion.

Your servant, charged with transmitting the teachings, finds it difficult to refuse the faithful yet follows the true statutes in sequential practice. I reflect that the promotion of the worthy and the elevation of the talented depend first on fate’s conjunctions and second on personal cultivation. If the accumulated merits of ancestors remain unpresented, and past and present transgressions are particularly grave, then even with diligent practice, official rank will prove elusive. Without the Thearch’s sustaining grace, how can the people’s hopes be fulfilled?

A solemn memorial is hereby reverently presented, ascending to the Three Heavens. May the Great Compassion deign to bestow its gracious favor, issuing a special imperial decree to be transmitted throughout the Three Realms and all subordinate offices of the Mysterious Bureaus. For [the petitioner’s name], may it dispel stellar entanglements, harmonize the flow of qi, absolve accumulated hindrances, record meritorious deeds, and augment official rank, thereby glorifying the ancestral lineage.

Your servant humbly petitions the Master Lord, one person, and the divine generals, one hundred twenty in number, along with the Clear Brightness Lord of the Eastern Well and his attending officers, to descend as one. With the warming, moistening, clear, harmonious, numinous, and beneficent black [essence], may they suffuse [the petitioner’s] five viscera, four limbs, body, and joints, settling the spirit, safeguarding the true qi, expelling the Three Corpses, eradicating the Nine Worms, turning from death toward life, averting misfortune and summoning blessings, opening the mind and elevating talents.

The Lord of the Five Classics and Nine Qi, one person, with his one hundred twenty generals, presides over perfect wisdom and luminous clarity, distinct from the multitude. The Heavenly Kings and Jade Maidens, one thousand two hundred in number, clad in azure robes, lead the myriad officials, bestowing seals and cords to govern all movements and enable communion with the divine.

The Jade Calendar Maidens of the White Register, one thousand two hundred in number, clad in crimson robes, record names in the Jade Calendar and inscribe longevity in the Vermilion Register.

Should [the petitioner], at the outset of an official career, aspire to oversee granaries, manage treasuries, supervise markets, command troops, or administer schools, then let the deities of yin and yang preside over these domains. May the responsive and upright local spirits be entreated to secretly bestow their favor, ensuring that rank and emolument align with his aspirations and that virtue and conduct attain perfection.

After the great selection, should he seek advancement in rank and promotion in office, then let the stellar bodies above govern his fate. May the Purple Tenuity and Supreme Tenuity enclosures, the ducal ministers and generals, the Minister of Justice, the Chief Ministers, the Three Terraces of Wenchang, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Eastern Wall and Straddler constellations, the Feathered Forest and Rampart Walls, and the Generals of the Strategic Gates—all who preside over human offices—be entreated. Let these stars collectively manifest their portents, radiating their essence and unfurling their luminous splendor, enabling him to soar directly into the ministries, departments, and frontier commands. May he attain the glory of ninefold advancement, the wealth of tenfold bounty, serve the state with loyalty, transmit purity to his descendants, and enjoy the fullness of emolument and longevity as a sign of efficacy.

**Memorial for Prolonging Life and Dispelling Calamity, Invoking Longevity**

Your servant, born under auspicious foundations and flourishing fortune, has worn the Chart of the Phoenix to transmit the teachings and received the Script of the Phoenix to study the true. Profoundly reliant on celestial shelter, how may I repay such grace? I dare to pour forth my humble thoughts before the thousand-weight hearing of the august, humbly beseeching the exalted to deign to observe and examine.

Your servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, reflects that while human nature desires longevity, the great virtue cherishes life. If one’s fate encounters the tread of ominous stars, or one’s person faces adversity, how can calamitous illness be avoided, and how may years be preserved?

Now [the petitioner], inheriting the accumulated merits of his ancestors and bearing the responsibility of his household’s trust, seeks to prolong his years or extend his lifespan, to enjoy peace in due time and avoid toil amid obstacles, that his descendants may flourish and his prosperity and advantage abound. Without the compassionate regard of the Mysterious Creation, how may he attain the carefree old age of the Yellow Springs?

A solemn memorial is hereby reverently presented, ascending to the Three Heavens. May the vast workings of profound benevolence broadly bestow gracious favor, issuing a special imperial decree to be transmitted throughout the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and all subordinate offices of the Mysterious Bureaus. For [the petitioner], may it repel inauspicious stars, sever malevolent qi, instantly release grievances, and elevate both body and mind. Through the eight solar terms and four seasons, may no trifling misfortune be incurred, and may he ever dwell in felicity, forever abiding in blessed longevity, completing a full century in peace and health.

Your servant humbly petitions the Heavenly Bureaus: the Lord Who Dispels Calamity and Removes Misfortune, the Lord Who Augments Longevity, the Lords of the Five Directions’ Generative Qi, and the Generals of the Six Jia, who preside over the elimination of disasters and the deliverance from calamity, the augmentation of life and the expulsion of evil.

The Lord of Myriad Blessings, the Lord Who Circulates Qi, the Lord Who Dispels Calamity, the Southern Superior Lord, the Lord of Life Mandate, the Lord of Life Records, the Bright Star Lord of Venus, the Lords Who Restrain Hun and Po Souls, the Lord of the Treasury of Wealth, the Lord of the Treasury of Emolument, and the Lord Who Fixes Names in the Jade Calendar, each five in number, with one hundred twenty generals each, who preside over the removal of names from the Register of Death and the inscription of names in the Register of Life.

The Lords Who Gather Grievances, Sever Omens, and Break Calamities, each one person, with one hundred twenty generals each, who preside over the resolution of calamities and the redemption of lifespan.

The Lord of Longevity in the Eastern Dipper, the Lord of Name-Recording in the Western Dipper, the Lord of Death-Removal in the Northern Dipper, the Lord of Life-Inscription in the Southern Dipper, and the Great Chief Lord of the Central Dipper, each one person, with one hundred twenty generals each, who preside over the deliverance from the five phases’ disasters and the augmentation of lifespan records.

The sixty cyclical signs, with their attending officials and soldiers, who preside over the resolution of the calamity of exhausted years and the elimination of disasters from declining fate and failing fortune.

The Lords of the Five Directions and Five Thearchs, with their attending officials and soldiers, each riding the true qi of their respective directions, wielding talismans and holding staffs, ascending to the palaces of the twenty-three celestial lodges and the Jade Calendar, to inspect the Registers of Life and augment the years inscribed.

All the departmental lords and officials, harmonizing and protecting, resolving the twenty-four calamities and augmenting longevity.

May it be thus granted that so-and-so’s fate flows smoothly, disasters and dangers are driven far away, blessings and emoluments flourish and gather, lifespan is prolonged, no difficulties nor calamities arise, and manifold auspiciousness and felicity abound. May descendants multiply in unbroken succession, and gates and households shine with radiance, as proof of efficacy.

**Memorial of Gratitude for Expiation and Prayer for Clear Skies**

Your servant, of humble and scattered endowment, by nature dull and foolish, yet ranked among the military and civil officials, forces himself to present memorials and respond in audience. Ever examining his heart to reflect on faults, he aspires to propagate the Dao and emulate Heaven, hoping thereby to attest to meritorious service and assist in the transformation and nurturance of all beings.

Your servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, humbly considers that the cultivation of crops and sowing of grain depend entirely upon Heaven’s timing, while autumn harvests and spring plowing rely solely on Earth’s bounty. It is wished that five winds and ten rains be bestowed, that the hundred grains may achieve triple abundance.

Moreover, the fields of the outskirts and countryside lie adjacent to ponds and embankments. When excessive rains arise, their surging becomes uncontrollable. Having endured ten days of continuous rain, the rice seedlings have largely been swept away by the currents and withered. The prospects for the year give cause for concern, and the people face impending famine. If the skies do not clear to stem the floods, how can there be a year of abundant harvest?

Relying entirely upon the sagely creation, I humbly beseech Your merciful regard. I reverently present this memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, trusting that the Emperor’s virtue, which cherishes life, and his compassion for the people’s plight, will prompt the issuance of a special edict. May it be proclaimed to the local altars and all the mysterious bureaus within the realm, dispersing the rain and gloom, swiftly bringing forth clear skies. Thus may the three agricultural labors proceed with diligence, the hundred grains ripen in abundance, the fields be free from the woes of inundation, and the common people be spared the suffering of hunger and famine. May they pass the year in ease, truly indebted to Heaven’s grace.

Your servant reverently petitions for the presence of the Lord of the True Qi of Heaven, one person, with one hundred twenty officials and generals, and seven hundred thousand soldiers; the Lord of the Northern Mystery of the Nine Seas, one person, with one hundred twenty officials and generals; and the Jade Maidens of the River, one thousand two hundred persons, who preside over the gathering of clouds and cessation of rain, the summoning of winds and the clearing of skies. May the officials and subordinates of the Water Springs, the functionaries of the Eight Seas and Nine Rivers, who govern the unblocking of obstructed channels and the dredging of the hundred streams, promptly dispel the relentless rains across the four borders, dissolving the dark clouds and revealing the radiant sun. May the fields and countryside rejoice in gladness, and the toil of plowing and sowing proceed with joy. May we soon witness the harvest, the white grain piled upon the threshing grounds, truly basking in the grace of protection and the bounty of life’s sustenance.

Furthermore, I pray that an edict be issued to the Four Seas and Four Rivers, the streams, springs, pools, and caverns, and all the dragon spirits and mysterious lords concerned, who oversee the departments of wind, thunder, and rain for this year and season. May all the deities be duly informed and commanded to still the winds, calm the waves, gather the rain, disperse the clouds, lift the dense gloom, and allow the sunlight to illuminate the fields. May the rice and grain be abundant, the crops and harvests reach fullness, and the year pass without care, as proof of efficacy.

**Memorial for the Averting of Fire Disasters**

Your servant, a humble and worthless being of rustic origins, a scattered pebble among timber, presumptuously occupies a place among the ranks of officials and is entrusted with the task of salvation. Daring to pour forth the prayers of a humble heart, I humbly beseech the great benevolence of creation.

Your servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, humbly considers that in serving those above and nurturing those below, we depend entirely upon our dwellings. With eaves adjoining and roofs connected, they suffice for clothing and sustenance, truly a profound benefit of life’s creation, worthy of the Supreme Emperor’s compassion.

Suddenly, in the previous court assembly, word came of a celestial anomaly, said to have fallen near the corner of a house, resembling the portent of a fire calamity. The people were seized with alarm, not knowing what to do. I privately reckon that, whether in the near term of a day or two or the longer span of ten days, there is fear of a conflagration spreading like wildfire, or the devastation of a raging inferno, extending across neighborhoods and villages. If we do not petition the Supreme Heaven for aid, how can grace flow down to the lower realms?

I humbly present this memorial, offering it to the Three Heavens, and prostrate myself in hope that Your vast and majestic compassion may extend its wondrous transformation. May You issue a special decree, commanding all divine administrators within the boundless precincts and villages to drive away the fire calamity threatening this person, banishing it to distant lands, that no misfortune or harm may befall the suffering common folk.

I reverently invoke the Nine Seas’ Northern Dark Lord, the Heavenly Elder of Upright Qi, the Star of War, the Wandering Capital, the Radiant Star, the Punisher of Calamities, and the Heavenly Prosperity Lord—each one—along with their 120 officials and generals; the River’s Jade Maidens, 1,200 in number; the Yellow-Robed Soldiers of the Great Heaven-Covering General, 100,000 strong; and the 700,000 troops of the Supreme Heavenly Lord. May they mobilize the ascending yin qi of the Net Star, dispatch the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, annihilate the demons of fire calamity, and expel the specters of fire essence. Together with the essence of the Black Emperor’s Feathered Son of the North, the true qi of Ren and Gui, and the water virtue of Grand Yin, may they restrain and extinguish the fire disaster, severing it utterly.

Furthermore, may the Wind Earl and Rain Master be commanded to descend and quench the flames with rain, while the local deities drive away the fire spirits, swiftly banishing them to distant realms. Thus may the wandering embers be removed, the villages and communities restored to peace, households remain undisturbed, and dwellings stand as before, all to manifest the imperial grace.

**Memorial for Offering Thanks and Dispelling Locusts to Protect the Fields**

I, a lowly being of dust and grass, born in this flourishing era of true teaching, have studied the Dao and received its instruction, vowing to propagate the Way and deliver humanity. I pledge to atone for faults through meritorious deeds, upholding the current and spreading transformation.

I humbly submit this memorial, reflecting the intent of the ritual, for I deeply consider that spring plowing and autumn harvests promise a year of abundance, yet earthly blight and heavenly disasters threaten to bring a year of famine. Now that locusts have erupted in swarms, and malevolent forces run rampant, devouring forests and fields alike, if I do not pour out my heart in lament and petition for divine intervention, how can the crops be safeguarded from ruin?

I humbly present this memorial, offering it to the Three Heavens, and prostrate myself in hope that Your boundless compassion may deign to heed my plea. May You issue a special decree, commanding all divine administrators within the boundless precincts to repel the locust plague, sever the malevolent qi, and carry them away on fierce winds to distant lands or sweep them off with torrential rains to other regions. May every last insect be transformed, leaving no trace, so that the fields may flourish, and a bountiful harvest be assured.

I reverently invoke the Lords of the Four Wilds, the Five Wilds, and the Nine Wilds; the Lords of Villages, Mountains, Rivers, and Altars of Soil and Grain; the Mistress of Vital Essence; the White Silkworm and Five Grains Lord; the Great Fields and Five Measures Lord; and the Six Abundance Lords—each two in number—along with their 120 officials and generals. I also invoke the Lords of Earthly Livestock, Heavenly Armor, and the Five Thousand Kings—each twelve in number—with their 120 officials and generals. May they ensure the fertility of the fields, the ripening of the Five Grains, repel locusts and crickets, and drive away rats and sparrows, so that the rice seedlings flourish and the pests flee in terror.

Together with the Lords of Altars of Soil and Grain, Mountains, Rivers, and City Walls, may they mutually safeguard the land, ensuring the crops bear fruit while the locusts depart, banished to foreign borders as a sign of efficacy.

Here ends the *Upper Scroll of the Supreme Petitions for Salvation and Amnesty*.
The *Middle Scroll of the Supreme Petitions for Salvation and Amnesty*.

**Petition to Break Open Fengdu and Unseal the Dao of Merit for the Yellow Register**

Your humble servant, [Name], of lowly rank, prostrates himself in awe and reverence, bowing his head to the ground in repeated obeisance, and respectfully submits this petition. This worthless one, a mere speck of dust and blade of grass, has undeservedly received the blessings of past virtue, fraudulently occupying a place among the ranks of the Perfected. My merits are as meager as a grain of millet, while my transgressions are as vast as the deepest abyss. Yet, by the grace of your boundless forbearance, I have not been condemned to destruction. I vow to redouble my efforts in cultivation, striving to repay even a fraction of this debt. Having received this earnest plea, how dare I not bring it to your attention?

Your servant, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent, humbly reflects: The Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Six Caverns and Ten Palaces, the dark gates of the netherworld, the trials of water and fire, the bonds of life and death—all these constrain souls to endure eternal suffering, rolling through a thousand ages. Though such is the karmic retribution of sentient beings for their deluded deeds, the compassion of the Supreme Mystery is still moved to pity. Without the grace of amnesty, how could they attain liberation?

Thus, I reverently present this petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching your mercy and compassion to bestow the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the ten directions and dispelling the darkness of the nine prisons. May the departed, [Name], along with their nine ancestral generations and seven lineages, their karmic kin from countless kalpas, and all suffering beings of the six paths and four modes of birth—every shade and spirit of the unseen realms—be bathed in this sacred qi, awakening their innate goodness. May their long-accumulated grievances and transgressions dissolve in an instant.

Your servant respectfully invokes the Flying Celestial Envoys of the Ten Directions, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of Salvation, to ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens, and request the issuance of the Primordial Mandate of the Origin and the True Talisman of Salvation. Let these be proclaimed to the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials of the Ten Directions, the Three Realms, and the Boundless Divine Realms; to the registers of yin and yang transgressions; to the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices; the hundred and twenty courts; the Northern Capital of Fengdu; the inner and outer palaces and caverns; the Avīci Hell and the Uninterrupted Hells; the great and small Iron Enclosures; the twelve river sources; the courts of the Yellow Springs; the Nine Dark Realms and Five Sacred Peaks; the wardens of punishment and retribution; the Five Sufferings and Three Paths; all the great hells; the Five Paths’ central bureaus; and the underworld offices of enforcement. By the radiance of this talisman, may iron cities crumble, torments cease, shackles and fetters fall away, and imprisoned souls be freed. May furnaces and bronze pillars transform into groves of kalpavriksha, boiling cauldrons into lotus pools, rivers of ash and embers into clear ice, mountains of swords and blades into jeweled trees. May the blazing infernos of the flaming hells and the searing peaks of diamond mountains be stilled, grievances resolved, enmities reconciled, evil roots severed, and sinful records expunged. May all departed souls be pardoned, and may the countless suffering beings of the unseen realms attain freedom. May wandering spirits and sunken souls each achieve liberation.

Further, I implore that a sagacious decree be issued to the Azure Bureau, opening the Purple Yang Jade Casket to reveal the name of the Compassionate Savior of Manifest Transformation. May the Dharma flow throughout the ten directions, and may all beings return to refuge. May the gates of the Dao be flung wide, and may the burdened households be swiftly delivered. Thus, may the virtuous be enveloped in the mist of auspicious clouds, and may the numinous efficacy be abundantly manifest. May all equally partake in the blessings of creation, serving as a sign of your boundless grace.

Your foolish servant, relying upon the Direct Envoys of the Two Bureaus, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Left and Right Bureau Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Talisman Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale Courier Clerks, the Post-Horse Petition Clerks, the Flying Dragon Mount Clerks, the Phoenix Mounts for Petition Delivery, the Cloud Dragon Mounts for Petition Ascent, the Wind-Swift Mounts for Petition Dispatch, the Divine Dragon Mounts for Imperial Petitions, and the Flying Dragon and Flying Tiger Mounts for Memorial Submission—each accompanied by two attendants—now dispatches them.

On behalf of the sponsor of this retreat, [Name], I present this *Petition to Break Open Fengdu and Unseal the Dao of Merit*, submitting it to the Courts of the Three Heavens. I humbly pray that the celestial grace may grant its response.

With awe and reverence, I prostrate myself, bowing my head to the ground in repeated obeisance, and respectfully submit this petition.

The text shall be written in single columns, with each line containing seventeen characters. On the first sheet, the back shall have two lines, leaving the third line blank before writing the title of the petition in an overlapping manner. Below this, write: *"Your humble servant, [Name], prostrates himself in awe and reverence, bowing his head to the ground in repeated obeisance."*

This line shall not be written on the back. The length may vary as needed. On the fourth line, write *"respectfully submits this petition"* (上言), indented one cun from the title. This line shall then be written on the back with seventeen characters. From *"respectfully submits this petition"* onward, each line shall follow the prescribed format, leaving half a space at the top and ensuring no continuation at the bottom.

The name of the petitioner shall be written as a single character, without splitting it across lines. Characters such as *ghost* (鬼), *inauspicious* (凶), *death* (死), *thief* (贼), or any other ill-omened words shall not appear at the top of a line. Conversely, characters such as *immortal* (仙), *person* (人), *life* (生), or other auspicious words shall not appear at the bottom of a line.

At the conclusion, append the following:
*"I humbly beseech the Supreme Mystery to distinguish and heed this plea.

Three blank lines follow, then the text is written in staggered form:

This line shall be written on the reverse side, measuring four inches and eight fen in length.

Three blank lines follow, then from the middle of the line is written:

The remainder of the line shall align with the bottom edge of the paper, leaving all space after the year of the Great Year blank.

The petition must not be written across days, and the Great Dao’s title must not be filled in across hours. Thus, the hour, the dot after "Palace," and the character *"submit"* within *"submit this petition"* are left blank.

**Petition for the White Horse and Plain Chariot**

Your servant, by nature dull and clumsy, endowed with foolish simplicity, holds the office of salvation yet dares not neglect his duty to report. I humbly beseech the exalted and enlightened to graciously pardon my reckless presumption.

In accordance with the intent of the sponsor, and as my office entails the transmission of the teachings, I cannot justly refuse. Thus, I reverently select this [Day] day of the present [Month] month to solemnly establish a sacred altar at [Location], proceeding in accordance with the true precepts and their prescribed order.

I earnestly reflect: the Nine Dark Realms, Six Caverns, Three Officials, and Northern Fengdu; the shadowy paths and hidden passes of the underworld—all are governed by officials who examine and judge. Without the proclamation of the Azure Vault, how could the spirits and souls of the departed be released from their bonds?

I respectfully submit this petition to the Courts of the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching compassion and merciful pity. May the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend to illuminate the dark realms, brightening the nightly abodes. Thereby, may the deceased [Name], together with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages of kin, all karmic relations across kalpas, the six paths and four modes of birth, and every class of suffering shade—be freed from their fetters of suffering. May they come before the sacred altar to receive rank and ascend through salvation.

I reverently invoke:
- Twelve Great Generals of the White Horse and Plain Chariot, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;
- Twelve Envoys of the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;
- Twelve Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery, with one hundred twenty officials and generals;
- Twelve Direct Talismanic Envoys of the Supreme Mystery, with one hundred twenty officials and generals.

May they ascend to the Golden Watchtower and Jade Palace of the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of the *Precious Register of the Most High for Pardon and Ascent to Heaven*. Let this proclamation be issued to the ten directions, three realms, boundless divine realms, Northern Fengdu, the Courts of the Yellow Springs, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the one hundred twenty offices, the palaces of water and fire, yin and yang, the inner and outer caverns, the thirty-six prisons, the Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering, the great and lesser Iron Enclosures, the pools of flame and lakes of ice, the Four Waterways and Five Sacred Peaks, the twelve river sources, the examining officials of the Five Emperors, the clerks of the Six Palaces, the mighty heavenly warriors, the divine soldiers who execute punishments, the recorders of merit and fate, the judges of crimes and sins, the wardens of prisons and transgressions, the Four Luminous Lords, the Gatekeepers of Heaven, the Ten Palaces and Six Caverns, the Great Demons of the Five Emperors, the mighty spirits of the Netherworld, the Five Paths and Capital Offices, the Terrace of Darkness and the Borders of the Underworld, the ghostly officials of the Eternal Night, and the infinite yin courts—all are commanded to heed and obey.

At the site of this altar’s establishment, talismanic mandates shall be issued, and guards shall escort and receive the aforementioned departed souls. May all sufferings be swept away, the hells be departed, the eternal night be left behind, and the light be beheld. May the Black Registers be burned, the roots of karmic debt be scattered, and the souls ascend to the sacred seat to undergo refinement and rebirth, as proof of efficacy.

**Petition for the Opening of Roads**

Your servant, dull-witted and benighted, presumptuously holds a sacred office, undeserving of such great favor. I dare to exhaust my humble devotion, offering but a fraction of my sincerity.

In accordance with the sponsor’s intent, and as my office entails the transmission of the teachings, I cannot justly refuse. Thus, I reverently select this [Day] day of the present [Month] month to solemnly establish a sacred altar at [Location], proceeding in accordance with the true precepts and their prescribed order.

I deeply consider: the wandering souls and scattered consciousnesses, as they traverse the roads and passes, may encounter obstacles. Without the edict of the Supreme Mystery, how could the paths be opened?

I respectfully submit this petition to the Courts of the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching compassion and merciful pity. May the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend to open the shadowy paths, illuminating the boundless dark. Thereby, may the deceased [Name], together with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages of kin, all karmic relations across kalpas, the six paths and four modes of birth, and every class of suffering shade—depart from their abodes and come to attend the altar. May their sins be absolved, the dark realms be traversed, and the true ones be approached for refinement.

I reverently invoke:
- Twelve Direct Talismanic Envoys of the Supreme Mystery;
- Twelve Envoys of the Great Unity;
- Twelve Direct Talismanic Envoys of the Five Emperors;
- Twelve Heralding Riders of the Ten Heavens;
- Twelve Envoys of the Golden Dragon and Reed Dragon of the Mysterious Capital;
- Twelve Envoys of the Jade Dragon and Flying Dragon.

Each shall be accompanied by one hundred twenty officials and generals. May they ascend to the Golden Watchtower and Jade Palace of the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of the *Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence*, the *Purple Yang Precious Seal*, the *Qi of Life of the Five Directions*, and the *Ten Heavenly Precious Talismans*. Let the dark yin be illuminated, the eternal night be brightened, and the proclamation be issued to the celestial prisons and earthly hells, the watery courts of the yin, the underworld bureaus, the Six Paths of the Yellow Springs, the Nine Ramparts of Northern Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Dark Realms, the Ten Palaces of the Five Sacred Peaks, the earth gods of the nine provinces, the blessed lands of the grotto-heavens, the examining clerks, the Elder of the Grave Mounds, the Tomb Lords, the River Lords and River Spirits, the officials beneath the earth, the honored spirits of the Yearly Virtue, the elders of mountains and forests, the spirits of springs and streams, the hidden passes of the underworld, the deities of blood sacrifices, the city gods and village earth gods, and all governing offices. May all heed the celestial talismans, obey the proclamations, absolve grievances and remove sins, open the roads and clear the way. May the aforementioned departed souls be released, their forms and rites restored, proceeding in order to the altar to hear the Dharma, approach the true ones, receive the precepts and talismans, and partake in the merit. May the night of darkness know no peril, the gates of the underworld yield to freedom, and the summons be unhindered—this as proof of efficacy.

**Summons for the Departed Souls**

This humble servant, dull-witted and unlearned, has presumptuously undertaken the propagation of the luminous precepts and the exaltation of the wondrous transformation. Relying upon the majesty of the sagely might and presenting the meager offerings of this foolish one, I humbly beseech your boundless compassion to deign to regard this petition.

In accordance with the supplicant’s intent and the duties of my office, which brook no refusal, I have respectfully chosen the day of [specific date] in the month of [specific month] to solemnly establish the Mystic Altar at [specific location], proceeding in accordance with the true precepts and their prescribed order.

This servant deeply fears that the vastness of the underworld’s paths and the desolation of its dark roads may render them bleak and bewildering. Without the awe of the summons, how could the governance of the Divine Tiger be manifest? Therefore, I reverently adhere to the *Secret Methods of the Supreme Unity Divine Tiger*, proclaiming the *Supreme Unity Mystic Underworld Jade Talisman and Divine Tiger Mandate*. The Iron-Trace Terrace shines with radiance, the precious script is established, and the Divine Tiger’s summons is fixed at the appointed hour of the altar. By this, I command the pursuit and summoning of the departed one, [name], together with the nine ancestral generations and seven forefathers, the karmic kin of countless kalpas, the myriad beings of the six paths and four births, and all categories of hidden souls. May they be visibly received by their living kin, their divine mechanism revealed in splendor.

I humbly present this memorial, that it may ascend to the Three Heavens. May your compassion incline to mercy, and may you specially bestow the *Qi of the Jade Clarity Dao*, the wondrous light of the *Numinous Treasure*, to illumine the dark passes without hindrance. May the *Jade Talisman Mandate* shine with resplendent brilliance, and may the underworld officials and hidden bureaus reverently heed and obey.

I reverently invoke:
- The *Northern Culmen Mystic Model*, the inner true ones of the Divine Tiger;
- The *Mighty Left of the Male*, who governs the hundred joints;
- The *Three Hun Talisman Officials* and the *Jade Bureau of Myriad Mechanisms*;
- The *Mystic Elder Female Right Martial Simurgh*;
- The *Director of the Reversed Life Mystic Bureau*, who grasps the hun and seizes the po;
- The *Master Officials of the Flying Talismans and Jade Mandates*;
- The *Summoning Hun Envoys of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Realms*;
- The *Envoys who pursue the three hun of the seven ancestral generations*;
- The *Jade Maidens of the Upper Origin*, who pursue the souls of those lost to wounds, leprosy, convulsions, poisoning, dysentery, miasmic fevers, and malarial spirits;
- The *Jade Maidens of the Middle Origin*, who pursue the souls of those without kin, lost to consumption, paralysis, and wind-borne afflictions;
- The *Jade Maidens of the Lower Origin*, who pursue the souls of those lost to pestilence, thunderous wrath, and sudden calamities;
- The *Jade Talisman Jade Maidens*, who pursue the souls of those lost to fright, hanging, blade execution, self-strangulation, drowning, immolation, childbirth, and defiling curses;
- The *Jade Maidens of the Pristine Turtle and Pure Grasp*, who pursue the souls of those lost to poison, malevolent hexes, incantations, blade wounds, banditry, royal punishment, and harm by beasts;
- The *Jade Maidens of the Ninefold Mystic Terrace*, who pursue the souls of those imprisoned for crimes.

May the *Jade Maidens of the Orthodox Unity Life-Prolonging Six Jia Hidden Heaven Numinous Talismans* swiftly descend, receive the talismans, proclaim the virtue, and summon the po to call back the hun.

Furthermore, I invoke:
- The *Great General of the Left Guard of the Cinnabar Heaven*;
- The *Divine Lads Who Open the Dao of the Five Directions*;
- The *Dao Lords of the Ten Directions*;
- The *Merit Officers of the Six Paths*;
- The *Summoning Hun Envoys of the Three Realms*;
- The *Celestial Perfected of the Heavenly Cavern*, pure and serene;
- The *Great Generals Who Seek the Hun, Summon the Po, Confront the Hun, and Gather the Hun*—may they as one descend to assist this servant in summoning the aforementioned departed souls.

May they gather the spirits and restore the qi, returning to the yang abode. May they raise the banner and manifest their forms, communicate through dreams, and ascend to glorify the Dao’s transformation while consoling the grief of the living. May they receive refinement and bear the talismans, hear the scriptures and listen to the Dharma, erase their sins in the *Northern Gloom*, and inscribe their true names in the *Southern Cinnabar*. May they ascend at the appointed hour as proof of efficacy.

**Purification and Healing Petition**

This humble servant, a speck of dust and leaky vessel, a lowly creature like an ant, has presumptuously assumed the rank of proclaiming virtue and dared not neglect the canon of delivering beings. The awe-inspiring countenance is majestic; may your regard and hearing be granted.

**Purification and Healing Petition (Continued)**

This humble servant, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent and bound by the duty of transmitting the teachings, finds it impossible to refuse. Thus, beginning on the [day] of the [month], I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding in accordance with the true rites and their prescribed order.

I deeply consider that the aforementioned departed souls, confined in the gloom of the underworld and ensnared by yin filth, may only achieve clarity of form and spirit through the purifying flow of divine springs. Therefore, I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching your compassion to look upon them with mercy. May you specially bestow the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of Numinous Treasure, immersing the Orchid Pool in their effulgence, that the departed—[name] and their nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, all karmic relations across kalpas, and the myriad categories of suffering spirits in the six paths and four modes of birth—may have their turbid obstructions dissolved, their forms and spirits cleansed and luminous, their six viscera illuminated, and not a speck of dust remain.

I reverently invoke:
- The Jade Maiden of the Eastern Well,
- The Lady of the Flowery Pool,
- The Jade Maidens of Washing and Cleansing,
- The Officers of the Bathing Lords,
- One Sun Child and one Moon Child,
- One hundred and twenty Officers of the Five Directions’ Purification, to descend as one.

May they transform the Yellow Flower Pool of the Eastern Well and the Flowing Marsh of the Western Fields, drawing the Fat of the Stone Radiance King, the divine waters of the Yellow Flower, the true qi of the Five Directions, the sacred herbs of the sun and moon, the golden nectar of sweet dew, and the jade liqueur of cloud marrow. May these bathe and refine the departed souls, washing away sinful dust, dissolving karmic grime, purging the filth of the womb and birth, and clearing the miasma of grievances, debts, and afflictions.

Furthermore, I invoke:
- The Azure Spirit Elder of the East, to nourish with the ninefold azure essence,
- The Cinnabar Spirit Perfected of the South, to nourish with the threefold cinnabar splendor,
- The Luminous Yellow Elder of the West, to nourish with the sevenfold white nectar,
- The Mystic Spirit Elder of the North, to nourish with the fivefold dark elixir,
- The Yellow Spirit Elder of the Center, to nourish with the singular yellow essence,
that their hun-souls may be stabilized, their po-souls pacified, and their five viscera naturally regenerated.

I further invoke:
- The hundredfold-tempered Vajra,
- The thousandfold-harmonized Jade Elixir,
- The flowing radiance of Venus,
- The scattered essence of the Primordial Sovereign,
to dispel stagnation and vexation, purge dregs and filth, and render body and mind pure, wisdom luminous.

I also invoke:
- The Divine Physicians of Heaven,
- The Numinous Officers of Medicines,
- The Three and Five Merit Officials,
- The Celestial Medical Masters,
- The Stone-Needle Lesser Officers,
- The Medicine-Spreading Divine Lads,
to secretly circulate the ninefold-transformed sacred herbs and the five-colored divine medicines, dispersing them through the meridians and viscera. May they heal the ailments of the departed souls’ former lives, their chronic afflictions, and lingering maladies, restoring their spirits to wholeness, their limbs to purity, and granting them rebirth through transformation as proof of efficacy.

**Petition for the Universal Salvation of Suffering Souls**

This unworthy servant, though ranked among the true immortals, has done little to aid the Dao’s transformation. Yet I pledge my heart to the teachings and strive to deliver beings. I dare to present this humble offering before your awe-inspiring presence, prostrating myself in boundless reverence.

In accordance with the intent of this fast, bound by the duty of transmitting the teachings, I find it impossible to refuse. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this month, I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location] and proceed in due order.

I have observed that in the dark passes of the underworld, countless lost souls linger—some swept away by water or fire, some slain by weapons or treachery, some crushed by trees or stones, some executed by the blade, some long afflicted by hunger and cold, some poisoned by toxins, some slaughtered by bandits, some devoured by serpents or beasts, some subjected to the cruelest punishments, some struck down by thunder, some crushed in carriage falls or horseback tumbles, some hanged or drowned, some perished in foreign lands, some fallen in battle, some seized by spirits, some entangled in karmic grievances, some maimed by sores, lameness, deafness, or blindness, some stricken by miasmas, plagues, or paralysis, some lost in childbirth, some cut down by illness, some burdened by ancient resentments, some consumed by sorrow and anger, some yet unenlightened by the Dao’s grace, some never pardoned despite repeated amnesties. Countless names remain forsaken, myriad lineages sunk in suffering. They haunt the mountains and forests, lurk in the wilds, drift without refuge—truly pitiable. Only through the Yellow Register’s revelation of Heaven’s mercy and the underworld’s compassionate decree may they glimpse the hope of deliverance.

Though I have received the jade talismans and proclaimed the great amnesty, I fear the merit may not yet extend to the dark realms. Therefore, in accordance with the *Dao of Delivering the Limitless*, on the night of the [day] of this month, I shall conduct the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital, presenting pure offerings upon the Jade Mountain. I shall summon the suffering souls of all categories—those slain across the nine provinces and ten realms, the six paths and four modes of birth—inviting them to partake of the feast, undergo refinement, escape suffering, and ascend as immortals. Without the great Dao’s compassion, how could these multitudes attain liberation?

I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching your mercy to look upon them with pity. May you bestow the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of Numinous Treasure, filling the ten directions and illuminating the nine wilds, reaching from the highest heavens to the lowest depths, guiding all beings to the Dharma feast. May their sins be washed away, their grievances dissolved, their forms refined, and their natures transformed.

I reverently invoke:
- The Great Brahma Numinous Officers of Jade Clarity’s Lustral Waters,
- The Azure Mystery and Yellow Register Officers of Salvation and Merit,
- Thirty-two Jade Lads and Maidens,
- One hundred Immortal Clerks,
to ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of the Primordial Sovereign’s compassion, the auspicious sweet dew, and the banners of pardon, bearing the Heavenly Mercy.

May they descend as one, chanting spells to scatter the sweet dew, universally transforming the feast’s vessels, filling the boundless void. May all suffering spirits partake to their fill, their hunger sated, their thirst quenched, each responding to the call.

I rely upon:
- The Mandate of the Primordial Beginning,
- The Golden Register and White Tablet,
- The True Talisman of Salvation,
- The Luminous Talisman of Eternal Life,
- The Precious Register of Ascending to Heaven,
- The Eastern Flowery Azure Palace,
- The Nine Dragon Mandates,
- The Jeweled Net of Radiance,
to deliver all sunken souls, regardless of their path or mode of birth, refining them through the Yellow Register. May the undelivered be delivered, the unborn be born, the unascended ascend, the untransformed be transformed. May they receive their talismans and contracts, return from yin to yang, and transcend the realms of humans and heavens as proof of efficacy.

**Chapter on Ninefold Refinement for Ascending as Immortals and Delivering the Departed Spirits**

This humble servant’s Dao remains unpervaded by the Mysterious, his virtue far from attaining subtlety. Repeatedly, he petitions on behalf of others, yet trembles in self-reproach, ever reliant upon boundless grace, ever entreating lenient forbearance.

In accordance with the intent of this fast, this servant’s duty lies solely in presiding over the teachings—how could he dare refuse? Thus, beginning on the appointed day of this month, he reverently establishes a Mysterious Altar at the designated place, proceeding in due order with the rites.

This servant deeply fears that the aforementioned departed spirits, long sunken in yin’s darkness, are easily severed from yang’s light. Without the refining power of the Yellow Flower, how may they ascend to the Azure Vault as perfected beings?

On the chosen night, he shall follow the *Lingbao* Great Rites of Boundless Deliverance, unfolding the Five Scripts and performing the Ninefold Refinement. First, he presents a memorial, ascending it to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching compassion to incline toward mercy. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the *Lingbao*’s wondrous radiance descend, suffusing the Mysterious Altar with luminous brilliance. Thus may the aforementioned departed spirits bathe their forms in sacred light, their hearts cleansed of yin’s filth, their essences refined through water and fire, their inner and outer selves made whole.

He reverently invokes:
- The Deathless Venerable of the Southern Palace, Deliverer of Humankind,
- The Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,
- The Marshal of Deliverance, Controller of the World,
- The True Lord Han Jun, Lover of Life,
- The Registrars of Life and Destiny of the Southern Bureau,
- The Venerable Deliverer from Calamity, Restorer of Bones and Reviver of the Dead,
- The Boundless Deliverer of Humankind, True Lord of the Southern Palace,
to inscribe the departed’s allotted lifespan in golden script and fix their names upon jade tablets.

He further invokes:
- The Immortal Officers of the Great Unity’s Salvation,
- The Immortal Officers of the Golden Watchtower’s Manifestations,
- The Immortal Officers of the Vermilion Mound’s Deliverance,
- The Immortal Officers of Carefree Joy,
- The Immortal Officers of Precious Flower’s Perfection,
- The Jade Bureau of Refinement and Deliverance,
- The Immortal Officers of the *Lingbao*,
- Jade Lads and Jade Maidens,
- Generals and Envoys,
- Merit Officers and Chief Scribes,
to ascend to the Golden Watchtower’s Jade Steps beneath the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of:
- The Primordial Beginning’s Mandate,
- The Golden Register and White Tablet,
- The Talisman of Eternal Life,
- The Jade Characters of Inner Sound,
- The Vermilion Script of True Writ,
- The Yellow Register’s Precious Edict of Ascension,
to the altar’s precincts.

Thus may the departed, surnamed so-and-so, be delivered from Fengdu’s defilement and the netherworld’s gloom, their karmic roots severed, their sinful records burned. May the Five Portals be traversed, the Three Corpses slain, the Dharma Bridge erected, and the cloud realms turned back. May the Yellow Flower’s precious well be opened, the Flowing Fire’s divine court established, their yang spirits refined, and yin’s shadows dispelled. May they ascend to the Vermilion Palace above, enter the Radiant Opening below, restore the myriad spirits, and regenerate the Nine Qi. Clad in the vestments of celestial ascent, riding the lotus’s precious chariot, may they proceed to the Heavenly Gates, pay homage at the Golden Watchtower, roam freely in bliss, and merge with the Dao in truth, forever freed from the sorrow of rebirth, ever abiding in the radiance of flourishing fortune.

**Chapter on the Fengdu Pardon of Sins for the Illumination of the True Fast**

This servant, born in a defiled age yet blessed to live in an era of prosperity, bears the registers and delves into the Mysterious, transmits the scriptures and awakens to the Dao. He vows to deliver humankind and uphold the teachings, striving to atone for faults and establish merit. How could he forget to report and petition for all who seek refuge?

In accordance with the intent of this fast, this servant reflects: the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Six Caves and Ten Palaces, the Thirty-Six Prisons, the Iron Enclosure’s primordial bounds, the Yellow Springs’ winding depths, the Five Sufferings and Three Paths, the Nine Netherworlds and Five Peaks—all govern decrees and examine transgressions.

Foolish worldly beings, ignorant of right principle, accumulate karmic debts and indulge in evil, committing wrongs. Thus their names are bound to the Northern Fengdu, their souls consigned to the netherworld’s night, imprisoned in yin’s dungeons, fettered for eternity, enduring unrelenting torment with no hope of release. Without the Mysterious and Void’s gracious pardon, how could their sinful retributions be dissolved?

He presents a memorial, ascending it to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the Great Virtue’s love for life, whose boundless benevolence extends everywhere. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the *Lingbao*’s wondrous radiance descend, illuminating the Ten Directions and brightening the Three Realms. May the netherworld’s gates and shadowed paths gleam with resplendent light, instantly purifying the earth-bound sinful spirits.

Thus may the aforementioned departed spirits emerge from the abyss of night, behold the dawn’s sunlight, awaken their good hearts, recognize their past lives, repent their faults, and advance in virtue, escaping suffering to attain rebirth.

This servant reverently invokes the Talisman Officers of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, along with the Lads of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, each one, to respectfully request the Great Ultimate’s True Talisman. May it be proclaimed to the Great Compassionate One of the Heavenly Center’s Ever-Joyful Palace in the Eastern Culmen, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity’s Salvation Who Responds to Cries, to descend with majestic power and radiant wisdom, universally illuminating the Ten Directions’ worlds, the deepest yin’s layered darkness, and the Northern Capital’s icy pools. May every prison become a realm of yang, iron cities crumble, and fetters fall away. May the departed, surnamed so-and-so, be pardoned of all sins, their grievances dissolved, their disputes resolved. May the hells witness this light and rely upon its grace.

May the Heavenly Worthies and Sagely Beings summon the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Kings, the Salvation Perfected, the Salvation Lads, and the Azure Mystery Jade Maidens to descend upon the netherworld’s prisons. May they shower the Dharma’s compassionate rain and sprinkle the sweet dew’s precious nectar, transforming ice and snow into spring, extinguishing flames and smoke. May blades become jade trees, swords turn into forests of *jian* trees, and the cold’s bitter chill instantly vanish. May boiling cauldrons and copper pillars become cool, jailers and Ox-Headed Demons awaken to kindness, and copper serpents and iron dogs forever cease their malevolence. May the courts’ records of interrogation be erased, the bureaus’ ledgers of karmic retribution burned. Even those condemned to:
- driving thunder and wielding lightning,
- dredging the Qi and Ji rivers,
- bearing stones and hauling sand,
- circling the Heavenly Round,
- tunneling earth to draw water,
- harnessing winds to sweep mountains,
shall all partake of the wondrous transformation. May those bound to earthly labor be delivered to the Southern Palace above. In response to these earnest prayers, may they be granted the boon of upliftment.

**Chapter on Bathing and Refinement for Deliverance**

This servant, a base being of dust and a humble life of the wilds, was mistakenly shaped by the potter’s hand and elevated to rank. Wholly dependent upon the perfection of the Mysterious Completion, how could he forget his private duty of requital? He vows to rescue the sunken and strive to fulfill meritorious deeds.

**Chapter on Bathing and Refinement for Deliverance**

This servant, in accordance with the intent of the fast, holds the duty of teaching and guiding—how could he dare refuse? Thus, beginning on a certain day of this month, he reverently establishes a Mysterious Altar at a designated place, following the true precepts in due order to perform the rites.

This servant deeply considers: those who have long dwelt in the depths of the Yellow Springs, traversing the shadowy paths of the netherworld, are enveloped in yin vapors and entangled in karmic filth. Countless beings, their souls cast into the cold courts, their spirits returned to the night’s abyss, are shrouded in gloom, their purity obscured by murk. Though talismans and decrees have been issued to summon and gather them, those lost in the dark realms may never ascend to the celestial audience. Without bathing in the divine springs, how could their forms and souls be cleansed?

Thus, this servant respectfully presents a memorial to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the great virtue of the Dao, whose boundless benevolence extends to all. May the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure descend, illuminating the Orchid Pool with divine transformation and mystical elixir. May the departed, [name], be granted to bathe in virtue and wash away dust, purifying both inner and outer darkness, dispelling the heat and afflictions of body and spirit. May they ascend to attend the true ones and hear the Dharma, their lives delivered to the Mystery.

This servant respectfully invokes:
- Five Divine Lads of the Five Directions, five each;
- One hundred twenty Officers of Impurity-Cleansing;
- One Yellow Flower Lady of Bathing, and one Jade Maiden of Washing.

May they descend at once to draw the sacred waters of the Yellow Flower, refine the plain fluids of the corpse, and infuse the Orchid Bath with sweet dew, golden nectar, cloud-fat, and jade wine. May the departed, [name], be bathed therein, their toils and dust washed away, their sins and obstacles dissolved. May their five viscera and six bowels be made clear, their nine orifices and four limbs wholly purified.

This servant further invokes:
- The Great Generals of Water and Fire;
- The Stone Radiance Water Mother;
- The Flowing Essence Jade Maiden;
- The Nine Radiance Lads;
- The Fire Bell Divine Lads;
- The True Hosts of the Azure Mystery Refinement.

May they gather the flowing fire of the Southern Prosperity Vermilion Mound and the surging waters of the Eastern Well Yellow Flower Pool, uniting true water and true fire to descend. May they refine and wash away the impurities of the departed, [name], purifying their accumulated grime, that they may be adorned for deliverance, ascend as immortals, and forever dwell in the unconditioned, beyond the wheel of rebirth.

**Chapter on Ascending and Delivering the Departed**

This unworthy servant, of coarse substance and meager talent, has been graced by the resplendent favor of my teacher and fortunate to glimpse the subtle. How could I repay the radiant power of the Emperor? I aspire to widely propagate deliverance and gloriously assist in the work of creation.

In accordance with the intent of the fast, this servant holds the duty of teaching and guiding—how could he dare refuse? Thus, beginning on a certain day of this month, he reverently establishes a Mysterious Altar at a designated place, following the true precepts in due order to perform the rites.

This servant deeply considers: the departed soul, long sunken in the yin realms, has glimpsed the light of yang. Without deliverance to return to life, how could they attain transcendence and freedom?

Thus, this servant respectfully presents a memorial to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the great Dao, whose boundless benevolence extends to all. May the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure descend, illuminating the Mysterious Void and brightening the altar. May the departed soul, [name], bathe in the divine light and rejoice, riding the refinement to roam freely.

This servant respectfully invokes:
- The Lord of Life of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace;
- The Lord of Records;
- The Lord of Extended Longevity;
- The Lord of Increased Lifespan;
- The Lord of Deliverance from Calamity;
- The Lord of Delivering People from Death;
- The Lord of Southern Culmen and Eternal Life;
- The Marshal of Delivering the World;
- The Venerable Lord of Compassion;
- The Boundless Lord of Reviving the Dead and Delivering All.

May they deliver the departed, [name], first into the Yellow Flower Treasure Well, then into the Flowing Fire Divine Court, to wash their essence and refine their form, dispelling yin impurities. May they embrace the true qi of the Nine Heavens and be bathed in the divine radiance of the Five Emperors. May their qi and form be made whole, their spirit restored. May they ride the wind chariot to the Azure Heavens, their feathered carriage to the Great Clarity, ascending through the Celestial Gate. May they receive their tally and seal, forever free from the wheel of rebirth, eternally roaming in freedom, reborn through transformation as a sign of efficacy.

**Chapter on Translocating and Delivering the Departed**
*(For the Translocation Ritual Altar)*

This servant’s fortune was early endowed, and I rejoice in encountering this flourishing era. Having received the registers, advanced in rank, transmitted the scriptures, and received the Dao, I am deeply ashamed of my meager virtue, unable to fathom the subtle and profound. My transgressions are many, my merits few. Yet I have been blessed by the grace of creation and entrusted with the precepts of deliverance. I strive to cultivate and practice, hoping to repay even a fraction of this debt. With reverence, I present this memorial for your consideration.

In accordance with the intent of the fast, this servant holds the duty of teaching and guiding—how could he dare refuse? Thus, beginning on a certain day of this month, he reverently establishes a Mysterious Altar at a designated place, following the true precepts in due order to perform the rites.

This servant deeply considers: the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Six Caves and Ten Palaces, the springs of the Yellow River, the sources of the Feng and Tai mountains—all scrutinize good and evil without the slightest error. Yet the beings of this impure world, unaware of cultivation, are driven by the six senses, three karmas, five desires, and seven emotions. They wander in darkness, ceaselessly chasing illusions, until their souls return to the dark courts, their spirits to the shadowy gates. Bound by grievances and judged in the courts, they languish in the endless night—deeply pitiable. Without the compassion of the sagely ones, how could the foolish below escape the suffering of sinking?

Thus, this servant respectfully presents a memorial to the Three Heavens, humbly beseeching the Dao and its virtue to extend boundless mercy. May the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure descend, illuminating the gloom and brightening the dark prisons. May the departed, [name], behold this divine radiance, recall their past lives, abandon evil, and turn toward goodness, escaping suffering to ascend anew.

This servant respectfully invokes:
- Twelve Lads of the Twelve Yang Gates of Opening Light;
- One Heavenly Way Merit Officer;
- Nine Merit Officers of the Nine Heavens’ Cloud Path;
- One hundred twenty Divine Lads and Jade Maidens of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, tasked with support and guidance.

May they wield the talismans of the Most High for Translocating Spirits, unfurl the guiding banners, and lead the departed soul beneath the light of yang. May they point the way to ascend the cloud paths, roaming the great void forever, never to sink again.

**Chapter on Cleansing the Blood Pool**
*(For the Blood Pool Ritual Altar)*

This humble servant, born of dust and mire, a lowly creature of the wilds, has presumptuously defiled the ranks of the ordained and rashly assumed the office of salvation—unable to repay the virtue of my creation, I vow to proclaim the benevolence of transformation and nurture. For all who take refuge, how dare I neglect their supplications?

With reverent intent, I strike the ritual chime. I deeply reflect upon the departed, [name], who bears the burdens of three lives and four debts, having amassed grievous transgressions. The six desires and seven emotions readily invite offense and fault. Their fate entangled in the perils of childbirth, their spirit cast into the dark gates—recorded by name in the courts of Fengdu and Mount Tai, interrogated in body and soul within the prisons of the Gorge Stone and Blood Pool—suffering eternal pain with no means of deliverance. Yet, recalling the very origin of their existence, who is not a spark of ancestral qi? Though their karmic misdeeds were self-inflicted, they are truly pitiable. The Emperor’s grace knows no bounds; I implore your compassion.

I humbly present this memorial, to ascend to the Three Heavens. May you deign to extend your favor to the Yellow Springs, graciously peruse this plea, and specially descend the qi of the Jade Purity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the ten directions and piercing the long night. Transform the gloom of yin into the brightness of yang, and the Blood Pool into a realm of purity and clarity. May all imprisoned souls recall their past lives, abandon evil, turn toward goodness, escape suffering, and ascend anew.

I respectfully invoke:
- One Flowing Light of the Three Qi Talisman Officer;
- One Blood Pool Purification Talisman Officer;
- Twenty-four Official Generals for each.

May they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of the Flowing Light of the Three Qi, the True Talismans and Jade Primes, to purify the Blood Pool. Upon the proclamation of the True Talismans, may the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain of Fengdu, the Gorge Stone, the Blood Pool Hell—without exception—be bathed in the brilliance of talismanic light, dispelling the darkness of the nether realms. I pray that the departed, [name], and all those imprisoned by the calamities of childbirth, who have yet to escape, be swiftly absolved of their sin ledgers, their evil roots severed, their grievances resolved, and their consciousness liberated. By this talismanic decree, may they break free from the paths of darkness, approach the sacred altar, hear the scriptures, and receive the Dharma. May their forms be restored, their essences revived, and their rebirths determined by their karma.

Yet, mindful that their forms and spirits remain tainted by blood and filth, unfit to approach the radiance of the Three Treasures, I respectfully invoke:
- One Purification Lord of the Five Directions and Five Emperors for each;
- Twenty-four Jade Maiden Envoys for each;
- One Great General of the Nine Phoenixes for Breaking Filth;
- One Great General for Purifying Filth;
- One Great General for Washing Filth;
- One Great General for Eradicating Filth;
- Twenty-four Official Generals for each;
- One Lord of the Eastern Well for Ritual Bathing;
- Twenty-four Official Generals;
- One Yellow Flower Jade Maiden for Washing;
- One Jade Maiden for Purification;
- One hundred twenty Flower Maidens of the Immortals.

May they descend together, drawing the divine waters of the Yellow Flower, refining the corpse’s essence into sweet dew, golden nectar, cloud-fat, and jade liqueur, to be poured into the orchid-scented bath. May they bathe the departed, [name], washing away the defilements of childbirth, purifying the foulness of blood, so that their inner and outer selves shine with light, their forms and spirits become pure and clear, and the dust, karma, and grime of their roots be wholly cleansed.

Further mindful that at the moment of the departed’s passing, they endured agony and poison, their vital and protective qi wounded and exhausted, without attaining peace or healing, I respectfully invoke:
- One Divine Physician of the Celestial Healers;
- One Numinous Official of the Supreme Medicines;
- One Merit Officer for Treating Illness;
- One Grand Master of the Imperial Physicians.

May they descend together, secretly wielding their divine and sacred arts, administering the essence of the sun and moon, jade mushrooms, golden liqueurs, and five-colored elixirs, to heal all afflictions. May their yin and yang flow unimpeded, their blood and qi harmonized, their meridians restored to their origin, their souls and spirits purified and rectified. May they ascend to the presence of the True Ones, receive the Dharma, and be reborn in the realms of humans or heavens, forever free from the fear of sinking, dwelling in the boundless light.

Moreover, may the radiance of the Dao shine resplendently, its wisdom flowing universally, the sea of karma stilled, the waves of the Blood Pool calmed. May all beings and creatures receive the grace of creation, the sun of transformation spread across the Three Paths, and the winds of benevolence reach the eight directions.

**Chapter on Refining the Corpse to Birth the Immortal**
*(For the Fivefold Refinement of the Corpse Ritual Fast)*

This servant, fortunate to rely upon past causes, has presumptuously aided the wondrous transformation. I vow to broadly proclaim salvation and humbly assist in the work of creation. Though my transgressions run deep as abysses, my merits are as fleeting as a hair’s breadth. I beseech your boundless grace, deigning to bestow your forbearance.

I prostrate myself to honor my late master, [name], who in life bore the destiny of [year, month, day, hour], wore the scripture of [title], received the register of [title], served the Dharma as [office], and practiced austerities at [oratory]. A novice with shallow Daoist learning, their immortal rank unfulfilled, they could not ascend the void or soar the heavens. In accordance with the rites of salvation, on [year, month, day], their body entered the Great Yin, having lived [age] years. Following the standards of the Three Caverns’ immortal salvation, their garments, pillow, and mat were inscribed with sacred talismans to guard their corpse. Further adhering to the Fivefold Refinement of the Corpse for Salvation, the precious scriptures and jade texts of the True Writ were installed in the five directions to protect their spirit. Their burial awaits an auspicious day, their form entrusted to the Earth Bureau.

Should the burial remain pending, I fear that my master’s merits in life were incomplete, hindering their ascent. Thus, I have chosen this [month, day] to solemnly establish at [location] the wondrous fast of the Numinous Treasure Fivefold Refinement of the Corpse for Salvation, lasting two days and nights. May my late master, [name], be supported, guided, and escorted, their form restored and reborn, to roam the great void.

This servant serves the Golden Gates, bound to my master by a bond deeper than father and son. Overwhelmed by grief and sorrow, like a filial son’s heartache, I reverently follow the true teachings and their prescribed order.

I deeply reflect: the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Offices, the luminous statutes of the Four Poles, the Three Ranks of Cavern Laws—resplendent as the sun and moon, their authority like thunder. Those who study the Dao and seek the True easily incur transgressions. Without absolution, they must descend to the dark realms, a path of terror that fills me with dread.

Now, my late master, [name], was born in an auspicious era, wore the mysteries of the Primordial Origin, yet never mastered the methods of cultivating the True and harnessing the light. They merely held the aspiration to aid beings and benefit others. At the festivals of the Primordial and the La, they often violated the precepts; in their scriptural studies and ritual ranks, their morning practices were incomplete. Moreover, in submitting memorials and petitions, they frequently offended the immortals; in establishing fasts and constructing altars, they sometimes displeased the divine officials. Thus, the records of the Dark Bureaus were filled, their qi ledgers inscribed. Their yang transgressions unabsolved, their yin offenses unaddressed, they suddenly departed this world, swiftly consigned to the depths of desolation. Were it not for the vast compassion of the Great Dao, how could this humble disciple swiftly ascend the heights?

With utmost reverence, this humble disciple respectfully presents this memorial of transcendence, submitting it to the Three Heavens. May the Most Sacred, in boundless benevolence, and the Perfected, in profound compassion, deign to bestow the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, descending to envelop the hun-soul, po-soul, and bodily form of my late master [Name]. May his transgressions be erased, his trials and litigations dissolved, and may he ascend directly to the Void, borne upon the light and guided by the qi.

Furthermore, this disciple humbly petitions the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, beseeching all divine bureaus to grant special absolution for the three karmic actions and six sensory afflictions of his past and present lives, as well as the boundless faults committed since embarking upon the Daoist path. May his name be transferred to the Purple Register, and may he be reborn through transformation.

This disciple respectfully invokes the Numinous Treasure Officers of the Destruction of Evil Paths—three灵官 and one hundred twenty officials each; the Officers of the Severance of Earthly Roots—four灵官 and one hundred twenty officials each; and the Officers of the Flight Across the Gates of Karmic Entanglement—five灵官 and one hundred twenty officials each. May they descend as one to eradicate the three evils, sever the earthly roots, and enable the flight across the five karmic gates for my late master [Name]. May his name be inscribed in the Great Mystery, his spirit ascend upon the light, and his soul ascend to the Infinite.

Should the hun-soul and po-soul of my late master [Name] have fallen into the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, the Six Heavens, or the Nine Nether Realms, may they now be delivered and exalted to the highest realms.

Moreover, this disciple respectfully invokes the Twelve Golden Dragon Couriers of the Mysterious Capital, the Nine Dragon Envoys of the Azure Mandate from the Eastern Florescence, one Dao Merit Officer of the Nine Heavens, and ten Flying Celestial Messengers from the Ten Directions—each accompanied by one hundred twenty officials. May they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens to request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, the Golden Register and White Tablet, the Longevity Talisman, the Nine Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace, the True Talisman for Transcending Life and Death, and the Precious Edict of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace. May these be proclaimed to the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Five Emperors and Four Departments, and all the innumerable yin administrations. Should my late master have incurred public or private offenses yet unresolved, may they be absolved through the merit of this transcendent deliverance. Should the karmic entanglements of his three generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or countless kalpas of past relations have bound him in the nether realms, may the merits of his virtuous deeds in life be recorded and swiftly dissolve his transgressions. May his sinful records be altered, his name inscribed upon the Jade Tablet, his spirit elevated in rank, and his soul ascend the celestial thoroughfares.

Furthermore, this disciple invokes the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Nine Heavens, the Five Venerable Lords and all celestial ministries, the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, and all the celestial hosts of the Heavenly Bureaus. May they descend their true qi to receive and guide my late master [Name], cleansing his transgressions and elevating him to the Daoist realms. May he be restored to his office, his qi enter the Mysterious of Mysteries, and his rank be perfected as a true immortal, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth.

This disciple further prays that the true spirits and divine lords of the sacred peak and mountain associated with my late master [Name], along with the Nine Earth Officers of the local territories, each within their respective domains, will safeguard his bodily form. May disasters be averted, his tomb remain undisturbed, his form secure, and his spirit guarded. May his po-soul not wander, and may the talismans and contracts be upheld. May his bones and flesh be revitalized, his form and spirit reunite, and may he roam and ascend freely, attaining the status of a divine immortal, in accordance with the principles of the *Fivefold Refinement of the Living Corpse Sutra*. May he forever uphold the mysterious grace as a testament of devotion.

**Memorial for the Ascension of the Transcendent Soul, the Master’s Companions, and the Departed**

This humble disciple, though unworthy, stands within the ranks of the ordained, presumptuously overseeing the work of salvation. Overwhelmed by undeserved favor, I reflect upon my own limitations, vowing to expand the benevolence of the Cavernous Assistance and subtly aid the virtue of creation and transformation. I humbly beseech the vast generosity of the Most High to look upon my sincere devotion.

In accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a teacher compels me to act, though reason might counsel restraint. I deeply consider that my late master [Name], by virtue of his past karmic connections, was graced with the shelter of the Mysterious, received the registers, upheld the precepts, studied the scriptures, and pursued the truth. Yet, entangled in the dust of the world, he failed to grasp the subtleties of the Dao. In establishing fasts and constructing altars, he often offended the dignity of the rites. In bowing and presenting memorials, he frequently erred in his demeanor. Breaking fasts and violating precepts, he indulged his karmic actions and followed his desires, often disrupting celestial harmony and yielding to human cravings. During the Three Primes and Five La Festivals, he neglected his morning devotions. On the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, he failed to offer repentance and gratitude. His transgressions were inscribed in the Black Registers, his name recorded in the Mysterious Bureaus. Unable to achieve liberation in sitting or standing, to forget the self and ascend through the qi, he met his end in accordance with the workings of destiny. His body passed through the Great Yin, his fate uncertain, and in the blink of an eye, months and years have passed.

This disciple declares: bound by the love of father and child, my heart is overwhelmed with sorrow.
This disciple declares: united by the bond of master and friend, my heart is overwhelmed with sorrow. Were it not for the compassion of the Most Sacred and the protection of the Perfected, who would look upon my ignorance with mercy and grant me this boon? How else could I wash away past transgressions and usher in a new beginning?

Thus, with reckless audacity, this humble disciple respectfully presents this memorial to the Three Heavens. May the Great Compassion, in its perfect completion, and the Perfect Benevolence, boundless in its embrace, deign to issue a sacred decree, commanding the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all relevant domains. May all transgressions of my late master [Name] from the beginningless kalpas to the present life be absolved. May his name be inscribed in the Azure Palace, transferred to the Vermilion Mansion, his form and spirit harmonized, his qi and image perfected. May he follow the merit of my studies, be promoted and rewarded accordingly, restored to his office, and his qi enter the Mysterious of Mysteries. May he become a minister of the Golden Gates in the Court of the Sacred Lord, greatly propagating the sacred transformation, ensuring the unbroken transmission of the Dao. May he attain the status of a divine immortal, roaming freely in the Upper Clarity, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth.

**Memorial for the Severance of Karmic Entanglements and the Stellar Fast of Deliverance**

This humble disciple, dull in nature and ignorant, lacking in talent and virtue, stands within the ranks of the ordained, vowing to extend benevolence through the work of salvation. How could I dare forget to submit petitions on behalf of those who have taken refuge?

In accordance with the intent of this fast, this disciple has observed that the departed soul in question, throughout his life, indulged in karmic actions and followed his desires, heedless of restraint or precepts. After departing this world, his accumulated transgressions and offenses have bound him, leading to his descent and entanglement in the Three Wretched Paths, enduring the Five Sufferings. He remains mired in his attachments, unable to contemplate transcendence. His family, kin, and relatives have all suffered contagion, and his household, young and old, has faced ruin. Seeking a substitute has proven impossible, and thus the cycle of suffering continues unbroken. Such profound entanglement is truly pitiable and grievous. Without the deliverance of the Mysterious Creation, how could this humble one attain peace and security?

Here is the translation:

---

With utmost reverence, this humble one presents a memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that Your boundless compassion may bend in merciful pity. May You deign to send forth the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the depths of the Yellow Springs and dispelling the darkness of the night’s barricades. Thus may the departed, so-and-so, awaken to right mindfulness, repent of past causes, and recognize former errors, seeking ascent of his own accord, sparing further entanglement and forever severing the cycle of recurrence.

This humble one respectfully invokes the presence of the Ten Lords: Shi’an Jun, Du Xing Jun, Zhu Yang Jun, Du Ping Jun, Shuo Ping Jun, Tian Xuan Jun, Shi Xian Jun, Gao Du Jun, Duan* Jun, and Huihua Jun; one Celestial Physician Academician; one Virtuous Discourse Grand Master; and one hundred twenty officials and generals each. Further invoked are: one Chu Yang Jun, one Tian Chang Jun, one Wu Shang Gao Cang Jun, one Zhong Gong Zuo Du Hou Jun, each with ten thousand soldiers; one Lord of the White Chariot and Pale Horse, with one hundred thousand clerks and soldiers; the General of the Three Stars, the Soldier-Star of Venus, the Clerk of Mars, the Iron-Faced Valiant Ghost-Consuming Vanguard, and the armored soldiers and officers of Tian Zou—all to descend as one, admonishing the deceased on behalf of the patron, so-and-so, dissolving tomb disputes, dispelling attachments, and severing the cycle of recurrence.

Additionally, this humble one invokes one Great General to Sever Worms, one Great General to Sever Corpses, each with one hundred thousand officers, generals, and soldiers; one Qi-Supplementing General of the Nine Heavens, one Sweet Dew General, one Life-Protecting General, each with thirty-two officials and generals—to descend as one, safeguarding against future suffering, severing the recurrence of the departed, ensuring the patron’s form and soul enjoy peace and security, the tomb remains undisturbed, and all summons and tomb disputes cease henceforth. May the departed be absolved of sins and ascend to the true, forever transcending the gloom of the netherworld.

May the patron, so-and-so, along with his inner and outer kin, all household and affinal relations, rejoice in carefree bliss, forever freed from contagion, their spirits at ease, their defenses harmonious, blessed with wealth, longevity, health, and tranquility—thus bearing witness to the efficacy of this rite.

Memorial to the Mysterious Vault for the Preemptive Yellow Register Retreat

This unworthy one, undeserving yet entrusted with the mysteries and presuming to lead the true ranks, lifts his gaze in gratitude for the refining grace bestowed, and bows in profound reverence. He aspires to amplify the profound blessings of boundless life and to modestly aid the deep benevolence of transformation. Having diligently submitted his entreaties, how dare he delay in presenting this report?

This humble one, in accordance with the patron’s intent, deeply considers that since the site of the altar’s construction has, since the kalpa’s ashes, been mired in yin turbidity, with wandering miasmas sealing the four directions, dust and haze flowing and lurking, and murk and filth flying—without the power of suspension and purification, how could the reverence for the Mysterious True be made solemn?

Moreover, the residual qi intermingles chaotically, and beings and things flourish in profusion; they must be dissolved and cleansed to attain purity.

With utmost reverence, this humble one presents a memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that Your great compassion may bend to bestow the Mysterious Transformation. May You deign to send forth the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, shining above upon the clouds and heavens, and illuminating below the wind’s ramparts. May the Ten Flowers and Eight Poles be wholly bathed in clarity, so that the constructed retreat altar may be cleansed by the numinous radiance, leaving not a speck of dust, its inner and outer realms fused in purity, where sacred mushrooms spontaneously arise.

This humble one respectfully invokes the Five Emperors of the Five Directions and one Lord of Purification for each direction, each with one hundred twenty officials and generals, bearing the Five Harmonious Fragrant Springs and the True Essence Dharma Water—to descend as one, washing and purifying the numinous altar, dissolving all defilements and impurities.

One thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of Immortal Flowers; the Nine Phoenixes to Break Impurities; and the Great Generals of the Register to Circulate, Dissolve, Gather, Repel, Remove, Sever, Wash, and Scour Impurities, each with one hundred twenty officials and generals; the Five Dragons of the Five Directions and the Water-Mastering Envoys—to descend as one, scouring and cleansing the inner and outer realms, purifying all preparations for the retreat, vessels, implements, chambers, and halls, leaving no trace of filth or residue.

Further, this humble one invokes one Clerk of the Talisman to Descend the True and Summon the Numinous, one Youth to Descend the True and Summon the Numinous, bearing the Highest Jade Clarity Immortal King’s Talisman to Descend the True and the Primordial Sovereign’s Talisman to Summon the Numinous. May they proclaim to the Three Realms, whistle to command the Ten Directions, dispatch a thousand numina, and ally with ten thousand sages, safeguarding the altar’s precepts, rectifying the retreat’s merits from beginning to end, without hindrance or obstruction.

May it further be hoped that Your edict be issued to the Mysterious Altar, the offices of the Numinous Treasure Immortal Bureaus, the provincial and prefectural courts, and all their officers, lords, generals, and clerks—to descend in accordance with this humble one’s invocation, jointly aiding the grand rectification. Thus may the patron, so-and-so, attain perfect good fruits, be secretly enveloped in auspicious omens, receive blessings in this life, and bestow felicity in lives to come. When the altar is dispersed and the merits are proclaimed, may the efficacy of this rite not be in vain.

Memorial for Ascending the Ancestral Mysteries and Dissolving Enmities

This humble one, whose learning is crude and shallow and whose talents are meager and confined, feels deep shame whenever petitioned by others. Yet, relying on the lofty wisdom above and the profound discernment below—

In accordance with the patron’s intent, this humble one, whose duty is to uphold the teachings, finds it difficult to refuse. Thus, beginning on such-and-such a day of this month, he respectfully establishes a Mysterious Altar at such-and-such a place, following the true canons in orderly succession to conduct the rites.

This humble one deeply considers that the patron, so-and-so, has been entangled in worldly debts and deluded by mundane affairs. How could his nine ancestors and seven mysteries be free of karmic burdens? How could his three lives and four debts not have engendered enmities? Without dissolution and transcendence, how could his good merits be made complete?

Thus, on such-and-such a night of such-and-such a month, this humble one first conducts the Great Offering of the Mysterious Capital, presenting pure offerings upon the Jade Mountain, summoning the aforementioned departed soul, universally extending to the six paths and four births, all classes of hidden spirits—to partake of food, undergo refinement, receive precepts, and wear talismans. Whether foe or kin, may all ascend to the realm of purity, so that the patron, so-and-so, may attain bodily purity, all sins be swept away, no tomb disputes arise, and enmities and resentments cease to exist. May he roam freely and at ease, accomplishing good causes.

With utmost reverence, this humble one presents a memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that Your great compassion may bend to bestow the vast transformation. May You deign to send forth the Dao-splendor of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the yin shoulders and enlightening the night’s repositories. May the ten thousand classes of the netherworld equally grasp the mechanism of transformation, riding this numinous radiance to approach the altar’s rites, hear the sutras, and listen to the Dharma, each attaining ascent and transcendence.

*Character not fully legible in original; presumed based on context.

Your humble servant respectfully invokes the thirty-two Great Brahmā Divine Officers of Jade Clarity and the Universal Ferry, along with one hundred transcendent scribes, to bestow upon the patron [Name] the sprinkling of sweet dew, universally transforming the alms-bowl’s feast. May it pervade empty space, boundless and inexhaustible, nourishing all departed spirits, each attaining abundance, responding to karmic resonance to partake, all sated and fulfilled.

Furthermore, your humble servant invokes the thirty-two Divine Officers of Jade Clarity’s Upper Release for Ancestral Liberation and the thirty-two Divine Officers of Karmic Unbinding, each accompanied by one hundred transcendent scribes, to open and absolve the patron [Name]’s ancestral lineages, swiftly erasing the ledgers of transgression. May they forever transcend the snares of attachment, escape the wheel of rebirth, dissolve enmities, and equalize all in compassionate love. May they break free from the prison of grievances, swiftly ascending to the realm of life, that the long-departed may forever be freed from the sorrow of lingering ties, and the patron may attain the fruition of diligent cultivation.

Moreover, your humble servant invokes the Vermilion Fire Bureau of Zhuling, the Upper Palace of Nanchang, the Yellow Register Divine Offices, and the ranks of law-enforcing immortals, each wielding true water and true fire to refine and deliver the multitudes of souls. May they emerge from the gates of darkness, all reborn in the pure realms. Thus may all beings touched by grace awaken from delusion, and those bound by karmic love and enmity alike ascend to the shore of the Dao. May the impartial grace of the Most High be spread abroad, and the creative benevolence of the Mysterious Origin be exalted, reaching from heaven’s edge to earth’s bounds, all receiving the supreme transformation.

**Memorial to Bypass Hell’s Registers**
This humble and ignorant one, having encountered a thousand lifetimes of rare convergence, relies wholly upon the nurturing embrace of the Dao, offering reverent devotion to the august and solemn. Though I measure my worth with trembling awe, I dare to present these words in earnest supplication.

Your humble servant, in accordance with the patron’s intent and the gravity of this sacred duty, finds the principle too weighty to refuse. Thus, beginning on the [Day] of this month, I shall solemnly establish the Mystic Altar at [Location], proceeding in strict accordance with the true rites and canonical sequence.

I reflect with urgency upon the patron [Name], who, though dwelling in the dust-laden world and entangled in the web of mortal existence, has acted for self and others, accumulating transgressions and faults. In scheming for body and family, he has repeatedly incurred karmic obstructions, indulging the three corpses and five burdens, yielding to the three karmas and six senses. The registers of Mount Tai and the ledgers of Beideng await his name; when his hundred years of fate are spent, he must descend into the dark and desolate. When the nine nights’ spirits depart, he will inevitably face judgment. Thus, he now prostrates in sincerity before the Mystic Ultimate, seeking in advance the gracious pardon of the Azure Vault. May his past sins be wholly dissolved, his former errors never repeated. May he avoid the dark and shadowed paths, ever treading in radiant light, ascending directly to the Southern Palace, forever departing the Northern Bureau.

Upon examining his heartfelt devotion, I find it truly pitiable and worthy of compassion.

With utmost reverence, this humble one presents a memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that Your great compassion may bend to bestow the vast transformation. May You deign to issue a sacred mandate, proclaiming it to the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Offices, Six Caverns, Ten Palaces, the registers of Luo and Deng, the hidden springs of the Yellow River’s source, the Five Paths in their entirety, the Examiners of the Five Thearchs, the karmic scribes of the Six Palaces, the mighty Heavenly Enforcers, the divine soldiers who mete out punishment, the officers of life and death, the recorders of deeds, the city gods and earth spirits, the officials who preside over transgressions—may all these be commanded that the patron [Name]’s sins, whether heavy or light, committed since time immemorial and since his birth—whether by thought, word, self, or instruction—be wholly eradicated by this meritorious act. May his black ledgers of wrongdoing be expunged, his name transferred to the azure registers. When his destined time of passing arrives and his body enters the Great Yin, may the mystic offices wherever he dwells universally provide protection, sparing him from suffering and swiftly guiding him to the Southern Heaven. May he receive the transformation of Zhuling, roaming freely and at ease, his wheel of rebirth unbroken, attaining the rank of immortal. May the truth of this petition be manifestly fulfilled as herein declared.

**Memorial for Registration in the Southern Palace**
This rustic and unworthy one, a dull and uncultivated soul, has by error been ranked among the ordained and presumptuously taken up the office of salvation. Having pledged sincerity in earnest supplication, I now humbly request the transmission of this mandate.

Your humble servant, in accordance with the patron’s intent and the sacred duty of this office, finds the principle too weighty to refuse. Thus, beginning on the [Day] of this month, I shall solemnly establish the Mystic Altar at [Location], proceeding in strict accordance with the true rites and canonical sequence.

I reflect upon the patron [Name], whose body dwells in the dust-laden world yet whose heart yearns for the Mystic Pass. Having repented of transgressions and sought grace with utmost sincerity, he now performs this fast and practices the Dao, exhausting his devotion in reverence. He aspires to erase his sins in this life, that in death he may be transferred to the blessings of fortune. May the springs of Beidu and the hidden streams be cleansed of his criminal records; may the Upper Palace of Nanchang inscribe his name in the true register. If on this day his name is recorded with radiance, then in future lives he shall receive transformation without sorrow. His earnest devotion, thoroughly examined, is truly pitiable and worthy of compassion.

With utmost reverence, this humble one presents a memorial to ascend to the Three Heavens, prostrating in hope that Your great compassion may bend to bestow the vast transformation. May You deign to issue a sacred mandate, proclaiming it to the Southern Offices, that his name be erased from the blackened ledgers and immediately inscribed in the registers of Zhuling.

Your humble servant respectfully invokes the Venerable Immortal of the Southern Palace who Delivers from Death, the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Divine Marshal of Salvation, the True Lord Hanjun the Elder who Cherishes Life, the Divine Officers of Life and Destiny of the Southern Offices, the Venerable Immortals who Prolong Life and Extend Years to Deliver from Calamity, and the Boundless True Lord who Resurrects the Dead and Delivers All—may they as one descend in response, specially to record the patron [Name]’s name in the Mystic Register, erasing his sins from the Mount Deng of transgressions. When his hundred years of fate are spent, may he ascend directly to the Vermilion Fire, never passing through the dark realms, ever beholding the sunlit heavens. May his blessings overflow to his descendants, and the grace of heaven pour forth through the vast kalpas.

May Your sagely favor extend to all beings, overseeing the unfolding of good and evil, bathing them in the vastness of this fast’s merit. May all under heaven equally receive abundant blessings; may the six destinies and three paths all partake of pure grace. May the clouds of compassion spread wide, the dew of profound blessing drench all. Whether moving or still, flying or submerged, may all beings live in freedom. May the multitudes of the dark realms be transformed without limit, the divine winds of Great Harmony stirring, the supreme governance of timely harmony resounding.

**Memorial for the Assembly of Perfected to Oversee Salvation**
This humble one, born under the Mystic Mandate in an age of prosperity, is ashamed to have accomplished nothing for the benefit of others, yet aspires to extend the blessings of salvation. I humbly offer this small contribution, daring to beseech repeatedly, hoping that the exalted may deign to heed my plea.

Your humble servant, in accordance with the patron’s intent and the sacred duty of this office, finds the principle too weighty to refuse. Thus, beginning on the [Day] of this month, I shall solemnly establish the Mystic Altar at [Location], proceeding in strict accordance with the true rites and canonical sequence.

This humble servant deeply considers that the patron, [Name], burdened by karmic conditions and bound by the worldly net of livelihood, amidst the five desires and seven emotions, cannot be without transgressions. The six causes and ten habits readily accumulate faults and errors. Though now submerged in the present age, I fear these may entangle him in the life to come. Having confessed sins before the Northern Bureau and registered his name in the Southern Office, he has received the profound grace of the Dao. Yet unless he is initiated in this life to receive salvation, forever severing the threads of evil, how may he accept the precepts and bear the talisman, ever tending toward the realm of goodness?

Thus, I earnestly present this sincere petition, looking up to the boundless benevolence of the vast heavens. I humbly offer a memorial, to be heard by the Three Heavens, beseeching the great compassion to bestow its vast transformation. May a special decree be issued, proclaimed throughout the ten directions and three realms, and entrusted to the Mystic Bureaus, that the patron, [Name], may solemnly establish the altar, array the pledges of alliance, and reverently welcome the myriad sages and summon the thousand perfected. Following the scriptures of the Golden Register for salvation, may he receive the wondrous nine precepts and two tablets. In the years to come, at the time of his passing, may he not fall into the paths of delusion but ascend directly to the Crimson Palace, there to be reborn and receive transformation.

I humbly invoke the Most High Nine Heavens Emperor Lord, the Thirty-Two Heavens Emperor Lords, the Five Spirits and Five Venerable Emperor Lords, the Perfected Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Three Officials Emperor Lords, the Salvation Perfected Assembly of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the celestial bureaus and earthly courts, the Five Marchmounts and Four Seas, and the innumerable true lords. May they deign to descend to the Mystic Altar, oversee the salvation, and bear witness to the initiation. On behalf of the patron, [Name], may they dissolve karmic enmities, deliver ancestral spirits, dispel the sufferings of the hungry ghosts, sever the roots of karmic retribution, erase his name from the registers of the shades, and inscribe it in the true ledgers. May they descend the golden liquid to refine his form, irrigate the spiritual sprout to generate vital essence. May the nine qi circulate throughout, the eight luminaries be complete, the demonic trials of the five phases be dispelled, and the calamities of ten thousand kalpas be averted. May the white tally grant ascent to higher realms, the red writ safeguard his destiny. Rejoicing in his salvation, may he be unbound by the gates of heaven, and in carefree transcendence, forever depart from the portals of earth. When his hundred-year allotment is spent, may he proceed directly to the Southern Cinnabar, receive the scriptures, and ascend beyond, forever attaining the wondrous fruit. May this cultivate the blessings of this life and plant the foundations of prosperity for future existences, merging with the Dao to become true—this as a token of efficacy.

**Amnesty Decree of the Jade Pure Great Amnesty for the Opening of Salvation and the Yellow Register**

*Memorial from the Supreme Mystery Capital to the Wardens of the Nine Dark Realms of Dengdu and the Myriad Underworld Bureaus:*

**Edict from the Chancellery:**
The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is life, its benevolence embracing the Three Realms. The radiance of sun and moon must shine with grace, permeating the nine dark gulfs. All beings share the same primordial endowment of qi. Yet the six dusts and six senses, the yang’s source, are easily drowned in the mechanisms of transformation. Ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths—those in the yin realms are ensnared in the web of karma. Though their dark sins and wretched souls arise from the common people’s delusions and self-inflicted filth, the true compassion of the Mysterious Origin bends in pity.

Now, according to the memorial submitted by the Dharma Master, humbly awaiting the imperial decree on behalf of the intent of the fast: the petition to the Three Heavenly Gates was earnest and impassioned. The decree was granted, and in accordance with the texts of the Golden Register and White Tally, and the rites of the Jade Casket and Luminous Perfection, all in the night’s abyss shall rejoice upon the vernal terrace.

**Let there be a great amnesty for the Three Realms.** Upon the arrival of this amnesty’s grace, all guilty souls in the Nine Dark Realms—*excepting those guilty of the Ten Evils, the Five Heinous Crimes, disloyalty, unfilial conduct, slander of the Great Dao, or destruction of scriptural teachings*—shall be pardoned. All other offenses, whether minor or grave, whether discovered or undiscovered, proven or unproven, suffered or unsuffered, repaid or unrepaid, shall be universally absolved. Those not previously forgiven shall now be released.

**Let the underworld scribes and yin officials** of great merit and profound virtue be promoted to immortal ranks, and in due order, advance to fill vacancies among the yang officials.

**Let the deities of mountains and rivers**, whether listed in the sacrificial canon or not, who have rendered service to the living, all be promoted and rewarded, ensuring just and fitting recognition.

**Let all in the Dao of Heavenly Immortals, the Dao of Divine Spirits, the Dao of Human Relations, the Dao of Hells, the Dao of Hungry Ghosts, and the Dao of Beasts**—whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation—be released from karmic grievances, their past transgressions absolved. May they forever escape the wheel of rebirth and ascend to blissful realms.

**Let those in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**, exiled laborers, imprisoned souls, and the condemned in the offices of Earth and Water, all be pardoned of their crimes. May their names be stricken from the ledgers, their release from the underworld paths granted, and their rebirth in the yang realms assured.

**Let the deceased, [Name],** for whom this rite is performed, along with their nine ancestral lineages and seven generations of kin, and all karmically connected relatives through the ages, have their enmities dissolved, their sins erased, their ranks certified, and their transcendence achieved, to be reborn anew.

**Let those in the world** who perished by fire or flood, by blade or treachery, by bandits or beasts, by royal execution or lightning’s strike, by falling trees or crushing stones, by wounds from weapons, by chronic hunger or cold, by poison or sorcery, by overturned carts or plunging steeds, by hanging or drowning, by exile or military demise, by ghostly bonds or vengeful ties, by illness or sudden death, by miscarriage or birth trauma, by blindness, deafness, lameness, or muteness, by paralysis or deformity—all who have languished in the dark realms, unliberated—have their karmic debts dissolved, their new transgressions cleansed, their suffering cycles ended, and their rebirth in the good realms secured.

**Let those bound by enmity across three lives and seven generations**, whose grievances remain unresolved, be united in compassion, their entanglements released. May each attain transcendence and their ancient resentments vanish.

**Let those imprisoned in the Iron Enclosure, the Uninterrupted Hell, the Gorge of Blood, or the Lake of Childbirth** have their karmic filth washed away, their hatreds reconciled, their forms and spirits purified, and their rebirth in joyful realms achieved.

**Let all wandering souls and stagnant spirits** on the dark roads of the underworld—whether claimed or unclaimed, whether meeting violent or peaceful ends, whether scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, civil or military officials, physicians or diviners, men or women, old or young, commoners or nobles, Chinese or foreign, from the Nine Provinces or the Four Seas—who have long drowned in suffering, with no means of escape, have their crimes absolved, their enmities dissolved, and their rebirth according to their wishes, free and at ease.

**Let all matters not fully enumerated in this amnesty decree** be recorded by local officials and memorialized for consideration.

**Alas!**
Erase the ledgers of sin, uproot the roots of evil—so vast is the celestial grace like a spring’s overflow.
Depart the ghostly offices, exit the earthly gates—so true is the mercy of transcendence and salvation.

Rejoicing with all living beings, may they together return to the perfect transformation.

**Upon the arrival of this amnesty decree, the wardens shall implement it without delay.** The memorial is respectfully submitted to the Supreme Emperor. Let copies be made swiftly and distributed to all subordinate offices, to be reverently obeyed in accordance with the imperial edict. Let there be no delay, as wind and fire.

To the right: The Great Amnesty of the Jade Pure Realm, ordinarily unused, is employed only at the Yellow Register Altar. It is inscribed on several sheets of large paper, with the preceding text written in large characters. The edicts to the "Gate of Decrees" and the "Three Heavens’ Gate of Decrees" are to be written with care—never hastily brushed, but held in restraint until the Dharma Master has copied the amnesty’s duplicate and memorialized the Three Heavens’ Gate of Decrees and the Three Ministries, dispatching spirit-messengers to ascend the Golden Gates of the Celestial Court. There, they shall urgently present the memorial and await the imperial rescript before returning. Only then shall the Dharma Master, using a vermilion brush, personally fill in the "Gate of Decrees," employing this "edict" character with a large "leak" radical. On the front, he shall inscribe: *"The Dharma Master [Rank] [Name], bearing the decree and executing the mandate."* On the reverse, he shall write in large characters: *"Memorial of the Supreme Mystery Capital to the Wardens of the Nine Dark Realms and the Myriad Underworld Offices."* It shall be dispatched together with the Salvation Talisman.

The Precious Amnesty of the Azure Mystery is used for the Azure Mystery Yellow Register and the Yellow Register of the Left Bureau of the Azure Mystery. It is memorialized to the Wardens of the Nine Dark Realms and the Myriad Underworld Offices.

The Decree to the Gate of Decrees and the Office of Verification:

As the constant revolutions of Heaven and Earth know no end, and the transformative mechanisms of yin and yang never cease, we gaze upon the ghostly domains of Luo and Deng, the desolate and forsaken spirit-realms. The benighted and foolish below ever receive the threads of evil and repay them in kind, while the lofty and sagely above ever pity the nature of goodness and uplift it. Thus, we exalt the grace of the Nine Radiant Rain and Dew, still the thunderous trials of the Six Caverns, and widely proclaim virtue and beneficence, universally turning the Wheel of Compassion. May all depart the dark prisons and equally enter the realms of light.

Now, in accordance with the memorial submitted by the Dharma Master bearing the decree for the fast, we await the imperial rescript. Memorializing the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor, it is fitting to issue the Phoenix Edict and display the Dragon Talismans, opening the Nine Earths to freedom and rescuing the multitudes of spirits to joy. Let there be a general amnesty across the Three Realms. Upon the arrival of this amnesty’s grace, all sinners in the Nine Dark Realms—save those guilty of the Ten Evils, Five Heinous Crimes, disloyalty, unfiliality, slandering the Great Dao, or destroying scriptures and teachings—shall be pardoned. All other offenses, whether minor or grave, whether discovered or undiscovered, proven or unproven, suffered or unsuffered, repaid or unrepaid, shall be universally absolved.

For the spirits of mountains, forests, and altars who are perceptive, upright, and whose merits extend to the people, local officials shall record their deeds and memorialize them for reward and promotion.

To all wardens of the Northern Deng and Eastern Tai, and the water and earth offices: all imprisoned and interrogated sinful souls shall have their names expunged from the registers of sin, their grievance-documents burned, their suffering ended, and their transcendence to the Yang Realm achieved.

To all those in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, exiled laborers, and prisoners of the Eight Difficulties and Dark Passes, bound by accumulated grievances: let their transgressions be absolved, their enmities dissolved, and their rebirths in the human or celestial realms granted according to their merits.

For all the deceased delivered by the Mysterious Altar, [Name] and [Clan], along with their Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations, and all karmic relations through countless kalpas: let their transgressions be erased, their enmities resolved, their ascents and promotions secured, and their rebirths in blissful realms achieved.

For all lost souls in the dark passes and desolate paths, stubbornly sunk in delusion and unable to attain liberation: let their true natures be guided, their good hearts awakened, and their rebirths facilitated without self-attachment.

For all who died by misfortune, not of natural causes, and have fallen into the dark paths—truly pitiable—let their enmities be dissolved, their sins erased, their bodies and minds purified, and their swift rebirths secured.

For all who, in life, possessed even the slightest goodness yet have languished in eternal night, their time in darkness long: let their merits be examined, their names recorded, and their cases memorialized to the Azure Bureau for appointment and service.

For all souls imprisoned in the Blood Lake Hell due to childbirth: let their grievances be severed, their enmities resolved, their forms purified, and their rebirths granted according to their merits.

For all within the Nine Provinces and Ten Regions, Chinese and foreign, those who met violent or natural ends, with or without descendants, men and women, old and young, scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—innumerable multitudes long confined in the dark passes: let their enmities and affections be harmonized, their sins erased, their universal deliverance achieved, and their ascents and promotions secured at every moment.

For all matters not fully enumerated in this amnesty, local officials shall memorialize them accordingly.

Alas! Freed from the sorrows of confinement and coercion, may all beings transcend the Northern Bureau; blessed with escort and welcome, may their forms and souls ascend directly to the Southern Palace. Rejoicing with the myriad multitudes, may they together return to the perfect transformation.

Upon the arrival of this amnesty decree, the wardens shall implement it without delay. Memorializing the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor, let copies be made swiftly and distributed to all subordinate offices, to be reverently obeyed in accordance with the imperial edict. Let there be no delay, as wind and fire.

Memorial of the Supreme Mystery Capital to the Wardens of the Nine Dark Realms and the Myriad Underworld Offices.

Decree to the Gate of Decrees:

Heaven bestows and Earth generates, we look up to the great creation of Qian and Kun; yang closes and yin opens, in accord with the constant alternation of day and night. Thus, while the Black Register Office interrogates and investigates, the Purple Ultimate abundantly extends mercy and forgiveness. We speak of the Six Destinies, none more pitiable than the Nine Dark Realms. Long nights of delusion entangle the mechanisms of karma in the abyssal depths; the mists of the Yellow Springs enclose the nets of grievance. Though they may harbor repentant hearts, who shall guide their nature to seek life? In silent contemplation of their plight, we find them truly pitiable.

Now, in accordance with the memorial submitted by the Dharma Master bearing the decree for the fast, we await the imperial rescript. Memorializing the Supreme Emperor, we humbly present the words of the memorial, fully expressing our earnest devotion.

With utmost reverence, we contemplate the august title of the Jade Emperor Supreme Sovereign—this name transcends all names, supreme beyond all supremacy. Those who hear it find ten thousand sins dissolved; those who attain it see a thousand grievances unraveled. His benevolence permeates the cosmos, his deeds recorded in sacred annals. With each proclamation of amnesty, it is as though the Emperor himself descends in person.

Let us now broadly proclaim his virtuous decree and resplendently unfold his precious edict, that all who suffer in the lower destinies may equally attain the blissful realms.

By imperial command, a great amnesty shall be granted throughout the Three Realms. All souls in the Nine Dark Realms who committed offenses prior to the establishment of the altar on the appointed day of this month—*excepting* those guilty of the Ten Heinous Crimes, the Five Treacheries, disloyalty, unfilial conduct, slander of the Great Dao, or destruction of scriptural teachings—shall be pardoned. All other transgressions, whether discovered or undiscovered, adjudicated or unadjudicated, endured in suffering or yet to be endured, punished or yet to be punished, regardless of severity, shall be absolved without exception.

For all mountain and river deities who have rendered meritorious service to the people, local magistrates shall compile and submit reports of their deeds for promotion and reward.

For all underworld officials and yin ministers who have not imposed excessive punishments nor bestowed undue rewards, they shall be elevated to celestial ranks and, in due order, appointed to fill vacancies among the yang officials.

For all beings confined in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, or exiled and enslaved in the Earth and Water Bureaus, their fetters shall be struck off, their past offenses erased, their enmities resolved, and their bonds severed. They shall depart the dark paths and be reborn in realms of bliss.

For all beings of the Six Destinies and Four Births, endlessly bound in karmic retribution, their transgressions shall be forgiven, their grievances reconciled, that they may escape the wheel of rebirth and ascend to the realms of goodness.

For all the departed souls delivered by the Mysterious Altar—[here insert names]—and for their Nine Ancestral Generations and Seven Lineages, along with all karmically connected kin through countless kalpas, their past resentments shall be dissolved, their evil roots extirpated. They shall receive transformation, transcend this life, and abide in carefree bliss.

For all those who met untimely deaths, whose souls and spirits languish in the nether realms, their transgressions shall be erased, their grievances released. According to their merit, they shall be reborn, spared the darkness of the wheel.

For all souls in the Blood Pool Hell, their offenses shall be cleansed, their enmities purged, mother and child reunited, body and spirit transcendent.

For all wandering souls who have received offerings and deliverance from descendants but have yet to ascend, they shall be guided forthwith. All merits accrued from past rites, great or small, shall ensure their ascent, that none remain trapped in the yin realms.

For all the myriad souls of the Nine Provinces and Ten Regions—soldiers and civilians, scholars and farmers, artisans and merchants, men and women, old and young, with or without descendants, whether they met violent or peaceful ends—all who have long languished in the dark realms without deliverance shall have their grievances washed away, their transgressions dispersed. Swiftly shall they be turned on the wheel of rebirth to be born in joyous realms.

For any matters not fully enumerated in this amnesty, local magistrates shall compile and submit detailed reports.

Alas! Even those in dire pain cry out to Heaven, hoping for relief from their burdens. How much more, then, should those who fast and serve the Emperor expect their faults to be cleansed? Now, with the imperial edict so thoroughly proclaimed and the precious decree so radiantly manifest, let the Ten Flowers extol its praise, let the Three Realms bow in reverence. May the spring of deliverance return to the dark paths, may the dawn break in the frozen courts. Below, let the gates of death be sealed; above, let the gates of life swing wide. All you who hold office in these realms, take heed and comply.

Upon receipt of this amnesty, the responsible officials shall implement it without delay. The edict is hereby transmitted by imperial command for copying and distribution to all subordinate offices, to be observed in accordance with the Emperor’s decree. Let it be executed with the swiftness of wind and fire.

Thus the memorial is concluded.
