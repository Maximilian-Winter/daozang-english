**The Register of the Three Venerables of the Supreme Nine Heavens’ Celestial Elder**

The Perfected One states: All scriptures—*Supreme Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, *Three Sovereigns*, *Five Marchmounts*, and the *Five Thousand Character Writ*—are cultivated and revered in accordance with these Three Venerables. This is the initial dharma-gate of Golden Clarity’s response. All heavenly beings of the ten directions who follow my master’s Golden Clarity in this dharma shall share with me the same radiance in the Jade Realm. From this point, you may transcribe the divine charts and registers of the Perfected. Do not transcribe them prematurely, lest you incur fault.

**First Transmission Master:** The Lord of the Upper Mystery and True Clarity of the Dao, who is the Celestial Elder of the Primordial August Thearch.
**Dharma Surname:** . The Perfected One states: This is the correct sound for "Wu" (Non-Being).
**Dharma Name:** . The Perfected One states: This is the correct sound for "Yanshiyin" (Prolonging the World’s Sound).
**Dharma Style:** . The Perfected One states: This is the correct sound for "Guanwuguan" (Contemplating Non-Contemplation).

His form stands eighteen feet tall, with a golden countenance and a body suffused with the seven treasures. His neck is adorned with a five-colored halo of radiant light. He wears a luminous crown of flowing essence-jade, robes of ninefold splendor and soaring ridges, and a natural, seamless divine cloak of streaming light and cloud-brightness. His belt is strung with sun-and-moon pearls, and his sash is set with luminous, thunder-flame, fiery radiance-jade. Above him floats a canopy of seven treasures and flying jasper blossoms. His feet tread upon the Three Heavens of Bright Empyrean, and he sits upon a throne of five-colored lions. Thirty thousand jade lads and jade maidens stand to his left and right, before and behind. The Perfected One constantly burns incense and scatters blossoms, attending before the Dao.

On all four sides, the hosts of the True Origin’s yoke are arrayed, all clad in garments of flying celestial brilliance, seated together upon thrones of spontaneous numinous flowers.

The true luminous form of the Dao Lord constantly abides in the Golden Resemblance Palace of the Supreme Clarity’s Upper Realm, within the True Hamlet of the Eightfold Clarity Precinct of the Jasper Heavenly Prefecture.

The Perfected One states: When the heaven-dwellers of the ten directions receive the Dao, they must visualize my master in this complete form. Thus, the uppermost reaches will be penetrated, and divine radiance will descend to illuminate your body, signaling the advent of the Perfected. Then, with your heart, bow three times in reverence.

After visualizing the Perfected, vow in your heart and pray, saying:

May the Boundless Supreme Mysterious True Primordial Heavenly Worthy descend in a feathered luminous flying chariot to deliver me through all past lives, the living and the dead, universally liberating all from the ten sufferings and eight adversities, ascending to the supreme blissful halls of the ten directions’ flying heavens, there to receive joy and delight, roaming freely within the Seven Treasures Grove. May the world below universally receive deliverance, and may all karmic entanglements and delusions be dissolved without exception. On the day I attain the Dao, I shall ascend into the formless.

The second master to be visualized is the Primordial Supreme Mysterious Elder, who is none other than the Highest Nine Heavens’ Supreme Perfected King. His dharma surname is *Guang* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Void and Nothingness”). His dharma name is *Gui* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Upward Contemplation of the Ancestral Temple”). His dharma courtesy name is *Ling* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Moving the Brahma Spirit”). His form stands eighteen feet tall, his body radiant with golden light and jeweled splendor, his frame suffused with crimson solar brilliance. Around his neck rests a nine-colored halo, and upon his head he wears a crown of flowing golden blossoms and luminous jade. He is clad in a three-colored flying brocade robe, draped with a cloud-bright phoenix-patterned, seamless, spontaneously arisen jeweled mantle. His belt is adorned with morning-light solar bells and twin pearls of bright moonlight. At his waist hangs a divine golden luminous jade sash. Above him floats a seven-jeweled canopy of flying clouds. His feet tread upon the nine heavens’ radiant rosy clouds, and he is seated upon a nine-colored lion throne. To his left and right, before and behind, stand thirty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. The Perfected One constantly burns hundred-fold blended incense and scatters five-colored cloud-like flowers, attending before the Dao. On all four sides, the hosts of the True Origin’s yoke are arrayed, all clad in flying celestial seven-jeweled garments, seated together upon thrones of spontaneous seven-colored lotus flowers.

The true luminous form of the Dao Lord constantly abides in the Supreme Clarity’s Golden Orchid Palace within the Grand Ultimate Prefecture’s Open Bright Hamlet of the Communing-with-Truth Precinct. The Perfected One states: When you have fully visualized your master in this form, divine radiance will descend to illuminate your body. Then, with your heart, bow three times in reverence.

After visualizing the Perfected, vow in your heart and pray, saying:
May the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Highest open the boundless Dharma vehicle of great compassion to succor the ten directions’ heavens and earth, bringing peace to emperors and kings, ensuring the eternal prosperity of their realms, and bestowing blessings upon all ministers and the countless multitudes. May this extend to me through all past lives, the living and the dead, ascending through the nine heavens to the Mysterious Capital before the Boundless Dao. May all enmity and kinship be equalized, and may all karmic retributions be dissolved without exception. On the day we attain the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless.

The third master to be visualized is the Perfected One’s present master of response and deliverance, who is the Golden Luminous Seven Perfected Ones. His dharma surname is *Yuan* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Mysterious and Wondrous Void”). His dharma name is *Jian* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Prolonging Life and Illuminating”). His dharma courtesy name is *Xi* (the Perfected One states: this is the correct pronunciation for “Connected to the Supreme Void”). His form stands eighteen feet tall, his body radiant with a golden countenance and jeweled splendor, equally resplendent in all ten directions. Around his neck rests a seven-jeweled halo, and upon his head he wears a crown of golden light and flying essence, ever-changing jade. He is clad in a flowing-light, spontaneously arisen cloud-brocade robe, draped with a frost-pearl, naturally luminous great-light jeweled mantle. His belt is adorned with sun-and-moon luminous bells, and at his waist hangs a flowing-gold, flying-lightning jade sash. Above him floats a nine-colored luminous jeweled canopy. His feet tread upon the jade perfected nine heavens’ flying rosy clouds and triple blossoms. He is seated upon a brocade-cloud dragon-mist throne. To his left and right, before and behind, stand thirty thousand jade lads and jade maidens. The Perfected One constantly burns hundred-fold blended reverse-born numinous incense and scatters nine-colored cloud-like flowers, attending before the Dao. On all four sides, the hosts of the ten directions’ utmost Perfected are arrayed, all clad in flying celestial garments, seated together upon thrones of spontaneous reverse-born numinous flowers.

The true luminous form of the Golden Luminous One constantly abides in the Supreme Clarity’s Jade Perfected Highest Nine Heavens’ Golden Resemblance Cavernous Luminous Jade Land’s Cinnabar Spirit Upper Palace, within the Open Clarity Divine Prefecture’s Nine Perfected Hamlet of the Upper Radiance Golden Wheel Precinct. The Perfected One states: This is the master of response in the present world, the teacher who transforms heaven-dwellers and humans through the Dharma. When you have fully visualized your master in this form, divine radiance will descend to illuminate your body. Then, with your heart, bow three times in reverence.

After visualizing the Perfected, vow in your heart and pray, saying:
May the Three Worthies deliver all my past lives’ myriad ancestors, ascending forever to the blessed realms, their forms receiving luminous manifestations, enduring through kalpas without end. May all reclusive mountain-dwelling fellow practitioners of the Dao attain the true Dao, and may cloud chariots and green canopies swiftly descend. On the day I attain the Dao, I shall ascend into the formless.

**Preface to the Golden Luminous Mysterious Response Chapter**
The Void-and-Nothingness Perfected One states: My master, the Golden Luminous One, once responded to the era of Red Clarity. At that time, together with the Highest Nine Heavens’ Supreme August Primordial Sovereign (the Perfected One states: This title refers to the Nine Heavens’ Jade Void Perfected King Dao Lord, who governs from the Nine Heavens’ Luminous Perfected Terrace) and the Nine Heavens’ Supreme August Elder Lord (the Perfected One states: This is the Highest Jade Void Supreme Elder Lord, also known as the Highest Jade Emperor or the Cavernous Perfected Emperor Unity Sovereign, who governs from the Supreme Clarity’s Nine Empyreans Terrace), they all rode chariots of sun-and-moon jade wheels, roaming above the Grand Origin’s luminous empyrean and vast celestial river, gazing beyond the Eight Vastnesses, and surveying the transformations of the Nine Origins. Returning, they ascended to the Cavernous Penglai’s Vast Communicating Brahma Heaven (the Perfected One states: This heaven is the proper name of the Jade Void’s Southern Culmen Flying Heaven’s Upper Nine Vermilion Heavens, the governing abode of the Jade Clarity’s Winged Solar Void Sovereign Great Dao Lord), the Golden Luminous Jade Land (the Perfected One states: This is the general designation for a domain among the heavens), the sole realm roamed by the Eight Poles’ Void Emperor. Within it stands the Three Lights’ Flowing Luminous Golden Dawn Jeweled Palace, encased in thirty thousand layers of spontaneous jade inscriptions. The palace’s four sides are entirely bathed in flying dawn’s jade radiance, illuminating all with brilliance. This palace is also called the abode of the Void Sovereign Lord, and it is the dwelling place of the Jade Perfected Golden Immortals. There is also the Cavernous Luminous Jade Terrace (the Perfected One states: This terrace is the name of the Jade Void’s Southern Upper Vermilion Mound Terrace, towering ten thousand *ren* high, its interior filled with flowing essence, jeweled splendor, and mysterious radiance, as well as luminous pearls and jade light).

Standing in serene stillness, this is the Numinous Terrace. The terrace naturally radiates luminous brilliance, penetratingly void and resplendent, illuminating the Southern Primordial Measureless Heavens. It is also the dwelling place of the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Upper Clarity’s Radiant Uppermost.

Within the Numinous Capital Grotto:
The Perfected One states: The Numinous Capital is the Upper Capital of the Primordial Void Sovereign Great Dao Lord of the Vermilion Heaven. Within it lies the Three Primordials Grotto-Heaven—its upper grotto the realm of Great Stillness, its lower passage extending into boundless domains, and at its center, the Three Primordials’ Primordial Qi Elder presides. The grotto-heaven is filled with spontaneously flowing luminous jade essence, vermilion auroras and phoenix hues, the radiance of sun and moon, and the soaring dawn’s mist, ever blazing within the Three Primordials, resembling the grandeur of flowing fire. Here, the Primordial Unity first refined the Great Existence’s true scriptures, and to this day, this most wondrous numinous treasury remains. Thus, it is called the Grotto.

Those perfected beings who ascend must first arrive at the Southern Vermilion Grotto-Heaven to refine their bodily *qi* and residual impurities, receive luminous visages, polish their golden countenances, and adorn themselves with jeweled splendor. Once their wondrous forms are complete, their bodies become as radiant as the vermilion sun. Only then may they ride the void and mount the floating clouds, ascending to the realm of Wondrous Stillness. Their luminous presence and majestic brilliance then illumine the ten directions, resplendent and boundless. Here, they attain eternal existence, their journey fulfilled.

In the first year of the Primordial Origin Era, in the *jiawu* year, on the first day of the first month at noon, together with the Three Venerable Ones of the Great Primordial Light, they received the *True Writ of the Five Elders’ Vermilion Script of the Primordial Origin of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.
The Perfected One states: This era and its celestial signs belong to the Vermilion Clarity Kalpa. The Three Venerable Ones of the Great Primordial Light are the Primordial Highest Void Sovereign Primordial Origin. By the first year of the Supreme August Era, five kalpas had already passed. At that time, the Three Venerable Ones descended to receive the scripture, ascending the Jeweled Luminous Jade Altar.
The Perfected One states: The Jeweled Altar stands at the center of the Vermilion Heaven, where spontaneously flowing golden jade essence and the radiant splendor of sun and moon congeal into true treasure. The altar has nine tiers, corresponding to the nine heavens. It rises nine thousand *ren* high, its brilliance illuminating the ten directions. It is here that the Golden Clarity ascends, and the Mysterious Response receives the affairs of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. The Nine Heavens’ Perfected Sovereigns, the Supreme Three Heavens’ Perfected Kings, and the Five Elders of the Primordial Origin oversee the covenant, with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water as witnesses.

The Sole True Admiration:
The Perfected One states: The Sole True Admiration refers to the wondrous transformations of the Mysterious Sages in response, the flourishing of the Great Vehicle’s guidance, universally bestowing boundless grace, pervading the six paths, embodying great compassion and great mercy, broadly aiding the ten directions. The Dharma treasury is pure and void, unstained by worldly desires, as immaculate as a wondrous mirror. It is not a matter of mere companionship but a vow to uphold the Dharma’s pinnacle brilliance, illuminating the four images in serene stillness, beyond the reach of ordinary principles or the grasp of benevolence and wisdom.

The Ten Directions All Illumined:
The Perfected One states: At that time, the ten directions’ heavens and earth all responded with auspicious signs—seven treasures rained down, and the celestial beings of the ten directions received blessings. The hidden and manifest realms rejoiced together for over nine thousand years, during which the sun and moon paused in their course.

The Nine Heavens Jointly Witness:
The Perfected One states: This refers to the Perfected Sovereigns and Perfected Kings bearing witness at that time. It pertains to those who harmonize with the true.

The Perfected One states: This speaks of the alignment of destiny yet to unfold, thus selecting those whose Dharma nature accords with the Way. Without a body of golden bones and jade treasuries, one cannot receive it. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the imperial registers and mysterious charts, it cannot be transmitted.

Liberating the Boundless, Eternally Filling the Ten Directions’ Bridge of Blessings:
The Perfected One states: Without the Nine Heavens’ scriptural movements, the Numinous Treasure would descend to teach and save the world at the end of the final kalpa. Thus, it universally aids the ten directions, delivering all from the disasters of water and fire, liberating the boundless. It does not discriminate between good and evil—those who take refuge in the Dharma Vehicle are all delivered to the shore of blessings, preserving the seed of humanity for the future. Without the merit of the Numinous Treasure, how could this be achieved? Truly, in this worthy kalpa, the Numinous Treasure descends to teach, while false paths and spurious doctrines all vanish, leaving only this Dharma to flourish. Thus, it is known that the boundless liberation of beings universally benefits all lives.

Therefore, the compassionate Dharma enriches the ten directions, ever abiding in a heart of great mercy, moistening the three realms, broadly benefiting without hindrance, illuminating all beings with wisdom, and accomplishing all Dharma practices of heavenly and human realms. It stabilizes the mind and embraces stillness, guiding all to cultivate the joy of stillness, sever the karma of ignorance, and return to emptiness in every thought. Thus, it reveals the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures’ wondrous teachings, encompassing the myriad conditions of emptiness and existence, manifesting the entanglements of afflictions and delusions, and demonstrating the suffering of beings whose karmic retributions remain unsevered and unexhausted—the fundamental karma of life and death. Therefore, it opens the gate of wondrous goodness and great practices, enabling all beings to rightly perceive the undifferentiated nature of sin and blessing, to uphold the Ten Precepts, to take refuge in the Ten Goodnesses as the supreme power of the Twelve Attainments, and to follow the luminous precepts to gather in the deluded masses, awakening them to the sublime realm of Great Stillness. It guides them to the three paths of suffering, where even enemies and kin are treated equally. Without the merit of the Numinous Treasure, how could this be achieved?

The Void Perfected One states: The true Dharma is the right awakening responding to the right teaching, awakening the deluded masses to the right path. Its wondrous principle is profoundly mysterious, truly beyond the discourse of benevolence and wisdom—how dare one presume to grasp it with body and mind? Moreover, the Three Venerable Ones’ responses pervade the kalpas without omission. Their manifestations follow the kalpas, appearing or abiding as wondrous transformations require. Without such responses, who would fulfill this role? Thus, the marvelous subtlety of the divine reaches even the wisdom of sages, for it is the numinous proximity of the Jade Heaven, revealing the profound source of the Great Dao. The Dharma nature is profoundly subtle, transcending the Nine Clarities, comprehending the myriad paths in the unbegun heavens, and responding accordingly. Its merit shines with the vermilion radiance of the four images, dispelling darkness in primordial chaos. The two principles follow it to attain order. Thereupon, the numinous charts blaze with wondrous brilliance in eight gatherings, responding within the Great Vastness. Thus, all directions awaken to this truth.

But when the profound obscurity is at last dispelled and universal slumber gives way to awakening, it is through these very words that principle is expounded. Yet there are founding sages of the teachings whose emergence, like the rising of dawn’s rosy clouds, may be called the masters of transformation. They respond to all that is felt, uniquely unhindered by the myriad things, thus drawing upon the power of wisdom to follow the work of transformation. This is what is meant by the Dao as the most exalted and wondrous of all that is subtle and transformative—so wondrous that it transcends all designation as the sovereign of the Great Treasury. If one points to its source and direction, its depth and vastness are beyond compare, for they cannot be measured by words or images. The empty mind, boundless and distant, is not a matter for discussion among the Three Realms. Its merit surpasses the origins of all reckoning, for it truly stands within the realm where mind and perception are utterly transcended.

From this arises non-action, nameless yet accomplishing all; the emptiness of non-emptiness, formless yet manifesting all forms. Thus, the myriad dharmas gather without exception, and no image fails to respond. It is not the great stillness of mere quiescence, for no numinous presence fails to respond. Without ancestor or lineage, empty yet not empty, it is the response of emptiness itself. Pervading the ten directions in the vastness of the formless, it extends through the boundless void. All matters are entrusted to it, and nothing is beyond its charge. Converging in a single direction, it governs the salvation of all beings, vast beyond the myriad forms, standing alone beyond the ten thousand mechanisms. For kalpas uncounted and blessings innumerable, it remains the tranquil realm where the highest perfected ones lodge their spirits.

The boundless subtlety of the Great Dao transcends all form and speech—how then could its wondrous realm be discussed? Yet the multitude of beings have slumbered for ages untold. Without response, there is no awakening; without transformation, no enlightenment. Thus, our master, the Golden Radiance, descended from the divine heavens to safeguard this kalpic convergence, rectifying the Dao and bestowing its teachings below. His advent was like the first glow of morning’s lamp or the initial reflection in the wondrous mirror of the Jade Perfected. Thereby, the numinous perfected ones attain wondrous awakening, illuminating the ten directions and suffusing the Three Realms with light. The Six Paths are opened to prosperity, the teachings spread through the heavens, and the glory of the host of sages shines forth. This is not merely the eternal treasure of the wondrous vow but also the eternal mother of the myriad dharmas. Thus, the苦海 is forever crossed in the final kalpa, and when the beings of that age wholeheartedly take refuge, their blessings arise at once.

This is the simultaneous illumination of the Six Perfections, the Four Immeasurables, and the Three Clarities, shining upon all directions, all attaining divine wisdom, penetrating both the hidden and the manifest without obstruction. The flourishing of the Three Treasures reaches its zenith here. Now, the Golden Standard and Golden Radiance who received this charge are none other than the responsive emanations of the Vermilion Radiance. Yet if one seeks its wondrous essence, there is ultimately no duality. Truly, it is the natural state of spontaneity—what need is there for teacher or companion in oneself? In returning, it is one; in responding, it is manifold. It is not by my own wisdom that the profound mystery of the primal source can be fathomed.

Having been commanded by the Golden Radiance to examine the register of the Three Honored Ones, how dare I presume to annotate it with the limited vision of a pipe’s glance? Thus, I record this to show future generations and like-minded disciples.

The Golden Venerable of the Heavenly Treasure and Jade Emperor declared: At that time, the Supreme Vacuous Jade Heaven’s Highest Ancestor, the Vacuous Sovereign of the Dao, the Supreme Jade Clarity Vacuous Non-Being Perfected One, and the Supreme Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder—

The Golden Perfected said: These Three Perfected Ones are all disciples of the Golden Radiance’s *Wondrous Scripture of Entering Quiescence through the Profound*. Each was dispatched by the Golden Radiance to compile the register of the Three Honored Ones’ jade transmissions, completing the wondrous work of the *Golden Chapters of the Upper Scripture* in one scroll, which was then presented before the Original Heavenly Honored One. At that time, the Heavenly Honored One entrusted it to the Three Treasures’ Jade Emperor for safekeeping, to be stored in the Great Vacuous Jade Heaven’s Heavenly Treasure Purple Radiance Golden Splendor Flowing Brilliance Great Light Treasure Sovereign’s Upper Palace. There, thirty-six Jade Lads of the Golden Dawn from each of the ten directions of the Jade Heaven perpetually burn the naturally fragrant Hundred Harmonies Reborn Incense, scattering five-colored flowing clouds and hundred-jeweled blossoms to attend and guard the register-scripture of the Three Honored Ones.

When perfected beings of the ten directions who cultivate the supreme Dao encounter a propitious kalpa and obtain the register-scripture of the Three Honored Ones, they shall treasure and record it alongside the Three Treasures. This is the true practice of the highest and most wondrous perfected ones.

The Golden Perfected said: Those who uphold this jade scripture should place it together with the wondrous scriptures of the Three Caverns, offering reverence, veneration, and daily worship. Let it never be treated with negligence, disrespect, or defilement toward the Three Honored Ones. The Jade Lads who attend the scripture will report your transgressions to the Heavenly Treasure, and the Wind Blades will instantly arise upon your body.

The Golden Radiance said: When heavenly and human beings attain my Dao, they may, according to the sequence and hierarchy of their practice, transcribe the register-scripture of the Three Honored Ones they are destined to receive. The scripture should be encased in a brocade bag and kept with the scriptures of the Three Caverns for veneration. If there is no place to venerate the Three Caverns’ scriptures, it may be placed in a separate chamber, treated with the same reverence as the Three Caverns’ scriptures. Morning and evening, burn incense and perform prostrations. At such times of cultivation and respect, never depart from the precepts, and maintain constant worship without a moment’s lapse. The Three Honored Ones’ Dao-eye will long perceive you with profound insight, and your heart will resonate with the ten directions, penetrating the perfected, communicating with the wondrous and quiescent, summoning flying immortals, ascending to the Jade Realms, entering the formless, attaining eternal existence, and embodying the golden numen. Thereupon, the Jade Lads will attend you, and the Dao’s perfection will be achieved.

The Golden Perfected said: Those who reverently uphold this jade scripture will have the great sages, heavenly deities, and officials of the Three Realms from all ten directions come to guard their gates and halls, perpetually worshipping its text. The Heavenly Perfected will descend three times each month to pay homage to the register of the Three Honored Ones. Moreover, ghosts and spirits will guard it, and heavenly beings will attend—how could one fail to revere and uphold it?

The Golden Radiance said: The Three Honored Ones are the Three Treasures. The supreme wondrousness of the Dao is boundlessly exalted, without limit or measure, without height or depth—truly, it is the boundless. Be cautious, most cautious. I now earnestly reiterate this warning to ensure your attainment of perfection. Without the mysterious responses of the Three Honored Ones, who would ferry you across the great quiescence of emptiness?

The Golden Perfected said: This scripture of the Golden Radiance has, since kalpas immeasurable, delivered the perfected great sages and honored deities of the ten directions’ heavens.

Had it not been for the turning of the Dharma-wheel, none would have encountered this. Here ends the Register of the Three Honored Ones of Supreme Purity.
