**Preface to *The Golden Lotus Orthodox Record***

The Dao has no beginning or end, yet the teachings follow succession.
Some say: "Is the Dao not different from the teachings?"
I say: "They are different."
The Dao is the profound and eternal stillness; the teachings transmit the law and guide humanity.
The Dao’s essence, though spanning countless kalpas, remains unaltered.
The teachings’ function waxes and wanes—sometimes declining, sometimes flourishing.

Some ask: "From whence did the teachings arise?"
I say: When the Yellow Emperor of the Xuānxu line cast the tripod and ascended the Fire Dragon into the boundless void, then did the saying of longevity and eternal vision emerge. Though the doctrine existed, only seventy-two followed it in practice.
Later, in the reign of King Wǔdīng of the Shang, the Old Master manifested at Lèiyáng, traversing the Wei Pass to the east and the Flowing Sands to the west, teaching for nine hundred ninety-six years. Then, astride a white deer, he ascended the Azure Cypress, transcended the Azure Deeps, and wandered the Jade Capital.
Yet despite such marvels, people still doubted and failed to embrace the truth.

When the Han Celestial Master Zhāng Jìngyìng emerged, he personally received the Orthodox One Scripture, battling demons to establish the Blessed Court, ordaining Daoists as the Sacrificial Master. His teachings flourished, transforming the four seas.
He was succeeded by Kǎo, Hào, Dù, and Yè, who exorcised demons and dispelled calamities, accumulating blessings and averting disasters, aiding the state and saving the people, acting as Heaven’s emissaries. For countless generations, monasteries thrived, and emperors revered them.
After the Zhenghé era, the Lin Celestial Master repeatedly displayed divine transformations, and the emperor took faith in him. Though the teachings prospered, the doctrine of nature and life remained obscured and unexplored.

Then, at the end of the Flaming Song dynasty, Zhòngyáng emerged anew, reviving the teachings and focusing solely on nature and life. He transformed the Three Zones and united the Five Assemblies, placing the Golden Lotus at the forefront. Wandering the seas, he initiated seven disciples, embodying gentleness and humility outwardly, quietude and emptiness inwardly, the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions in essence, and myriad transformations in adaptability. He renamed the school *Quánzhēn* (Complete Reality) and altered the robes to incorporate the Eight Trigrams.

When our Long Spring Master Qiū Shénxiān received the emperor’s summons and answered the invitation from Yīnshān, he admonished against excess in wine and desire, warned against excessive slaughter, and with a single sincere word, brought spring to ten thousand nations. He rescued countless souls from the brink of suffering, and all hearts turned toward him as rivers flow to the sea. The sturdy and the youthful alike bowed in reverence, while the barbarians of the east and west composed hymns to *Bùxū* (the Uncarved). Families discussed the Dao and Virtue, and everywhere, the teachings of *Xīyí* (the Mysterious and Profound) were expounded. Lazy robes and unbound hair filled the roads, while jade halls and celestial altars dotted the mountains and valleys. Since the time of Xuānxu, no era has seen the Daoist path flourish as it does today.
This teaching originates from Zhōnghuá (Central Harmony), flourishes under Zhòngyáng, and branches from Chángchūn. From this point onward, its influence will surge like an overflowing river, its limits unknown. Thus, *The Golden Lotus Orthodox Record* is composed.

Written in the year *Sīnchǒu* (1231), the *Píngshuǐ* era, under the *Chángchūn Hútian* banner.

**East华 Emperor-Jun (Dōnghuá Dìjūn)**
The Emperor-Jun bore the surname Wáng, with the courtesy name Xuánfǔ, and the Daoist title Zhōnghuá Zǐ.
From birth, he exhibited extraordinary bearing, and in youth, he revered the Daoist Way. The Upper True One of White Clouds saw and loved him, saying: *"A celestial exile sent down from Heaven."*
He was then led into the mountains, where he received the Green Talismans and Jade Seals, the Golden Precepts and Sacred Scriptures, the Great Elixir’s secret formulas, and the Fire Controller’s Green Dragon Sword method of the Nine Heavens.
The Master treasured these teachings with devotion, and after three years of diligent study, mastered their profundities.
He then retired to the Yānjiàn Mountains’ Misty Ravine, nurturing his spirit and cultivating his essence.
After some time, he built a thatched hut and dwelled there, inscribing the plaque as *Zhōnghuá Guān* (Central Harmony Monastery). For over a hundred years, he concealed his light and hid his traces, unknown to the world.
Later, he moved to the southern mountains of Dài State’s Wǔtái, where the Purple Treasury Celestial Cavern now stands, and below, the Daoist County.
Though he lived among mortals for hundreds of years, he showed no signs of aging. He expounded the Mysterious Sovereign’s teachings, elucidating their wonders, performing hidden deeds for the benefit of all, and his virtue moved Heaven itself. Thus, the Celestial True One bestowed upon him the title *Zhōnghuá Dìjūn* (East华 Emperor-Jun), also called the *Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Treasury*.
He initiated his disciple, the Pure Yang True Person Zhōnglí Yúnfáng, to succeed and propagate the teachings.
The sacred and distant cannot be fully recorded here. The Quánzhēn Dao originates from him, hence he is established as the **First Ancestor of Complete Reality**.

A scholar remarked: *"The Emperor-Jun’s celestial name is so resplendent, his Daoist worth so towering—why is he not recorded in the Han histories? His lineage, birthplace, and deeds are so obscure."*
I respond: *"Daoist cultivation often involves seclusion. It is not the urgent priority of establishing teachings for the world, so historians omit or lose track of such figures. Moreover, Confucian scholars disdain speaking of such matters. Over time, inscriptions fade, and thus, we cannot fully discern them.
Even in the four hundred years of the Han dynasty alone, the number of recluses and hermits is incalculable. How could a few thousand scraps of paper ever record them all?"*

The Dao/Way of Complete Reality has long been brewing. From the **Celestial Worthy** it was passed down to **Golden Mother**, then to **White Cloud**, and finally to **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). Heaven, in its intent, entrusted this grand teaching to such a one—how could mere pedants ever bear its weight? Emerging from the **Crimson Cloud and Vermilion Landscape** (紅霞丹景), he was carefully selected as the leader of all the immortals, then descended to the mortal realm.

At first, his arrival was not without marvelous and extraordinary signs—his radiance dazzling Heaven and Earth! Yet they were hidden and not recorded, for historians dread such things. Thus, they are explicitly stated at the end of the transmission, lest scholars read them without proper reflection.

The verse says:
*"Obscurely rising, the Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,
The refined elegance of the Purple Palace, the Minor Yang’s abode.
Kunlun looms high, its radiance stretching a thousand feet,
When first it blooms, the Complete Reality’s foremost flower."*

**Zhònglí True Person of Rectified Yang** (正陽鍾離真人) reverently notes from *The Record of Lu Mountain’s Golden Spring Observatory* (《庐山金泉观记》):
*"His great-great-grandfather, surname **Pu** (朴),
His grandfather, surname **Shǒudào** (守道),
His father, surname **Yuán** (源),
All during the late **Later Han** (後漢) era,
Held strategic positions, with merit to the nation,
Their virtues enduring through generations."*

The Master, surname **Zhòng** (鍾), given name **Quán** (權), courtesy name **Yúnfáng** (云房), styled **Zhònglí** (正陽子), was a native of **Hànchāng Xiànyáng** (京兆咸阳).

Young, he excelled in letters and calligraphy, especially favoring the **Grass Script** (草圣). His height was eight feet seven inches, his beard extended past his navel, and his eyes held divine light.

He rose to the rank of **Left Advisor** (左谏议大夫), but after submitting a memorial criticizing **Li Jiān’s** (李坚) mismanagement of border affairs, he was exiled as **Commander of Nánkāng** (南康知军). After the **Han** (漢) dynasty fell, he again served under the **Jìn** (晉).

During the reign of **Emperor Wǔ** (武帝), he led troops alongside the general **Zhōuchù** (周处), but their campaign faltered, and they fled into the chaotic mountains, their whereabouts unknown. Chance led him to encounter a **Laozi** (老氏) adept, who, when questioned, remained silent but pointed toward **Bùnán** (束南). He immediately journeyed there.

After six or seven miles, towering peaks rose abruptly, pine and cypress trees stood in uneven ranks, and within, a pavilion gleamed with golden splendor, its radiance awe-inspiring. Two **Qīngyī** (青衣) attendants stood at the gate, and he bowed, asking: *"What place is this?"*

They replied: *"The dwelling of the Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Palace (紫府少陽君),
And the secondary estate of the **Bùhuá Imperial Sovereign** (束華帝君).
Your teacher, **Hóu Jūn** (侯君), has long resided here."*

They then invited him inside, where he bowed and saw the **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). As they conversed and laughed, a boy announced: *"A guest-immortal has arrived!"*

The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) went out to greet the three immortal guests. **Zhònglí** (鍾離) peered from the window and saw:
*"The first immortal stood eight feet tall,
Wearing green robes with white sashes,
Grass sandals and a cloud-patterned cap,
His eyes flashing with divine light—majestic indeed!*
*The second, clad in a plain white robe with wide sleeves,
Tied behind his neck, held a iron flute across his chest.*
*The third, robust and imposing,
Wore a crimson robe, a **Huáyáng** (華陽) headwrap,
Straddled a **Cāngmáo** (苍毛) tiger,
And grasped a staff horizontally."*

They then led the three immortals into the secondary hall, offering wine, fruits, and fine dishes. Their laughter and camaraderie echoed beyond the hall.

The **Qīngyī** (青衣) asked:
*"How many dusty guests arrive here?
By what means do they come?
The cave’s door lacks locks or keys—
For whom is it opened today?"*

The immortals all laughed:
*"Once you were **Tiěyī** (鐵衣) child,
Now you meet one who has attained the Dao/Way (達道人).*
*How dare a mighty warrior intrude upon this sacred ground!"*

The **Iron Flute Immortal** (鐵笛仙) said:
*"The Minor Yang’s Purple Palace,
The Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,
Pouring cups of wine aged a thousand days,
Ever blooming flowers of the four seasons—*
*Let the **Rú** (阮) family enjoy them!"*

The **Tiger-Riding Immortal** (跨虎仙) said:
*"Your teacher personally points the way to **Pénglái** (蓬莱),
Why seek further guidance?
The immortals know their destined paths—
Fortunate indeed to bow before the High True One!"*

The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) replied:
*"Noble are you, O **Qīngyún** (青云) vessel,
Our meeting brings joy to my face.
The **Red Terrace** (丹台) has its records,
Yet I have been temporarily exiled among mortals."*

The immortals all drank deeply, then departed. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) saw them off, each ascending to the sky astride a **Luán** (鸾) or **Fèng** (凤) with effortless grace. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) then returned and spent the entire day in profound discussion with **Zhònglí** (鍾離), their bond of affection deeper than that of old friends.

He then transmitted to him:
*The **Red Seal and Jade Inscription** (赤符玉篆),
The **Golden Precepts and Sacred Writings** (金科灵文),
The **Great Elixir Secrets** (大丹秘诀),
The **Fire Marshal of the Five Circuits** (周天火侯),
And the **Green Dragon Sword Method** (青龙剑法).
**Zhònglí** (鍾離) reverently received these teachings,
And upon hearing them once, his understanding reached a thousandfold.*

After mastering their depths, he bid farewell and descended the mountain, wearing a simple **Zhuīzì** (椎髻) hairstyle and coarse garments. He practiced **accumulating virtue** (积行) to save others, refined his **spirit** (调神) and cultivated his **qi** (炼气), his transformations ever unpredictable.

During the **Kāichéng** (开成) era of **Emperor Wénzōng** (文宗) of the **Táng** (唐), while wandering **Lúshān** (庐山), he encountered **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公), the **Cave Guest** (洞宾), who taught him the **Heavenly Escape Sword Method** (天遁剑法), and he called himself the **Scattered Daoist of All Under Heaven** (天下都散汉).

Later, he secluded himself at **Yángjiǎo Shān** (羊角山) in **Jìn** (晉), where the **Celestial Worthy** (天真) bestowed upon him the title **Tàijí Zuǒgōng Bǎoshēng Zhēn rén** (太极左宫保生真人).

He once inscribed two poems behind the **Guan’āyī Hall** (观音殿) at **Qǐngzhōu Kāiyuán Temple** (邢州开元寺), their strokes soaring like dragons in flight. The poems read:
*"To meet a true immortal is no easy thing,
When shall I return, and wish to follow you?
My dwelling connects with the **Stárng** (沧) Sea,
A separate peak, the foremost of **Pénglái** (蓬莱).*
*Again it says:
Do not weary of joyous pursuits and frequent laughter,
Yet ponder the sorrows of separation and strife.
In leisure, I count with bent fingers from the start,
How many have attained **Qīngpíng** (清平)?"*

In the **Sòng** (宋) dynasty, **Liú Cóngguǎng** (刘从广) erected a stone stele and had it inscribed during the **September Ninth** (九月九日) of the **Huángyòu** (皇佑) era, the fourth year. There is also an ode that reads:
*"To see money as a plague, O True Immortal Child,
To meet women with the bearing of a virtuous gentleman.
Cultivating **qi** like a turtle’s slow breath,
Refining the form to resemble a crane’s skin.
Born at the gate of life, yet die at the door of death—
How many are the awakened, how many the enlightened?
Last night, the Iron Warrior pondered deeply,
Long life and immortality—by whom are they achieved?"*

He also compiled *The Collection of True Immortals Transmitting the Dao/Way* (《真仙传道集》) alongside *The Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao* (《灵宝毕法》), passing them to **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公). He spoke of the **Dao/Way of Internal Elixir** (内丹养命), where **Yīn** and **Yáng** harmonize within the **Great Transformation of Heaven and Earth** (天地造化), hidden in the **Mystic Treasury of the Dark Realm** (玄都宝藏) as a mirror for all ages.

Afterward, he again visited **Lúshān** (庐山), ascending the **Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion** (三级红楼) and effortlessly rising into the sky on the **twentieth day of the fifth month** (五月二十日).

The eulogy states:
*"The Dao/Way cannot be attained through empty deceit,
Nor can immortality be achieved through falsehood—
Only true practice and genuine cultivation are honored."*

Before his enlightenment, **Zhèngyáng Zǐ** was but a warrior clad in iron armor. Yet after paying homage to **Bùshù Huà Dìjūn**, he received the **Jade Seal of Authority** to commune with Heaven, followed the **Golden Precepts** to move the Earth, forged a sword so that the **Azure Dragon** entered its sheath, and refined the elixir so that the **Crimson Phoenix** ascended to the Primordial. He cultivated **qi** until his breathing resembled that of a tortoise, and refined his form until his skin was like a crane’s. Over five hundred years—from the Han to the Tang—only one **Pure Yang** Immortal was granted transcendence. How rare it is for mortals to be transformed!

Later, he wandered **Lúshān**, ascending the **Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion** and drifting upward into the **Great Void**. From then on, the **Quánzhēn** teachings gradually took shape, and thus he became the **second patriarch of the Jīnlián Orthodox Line**.

The verse says:
*"Once heard the Iron-Flute Immortal astride a tiger,
Now the Golden Elixir passed from the Celestial Sovereign.
At parting, he entrusted it to Pure Yang Zǐ—
On the Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion, beneath the azure sky."*

According to the *Record of the Stone Inscription at Yuezhou Qingyang Observatory*, his great-grandfather was named **Jǐng**, rising to the rank of **Hanlin Academician and Grand Guardian of the Imperial Library**. His grandfather, **Xiàn**, held the post of **Governor of Henan Prefecture**, and his father, **Wèi**, served as **Minister of Rites**. The Master himself was named **Yán**, with the courtesy name **Dòngbīn**, a native of **Púyì, Pú Prefecture** (modern-day **Púyì, Yǒnglè**).

Born on the **fourteenth day of the fourth month, in the year Gēngzǐ of Emperor Dèzōng’s Xīngyuán era (827 CE)**, beneath a tree in the **Forest of Birds**, he later achieved the **Jìnshì degree in the year Dīngyǒu of Emperor Wénzōng’s Kāichéng era (840 CE)**, at the age of twenty-two. With a **dragon-like bearing and phoenix-like eyes**, his sparse yet refined brows and beard bore the **metallic and waterly marks** of destiny. He wore the **Huáyáng cap** and **Xiāoyáo robes**, his demeanor resembling that of **Zhāng Zǐfáng** or **Sīmǎ Qiān**.

Later, he served as **Magistrate of Lúshān’s Wǔfēng County**, and during his leisure, he explored the mountain’s wonders. There, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**, and after exchanging but a few words, their hearts aligned. He received the **Great Dao of Heavenly Escape Swordsmanship** and the **Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir’s Secret Scriptures**, and was bestowed the title **Pure Yang Zǐ**.

From that point onward, he resigned his office and titles, devoting himself entirely to the **Dao/Way**, their bond unbreakable as **glue and lacquer**. Soon after, several Immortals personally invited him to the **Gathering of Penglái**. **Lǚ Gōng**, tears streaming, knelt and pleaded with his master: *"When shall we meet again in the Cloud-Car?"*

He then composed a poem in reply:
*"At the moment of fulfillment, reunion is hard to find,
Yet now I hear you depart for the Celestial Platform.
A staff-top spring in a goblet of wine,
A crown of clouds piercing the Five Peaks.
The Tortoise of the Sea knows no man,
The符符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*

After this, **Lǚ Gōng** hid himself in Shìyáe, sometimes selling elixir to cure the sick and relieve their sufferings, sometimes offering ink to aid the poor. Through accumulated merit and righteous deeds, he ultimately attained true **Dao/Way** mastery, his transformations boundless—now hidden, now revealed. He often traveled between Cāngwú and Nányuè, and once wrote a poem:

*"Morning I wander in the Southlands, evening in Cāngwú,
My sleeves hold the **qi** of a green serpent, bold and vast.
Three times I entered Yùyáng, yet none recognized me,
Highly reciting as I flew over Dòngtíng Lake."*

During the **Song Dynasty**’s Zhènghé era, the **Lǚ Gōng** of Luòyáng’s Shàngqīngguān inscribed two couplets:

*"I came twice to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones,
Yet the myriad beings of the Four Great Elements see them not.
Now I return to the dusty world below,
In the depths of the Five Clouds, the **Dao/Way**-realm points."*

And again:

*"In the depths of the Five Clouds lies my homeland,
Beyond the Four Great Elements—no longer can I dwell.
Today I know not if I am a guest,
For tomorrow I’ll remain here, beside."*

During the **Wùzǐ** year’s Mid-Autumn Festival, a practitioner of the **Dao/Way** came to visit **Lǚ Gōng** at his residence in Xījīng. The host obstructed him, but **Lǚ Gōng** was already seated in the hall with an imposing presence. He said, *"I beg a hundred cups of wine."* The host granted them, and he drained them in one sitting. Then he requested three *chǐ* of plain silk, which he dipped in wine, folded, and placed in the bottle before departing without farewell. The host quickly ordered a pursuit, but **Lǚ Gōng** had vanished. Upon opening the bottle and unfolding the silk, they found a painted image—his likeness without distinction, **Dao/Way**-clear and refined, with three fine hairs protruding from his ears. Later, he inscribed two more couplets:

*"To nourish life, one must drink a hundred cups,
To cultivate longevity, let the **Yellow River’s clarity** be the measure.
The **Dao/Way** renews itself each day with boundless wisdom,
The **Way** unfolds early, as thunder splits the earth’s core."*

And again:

*"A body of **obstinate freedom** through ages past,
Yet only the **Supreme Good** can reveal its truth.
How many thoughts and deeds I’ve received from your teaching,
Now floating in the **Dao/Way**-realm, leaving the mundane behind."
He was later titled **Pure Yang Master**.

During the **Xuānhé** era of the **Song Dynasty**, at **Dàiyuèguān** in **Tàishān**, he inscribed a couplet on the stone wall:

*"Long ago I left my mark here when I came,
Now my deeds fulfill the Nine Regions of the world."*

Later, when thunderous rains struck and **dragon-kind** battled in the skies, the mountain’s cliffs crumbled—yet **Lǚ Gōng**’s ink traces remained untouched. Ninety years later, when another visitor returned, he inscribed another couplet:

*"The dragons know my intent, so leave no trace,
They spare my mark from being buried deep."*

And again, a single stanza:

*"Long ago I wandered here,
Ninety springs have passed since then.
How many dusty travelers,
Who would recognize me now?"*
He later signed it as *"Huígōng’s work."*

His manifestations varied with each place, too numerous to record. In his lifetime, he wrote hundreds of works, collectively titled *The Sword Transmission Anthology*. His soaring transformations were countless—those who followed him could not fathom their number.

Later, in his travels to **Èzhōu**, ascending the **Huánghè Lóu** at noon on the twentieth day of the fifth month, he rose into the clouds, his form barely visible. The common folk gazed in awe, yet only saw him vanish into the mist.

The praise reads:

*"From ancient times, those who attained the **Dao/Way** and became Immortals were many, yet why does **Lǚ Gōng**’s name alone stand out? It is because his heart of **compassion and mercy** extends to all, benefiting beings without limit, and touching them most deeply. Even the **old pine’s essence**—a lifeless thing—was taught with care, transformed into the **Supreme God**. How much more so for humans, the most refined of all beings!

Three times he entered **Yùyáng**, bearing the **elixir’s longevity** for a thousand years.
Revisiting **Dàiyuèguān**, he recited the *Sutra of the Yellow Court* in the two halls.
He sought the **essence** of the **Red Phoenix** in the southern lands,
And the **marrow** of the **Black Tortoise** from the northern seas.
One grain secures transcendence beyond the world,
Nine refineries scatter blessings among all.
He turned stones into gold with a touch,
And willow branches into bones with a fold.
Those who took his elixir regained youth and vitality,
Those who met him rose from death, their bodies restored.

A hundred strange forms concealed him,
His sleeves held the **Dao/Way**-sword of a green serpent.
A decree from the Nine Heavens descended,
His body flew from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s heights.

Thus it is said: a name is a public treasure of the world,
Not to be claimed by many—how true it rings!"*

The poem reads:

*"Three *chǐ* of green serpent **qi** chills the heart,
Heaven and Earth shift at my touch.
Once I left from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s peak,
Leaving behind **elixir** for mortals to trade."*

**Master Sìu of the Sea Hare**
The Master’s surname was **Sìu**, his given name **Cāo**, with the courtesy name **Zōngchéng**, and the sobriquet **Hǎi’án Gōng**. He was a native of **Yànshān**.

At sixteen, he was selected in the **Míngjīng** examination for the **Jiǎkē** rank, advancing through promotions to the position of **Chancellor**. He always favored discussions on **nature and life**, yet never grasped their profound mysteries.

One day, a **Daoist** came to pay respects. The Master invited him to sit in the hall, treating him as a honored guest, and asked for his name. The visitor remained silent, only calling himself **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**, and requesting ten **parrot eggs** and a single **gold coin**. The Master placed the coin on his palm and stacked the eggs high, precariously balanced—yet they did not fall.

The Master sighed, *"Perilous indeed!"*

The visitor replied, *"Your Excellency’s life and fortune are both in greater peril than this."*

The Master awoke to the truth, and the visitor then gathered the eggs and hid them, while discarding the coin. He then bade farewell and departed.

The Master thereupon hastened to arrange a nightly banquet, feigning intoxication. He hurled cups, plates, and treasures to the ground, shattering them. His wife and children, along with servants, all angrily rebuked him.

Yet even after the morning court session, his face remained grim. He untied his official seal and resigned from office, then acted madly, singing and dancing.

He composed a song of his own, saying:

*"I, the **Lǜ Tàisuì**, was born in Yàn,
Recalling how the **Three Lights** shared their **qi** with me.
In the **Mǎo Angle**’s brilliance, my heart stood clear as frost and snow,
At sixteen, I swiftly ascended to the **Jìakē** rank.

With **Jū** and **Zǐ** robes, I bore the **golden seal**’s honor,
While others adorned themselves in **embroidered silks**, their bodies lightly encumbered.
Now my station reaches the **highest** of **official seals**,
Yet in a blink, all past joys are lost—like a spring dream’s fleeting sigh.

Last night, at the third watch, the family feast was grand,
My brother, sister, and wife all waited upon me like servants.
I feigned drunkenness, overturning cups and plates,
Smashing **coral** and **precious jade** treasures to dust.
Children scorned me, my wife loathed me,
They forgot the past pleasures of clothing, food, and ease.

This morning, my anger still lingers at court’s retreat,
For even a minor fault, I dare not excuse.
From this deed, I now realize—
Who will save me from the **wheel of rebirth**?
I resign my office, return my seal, and abandon worldly glory,
With fervor, I seek a path to escape this mortal coil."*

Thus, he changed his garments and dwelled in humble places,
To shame his former form.

He also wrote a couplet:

*"I cast aside the **fire dwelling** with its three thousand dependents,
I banish the **gate guards** of my hundred thousand household."*

Later, he wandered far into the **Qín River basin**,
Refining his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**,
Hiding his traces beneath **Zhōngnán**,
Nurturing his **qi** and purifying his mind—
Until he attained **true perfection**.

One day, in **Dàizhōu**’s **Shòuning Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **"Cùihè Qíshòu"** (Tortoise and Crane of Equal Longevity)**,** over a span of more than a **zàng** (yard). He also inscribed his own likeness on the wall, followed by a request.

Later, in **Chéngdū’s Qīngyáng Guān** in **Xīshǔ**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **"Qīng’ān Fúshòu"** (Serene Peace and Blessed Longevity)**.**
In **Dàizhōu’s Fènghuáng Shān**, at the **Láiyí Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **"Shòushān Fúhǎi"** (Longevity Mountain and Auspicious Sea)**.**
Though these three places were separated by thousands of **lǐ** (miles),
He wrote them all on the same day—
To display his boundless **divine transformations**.

Afterward, he inscribed a lengthy poem, saying:

*"Drunkenly riding a white donkey, I came,
And the copper **tail** was dragged in disdain.
A **green-eyed barbarian** led me along,
Carrying a **lean bamboo staff** on his shoulder.
I forgot the affairs of the dusty world,
My home now is **Gě Hóng’s well**.
I do not study the **Huángtíng Jīng**,
Nor do I boil the **Lónghǔ Dǐng**’s elixir.
Standing alone in the **urban markets**,
I accept no invitations from the vulgar crowd.
I wish to take up the **Pīlì Jīn**,
And ascend to **Kūnlún’s peak**.
I bought **ten horns** from the **Hángniú**,
And plowed **half a field** in the **stream’s domain**.
Planting **millet** and brewing **white wine**,
That is the **Daoist’s** tranquil scene.
Drunkenly reclining beneath ancient pines,
I converse with **white clouds** on the **ridge**.
If I wish to depart, I depart immediately,
Vanishing into the **shadow of an autumn hair**’s breadth.
Though his **manifestations** were many across the **realms of transformation**,
I recount only his grandest deeds.

The **eulogy** reads:

*"How great the difficulty of attaining wealth and nobility!
How great the difficulty of abandoning them!
Yet if one can attain and then abandon them,
There is none who will not ascend to the **Great Luo** and wander in **Yùjīng**.*
From ancient times to the present,
I have seen this in **Master Sìu of the Sea Hare** alone.

From the **Jìnshì** rank, he rose to **Chancellor of Yàn**,
With **golden seals** in hand, his kindness extended to **nine clans**,
His **purple girdle** bore his name across the **four quarters**.
One day, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**,
And understood the peril of the **gold coin**’s stacking—
He sighed at the **Mǎo Angle**’s ultimate danger,
Shattered the **seven treasures** to turn them to dust,
And regarded **ten thousand gold** as filth.
He cast aside the **fire dwelling** of three thousand souls,
And banished the **gate guards** of a hundred thousand households.
He resigned his office and danced madly on the **market cliffs**,
Returned his seal and dwelled in the **mountain wilds**.
Refining his **qi** beneath **Zhōngnán**,
Nurturing his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**—
Thus, he could **tread upon water and fire** without harm,
Pierce **gold and stone** yet face no obstruction.
He rode a **purple phoenix**,
Held the **Pīlì Jīn** in his hand,
Rode a white donkey in drunken revelry,
And trod upon **Kūnlún’s peak**.
He splashed ink to form four characters,
Changing his form while separated by thousand-mile mountains—
Truly, the **Dao** does not betray those who see it!

Indeed, the poem says:
*"Smashing coral treasures, they do not invite me to feast,
I return to the **high peaks**, where white clouds drift.
The **Buddha’s lute** ascends straight to **Kūnlún’s summit**,
Laughing at the **fleeting years** of mortal life."*

**Master Zhōngfāng of Chóngyáng**
The Master’s given name was **Zhōngfāng**, with the courtesy name **Jiǔqīng**.

「His family lineage originated from **Hànyáng** [咸阳], the foremost of the rightful clans [右族], in the region where the **Liú Jiāng** [刘蒋] rivers and bamboo groves mingled with misty peaks and refreshing breezes [水竹烟霞爽恺之地]. There, he established a separate villa, intending it as his final resting place.

As for his person, he possessed a sturdy and imposing frame [骨木雄壮], a grand and profound **qi** presence [气象浑厚], eyes larger than his mouth, and a beard longer than his belly. His voice rang like a bell [声如钟], and his complexion gleamed like jade [面如玉]. With a **Dao** aura of unceasing freshness [清风飘飘], and a **qi** of vibrant purple radiance [紫气郁郁], he bore the countenance of one dwelling in the vastness of lakes and seas [湖海之相].

His physical strength surpassed that of ordinary men [膂力倍人], and his talent was unmatched by common folk [才名拔俗]. Early in life, he mastered the **Classics** and histories [蚤通经史], and later trained in archery and swordsmanship [晚习弓刀].

When the **Qí Fù** [齐阜] and **Chāng Wèn** [昌问] prefectures were abolished, he presented an ode to the **Spring Officials** [春官], yet was dismissed for not conforming to their expectations. Later, he took the **military examination** [武举], and thus attained the highest rank [甲科].

At the age of forty-seven, he sighed deeply and said: *"Confucius was free from doubt at forty, and Mencius remained unmoved in heart at forty. I have surpassed them in years, yet still I devour raw flesh and peck at rotten bones, toil for purple robes and hoard gold—is this not the height of folly?"* He then resigned from office, broke his official seal [解印], cast aside his wife and children, dusted off his robes and left the worldly affairs behind, resembling the **wandering madman of Chu** [楚狂] in his reckless abandon.

In the year **Jìmǎo** [己卯] of the **Zhènglóng** [正隆] era, when he was forty-eight, he passed by a butcher’s stall at **Gānhé Bridge** [甘河桥], savoring the marrow and chewing heartily. Suddenly, two **Daoists** [道者], each clad in white felt [白毡], emerged stealthily from the south. Their bearing was as ethereal as mist and clouds [烟霞态度], their spirit as boundless as the heavens and the sea [霄汉精神]. Observing their brows and eyes, they seemed strikingly alike.

The Master did not notice them at first but was startled to his feet and approached. He bowed his head slightly and greeted them with a forward bow [倪首前揖]. Their speech was entirely beyond the worldly [出世语], and through their words, he shed his dust and purified his stains, removed his ignorance and dispelled his blindness. It was as if he had drunk and suddenly awakened, as if he had been sick and now recovered. They secretly imparted the **authentic Daoist methods** [真诀], and he was renamed **"Zhù"** [矗], with the courtesy name **"Zhīmíng"** [知明], and styled himself **"Master Zhòngyáng"** [重阳子].

After their instruction concluded, one of the **Daoists** pointed to the southern direction and asked: *"Why do you not observe it?"*
The Master turned and looked back, but the **Daoist** said: *"What do you see?"*

The **Daoist** laughed and said: *"Is it merely this? There will also be ten thousand fragrant jade lotuses blooming!"*
Having spoken, he suddenly vanished.

From then on, the Master wandered aimlessly, unconstrained, begging for food in the markets, clad in a patched raincoat and a broken gourd bowl, sleeping beneath the ice and snow outside. He composed a verse:

*"At forty-eight, I first encountered them,*
*And when the **authentic Daoist methods** were imparted, my efforts bore fruit.
*A single grain of **golden elixir** grows ever more refined—*
*On **Yùjīng** Mountain’s peak, its crimson hue shines bright.*

The following year, in the **Gēngshēn** [庚辰] cycle, there was a **Daoist** who shared his lodging. Mid-month, the **Daoist** spoke: *"I dwell in the vast mountains of the west-north. There, someone asked if there were any who excelled in expounding the **Yīnfú** [《阴符》] and **Dàodé** [《道德》]—especially those who were well-versed in them. I heard you have long favored these two **scriptures**, yet why do you not follow me? Come and listen to my teachings."*

The Master hesitated, unable to respond immediately. The **Daoist** suddenly rose, cast aside his staff, and rode the wind away. His attendants searched for him, but there was no trace—only a lingering sense of loss, as if something had been irretrievably gone.

「When the time came to the **Mid-Autumn Festival**, passing through **Líquán** County, the Master encountered the **Daoist** again. He hastened forward and bowed to him. The **Daoist** then invited him into a tavern, where they drank together. During their conversation, the Master inquired about his homeland, and the **Daoist** replied: *"I reside in **Púzhé Yǒnglè** [蒲圾永乐]."*

The Master further asked his age, and the **Daoist** answered: *"Twenty-two years of spring and autumn."*"

When asked about his lineage, the **Daoist** remained silent. The Master then requested a brush and paper to record five secret teachings, which he instructed the Master to read carefully. The Master read them repeatedly before grasping their profound principles, and he solemnly warned: *"The celestial **Dao/Way** must not be carelessly revealed."* He immediately ordered the papers burned in the fire.

The **Daoist** said: *"Hurry to **Shùhǎi** [束海], where in the **Qiū Liú Tán** [丘刘谭] region there is a noble steed. You may capture it."* Having spoken, he vanished without trace.

The first of these teachings read:
*"Suddenly arriving in **Qín** lands, wandering through **Cháng'ān**, some sell **elixir** in the marketplaces, others hide their traces in the mountains and forests. Following such paths for years, one sees countless **common folk**, all coarse and wicked—mere **lower demons**. Now you meet my disciple, why not abruptly cast aside the **mundane world**, awaken fiercely to its vanity, and relish **dew of the clouds** before the **jade capital’s** splendor? Fit to refine **qi** beneath the **pine peaks**, you may govern **creation** and reverse the **yin-yang**, arraying the **constellations** within the **Nine Cauldrons** and gathering **all transformations** into a single **cauldron**. With a thousand days of merit fulfilled, your name will be inscribed in the **Immortal Registers**; after three years of diligence, you shall eternally pacify the **eons** of **samsara**. Fear that your tardiness may cause your body to sink into the **underworld’s depths**."*

The second teaching read:
*"Do not cling to **wine and feasting** in the **mundane world**, nor let yourself be bound by earthly concerns.
When **Dragon** and **Tiger** stir, snowflakes scatter like waves;
where the water’s voice is clear, the **profane dust** dissolves.
Since my awakening on the **path**, my words have strayed but still hold meaning.
One day, when the **Nine Refined Elixir** is complete,
I shall depart with my companions to **Pénglái**."*

The third teaching read:
*"The **Qiao Dragon** is refined in the **Fire Beacon Pavilion**,
the **Meng Tiger** captured to ensnare the **Water Spirit**.
Do not force the **Dao/Way** nor debate its principles—
such **errant talk** only complicates matters."*

The fourth teaching read:
*"Lead is the **medicine of mercury**,
mercury the **essence of lead**—
knowing lead and mercury,
**nature abides** and **life is suspended**."*

The fifth teaching read:
*"When the **Nine Refined Elixir** is perfected,
enter **Nánjīng**,
find a **true friend**,
and proceed to **Péngléng**."*

The Master then returned to **Qiū Liú** [丘刘], constructing a small hermitage for himself. He inscribed upon its lintel: *"The Tomb of the Living Dead"* [活死人墓], and erected a paper plaque above it reading: *"The Position of King Harm-Wind’s Spirit"* [王害风灵位]. He composed a poem:

*"The Living Dead, King Harm-Wind’s fate,
Water and clouds—another kind of harmony.
The **Daoist name** calls me **Chóngyáng** [重阳] Master,
My **maddened cry** is called ‘No-Ground-Buried.’*
*The **path** of those who come,
I shall not forget—
Traveling, they must hang the **Spirit Plaque**.*

One day, he carried a single **gourd of wine** and stood by the roadside. A **Daoist** called out: *"Harm-Wind! Harm-Wind! Bring me your wine!"* The Master responded in kind, offering him a drink until the **gourd was empty**. The **Daoist** then sent the Master with the **empty gourd** to the **Sweet River** [甘河] to fetch water, commanding him to drink it himself. The water tasted exquisite—truly the **elixir of the Immortals**. The **Daoist** revealed himself: *"I am **Hǎi Chán** [海蟾], the **Master of the Sea**."* Having spoken, he vanished once more.

From that time onward, the Master no longer drank **wine**, but only **water**. He often appeared intoxicated, and thus he recounted the *"Fisherman’s Song"* [《虞美人》]:

*"Harm-Wind drinks water—how much does he know?
This way, the **mysteries** become clear.
In a **white hemp** robe, with a **green silk** headband,
His bearing is refined—truly a **spirited** man.
No need for mirrors to reflect his form,
For all things are revealed in his heart.
He discerns the **body in dreams** as the **dream itself**,
A true **free and easy wanderer** who has crossed to the **other shore**.
One day, he suddenly burned his hermitage.
Neighbors rushed to save the flames, but the Master only swayed and danced.
When asked the reason, he replied: ‘In three years, another will take up the **practice**.’
He inscribed a poem:

*'The thatched hut burns—no need for further action,
For another will soon come to **cultivate**.*
*To be **awakened** is to be **fierce**,
How can one learn my **effortless grace**?*

In the **seventh year of the Dàdìng** [大定] era, on the **twenty-sixth day of the fourth month**, he leisurely wandered toward **Shùhǎi**, passing through **Xiányáng**. There, he sketched a portrait of himself as a **three-crowned Daoist**, with **lush green pines** sheltering him, **white clouds** swirling about, and a **crane** dancing in **transcendent elegance**. Upon meeting **Shǐ Fēngxiān** [史风仙], he joyfully gave him the sketch, saying: *"Wait until I capture the **steed** and present it to you as a **companion**."*

He then traveled to **Luòyáng**, where he visited the **Upper Clarity Palace** [上清宫] and inscribed a poem on its wall:

*"Qiū, Liú, and Tán’s King Harm-Wind captures the **steed**,
On **Kūnlún’s** peak, he strikes the **jade ball**.
You still linger within the **cyclic world**,
Gaining **three thousand eight hundred measures** of merit.
At **Shùhǎi** in **Wèizhōu**, I met **Xiāo Zhēnrén** [萧真人],
Who bore **Daoist** mien and **spirit of the Way**—
I longed to guide him, lingering for days.
Yet our words did not align, so I gave him the *"Mùshān Stream"* [蓦山溪]:

*'The **True Person** has already awakened,
His fame reaches the **four seas** first.*
*Only because he has heard the **teachings**,
He remains distant from the **Supreme Primordial’s** **mystic Dao/Way**.*
*Alas, his **Immortal essence**,
Falls into a **demonic mortal form**—
Equally **decayed**, equally **aged**,
All striving toward the same end.*
*He does not know the **mysteries**,
Nor does he scorn **body and mind**.*
*Like the **deaf and blind**, he passes days,*
*Mocked for not recognizing the **elixir furnace** and **tortoise**.*
*He takes these two things,
Refines them in the **cauldron**,
And when the **elixir** is consumed,
He gains **longevity**, returning to **Péngdǎo** with his hands clasped.*

The **True Person** read it but could not fathom its **profound meaning**—he only nodded in acknowledgment.

The **Master** then continued toward **Shùhǎi**, wandering along its shores for years, **drawing and transforming** disciples. He gathered **Qiū, Liú, Tán, Mǎ, Hǎo, Sūn, and Wáng**—seven in total—thus completing the **number of the Seven Golden Lotuses**. He universally transformed **three states**, leading them to **five assemblies**:
1. **Equality** [平等],
2. **Golden Lotus** [金莲],
3. **Jade Flower** [玉华],
4. **Three Lights** [三光],
5. **Seven Treasures** [七宝].

The inscription on its lintel read:
*"I consider **Equality** the **root of Dao/Virtue and Power** [道德],
the **source of purity and struggle** [清挣],
the **foundation of the Golden Lotus and Jade Flower**,
and the **core of the Three Lights and Seven Treasures**.
It universally benefits all **living beings**,
and universally liberates the **common folk**.
Its **silver flames** fill the **eight extremes**,
and its **rainbow mists** rise to the **ten directions**.
All wish to **spit forth** at the **Yellow Sprout** [黄芽],
None linger in the **Black Path** [黑路]."*

**The Jade Flower** is the **root of qi**, the **Golden Lotus** is the **ancestor of spirit** [神]. When qi and spirit **intertwine** [相结], it is called **Divine Immortal**.

One day, he would lead **Hill, Liu, Tan, Ma** southward to **Kaifeng**. **Jar King** [瓮王] lingered in an inn for over a year, receiving much instruction. He then inscribed a verse on a bamboo staff to show them:

*"One staff named **No-Adherence** [无着],
Each node gleaming, its light blazing—
Magnificent! The **void-heart** [虚心] stands straight and firm,
Its wrapped head brimming with **elixir** [灵丹药].
Unshaken, unmoved, it rests in **tranquility** [清闲],
Yet responds to all things with **adaptive skill** [随机能做作].
It seeks **true companions** [知友] across the seas,
Who can bear to be its **leaning support** [依托]?

Last night, in a dream, I saw **all the rainbows** [诸虹],
Within them, four could leap and dance.
With a staff’s **guidance** [引],
A step’s **shift** [移],
A **silver thread** [银丝索] burst from the **crown** [顶中],
Piercing brows, revealing eyes—**spirit** [神] invigorated!
A **soul-pearl** [灵珠] gleamed forth, its light dazzling,
Bright flames ascended, all in **harmonious joy** [乐然],
White clouds did not betray the **radiant red mist** [红霞灼].
When the verse was finished, he said:

*"Long ago, the **Hairy Robe Master** [披毡师] revealed secret teachings:
**Nine transformations** [九转] complete,
To **Southern Capital** [南京] I enter,
Find **true companions** [知友],
And journey to **Penglai** [蓬瀛].
I now fulfill this promise.

His disciples were **alarmed** [惶恐], begging for words to leave behind. The Master said:
*"I inscribed them on the wall three years ago.
**Earth’s Lungs** [地肺] holds **Zhongyangzi** [重阳子],
**Strongly summon** [强呼] **Jar King** [王害风] to **wind’s aid** [风],
Come with the sun and moon,
Depart with the **setting west** [西束].
**Companions** [伴] are **Cloud and Water** [云和],
**Neighbors** [邻] are **Void and Emptiness** [虚与空].
One **soul’s true nature** [灵真性] remains,
Not shared with the common folk.

Again, he said:
**Jar King’s wind affliction** [害风] resurfaces,
His lifespan shall not exceed **fifty-eight** [五十八].
Two **Masters** [先生] will come next,
One **soul’s true nature** [灵真性] will be **searched and refined** [搜刷].

To the disciples, he said:
*"After my return, take care not to **lament** [举哀].
When he had finished speaking, he **shed his mortal form** [委蜕].

**Danyang** [丹阳] could not help but weep, deeply grieved. The crowd urged him:
*"Do not defy the **Immortal Teacher’s** [仙师] words.
**Danyang** said:
*"My **entry into the Dao** [入道] is but meager,
Yet my Teacher abandons me—**how can I return** [遑遑何归]?
His plea unfinished, he suddenly opened his eyes and said:
*"Why do you **resent** [憾恨] so?
Long ago, the **five secret teachings** [秘语] from **Ganhe River** [甘河],
I now entrust to you.
**Danyang** bowed twice, knelt, and received them.

Then to **Tan Gong** [谭公], he said:
*"Your lives are in **Danyang’s** hands.
He then addressed his **external kin** [物外亲眷]:
*"One nephew, two sons, and one **Mountain of Sorrow** [山恫],
Together with me—**five hearts of one accord** [一心雄].
Six **illumined ones** [六明] accompany the **edge-of-sky moon** [天边月],
Seven **refined spirits** [七爽] invite the **seaside breeze** [海上风].
**True Marvelous Elixir** [真妙] wraps the head,
**Hidden Perfection** [密妙] is plucked within.
Above the **void of vision** [睛空],
He treads the **emptiness of space** [虚空].
**West, south, north** [西南北] all **circle and turn** [圆转],
Only here does one know **all paths are open** [处处通].
Again, he said:
*"One brother, one nephew—two sons,
Together with me—**five refined ones** [五逸] in cultivation.
Bound as **true kin beyond the world** [物外真亲眷],
Cast off the **false union of mortal flesh** [人问假合尸].
**All-encompassing** [周匝], they **nurture** [种] the **realm of pure disputation** [清诤境],
**Passing down** [递相传授] the **Purple Elixir Branch** [紫灵枝].
At the **mountain’s summit** [山头], they **enter and exit** [进出] the **Assembly of Soul-Bloom** [灵华会],
I **attend** [趁] **Penglai** first to **pay respects** [礼师].

When the poem was done, he **quietly returned to his true nature** [奄然返真],
With **mystic fragrance** [异香] lingering thick,
**Auspicious qi** [瑞气] filling the air,
A **white crane** [白鹤] soared in the sky,
A **green mandarin duck** [青鸾] swept the earth,
His **Immortal bearing** [仙仪] ascended beyond the clouds.

**Scholars and commoners, officials and common folk** [士庶官寮] all **gazed and worshipped** [号呼瞻拜],
As if mourning a **deceased parent** [丧考妣],
None failed to **praise and marvel** [赞叹],
A **true marvel of the ages** [真千古异事].

Then, they prepared **funeral coffins and shrouds** [棺椁衣袅],
Buried him with **rites** [礼],
On the **fourth day of the first month, Regency Era of Gengyin** [大定庚寅正月初四].

After his **ascension** [升遐], beneath **Junyu Bridge** [浚仪桥], **Tan Gong** [谭] **discussed mysteries** [谈玄], **Zang Lao** [臧老]’s heart was **lured** [诱].
Beside **Liujiang Creek** [刘蒋溪], he **bestowed elixir** [赐药], curing **Master Zhang’s** [张公] affliction.
Some **danced** [舞蹈] at the **right of Kunming Lake** [昆明池右],
Some **recited verses** [吟咏] in **Zhongnan Domain** [终南境中],
All displaying signs of **immortality** [不死].

**Hill, Liu, Tan, and Ma** [丘、刘、谭、马] four disciples **clasped hands** [相拥], traveling west into **Chang’an** [长安],
Where they met **Master Shifeng** [史风先生],
Presented him with a **Pine-Crane Diagram** [松鹤图].
**Shifeng** laughed and said:
*"At that time, I left behind **No-Adherence** [勘同],
Exactly matching this diagram.
When compared, not a **hair’s breadth** [毫发] differs.
Thus, they **traversed Zhongnan** [历终南],
**Visited Liujiang** [访刘蒋],
And **dwelled in the Ancestral Hall** [住持祖庵]."

The **tomb’s adornments** were nearly complete, yet they **returned to Liang Garden** [梁园],
Together **transplanting the immortal remains** [移仙骨], opening the coffin to inspect—
**Form and spirit** [形神] still bore traces of life.

The four disciples **conferred in turn**, bearing him westward.
Wherever their journey led, they would **settle the lodging fees** [酬馆谷之资],
Yet the innkeepers would always say:
*"A Daoist of old has already paid."*

They **strived to pursue** him, yet could never catch sight.
When asked of his appearance, it was revealed as the **Ancestral Master’s** [祖师] **manifestation** [化身].

Upon arriving at **Zhongnan**, they **divined the site** [卜地] and buried him there.

**Initially**, when **Master Wang** [望仙] toured **Dengzhou** [登州],
Outside the gate, he saw the **painted bridge** [画桥] was dangerously steep,
So he spoke:
*"This bridge—when the day comes, it must be destroyed."*

None understood his meaning.
After a decade, **Magistrate He** [何公], disliking its extreme peril,
Ordered its **facade demolished** [毁其脸] and leveled the path—
Thus it became known as **Encountering the Immortal Bridge** [遇仙桥].

Later, in **Wendeng County** [文登县], a **ritual exorcism** [作醮] was held amid **Five-Colored Clouds** [五色云中],
Where a **great white tortoise** [白龟] appeared, bearing a **lotus** [莲花].
The Ancestral Master **sat upright** [端坐] upon the **lotus flower** [莲药],
Then **turned aside** [侧外] and returned.

The county magistrate, **Lady Ni** [尼厉窟], witnessed this herself,
Offered incense in reverence, and commissioned an artist to **copy his true likeness** [对写真容].
All across the three prefectures, people gazed in awe.

From **Danyang** [丹阳], one composed the *"Manting Huang"* [《满庭芳》] in praise:
*"Ancient Dengzhou, at the gate of Encountering the Immortal,
Where the painted bridge blocks all carriages.
On the Double Ninth, sacred traces appear—
Before the crowd, the family’s virtue shines.
He foretold its ruin when the time came,
A decade passed, Magistrate He found its iron treachery unbearable,
Ordered its destruction, and craftsmen rebuilt it anew.
Again in Wendeng, he manifested—
Upon a white tortoise, lotus-borne, seated in the void.
The magistrate’s green-robed reverence—
Beholding his true form.
Suddenly, he turned and reclined,
As auspicious clouds stirred, returning to the Celestial Palace.
Clearly seen, his portrait far surpasses—
Wherever one does not revere him.
Truly, he was one who died yet did not perish,
Worthy of being the **Ancestor of the Seven Immortals** [七真之祖]."*

All his **divine transformations** [神变] were boundless, too numerous to record.
He **persuaded the Daoist and secular** [劝化道俗] across the **Western Seas and Qin** [束海西秦],
Composing **long and short verses** [长歌短咏] numbering nearly a thousand—
Collectively titled *"The Complete True Before-and-After"* [《全真前后集》] and *"Cloud-Mid Records"* [《云中录》],
Illuminating the **lead-mercury-metalwood-fire** [铅汞坎离] doctrines,
Which flourished in the world.

He also **responded in verse to Dengzhou’s Daoist assembly** [登州道众书诗] and **nineteen-branch diagrams** [十九枝图].

「玉蟾和真人」:

**In Praise of the Precious Toad’s True Person** [玉蟾子]:
The seasons revolve, yet he retains the youthful vigor of eternal spring;
The Three Teachings [三教] stand distinct, yet he liberates one from life’s sorrows.
All who cultivate **Dao** [道] in thought and deed—
With a single awakening, they perfect their refinement.
In nine transformations, he points to the Way’s fulfillment,
Ascending to the Eight Gates of Immortality [登仙八门],
Taking **Long Spring** [长春] as his eternal companion.
Daring to seek the subtlest mysteries,
He further entreats to enter the **Play of the Mysterious** [投玄],
And thus becomes my humble chapter,
Recorded in the scroll’s final pages.

**His Verse** [诗]:
*"All know that constancy [常] dwells beside the Dao,
Seeking the **supreme mysteries** [玄玄], they forge a kinship.
Do not forget the Three Teachings’ wisdom,
The **Complete True** [全真] takes the eternal spring of the Four Seasons [四时] as its own.
Nurture the **Original Qi** [元气] to fullness,
Forming the **Refined Spirit** [灵神] at the **Leakless Spring** [没漏津].
May the Nineteen Radiant Branches [十九光明] fulfill my wish—
I dare invite you to share in the **True Person’s Joy** [乐天真]."*

**His Eulogy** [赞]:
The **Ancestor** [祖师] emerged in the world,
Encountering four **True Ones** [真仙] in his lifetime.
He drank from the **Sweet River** [甘河]’s single essence,
And was granted the **Five Secret Scriptures** [秘辞] of the **Five Thunders** [五篇].
The Nineteen Leaves [十九叶] passed down from the **Cinnamon Tree** [桂树],
A **million branches** [一万枝] unbroken from the **Golden Lotus** [金莲].

He raised the **Treasure Mirror** [宝镜] high,
Illuminating the **scenes within the Tripod Cauldron** [壶中之景];
The **Divine Pearl** [神珠] shone alone,
Revealing the **karmic ties beyond the Sages’ Calamities** [劫外之缘].
Who could know the **ancient Daoist lineage’s customs** [太古家风]?
They passed through sleeves and robes in secret,
Yet envied the **Name of Jade Sun** [玉阳名字],
Transmitted stealthily beneath a **bamboo parasol** [伞竹].

He cast his **hook of fate** [钧竿] into the **Great Void** [默然之海],
A **Great Sage** [大士] in silent retreat,
Later returning to his **boat of leisure** [船舫],
A **wandering recluse** [散人] in the **Pure Stillness** [清静之渊].

He became the **guide of the Great Dao** [大教权舆之主],
The **forerunner of the Complete True** [全真户牖之先].
When his merit was fulfilled and fame secured,
He then rode the **Lingering Crane and Tortoise** [跨鸾鹤],
Ascending to the **Azure Sky** [青天].

**Zhang the Divine Child’s Verse** [张神童诗]:
*"He foresaw the **Lingering Heaven of Mount Zhongnan** [终南一洞天],
Once leading the **Western Seas and Qin** [束海] to gather the **True Ones** [诸仙].
With a **single stroke of transcendent insight** [入圣超几手],
He cultivated the **Seven Golden Lotus Blossoms** [黄金七朵莲]."

---

The **Precious Toad** [玉蟾] harmonized with the **True Person** [真人].
His given name was **De Jin** [德瑾],
A native of **Ganquan, Qinzhou** [秦州甘泉].

His talents soared beyond measure,
His vision vast and his spirit refined—
His **Daoist essence** [玄资] mirrored in the clouds,
His **wondrous nature** [妙质] suspended in mist.
In his prime, he excelled in **calligraphy and literature** [翰墨].

At first, he concealed himself among **litigants and scribes** [刀笔吏],
Yet his heart remained pure and detached,
Treating the **Dao** [道] as his core,
Never taking unjust wealth.
He visited all **recluses and wandering guests** [幽人逸客],
None who did not seek his counsel.

One day, at leisure, he met a **Daoist wanderer** [道者],
Who shared wine and discussed the **mysteries** [玄].
They conversed till dawn,
And were sworn as **kindred souls** [莫逆之交].

Later, the Daoist raised an **owl** [枭] on his arm,
Entering from afar and saying to **Precious Toad** [和公]:
*"This bird is strange indeed—
Its eyes so vast, yet it cannot recognize a man.*
**Precious Toad** [公] did not comprehend,
Only nodding in polite response.

After a month, unexpectedly,
The Daoist fell gravely ill,
No physician could cure him.
In days, he passed away,
And **Precious Toad** [和公] prepared his coffin and buried him.

Yet within a few decades,
An aged woman knocked at his door, saying:
*"Long ago, a Daoist died here—
He was my true son.
Alas, I am old now,
My body drifts alone,
With no refuge or sustenance,
No means to clothe or feed myself—
Where shall I turn?"*

**Precious Toad** [和公] pitied her,
Giving her gold and silk.
The woman replied:
*"I wish to open his grave and coffin,
To gaze upon his face once more—
Then my life will have no regrets.*
Though he entreated repeatedly,
**Precious Toad** [和公] could not refuse.

When the coffin was opened,
No corpse was found—
Only the gold and silk he had given.
The woman was sought again,
But she had vanished.

**Precious Toad** [和公] sighed:
*"Such **divine transformations** [神通变化] are wondrous beyond measure—
Could any but an **Immortal Sage** [仙圣] achieve this?"*

From that moment, he was moved,
Abandoning worldly attachments,
Retiring to the forest,
Refining his **inner alchemy** [修炼] with utmost devotion,
Uniting **Dao** [道] and **Truth** [真].

Hearing that the **Zhongnan Chongyang Ancestor** [终南重阳祖师]
Mastered the **Nine Regressions’ Refining** [九还锻炼之术],
He journeyed to study with him,
Residing in the **Ancestral Hall** [祖庭],
His **Daoist insights** [玄妙] deepening daily,
His **qi** [气] growing **pure and harmonious** [冲和],
His **heart-mind** [心地] opening to clarity,
Gaining **foresight** [先见之明].

Anticipating the arrival of **Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma** [丘、刘、谭、马],
He went with **Master Li, Lingyangzi** [李公灵阳子] to a **bakery** [饼店],
Leaving four **copper coins** [分] for **soup** [羹],
And instructing the vendor:
*"Today, four **Daoist guests** [道者] will arrive—
Known as Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.
Use these to await them."*

After speaking, he returned home.
Soon, four Daoists arrived.
The vendor asked:
*"Are you not Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma?"*
The four exchanged glances and laughed:
*"How do you know?"*
The vendor replied:
*"**Precious Toad** [和] and **Master Li** [李] have left coins here for your meal."*
The four sighed in awe:
*"Truly a **True Person** [异人]."*

After eating, they went to meet him,
Their joy surpassing even old acquaintances.

Before his **ascension** [升遐] three years prior,
He commissioned an artist to paint his **true form** [真相],
And entrusted it to **Tiger Head** [虎头].
Then, he fell into a deep slumber,
None understanding his intent.

On the **19th day of the 2nd month, in the year of the Tiger** [大定庚寅岁二月十有九日],
He summoned **Master Ma, the Virtue-Keeper** [功德主]:
*"I owe you boundless gratitude,
Yet have nothing to repay.
Should you face great **calamity** [患难],
Simply burn incense and recite my name in secret—
I will come to save you."*

That day, the sky was clear and bright,
With **misty hues** [霞彩] glowing in reflection.
The **neighbors to the west** [束邻西舍] all smelled an **unusual fragrance** [异香].
Then, in his **grass hut** [草堂],
He rested on his arm,
Silently departing from the world and returning to the **Dao** [真].

Thus, he foretold his ascension in the year of the Tiger [庚寅].
After his **departure** [升遐], **Zhang the Elder of Linqiu** [临潼张叟]
Suffered long from **hernia** [疝疾],
No physician able to help,
His fate nearly sealed.

One night, in a dream,
He encountered **Precious Toad** [先生],
Who detailed the **medicinal formulas** [药饵] for his cure.
Asked of his name,
It was **Precious Toad** [和公].
Upon waking, he followed the instructions,
And his illness vanished instantly—
Proof that **Precious Toad’s spirit** [先生之神] lingers near,
And that **immortality** [不死] dwells among the **True Ones** [真]."

**His Eulogy** [赞]:
*"Great is the difficulty of transforming mortals,
Great is the difficulty of clarifying the Dao—
Even the **Precious Toad** [玉蟾子], who so longed for **Master Qi** [希夷],
Who so indulged in the **mysteries** [玄妙],
Could not awaken them.
The Daoists came to his door and formed bonds, yet he did not understand.
They employed every means to lure him, yet he did not understand.
They warned him with the **owl’s blind eyes** [臬目], yet he did not understand.
They struck him with **grave illness** [恶疾], yet he did not understand.
They revealed themselves through **corpse dissolution** [尸解], yet he did not understand.
They sent the **aged woman** [老妪] to visit him, yet he did not understand."*

「When the coffin was opened and no mortal remains were found,
And the aged woman was also lost—
Then did he know the **sages’** [圣贤] **numen** [感应] was profound,
And suddenly awoke from his **illusion** [酒然] to **enlightenment** [醒].

He abandoned his wife and children to return to seclusion in the forests and springs,
Donning the **circlet and cap** [簪冠] to diligently study **nature and life** [性命],
And bowing to **Master Zhongyang** [重阳] to master his **finger-pointed secrets** [指诀].
Through the **Nine Transformations** [九转], he perfected his **refinement** [锻炼].

**Beforehand**, he knew the **Four Guests** [四客] would come,
Understood the **direct teaching of leaving a cake** [留饼直],
And foretold the **three-year image** [三年之像].
He firmly set his **return date** [归期]—
A feat none could match.

Ultimately, he rode the **void** [空],
Walked the **empty** [虚],
And transcended his **corporeal form** [神] to enter **dreams** [梦].
Truly, the **Dao/Way** does not abandon its people.

Indeed,
**Master Zhongyang** [重阳] revealed the **elixir secret** [还丹诀],
The aged woman opened the **karmic bonds of past lives** [宿世缘],
And he laughed as he returned to the **Tiger’s Head** [虎头],
To meet in **windswept elegance** [风流] at the **Jade Lotus** [紫金莲].

**Master Lingyang** [灵阳] **Li** [李]—
His name has been forgotten,
But his **Dao-name** [道号] was **Lingyangzi** [灵阳子],
A native of **Jingzhao** [京兆] **Zhongnan** [终南].

Silent and few in words, yet his **intelligence** [聪敏] surpassed the world,
His **learning** [学问] vast and his **insight** [识量] profound.
He cherished **virtue/power** [道德] and rejected worldly fame [利名绝念],
Clearly due to his **karmic affinity** [宿契] with **Master Zhongyang** [重阳],
Who privately disclosed the **authentic Dao/Way** [真风],
Instantly dissolving his **ordinary thoughts** [俗念],
And overturning his **attachment to separation** [离颠].
He **refined** [磨] by day and **forged** [炼] by night.

Often he gathered with **Master Yushenzi** [玉蟾子] **He** [和] **Gong** [公],
Bound by **karmic ties** [因绿],
Loving others and aiding beings,
Sacrificing himself for the benefit of others,
Amassing **meritorious deeds** [阴功],
And crafting **secrets of the talismans** [密符].

**Master Zhongyang** [重阳] composed a verse:
*"Pass to He Gong and Li Gong,
First unite in purpose—three minds as one."*

When the **year of Dading** [大定] **Wushen** [戊申] arrived in the second month of spring,
The **Emperor Shizong** [世宗] dispatched envoys to summon **Master Changchunzi** [长春子] **Qiu Gong** [丘公] to the capital.
At their parting, **Master Changchun** [长春] said to **Lingyangzi** [灵阳子]:
*"The karmic ties of Liu and He,
Established by the **Patriarchs** [祖师],
Must not be disregarded—
Guard them well and uphold them."*

**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] replied:
*"Next year’s spring breeze will call back the **crane carriage** [鹤驭],
And the mountains and wilds will await my **return** [及期] as the **master of the funeral** [专待主丧].
None understood his meaning."

By the time of the following year, **Jiyou** [己酉], in the second month,
**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] was unharmed,
And he himself observed **pure abstinence** [清斋].
His disciples urged him:
*"Our teacher’s body has always been frail,
And now with no grains—
How will he endure?"*

**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] said:
*"Do not doubt—
I await only the **master of the funeral** [丧主]."*

At that time,
**Master Changchunzi** [长春子] received imperial favor and returned to his native mountain,
Passing through **Qindugu** [秦渡镇] but lingering without proceeding.
**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] sent his disciples to invite him,
And **Master Changchun** [长春] hastened there.
Upon arriving at the **hermitage** [庵中],
**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] joyfully transformed into a **yellow butterfly** [周蝶], fluttering away [栩栩而归].
Auspicious clouds swept the earth,
**Fortunate qi** [瑞气] condensed in the sky,
**Green cranes** [青鸾] lingered gracefully,
And **white cranes** [白鹤] soared—
All ranks, from officials to commoners, marveled and sighed in awe.

Thus, **Master Changchunzi** [长春子] led his disciples in preparing his **coffin and tomb** [棺椁],
And seated him in repose,
On the first day of the third month of **Jiyou** [己酉].

**His Eulogy** [赞] reads:
*"The Dao/Way of the world is unparalleled,
And the sages’ hearts are undivided.
Thus, **Wang Gong** [王公], **He Gong** [和公], and **Li Gong** [李公]
Shared the **secret teachings** [秘诀],
United in refining the **elixir** [还砂],
And in **Zhongnan** [终南], the **alchemical cassia** [丹桂] bloomed together,
While upon the **seas** [海上], the **Jade Lotus** [金莲] flourished as one.

Hence, the **Full Perfection School** [全真门] reveres them as its **Three Patriarchs** [三祖],
And worships them accordingly—
How could they be otherwise?

The verse says:
*"With both hands, he holds the **sun and moon wheels** [日月轮],
Their radiance piercing through the **newly transformed world** [万华新].
At parting, he did not lightly entrust them,
Waiting until **Master Changchunzi** [长春] became the **master of the funeral** [主人]."*

**The Golden Lotus Canon** [金莲正宗记] concludes its second scroll.
**Master Danyang** [丹阳] **Ma** [马].

「Master Ma of Ninghai, whose courtesy name was **Danyangzi** [丹阳子].
His grandfather was surnamed **Jue** [觉], with the courtesy name **Huaxiou** [华叟], well-versed in the **Five Classics** [五经], a man of **virtue** [德] and **trustworthiness** [信义], never breaking a word once spoken. He once traded silk in neighboring regions, resting at an inn in the evening, and saw a poor widow weeping alone in a secluded corner. When asked, she was said to be a **chaste woman** [贞妇], whose husband had died young, who had sworn never to remarry and instead cared for her aged parents-in-law. Alas, they both passed away, leaving her without means to bury them; she was about to sell herself to pay for the **coffin and burial chamber** [棺椁] expenses.

The Master, with a stern expression, said: *"Even when neighbors are sick, I assist them; when there is a death in the village, I do not fail to help with provisions—this is not the conduct of a **virtuous** [德] and **righteous** [义] man."* He then gave her two bundles of silk and left without inquiring her surname, hurrying to the inn ahead of her. That very night, his belongings were robbed by bandits, yet he said nothing to anyone, calmly returning home. His wife asked about it, and he feigned it was a loan.

Half a year later, the thieves quarrelled over their divided spoils, revealing the Master’s stolen goods. The Master remarked: *"The stolen items have been passed around and resold, involving many in legal trouble—this is not a single crime. I’ve endured countless investigations, and the stolen goods amount to over a hundred bolts of silk. If I had reported it, I would have faced the severest punishment. This is not the act of one who does good."* He then gave the man two taels of silver to appease his anger, and the thief departed in gratitude.

During a famine, the Master spread grain to dry in the courtyard, and a neighbor stole some. When the Master saw her, he concealed himself and let her take what she would, allowing her to leave without hindrance. His father, surnamed **Shiyang** [师扬], with the courtesy name **Xixian** [希贤], was tall and handsome, composed and measured in his bearing. He had five sons, each named after the **Five Constants** [仁义礼智信], collectively called **Wuchang** [五常]. The **Ma family** [马氏] was wealthy, earning the nickname **Mabanzhou** [马半州]. Three of his younger brothers all passed the **imperial examination** [进士], so he built a hall called **Yucheng Tang** [余庆堂], later renamed **Jiangxian Fang** [降仙坊].

By the year **Xinhai** [辛亥], famine had reached its peak. On a clear morning in the eighth month, a guest frantically tossed a **golden ingot** [细复] onto the table before rushing out without a word. The Master intended to return it by placing it in a cloth bag, but when he lifted it, its radiance was blinding. He weighed it with a balance scale, and it weighed two **jin** [镒]. Ten days later, the guest returned and the Master gave it to him. The guest thanked him, saying: *"I am **Master Lü Xian** [吕仙], from the village of **Yougu** [幽谷]. I gather herbs for a living. I obtained this two-jin golden ingot to sell in the market, but the tax collector drove me away, nearly bringing me to ruin. Thanks to you, I was spared. I wish to repay you by splitting the gold."* The Master declined, saying: *"This gold came unexpectedly; accepting it might invite misfortune."* Lü Xian insisted, and the Master refused again.

Lü Xian said: *"You possess the **auspicious features of the Yellow Emperor** [黄向之风], and in time, your descendants will rise as **Daoist immortals** [神仙].*" Thereafter, the Master often visited the **Yougu villagers** [幽谷人] and asked after Lü Xian. When told that no Lü family existed there, he suspected the man was indeed a **Daoist adept** [神人].

The Master’s mother had jade ornaments stolen by a maidservant, but when others urged him to press charges, he took no action. Thus, his wealth only grew, and he lived to the age of sixty-four. He was the second son of his family.

His son was surnamed **Congyi** [从义], with the courtesy name **Yipu** [宜甫], born on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the year **Guimao** [癸卯]. His mother, **Madame Tang** [唐氏], dreamed she was visited by **Magu** [麻姑], who gave her a **pill of elixir** [丹], which she swallowed. Its glow lingered for seven days before fading, and she clutched her fists tightly for a hundred days before relaxing them. As a child, he often recited phrases of **riding the clouds and astride a crane** [乘云驾鹤], and in dreams, he frequently accompanied Daoists in ascending to heaven.

With **forty-some dependents** [良贱四十余口], he would gather leftover food from their meals, licking the remaining grains, and wear his old clothes. Once, the Daoist **Master Li Wumeng** [李无梦] refined the **Great Elixir** [大丹] in **Kunjian** [昆箭], but after three years, it remained unfinished. He said: *"The elixir will only complete when **Daoist immortals** [神仙] descend."* One day, the Master played with a group of **bold and virtuous men** [豪杰] near the furnace, and the elixir suddenly transformed. Li Wumeng saw this and marveled, saying to the Master: *"Your forehead bears the **Three Mountains** [三山], and your hands extend past your knees—you are truly the material of a **Great Immortal** [大仙]."* He then composed a verse in praise:

*"A stately figure, round face and long ears,
Refined brows and bright eyes, straight nose and square mouth.
All features complete, a divine radiance crowns your brow—
**Yipu**, you are marked by the **Way** [道]."*

The Master, **Yipu**, received this praise and walked in harmony with **Pengzhuang** [蓬庄]. The elixir was thus perfected, and the Master’s **virtue/power** [德] became renowned. His grandson **Zhongxian** [忠显] admired Li Wumeng’s words, so he married his daughter to him, and they had three sons: **Tingzhen** [廷珍], **Tingrui** [廷瑞], and **Tinggui** [廷珪].

The Master was known for his **filial piety and respect for elders** [孝悌], and from youth, he was endowed with **keen intelligence** [聪明]. He mastered the **Classics and histories** [经史], often playing with children, and though he was **generous with wealth** [轻财], he **valued righteousness** [重义] above all. When he lent money or took pawns that could not be repaid, he burned the receipts.

In the autumn of **Dading** [大定] **Year Two**, a great locust plague and famine struck. A tenant, **Liu Jin** [刘进], stole and killed a plow ox, nearly exhausting its value. The Master went to him and said: *"The harvest has failed, and you are in dire need of food. I will provide relief, but you should not have slaughtered the ox—the very foundation of your livelihood—without cause, driving an innocent creature to its death."* He ordered Liu Jin to carry the ox’s hide himself.

The old and young wailed in grief, and the Master told them: *"The law is strict now; if you go, you will surely face punishment, and father and son will never meet again."* The Master said nothing more, then went to the **Jingge Yuan** [经阁院], offering five hides to the **Three Treasures** [三宝]—Liu Jin, kneeling before them, confessed his crime of killing the ox, hoping to clear his guilt.

People sang of him:

*"In ancient times, there was **Yang Chenghuang** [杨陈皇],
Now we speak of **Yipu** [宜甫]."*

A reckless youth came with three hundred coins to buy a **silk-lined jacket** [绫袄], but the Master gave him five hundred instead. The youth, resenting this small kindness, spat on his face. **Master Guo Fengxin** [郭奉信] scolded him and drove him away. Someone suggested wiping the spit from his face, but the Master said: *"Wiping it would defy his anger; let him dry it himself."*

The Master told his **like-minded companions** [同志]: *"Last night, I dreamed of two men, both clad in coarse robes. One had patched both shoulders, weeping as he begged me: ‘Our ten thousand lives rest in your hands.’"*

When he finished speaking, he fled into the South Lane, and I pursued him, seeing him enter the butcher’s shop of Liu Qing. Looking at the wall, I found an inscription that read:

*"Our ten thousand of the Year of the Boar [己亥],
Most have already been slaughtered in the Year of the Snake [辛巳].
If this door lacks mercy,
In every lifetime, your head will be rubbed raw."*

Upon waking from the dream, I heard the sound of pigs being slaughtered. I put on my clothes and looked—there were two bound pigs. One had white patches on both shoulders, and I realized that the man in my dream was this Year of the Boar pig. The Year of the Snake was the year Liu Gong was born. Thus, the inscription was written on the wall.

The butcher was harsh and unyielding, unable to be persuaded or transformed.

That evening, I dreamed of two cranes alighting in the vegetable garden, and so I built a Daoist hall and invited Master Lu, a Daoist priest, to reside there.

In the autumn of the Year of the Tiger [丁亥], the Master and Gao Jucai of Liaoyang were enjoying themselves at Fan Mingshu’s *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion*. After drinking deeply, he composed a poem, its final line reading:

*"Even in my drunkenness, there is one to steady me."*

None understood its meaning.

The day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Zhongyang True Person arrived from Zhongnan and reached Shumu. He went directly to the *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion*, where the Master asked: *"From where have you come?"*

He replied: *"From a journey of thousands of miles—I came only to steady the drunkard."*

All were astonished by his words. The Master then asked: *"What is your Daoist name?"*

The True Person replied:
*"Where the Five Phases do not reach,
Before one’s parents gave birth to me."*

They spoke of the Mysterious, and before long, a wind arose upon the mat.
Thus, the Master invited the True Person to dwell in his household. His wife, Lady Fuchun, lifted the curtain to behold him and said to the Master:
*"I observe your guest’s face like a red lotus leaf, his eyes as green as jade, his voice like a great bell, his speech like a gushing spring—his bearing is noble, bearing the radiance of the True Yang. He is one worthy of wholehearted reverence."*

From then on, they treated him with the rites due a teacher.

The True Person said to the Master:
*"I wish to seal myself in the hut for a hundred days without food."*

The Master complied, and a small chamber was prepared. Though winds and snows assailed it, the ink in his inkstone did not freeze. Outside, those seeking poems came and went like weaving threads; he would take up his brush, and verses would flow forth, complete in an instant.

Often, his Yang Spirit would manifest and sit in the hall. The Master sent someone to gaze upon it, and there, within the hut, he sat in solemn silence.

From the first auspicious day of the eleventh month, he revealed one poem and one word composition each, bidding the Master respond in kind. He then bestowed a single pear, which they ate together. Every five days, six yams or chestnuts were given; on the eleventh day, two pears, to be shared by the couple. Thereafter, for every ten days, the portion increased by one—three portions for thirty days, four for forty, until at a hundred days, it reached fifty-five pieces, harmonizing with the odd pairing of Heaven and Earth.

The Master gradually awakened to the True Principle and abandoned his wife and children, donning the Daoist cap and begging for alms to subdue his heart. The True Person rejoiced.

One day, the True Person spoke:
*"The Master has broken through the Dao."*

The Master asked:
*"How do you know this?"*

The True Person replied:
*"Last night, I dreamed of drinking wine. I sent someone to inquire, and the Master said, ‘I took medicine with wine and drank too much.’ I knew of it beforehand."*

He then ascended Kunjian’s Misty and Verdant Grotto. Suddenly, the Master fell gravely ill with a splitting headache, as if his skull would burst. People said:
*"The Master may not live through the morning."*

The True Person declared:
*"I traveled three thousand miles to transform this man—how could I let him die?"*
He dipped his hand in water and gave it to him. After drinking, the Master recovered.

In the autumn of the ninth year of the *Dading* era, the True Person led the Master and three others westward. The governor of Lingzhou, Xieshile, received them with teacherly rites and asked:
*"When shall we meet again?"*

The True Person answered:
*"At Liang Garden."*

Later, the True Person ascended to the clouds at Yimen. When Xieshile was later reassigned as deputy commander of the Southern Capital, he became the Master’s host for the funeral rites. After the True Person’s departure, the Master gathered his disciples and entered Jingzhao, begging for Daoist alms, obtaining tens of thousands. They then bound themselves in a vow to travel together, retrieving the True Person’s golden bones for reburial in Zhongnan. His hair was bound in three knots, and he mourned in seclusion for six years, sitting silently in his chamber.

The three knots symbolized the three auspicious characters—his posthumous name—so he held them in reverence.

The Master’s resolve was as unyielding as iron and stone, his conduct as uncompromising as frost and snow. For thirteen years, he wandered and transformed, wearing only coarse hemp, never touching money, and sleeping exposed beneath the stars. When people pitied his cold, he replied:
*"Do not marvel that I go without cover in the three winters—
I have kept one spark in my elixir field."*

One day, he told his disciple, Lai Lingyu:
*"What do people of Guanzhong call it when a torn garment is mended?"*

Lai Lingyu answered:
*"They call it *zhexi*—folding and washing."*

The Master said:
*"The Daoist teachings here have grown tattered and broken—
I must mend them."*

Before half a month had passed, an imperial edict arrived, ordering Daoist priests to return to their native regions. The Master then departed the pass.

Master Changchun Qiu was then in Longshan. One day, he said to Li Daxiong:
*"The Dao here is bound. Though I am listed in the edict, I cannot leave the pass. If I were to leave, the Daoist winds of Qin would be swept clean away."*

He descended the mountain with the green robes, and the officials and people of the prefecture jointly petitioned to retain him. He returned to his mountain dwelling.

After the Master left the pass, wherever he went, the villagers wore their hair in topknots and donned white, singing and dancing in the streets. As he approached, they flocked to greet him like phoenixes and auspicious stars, vying to catch a glimpse of him.

Upon returning to his native village, he met the butcher Liu Qing and instructed him: *"In the past, when you asked me about the verse on the wall, twenty years had already passed unnoticed—counting by the day, you slaughter three beasts daily, and even ten thousand would be insufficient. How much more so for you, a man of eighty-three winters, with a vast lineage and noble family? It is only right to cease killing."*

The man then awoke to reason and chose a day to hold a vegetarian feast, carrying his chopping block and utensils to the city gate to burn them.

That day, he visited the Golden Lotus Hall, where the six flavors—bitter, sour, salty, and the rest—were unfit for offering. The Master stood by the well and struck it with his foot; the water became sweet as *li* spring, and the county folk called it the "Numinous Elixir." They built a pavilion and erected a stele, spreading the tale far and wide.

In the year *Rén-Yín* (壬寅), the fifth month, a great drought struck Shùmòu, withering the young crops. The people implored the rivers and mountains in vain, but when the prefectural and county officials respectfully invited the Master, hoping for even a drop of his virtue, a single incense’s worth of warmth arose, and a downpour of nourishing rain fell.

By the seventh month of autumn, the county folk held a grand *jiào* ritual at the Cháoyuán Observatory. Days of gloomy rain left the laity and Daoists in dismay, fearing the altar would be ruined. The Master said, *"Fear not—today will surely clear."* And so it was.

When the time came to burn the *wén* scriptures at the Mid-Autumn Festival, five clouds coiled about the sky, and cranes and phoenixes lingered in the air. Such was the swiftness of his response.

In mid-winter, as he passed through Dēngzhou, the devotee Hàn Gōng burned incense and prayed: *"My family’s well is bitter—if only you would deign to lend your power, perhaps its taste might change."* The Master went and chanted over it, and instantly the water turned sweet as honey.

As evening fell and rain began, he stayed overnight at Hàn’s residence. In jest, he wrote:
*"Outside the gate, the rain patters—*
*Heaven keeps the guest, but not the host.*
*My lord may yet endure,*
*But smash the Daoist’s skull!"*

None understood the last line until Master Kāngzhēn came to inquire, when suddenly a tile from the eaves fell and struck him squarely on the head. Only then did the crowd grasp the meaning of the final verse.

On the Double Ninth Festival, after the *jiào* ritual concluded, the Celestial Gate opened in the southwest, and auspicious clouds gathered at the moon’s edge. The county folk could not help but bow in reverence.

On the eighth day of the second month, the Master urged the villagers of Lángyá in Shùmòu to burn all their fishing nets and boats. The wind shifted, the snow melted, and suddenly, a towering emerald peak appeared—a marvel that stunned all, for it was the *hǎishì* (sea-market illusion) manifesting in Nányáng.

In the year *Guǐmǎo* (癸卯), on the thirteenth day of the fourth month, as the Master conducted a *jiào* ritual in Zhīyáng, a violent storm arose. The crowd lamented, hoping for clear skies. The Master clenched his teeth and stared vacantly, as if in prayer. Soon, the clouds dispersed and the sun emerged.

In the afternoon of the fifteenth, a dragon’s tail appeared in the southwest, lingering for some time before vanishing. That night, colored clouds pierced the moon.

On the twenty-eighth of the fourth month, as he traveled to Zhīyáng, the *hǎishì* reappeared, visible from dawn until noon.

When the Master reached the Huíguāng Hermitage, Mǎ Cóngshì joyfully offered to burn a thousand *hú* of grain certificates in repayment. Later, Jūfù gathered fishing nets to burn them, and the *hǎishì* reappeared, faintly resembling a dragon carriage and crane-drawn chariot. Two others, Guō Hēng and Lè Zhōu, also gathered nets to burn, and suddenly, the island of Sāng appeared between them, with battle formations arrayed in shifting ranks—like the array of divine soldiers and armored cavalry.

While residing in Huátíng’s humble abode, a *línzhēn* tree stood withered and dead, its branches brittle, its heart rotten, ready to be felled for firewood. On the ninth day of the fourth month, the Master watered it, and soon afterward, his disciple Yáo Xuān arrived with the *jiāpǔ* of Pure Yang True Person. It was then revealed that the tree had been planted on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, when Pure Yang True Person was born beneath it. The Master smiled: *"I was born on the twentieth of the fifth month—by now, its leaves and branches should have sprouted."* He composed a verse:

*"Thirty-six above, thirty-six below,*
*Heaven and Earth enter the Treasure Vase,*
*Seventy-two *hòu* complete the measure."*

Li Gōng knelt and begged for an explanation, but the Master laughed: *"This is a hidden saying—you will understand it in time."*

On the seventeenth of the fifth month, Li Gōng dreamed that the *línzhēn* tree sprouted two leaves on either side. When he awoke and examined it, new shoots had indeed taken root.

By the time of the Master’s birthday celebration, the branches had grown thick with green shade. Only then did he explain the verse: *"Four nines make thirty-six days; Heaven and Earth combine for seventy-two days—when *qi* and climate are full, how could decay not turn to flourishing?"*

At the Quánzhēn Hermitage, two clumps of bamboo and a pine were transplanted in the fourth month, their leaves withered and yellow. Daoist friend Cuī Gōng asked the Master if they might revive. The Master cheerfully composed two poems:

*"The Daoist’s gate is called ‘Long Life,’*
*Yet seeks to reverse decay’s design.*
*Let these few stalks forever stay green,*
*No leaf shall dare turn pale or lean."*

And again:

*"I master the Law of Life’s rotation,*
*Shifting *qi* to transform the frame.*
*Not just the scholar’s bamboo stays green,*
*Now even the minister’s pine regains its prime."*

He then watered them with his face-washing water, and within a decade, new shoots emerged, their hearts unfolding into leaves.

At the Jīnyù Hermitage, six small pines were planted on the third day of the sixth month. The crowd knelt and said: *"The pine and bamboo of Quánzhēn Hermitage have revived—why do these six young pines of Jīnyù wither so?"*

The Master then infused them with his true *qi* three times, composing three short poems:

*"Six pines planted in June’s heat,*
*Yet return to life like spring’s breeze.*
*Though my breath is scant, my will is strong—*
*Six wishes fulfilled, great merit earned."*

And again:

*"In past summers, pines were planted,*
*Daoist friends tested the wind’s might.*
*I said six would not take root,*
*Yet fame spreads of the Three-Tufted’s might."*

*"Six pines planted on the third of June,*
*Their colors changed by the wind’s breath.*
*I borrow the Double Ninth’s *qi* to pray,*
*As legend says, the Three-Tufted’s power holds sway."*

The pines did not alter branch or leaf, their verdure lovely beyond compare. The villagers then carved his poems onto stone.

Long ago, Lü Dongbin revived a withered sophora tree in Lái zhōu’s Longxīng Temple with a single pill and a poem, which still stands today. His verse reads:

*"Long sleeves trailing from my river-bank retreat,*
*Night lodged in the ancient hall of the *zhī* temple."*

The city without night preserves the saint’s trace,
Yet bids the old sophora endure a thousand winters.

Now the Master revives the Six Pines of Zhiyang with three verses—
Before and after the sages, their essence is one.

A poor scholar of Zhiyang, both feet crippled,
Cried out in pain one day—
The Master sighed, gave him water to drink,
And when he finished, his steps flew like the wind.

A man from Lewu, long afflicted by wind-damp,
Found no cure in a hundred medicines—
The Master gave him a pill, and in a day, he was fully healed.

One day, the Master suddenly sang and danced in joy,
His disciples hurried in: *"On the last day of the twelfth month,
In the year of the Male Ox, Sun Xianjiu passed away in Henan,
At sixty-four years of age."*

The Master said: *"Last night, I rode the colored clouds,
Heard celestial music, and returned to the Eastern Sea—
I saw her myself.
My dancing was for this—
I had known it beforehand."*

That year, in the ninth month,
At the *Kunjian Qiyue An*, he presided over the *Guohun* ritual,
With auspicious mists shimmering, cranes and phoenixes coming and going—
Too many to count.

In *Shu* Mountain, he built the Seven-Treasure Hermitage,
Dug a well nine *chi* deep but found no spring—
A great stone blocked the way.
The Master inscribed:
*"Dig deeper still to the Double Nine’s depth,*
*The sweet spring will surely answer the pure call."*

Workmen were ordered to dig again, down to eighteen *chi*,
And cold water gushed forth.

A Seven-Treasure Hermitage oxcart carried a massive *liang* tree,
Over treacherous paths—
The driver nearly collapsed in the traces,
His chest heaving, his breath ragged—
Yet when he chanted the *Danyang* name,
He suffered no harm.

In the third month of the year of the Male Ox,
He rested at the *Shun* Temple in Jinan—
Old and young alike vied to pay homage,
Thousands crowding in at the gates,
Breaking off the door’s hinges.

Standing tall and unharmed,
In the twelfth month, he transplanted two *wú* trees—tall as several *rén*—
Planted in the Seven-Treasure Hermitage, they withered with time.
The Master first struck them with true *qi*, then breathed upon them,
And with water poured over them, in ten days’ time their verdant hue returned.

On the *Xiàyuán* day, Master Wénshān presided over the *jiào* rites,
Yet days of unbroken rain had the crowd in dismay.
The Master heard a voice from the void say:
*"The Reborn-on-Double-Nine Immortal arrives."*
Maolai and Ergong stood nearby and heard it too.

On the sixteenth day, at the *bǔ* hour,
Countess Ní Lì Gǔ Wǔ Jié gazed upward—
A celestial figure in green headband and white robes appeared,
Seated upon a white *pí* and lotus leaf of emerald hue,
The tortoise beneath him swayed its tail.
Old Hundred-Longevity exclaimed:
*"This is the painted Lord from the scroll!"*
Hastily, incense and offerings were prepared—all paid homage.
Suddenly, the Immortal turned and reclined, vanishing southward.

The Master composed *"Mǎn Tíng Fāng"* to record the event,
And the townsfolk carved it upon stone.

Láiyáng invited the Master to the *Yóuxiān Guān* to discuss the *jiào* rites.
In mid-December, the Master replied:
*"We shall meet again in three days."*

On the twenty-second day, at the hour of Reborn-on-Double-Nine’s descent,
The Master commanded Zhīyī to dance *"Guīcháo Huān."*
Gazing upward, he saw the Reborn-on-Double-Nine Master and Hé Gōng’s teacher
Ascending slowly through the air.
The Master said:
*"Majestic return to the Dao—be a joyous immortal!"*
And again:
*"At the peak of grandeur, why not depart with a sweep of the sleeve?"*
He called his disciple Liú Zhēnyī and said:
*"If you wish to become immortals, it is not so simple.
When faced with trials, do not falter—be ever more cautious,
And only then may you attain it.
Take these words to heart and never forget."*

Then he bound his hair and, facing outward, told the disciples:
*"With eyes open, I see; with eyes closed, I see.
Seeing is not in the eyes—when the heart is clear, all is seen."*

Conversing with his disciples, as the second watch neared,
A storm raged—thunder cracked, and the Master’s body ascended in flight.

Guō Fùzhōng, the wine-tax supervisor, heard frantic knocking at the gate.
He went out to see—it was the Master.
He led him inside to converse, then asked for paper to write a verse:
*"Sixty-one years on earth, unrecognized by all,
A sudden clap of thunder—soaring with the wind’s call."*

After some time, he took leave and departed swiftly.
A villager named Liú Xí saw, that night, light in the house’s cracks,
Like a lamp’s glow. At dawn, he found a scroll—
Taken down with a bamboo pole—four lines of verse:
*"The Three Yang gather to fulfill the Rounded Work,
The Wind-Horse rides the wind—now an immortal made.
I urge you to subdue the Dragon and Tiger,
And naturally ascend to heaven’s share."*

Later, he inscribed the Master’s posthumous name.
He hurried to burn it, and the scent of *dùnjiān* filled the house.
Soon, word came:
*"Last night, the Master ascended."*

Only then did Guō Fùzhōng and Liú Xí realize they had seen his *yángshén*.

Seven days passed before his form appeared serene.
He was buried at the *Yóuxiān Guān*.

Earlier, the *Shùhuá* Hermitage had tens of pines,
Their branches and leaves all turned white.
The Master said:
*"This white pine—perhaps it is for me."*

On the eighteenth day of the first month, *jiǎchén* year,
Scholar-official Liú Shàozǔ and others saw in the sky
*Luánhè* circling, clouds shifting—
The Reborn-on-Double-Nine Immortal in cloud-crown and crimson robes,
And Dan’yáng Master in three-topknot white garb,
Manifesting above the clouds before departing after some time.

On the twelfth day of the fifth month, *jǐhài* evening,
The Master suddenly appeared northwest of the *Yìngxiān Qiáo*,
With celestial attendants beside him.
Soon, cold clouds obscured him—
At the time, Yú Xìn and twenty others witnessed it.

After the Master’s burial, the townsfolk suspected
That Shǎnxī disciples had stolen his immortal remains.
Until the twenty-fourth day of the first month, *yǐsǐ* year,
County Magistrate Liú had the coffin opened—
His features lived on, his limbs supple.
He was reattired and combed, and pilgrims flocked from afar,
Their footsteps unending.

By the ninth month, he was reburied in a stone coffin.
His works—*Fēnlí Shíhuà*, *Jiànwù*, *Jīngwēi*, *Zhāiwēi*,
*Sānbǎo*, *Xínghuà*, *Jīnyù*—were published.
Their meaning penetrates the Three Teachings,
Embraces the Five Phases,
Responds to past and present,
Uses objects to instruct,
Discusses profound truths—
As if the Penglai Isles stood before one’s eyes.
With wisdom’s blade and insight’s sword,
He banished the Three Corpses beyond the body,
And following him leads to virtue, far from guilt.
Understanding him grants sainthood, transcending humanity—
How could this be of little benefit?

**Praise:**
First encountering Reborn-on-Double-Nine,
Clarifying the Nine Transformations,
Ten stages of dividing the pear—
Secretly transmitting hints,
Six returns bestowing yams—
Hidden mechanisms unfold.
Piercing the Jade Gate before *yuanqi*’s birth,
Pointing beyond the Five Phases’ reach,
Opening the Golden Door, entering the Metal Gate,
Gathering sun and moon within the jar,
Concentrating clouds and mists in the cauldron.
Unfurling half the state’s bounty,
Crowning the three-topknot’s measure—
Decades of snow-sleep, frost-dream,
Ten thousand miles of mountain-crossing, water-wading,
Seven golden lotuses blooming first and fully,
Five secret discourses passed alone.
A thunderclap—fulfilling the red-cloud vow,
For countless eons in green, returning to blue’s play.

He awakened the Perfect Truth,
Expanded the Mysterious Teaching.

Zhang Shén’tóng’s poem:
*"The foremost scholar of the Eastern Sea,
Reborn-on-Double-Nine once lifted him from drunkenness.
How many past and present cultivators
Pale in comparison to this Master?"*

**Record of the Golden Lotus Orthodoxy, Volume Three, Complete.**
*#1: The original character "止" was changed to "上" based on the Jíyào edition.*

Longzhēn Tán Zhēnrén—
The Master, surnamed Tán, given name Yù, courtesy name Bóyù, was his ancestral name, residing in Nínghǎi.
A man of bold generosity, his wisdom and discernment were extraordinary; filial piety and righteousness passed down in his family, highly esteemed by the neighborhood.
In the winter of Dīnghài in the Dàdìng era, he suffered from vertigo and paralysis, lingering without relief. Though he consumed many medicines, none took effect.
Hearing of Zhòngyáng Master arriving from Zhōngnán, he, still staying idly at Mǎ Jūn’s residence in Yífǔ, leaned on his cane and went to pay respects, seeking healing methods.
The Master refused to admit him at the door, yet he persisted, knocking and calling all night without pause. Suddenly, the door opened on its own.
Zhòngyáng Master rejoiced greatly, deeming him a soul bound by Daoist affinity, and thus invited him to share his bed with Cluán Zhì.
They conversed intimately beyond that of old friends. By dawn, his former ailments vanished entirely—his limbs light and nimble, he moved like the wind, only then realizing Zhòngyáng Master’s extraordinary nature.
He abandoned wealth and gold as if they were filth, begging to serve at the Master’s side for life without retreat. The Master bestowed upon him a Daoist name: Chǔduān, a courtesy name of Tōngzhèng, and the title of Chángzhēn Zǐ.
He gifted a poem:
*"Beyond the Pass of Yin-Yang Creation,
A single heart toward Dao, never turning back.
The Pure Way of the Vermilion Court is truly the path of the Immortal,
Only settle and cultivate the inner radiance."*

Once the Master received his teachings, he extinguished the self and worldly attachments, abandoned all thoughts, wore a green headband, and donned coarse linen robes.
In the year Wùzǐ of the Dàdìng era, he bade farewell to relatives and neighbors, following his Master’s side, and journeyed south to Biāngliáng.
He attended morning and evening, gaining much of the Mysterious Dao’s essence.
By the third year, his Master ascended to the Celestial Court upon the clouds, and he returned west to Liú Jiāng with the Master’s remains, burying them with proper rites.
Afterward, he withdrew to the region between Yī and Luò, refining his spirit and cultivating his *qi*.
Though he lingered in places of old red roads and purple paths, flower-lined groves, and wine-soaked battlefields, his heart remained as motionless as earth and wood.
Not even ten thousand taels of gold could make him bend his waist.
He drifted until reaching Shuǐnán’s Celestial Court Palace, where Lǎngrán Zǐ had refined his elixir.
Thus, he cherished the place and never left.
Later, when crowds gathered at the gate, he alone begged for food without cease.
Once passing through Zhāotí, he sought remnants of food from a Zen master, who flew into a rage and struck him with a fist, breaking two teeth.
The Master swallowed the blood with composure, while onlookers sought to intervene—yet he smiled and bowed, utterly unmoved.
From then on, his fame spread through Jīngluò.

He had always loved the characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**, practicing their forms tirelessly until his brushwork reached a divine state,
as if the strokes themselves could soar and transform.
Devoted Daoist disciples collected and treasured them as precious relics.
Later, when a fire consumed his estate and spread to a hundred households, only those who kept these two characters remained unharmed.

One day, he instructed his disciples:
*"Zhòngyáng Master and I have a pact with Pénglái—now he departs!"*
As he spoke, five-colored auspicious clouds swirled around the courtyard, and green cranes and white storks soared in and out.
Then, he bound his hair and faced south, resting his arm as a pillow, and shed his mortal frame on the first day of the fourth month.

His secular songs and compositions numbered nearly hundreds, titled *Shuǐyún*—
deeply mastering the Dao of **铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)**, and the **沂 (Yí) River’s flow**.
He practiced widely in the world.

The eulogy says:
*"The aged Daoist Immortal of Longzhēn,
A bold warrior of Nínghǎi,
Shared studies with the Three-Topknot Master,
And knelt before Zhòngyáng to receive his oath.
One night’s conversation left unfinished,
A decade’s madness instantly cured.
He scorned a thousand gold pieces,
And hung his hundred *nà* robes with glad poverty.
Refining *qi* and calming spirit,
He wandered for years beneath Luò’s skies,
Returning to his roots and fulfilling his destiny—
Half his life spent never crossing back to Shāndōng.
Taming a hundred demons with hidden form,
The two characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**—
Seizing the Two Principles in his grasp,
The Nine Return of Dragon and Tiger.
Just as the fragrant osmanthus bloomed,
And the golden lotus shone resplendent.
**铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)** inscribed in the *Shuǐyún* collection,
Smoke and mist as his playful retreat in Pénghuái.
If not for bones and flesh ascending together,
And form and spirit both attaining transcendence—
Who could match this Master?"*

Zhang Shéntóng’s poem:
*"A heart of iron against wind and fire,
A true hero who embraces the Dao’s return.
In spring’s warmth, his spirit wanders in Luòyáng,
Still holding the **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)** talismans in the north.
The Master of True Longevity, Liú Zhēnrén—
A descendant of the Eastern Sea’s golden lineage,
A remnant of the Han’s illustrious virtue,
Graceful as clouds, majestic as peaks,
Noble as the essence of Yùe’s mountains,
Vast as the lakes—his depth and brilliance cannot be contained by stars or constellations.
His ancestors and forefathers dwelled in Wǔguān,
Cherishing hidden virtue, delighting in bestowing kindness,
Relieving the cold and hungry, benefiting orphans and the aged,
Donating eighty acres of fertile land to Lóngxīng’s grand monastery,
As the eternal root for nurturing blessings.
In the era of Tàipíng Xīngguó,
The court praised his filial piety and righteousness,
Honoring his family with banners,
Exempting them from taxes and levies—
His virtue shone across neighboring counties.
Heaven did not forsake the virtuous—
From the Vermilion Cloud and Golden Landscape,
It selected his refined immortal essence,
And bestowed auspicious signs upon Yèchéng.
Though he stood apart from the world,
He reverently served his widowed mother,
Renowned for his filial devotion,
Swearing never to wed or seek office,
Disdaining fame and wealth,
Guarding his purity like a simpleton,
The affairs of the world could not shake his steadfast sincerity.
He repeatedly declined his ancestral home,
Aspiring to seek the extraordinary—
Yet his compassionate mother’s longing held him back.
In the spring of Jǐchǒu in the Dàdìng era,
He suddenly saw two verses inscribed on his neighbor’s wall—
In places no one else could reach—
The ink still fresh, no name left behind.
The final lines read:
*'In Wǔguān, the land of True Nature’s cultivation,
There must be one who achieves immortal longevity without death.'*
The Master delighted in the bold and forceful strokes,
Suspecting they were the work of a divine being,
Yet he could not confirm their meaning.
That autumn, in the ninth month,
With frost and dew in the air,
Zhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,
Journeyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—
Tán, Liú, and Mǎ—
Crossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.
The Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,
Offering incense and fire to welcome him.
Zhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:
*'Do you recognize the ink on the wall?'*"

In the Year of the Ox, suddenly within the neighbor’s wall—
Where none else could reach—
He saw two bold verses freshly inked,
No name left behind,
Their closing lines declaring:
*"In Wǔguān, the land of True Nature’s cultivation,
There must be one who achieves immortal longevity without death."*

The Master marveled at their forceful strokes,
Suspecting they were the work of a divine being,
Yet could not verify their meaning.

That autumn, in the ninth month,
With frost and dew in the air,
Zhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,
Journeyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—
Tán, Liú, and Mǎ—
Crossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.
The Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,
Offering incense and fire to welcome him.
Zhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:
*"Do you recognize the ink on the wall?"*

The three disciples also exchanged glances and chilly smiles,
Then realized the verses were divine manifestations meant to startle them.
They thus carved their sincerity into their very bones,
Pledged their loyalty with unyielding resolve,
Carrying their stools and staffs,
Holding their towels and bottles,
Obeying his every command,
Letting life and death follow his will.
The Master, moved by their earnestness,
Admired their single-minded dedication,
And their extraordinary aura beyond mortal kind,
Exclaimed with a sigh:
*"In the month of pine, beneath the snow of bamboo,
I have no need for the yellow dust of the world."*

He composed a poem in reply:
*"After casting my line, I return to see the tortoise,
Now knowing my fate—ranked among the celestial Immortals.*
*The crane and the fish call to each other, understanding my intent,
Rising from the waves a thousand feet high.*
*Taking the verses’ meaning to heart,
I name ‘Longevity’ as my title,
‘Mystic’ as my surname,
‘Penetrating Marvel’ as my given character—*
*At the time, I was but a year past my twentieth spring.*
*The names of Qióu, Liú, Tán, and Mǎ filled the Nine Wilds and Eight Strings,*
*Traveling in Biānlíng, dwelling at Yímén,*
*Begging for alms to refine my form,*
*Hiding my true name in obscurity,*
*Knocking at dawn, pleading at dusk,*
*Sitting in steaming incense, walking in perfumed smoke,*
*Skillfully unraveling the profound mysteries,*
*Diligently expounding the sacred texts,*
*Clearing away illusions like clouds,*
*Dispelling delusions like mist.*

*The Master, having fully imparted the Four Symbols and Five Elements,*
*Then departed, leaving his mortal vessel behind,*
*Retreating into heaven—*
*As the saying goes: ‘Finding a true friend, he ascends to Pénglái.’*
*The four disciples carried their Immortal bodies,*
*Repaying his boundless grace,*
*Knocking at Xiànyáng, passing through Huáyīn,*
*Calming their spirits in the radiant glow of Liú Jiāng’s former hall.*
*Though each had different aspirations,*
*The Master alone concealed his traces in Luòjīng,*
*Refined his nature amid the dust of the world,*
*Nurtured his purity in the chaotic hum of the marketplace,*
*Where neither music nor flowers could distract his harmony,*
*Nor the pleasures of life perturb his clarity.*
*His heart grew colder with each passing day,*
*His body stilled like wood in winter.*

*When others worked, he ate without complaint,*
*When none asked, his face remained unruffled,*
*When questioned, he answered with a gesture,*
*When left alone, his silence was absolute.*
*His willpower was flawless,*
*His inner light radiant as heaven.*
*He then moved to the banks of Yúnxī,*
*And his disciples carved a cave dwelling into the rocky slopes.*
*Suddenly, he encountered an ancient well with cold, clear water,*
*The crowd astonished by its strangeness,*
*The Master laughing said:*
*'Just a few steps away, there are two more wells—*
*They are the places where I cultivated in past lives.'*
*When dug, they were indeed found,*
*And to this day, the cave is called the ‘Three Wells.’*

*In the Year of the Ram (Dìngshēn),*
*He returned to Wǔguān,*
*To pay respects to his mother,*
*Their reunion filled with joy.*
*He chose a site beneath the shadow of Tàojī,*
*And built the Hall of Lingxū,*
*Planting cypress trees with his own hands,*
*Their verdant rows stretching into the distance.*
*Soon after, the local villagers falsely accused him of murder,*
*And he went without protest to be bound.*
*He endured the slander of the fox-trapers for nearly ten weeks.*

*Pure Yang Master, hearing the water clock,*
*Riding the Azure Unicorn,*
*Descending from the Azure Sky,*
*Entering the Mystic Realm,*
*Meeting at Liǔwěi,*
*Commissioned him to study under Guǎnchéng,*
*And taught him the art of calligraphy.*
*Later, the murderer confessed himself,*
*And the Master was spared the punishment of imprisonment.*

*When he emerged,*
*His brushwork was divine,*
*With dragons and serpents leaping from the ink.*
*In the Year of the Great Peace (Dàdìng),*
*He presided over the grand ritual at Chāngyáng,*
*Where colorful clouds veiled the altar,*
*And white cranes danced in the courtyard.*
*That year, the autumn drought scorched the land,*
*Yet he earnestly prayed for rain.*
*Standing upon the ritual platform,*
*He looked around and saw no clouds,*
*Then said:*
*'By the hour of the cock tomorrow,*
*There will be sweet, heavy rain as if from a flood.'*
*His words proved true,*
*Like echoes responding to sound and form.*

*Afterward, whenever he led the grand rituals in Shùzhōu,*
*There was always a blessed wind that swirled,*
*Rising to carry the paper offerings aloft,*
*His influence as divine as the heavens,*
*To this day, the stone inscriptions remain in every district.*

*In the third year of Chéng’ān,*
*The Emperor Zhāng heard of his Dao’s worth,*
*And sent envoys to summon him,*
*With a tortoise-shaped boat and a reed mat,*
*To escort him to the Purple Palace,*
*Treating him as a honored guest,*
*Granting him the surname ‘Lín’*
*And the name ‘Xiūzhēn.’*
*The officials and commoners came in endless procession,*
*His doorstep never empty.*

*The following spring, in the third month,*
*He begged to return to his native mountain,*
*The Emperor, unable to refuse,*
*Bestowed the title ‘Língxū’*
*And honored his ancestral hall.*

*On the auspicious day of the sixth month,*
*In the Year of the Ox (Gǔihài),*
*Drums were beaten and the crowd gathered,*
*And he announced his journey to the Board of Literature.*
*Leaning on his left arm,*
*He returned to True Nature,*
*His radiance enveloping the heavens,*
*His sacred qi swirling in auspicious patterns.*
*All his remaining works—*
*The ‘Music of the Immortals,’ ‘Great Void,’ ‘Swirling Yang,’ ‘Mingling with Dust,’ ‘Serene Ease,’ ‘Perfecting the True’—*
*Still expound the ‘Dao Dé,’*
*Interpret the ‘Yīnfú,’*
*And elucidate the ‘Huángtíng.’*
*His insights delve into the depths of truth,*
*His teachings reveal the sacred essence,*
*Sufficient as a guide for all ages to come.*

*The praise reads:*
*"The Old Immortal of Longevity,
Proclaims the transformation of authority,
Swallows the Void, spits out Nature,
Riding the purple clouds to descend and wander—
At the edge of the Azure Sea,
Meeting the cosmic cycle of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch,
Binding with Pure Yang across countless kalpas.*
*He strikes the hundred barriers,*
*Pierces the Nine Abysses,*
*Drives the Four Beasts,*
*Tills the Three Fields,*
*Sits in the marketplace of Luòyáng,*
*Carves out the Celestial Cavern of Yúnxī.*
*Melting white snow into powder,*
*Refining black frost without smoke.*
*His fame resounds in Fèngzhōu,*
*His glory shines in Jīnlián.*
*He builds the hall of Linglú,*
*Bows to the imperial edict,*
*And then settles the ancient debt of Shù-Lài,*
*Only then do flesh and spirit reunite,*
*Feasting and reveling in the Eight Extremes."*

*Zhāng Shéntóng’s poem reads:*
*"Deep within the Penglai peaks, the truth is revealed,
A single spark of clarity piercing the dust.*
*After ascending beyond the winds of Shù,*
*Lingxū quietly seals the spring in its jade hall."*

---

**Long Spring Qióu Zhēnren**
Zhēnren’s surname was Qióu, given name Chǔjī.
He was called **Long Spring Child**.
His family lineage traced back to Qīxiá,
Where they were most distinguished.

By nature, he was quick and had a prodigious memory,
His learning vast and his talent extraordinary.

The brow and countenance serene and unconstrained,
Every gesture and bearing refined and deliberate,
Those skilled in physiognomy declared: *"Your honor bears tortoise markings—
You shall surely become the sage of emperors and kings."*

Before reaching his minority, he ardently emulated the **Daoist currents**,
Discussing nothing but the **Way of Eternal Life and Long Vision**,
Singing nothing but the **soaring phoenix and winged dragon** of transcendence.

In the spring of **Dàdìng** year **Dīnghài**,
He heard of **Chóngyáng** in **Kūnjiàn Mountain’s** *Yānxīá Cave*,
And with eager steps, he sought him out.
Clad in coarse robes, he knelt to receive instruction.

**Chóngyáng**, seeing him, took delight,
And spoke with him through the night—
Their **Daoist insights** harmonized,
Thus he gifted him this verse:

*"Fine scales gleam like gold in emerald waters,
Seeking fragrant bait to swallow the hook with ease.
Granted leisure to wind my silken thread,
Drawn into Penglai’s boundless freedom forever."*

The Master bowed in reverence and accepted it,
Serving at his side day and night,
Content to take on menial tasks,
Following his teacher through mountains and seas,
Southward to **Biànliáng**,
As time passed, his resolve grew ever steadier,
His bond with the teacher surpassing even **glue and lacquer**,
And his **Daoist enlightenment** deepened with each revelation.

One day, an elder teacher called him to the **Penglai gathering**,
And he departed, leaving all behind—
Ascending to the **Heavenly Dao** itself.
After the grand funeral rites concluded,
He journeyed westward to **Fèngxiáng**,
Begging food at **Tàigōng’s** fishing spot by **Wènduān Creek**,
Conquering slumber, dispelling stray thoughts,
For seven years, his face never touched a cushion,
A single **waterproof cloak and hat**,
Unchanged through scorching heat and biting cold—
Men named him the **Cloak-Hat Master**,
In perfect accord with **emptiness**, his understanding penetrating **Daoist profundity**.

He returned to **Liú-Jiāng**,
Considering it the old retreat of his teacher,
Reluctant to leave, unable to depart.

In the spring of **Dàdìng** year **Wùshēn**, the **Second Month**,
The **Emperor** heard of his name and sent envoys to summon him to court.
The gifts bestowed were lavish,
And he was appointed to dwell at **Tiāncháng Guān**.
In time, he was entrusted to conduct the **Jiézhǔ ritual** for the **Effigy Master**.

On the first day of the **Fourth Month**,
By imperial decree, he was appointed **Superintendent of the Quánzhēn Hall**,
And the emperor himself inscribed the **sealed character plaque** above it.

On the **First Day of the Fifth Month**, he was summoned to **Chángsōng Island**,
And again on the **Tenth Day of the Seventh Month**,
Where he expounded on the **principles of Heaven and humanity**,
Elucidating the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of the **Quánzhēn tradition**,
Deeply pleasing the imperial will.

In response to the imperial command, he presented the *Sutra of the First Layer of Yáotai*:
*"When the **Celestial Dragon’s treasure** takes flight,*
*And all spirits of the **Four Seas** gather in homage,*
*"The myriad affairs of governance grow tranquil,*
*The **Three Pure Ones*** harmonize in counsel—
*No spears or banners are raised.*

*Jade towers and golden halls stretch wide,*
*Moon platforms and wind pavilions overlook the pool.*
*In stillness, the **Way of Non-action*** prevails,
*Gliding in painted boats,*
*Rowing past the **cooling mats** and **chess tables** at dusk.*

*Only when the **former sage*** establishes his **auspicious work***
Does **Great Peace** truly manifest—
*The **Dao** is rare, the gathering hard to meet.*

*When **Heaven’s aid** arrives,*
*The distant wilds pay tribute,*
*The **Mysterious Teaching*** dispels confusion.
*Sitting in court, he listens with grace,*
*In leisure, he accompanies **Red Pine**,*
*Discussing **rare and lofty** matters.*

*Exceeding even the swiftest steeds,*
*He turns to ask humanity of **one degree**—*
*Beyond the mortal realm, he returns to **emptiness**.*"

The emperor, upon reading it, rejoiced greatly,
And at twilight, spoke of his return.

The following day, the imperial envoy presented a tray of peaches. The Master had abstained from tea and fruit for over ten years, yet out of the emperor’s boundless grace, he reluctantly ate one.

By the Mid-Autumn Festival, he received the edict to return to the mountains, and was further granted ten thousand strings of cash, which he respectfully declined.

In the year *Jiǎyǒu*, the second month, the imperial carriage departed from Yàn Tái. Upon reaching the *Guān Shǎn* region, news of the emperor’s passing arrived. The Master sighed and said: *"Alas! The great matter of life and death—though one holds the highest rank, possesses all under Heaven, yet cannot escape the hundred years’ span. How is this possible?"* Thus, he resolved to return westward.

Crossing *Hán Gǔ Pass*, passing through *Zhōngnán Mountains*, he traveled according to local customs, spreading the *Mysterious Teaching*, which flourished wherever he went.

When the era was renamed *Míngchāng*, he returned eastward to the seaside, taking refuge at Qíxiá, where he constructed altars and halls.

By the year *Wùchén*, his reputation soared, his name known throughout the land. The emperor honored him, renaming his abode *Tàixū Guān* and bestowing six thousand volumes of *Xuándū Bǎozàng* as perpetual offerings.

Not long after, war raged across the *Héshuò* frontier. Envoys from Sòng and Jin, each bearing imperial decrees, arrived simultaneously. The Great Mongols of the northern lands also sent *Liú Zhònglù* with their own proclamation. All assumed the Master would journey south, for the southern lands revered the *Way* deeply, while the north was steeped in slaughter—besides, the languages were incomprehensible.

Yet the Master said nothing. He selected eighteen disciples worthy of the journey and, with *Liú Zhònglù*, set westward.

Passing through *Jì*, reaching *Déyù Fǔ*, he lodged at *Lóngyáng Guān*. He sent a poem to his friends in Yànjīng:

*"Ten years of war and fire bring sorrow to the people,*
*Yet scarcely one or two survive a thousand.*
*Last year, by fortune, I received the merciful edict,*
*This spring, I must brave the cold to depart.*
*I do not shun the three thousand *lǐ* of northern peaks,*
*Yet still I ponder the two hundred eastern prefectures.*
*In dire straits, the condemned gasp for breath—*
*Let me teach them how to ease their woes."*

Crossing the *Bái Gǔ Tián*, where cold winds and piled snow bit into the bones, he endured countless hardships. He composed a long poem in ancient style to record their journey:

*"East of Jīnshān, west of Yīnshān,*
*Ten thousand cliffs and gorges pierce the deep ravines.*
*Chaotic rocks block the path beyond,*
*No wheel or hoof has ever passed since ancient times.*
*Two years past, the Second Prince raised armies,*
*Built bridges to span the rushing waters.*
*Now my *Way* seeks to journey westward,*
*Again the clamor of chariots and horses passes here.*
*Silver peaks, iron walls rise ten thousandfold,*
*Each vying in grandeur, boasting of their might.*
*When the sun rises, the sea below seems near,*
*When the moon shines, it connects with the Milky Way.*
*Heaven-piercing pines stand straight as writing brushes,*
*Towering, swaying—over a hundred *zhàng* tall.*
*Ten thousand stalks lean close, dark and dense,*
*Yet not a crow caws—only empty silence.*
*The winding *Yángqiāng* presses *Mèngmén* against *Tàiháng*,
*Yet this mountain’s grandeur is still but commonplace.*
*Double chariots climb and descend with labored steps,*
*Hundreds of horsemen before and behind, all in alarm.*
*The *Tiānchí* sea lies atop the mountain,*
*A hundred *lǐ* mirroring the boundless world.*
*Cars halt, horses descend the western slope,*
*Forty-eight bridges stretch low over ten thousand *zhàng*.*
*From the southern river to the northern sea, the mountains are endless,*
*In endless change, their forms remain the same.*
*Yet none compare to this mountain’s supreme oddity—*
*Its rugged, towering peaks seem wrought by divine craft.*
*When I arrived, it was the eighth or ninth month,*
*Yet half the mountain was already snow.*
*Before the mountain, grass and trees warm as spring,*
*Behind it, my robes stiffen like iron.*
*Westward, I traveled ten thousand *lǐ*—*
*The mountains, rivers, strange men, and marvelous beasts*
*I saw were far different from those of the Central Kingdom.*

At that time, *Chéngjísī* the Emperor still held *Suàn Dān*, not yet descending. The envoy *Liú Zhònglù* presented the Master to him. The Emperor greeted him warmly: *"Other kingdoms’ summons go unanswered, yet you have crossed ten thousand *lǐ* to come here. I greatly honor this."*

The Master replied: *"The mountains and wilderness rise in response to the imperial edict—this is the will of Heaven, not the work of man."*

The Emperor offered him food. After eating, he asked: *"Master, having traveled so far, do you possess any elixir of longevity to bestow upon me?"*

The Master said: *"I have only the *Way* of preserving life, not an elixir of immortality."*

The Emperor admired his sincerity. From then on, he summoned the Master daily, urging him to reduce slaughter and curb desires. Their conversations spanned thousands of words. *Yēlǜ Jìnqīng*, then a minister, recorded them in *Xuānfēng Qìnghuì Lù*. The Emperor believed and followed them all.

The Emperor asked *Zhèn Hǎi*: *"By what title should the Master be addressed?"*

*Zhèn Hǎi* replied: *"Some honor him as *Fùshī*, others as *Zhēnrén*, still others as *Shénxiān*."*

The Emperor decreed: *"From this day forward, let him be called *Shénxiān*."*

In the spring of *Guǐwǔ*, at the emperor’s command, he was escorted back to Yànjīng by thousands of armored cavalry. *Tiāncháng Guān* was renamed *Chángchūn Gōng*, and *Báiyún Guān* was rebuilt, merging them into one. The *Nán Gōng Wànsuì Shān* and *Tàiyè Chí* were also granted to him, renamed *Wàn’ān Gōng*. The edict commanded all virtuous recluses in the land to join him, and he was given a *jīnhǔ fú* seal to act as he saw fit. Over time, he received countless imperial decrees.

The Master, now overseeing *Chángchūn Gōng*, saw the *Quánzhēn Way* flourish. Leading rituals to invoke winds and rain, his predictions never failed—like echoes and shadows. Ten thousand households turned to him.

In his leisure, after the noon repast, he would ride with a few attendants to *Wàn’ān Gōng*, enjoying the wealth of *Cāoshān Xī*, the evening rest of joyful birds and fish. He visited daily, returning only as dusk fell.

In the sixth month of the year *Dīnghài*, on the twenty-third day, he fell ill and did not leave his quarters. When messengers inquired at the *wǔ* hour, a sudden storm erupted. The southern bank of *Tàiyè Chí* collapsed, flooding into the *Dōng Hú*, its roar heard for tens of *lǐ*. The *diàn’áo yúguī* vanished, and the pool dried up. The northern cliff of the mountain crumbled on its own.

The Master, upon hearing this, laughed and said: *"The mountain crumbles, the pool dries—shall I depart with them?"*

On the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *"Long ago, Dan Yang once foretold to me: 'After my passing, the Dao will flourish greatly, and the four quarters will transform into Daoic lands. You shall be there at that time, presiding over the great observatories, all bestowed with official titles and seals, with envoys bearing symbols and riding in official carriages. This is the moment when one’s merit is complete, one’s name established, and it is time to rest in retirement.' Dan Yang’s words have all come true—I return with no regrets."*

Having declared his illness, on the ninth day, just after noon, he ascended to the *Bǎoxuān Táng* and left behind this verse:

*"Life and death are but morning and evening—
A fleeting bubble, a laborer in the river’s flow.
Where faint light flickers, the hare and tortoise leap,
When profound measure opens, mountains and seas are embraced.
Strumming the eight strings as though within arm’s reach,
Blowing the void into forms like a mechanism’s play.
Mad verses spill like dust beneath the pen,
Left for the age to mock and question in vain."*

He then returned to the *Bǎoguāng Táng*, where he transformed with vibrant grace—like a butterfly emerging.

At that moment, a *qīngluán* crane and a white heron circled above and below, auspicious vapors filled the air, and celestial melodies swirled before he ascended into the sky. Officials and commoners alike knelt in reverence, and his remains were enshrined in the *Shùn Táng* of the *Báiyún Guàn*.

Three years later, when his coffin was opened, his robes were found unchanged, his limbs soft as silk, his complexion as if alive. All his works—songs, essays, letters, treatises, plain speech, and recorded sayings—collected as *Mófēixī Jí*, *Wūdào Jí*, and *Xīyóu Jì*, numbering thousands—circulated in the world.

The *Xuěfēng* eulogy reads:

*"The heavens and earth as hall and chamber,
The sun and moon as lamps and candles.
An old immortal of the *Lóuxiá* peak,
Rising and setting within the *Zhōngsù* hostel.
Before the assembly, he spoke of Heaven’s ways,
His words like ice and jade in flight.
Unlocking the Dao’s subtle mechanisms,
He silently enjoyed the lofty celestial rewards.
His divine refinement—how pure and clear,
His radiance dazzling both eyes.
His rising form—how light and swift,
Healthy winds stirring his sturdy feet.
The Dao flourishes or fades,
Yet all hearts bow in submission.
The Golden Elixir—finished or not,
White clouds fill the valleys and peaks."*

The eulogy continues:

*"I once visited the *Yāntái*, where three men debated the merits of Master Qiu Xian of the Yellow Peak. One said: 'I say his greatest virtue was seven years of toil at Fǎnshuǐ Xi, and years of radiance in the *Bǎoxuān Táng*, laying the foundation for refining the Golden Elixir and planting the Fire Plum and Exchange Pear trees. He entered dreams as spirit, turned earth and heaven—this was his greatest virtue.'

Another replied: 'No. I say his greatest virtue was establishing observatories, teaching and guiding people, opening the full-bloom lotus of the *Quánzhēn*, and planting the shadowless three-flowered tree. Half the world wore the official cap, and all spoke of the Dao in leisure—none failed to drink from the *Chóngxuān*, all were touched by the utmost transformation. This was his greatest virtue.'

The third said: 'Both of you see only the small, grasp only the partial. You take half a fist of *Tàishān* and a leaf from *Děnglín*—you miss the whole.

I say: When the Mongol armies swept south, their horses drank the Yellow River nearly dry, their arrows made *Huàyuè* tremble, and both precious and base were burned, the wise and foolish slaughtered. Corpses piled like mountains, blood like seas—thunderous might, merciless as a tiger. Fortunately, Master Chángchūn Qiu Xian arose at the emperor’s summons. With one audience, the dragon’s wrath eased; with a second, Heaven’s will turned. Those who surrendered were spared, cities that fell were pardoned, conscripts were ransomed, captives set free. Four hundred districts gained peace, tens of thousands of miles received grace. He stretched his arms to block the collapsing peaks, lay his body to dam the flooding river—saving lives from the boiling cauldron, snatching souls from the executioner’s blade. The saved numbered in the hundreds of millions, surpassing even the sacrifices of *Mòtǎn* and *Jīnggāi*.

Such hidden merit ascends to Heaven’s will—why seek the nine-refined cinnabar or seven-returned elixir?'"*

Zhang Shén’tóng’s poem reads:
*"Refining Han’s nine-returned cinnabar,
First in Dao and letters—
The Three Isles await his departure,
To this day, cranes and herons call at *Qíxiá*."*

**Excerpt from *Jīnlián Zhōngzōng Jì Chūn zhī sìjìng* and *Jīnlián Zhōngzōng Jì juàn zhī wǔ***

The forest-dwelling Feathered Guest and the Pine-River Hermit compiled this—
**Master Wáng Zhēnyán** of Jade-Sun.

His given name was Chǔyī, and he was called **Yùyáng Zǐ**—Wáng was his surname, and his home was in Shùmǔ of Nínghǎi.

As a child, he lost his father and served his mother with utmost filial piety.
His stature was towering and robust;
even as a youth, he did not indulge in frivolous play,
preferring instead to recite verses of the Clouds-and-Mists Beyond.

At seven years old, he met **Shùhuá Jiàozhǔ**,
who taught him the secrets of **Eternal Life and Longevity**.

At fourteen, while wandering in the mountains,
he encountered an aged man seated upon a flat rock.
The old man beckoned him forward,
stroked his forehead, and said:
*"On the morrow, thou shalt rise to fame at the Celestial Gate,
and shall become the Great Master of the Mysterious Dao."*

Having spoken thus, the old man stood,
dragged his staff, and walked away.
The Master followed without ceasing,
and asked:
*"Who are you, sir?"*

The old man replied:
*"I am the Master of the **Mysterious Court**."*

Then he turned his head—
and vanished without trace.
From that day onward,
the Master’s speech grew unrestrained and wild,
no longer in harmony with the world,
his movements erratic and unhinged.

The Master arrived in **Dàdìng** during the second month of Spring in the **Year of the Monkey** [大定春二月中]. On a leisurely day, he visited **Fàn Míngshū’s** *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion* [遇仙亭] and there saw **Master Zhòngyáng of Zhōngnán Shān** [终南山重阳祖师].

The Master observed his extraordinary bone structure and frame [骨格非凡], and asked:
*"Would you allow me, humble one, to follow you?"*
The Master replied:
*"This is my deepest wish—how could I dare refuse your command?"* [仆所愿也，敢不唯命]

Thus, he served at the Master’s side,
and with **Qiū Zhēnren**, **Liú Zhēnren**, **Tán Zhēnren**, and **Mǎ Zhēnren**,
they became **unfailing friends** [莫逆之交].
In their pursuit of **Daoist refinement and hidden precepts** [修真秘诀],
they exhausted every inquiry without restraint.

The Master called him and said:
*"The **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞] in **Tiěchá Mountain** [铁查山], **Wéndēng County** [文登县],
is where you shall ascend to **perfect Dao** [登真].
You may dwell there—do not slacken in your efforts.
As for your **Dao-name** [道号] and **surname** [名号],
I shall bestow them upon you in time."*

The Master then bowed and took his leave,
retiring into the cave.

In the fourth month,
when the Master was about to journey to **Lóngquán** [龙泉],
he borrowed **Fàn Míngshū’s parasol** [借范明叔伞] to shield himself from the sun.
**Qiū**, **Liú**, **Tán**, and **Mǎ** went ahead,
while the Master lingered half a *lǐ* behind [可半里许].
Suddenly, he cast the parasol into the air—
it drifted aloft toward the **west-north** [西北],
soaring away without trace.

**Qiū** and **Liú** were startled,
turning back to ask where it had gone.
The Master said:
*"I rode the **Exalted Whirlwind** [搏扶摇] upward—
I know not how it came to pass."*

From the **hour of the Chicken** [自辰] to the **hour of the Dog** [至哺],
the parasol fell before the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞],
shattering its handle.
Within it was inscribed a **Dao-name** [道号]:
*"Jièyáng Zǐ"* [介阳子], with the surname *"Chǔyī"* [处一].
*"Jiè"* sounds like *"zhú"* (bamboo), yet no bamboo character exists in the **Middle Pinyin** [篇韵中本],
for the Master had composed it himself.
The surname *"Chǔyī"* was written as *"七"* (seven),
symbolizing the **seven golden lotuses** [金莲七朵].

Approximately, the place where the parasol was cast
was **two hundred lǐ** distant from the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞].

The Master received it,
and later returned to thank him.
The Master bestowed upon him a verse:
*"Refinement’s principles are marked with utmost care [修行事理记丁宁],
Yet only a tranquil mind brings clarity [只要心中静裹明].
When the eye’s vision ceases, dragons dwell within [眼界不生龙自住],
And when the nostrils close not, tigers rest [鼻门无闭虎常停].
Withdrawing taste from the tongue, the spirit brightens [舌根退味心神爽],
And silencing sound in the ears, the **kidney’s vital water** [肾水] clears.
North and south merge into unity [南北混融归一处],
While **Dao-qi** of the **East and West** [束西交媾] extinguishes the **Three Pāngs** [灭三彭].
Wood and metal blend in harmonious stillness [木金厮枚盘桓住],
And the **Yīnglǎo** [婴姥] follows in effortless ease [自在行].
The **Golden Elixir** [金丹] is forged at the crown of the head,
Its **five radiant lights** [五光] piercing through the **rainbow canopy** [彩云棚]."*

The Master bowed and accepted it.
From then on,
he traveled between **Dēngzhou** [登州] and **Nínghǎi** [宁海],
returning each night to the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞].
For **nine years**, he stood alone,
hoisting one foot in the air [偏翘一足独立].
Facing the **great eastern sea** [东临大海],
he never once dozed off—
men called him the **Iron-Foot Master** [铁脚先生].

**Qiū Zhēnren** praised him thus:
*"In summer, he greets the sun standing upright [九夏迎阳立],
And in winter, he embraces the snow in slumber [三冬抱雪眠].
After nine years of such **body refinement** [炼形],
he entered **Great Miracle** [大妙],
Moving forward and backward with ease,
Sometimes singing, sometimes dancing,
Ascending to the **spirit realm** [出神入梦],
And benefiting all beings he encountered [接物利生]."*

In the **Year of the Monkey** [大定戊申岁],
the **World Sovereign** [世宗] heard his **Dao-worth** [道价] was high,
and sent envoys with offerings to invite him.
Thus, he went to the **Celestial Gate** [赴阙].

The **monks** [僧徒] harbored resentment and envy,
many bribing the imperial attendants [多输金於中使],
claiming the Master was no true immortal,
and that **poisoned wine** [鸩酒] could expose him.
The Sovereign agreed,
and granted him **three cups** [赐之三杯].
The Master drank them,
yet felt no disturbance or agitation—
the poisoners could not harm him.

The Sovereign was astonished and apologized,
bestowing upon him a **golden crown** [金冠] and **Daoist robes** [法服],
a **four-horse carriage** [驷马安车],
and ordering the construction of a **Perfect Dao Hall** [全真堂] for his residence,
even inscribing the plaque himself [仍御书额].

In the **Year of the Rat** [己酉岁], five days after **Qīngmíng Festival** [清明],
he received imperial decree to return to his mountain home [还故山],
and was again granted **vast wealth in gold and silk** [金帛巨万].
He declined with a **tablet of thanks** [表而辞之].

In the **third year of Chéng’ān** [承安三年秋八月],
**Emperor Zhāng** [章宗] summoned him to the capital,
honoring him in the **Convenience Hall** [便殿].
His responses flowed effortlessly,
and the Emperor was deeply pleased,
urging him to accept the title **Tǐxiān Dàshī** [体玄大师],
and to reside in a newly built **Refinement Observatory** [修真观].

In the **Year of the Pig** [泰和壬戌岁],
he journeyed to **Bózhōu** [亳州], the **Tàiqīng Palace** [太清宫],
to oversee the **Universal Dao Ritual** [普天醮事].
Ten thousand **cranes soared** [万鹤翱翔],
and the **Highest Sovereign** [太上] manifested in the clouds,
his face glowing like the sun [面赭於日].
The Master composed a verse:
*"Divine influence spreads from the **Dao-realm** [洞天],
And golden gates perform teachings without bound [金门演教庆无边].
The **Yùyáng Zǐ of the East** [东方云海玉阳子],
Distinctly receives imperial grace—
the **fourth proclamation** [第四宣]."*

Afterward, he returned to the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞],
and **initiated over a thousand Daoists** [度道士者千余众].

In **Dōngmóu** [东牟],
there was a man named **Chí Jīn** [迟金],
a wealthy household [豪家],
who treated the Master with great generosity [待师甚厚].
One day, he fell ill with a sudden **wind evil** [冒风邪],
and though a hundred physicians [百医] could not cure him,
he did not recover.

The Master pitied him,
and commanded that **fifty green fish** [青鱼五十尾] be cooked,
wrapped in cakes for him to consume [以饼卷而餐之].
After eating his fill,
he rose and walked with swiftness—
all in the region were astounded,
and followed his example by seeking transformation.

The Master begged for food in **Fúshān County, Dēngzhou** [福山县],
where he saw **Pān Shānrén** [潘山人] had died and was being prepared for burial [身殁将葬].
He gathered the man’s ears with his hands,
and with a loud voice declared:
*"The **Underworld** [地府] cannot take you!"*
In an instant, the man revived,
eating and drinking as before.

His son offered many riches in gratitude [多以财货谢之],
but the Master only smiled faintly,
waved his sleeve, and departed.
While in **Nínghǎi** [宁海],
two **malefactors** [二凶徒] sought to harm him,
each holding a staff to invite him to drink [各持杖邀师同饮].
When he was nearly drunk,
they planned to strike him together [俟醉而共加捶焉].
Yet before they could act,
the two men **struck each other** [自相欧击],
one dying from the blow.

The onlookers were terrified,
assuming the Master would surely suffer retribution,
with no means of escape.
But the Master cried out in a great voice:
*"The **East Peak** [东岳] cannot take you!"*
In an instant, they recovered,
and the crowd’s worries dissolved.

As he passed through **Jìyáng County** [济阳县],
many sought his **Dao-law** [法名],
and by the **third watch** [将及三鼓],
the Master dipped his brush in ink and wrote:
*"Thieves"** [贼人].
Then with a stern voice, he declared:
*"There are thieves!"*
All rushed out the door,
and saw several armed men,
who fled in panic—
none knew their fate.

Before the **Shèngshuǐ Cave** [圣水洞] stood a massive stone,
jutting out several *zhàng* in length [斜出可数丈许].
Travelers often feared it,
and the crowd proposed removing it.
Hammers and chisels were employed,
yet after many days, only a fraction was broken [击毁百分未及其一].
The Master laughed and approached,
raising his hammer three times—
its sound like thunder [士尸若雷霆],
and the stone collapsed.
A **purple mist** [紫烟] enveloped the cliffs and valleys,
dispersing only after three days.

「In the year of **Bingwu** [丙午] of the **Dàdìng** era [大定丙午岁],
on the day of the **Chóngyáng** descent [重阳降迹],
at the appointed hour of **Fēigǔ** in **Dānyáng** [丹阳飞骨之期],
the Master proceeded to **Lángyá Village** [琅琊村],
where he enticed and transformed the fishermen into abandoning their nets and fishing gear [诱化船户尽焚鱼网],
thus inspiring the **marvelous phenomena** [海市] to manifest in the southeast [感海市现於东南],
with lofty towers and verdant hills,
palaces adorned like pearls—
wonderous sights that astonished five counties [重楼翠阜，具阙珠宫，惊骇数郡].

He then borrowed the **rhyme and meter** [韵] of **Dōngpō** [东坡] to compose a single poem, the full text of which is not recorded here [因借东坡韵书一篇，文多不载].
Including his miracles such as
praying to the **Dragon** [龙] and receiving rain [祷龙即雨],
boiling a chicken and its return to life [烹鸡复还],
pouring wine into a leaky vessel and it not spilling [漏瓶注酒],
or reviving withered branches [枯极生枝],
all of which are too numerous to recount [不可备录].

By the time of the **Zhēnyòu** era [真佑], in the year of **Dīngchǒu** [丁丑], on the twenty-third day of the fourth month [四月二十三日],
a **five-colored cloud** [五色云] arose from the southeast,
and two **green-clad attendants** [二青衣] bore a decree [捧诏] down upon him,
while banners and flags obscured the sky [旌幢蔽天],
and all gazed upon the spectacle in reverence [众皆瞻礼].

The Master told his disciples:
*"The saints have already arrived within the past three days"* [三日已前，众圣皆至].
After speaking, he burned incense to pay homage in all directions [朝礼十方],
then took up his brush and inscribed a **hymn of praise** [颂]:
*"Leaping forth from the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** [乾坤] creative authority,
the divine radiance shines resplendent across all realms [造化权，神光晃朗遍诸天].
Loftily ascending in a **crane’s carriage** [鹤驭], transcending the **Three Realms** [三界],
joyfully receiving the **Golden Book** [金书] and **Jade Emperor’s** [玉帝] proclamation [喜受金书玉帝宣].
With the stroke of his pen, he lay down and slept,
and suddenly returned to his **true form** [奄然返真],
his **auspicious light** [祥光] filling the mountains and valleys,
his **lucky qi** [瑞气] enveloping the rivers and plains,
remaining for several days before dispersing [数日不散].

The poems he composed in his lifetime number nearly a thousand [平生所集歌诗近千余首],
which he titled *Qīngzhēn Collection* [《清真集》] and *Lěimǎiguāng Collection* [《蕾买光集》],
both widely circulated in the world [盛行於世].

The **eulogy** [赞] reads:
*"Refining essence into **Jade Elixir** [玉阳], concealing light within **Sacred Water** [圣水],
a **bamboo parasol** [竹伞] held in his hand—
the **name** [名号] secretly transmitted within its grasp [柠砾],
beneath **Iron Rod Mountain** [铁查山], many **practices** [工夫] were performed [多做].
Through three winters, he embraced the snow in tranquil repose [三冬抱雪以安眠],
and in nine summers, he welcomed the sun to stand firm [九夏迎阳而坤立].
Thus, he could harmonize the **Southern and Northern** [南北] into a single **Dao** [归一处],
and reconcile the **Eastern and Western** [东西] to extinguish the **Three Pèngs** [灭三彭].
He was repeatedly spoken of by **Daoist Immortals** [仙圣] and **saints** [传言],
and four times received imperial decrees [四感帝王之降诏].
He drank **poisoned wine** [鸩酒] yet his **luster** [容光] remained unaltered,
and when the fishermen’s nets were burned, the **marvelous phenomena** [海市] surged across the sky [横空].
Though **Pan Gong** [潘公] had already passed away [已死],
he was revived by the **three shouts** [三喝]—
and though he had long been **paralyzed** [久瘫],
he was granted **one elixir** [一养] and rose again [再起].

A **child disciple** [童子] emerged from the furnace [炉内],
while **Lǎojūn** [老君] manifested in the clouds above [高显於云端].
With his hand raised, wielding an **iron hammer** [铁锤],
the great stone had already been heard crashing into the ravine [巨石已闻於落涧],
and with his mouth transmitting the **Jade Precepts** [玉诀],
the mountains trembled in response [群山竟见於摇峰].
Without roots, the branches and leaves regenerated [无根根上枝叶重生],
and in the bottomless vessel, the wine flowed endlessly without leakage [没底壶中酒嘐不漏].
The **crane descended** [鹤降] and danced repeatedly before the altar [屡舞],
while the **boiled chicken** [鸡烹] was heard crowing again on its perch [架上重呜].
The **thieves**, wielding their weapons, turned to leisurely wandering [反逍],
and the **malevolent**, raising their clubs, fell into their own traps [自欧].
Leaping forth from the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** [乾坤] creative authority,
he manipulated the **mechanisms of sun and moon** [斡回日月之机关].

Under his **platform** [席下], disciples numbered in the thousands [数千百众],
while those he personally guided amounted to hundreds [亲度者].
His **lifetime techniques** [手段]—
those shared by his followers—totaled thirty-six [共传者三十六端].
Thus, he could receive the **Jade Emperor’s** [玉帝] proclamation,
and attend the **Golden Lotus Assembly** [金莲之会].

**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:
*"His fame was so high that he once received imperial proclamation,
sensing the **Golden Book** [金书] granted to embody the **Mystic Dao** [体玄].
Having perfected **Daoist virtue** [道德] and transformed his **Divine Form** [神],
beneath **Iron Rod Mountain** [铁查山], the **Sacred Water** [水] remains as before [依然].
Thus recorded in the **Fifth Volume of the Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage** [金莲正宗记卷之五],
compiled by **Línjiān Yùkè** [林间羽客] and **Línjiān Zhāliè Dàorén** [柠砾道人].」

**Hè Zhēnrén of Guǎngníng** [郝真人]—
Master surnamed **Hè** [郝], given name **Lǐn** [璘], styled **Tiánrán Zǐ** [恬然子], and self-named **Tàigǔ Dàorén** [太古道人].
His ancestral home was **Nínghǎi** [宁海], where his family had long practiced the **Daoist Way of Wandering and Officialdom** [游宦].
Master **Hè** was the younger brother of **Zhāng Liè** [张列], who served in the imperial court.
He was deeply filial to his mother, possessed a rich and graceful nature, and held no ambition for worldly honors or official rank.
He delved deeply into the **divinatory arts** [卜筮之数], and never let go of the **Yellow Old** [黄老] and **Zhuangzi’s** [庄] teachings.

Whenever he encountered secluded groves and quiet streams, he would linger there, forgetting the return home until day’s end.
In the autumn of **Dīnghài** [丁亥, 1167] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, he sold divinations in the marketplace,
while scholars and officials gathered around him in attendance.
**Zhòngyáng** [重阳] arrived last, sitting with his back turned.
Master **Hè** said, *"Why not turn around?"*
**Zhòngyáng** replied, *"I fear you would not turn around."*
Master **Hè** was startled and quickly rose to pay respects,
then invited **Zhòngyáng** to another place for leisurely conversation.
Their exchanges flowed like stones dropped into water—
quick, resonant, and profound.
Master **Hè** presented a poem:
*"The gentlemen at my side delight in the **Way of Tàigǔ** [太古],
yet they still seek the **Unseen Path of Black and White** [黑白希夷路].
Today, I meet a **Daoist Sage** [达人] who sings of it—
I humbly await your **Jade Words** [玉句] to enlighten me."*

**Zhòngyáng** responded:
*"I praise **Master Hè** for his mastery of ancient lore,
and speak of the **Path of the Divine Martial** [神仙路].
His feet ask of the **Emerald Mists** [翠雾] that greet him in coming days,
while I urge him to embrace the **Sage’s Stillness** [清静句]."

Master **Hè** read this, filled with joy, and returned home.

The following year, in the **Wùzǐ** [戊子, 1168] era, during the third month,
he went alone to **Kūnjiàn Mountain’s** [昆箭山] **Yānyán Cave** [烟霞洞],
burning incense in reverence and humbly offering his services.
**Zhòngyáng** bestowed upon him the **Daoist name** [法名] **"Dàtōng"** [大通],
styled him **Guǎngníng Zǐ** [广宁子], and placed him among **Qiū** [丘], **Liú** [刘], **Tán** [谭], and **Mǎ** [马]
to serve at his side.

By the seventh month, **Zhòngyáng** ordered all his disciples to return to **Nínghǎi** [宁海],
leaving only **Qiū** [丘] at his side.
After a few days, **Zhòngyáng** sent **Qiū** [丘] to summon **Master Hè** [太古].
When he arrived, **Zhòngyáng** said,
*"I have cut the sleeves of my robe in two—
I need them to patch my back,
so you may wear them for winter.
I will mend my own sleeves afterward."*
Master **Hè** bowed in acceptance—
a **symbol of the ancient transmission of the robe** [传衣之法].

After this, **Zhòngyáng** returned south to **Biànliáng** [汴梁],
while Master **Hè** traveled between **Héběi** [河北].
In the **Yǐwèi** [乙未, 1175] era, he begged for food in **Wò State** [沃州],
when he suddenly understood **Zhòngyáng’s** hidden words,
and his mind opened like water released from a dam.
He then sat silently on a bridge,
neither seeking food nor complaining of hunger or cold,
accepting alms only when offered,
and enduring insults without anger—
his resolve was to **forget the form** [忘形].
Thus, for three years, people called him **Silent Master** [不语先生].

One night, the sky darkened, and a drunken passerby,
mistaking his stillness for weakness,
kicked Master **Hè** into the river below the bridge.
He remained motionless for seven days,
and none knew where he had gone.
A traveler’s horse suddenly reared and refused to move forward,
though he beat it relentlessly.
The traveler dismounted and asked his attendants,
*"There must be some strange matter beneath this bridge—
otherwise, why would my horse be so alarmed?"*
He ordered them to investigate,
and they found a **Daoist** [道者] sitting quietly in the darkness.
When questioned, he did not speak,
but traced the earth with his hand and said,
*"I have not eaten for seven days."*
The townsfolk heard this,
rushed to offer him food,
and begged him to emerge.
Yet he only shook his head in refusal,
and sat there another three years—
**water and fire inverted** [水火颠倒], **yin and yang harmonized** [阴阳和合].
His **Nine Transformations** [九转] were complete.

Then, he rose and departed,
his staff and sandals striking northward,
lingering in **Zhēndìng** [真定] and its environs,
where countless seekers came to learn from him.
He established **Daoist halls** [宫观] and ascended the platform to guide disciples,
and the **Mystic Dao** [玄风] flourished anew.
He displayed the **Sutra of Awakening in the South Grove** [《悟南柯》] to the assembly:
*"Earth’s lungs, **Zhòngyáng** [重阳],
**Kūnjiàn’s** [昆箭] **Tàigǔ Sage** [太古仙],
the two of us bound in **pre-birth vow** [结约未生前].
We descended from **Great Luo Heaven** [大罗天],
dwelling in the mundane world,
to expound the **Teachings of the Mystic Origin** [玄元教].
Our **hidden and revealed deeds** [行藏] were marked by **green jade** [有绿],
yet how could we fail to awaken like flowing waters?
After parting, we met again—
and swore to reunite in a thousand years."*

Since the **Míngchāng** [明昌] era,
he returned to **Shù State** [束州] and built a separate **Daoist retreat** [琳宇],
where he guided many disciples.
Three years before his passing,
he ordered craftsmen to carve an **Earthly Tomb** [地宫] for him,
lining it with **jade** [璧],
and would rest there daily,
telling them,
*"On the thirty-first day of the twelfth month, I shall depart."*
For three years, his **Daoist essence** [法体] remained robust.
To his disciples, he said,
*"My Master truly has a **vow with Penglai** [蓬莱之约],
and now I return to him."*
With these words, he **discarded the external to return to the true** [外而返真],
just as the **thirty-first day of the twelfth month** arrived.
He lived to eighty-four years of age.

Throughout his life, he **sang hymns of praise** [歌颂],
deeply understanding the **sayings of Inverted Dragon and Tiger** [龙虎颠倒],
and the **cyclical rise and fall of the hexagrams and lines** [卦爻升降].
His works were called *The **Tàigǔ Collection*** [《太古集》],
and they spread widely in the world.

**Eulogy:**
*"The **Guǎngníng Daoist** [广宁道人] exhaustively explored the **symbols of the *Yì*** [《易》].
He despised the **coarse mien of the age** [俗态],
abandoning wife and children in an instant,
and sought the **Mystic Dao** [玄风],
delighting to receive the **Daoist cap** [簪冠].
He **returned and hid** [归、隐] in the **Yānyán Cave** [烟霞洞],
and **reverently paid homage** [恭礼] beneath **Zhòngyáng’s** platform.
Through **diligent practice** [工夫], he **turned his essence** [展转],
and **employed his techniques** [手段] with mastery.
He **proclaimed the essence of Tàigǔ** [太古之精华],
and **absorbed the marrow of the Full Perfection Dao** [全真之骨髓].
He **aligned with the tortoise and serpent** [按龟蛇],
and **swirled the Dragon and Tiger** [运龙虎].
In **Nínghǎi’s** marketplace, he **secretly grasped the robe’s transmission** [暗得传衣之妙],
and beneath **Wò State’s** bridge, he **steadfastly held to the alchemical refinement of qi** [坚持炼气之功].
He **observed the body from beyond the body** [身外观身],
and **settled the mouth within the mouth** [口中安口].
When the **Three Pengs** [三彭] were extinguished,
**water and fire inverted** [水火颠倒],
and when the **Four Qi** [四气] flowed freely,
**lead and mercury harmonized** [铅汞调和],
the **Nine Transformations’ Elixir** [九转丹] naturally formed,
and the **Three Treasures’ Fruit** [三华果] ripened.
He fulfilled his **preordained vow with Penglai** [蓬壶之旧约],
and **foretold the month of his departure** [预占腊月之尽期].
If not for one who **dwells in the world yet communicates with the unseen** [迹寄人问，心通象外],
who could attain such heights?"

**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:
*"In the marketplace or on the mountain, he follows **Nature** [自然].
Within stillness, he **penetrates the Mystic *Yì*** [易中玄].
Now, he drinks beyond **Penglai’s** heights,
and through the ages, **Tàigǔ’s** **Sage** [太古仙] is passed down."*

**Fifth Volume of the *Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage*** [金莲正宗记卷之五],
compiled by **Línjiān Yùkè** [林间羽客] and **Línjiān Zhāliè Dàorén** [柠砾道人].

**The Daoist Maiden of Pure Quietness** [清静散人], surnamed **Xiāngū** [仙姑], was the youngest daughter of **Sūn Zhōngyàn** [孙忠斓]. Her family lineage traced back to **Níngchū** [宁初], and her mother once dreamed of seven cranes gathering silk quilts to dance in the courtyard. After some time, six cranes flew away, leaving only one that entered her embrace. Upon waking, she found herself with child, and thus this maiden was born.

By nature, she was exceedingly bright and in her secluded chambers, she adhered strictly to ritual and law. Skilled in calligraphy and literature, she excelled particularly in **poetic compositions** [昤咏].

When she became a widow, she married into the **Mǎ** [马] family and bore three sons, all of whom she instructed in **moral and medicinal arts** [义方].

In the winter of **Dīnghài** [丁亥] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** [重阳先生] arrived from **Zhōngnán** [终南]. **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** [马宜甫] treated him with great hospitality, but the maiden did not fully trust him. She confined the master within her **hermitage** [庵] for over a hundred days, providing neither food nor drink, and only glimpsed him through the gate. Yet his complexion and bearing surpassed even his usual state, and only then did she embrace his teachings with faith.

Even afterward, the maiden would **manifest divine forms** [神入梦] in dreams and visions, terrifying him with depictions of **hellish realms** [地狱] and enticing him with visions of **heavenly paradises** [天堂]. She bestowed upon him **ten divisions of alms** [十度分梨] and **six rounds of taro gifts** [六番赐芋], and thus **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** followed her as a disciple, entering the **Dao** [道]. Yet the maiden’s affection for her sons lingered, and she hesitated, waiting another year before finally abandoning them—**clad in bamboo hat and coarse robe** [竹冠布袍]—and journeying to the **Golden Lotus Hall** [金莲堂] of her native state to pay homage to **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** and seek **initiation** [度].

The master bestowed upon her a poem:
*"Ten alms of divided fruit were given last year,
Heaven’s timing was ever natural, no need to fear.
Why did you not then depart from mortal ties?
Ah, you waited only to pluck the Golden Lotus."*

He further bestowed upon her a **Daoist name** [法名], **Bù Èr** [不二], and a **Daoist title** [道号], **Qīngjìng Sǎnrén** [清静散人]. He instructed her in the **mystic seals of the Celestial Talisman** [天符云篆], granting her the **secret precepts** [秘诀] alone.

When **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** later passed away in **Bìngliáng** [汴梁] and his remains were returned to **Zhōngnán** [终南] for burial, carried by **Qiū** [丘], **Liú** [刘], **Tán** [谭], and **Mǎ** [马], the maiden heard of it and set out westward, **ascending clouds and crossing moons** [穿云度月], **sleeping in frost and enduring snow** [外雪眠霜], disfiguring her form yet not feeling the pain. By the **first month of Rénchén** [壬辰] spring, she arrived at **Zhào Pénglái’s** [赵蓬莱] residence in **Jīngzào** [京兆], where she met **Dānyáng** [丹阳]. Together, they **shared profound insights** [参同妙旨] and **delved into the depths of Daoist principles** [转涉理窟].

**Dānyáng** then bestowed upon her the **Elixir Refining Sand** [《炼丹砂》]:
*"Serve the maiden of Fùchūn* [富春姑],
Do not follow me blindly—
Now you are neither woman nor man.
Each must refine their own **true essence** [真面目],
Escape the **Three Defilements** [三涂],
And **cultivate the Dao’s qi** [炼气]—do not let the **Hall of Elixir** [厅] deceive you.
Above and below, all is **expansive ease** [宽舒],
Endless as the **mystic breath of the cosmos** [绵绵似有却如无].
Wrap yourself in **embodied purity** [个裹灵童],
**Harmonize the vital forces** [调引动],
And you shall reach the **Daoist capital** [仙都]."

The maiden accepted this with gratitude and parted, each traveling to their own place to **refine the heart within humble walls** [炼心环堵]. Seven years later, her **Three Fields** [三田] were restored, and her **hundred orifices** [百窍] flowed freely.

Then she arose and set out, wandering through **Luòyáng** [洛阳], **guiding and transforming** [劝化接引] and **initiating many disciples** [度人甚多]. One day, she inscribed the **Divination Song** [卜算子]:
*"With firm resolve, she clutches her robe and waits,
As **water and fire** [水火] merge in ceaseless embrace.
A million **Daoist paths** [万道] bloom in the **sea of luminous qi** [霞光海底],
A single strike pierces the **Three Passes** [一撞三关].
**Celestial music** [仙乐] resounds repeatedly,
Ever drinking the **fermented Daoist wine** [酝酬酒].
No need to ask for **wondrous elixirs** [妙药] in every fleeting moment—
The **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂] is complete."*

Upon finishing, she told her disciples:
*"The master’s **true essence** [真] has its **preordained vow** [约],
Each must now return to the **Jade Pool** [瑶池].
My **Daoist term** [仙期] has arrived."*

She bathed and changed her clothes, then asked those around her:
*"How early or late is the **heavenly hour** [天气]?"*
They replied:
*"It is high noon."*
She then **assumed the lotus posture** [结踟趺], sat **serene and upright** [奄然端坐], and **entered the Dao’s natural state** [处顺]. Her visage remained as if alive, and **fragrant breezes** [香风] filled the room. **Auspicious qi** [瑞气] swirled about, descending over the fields, never dispersing throughout the day. This occurred on the **twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month in Rényuán** [壬寅年十二月二十九日].

At that very time, **Dānyáng** resided within the **Nínghǎi** [宁海] hermitage, gazing upward. He saw the maiden ascending on **five-colored auspicious clouds** [五色祥云], drifting gracefully in the sky, and she spoke to him with a smile:
*"I have already returned to **Penglai** [蓬莱] ahead of you."*

**Dānyáng**, hearing this, **swept his robes aside** [拂衣] and danced in celebration, composing the **"Drunken Daoist’s Order"** [《醉仙令》] to rejoice in his own attainment. The **eulogy** [赞] reads:

*"Lofty is the name **Bù Èr** [不二],
Great is the **cultivation of Oneness** [守一功].
Descended from the **Fùchūn** [富春] clan,
Born into the **Zhōngshàng** [忠翔] family,
Paired with **Dānyáng’s** transcendent talent [超世之才],
And nurtured by **Nínghǎi’s** half-state [半州之产].
Severing love, she cast aside her three sons at once,
And **entered the Mystic** [投玄] to worship **Zhòngyáng** [重阳].
Disfiguring her radiant form to cross westward to **Zhōngnán** [终南],
Enduring wind and frost to depart from the **sea’s embrace** [海上].
Seven years within humble walls,
She refined the **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂],
And with a single **true utterance** [一句真诠],
Pierced the **Three Passes’ orthodox path** [三关正路].
Six times she gave taro,
Ten times she divided fruit—
She planted **karmic seeds beyond the ages** [劫外之因绿],
And returned the **transformation within the Elixir Field** [壶中造化].
She **nurtured the Daoist embryo** [养胎仙] while her heart wandered freely,
And **shed her mortal husk** [委蜕壳] to arrive at **Penglai** [蓬莱].
Great indeed, marvelous indeed—
She alone **shared a single Golden Lotus** [独分一朵之金莲],
And **attained a place among the Seven True Ones** [得预七真之仙列]."*

**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:
*"Washed clean of rouge, her cheeks glow like twin clouds,
Ten years’ toil cultivated the **Golden Elixir’s seed** [黄芽].
With attainment, she strides firm upon the **Azure Crane’s back** [青鸾],
And blooms fully in the **Golden Lotus’s seventh phase** [第七华]."
