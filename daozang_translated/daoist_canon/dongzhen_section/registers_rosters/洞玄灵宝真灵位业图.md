### *The Chart of the True Spirits’ Ranks and Duties of the Dongxuan Lingbao*

#### Preface
Gazing upward to mirror the subtle essence, one discerns the vast and minute of radiant luminosity; looking downward upon the level expanse, one perceives the loftiness and profundity of mountains and seas. Searching and inquiring into the web of humanity, one exhausts the gradations of ranks and orders; studying and synthesizing the celestial scriptures, one fathoms the stages and duties of the true spirits.

Yet names and titles may be hidden or manifest, and designations of learning may advance or recede. Within the four palaces, doubts and similarities intermingle. Now, it is fitting to rectify and classify, to verify and collate the rituals and vestments, to equalize their heights and depths, and to demarcate their palace domains.

There are also instances of singular designations—such as the Supreme August Dao Lord and the Five Emperors and Seven Elders—of which this is but one example. Some merely list names, like the cases of Mo Yu and Meng Zhuo. Others hold the same rank but differ in office, such as the Four Emperors of the Golden Tower and the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, as well as those in subordinate teachings. Those whose duties are equal but whose traces differ are exemplified by the various *bu gang* (step-registers).

For instance, the Perfected of the Rare Grove serves as the Right Duke of the Grand Tenuity, while also overseeing the Prime Minister of the Nine Palaces. Yet it remains unclear whether he is the Supreme Clarity of the Northern Banquet or a familiar attendant of the lower ranks. Such cases abound, and definitive proof is elusive.

Thus, I have followed the principle of inheriting their designated roles while aligning them with the highest domain. Matters are roughly arranged in order, and a brief exposition is provided in the subsequent sections.

Should my shallow understanding, born of inferior birth, rashly rank the exalted sages, disrupting the proper order of ascent and descent and confounding the original hierarchy of steps, I would incur the censure of the Mystic Bureau and entangle myself in the retributions of the Nether Court. With reverence, I humbly present this, beseeching illumination. If it is deemed improper, I pray for admonishment.

What is herein expounded and connected truly embodies the profound purport of the annotations and preserves the essential aim of devotion. In prayers and supplications, one must defer to the hierarchy of ranks; in encounters with the true and the transcendent, one must discern the weight of the engagement.

Thus, the Three Lords jointly declined, first addressing the errors of those whose learning has not yet grasped the essence. When lower ranks occupy higher positions, even the wise may suffer from obstructions of understanding. Though all may bear the title of Perfected, the true grades number in the dozens; though all may be called Immortals, the ranks of immortals span billions. Without precise mastery of the details and a rough understanding of the lineage, one is like a rustic entering the imperial court, mistaking a crimson-robed clerk for a high official, or a Goguryeo tribesman in the Central Kingdom, calling everyone a *canjun*. How could they distinguish the noble from the base or discern the differences in titles and ranks?
