**Preface to the Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life**

The Heavenly Worthy manifests across the Three Realms, compassionately pitying the Four Kinds of Beings. He opens the gate of myriad wonders and delivers those from boundless suffering. Thus, he bestows the scriptures of the mysterious teaching and subtly intones the wondrous sound, enabling the unhearing to hear and the unenlightened to awaken.

This scripture was composed by the Supreme Venerable Sovereign, the Most High Lord Lao. Its purport is the root of the wondrous nature and the origin of the ten thousand dharmas. Though its text is concise, its principles run profoundly deep—like a single hair swallowing the waves of the four seas, or a tiny grain containing an immeasurable multitude. Its numinosity is unfathomable, its wisdom beyond explication. It cannot be sought through sound nor perceived through form. Remote yet without exclusion, near yet without intimacy, pursued yet unseen ahead, awaited yet unapproachable from behind. Above the highest, it cannot be ascended by steps. Mysterious beyond the mysterious, it cannot be heard.

It precedes Heaven yet is not ancient, enduring through vast kalpas without end. Revered yet nameless, exalted yet without rank, it pervades myriad transformations in an instant, boundless and fleeting. When it illumines, even the sun and moon wane; when it sustains, even Heaven and Earth are not all-encompassing. Adapting to conditions, it transforms and guides; confronting circumstances, it forgets the mind. It resolves the web of doubt to enter the mysterious teaching, leading the wheel of rebirth to return to the path of awakening. It disperses the remnant qi to nurture the multitudes of beings. Lose it, and time flees like rushing water; preserve it, and one remains ageless beyond the later Heaven.

Those who revile it wield vast brooms to sweep Mount Kunlun; those who delve into it resemble swans and herons drinking from the vast sea. Thus, the mysterious words remain unexpressed, and the sagely Dao is hard to manifest. Even with cultivation, mere recitation abounds; though one may hear it at dawn and die by dusk, none have truly grasped it. Undeterred by my inadequacy, I have presumptuously composed this hymn.

**Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Ascent to the Mysterious Wondrous Scripture for Eliminating Disasters and Protecting Life**

Adrift in the River of Love, blown by the Sea of Desire—
Who says the river and sea are vast? Their depths may yet be known.
But the passions of love and desire have no bottom—when shall escape come?

Ensnared in sound and form,
Like waterfowl and wind through forests, all return to the single Dharma-sound.
Yet how does the inverted nature arise, spawning a myriad minds?

Bewildered by existence and non-existence,
Emptiness contains forms, forms return to emptiness.
If the mind is clear and discerning, it wields existence and non-existence at will.

No-emptiness and emptiness, no-form and form—
No-emptiness is not empty; no-form is not formless.
If one knows form and emptiness, both form and emptiness are naturally attained.

No-nothing and nothing, existence and no-existence—
Existence includes no-existence; nothing encompasses existence and non-existence.
With a vacant mind, unmoved, the wondrous Dao naturally abides.

From beginning to end, obscured and dim, unable to illuminate itself—
Like one entering darkness, what can the eyes perceive?
To see clearly, one must rely on the lamp of vast kalpas.

Ultimately deluded,
With form and formlessness, confusion persists.
Not yet awakened to the luminous nature, how can doubts be resolved?

The Heavenly Worthy declares:
"All you sentient beings—
Your natures are inferior, lost to the root of the Dao.
I specially proclaim this principle to guide you into the wondrous gate.

From non-existence arises existence; from non-nothing arises nothing.
Things emerge from non-existence; the Dao vanishes within existence.
Do not cling to views of existence and non-existence—delusion will dissolve on its own.

No-form within form, no-emptiness within emptiness—
Emptiness and form mutually arise, entwined like tangled ink.
To know the principle of emptiness and form, do not separate emptiness from form.

Not-existence as existence, not-nothing as nothing—
The nature of the Dao is fundamentally empty and non-existent, yet even emptiness and non-existence are provisional names.
If one clings to views of existence and non-existence, one remains bound by dharmas.

Not-form as form, not-emptiness as emptiness—
Non-emptiness is true emptiness; non-form is true form.
When emptiness and form are thus, they become real—yet where is the true Dharma found?

Emptiness is emptiness, yet emptiness is not fixed;
Form is form, yet form is not fixed.
This emptiness and this form—ultimately, they are not separate.
To recognize true emptiness and form, turn the mind inward and observe the self.

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
If one knows emptiness is not empty and form is not form,
Emptiness and form should both be dissolved—no need to grasp one corner.
Form and emptiness are unobstructed; the original nature is thusness itself.

This is called illumination, the beginning of attaining the wondrous sound.
The wondrous sound is likened to the empty nature, yet the empty mind is not the wondrous sound.
To grasp even a hair’s worth of it is to lose the freedom of the mind.

Comprehending the Dharma of no-emptiness, perceiving without obstruction—
With one mind, observe all things; all dharmas are the same.
If one understands thus, true wisdom is attained.

Entering the gate of myriad wonders, natural awakening arises.
Awakening to the root of nature is called entering the wondrous gate.
The wondrous gate is the expedient Dharma—do not cling to this Dharma.

Free from the web of doubts, unattached to views of emptiness—
Shatter the net of doubt; neither existence nor non-existence pertains.
With a rectified mind, abide in eternal ease, as if ascending a clouded plateau.

Purify the six senses, sever perverse obstructions—
With a tranquil mind, the six senses are pure; the six senses follow the nature.
If the nature is unattached to things, where do perverse obstructions arise?

Thus, I expound this wondrous scripture for you, named *The Scripture for Protecting Life*.
The wondrous scripture is the unobstructed nature; provisionally, it is given this name.
I speak it for the sake of sentient beings, that they may awaken to this scripture.

Deliver sentient beings, carry it with you as an offering—
The One Reality delivers all, like an oar crossing the raging current.
The true nature is always with you—do not seek it outside the self.

Disseminate the teaching in the world, circulate and recite it—
Propagate the principle of emptiness; let it spread throughout the world.
Recite the scripture ten thousand times, and its meaning will become clear.

Then shall the Flying Heavenly Deva-Kings and the Diamond Warriors Who Shatter Evil..."*

The true nature is called the Divine King;
The Flying Heavenly Ones have no fixed abode.
They dispel evil from without,
Unshakable as diamond.

The Dharma-Protecting Spirit Youths, the Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Ones, the Golden Essence Fierce Beasts—
The Spirit Youths are the true nature;
Unstained, they are called Perfected Ones.
Fierce as lions,
Their names differ, yet they share one Dharmakāya.

Hundreds of millions of hosts,
All come to guard and serve this scripture.
All devas and all holy multitudes—
Not one, not two,
Their nature does not follow the flowing waves:
This is called true guardianship.

Wherever offerings are made,
They ward off calamity and sustain the weak.
In speech or silence, in movement or rest,
Not a single thought of arising arises.
Forgetting form, they merge into the indistinct,
Where neither gods nor ghosts can spy.

They deliver all sentient beings,
Freeing them from all defilements.
The true Dharma delivers the perverse Dharma;
Sentient beings see with partial vision.
If one generates no seeing,
The field of the mind is defiled.

Then the Heavenly Venerable spoke these verses:
The Heavenly Venerable repeated the verses,
Directly pointing to the source of the mind,
That all may return to the gate of liberation.

Seeing does not perceive me;
Hearing does not attain me.
The Dao is not in seeing or hearing—
Seeing and hearing breed doubt.
Responding to things as they arise,
With an empty mind, it may be known.

Departing from all extremes,
This is called the wondrous Dao.
The mind doubts, following the ten thousand conditions;
Following conditions, it mistakes the field of the mind.
The Dao is not being or non-being—
Only then is it called departing from all extremes.

*The Laudatory Verses of the Supreme Ascension to the Mysterious, Disaster-Dispelling, Life-Protecting Wondrous Scripture* concludes.
