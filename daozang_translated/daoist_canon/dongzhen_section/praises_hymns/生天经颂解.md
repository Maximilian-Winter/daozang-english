**Hymn by Chaoranzi**

The Most High and Vast Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
Guiding all beings, root of the ten thousand dharmas.
Lord of the thirty-two heavens,
Immutable and thus revered as the Supreme.

Expounding this scripture of ascending to heaven—
Heaven is born, earth is born, and man is born;
The four images and three powers nurture the five phases.
Without form or name, the beginning of heaven and earth;
With feeling and form, the essence of all things.

The true scripture of attaining the Dao:
Deep roots and firm stems begin in the center,
Returning to life and root to establish true origin.
Refined in the golden crucible of nine suns,
Wisdom’s light shines throughout heaven and earth.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
In the vast and undifferentiated primordial source,
Seeming both existent and non-existent, in the realm of indistinction,
Utterly still and void, yet containing all phenomena,
Gradually gave rise to the five great origins, establishing man and heaven.

On Jade Capital Mountain in the Great Canopy Heaven,
The Great Canopy Heaven’s Jade Capital Mountain,
Vast and bright, free of dust, beyond all coming and going.
Awakening in an instant, the realm of stillness arises;
Delusion is as distant as ten thousand barriers.

Addressing the immortals, he said: "I shall now briefly reveal the mysteries of body and mind—
The wondrous form of emptiness opens body and mind,
Temporarily borrowing the mortal frame to govern the subtle principle.
The golden mouth discloses the mysteries of heaven and earth,
The numinous light radiates the mechanism of the primordial chaos.

Illuminating the essentials of the Dao:
The essentials of the Dao are profound and subtle, neither being nor non-being.
From non-being, the formed body is born;
Within being, the formless body is refined.
Abiding beyond all things, free and at ease.

All perfected immortals of the ten directions attain the subtle mysteries through the cultivation of this scripture—
Eighteen thousand chapters establish the wondrous mystery;
Ascending to heaven and attaining the Dao begins with immortal practice.
The river of desire must be crossed by boat,
Yet upon reaching the shore, the boat is left behind as nature dictates.

Good men and good women,
The Heavenly Worthy’s universal transformation pervades the ten directions,
Seeing no distinction between male and female, all as one body.
Generally, by calming the mind and revering the supreme Dao,
The wise and foolish, the ordinary and sacred, all become immortals.

Relying on fasting and precepts as the bridge:
Purifying the mind and guarding the breath are true fasting and precepts;
Eliminating passion and desire is the bridge.
When realms vanish and the mind is forgotten, no defilement remains—
Where is the numinous clarity not perfectly round and square?

All conditioned phenomena reveal the true and manifest—
Before mind and form stir, there is non-action;
When simplicity scatters, form arises, and there is action.
By borrowing the false to nurture the true, the true is revealed—
Do not lose your numinous bearing for the sake of false things.

Embodying these dharmic signs, one may receive and uphold them:
Seeking fish and rabbit, one uses traps and snares;
Having caught the rabbit, the trap is forgotten; so too with the fish.
Though one may receive and uphold them with form,
Non-action transcends both the conditioned and the unconditioned.

Able to screen out all conditions, forever eliminating defilements and attachments—
Outwardly, one relies on conditions in perfect roundness,
Yet do not let fame and profit sever your root.
The great bell, when struck, sounds in response,
But responding without mind, both matters are complete.

External thoughts do not enter, internal thoughts do not exit—
The six gates are tightly sealed,
Do not let the three corpses roam freely.
When the two substances harmonize, the precious crucible is gathered;
A single silver flame emerges from Kunlun.

Thus, the five viscera are purified and frozen, the six bowels are harmonized and at peace—
The one *qi* at the center of the four images
Circulates freely through the three realms.
In the fire of the Green Dragon, cold mist arises;
From the pool of the White Tiger, red smoke billows.

Within the three hundred and sixty joints, all obstructions—
The three threes and six sixes form the body,
Mouth, body, mind, eyes, ears, and nose.
Initially, the seven emotions lead to attachment and defilement;
Eliminating the ten evils, one recognizes the primordial origin.

The one hundred and eighty afflictions—
The seven emotions and three karmas sever the numinous source,
Half the body is mortal, half immortal.
Refined into the utmost yang, the formless rite—
Naturally, afflictions do not interfere.

All sources of suffering and sin
Are entirely eradicated—
The three Pengs, unrestrained, are the root of karma;
The five desires, indulged, invite calamity.
When sin and karma are eliminated, there is no suffering;
Naturally, one transcends the barrier of life and death.

Then, drawing in the true *qi* of great harmony,
Directing the mind to the field of the body—
With settled intent and peaceful mind, do not force;
The continuous ebb and flow naturally circulates.
The flowery pond irrigates the three fields,
Nurturing the immortal fungus to feed the white ox.

The five viscera and six bowels, inwardly observed with the mind’s eye—
The five *qi* return to the origin, the five *qi* are purified;
The six yins are exhausted, the six yangs are born.
The wisdom eye opens, clearly perceiving—
Within and without, no dust, the body is naturally true.

All true *qi* is pure, luminous,
Void and white, radiant—
The numinous light of void and white illumines the great emptiness,
Shining brilliantly, enduring from ancient times to the present.
Do not compare it to the bright moon and clear wind—
Wind and moon never long endure.

Vast and obscure, within and without, nothing stirs—
Within, no response; without, no seeking;
True joy, true delight, free and at ease.
Dim and silent, as if drunk or dreaming,
Yet nothing whatsoever clings to the mind.

Dim and silent, truly attaining non-action—
Vague and boundless, as if existent, as if not;
In dimness and obscurity, the nature is tranquil and empty.
Coming and going in the dharma-realm, without abiding,
Non-action and non-creation realize the primordial origin.

Enduring through ancient and modern times, maintaining the stillness of thought—
Eons stretch endlessly, neither being nor non-being,
Neither increasing nor decreasing, neither empty nor non-empty.
The ten thousand acres of the Yangtze, without waves,
Profoundly clear and still, the winds and waves cease.

From this, understanding dawns, the power of the Dao aids and supports—
The clouds of delusion disperse, the heavens and earth grow still;
The void is brightly illuminated, like a mirror.
The jade hare hastens to the crimson palace,
The golden crow flies into the vast and cold moon.

The dharma-medicine assists, while regulating diet—
Heaven and earth harmonize, all things are at peace;
Clothing and food are naturally regulated.
Drawing and adding water and fire without deficiency or excess,
Refining the divine elixir to radiate the nine palaces.

Expelling the ghostly corpse, pacifying the six roots,
Purifying and illuminating the eight consciousnesses—
The yin demons are expelled, the six spirits are at peace;
The auspicious light of the precious crucible illumines the great emptiness.
The eight scenes return as the eight-colored waters,
Forming cloud-script to emerge from Kunlun.

Emptying the five aggregates, rectifying the three primals—

The five desires purged, the five aggregates emptied,
Fivefold rosy clouds contend in radiant renewal.
The three palaces ascend and descend without end,
Steadily riding the golden dragon to the Jade Capital.

Attaining the Dao and becoming perfected,
Naturally ascending and transcending.
The golden elixir refined, long life is preserved;
The jade nature, crystalline, all dharmas are empty.

Attaining the Dao is as if not attaining,
Naturally ascending amid the nine heavens.

At that time, the assembled immortals of the heavens
Addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:
The immortals of the heavens each take refuge,
Gazing in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy, who purifies all delusions.
Clouds disperse, winds cease, the heavens gleam in stillness,
A single bright moon illumines the subtle and profound.

From beginningless time until this day,
Before the five primals divided from the primordial chaos,
All was indistinct, as if existent, as if not.
Through endless kalpas, enduring without loss or gain,
How could the surplus ever realize the surplusless?
Never before has such a Mahāyāna scripture been heard—
Seen yet unseen, heard yet soundless,
Neither form nor emptiness, beyond self and other.

Only for sentient beings attached to appearances
Does the teaching wind provisionally establish the three vehicles.
We, by this fortunate convergence, widely benefit all,
The fruit of the Dao perfected.
Unknowing the causes of past lives,
In this life we together encounter the transmission of the perfected.
Obstacles from beginningless karma all dissolve;
With merit complete and deeds fulfilled, we ascend to the nine heavens.

And they offered this hymn of praise:
In the profound and obscure, the Dao of purity,
From nonbeing arises the Dao of yin and yang,
The five phases inverted within and without.
Forgetting mind, forgetting dharma, forgetting form—
In the profound and obscure, the Dao of purity.
In the dim and silent, the great void unfolds.

Unbound, unstained, transcending harmony and union,
Sound and form untouched, all dharmas empty.
Grasping meaning, words forgotten, as if intoxicated—
In the dim and silent, the great void unfolds.
The essence and nature, profoundly still, abide nowhere;
Emotions and intentions extinguished, cares forgotten,
Wisdom’s light unstained by the slightest dust.
Through boundless kalpas, alone roaming free,
The essence and nature, profoundly still, abide nowhere.
Form and mind utterly quiescent, the one true source.

The true eye sweeps away the scenes of the dusty world,
The numinous terrace holds not a single hairbreadth.
Truly pure, truly still—the mystery within the mystery,
Form and mind utterly quiescent, the one true source.
