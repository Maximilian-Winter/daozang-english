**Fascicle One**

**Hymn to the Life-Bestowing Command of Jade Purity**
I bow my head to the Most High Lord of Jade Purity,
I bow my head to the Emperor of Golden Towers and the Void.
Encompassing creation, moving yin and yang,
In its ultimate state, naturally free from stagnation.
Giving birth to heaven, earth, and all beings,
Five-colored auspicious radiance follows wisdom everywhere.
Delivering countless beings beyond thought or measure,
I dare to rely on this auspicious light for salvation.
I surrender my life to the Venerable One in the Eastern Palace,
I surrender my life to the Saviors of the Ten Directions.
Subtle radiance pervades the three thousand worlds,
Wisdom silently penetrates the five gates of suffering.
Ever with vast and mighty divine power,
Compassionately saving the suffering and delivering the lost souls.
Guiding the lost from evil paths to return to the True,
The great Dharma Bridge of deliverance endures forever.

Holding the elixir, exhaling fragrance, illuminating the midnight and noon.
Refining and nurturing the numinous root so it never withers,
The ten thousand spirits gather, the host of yin beholds.

Opening the path for the Nine Dark Souls.
Orchid Palace links with the Purple Tenuity,
Following the pattern to ascend Vermilion Mound.
The Southern Palace holds wondrous youths,
Jade radiance refines my form.
Azure clouds float upon the green chariot,
Celebrating and revering the lofty honor.
Numinous winds ripple through cavernous echoes,
Precious and boundless, the ageless years.
Nine immortals bestow the registers of destiny,
Releasing and dispersing the roots of past karma.
Flying principles resist the empty Brahma,
Expansively attaining the nameless return.
The Great Chaos records the hundred bones,
Lingering mists merge with purple clouds.
Blessings descend to seven generations of descendants,
Misfortunes block the threefold sources of calamity.
Untying the sash to depart the dusty net,
Equal reins join the carefree guests.
In an instant, ascending the Dragon Terrace,
Bowing before the Jade Emperor.

**Second Scroll of Hymns and Eulogies of the Three Caverns**
**Applied Eulogies**
**Hymn to the Seven Perfected**

The Supreme Most Transcendent and Mysterious School,
Expounds the Dao and reveres its scriptures.
With a single bow and glance, one attains immortality,
Through countless kalpas, ageless years endure.
Majestic is the Great Sage’s virtue,
Silent and still, rooted in non-being.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
Riding the void in natural ascent.
Sun and moon blaze with brilliance,
Peace and harmony bring endless joy.
To learn immortality, sever worldly desires,
Each thought accumulates in succession.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restless, it traverses all without cease.
Extinguish thoughts within the void,
Whispering into silent emptiness.
Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
Hold resolve firm as metal and stone.
Preserve the path to flying immortality,
The Five Numinous Ones bestow registers of passage.
Fulfill my Six Perfections,
Thus dissolving the Three Nets.
In purity, worship the Primal Simplicity,
Exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-sprout.
Carefree within the Golden Gates,
Jade Capital becomes my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
Each person seated upon a lotus.
Gazing up, I chew the immortal fruits of Xuandu,
Bending down, I savor the hollow melons of the void.
Divine countenance shines like the crimson sun,
Why reckon the multitude of kalpas?
The dharma drum summons the assembly of immortals,
The tolling bell subdues the great demons.
A sacred breeze fans wondrous blossoms,
Resplendent, unfurling rich robes.
Heavenly Perfected strum the cloud zither,
All Perfected pluck the numinous harp.
Elegant songs of the Three Heavens’ radiance,
Scatter wisdom through the Jade Flower Grove.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessings,
Henceforth treading the mysterious tones.
If past-life blessings were insufficient,
This scripture remains distant and hard to find.
Sincerity in the Dao knows no end,
Yet those who plot flight may sink again.
The Supreme Dao of Non-Action,
Its vastness resides in the hearts of all.
To learn the Dao, trust in the cinnabar faith,
Revere your master as your closest kin.
Draw in the radiance to accompany pure splendor,
Diligently renewing with each passing day.
Though the multitudes may not attain deliverance,
Neither shall I be left undelivered.
Great vows demand profound recompense,
Mysterious virtue must surely be true.
Hidden virtue’s transgressions run deep,
Confronting them turns the wheel anew.
To learn the Dao is also most arduous,
Day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting blessings is like planting trees,
Heaped baskets form a mountain.
If you can immerse yourself in the mysterious and exalted,
You shall soar to the Pure Heavens.
Cultivate the Dao of Non-Action,
And you shall bind the great covenant.
The Supreme’s most recondite scripture,
Is called the *Chapter of Wisdom*.
To relieve suffering depends on one’s capacity,
Transcending the mundane to attain the Real.
A numinous countenance is no marvel in this world,
Like a lotus in the depths of an abyss.
Each person’s conduct has its root,
All stemming from past-life merit.
Establish virtue while the time is ripe,
Make vows, and none shall go unanswered.
Good and evil both await their retribution,
The principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,
Yet the Dao also lies in forgetting both.
To comprehend this is great wisdom,
Ascending to become the Venerable of the Supreme Ultimate.
Jewel canopies linked with jade pendants,
Commanding chariots drawn by nine dragons.
Golden blossoms hold the Cavern Scriptures,
Offering incense, cherishing the immortal youths.
Whistling songs resound through Xuandu,
Striking jade to chime the jeweled bells.
Rising to soar through the Great Clarity,
Transcending radiance, roaming the cloudy skies.
Upholding the Dharma’s words,
Wandering the mysterious ultimate in freedom.
Ten thousand kalpas are but last night,
A thousand autumns like the morning dawn.
Towering, shading the cloudy blossoms,
Hand grasping the branches of the Treasure Grove.
Incense smoke arises naturally,
The mysterious steps need no ascent.
Sacred banners disperse in due time,
Proliferating thoughts dissolve in their season.
Extinguish wisdom to expand the Great Chaos,
Non-Action becomes the pure hymn.

**Opening the Altar Hymn**
Vast and formless, the empty void,
Endless, moved by the utmost numen.
Reverence invokes Heaven’s favor,
Neglect invites demonic intrusion.
Fortune and misfortune turn with fate,
Adversity and prosperity arise from conditions.
The Dao does not prize pearls or jade,
The spirits respond only to utmost sincerity.
Redoubling devotion with diligence,
Praying earnestly with profound feeling.
Naturally, the Great Dao is attained,

Reliant on the Overseer’s descent to supervise.
Correcting faults while recording good deeds,
Even the Perfected Immortals revere and admire.
Soon the Daoist cavalcade will depart,
Vanishing into the depths of the five-colored clouds.
The living shall find support,
And the departed shall be delivered from darkness.

Their simurgh chariots pause in the purified space.
As the retreat nears its conclusion,
Their carriages return to the heavens above.
Their flowing grace knows no bounds,
How could it be merely for the fragrance of incense?

**Hymn to Send Forth the Scripture Master**
Though the scriptural Dharma is subtle and wondrous,
Its reverence depends entirely on the master.
All who establish goodness,
Frequently pay homage to him.
When qi flows, merit is easily achieved;
When the heart is negligent, regret comes too late.
If one can diligently maintain mindfulness,
Morning and evening, one will naturally soar as an immortal.

**Hymn to Send Forth the Register Master**
The Dao holds the retreat in highest esteem,
The Dharma regards audience as constant practice.
Those who neither cultivate nor uphold it,
How can they reach the Celestial Realm?

Naturally opening the Purple Chamber.
The Dark Warrior arrays his numinous chariot,
And one beholds the Golden Palace Hall.

A hundred evils crumble and fall,
Ten thousand ghosts retreat in fear.
Bright radiance shines through all,
Communing with the true and numinous.
The Most High scatters light in every direction,
Vermilion lamps convey sincerity.
All heavens are fully illumined,
All earthly realms grow bright and clear.
My body, too, shines with light,
My five viscera blossom with splendor.
Scorching sunlight ascends the Great Void,
Distant thoughts reach the Jade Capital.
Cinnabar essence abides in the Supreme Origin,
Mysterious yang resounds in the empty sky.
Greed’s form severs the root of suffering,
Subtle and wondrous, the true thought arises.
Hanging blossoms bear no fruit,
Causes and conditions forever formless.
My body is likewise,
Riding transformation, borne by flowing light.
The night’s glow marks the Cinnabar Yang,
Far and distant, it illumines the void.
All heavens beam with radiant countenances,
All yin shadows instantly dissolve.
My spirit, too, grows keen and bright,

Night’s torch dries the flowing essence.

The Two Perfected of Sun and Moon
Merge as one within me.

**Hymn of Wisdom**
Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts,
The true Dao takes precepts as its master.
From this, the Three Treasures flourish,
Revered and received by lofty immortals.
Sailing this deathless vessel,
Swiftly one crosses the vast expanse.
At this moment of expounding precepts,
All heavens come to bow their heads.
Wisdom arises from original non-being,
Brightly illuminating the ten directions.
Binding emptiness, it towers in the mystic firmament,
All heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its wonder defies thought and speech,
Its numinous resonance truly and subtly pervades.
Being culminates in non-being,
Non-being contains all without exception.
Wisdom constantly observes the body,
The foremost task in learning the Dao.
Vast and boundless, it roams freely,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever protects and shelters,
The Demon King pledges his guardianship.
Resplendent is the Vajra body,
Transcendent, the Most High immortal.

**Hymn of Upholding the Precepts**
The Dao takes non-mind as its essence,
All acts become fields of merit.
Establishing merit has no fixed measure,
Each follows their original vow.
Emptying oneself to respond to beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage exalts the true teaching,
Just as rain descends from heaven.
Lofty and towering, none are left untouched,
Ever humble, thus forming the abyss.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it can relinquish the dragon’s scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved,
How could it be limited to this lifetime?
Upholding precepts without the slightest lapse,
Lifetimes of good karmic bonds are formed.
Concentrate thought on the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the Dao’s truth.

The Heavenly Worthy, vast in compassion,
Expounds the precepts to deliver beings.
Majestic virtue pervades the hidden and manifest,
Karmic retribution moves the true numina.
All heavens come to bow their heads,
All demons restrain their forms.
The past transcends the Eight Difficulties,
The present safeguards a thousand years.
When the merit of the retreat is complete,
Together we send forth our reverence.
Flowing Sanskrit, ethereal cloud-chants,
Flying incense mingles with fragrant smoke.
Jade phoenixes ride cinnabar carriages,
Golden dragons draw emerald chariots.
In life and death, all find joy,
Families and nations all know peace.

**Hymn of Burning Incense**
In learning the Dao, be diligent and earnest,
Gather faith and circulate cinnabar sincerity.
Burn incense and take refuge in the Most High,
True qi blends with fragrant smoke.
May it open the great pardon,
Freeing the seven ancestors from dark realms.

**Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate**
The Dao takes purification as foremost,
Diligent practice ascends the Golden Portal.
Thus is the great Dharma bridge established,
Universally delivering all beings.
Repaying the kindness of past lives,
The heart of the Dao arises transcendent.
The body soars to the immortal capital,
The seven ancestors all attain liberation.

**Hymn of Presenting the Petition**
The Most High’s Dharma is subtle and wondrous,
Petitions and registers deliver humans and heavens.
The Primordial Beginning announces the talismanic decree,
At the appointed hour, one attains ascension.
Transmission saves the drowning,
All achieve self-cultivation.
Inscribing names on the Golden Petition,
Carefree before the Jade Emperor.

**Hymn of the Deliverance Petition**
Vermilion brightness unfolds the mystic chart,
Harmonious and smooth, it reaches the upper void.
The Primordial Beginning spreads the numinous scripture,
Ten divisions of flying celestial texts.
Opening deliverance for the nine dark ancestors,
A myriad recitations, the Dao naturally abides.
Jade peaks adorn the jeweled forest,
Life and death dwell in the abode of merit and virtue.
Without the Yellow Register Petition,
How could the root of suffering be severed?
Circumambulating, reciting the numinous scripture,
The Five Numinous Ones return to assist.

**Hymn of Burning the Petition**
Beings abound in obstacles and hardships,
The Great Dao truly pities and cherishes them.
Deliverance extends through ritual teachings,
All are enabled to repent their karmic bonds.
Transgressions fill the earthly prisons,
Offenses have reached the heavens.
Revealing them, I pray for true protection,
With a hidden heart, I move the sages.
Reverently bowing to the Three Treasures,
May I soon ascend to heaven and enjoy long years.
Burning the petition, I return it to the upper realms,
Presenting names before the Jade Emperor.

**Hymn of Burning the Memorial**
Sacred virtue flows through ritual teachings,
Cultivating the retreat brings long life and fortune.
Extending life by transferring the Jade Petition,
Requesting destiny by presenting the Golden Scroll.

Living registers are inscribed in the Southern Prosperity.
The living all find joy,
The departed are born in the land of fortune.

**Hymn of Welcoming the Perfected**
The Heavenly Worthy mounts the celestial dragon,
A million immortals ride as his retinue.

Bestowing blessings upon all beings.

Gazing afar at the immortal path,
Carefree, they ascend the Great Loftiness.

**Hymn of Sending Forth the Direct Petition Messenger**
I reverently invoke the Direct Petition Messenger,
Hidden and manifest paths secretly connect.
Riding clouds, hastening to present the casket,
Far traversing the Three Realms.
The Purple Clarity and Golden Portal are profound,
The Mystic Metropolis and Water Palace abide.
Transmission is swift as a moment,
The upright petition awaits the true wind.

**Hymn of Universal Offering**
Universally offering to the boundless sages,
Fragrant smoke scatters in the ten directions.
May they ascend the Seven Treasures Terrace,
Shedding light upon the Five Turbid Worlds.
Delivering the hosts of humans and heavens,
All are enabled to mount the Dharma bridge.
Together we realize non-action,
Diligently cultivating without retreat.

**Hymn of the Northern Emperor**
Excellent is the Primordial Beginning, the Venerable One,
The compassionate father and mother of all beings.
Inclining his light from the Purple Tenuity Palace,
Bending to illuminate the nine dark portals.
Towering is the cold courtyard of Mount Qiu,
Its reflection expands the icy shores.
Fiery flames rage in the scorching hells,
Abundantly he showers the Dharma rain.
All-pervading, his great compassion and wisdom,
Ever skillfully relieving the suffering of the multitude.

**Deliverance of Long-Night Souls**
Now delivered from the endless night, they bow in reverence.

**Hymn of Huaxia**
Diligently observing fasts and precepts,
Reciting scriptures to restrain the six passions.
Thus they ride the void and soar,
Radiant, ascending to Jade Clarity.
With focused heart they keep the fasts,
Exhaling and inhaling to refine the five spirits.
Inner virtue crowns the heavens,
Turning the wheel to become perfected immortals.

**Hymn of Dao-Seekers**
To seek the Dao, action is urgent;
To uphold precepts is to master the heart.
In emptiness and equanimity, the true *qi* abides,
Where immortals and sages naturally converge.
If one does not trust the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in mountain forests?

**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected**
Divine clouds gleam in layered void,
Brahmic nets gather in azure skies.
The Primordial Beginning’s nine dragons draw the chariot,
The August One reins the azure carriage.
Luminous radiance gathers the myriad perfected,
Pearl-like reflections open the vastness of Yang Lea.
Revealing the *Lingbao* scriptures,
Fortune and virtue are thereby summoned.
The Cavernous Mystery conceals lofty majesty,
Jade tones ripple like cloud-borne zithers.
Boundless as the primordial measure,
The Dao’s sea stirs with waves.
Dharma principles flow like rivulets,
Nurturing fine sprouts to grow.
Used to relieve the hungry and destitute,
Teachings flourish to guard the central court.
May the August Lord live for myriad years,
Peace prevail, and weapons be stilled.
Bowing in reverence toward the Jade Dawn,
Divine blossoms scatter from golden rays.
Though the Great Dao is without intent,
It may be sought with devotion.
Benevolence rides the empty vastness,
Gazing back upon the veiled azure currents.
Beyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,
One roams the ethereal Jade Capital.
Without the mysterious impetus of fate,
Who could fathom the hidden depths?
Vast and clear, the Celestial Han,
Looking up and down, one finds emptiness and softness.
The Seven Mysteries disperse the dark descendants,
Returning to the womb, flowing with sinking and rising.
If the hidden term silently congeals,
The Yang’s nine calamities hold no fear.
Beholding these goings and comings,
Time and again one lingers.
Externally forsaking the body, yet the body endures—
True immortals meet with worthy companions.
Vigorous is the mystery within,
Serene are the waves of the clear Han.
Change and decay turn like a wheel,
Yet the camphor tree’s branches remain unchanged.
With tranquil heart, contemplate the Perfected,
Following fate’s course through separation and union.
Resonance and response are ever connected,
Spiritual awareness reaches its own origin.
Wandering in simplicity, without bounds,
Prolific thoughts penetrate the nine rosy clouds.
Flying roots scatter dark leaves,
Principle returns—nothing else.
Ever reciting jade verses,
Mysterious tones pierce the distant skies.
When the *jiashen* flood disaster struck,
I soared on wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.
Forever enjoying boundless eternity,
Who knows the multitude of kalpas?

**Hymn of the Golden Register for Delivering Lives and Redeeming Sins from the Nine Dark Realms**
Bowing in reverence to the Supreme Dao,
My heart returns to the Primordial Venerable One.
The Perfect and Wondrous Responsive Lord,
Opens and transforms the soaring Mystery Gate.
Wondrous precepts gladden the five spirits,
Golden scriptures admonish the myriad deities.
Examining fate, the registers are fixed,
Divine talismans deliver suffering souls.
Riding clouds to attend the Jade Emperor,
In harmony with those of the Mystery Center.
**Hymn of Redeeming Karmic Entanglements**
Great is the Lord of the Dao,
Ever universally bestowing boundless merit.
A boat and oars upon the sea of birth and death,
Ferrying across to transcend Fengdu’s nether realms.
Karmic retribution no longer encountered,
Blessings connect with the unseen.
How could the workings of the divine be fathomed?
Praise cannot exhaust them.

**Hymn of Merit for Rebirth**
Cool and sweet, the nectar nourishes,
The Dharma’s flavor beyond thought.
Incense wafts to the Seven Perfected,
How could doubt arise in the unseen?
Those who receive this Dharma food,
Ascend to heaven, enter the Purple Tenuity.
The field of merit lofty and towering,
Offerings and alms bring purity.
All conditioned deeds,
Universally fulfill karmic destiny.
Delivering you from the three wretched paths’ suffering,
Bestowing the nine mysteries’ blessings.
When the time comes to receive this food,
All heavens join in praise.
The cold courtyard holds much sorrow,
Turning hearts to bow to the Primordial August.
The Talisman of the Divine Treasure of Lady Blue,
The True Scripture of the Central Mountain Emperor.
One thought ascends to Grand Clarity,
A second thought returns to the Supreme Void.
Merit accrues below the nine dark realms,
Swiftly reborn in the Purple Tenuity.

**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected Administering the Cavernous Mystery Scripture**
The eight paths converge without origin,
Riding fate to observe the clamorous net.
Transforming and removing the dust of the world,
Loosening the collar, one finds the Daoist family.
In an instant of wafting smoke,
Bearing truth, one arrives at the numinous peak.
Gazing upon the jade pavilion in the void,
The mysterious harmony composes phoenix songs.
The path is free from hindrance,
Divine tones dance upon cloud waves.
Equal in virtue with the jadelike capital,
Why cling to worldly abundance?
Left hand grasping the jade parasol,
Flying at dawn, treading the Seven Origins.
The Three Luminaries gleam with purple radiance,
Rising to gaze upon the Bright Perfected.
In a moment of leaping transformation,
All four directions become divine.
The numinous scripture knows no bounds,
Diligently ponder the *Shangqing* texts.
Why remain mired in the crossroads,
Causing your devotion to waver?
Yin ailments lose their mysterious mechanism,
Unnoticed, the years divide.
Mysterious waves stir the azure tides,
Vast currents surge through myriad streams.
Riding the radiance, gazing upon the six voids,
Longing to wander with the Perfected.
Exquisite songs do not answer me,
Clear tones find no one to receive them.
Amid clouds, driving jade wheels,
Who would be a companion in dust and earth?

**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected**
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao,
Reveals the *Lingbao* scriptures.
Lofty and wondrous, beyond comparison,
Like the mystery within mystery.
The ten directions’ lands naturally
Revere the Supreme Immortals.
Vast is the *Dongxu* scripture,
Seated in peace, attending the heavens.
Above, the Purple Tenuity Terrace,
Below, the myriad famous mountains.
Resplendent with dragon and phoenix patterns,
Their brilliance stored within.
Wondrous is the Most High Dao,
Non-action, ever natural.
Kings, lords, and common folk,
Value only the worthy.
Those with karmic fortune and blessings,
Stand out from the past’s verdant fields.
Dharma masters transmit to one another,
Precious faith enduring kalpas.
With broad heart, deliver all,
Great fortune will be yours.
Those who make offerings will attain the Dao,
Those who uphold it become perfected.
The Great Dao has no self or other,
Transmission finds the Perfected.

**Hymn of the First Perfected of the Mysterious Unity**
Myriad wonders emerge from the Cavernous Truth,
Resplendent, illuminating Grand Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
Embodying the origin, they live forever.
Carefree, they play in the mysterious void,
Palaces array their forms.
Lush and radiant, the seven-jeweled grove,
Gleaming with the essence of sun and moon.
Dragons and unicorns gallop to and fro,
Phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Most High governs the Purple Terrace,
The myriad perfected recite the Cavernous scriptures.
Holding incense, bowing in reverence,
Circumambulating the palace city.
Three circuits return to the high seat,
The Dao King responds with his voice.
When the ruler promotes the Perfect Dao,
The world universally attains peace.

**Hymn of the Second Perfected of the Mysterious Unity**
Emptiness and nothingness, ever natural,
Forcibly named the Great Dao.
[...] vast, without bounds,
Myriad wonders return to the *Lingbao*.

**Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Mysterious Unity**
With eyes closed, meditate upon the Most Real,
In deep concentration, summon the Ten Elders.
Ascending as immortals, forever free from action,
Their numinous countenances ever wondrous and fair.
Thirst quenched by the nectar of Jade Pool,
Hunger sated by the Golden Flower herb.
They purify the world, delivering from the Eight Perils,
Relieving all worldly sufferings and afflictions.

**Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Mysterious Unity**
Wondrous indeed, the *Lingbao* scriptures,
The Most High’s spontaneous writings.
Those who uphold them attain the Dao,
Proclaimed as perfected beings descending into the world.
Entrusted to propagate the Daoist teachings,
Truly they transcend the mundane.
Their tasks complete, they ascend as immortals,
Their palaces governing the Mysterious Terrace.
At times descending upon Kunlun Mountain,
Carefree, they rest in Penglai.

**Hymn to Master Zhang**
The *Lingbao* and the Great Cavern,
Supreme scriptures of the Perfect Dao.
Only the Five Thousand Characters,
Lofty and wondrous, without equal.
Those who practice them ascend as immortals,
Dwelling in the void, governing the ethereal.
Attending the Terrace of the Most High,
Carefree in the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like a flash of lightning,
Yet they endure forever, without end.
The Dao-eye now fully opened,
Vast and luminous, naturally penetrating the obscure.
The hidden and dim—none unknown,
Seated in stillness, they behold the ten directions.

**Hymn of the Threefold Invocation**
Delighting in the Dharma as one’s wife,
Cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Holding the precepts to restrain the six senses,
Contemplating the Dao to dispel desires.
In purity, the upright qi abides,
In serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes of great blessings enjoyed.
Flourishing are families and nations,
Prosperous are the scriptures and the Dao.
Heaven and humanity share the same aspiration,
Ethereally entering the Great Vehicle.
Cultivating the field of merit in the mind,
The Dharma-wheel ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
While this body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void,
With mindfulness, nothing fails to align.
Refining the body into immortal perfection,
Thus attaining the adamantine form.
Transcending the Three Realms’ tribulations,
Liberating from the Five Sufferings of hell.
All return to the scriptures of the Most High,
In tranquil contemplation, bowing in reverence.

**Hymn in Praise of the Dao’s Manifestation**
The Dao of heaven responds to the times,
Yin and yang are most numinous.
Discerning their subtle mechanisms,
One may preserve or lose the body.
Awakened, one becomes supreme;
Deluded, one is not real.
**Hymn in Praise of the Dharma’s Exposition**
Heaven and earth, the myriad things,
Yin and yang, the four seasons.
Mutually overcoming one another,
Yet noble is he who harmonizes with heaven’s mechanism.
The sagely work is spiritually efficacious,
None but the worthy can comprehend.
Thus, one lightly values life,
Carefully examining what is fitting.

**Hymn in Praise of the Arts’ Exposition**
Cutting off profit at its source,
Thrice reflecting, then acting.
Yielding to things’ mechanisms,
Life and death lie before one’s eyes.
Joy arises from tranquility,
Kindness begets cruel harm.
Heaven and earth’s calamities and blessings,
Timely principles bring fortune.

**Hymn to the Scripture of Purity and Stillness**
The Five Ultimates take primacy,
The void and nothingness are the Dao’s spontaneity.
The Primordial Origin governs the ancestral norm,
Its wondrous essence harmonizes with the mysterious and profound.
Expounding the teachings to clarify the Supreme,
Understanding constancy through metaphorical explication.
Through this pure and still virtue,
The scriptures are established to propagate transformation.

The Great Dao conceals itself in form,
True essence blends into the obscure.
The Two Modes divide at the first sign,
A single qi circulates without cease.
Encompassing and sustaining—truly unfathomable,
Nurturing and generating—oh, how serene!
Fashioning and shaping, the Artisan of things,
All creatures, though dull, contain the numinous.
Sun and moon traverse the void,
Bright and luminous, most impartial.
Those who attain heaven endure in radiance,
Illuminating all things, universally penetrating.
Tangible things receive light’s illumination,
Insentient beings merge with form’s fusion.
Yin and yang constantly embody the Dao,
Unceasing within the Great Vastness.

The wondrous Dao is truly hard to name,
Yet it embraces and generates the myriad things.
Circulating through time, it fills the earth’s veins,
Freely bestowed, it receives heaven’s clarity.
Breathing forth the true message,
The Great Transformation achieves harmony.
Returning to oneness in perfect communion,
High and low lie level and even.
Formless, utterly without trace,
Hard to name within the primordial chaos.
Before the emergence of heaven, earth, and sun,
How could there be rain, clouds, or wind?
Breaking open the signs of the primordial chaos,
Piercing through the obscurity of things’ forms.
Thereby dividing and creating,
Provisionally establishing the boundless Dao.
The clear and turbid qi of yin and yang,
Circulating, surging above and below.
Naturally accomplishing transformation,
Ultimately harmonizing in perfect communion.
The myriad kinds nurtured and reared,
The Three Origins conjoined in unity.
Heaven and earth in harmonious union,
All gathered in the One True Emptiness.

At the inception, the Two Modes divided,
Humanity and the numinous—most noble and revered.
The Three Powers stabilize the cosmos,
The Two Forces determine heaven and earth.
All things contain the true qi,
The primordial is the gateway to true reality.
Hard and soft mutually complement in function,
Who can abide in embodying the Dao?
Descending to the root, one penetrates the true body,
Returning to the origin, one perceives the end’s cause.
Spring’s yang spreads luxuriant flourishing,
Autumn’s season governs withering and decline.
The Supreme Ultimate generates form and transformation,
In pure harmony, it renews creation.
The pivot of the great mechanism propels the great movement,
Entrusted to the divine, it accomplishes its work.
The principle of purity and stillness is profound,
Who can fathom its ultimate depths?

Beholding emptiness, one eliminates all realms,
Cutting off forms, one comprehends all minds.
The moon of wisdom flows in the cinnabar river,
The cloud of compassion covers the emerald peaks.
Abiding in stillness, one remains unmoved,
Responding to things, one manifests as a knowing friend.
When one awakens to constant purity and stillness,
One knows the wondrous mechanism of the sagely origin.
The Great Beginning is free from defilement,
In perfect quiescence, its radiance concealed.
Silently, it enfolds the sand-realm,
Dimly, it penetrates the Purple Tenuity.
After the Three Origins’ ascent and descent,
Heaven and earth all return to it.

The mind is the numinous abode,
The spirit rests in stillness, finding peace.
Greed, anger, and delusion easily arise,
Precepts, concentration, and wisdom are hard to behold.
The profound essentials lie in perfect uprightness,
Firmly maintaining inner tranquility.
Ever free from the six desires,
The Dharma-realm naturally expands.
If one dispels all passions and desires,
The mind becomes clear, wondrously penetrating all.
In unity with the real, not clinging to things,
Returning to stillness, abandoning all attachments.

Water, distant, connects to heaven in stillness,
Mountains, high, wear the moon’s chill.
In perfect communion, wisdom is all-penetrating,
Within the pot, the golden pellet revolves.
Right mindfulness is without bias,
In emptiness, it harmonizes with spontaneity.
The six senses’ dust instantly ceases,
The three poisons’ afflictions must be healed.
The wondrous Dao transcends kalpas of emptiness,
Preserving the spirit, one ascends to heaven.
In this subtle and mysterious place,
The Mysterious Female naturally endures.
Losing the way, one strays from home,
All because one’s own light is obscured.
The mind, floating, is easily moved,
Familiar realms are hard to forget.
How can one dispel the defilements of desire?
Devious cunning only leads to desolation.
Turning the head, one finds the place of awakening,
Reflecting inward, one beholds the King of Emptiness.
Awakened to all the leaks of dust,
The Dao-eye opens clearly.
Forms and sounds are not obstacles,
Knowledge and perception must be buried.
When the spirit is still, a thousand calamities vanish,
When the mind is empty, ten thousand cares turn to ash.
The pure wind passes through the jade door,
Naturally, sweet sounds arrive.

Beholding all forms as non-form,
Their essence is but a kind of nothingness.

Within lies the true Dharma-realm,
Its essence merges with the Great Void.
Clouds still, the toad’s light reveals,
The pool so clear, white silk unfurls.

Such manifest signs—where seek another path?
In silent illumination, all things observed:
How could the myriad spirits differ?
In shared truth, none can be seen,
Beyond all traces, none can imitate.

The elder in the hall, clear and bright,
Rests beyond all dharma—nothing more.
Mysterious, mysterious, mystery dissolved,
The eight directions stretch unbounded.
The vast expanse of true emptiness revealed,
Looking back—no single thing remains.

Fused as the great desert,
Profoundly still, its nature is void.
Luminous and ever-silent,
Perfectly penetrating, its nature flows free.
Within and without as one,
Not returning to the primal origin.

When the mind is empty of things,
Even "nothingness" is truly nothing.
Why labor to dispel delusion?
What need to discern fine from coarse?

From stillness and emptiness, skill arises,
Returning to truth, unwavering.
Such subtle messages—who dares name or shape them?
All dharmas are inherently empty,
"Nothingness" and "nothingness" unite in sacred work.

Profoundly serene, neither within nor without,
Silent, east and west dissolve.
Where mind and realm both forgotten,
Square and round become one.

Vast and obscure, beyond creation,
All things freely pass through.
Provisional stillness serves as body,
Yet one must still remove the roots of desire.
When conditions are forgotten, thus stilled,
True stillness renews itself.

Accord with the unborn dharma,
Only then does one know the spring of endless day.
Alone transcending heaven and earth,
Freely at ease, unbounded.
Once settled, one reaches true constancy,
The spirit’s light beyond all measure.

Illuminating the chamber of the three poisons,
Piercing the halls of the five luminaries.
The jewel moon shines in the clear sky,
Deluded clouds vanish in an instant.
The pure wind spreads its message,
Responding to things, it unfolds at will.

Through endless kalpas, ever perfected,
Neither darkness nor light.
The Valley Spirit remains eternally still,
The Dharma-ocean serene and clear.

Right mindfulness enters the true path,
A settled mind attains the wondrous course.
Forever freed from the bonds of birth and death,
The three realms stretch wide for wandering.

Having stilled sound and trace,
Deeply penetrating the profound principle:
True emptiness—can it be attained?
True form requires no cultivation.

Let eating and pecking pass as they may,
Dignity and conduct follow freely.
Suddenly, all deliberation ceases,
In tranquility, wholeness is preserved.

To awaken the transformation of beings,
All manifold pursuits must be relinquished.
Instantly transcending the fruit of no-leakage,
How could there be any root or cause?

Grasping and rejecting cannot move it,
Causes and conditions too are cut off.
In a flash, all is let go—
The sacred path may then be transmitted.

The superior person knows no contention,
Diligently and constantly holds firm resolve.
Dwelling in truth, ever at ease,
Cultivating simplicity, hidden in profound mystery.

Looking up and down, observing heaven’s principle,
Through prosperity and adversity, penetrating the depths of the Dao.
Alas for those who remain unenlightened,
Competing in dharmas, their minds obscured.

Virtue’s transformation seeks no reward,
Grace is wide—how could one be proud?
Concealing one’s light, treasuring great capacity,
The bright nature shines like solid ice.

Silently in accord with the high and distant,
Deeply penetrating the vastness of the supreme Dao.
How could it resemble the foolish who cling,
Forcing distinctions, boasting of their abilities?

Most beings turn from the Dao,
Inverted, seeking outside.
Delusion arises from this,
The true spirit obscured and lost.

Originally lacking nothing,
Why forcefully cling to cultivation?
With a sudden sweep, the clouds of delusion disperse,
The silver toad shines upon the jade tower.

Scheming arises from delusion,
Departing from truth disturbs the spirit.
All because the mind harbors love and desire,
Attaching to things, giving rise to greed and anger.

Ever harboring the fire of ignorance,
Adding the dust of affliction.
From this, retribution is received,
Revolving through the six paths in suffering.

From delusion arise anger and desire,
Greed and ignorance become obstacles.
Sorrow and worry bind endlessly,
Afflictions coil without cease.

Thus the true Dao is obscured,
From this, karmic transgressions arise.
Turning the light inward in reflection,
One awakens to the wondrous within.

Afflictions arise from thoughts—
When has one ever awakened to one’s own mind?
Vast and confused, suffering humiliation,
Disturbed and restless, unwilling to reflect.

Dying in vain without respite,
Living emptily until now.
Thus the true Dao is lost,
Dreams and illusions encroach.

If one connects with heaven and earth,
All are sustained by the Dao’s qi.
Hiding the root, deepening the stem,
Extinguishing the poisons, returning the hun to peace.

Having awakened to the path of long life,
One must open the gate of enduring vision.
Preserving truth, the spirit transforms itself,
The supreme Dharma King is revered.

**The Three Caverns’ Hymns of Praise, Scroll the Middle**
**The Three Caverns’ Hymns of Praise, Scroll the Lower**
**The Three Contracts’ Hymns**

The Primordial Cavern of Empty Nothingness,
The three qi refine the upper gate.
Purple radiance illumines the Great Void,
The four luminaries plant the spiritual root.

Wondrous transformation arises in the eastern jade,
The three conveniences open the western Kunlun.
Resplendent, shining upon the nine mysteries,
The five flowers adorn the brocade clouds.

The net of separation gleams with the divine lamp,
The seven stars illuminate the northern origin.
Soaring, soaring to the upper clear realms,
Winged, winged—the Emperor Unity is revered.

Lofty, lofty the supreme hymn,
How the feathered youths swarm!
Flowing fragrance, originally without color,
Penetrating the myriad immortals’ throng.

To the left, circling the three kalpas,
To the right, conveying the ten thousand heavens’ gates.
Cloud flowers entwine the jade clouds,
The eight phoenixes dance in empty turns.

The four seasons never cease their mechanism,
Blue and white are early distinguished.
Nine nines transform the kalpa’s fate,
Three threes pass through one cosmic cycle.

Heaven and earth have their final meeting,
Yin and yang return to the banner.
The Cavern’s clarity of the Orthodox Unity,
The solemn end of the six celestial texts.

Great peace reverts to empty nothingness,
Serving the later sagely lord.
The divine wind rises from the western gate,
Brocade clouds arise in the eastern jade.

The two qi illumine the jade isles,
Flowing fragrance rides the light smoke.
The five flowers scatter in the wind,
Suddenly brightening the nine clear realms.

The soaring forest glows with the vermilion sun,
Yellow flowers follow the moon’s birth.
Within, the herb-gathering youths,
Clothed in feathers, girded with flying green.

The swift light of ten thousand peaks,
Freely at ease, feasting in the green chariot.
Mastering the nine empty conveyances,
Opening the boundless course.

To the left, commanding the three celestial texts,
To the right, seizing the six celestial soldiers.
Regulating qi, returning to empty caverns,
Heaven’s measures respond to the turning fate.

Kalpas have their own meetings—
Who can fathom defeat or success?
Vast waves engulf the cosmic net,
The six directions leave no form behind.

White corpses drift in the long flow,
Lonely souls scatter and vanish.
Grieving this cycle of departure and return,
Only then does one perceive the brightness of the true Dharma.

With utmost study and refined cultivation,
Binding jade blossoms to form a precious name.
Rejoicing in those of the white tally,
Together delighting in great peace.

The cavern’s gate turns heaven’s net,
The five qi revolve the three subtleties.
The purple portal emits jade tallies,
The golden gate receives the divine radiance.

Eight Gatherings merge with the true wind,
Radiant and bright, the layered darkness unfurls.
Beyond the Nine Pures at heaven’s edge,
Lofty and vast, the high morn returns.

Three hues revert to empty nothingness,
Four seasons respond to the jade precincts.
The River Earl has already raised his brush,
Five phases silently propel one another.

Six Perfections span endless kalpas,
When fate is exhausted, one rides qi to return.
Myriad demons spread across the heavens,
Hordes of fiends vie to display their might.

Multitudes bear the brunt of calamity,
Piles of corpses evoke sorrow.
Wondrous indeed is the scripture of the true Dharma,
Through kalpas it shines, undiminished in clarity.

At the destined hour, they shall be welcomed,
Their bond lies at the gate of the Nine Heavens.
With you I pledge great peace,
Releasing the self to soar without wings.

Wondrous indeed is the resonance of the Three Caverns,
Vast and echoing—how clear the chime!
Seeking the sound, it seems both present and absent,
Moved yet unseen in form.

The echoing tone pervades the ten directions,
Yet when heard, no sound remains.
The great Dao must enter the vast,
The wandering mind returns to the Great Void.

At dawn, pay homage across the ten directions,
Ascend and transcend upon the Nine Dragons.
Soaring beyond the Three Realms,
One rises as if amid clouds.

My master is the Heavenly Venerable,
Transcendent, the Supreme Emperor.
Gazing upward beyond the earth’s bounds,
Dimly one glimpses the Purple Flame Hall.

Towering is the Chamber of the Mysterious Capital,
Where only the abodes of immortals are seen.

---

*The Great Cavern Scripture in Praise*
The Great Cavern True Scripture is of the Great Vehicle,
Profound and abstruse, reaching the utmost mystery.
All immortals and sages of the ten directions and three times,
Through cultivation and mastery, attain the Primordial Azure.

The Three Caverns and Three Vehicles are not easily fathomed,
The Jade Emperor’s wondrous words are flawless.
All scriptures and myriad dharmas return to the ancestral source,
Through comprehension, one ascends to the realm of kalpas.

Emperors, ministers, dukes, and lords,
Governors, officials, and common folk—
Wealth, honor, and glory are no different,
All converge in the Great Cavern to fathom the profound plan.

The black-robed and yellow-robed teachings may differ in path,
Yet scholars who hear rites and recite poems are noble.
All may chant and uphold the True Great Cavern,
Primordial Heaven and Earth—one vast emptiness.

Those who study the Complete Perfection and Dao,
Through myriad methods and thousand gates, waste their minds.
Chanting the Great Cavern Scripture ten thousand times,
The Jade Emperor and Laozi become their true kin.

Scholars, warriors, and officials,
Courtesans, commoners, and all alike—
All may follow their hearts to hold the Great Cavern,
Severing karmic roots to wander with the gods.

The Great Cavern’s true essence differs from other scriptures,
Ascending as immortals, entering as sages, to meet the Mysterious Perfected.
Through countless kalpas as numerous as dust motes,
One fully realizes the Jade Emperor as the Supreme Person.

Alas, the foolish and unenlightened,
How could they recognize the pearl of Fuli’s millet?
The Great Cavern delivers all as one body,
Effortlessly ascending to the Mysterious Capital.

If one wishes to cultivate and reach the Supreme Vehicle,
How can it compare to the few chapters of the Great Cavern?
Exhausting heart and nature to refine the body’s method,
Through realization, one ascends to the Great Abundance Court.

For the sake of all disciples, I carve this scripture,
Composing hymns to praise and extol it.
Its merit is towering, an inexhaustible treasury,
The Jade Emperor’s wondrous Dao is originally formless.

---

*Hymn of the Primordial Heavenly Emperor*
From the beginning, the sounds of Canghu and Tanchi,
Formed cloud-seals to deliver heaven and humanity.
The Great Mystery’s Dao Father sought and received it,
Only then was the Great Cavern Scripture heard below.

Common folk of the earth seek to awaken to truth,
The path to the immortal source is distant and hard to find.
If one wishes to know the swift and unerring way,
Recite with the mouth and hold in the heart the Great Cavern Scripture.

Ancestral merits from past lives were slight,
Thus this life’s blessings and descendants are meager.
If one prays to attain one’s desires,
How can it compare to diligently studying the Great Cavern Scripture?

Sun and moon lose their light, suffering engulfment,
Stars and constellations fall into disarray, disrupting celestial patterns.
To dispel heaven’s calamities and pacify the common folk,
The wise together proclaim the Great Cavern Scripture.

Drought demons bring disaster, rain falls like metal,
Locusts, floods—no harvest is reaped.
To universally ensure abundance without famine,
Prayers rely entirely on the Great Cavern Scripture.

Merchants, artisans, farmers, and traders—all four classes,
Greedily seeking, unaware of karma clinging to them.
Amid busyness, spare a moment’s mind and strength,
To recite the Wenchang Great Cavern Scripture.

Treasuries overflow with wealth,
Weapons forever stilled in peaceful ascent.
The people sing of virtuous governance, longing for stability,
In gratitude, diligently study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Earthly deities, spirits, and all numina,
Seeking promotion yet lacking cause—
To advance in the register of good deeds and amplify power,
At dusk, one must heed the Great Cavern Scripture.

Kinsfolk, ancestors, and parents’ souls,
Long detained in the underworld, unable to ascend—
If one wishes to deliver them yet lacks the means,
Observe fasts and diligently study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Lawsuits and summons burden descendants,
Divine reprimands weigh upon the heavenly court.
Through generations, misfortunes linger—
To resolve them, one should study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Whether building or constructing tombs,
Breaking ground may offend malevolent spirits.
Causing one’s dwelling to suffer misfortunes—
To pacify them, one should hold the Great Cavern Scripture.

The Yearly King of Epidemics governs the Five Pests,
Spreading through states and villages, harming the people.
To protect one’s neighbors from contagion,
Maintain purity and together study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Monthly and yearly calamities long afflict the body,
Seeking doctors, divination, and gods—
Unable to escape, with no recourse—
Entrust one’s fate to the Great Cavern Scripture.

Six kinds of karmic foes—male and female souls,
Dim and obscure in the netherworld’s gloom—
To universally refine and ascend to heavenly realms,
Often study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Karmic enemies of the Six Paths are deeply entangled,
Vengeance upon vengeance—when will it end?
If one wishes each to rejoice,
Only through hearing the Great Cavern Scripture.

Whether over wealth or wrath,
In a moment of fury, one invokes the gods—
Forming ghostly lawsuits, when will they cease?
Only the Great Cavern Scripture can dissolve them.

Illness, death, and loss never leave the body,
Official misfortunes, bandits, and suffering press in.
Wealth dissipates, possessions scatter like ice and snow—
For protection, one should hold the Great Cavern Scripture.

Wood, stone, fox, monkey, and dog spirits,
Hurling bricks, setting fires, appearing in human form—
Exerting power, seeking lewd sacrifices—
To eradicate them, study the Great Cavern Scripture.

Dwelling in mountains, forests, or secluded paths,
Snakes, wolves, and tigers often harm people—
Hearing the sound, they retreat without trace—
Stay and sit, keep the Great Cavern Scripture in mind.

Scholars and literati with minds blocked like thatch,
Divine youths falter in response, lacking wisdom.
To wield the brush with divine aid,
First, cherish and constantly hold the Great Cavern Scripture.

This body is like illusion, like a bubble,
Within qi and spirit, refine the true.

To preserve one’s form and life as long as heaven endures,
Diligently study and ponder the Wondrous Cavern Scripture of Wen Chang.

Do not rely on vast wealth amassed by noble houses—
Heaven’s decree may strip your blessings, leaving you perilously inclined.
When the time is ripe to cultivate merit and virtue,
Sacrifice your own to print and circulate the Great Cavern Scripture.

With a heart of pure sincerity reaching Shangqing,
One’s devotion moves the Three Spirits to bestow their grace.
This body ascends to the rank of Heavenly Worthy—
All because of steadfast study of the Great Cavern Scripture.

Hear again the words of the Great Cavern Scripture:
Its profound and wondrous text defies all naming.
Boundless merit, beyond all reckoning—
I urge all mortals: do not treat it lightly.

The Primordial Heavenly King expounded the Great Vehicle,
And only those with karmic affinity encounter this sacred scripture.
Should one persist in diligent recitation from beginning to end,
They shall join the assembly of Wen Chang.

**Opening the Dharma Wheel: A Hymn of Praise**

I open the eight gates,
Within lies a jade city.
Seven-jeweled forests of jasper,
Rootless yet flourishing.
Golden boughs intertwine,
Shading and illuminating Shangqing.
The Dharma Wheel of Liberation turns,
Connecting the true and reaching the numinous.
Above, nothing remains unilluminated;
Below, nothing stays obscure.

Behold the Daoist,
Reciting scriptures from dawn to dusk.
Persevering in long fasts and secluded groves,
Unwearied through day and night.
Partaking only of cypress berries at noon,
With pure water and simple fare.
Personally receiving the master’s teachings,
Unswerving in every moment.

Dwelling in solitary cliffs and caves,
Journeying alone through desolate paths.
Forming herds with deer,
Resting body against the forest.
Facing wild beasts in stillness,
While birds cry mournfully above.
Wind and clouds wail in sorrow,
Ten thousand withered things sink into decay.
Ice congeals and fills the ravines,
White snow blankets the courtyard.
Cold plagues pierce the flesh,
Yet resolve remains unshaken.
Bound to the mountains and peaks,
Enduring every hardship.
Never yielding to toil,
Never seeking rest.
Turning ceaselessly in pursuit of the Dao,
At last moving the imperial heart.

Cinnabar script in green characters,
Celestial charts bearing mysterious names.
Divine immortals in feathered robes,
Jade skirts shimmering in flight.
Descending in radiant splendor,
Adorned with fiery bells.
A chariot of flowing rosy clouds,
A three-fold celestial carriage soaring.
Entering my eight gates,
One comes to know life and death—
All determined by accumulated deeds,
Alas, for the sentient beings!

**Hymn on the Extinction of Karma Through the Turning Wheel**

The Dharma Wheel turns, extinguishing karma,
Life and death bend to one’s will.
Accumulated deeds yield clear retribution,
Fortune and misfortune ever alternating.

The worldly seek their past lives,
The enlightened aspire to future returns.
If past merits remain unfulfilled,
Blessings will come, though delayed.

Building upon past exhortations for future deeds,
Once merits are complete, the form ascends of itself.
Immortals of the ten directions in past lives,
Through eons, entered the subtle.

I observe the most devoted scholars,
Yet they fail to embrace others’ hearts.
Diligently serving the master’s treasure,
The master’s protection brings towering blessings.

Disrespecting the master loses this treasure,
All prior merits vanish without effect.
I urge you to perfect your true nature,
The Three Masters guide you through the mystic gate.

If you embody the true Dao,
The Dharma Wheel’s cavern opens of itself.
Do not see this as mere stillness—
Within the hidden depths, it is most profound.

**Hymn on the Root of Life Before Its End**

The Wheel turns through the empty void,
Extinguishing karma, transforming life and death.
Sin and blessing each have their counterpart,
Fortune and misfortune cling without bias.

Attaining the Dao comes from one’s deeds,
Tied to the essence of past lives.
Evil deeds summon cruel retribution,
Dragging one through the five courts of suffering.

Though heaven and earth stretch endlessly,
The mirror of the profound sees all clearly.
I have observed your kind,
Receiving my scriptures from your master.

Yet having gained the scriptures, you betray your master,
Consumed by envy, vying for merit and fame.
Stumbling without self-blame,
Voicing grievances along the way.

This compels the Six Departments to act,
Wielding their brushes to record your form.
When your life ends, you bear the Knife Mountain,
Suffering torment, your body its victim.

Traversing the Three Wretched Paths,
Do you yet perceive your form and name?
Transformed into herds of the six beasts,
Yearning to return to the unseen.

The Dharma Wheel turns ceaselessly,
Coming and going without pause.
Alas for the law of cause and effect—
Retribution comes without delay.

Pitying your ignorance of fate,
I compose this hymn in sorrow.

**Hymn on Turning the Spirit Through Reflection**

Subtly I turn my spirit,
Spreading boundless merit.
The Dao accomplished through eons of heaven and earth,
The Wheel’s transformations unfold through nine realms.

Extinguishing karma, transforming life and death,
Each cause and effect has its origin.
Who awakens to the reasons for coming and going?
Form and soul have no beginning or end.

Accumulated blessings build the foundation of fortune,
Lifting the body from the five peaks of peril.
Freed from the Three Evil Paths,
One enters the serene emptiness.

Contemplating liberation across boundless realms,
Meditation stirs divine resonance.
The Dharma turns in the threefold arena,
Transforming one into a lofty immortal lord.

I retrace my steps of the great *chun* tree,
Soaring into the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

**Hymn on Past-Life Karmic Conditions**

Refraining from killing brings long life,
Free from pain, ever apart from suffering.
All receive heavenly rank,
Body at peace, finding support.

Refraining from theft ensures purity and nobility,
Wealth and treasure naturally gather.
Seven-jeweled palaces arise,
Joy and contentment bring peace to others.

Refraining from lewdness prevents disorder,
The body remains ever pure and clean.
Offspring are upright and proper,
Virtuous conduct brings wisdom.

Refraining from deceit keeps the breath fragrant,
Words remain loyal and steadfast.
Speech issues from the primordial Dao,
Discourse brings merit to fruition.

Never letting wine pass the lips,
No errors or misdeeds arise.
Ever wishing to see blossoms and fruit,
One gains the service of heavenly beings.

At life’s end, ascending to heaven,
The twenty-five spirits come to welcome.
Countless spirits descend of themselves,
Radiant light ever resplendent.

Practicing generosity brings great fortune,
Wealth and treasure come naturally.
Offspring are ever noble,
Transmitting joy through generations.

Upholding precepts with reverence,
Honoring the Nine Worthies.
Devout and free from evil,
One preserves the body’s longevity.

Practicing patience and humility,
Anger never escapes the mouth.
Enduring insults without response,
Blessings and long life come naturally.

Diligence without laziness,
Contemplating the Dao, one attains truth.
Deeds aligning with the Dao,
At life’s end, one becomes a heavenly being.

Unwavering in true devotion,
Loyal and truthful, never deceitful.
Honoring all virtuous ones,
Life knows no hardship.

Those who practice these six virtues
Are reborn as humans.
Faces upright and proper,
Naturally becoming noble.

Stinginess without generosity,
Hoarding wealth, neglecting kin.
Greedily coveting false honor,
Failing to aid the old and poor.

Wives, children, and servants,
Left unclothed, starving in cold.
Sitting idly guarding wealth,
At death, one becomes a hungry ghost,
Body never sated,
Suffering sores and scars.
Begging in vain from east to west,
The family perishes entirely.

Those who craft deceit with their tongues,
In life and death are flayed and maimed.
Molten bronze poured down their throats,
Tongues torn out, extending past their waists.
Forced to swallow, searing their mouths,
Their bellies and bowels rot within.
Living without thought of goodness,
In death, they are plunged into ash and charcoal.

Those who scorn and slight others,
Are tortured for ten thousand years.
Once their sins are exhausted and they emerge,
They become the lowliest of men.

The utterly wicked delight in killing,
Stealing, and acting as violent brigands.
Maimed, they enter hell,
Suffering calamity for ten thousand kalpas.

Those who habitually harbor thieving hearts,
Refusing to repay debts,
Who kill for sport and hunt in the fields,
Or commit unlawful acts in vulgar ways,
Who act without sincerity or trust,
And fly into rage at the slightest word—
Unaware of their own sins,
Preferring falsehood over truth—
Are reborn as beasts,
As oxen, sheep, donkeys, or horses.
Stinking and foul, they bear heavy burdens,
Thus tormented for ten thousand kalpas.

Those who commit incest or violate filial bonds,
Are struck down by thunder and lightning.
In death, they fall into hell,
Hung upside down, scorched by fire.

Those who slander the true Dao with their tongues,
Face extreme suffering in their next life.
Molten bronze poured down their throats,
They endure constant hunger and cold.

Those who give alms without reluctance,
Relieving all to bring peace,
Attain purity and nobility in this life,
And in the world, ascend as immortals.

Those who honor virtue and power,
Observe fasts, and behold true spirits,
Who meditate with unwavering hearts,
See their seven generations rise to heaven.

Those who endure insults without anger,
Are born upright and proper.
Those who study and cherish virtue,
Become the most honored among men.

Those whose hearts are gentle and yielding,
Humble and deferential to others,
Who rescue others from peril,
Extend their own lives.
Those who reverently uphold the Precious Precepts,
Master the Nine Palaces’ Dao,
And wholeheartedly trust in the Void,
Live as long as heaven itself.

Yet there are the foolish and ignorant,
Arrogant and disdainful toward their parents,
Lacking reverence and respect—
They are reborn as lowly men.

Those who see treasures yet fail to bow in reverence,
Who defy and offend their elders,
Who act without kindness or filial piety,
Are reborn as slaves and servants,
Dependent on others for food and clothing,
Driven and beaten day and night,
Suffering endless torment in life,
With no escape even in death.

Those who indulge in lust and debauchery,
Who disbelieve in spirits and gods,
Are reborn to endure hunger and cold,
Their every endeavor beset by hardship.

Those who default on debts yet curse,
Who in poverty revile their ancestors,
Are reborn as oxen or sheep,
Tormented and oppressed by men.

Those who firmly believe in the Way of Life,
Whose compassionate hearts are ever sorrowful,
Who eat plainly and keep their bodies pure,
Ascend to heaven after transformation.

Those who reverently honor the Three Treasures,
Who are not arrogant toward their parents,
Who are utterly sincere and never deceitful,
Are the truly loyal and filial.

Those who guard their tongues from false speech,
Whose hearts encompass all,
Who urge others to shun sin,
And meditate on the Dharma without transgression,
Who aid the destitute and rescue the imperiled—
Their merit and virtue are weighty indeed.
Their years and lifespan increase,
And they enjoy joy and peace all their lives.

Those who befriend others with magnanimity,
Respecting one another as parents,
Who suppress evil and extol virtue,
Whose filial piety and brotherly love move the gods—
Such men are true.

Those who deceive and lie,
Lacking all sincerity,
Whose hearts and words contradict,
Endure filth and disgrace in life.
Those who are perverse and delight in slander,
Fall into hell at death.
Molten bronze poured down their throats,
Their suffering endless in the dark.

Those who drown in wine and hurl curses,
Who disbelieve in spirits and gods,
Have their tongues hooked with iron,
Their pain and torment beyond words.
If they are reborn among men,
Their breath is forever foul and rank,
Hated by all,
Beset by misfortunes.
Evil thoughts constantly befall them,
Wherever they turn, they meet punishment.
Without cause, they are ensnared,
Enduring every kind of agony.
In death, they return to hell,
And in their next life, become beasts,
Trapped in the Five Poisons’ cycle,
Where sorrow, torment, and shame arise.

Those who honor and return to the Three Powers,
Who preach and urge good deeds,
Wish to behold immortals and sages,
And welcome true beings to come.
They wish to embrace all the worthy,
Making them equal to themselves.
With hearts serene and purified,
They refine themselves through the Hundred Precepts.
Day and night, they diligently cultivate and study,
Their wisdom making them heavenly beings.

Yin was transformed in the Western Land,
Universally guiding all to know the true Dao.
Firmly devoted to contemplating immortals,
Their thoughts accumulate without difference.
First, they wish to ascend and wander the Void,
Communing with the subtle and imperceptible.

Accumulate goodness without tiring,
Bestow kindness without reluctance.
Merit and virtue move the immortals,
Who naturally bestow the Elixir.

*Ode to the Supreme by Master Chongmiao*

The Emperor receives Heaven’s mandate,
His sacred lifespan everlasting.
Golden branches flourish,
Jade leaves ever fragrant.
The Five Stars follow their order,
The Seven Luminaries cast their radiance.
Resplendent and glorious,
The numinous verses fill the Void.
Blessing our sagely emperor,
His precious throne boundless.
Heaven clear, earth tranquil,
All realms bathed in light.

The Sacred Mother of the West,
Adorned with precious jade,
Attends the Phoenix Pavilion and Dragon Terrace,
Ever close to the imperial carriage.
Rainbow light pierces the Dipper,
The moon gleams in the Great Void.
The sacred palace, serene and pure,
Forever guards Heaven’s abode.

Flourishing in this era of harmony,
Daily she serves before the Most High.
Dwelling in the Dragon and Phoenix Palaces,
Her name recorded among the immortals.
Burning incense, she thanks Heaven’s grace,
Forever reciting the *Xiyi* chapters.
A thousand lives bring a hundred blessings,
Her place in the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.
Ever abiding in the realm of carefree ease,
She enjoys blessings naturally.

Heaven-born wisdom,
Comes to praise this flourishing age.
Like ice and jade, sharp and pure,
With the bearing of phoenix and simurgh.
Harmonizing the primal transformations,
She aids in the era of peace.
Fields sing with verdant growth,
Arms rest from subduing the four barbarians.
Ever attaining the Five Blessings,
Heaven’s favor eternally gathers.

Resplendent, the verses fill the Void,
Their numinous sound shakes the Nine Heavens.
The Perfected One opens the treasure trove,
Transmitting the *Xiyi* chapters.
The precious gāthā now passes on,
The sacred text delivers ancestors.
Rescuing souls from the long night,
They ascend to the Vermilion Terrace Heaven.

With reverent hearts, they honor what they serve,
Giving thanks before the Void Emperor.
The Jade Emperor proclaims Heaven’s decree,
Universally releasing souls from the dark night.
The Eight Difficulties all dissolved,
The Five Paths all opened.
Fengdu’s retribution ceases,
They ascend to the Vermilion Terrace Palace.
All beings awaken to the supreme Dao,
Forever enjoying boundless blessings.

The Venerable Original Beginning of Jade Capital,
Lord of creation and myriad transformations,
Reveals the sacred text to the Three Officials,
Opening the Nine Dark Prisons below.
In Fengdu’s cauldrons of flame,
Compassion showers the Dharma rain.

The myriad sinful souls are cleansed,
All attain deliverance and transcendence.
With wholehearted devotion they face the Supreme Ultimate,
The Jade Emperor bestows boundless grace.
Heaven’s decree is proclaimed to the earthly prisons,
Opening the path for souls of the long night.
The Nine Dark Halls release the seven generations of ancestors,
The sacred talismans notify the Three Officials.
Immortals together guide them upward,
Ascending to the Vermilion Terrace Heaven.
Forever severed from the roots of karmic transgression,
They eternally enjoy the blessings of nature.

The Great Sage Lord of the Golden Portal,
Master of the myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth,
In compassion showers the sweet dew,
Washing away all dust and delusion.
Expounding the *Kongdong* chapters far and wide,
Universally awakening beings to the Mystery of Mysteries.
Rescuing from the Eight Difficulties’ suffering,
Freeing from the Five Turbidities’ mire.
Delivering beyond the Sea of Six Poisons,
Forever parting from greed, wrath, and delusion.
Immortals together guide them upward,
Carefree they ascend to the Grand Tenuity.
The Jade Emperor bestows divine favor,
Heaven proclaims to the ten thousand spirits.
Rescuing from the Nine Dark Halls’ suffering,
Expounding the Three Caverns’ scriptures.
Names recorded in the Southern Cinnabar Palace,
Souls transcend the Northern Frigid Court.
Forever parted from the cauldrons of flame,
Directly emerging from the City of Ice Pools.
Immortals together deliver them,
Carefree they ascend to the Grand Purity.

*In Praise of the Deliverer from Suffering*
Our Master, the Venerable Deliverer from Suffering in Heaven,
Ever skillfully transforms form across the ten directions.
With this majestic radiance, great compassion arises,
Rescuing those countless beings from boundless suffering.
The Nine Nights’ profound darkness in the gloomy prisons,
Universally illumined to generate light.
The ox-headed jailers all become immortals,
Every sunken soul attains liberation.

*The Hymn of the Four-Eyed Elder*
The Five Qi of the Mysterious Origin,
Expounding the Dharma to cross the ford of delusion.
Beyond images, no image of Dharma,
Within the real, seek the supreme real.
Delusion and awakening lie in the mind’s awakening,
The mind’s numinosity makes the Dharma numinous.
The spirit fundamentally has no Dharma to grasp,
The mind’s vitality generates the spirit.
If my mind is single-minded,
The divine luminaries follow the mind’s movement.
The supreme principle fundamentally has no discourse,
The supreme Dao fundamentally has no words.
All images are false,
The spirit’s numinosity requires my own numinosity.
To penetrate the subtlety within subtlety,
Observe the inner mind in quiescence.
Within and without, no trace of obstruction,
Penetratingly empty, the mind is no-mind.
The mind now free of names and images,
Naturally transcends the immortal courts.
Embracing the One to become the True One,
Carefree they ascend to the Grand Purity.

*The Blood Lake True Sutra’s Hymn*
Reverently bowing to the formless, supreme Dao,
The Great Compassionate Deliverer from Suffering.
Divine radiance of a hundred billion illumines the central darkness,
Compassionate clouds universally cover, drenching with Dharma rain.
The *Xiashi Mingling* Avīci Hell,
The Blood Lake, Blood Sea, and Blood Pool Basin.
The Jade Register’s great amnesty for all sinful souls,
Liberating from the ten thousand kalpas’ suffering of sinking and drowning.
Refining form and delivering life in the Vermilion Terrace Palace,
Awakening to the Dao and ascending to the true through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries.
Vast and towering, merits beyond conception,
Forever serving as the compassionate father to all beings.

*The Marvelous Mind-Seal of Deliverance from Sin: Gāthā and Hymns*
The Dao is vast and clear,
The primordial principle profound and obscure.
Born before Heaven, it governs transformations through the ages.
The Dao has no form,
Clarifying body and mind.
No greed, no desire,
No wrath, no licentiousness.
Right and wrong are not discerned,
Within and without, seek and ponder.
Body and mind pure and serene,
Afflictions do not invade.
No arising, no ceasing,
Abstruse and unfathomable.
Profoundly empty and quiescent,
The mind is no-mind.
Naturally in harmony with the Dao,
All sages come to revere.
Ascending to the Golden Portal,
Roaming and playing in the *Qianlin* groves.
Seven generations of ancestors liberated,
Forever parted from the gloomy darkness.
All accord with the mind-seal,
Awakening to the Dao and uniting with the real.
Thought after thought in succession,
Let no dust-mind arise.
