**Volume One: Ten Poems on the *Bu Xu* (Ascending the Void)**

---
**1.**
A golden altar stands in serene stillness,
The Dao’s great principle, effortless and vast.
Before the Jade Emperor, I take refuge,
Bowing to seek the Source’s true intent.

Incense burns with sacred hymns,
A single mind, undivided, unceasing.
May I join the myriad gods of land and sea,
A billion immortals in celestial grace.

Within the boundless void, enlightenment dawns—
Mystic discourse flows like breath between us.
The True Ones receive their heavenly mandate,
Awakened to the beginning and the end.

Beyond form, delight in boundless ease—
Yet foolish hearts spawn slander and deceit.
With dragon-umbrellas, they ride the six dragons,
Traversing the waters of the eight directions.

---
**2.**
The Jade Seal’s scriptures, taught by the Master,
Rituals honor the Most High.
Praise resounds through the world’s expanse,
Daoist practice and heart align as one.

With *Lingbao* scriptures, all beings are saved,
Danqiu’s clouds and rains gather in shadow.
In emptiness, the *Taiqing* is entered,
White cranes cry out in piercing calls.

All valleys bow in reverence,
Mists and clouds in splendor arrayed.
The dust of the world cannot ensnare,
The secret doors open, then close.

The deepest caverns guard their solemnity,
No bonds hold back the gods and immortals.
Heaven’s height is flat as the palm—
Each moment refined, each detail precise.

---
**3.**
The Most High transforms without end,
Immortal abodes in the Purple Palace reside.
Faith fades like mist into the void,
Bowing to Heaven and Earth, I kneel.

The sky clears, stars scatter like embroidery,
The True Gate holds the One without duality.
Ten states shower with rainflowers,
Five blessings hidden by the True Ones.

Auspicious omens mark their reverence,
Trembling, they lift the sacred vessels.
Oh, noble masters of the Law,
Praying for blessings from the mortal realm.

Three thousand merits fulfilled,
Yet their resolve never wavers.
They take refuge in the Dao’s sovereign,
All spirits record their names.

---
**4.**
The immortals gather in the Mystic Capital,
Where the Dharma Wheel eternally turns.
With fasting bells and precious chimes,
Winter and summer know no heat or cold.

The Crimson Node’s Peach Blossom Palace,
Yingzhou’s shores stretch to distant shores.
The Celestial Sovereign stands attended,
Daoist virtue silences all private speech.

Entering the Great Vehicle’s scriptures,
The six passions dissolve like mist.
Silent, the mind remains steadfast,
Serene, unshaken by doubt.

When the moon shines bright and full,
Fair maidens grind with jade pestles.
Chimes strike in harmonious tones,
Refining essence, granting beauty’s grace.

---
**5.**
Heaven’s laws govern mortal affairs,
The Yellow-robed Sage receives the Jade Seal.
Scriptures open the Dao’s clear vision,
Devotion brings swift fruition.

If evil spirits dare to approach,
Despair grips them like withered grass.
The *Dantian* is the root of life—
Bowing or rising, blessings arise.

Cranes’ bones feast on celestial dew,
Their practice as wild as mountain deer.
Within the Three Powers’ lush abundance,
They hold their scrolls, diligent in study.

Taiyi and the Star Officials,
Bring prosperity without reversal.
Returning to purity, rooted in truth,
The four seasons stretch in perfect measure.

---
**6.**
Aspiring to the Dao, seeking True Nature,
Knowing the One is not to grasp at forms.
First, refine the mind with earnest toil,
Transforming the vulgar into the sublime.

Rituals of repentance must be sincere,
Ascending the platform, bright as day.
The Six *Ding* spirits obey with ease,
Coming and going like swift winds.

Incantations and divine talismans,
No evil spirit escapes their might.
Petitions in green script,
Good and ill, fortune and misfortune revealed.

From *Yuan Shi*’s celestial ranks,
Sacred words divide the cosmic cycles.
Incense, lamps, and ritual tea,
Anointing the divine with sacred ink and brush.

---
**7.**
The Seven-Treasured Lapis Palace,
Flying talismans arrayed in crimson.
*Yujing* governs the ten directions,
All True Ones chant the Mystic Formula.

Heaven and Earth in boundless void,
Clouds drift without end.
The Great Immortal rides a crane in play,
Rituals pure, their solemnity unbroken.

Their praises are beyond compare,
Eternal life, never fading.
The Most High subdues the Demon King,
Their attendants are sages without peer.

They descend to guide the common folk,
Spirit Officials in orderly ranks.
Fragrant flowers trail from their palanquins,
Teaching spreads through every tongue.

---
**8.**
The precious gongs resound with the *Lunyang*,
All immortals gather in assembly.
Measuring virtue’s heights and depths,
The shallow cannot enter their realm.

The *Ruyi* Pearl spins in celestial grace,
Destroying falsehood, nurturing the true.
Before the Jade Emperor’s court,
True Ones stand in silent attendance.

Listening to the *Bu Xu*’s natural flow,
Gazing upward at *Huaxu*’s domain.
Riding cranes or dragons, radiant light ascends,
Three thousand merits fulfilled—
The Elixir Field’s great pearl is refined.

*Xuandu* governs the eight directions,
At the altar, all is lush and verdant.
Breezes spread their teachings far,
Nurturing life through breath’s embrace.

---
**9.**
Sun, moon, five stars shine in justice,
Judging virtue and vice with fairness.
The Three Officials and Five Emperors,
Billions roam in endless delight.

Dharma rains fall as they pass,
Riding clouds, mounted on cranes.
A glance from the *Ruyi* transforms the body,
Their teachings build cities of enlightenment.

Fragrant and vast within the void,
The True Ancestors dwell in tranquil ease.
The Nine Heavens bless all things abundantly,
Jewel forests’ leaves intertwine.

The *Xiang* teachings bring mortal blessings,
Immortal flowers bloom in purple calyxes.
Yin and yang turn the Wheel of Wisdom,
The Great Dao rests in the heart’s foundation.

**10. Ten Poems on the White Crane**

Its snowy feathers cling to dawn’s blush.

While mortals paint it on silk-screen walls.
With peach-blossom fruit, it speaks of millennia’s truth,
In boundless ease, it drifts through ten thousand leagues of sky.

Jade boys escort it to the *Fengchi*’s song.

The white crane’s feathers lean in night’s round moon,
High it flies to stand before the *Bu Xu*’s gate.
On the divine altar, crimson banners sway in dance,
The *Tai Yi* True Person grants virtue and long life.

**7.**
The white crane, a spirit bird of life and years,
Its feathers ever fresh as if newly grown.
Five clouds rise from peaks of thousandfold heights,
Purple-canopied cliffs where sea-born immortals dwell.

**8.**
The white crane’s crest burns deep in crimson hue,
As if *Jiu Tian* listens to its gathered heart.
It follows feathered guests who shun the mortal world,
Seeking jade peach blooms in leagues beyond the sky.

**9.**
The white crane perches on the ninth mountain’s height,
Its plumage pure as spring’s own ice.
Transformed palaces of the *Zhu Tian* lie far,
Its cloud-wings bear it on the Dao’s true flight.
