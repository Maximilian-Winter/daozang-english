**The Venerable Paper Boat’s Direct Pointer to the Complete Reality**
Compiled by Jin Yueyan, lineage-holder of the Orthodox Complete Reality School
Transmitted by Huang Gongwang, lineage-holder of the Great Delusion of the Complete Reality School

The study of Complete Reality directly investigates the profound mystery, being the singular illumination of the supreme Dao. It is not to be compared with the lesser vehicles, miscellaneous teachings, or sundry arts.

Since the emergence of the Five Patriarchs and Seven Perfected Ones, all those in the world who attained the Dao did so through direct self-realization, mind-to-mind transmission, without relying on even a single written word. Herein lies its marvel.

In later generations, as disciples multiplied, those whose masters were authentic transmitted teachings that all aligned perfectly. Those whose masters were inauthentic either practiced rigid sitting and desiccated meditation, or swallowed essence and inhaled qi, or fixated the mind on the kidneys, or杂dabbled in heterodox paths—practices not only futile but harmful.

Moreover, the essential handle of Complete Reality lies in the state before one’s parents were born, where the true is already complete. It neither increases with life nor diminishes with death. If one uses the mind to seal emptiness and awakens to the original true, then the true is naturally complete, the foundation of the Golden Elixir is established, and the basis of the Great Medicine is laid.

Some claim that the Golden Elixir is the path of immortals and must involve esoteric oral transmissions from a master. Others assert that the Great Dao is merely the singular cultivation of the nature school, and that neglecting the life school precludes attaining the immortal path. Here, we dispel this doubt for the multitude.

Consider how fish transform into dragons, rotten wheat into butterflies, sparrows enter water and become clams, clams metamorphose into flying quails, and chaste maidens turn to stone. These beings transmute from the sentient to the insentient, or from the insentient to the sentient. Some transform through the firmness of a single thought, others through contact with yin and yang qi.

From the perspective of their natures, there are differences between flying and burrowing, moving and still, plant and animal. From the perspective of their forms, there are distinctions in scales, shells, feathers, and fur. Their transformations are as wondrous and unfathomable as this. How could there be any esoteric oral transmission from a true master?

The disparity between creatures and humans is as vast as that between heaven and earth. Humans, being the most spiritually endowed of all beings, if they can awaken to the marvel of Complete Reality, maintain unbroken mindfulness, concentrate qi to attain suppleness, illuminate the singular spirit without obscurity, return the six senses to a state of nakedness, guard the One while forgetting the One, and abide in utter emptiness until stillness reaches its extreme—then stillness will stabilize the nature, the nature will stabilize the life, the life will stabilize the Elixir, and the Elixir’s completion will allow the spirit to transform boundlessly.

Human transmutation into immortals is no different from the firmness of thought or contact with qi that transforms creatures. Yet how lamentable that today’s students, with shallow capacities and weak faith in the Dao, harbor ever-growing doubts while their right causes daily diminish. They do not apply themselves with arduous effort yet hope to attain the Dao instantaneously.

They fail to realize that those who attain the Dao instantaneously have all cultivated virtuous fruits over thousands of lifetimes, and only at this juncture, with merit fulfilled and work accomplished, do they attain the Dao instantaneously. Now, with their ordinary fleshly forms, their conduct unrectified and their merit unaccumulated, if they seek the immediate completion of the Elixir Path, it is farther from them than the farthest distance.

Hereafter, we present the seven stages of the Seven Perfected Ones’ simultaneous mastery of form and spirit, the sevenfold return to the unified seal, and the step-by-step instructions for entering the chamber. Though this may stir waves in a windless sky or cast clouds over empty space, if you do not trust these words of this poor Daoist, you may as well await direct transmission from Zhong and Lü.

Yet even if you grasp half, how will you comprehend the other half? A stone maiden takes flight; a wooden man cries out.

**The Ancestor of the Golden Elixir, the Origin of Creation**
The formless gives rise to heaven and earth;
Complete Reality spans ancient and modern.
Enter here from this very place—
Beware of seeking it elsewhere.

The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi;
The One qi, through yin and yang, completes the ten thousand images.
If the master of the house can comprehend this,
Why seek lead in water?

Originally a mass of blood and flesh,
Awareness wholly depends on the yang spirit.
Who animates movement, rest, speech, and silence?
When the spirit departs, there is nothing left to grasp.

Though myriad names and forms are expounded,
They only lead people deeper into delusion.
From this day forth, awakened to Complete Reality,
Marvelous words and wondrous sayings are no longer believed.

Radiance pervades the empty space above and below;
Every person is fully endowed without lack.
Within Complete Reality, the true mechanism is revealed—
True realization is non-dual and non-action.

Sweep away frivolous names and wild characters;
Let not even a speck linger in the breast.
The Seven Perfected and Five Patriarchs were no different—
Awakening to the true transcends the realm of sages.

**Yang Spirit ● Solar Soul**
Form and spirit both verified,
Truly awakened to the ultimate real.
The soul is the yang spirit;
The corporeal soul is the yin form.

Form borrows the spirit’s numinosity—
As the moon’s brightness depends on the sun.

**Yin Form ○ Lunar Corporeal Soul**
The child ever clings to the mother;
The wife follows her husband’s path.
When form and spirit conjoin in stillness,
Yin and yang establish their root.

Thoughts unbroken, continuously,
Over time, they naturally become numinous.
Unceasing in cultivation and realization,
One transcends to the Jade Capital.

**The Sevenfold Return: The Seven Perfected’s Unified Seal**

**Form and Spirit Attend Each Other**
A lifetime spent in drunken dreams, wandering a long road—
Suddenly, one arises to recognize the other.

**Initial Entry into the Dao**
Face-to-face, no place to hide—
Only now, in the moment, does one distinguish near from far.

**Form and Spirit Accompany Each Other**
One day, knowing each other as the utmost real,
From now on, guest and host exchange intimacy.
*Called "Attaining the True"*

Amidst the boundless cosmos, countless people—
Who would believe ice exists within winter’s fire?

**Form and Spirit Merge**
How could a child bear to leave its parents?
Together they walk, sit, and even share garments.
*Called "Preserving the True"*

Were it not for turning to face this son,
It would make Hanshan and Shide’s wives laugh.

**Form and Spirit Embrace**
Pure yang wholly embraces yin,
No need for contrived seeking or pursuit.
*Called "Summoning as if Carving"*

The slightest movement, and the Elixir scatters—
This is gold within the water of eternal life.

**Form and Spirit Both Perfected**
A brocade robe and jade bridle, a dappled steed—
How many times has one journeyed to and from Peach Blossom Spring?
*Called "Inverted Carving"*

Treading emerald and piercing crimson—what was all that for?
Now, at rest, one has already forgotten the way home.

**Form and Spirit Both Released**
The golden lock is torn open—emptiness at both ends,
Not to be confused with the vastness of the Great Ultimate.
*Called "Realizing the True"*

Inverting grasp of Guanghan, returning to the primordial abyss,
Star-strewn lapels stir the winds of heaven.

**Universally Ferrying Later Learners**
Oar strikes oar in ceaseless return—
If you are destined, board this boat.

**Awakening the True through the True**
The true transcends the other shore to become true awakening;
For self-cultivation, one must also cultivate others.

**Entering the Chamber: Essential Steps**
*Constructing the Chamber*
The dimensions of the chamber follow fixed principles.

**Upon Entering the Chamber**
Generally, one must concentrate spirit and gather qi.
When true qi is full, spirit becomes naturally efficacious—
Efficacious, then transformation occurs.

Yet concentrating spirit and gathering qi
Depend entirely on purity and stillness—
One cannot be careless in small matters and hinder great affairs.

**Dietary Precautions**
Impure meat breeds impure qi,
Rank vegetables foster anger,
The five flavors deplete primordial essence—
All must be abstained from.
Do not assume they are harmless or unobstructive to the Great Dao,
For otherwise, qi will not be clear and spirit will not be at peace;
Spirit unsettled, nothing can be achieved.

**On Drowsiness**
At first, sitting often induces drowsiness—
Moderate diet allows qi to flow freely,
An empty mind keeps spirit clear and still.

When drowsiness overtakes you, do not walk,
For walking wearies the spirit,
Wearied spirit scatters qi,
Scattered qi dulls the spirit—
Harmful to oneself, of no benefit to the Dao.
When drowsy, simply rise and walk slowly for a few steps,
Then sit again, rouse the spirit,
Regulate the breath, and return to the root.
Breath returned, qi is born;
Qi born, spirit abides;
Spirit abiding, over time,
The demon of sleep naturally retreats.

**On Prolonged Sitting**
After sitting long, one may feel true qi ascending and descending within,
Or warmth in the kidneys,
Or the body’s subtle movements—
These are merely signs of true qi gradually gathering,
Occasional phenomena, not to be marveled at;
Let them unfold naturally.

After sitting long, at night, sudden openings and closings may occur,
Eyes perceiving light like the sun, moon, or lamp,
Or a vast expanse of brightness, fading gradually or vanishing abruptly—
This is the false radiance of deluded thought,
Not a true realm—
Do not cling to it.

After sitting long, one may see mountains, forests, cities,
Or beloved and detested figures from daily life—
These visions arise from unexhausted perceptions,
Deluded thoughts manifesting—
Sweep them away, pay them no mind.

After sitting long, form and spirit may suddenly be forgotten,
And true realms appear within the body—
Do not delight in them,
For attachment breeds demonic obsession.

After sitting long in the chamber, the heart may suddenly flare,
Producing chaotic visions—
Do not speak of them recklessly to others,
For this is the work of the spirit’s discernment.
If the heart’s restlessness cannot be curbed,
Relax slightly, have someone rouse you—
Awakened, the visions will disperse.

If minor discomfort arises during sitting,
Adjust body and mind, regulate and dispel it.
If the disturbance is unbearable,
Pause to recover,
Then sit again at leisure.

A snail’s breath cannot withstand the cold and heat of heaven and earth—
Take care not to harm life.

After sitting long with mastery,
A "person without position" may suddenly appear and disappear—
Let it be, do not cling to it.
To do so is still illness—
Though it seems thus, do not mistake the empty flowers of a diseased eye.
A single bout of confusion may run rampant,
Yet from the first, you have yearned for the mysterious wind,
Devotedly revering the Supreme Dao.

Longing to forge a three-foot sword,
Would you abandon six pecks of dust?
Your aspiration granted by heaven, your learning should be as vast as the heart—
Having encountered Master Paper Boat,
Imprinted with the wonders of the Complete Truth,
How could I hoard the books of the Great Dao for myself alone?
Thus, I widely disseminate them to the multitude,
Untangling bonds, severing delusion, dispelling doubt.
If both mind and method are illuminated,
A single glance reveals all as if on the palm of the hand.
Do not seek to confine it to the round symbol—
It is like a pearl in water,
Turning light back to its source,
The Complete Truth at this very moment.
Borrowing events to illustrate principle,
What is the meaning of the "turning body" phrase at the end?

**The True Beyond a Single Point, the Seven Perfected Not False**
The mud dragon of the Eastern Sea roars at the purple turtle.
Once the pivot of primordial harmony is penetrated,
Frost and moon fill the sky, the night crow cries.
