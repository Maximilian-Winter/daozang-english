# 至真子龙虎大丹诗

**Preface to *The Supreme Perfection’s Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir Poems***

By Lu Tianzao, *Xuan De* Gentleman, Acting Commissioner of Education for Huainan West Circuit, granted the fish-shaped tally of office

Zhou Fang of Shaoshi Mountain, a recluse in common robes, styled himself *Guiyi* ("Returning to Oneness") and took the Daoist name *Zhizhenzi* ("Supreme Perfection Master"). He often perused the scriptures of immortals, delving into the subtleties of emptiness, exploring the gateways to transcendence, and mastering the pivotal mechanisms of *qi*-refinement. His aspiration was to unite his body with the Void, his heart forgetting the dusty world.

Roaming through various commanderies and traversing many famous mountains, in the regions between the capital and Luoyang, he sometimes encountered lofty adepts. From them, he received transmissions of esoteric teachings, discerning the root and origin of "jade water" and tracing the lineage of the Golden Elixir. He grasped the wondrous functions of the Water Tiger and Fire Dragon, the mysteries of Earth, Metal, Fire, and Water, the proper inversion of Heaven and Earth, and the cyclic signs of day and night.

Zhou Fang listened with rapt attention, his heart stirred and his focus unwavering. Thus, he chose a sacred mountain and selected a true and sublime site. Heaven and Earth became his crucible, the cosmos his furnace; *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) were the essence of the supreme medicine, while lead and mercury formed the substance of the Great Elixir. Relying on the Four Symbols and aligning with the Three Powers, he followed the *wu-ji* (Earth) to perfect its true form and harnessed the River Chariot to refine its essential nature.

When activated, Yin and Yang conjoined; when perfected, the Sun and Moon revolved. The Tiger’s roar resounded before the jade chime furnace, the Dragon’s cry echoed within the golden radiance crucible. Water and Fire coalesced, Dragon and Tiger intermingled, and with flawless timing, the Golden Elixir was achieved.

The Prince of Huai encountered this method and refined "autumn stone," consuming it to ascend with his entire household to heaven. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and delved into the Golden Radiance, riding a dragon to the Han after his repast. This Elixir is neither a mineral nor a herb, nor the techniques of the Three Peaks’ maidens, nor the arts of absorbing essence through countless breaths.

All the above are the results of failing to meet a true master—some obtain mercury but not lead, or comprehend Water but not Fire. Thus it is said: a solitary Yang does not generate, a lone Yin does not give birth. It is like a mother gestating a child or a parrot incubating an egg. If one meets a master’s guidance and obtains the Elixir formula, the work is accomplished, and one’s name is listed among the Upper Clarity; when merit is fulfilled, the body roams the Purple Palace.

Now, I roughly express my humble thoughts to reveal the true mechanism, briefly outlining the grand principles to transmit to like-minded seekers.

Written on the ninth day of the ninth month in the *bingyin* year of the Tiansheng era (1026).

**The Supreme Perfection’s Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir Poems**

Within lead lies mercury, called the Yellow Sprout—
Let no common fool boast idly of its worth.
Master the Dragon and Tiger to harmonize the crucible,
And emulate the Sun and Moon to move the River Chariot.

Arrange the furnace and tripod to fly the golden liquid,
Transforming Heaven and Earth to refine jade radiance.
This method is not like the cicada’s molting—
Freely you shall dwell in the Jade Emperor’s realm.

Discard idle songs and cease reading books,
Hold fast to a single intent to gather the Mystic Pearl.
Within the Heaven-Earth crucible, refine the Three Mercuries,
In the Sun-Moon furnace, simmer the Five Talismans.

Having traversed worldly affairs in full measure,
You can revive withered bones into a true body.
Swiftly complete the work with the *daogui*’s power,
Ride the Tiger and mount the Dragon to ascend to the Jade Capital.

Recognize the root and comprehend *Kun* (Earth),
Then east, west, south, and north become your neighbors.
In *Li*’s palace lies the hidden Nine-Return Elixir,
Within *Kan* is deeply stored the Seven-Rebirth Silver.

When White Snow descends, distinguish *jia* and *yi*,
On the day the Yellow Sprout is born, fix *geng* and *xin*.
When the Golden Elixir’s firing time is complete after three years,
You may float eastward for ten thousand springs.

The Golden Crow and Jade Hare follow an unerring path,
The Three Maidens and Three Boys are originally one family.
The Steed of Intent chases crimson splendor,
The Monkey of the Heart often drifts on white elm blossoms.

Once you attended the Queen Mother’s cup of jade liquid,
Now await Master Ding to split the jade melon.
In the eight hundred *lü* of green, we shall meet,
After a thousand mornings of elixir refinement, leaning on mist and clouds.

For ten years, I toiled through worldly mechanisms,
Yet few know this Way within.
The roc’s strike into the dark sea is not without its day,
The dragon’s leap from cinnabar will come in time.

Sleeves conceal the golden hammer to subdue the Five Tigers,
The casket hides the precious sword to slay the Three Corpses.
With a single thunderous chariot’s shock, Heaven and Earth grow still—
Seizing the luminous pearl within *Kan* and *Li*.

Move mountains and overturn seas with the divine furnace,
Transform the sword into a dragon roaring over Mirror Lake.
A single thunderclap dispels demons,
A thousand leagues of lightning slays yin maggots.

Heaven and Earth have seized the Treasure of Non-Action,
*Li* and *Kan* newly bestow the Pearl of Creation.
The Golden Bones are transmuted by lead and mercury’s power,
A pair of simurghs leads straight to Penglai.

I go to pay homage to the immortals, knocking at the grotto gate,
In Chang’e’s tent, embracing the Dragon’s heir.
Pluck the golden flower and the vermilion sun by their roots,
In the crucible, refine lead frost into the honored vessel of creation.

Subduing Dragon and Tiger is the true endeavor—
Why be bound by the crow and hare’s morning and dusk?
When the great cycle of *jiazi* completes its revolution,
You must ride the River Chariot to cross the sea village.

Gather lead’s radiance to match *jia* and *geng*,
The Sun’s soul and Moon’s spirit determine waxing and waning.
Within the Three Powers’ crucible, attack the golden laughter,
In the Ten Thousand Images’ furnace, refine the stone essence.

The Wild Horse is reined in, Dragon and Tiger cower,
The Mad Monkey is tamed, ghosts and spirits tremble.
When the Gate of Heaven opens, the numinous light arrives—
The distant Milky Way clears, and the earth grows bright.

The Lü family once shared with me true lead,
Only in the Mysterious did I comprehend the Mysterious.
The Red Horse is captured within the Golden Valley,
The Blue Ox is driven before the Jade Stream.

In the night’s starry haze, I pursue the talisman envoy,
At dawn in the cloudy grotto, I dispatch the sword immortal.
Today, I sever the karma rainbow,
And turn the oars to sail the boat home across the blue waves.

The Great Elixir’s single secret originates from the master,
In white memorials and yellow robes, I petition the Red City.
When refining in the golden crucible, I seal the child’s name,
When simmering in the jade furnace, I bind the immortal’s title.

Divine cinnabar subdues fire, enveloped in radiant light,
Spiritual mercury flies and congeals, its aura pure and clear.
After nurturing soul and spirit through nine revolutions,
Within the gourd, all is revealed, penetrating *shenming*.

Erect the sword and stabilize the furnace to refine solar radiance,
The true water within water is called Flowing Rosy Clouds.
In *Li*’s palace lies a path to the Green Dragon’s chamber,
*Kan*’s gate has no door to the White Tiger’s home.

Freely gather White Snow according to the seasons,
Advance to select the day to harvest the Yellow Sprout.
Invert the jade flask to drain the celestial liquid,
Exchange bones for spirit with a single grain of sand.

White gold transmutes to purple, its merit most sublime,
Dissolving aged countenance to restore youthful prime.
The numinous elixir reaches the gourd, stored in *Kan*’s gate,
Divine cinnabar opens the crucible, piercing *Li*’s palace bright.

Dimly one has attained the immortal’s realm,
With topknot and beard, soon to wander the winds of Penglai’s garden.
After refining for a thousand days, open the furnace to see—
Myriad forms all emerge from a single crucible’s gleam.

I bitterly recount these deeds to you in earnest:
When awakened, one must truly comprehend.
Do not recklessly capsize the boat’s oar,
Nor fear the high winds when casting the fishing line.

Smelt the toad’s radiance into mercury within the fire,
Swiftly boil the sun’s essence into silver within the water.
The returning elixir’s precious essence completes its triple cycle,
Wild cranes roam freely while the world’s men toil in vain.

Before your eyes lies the true realm of Five Peaks’ clouds,
Gather the mysterious pearl and sow the valley’s spirit.
Temper the sun’s soul to nourish decaying bones,
Simmer the moon’s essence to gather wandering dust.

Within the crucible, the Yellow Sprout returns to *ren* and *gui*,
In the furnace, White Snow distinguishes *bing* and *yin*.
The Four Symbols secretly unite, Dragon and Tiger in awe,
Riding the waves across the sea to ascend the Celestial Ford.

The crucible is no mere metal vessel—it is true lead,
Ever profound within the profound, distant and abstruse.
When the mare is gathered, she ascends the Purple Court,
When the ox is released, the sun is stored in the Cinnabar Field.

The toad’s palace blazes with *Li*’s Dragon Child,
The phoenix’s cry resounds with *Dui*’s Tiger Immortal.
One must wield the weapons of *jia* and *bing* to deploy water and fire,
Refining autumn stone to naturally prolong the years.

A decade of surging waves, a single breath’s mechanism—
Fishing for the turtle is no idle moment’s task.
Within the gourd, joyous scenes of eternal spring,
Across the seas, carefree wonders in this world arise.

Refined provisions of brocade-scaled fish and rice,
A flask of golden liquid congeals like solid fat.
Through life, untangled by right or wrong,
My clarity stands distinct for all the cosmos to know.

Amidst chaotic peaks, five-colored clouds arise,
Concealing the cinnabar’s most revered name.
Just witness the crucible’s workings of creation,
The Patriarch’s furnace clearly severs all ties.

Heaven and Earth have seized the Infant’s nature,
Lead and mercury will congeal the Crone’s affection.
Once the Dragon-Tiger pill is refined,
Know that upon entering the mouth, even spirits will take fright.

Adorned with the moon and stars, clad in feathered robes,
Such adepts have rarely glimpsed the realm of *Xiyi*.
Mercury arises within lead—how would lead know?
The Dao resides in man, yet man remains unaware.

In the fleeting light of time, days pass in vain,
In the desolate gate and courtyard, how can one seek a master?
Prepare the golden crucible to smelt Dragon and Tiger,
Consume it, and youthful complexion will permeate to the bone.

Before an ancient peak’s stream and stones,
Four seasons of blossoms bloom in another realm.
Sun and moon cast their radiance upon the golden crucible,
Dragon and Tiger roar beside the jade furnace’s gleam.

Within the casket, the sword of stars is forged,
In the satchel, brocade verses are refined.
Severing the yin maggots to purify the cosmos,
Naturally, one regains youth and extends years.

The ninefold cyclical Returned Elixir takes three years,
Requiring the Golden Duke to bind mercury and lead.
The Crone dissolves her palace to face the Purple Gate,
The Infant grasps firm, circulating the Elixir Field.

The Mysterious Pearl is gathered as heaven and earth grow still,
The flowing essence is reclaimed to solidify the universe.
To know the root-matter of longevity,
Know that the root of longevity lies within man.

Men of the world fail to grasp the quest for longevity,
Wandering mountains in vain, seeking quietude.
Who awakens to the need for elixir refinement?
Only through accruing yin virtue is it made clear.

The Flowery Pond nurtures the effortless substance,
Water and fire refine the elusive essence.
Swallowing the Dragon-Tiger treasure from the pot,
The form’s substance must be nourished to ensure enduring glory.

To cultivate the Dao, one must clarify yin and yang,
In the gates of yin and yang, all who perceive prosper.
Know the Dragon’s abode in the Eastern Sea,
The Tiger’s domain in the Western Mountains holds its own direction.

Within the Eight Trigrams crucible, add water and fire,
In the Three Powers furnace, layer blue and yellow.
The Returned Elixir is completed in due time,
Then withdraw to the divine capital, freely raising cups.

Amidst the cosmos, wild cranes and solitary clouds,
A pot of numinous medicine, a single adornment.
In the satchel, transcribing the *Three Clarities’ Records*,
In the sleeve, the hidden dragon-sword slays demons.

For a decade, delving deeply into scrolls,
At six intervals, thirstily drinking wine by the gallon.
Roaming north and south, east and west,
Few share this resonance when encountered.

In the solitude of profound stillness, one harmonizes with the *Xiyi*,
All seas and mountains become as one.
First, restrain the mad monkey,
Then, corral the wild horse.

When white snow arises, distinguish the mercury’s form,
Yellow sprouts grow in harmony with the true wind.
After three years of pure yang in the Returned Elixir,
Ride the crane, carefree, across the eastern sea.

Men of the world do not recognize lead’s blossom,
The crimson snow, Azure Dragon, and White Tiger’s domain.
One must borrow essence and soul, harmonize spirit and vigor,
Refining the primordial liquid into divine cinnabar.

In the Li Palace, fire flourishes, gold births treasure,
At the Kan Gate, the sound of springs yields mercury’s sprouts.
Ingesting it, the cycle of years extends,
The body radiates light, wreathed in auspicious clouds.

The five flavors return as the supreme essence,
Infant and Elder Sister, Crone and Youth forget emotion.
From yin emerges the pure yang substance,
Within fire, the Supreme Simplicity is forged.

Malevolent qi scatters into a thousand scenes,
The primordial spirit is gathered into a singular name.
Upon reaching the pot, swallow the Li Dragon’s child,
Reverse aging, refine the visage, and bones grow clear.

Seizing the golden rainbow, snatching the pearl,
Alive, it is swallowed—sweet as cream.
The divine sword flies as the Black Dragon flees the sun,
Iron talismans quell sea monsters in their flight.

White snow revives the soul, filling the jade coffer,
Yellow sprouts’ precious essence ignites the red furnace.
The Flowery Pond irrigates the numinous tortoise’s triumph,
All phenomena converge within the crucible-pot.

One thing divides into myriad forms,
With steadfast resolve, cultivation is not arduous.
Simply blend jade water with lead and mercury,
Rely on golden radiance to descend the fire elixir.

The medicine penetrates the Three Passes, hastening to the Kan Gate,
The spirit clears the Six Viscera, guarding the Mud Pill.
Burning incense, upholding precepts in reverence,
True immortals will descend upon the sacred altar.

The Supreme Dao is clear, its affairs unburdened,
In its simplicity, how could it be difficult?
The Dragon hides within the two-eight gate,
The Tiger rests within the three-five number.

Lead and mercury harmonize as the Azure Phoenix’s marrow,
Raven and toad pair with purple coral’s teeth.
The maiden of the south can gather it in her palm,
Bringing it back to craft the Great Elixir.

The upper and lower mysteries hold celestial secrets,
The Great Dao requires clarity of the three-five-one.
After winter, yang stirs within the Qian trigram,
At the spring equinox, the Kun hexagram’s lines complete.

The Dragon divides metal and water, slaying geng and xin,
At the summer solstice, fire and wood follow jia and yi.
The secret of the Returned Elixir is subtler still,
Naturally, the heart roams free and at ease.

Refining the elixir, discern yin and yang with care,
Within one pot, two things prosper.
When identifying the medicine, clarify the crucible,
On the day of practice, select the furnace’s direction.

The Three Powers triumph as heaven and earth’s sovereign,
The Four Symbols submit to the king of sky and land.
Consuming the Dragon’s essence and Tiger’s mercury,
Naturally, one claims dominion in the immortal realm.

The crow and hare gallop beneath the Jade Void,
The River Chariot transports it toward the jade pot.
Refining the elixir requires the Three Powers’ crucible,
Nurturing the medicine demands the Four Symbols’ furnace.

Lead and mercury are refined into flowing liquid,
Dragon and Tiger are tempered into descending true cream.
Once, the Yellow Emperor ascended the azure clouds,
Leaving traces for the resolute man to follow.
