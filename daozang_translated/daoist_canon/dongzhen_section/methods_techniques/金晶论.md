**Preface to the Treatise on the Golden Essence (Jīnjīng Lùn Xù)**

The Golden Essence is the foundation of creation, the Dao of the Void, the manifestation of emptiness within discourse on emptiness, and the principle governing heaven and earth. It is both empty and yet present, both colored and yet empty—knowing emptiness while not being empty, knowing color while not being colored. Its essence is initially dim and indistinct, yet its radiance is named as the wondrous sound.

Gold is the pure *qi* of the moon’s luminosity;
The Essence is the true crystal of the sun’s brilliance.
Thus, the sun’s *qi* generates one, which divides into the two *yī* (polarities),
And when the two polarities are complete, the Three Talents stand—
Heaven, Earth, and Man.

Hence, the heavens are round while the earth is square,
The clear *qi* forms heaven, the turbid *qi* forms earth,
And man is the harmonious *qi* of the central balance—
Holding the essence in vague wonder,
Being the substance within the void,
And arising from emptiness as form.

Man dwells in the transient world.
One must know the nature of illusion and transformation,
As the *Yīnfú Jīng* (Scripture of the Hidden Symbol) states:
*"The living are the roots of the dead; the dead are the wood of the living."*
I fear that those who cultivate the Dao
Do not grasp sacred truth,
Struggle to penetrate the gates of the rare and sublime,
Fail to comprehend its words,
And recklessly contrive their own interpretations,
Never attaining the path of refinement,
Lost in futile pursuits,
Wasting their efforts in vain.

Moreover, to refine the Dao,
One must understand the true principles of the Five Phases and Yin-Yang.
Seize the Golden Essence,
And it becomes the treasure-pillar of heaven and earth—
Only when the Five Peaks crumble will its decline be seen.

I worry that later disciples, aspiring to transcendence,
Do not awaken to the true teaching,
And retreat midway,
Falling into the depths of suffering,
Never escaping the river of desire,
And sinking into the sea of misery.

Thus, I expound the *Treatise on the Golden Essence* in three sections,
To spread it in the transient world,
And guide those who refine the Dao,
To reveal its true principles,
To seize the power of creation,
And attain the wondrous Way.
Divided into three parts: Upper, Middle, and Lower.

If there are resolute scholars,
Who transmit this treatise,
They must solemnly swear,
Kneeling and burning incense,
Offering ten *liǎng* (two-tenths of a *catty*) of gold,
Then may they pass it on.

If they encounter unworthy disciples,
They must not transmit it—
This is the celestial secret.
Hurry and do not pass it lightly,
Lest the celestial secret be revealed.

If transmitted to the right person,
It is called *"degree bestowed in the Southern Palace"* (Nángōng),
Ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

If not transmitted to the right person,
The calamity falls upon the seven ancestors.
If indiscriminately transmitted,
The calamity falls upon the nine ancestors,
Forever sinking into the abyss,
Drowning in the sea of suffering,
And becoming a lowly ghost.

Even if one attains a human body,
It will surely be one of poverty and lowliness,
Never whole or complete.

Thus, the *Treatise on the Golden Essence* is placed here—
To awaken understanding and guide refinement,
So that one’s body may transcend into sainthood,
And their essence may be clothed in immortal raiment,
Drinking the nectar of jade,
Feasting on celestial food.

This text merely outlines the broad principles,
Hence its preface is written,
To make clear the profound treatise,
And examine its detailed intent.

**Treatise on the Golden Essence: Upper Section (Jīnjīng Lùn Shàng Piān)**

The Golden Essence, in matter, is Yang—
Its hue contains white, and it is named *hóng* (mercury).
*Hóng* is quicksilver, not the common quicksilver of the world.
According to the Five Phases, it belongs to the West,
Called *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin) as the Heavenly Stems,
Called *shēnyǒu* (Shen and You) as the Earthly Branches,
Born from its soil, dying in fire,
Able to subdue wood and manifest water,
And transform into *qiān* (lead),
Then return.

Water is the child of gold;
Gold is the mother of water.
As they exchange their *qi*,
They are called *hóng* (mercury).
*Hóng* is neither clear when settled nor turbid when stirred—
Only when refined by fire does it become silver,
And then it transforms into gold.

Gold is called the Tiger,
Not the Tiger of the mundane world.
The *Yì* (Classic of Changes) says:
*"Treading on frost, one encounters solid ice."*
Ice is quicksilver, differently named as *hóng* (mercury).
The *Yīnfú Jīng Sòng* (Commentary on the Scripture of the Hidden Symbol) states:
*"Seizing mercury, one refines the elixir, and lives as a mortal."*

Mercury is the Essence, hence it is called *Tàiyáng Jīng* (Essence of the Great Sun).
Thus, the Essence of Yin-Yang descends from fire into the *Dāntián* (elixir field).
The *Dāntián* is Earth, where Earth generates gold—
This is called the Golden Essence.

The Golden Essence is the root of man,
The pure *qi* of the lower *yuán* (origin),
Also called *Chàinǚ* (the Astonished Maiden),
Or *Jīnyè* (Golden Fluid),
Or *Huándān* (Returning Elixir),
Or *Yùyè* (Jade Fluid).

The celestial transformation of the Five Fluids’ essential secret,
The Dao’s summation of the thousand transformations’ key words—
Thus, in the worldly kalpa (age),
If one seeks to harm themselves,
The complete method risks revealing the celestial Dao,
And lightly spilling it upon mortals,
Leaving no trace behind.

Only when the Golden Essence undergoes nine transformations,
And the elixir returns crimson,
Will one nourish life and benefit their family—
No other path surpasses this!

**Treatise on the Golden Essence: Middle Section (Jīnjīng Lùn Zhōng Piān)**

The Golden Essence is the principle of lead and mercury.
Heaven and Earth’s creation:
Heaven obtains the Essence and becomes one—*able to move*;
Earth obtains the Essence and becomes one—*able to remain still*;
Man obtains the Essence and becomes one—*all affairs are accomplished*.
Heaven obtains the Essence and becomes spirit;
Earth obtains the Essence and becomes luminous;
Man obtains the Essence and becomes *qíngxìng* (emotions and nature).

*Qíngxìng* is the root of man,
The gateway to life and death.
If one seeks life,
They must seek the guardian of the life-gate at the life-gate itself—
This is the calculation for longevity.

The Golden Essence is lead and mercury,
Which, when obtained, naturally merge.
The Dragon and Tiger capture and release each other,
And the Golden Essence forms.

The Dragon and Tiger are the Five Phases of gold and wood—
Gold is the Tiger, wood is the Dragon.
The Tiger is named *hóng* (mercury), the gold-water;
The Dragon is *qiān* (lead), wood-fire.
The Dragon and Tiger are *yìngmìng* (life and death),
Lead and mercury are the Yin-Yang husband and wife.

Lead is the infant,
Mercury is the maiden—
Both originate from one source,
Yet ultimately bear different names.
One is black, the other white,
But their true nature is the same.

Now, the world seeks the Tiger in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),
And searches for the Dragon in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),
Yet they do not know that both are within the body itself.
The Dragon resides in *gēngxīn* (Geng and Xin),
The Tiger dwells in *jiǎyǐ* (Jia and Yi),
Fire is used in *rénzǐ* (Ren and Zi),
And it abides in *bīngdīng* (Bing and Ding).

The sages of old did not directly record their methods,
Leaving later scholars and aspirants bewildered—
They vainly conjectured, wasted their efforts,
And spent their lives in vain pursuit,
Only to grow decrepit, achieving nothing,
Yet destroyed the true path and spawned false doctrines.

If I do not leave traces behind,
The path to immortality may be lost forever.
Thus, I record these words,
So that future seekers may follow the pattern.

It is said: The Dragon is born wrapped in fire,
The Tiger emerges from water.

Again, it is said:
The Dragon is not bound in *shùmíng* (束瞑),
The Tiger is not found in the Western lands.

**Gold-Crystal Theory (Lower Section)**

Heaven is clear, Earth is turbid;
Heaven is Yang, Earth is Yin;
Heaven is Father, Earth is Mother.

Heaven is *yīqì* (one *qi*),
Earth is *èryí* (two *yì*),
Man is *sāncái* (three *cái*)—
This is the Yellow, Black, and White.

Yellow is Earth,
Black is Water,
White is Metal.
When Earth, Water, and Metal unite,
They are called *jīnjīng* (Gold-Crystal).

*Jīnjīng* belongs to *qián* (乾, Heaven),
Where Metal is the Father,
And to *kūn* (坤, Earth),
Where Metal is the Mother.

Metal is born from Earth,
Water from Metal.
The Earth’s pure *qi* ascends to Heaven,
Yin and Yang interact,
And thus *jīnjīng* is formed.

*Jīnjīng* ascends to the *Lí* Palace (sepal),
Then passes into the *Huá* Pool (bladder),
Becoming *jīnyè* (津液, vital fluids),
Descending to the *Dāntián* (elixir field),
And becomes *gōng* (mercury).

*Gōng* is blood,
Blood enters the bones as marrow,
Like oil exhausted, the lamp goes out—
When marrow is spent, life ends.

Thus it is said:
To seek immortality, replenish the *jīnjīng* and nourish the brain;
To strengthen the body, refine the fluids and store them in the *Míngtáng* (bright hall).

When the fluids fill the *jīnjīng*,
Life and essence endure.

The *Míngtáng* is the inner chamber of the body,
With a sealed and solemn *dòngfáng* (inner sanctum),
Where the maiden (*lǎonǚ*, lead) is paired with the golden youth (*jīnláng*, mercury).

The golden youth is lead,
Lead is the infant,
When *jīnjīng* is full and the fluids flow,
They enter the *wěiwèn* (尾问, tail gate),
Carried by the *Héchē* (river vehicle) into the *shèntáng* (kidney chamber).

The *shèntáng* is the root of life and essence,
The origin of humanity,
Within which lie two orifices—
The left is *Tiānguān* (Heaven’s Gate),
The right is *Dìhù* (Earth’s Door).
When *jīnjīng* is firmly secured,
Do not let it scatter—
Thus prolonging life and strengthening essence.

It may be used on *chǒuwèi* (丑未) days and hours,
Drawing *yùn* (circulation) to the *níwán* (泥丸, brain),
Called *bǔnǎo* (supplementing the brain).
If on *yínshēn* (寅申) days,
Capture the *jīnjīng* and refine it with fire,
Naturally forming the elixir—
Called *qīfǎn língshā* (seven-returned soul sand).

Frequently observe the fire’s intensity,
Always capturing the *jīnjīng*,
It will naturally become the Great Medicine.

The body transcends to sainthood,
Detaching from the mundane—
Like the Dragon shedding its bones,
Wherever the mind intends,
Instantly it arrives.

The body wanders the Five Lakes,
The Ten Isles and Two Isles,
Riding the clouds in freedom.

I fear those who do not understand these words,
So I further expound the *Jīndān Dàyào* (Great Golden Elixir),
The *Jīnjīng Lǐan Gǒng* (True and False Dragon-Tiger),
In eleven songs—
Examine and practice them.

**Song One:**
To refine *jīnjīng* into cinnabar,
Enclose it in the crucible with golden flowers,
The vulgar do not believe in the secret of longevity—
Though the nine transformations are complete, do not boast.

**Song Two:**
The divine elixir is said to have many methods,
Yet sparrows cannot give birth to phoenixes.
Only true lead and true mercury suffice—
All else fails the alchemical test.

**Song Three:**
The Dragon of *jiǎyǐ* (甲乙) emerges from *Lí* (sepal),
The Tiger of *gēngxīn* (庚辛) is born from *Kǎn* (abyss).
As husband and wife, they harmonize,
Unchanged from their original nature and emotion.

**Song Four:**
The sage’s words praise the yellow sprout,
Where Metal and Water generate in one crucible.
Branches transform into Dragon and Tiger,
*Kǎn* and *Lí* unite in the *Zǐhé Chē* (purple river vehicle).

**Song Five:**
Before *Kǎn* (male) and *Lí* (female) unite,
They are paired by Heaven as the two *yì* (principles).
Once they become husband and wife,
They are named *Shèngwúzhī* (the Unknowable Sage).

**Song Six:**
Everywhere hides the Dragon and Tiger in symbols,
Everywhere *Kǎn* and *Lí* are obscured.
From ancient times, none have recognized them—
How could the sages deceive *Xīqí* (希夷)?

**Song Seven:**
Within the furnace, nine refinements reveal *jīnjīng*,
Red frost flakes like powder—light as down.
A hundred *hú* of pearls cannot compare in worth,
For it is the path to celestial realms.

**Song Eight:**
Take one grain and crush it to dust,
Slowly draw mercury over the fire.
Who covets a hall filled with pearls and jade?
Detaching from the mundane makes one a true immortal.

**Song Nine:**
Meeting and speaking vaguely—
Who among them grasps the truth?
Mere combinations of Four Yellows and Eight Stones—
How could they know the White Tiger and Dragon are kin?

**Song Ten:**
On *rényín* (壬寅) days, extract the golden Tiger from water,
On *wùjǐ* (戊己) days, refine the wooden Dragon in the furnace.
It relies on the *Zhūquè* (朱雀, Vermilion Bird)’s power in the South,
Diligently guarding the *Chìtóng Gōng* (赤彤宫, Crimson Palace).

**Song Eleven:**
The male and female meet in the center,
At twenty-eight years of age, their essence aligns.
The General must introduce them,
And the Golden Official must bind them in marriage.

The *Gold-Crystal Theory* concludes.
